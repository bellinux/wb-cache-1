6000|$|The Musketaquid, or Grass-ground River, though {{probably}} {{as old as}} the Nile or Euphrates, did not begin to have a place in civilized history, until the fame of its grassy meadows and its fish attracted settlers out of England in 1635, when it received the other but kindred name of ^Concord^ from the first plantation on its banks, which appears to have been commenced in a spirit of peace and harmony. It will be Grass-ground River as long as grass grows and water runs here; it will be Concord River only while men lead peaceable lives on its banks. To an extinct race it was grass-ground, where they hunted and fished, and it is still perennial grass-ground to Concord farmers, who own the Great Meadows, and get the hay from year to year. [...] "One branch of it," [...] according to the historian of Concord, for I love to quote so good authority, [...] "rises in the south part of Hopkinton, and another from a pond and a large cedar-swamp in Westborough," [...] and flowing between Hopkinton and Southborough, through Framingham, and between Sudbury and Wayland, where it is sometimes called Sudbury River, it enters Concord at the south part of the town, and after receiving the North or Assabeth River, which has its source a little farther to the north and west, goes out at the northeast angle, and flowing between Bedford and Carlisle, and through Billerica, empties into the Merrimack at Lowell. In Concord it is, in summer, from four to fifteen feet deep, and from one hundred to three hundred feet wide, but in the spring freshets, when it overflows its banks, it is in some places nearly a mile wide. Between Sudbury and Wayland the meadows acquire their greatest breadth, and when covered with water, they form a handsome chain of shallow vernal lakes, resorted to by numerous gulls and ducks. Just above Sherman's Bridge, between these towns, is the largest expanse, and when the wind blows freshly in a raw March day, heaving up the surface into dark and sober billows or regular swells, skirted {{as it is in the}} distance with alder-swamps and smoke-like maples, it looks like a smaller Lake Huron, and is very pleasant and exciting for a landsman to row or sail over. The farm-houses along the Sudbury shore, which rises gently to a considerable height, command fine water prospects at this season. The shore is more flat on the Wayland side, and this town is the greatest loser by the flood. Its farmers tell me that thousands of acres are flooded now, since the dams have been erected, where they remember to have seen the white honeysuckle or clover growing once, and they could go dry with shoes only in summer. Now there is nothing but blue-joint and sedge and <b>cut-grass</b> there, standing in water all the year round. For a long time, they made the most of the driest season to get their hay, working sometimes till nine o'clock at night, sedulously paring with their scythes in the twilight round the hummocks left by the ice; but now it is not worth the getting when they can come at it, and they look sadly round to their wood-lots and upland as a last resource.|$|E

50|$|The {{park has}} {{very little in the}} way of wetlands. Near the river there is a 6 acre area of {{standing}} water with cattails, bulrushes, and arrowhead. 7 acre along the creek are classified as wet meadow with reed canary grass, bluejoint, sedges, and <b>cut-grass.</b>|$|E
50|$|Blue-winged teal are surface feeders and {{prefer to}} feed on mud flats, in fields, or in shallow water where there is {{floating}} and shallowly submerged vegetation plus abundant small aquatic animal life. They mostly eat vegetative matter consisting of seeds or stems and leaves of sedge, grass, pondweed, smartweed (Polygonum spp.), duckweed (Lemna spp.), Widgeongrass, and muskgrass (Chara spp.). The seeds of plants that grow on mud flats, such as nutgrass (Cyperus spp.), smartweed, millet (Panicum spp.), and Rice <b>Cut-grass</b> (Leersia oryzoides), are avidly consumed by this duck. One-fourth of the food consumed by blue-winged teal is animal matter such as mollusks, crustaceans, and insects.|$|E
50|$|Leersia oryzoides is {{a species}} of grass known by the common name rice cutgrass or just <b>cut-grass.</b> It is a {{widespread}} grass native to Europe, Asia, and North America and present in many other regions, such as Australia, as an introduced species. This is a rhizomatous perennial grass growing to a maximum height between 1 and 1.5 meters. The leaves are up to about 28 centimeters long and have very rough, minutely toothed edges. The inflorescence is a loose, open array of wavy, hairlike branches bearing rows of spikelets. Each spikelet is a flat fruit with a rough, bristly lemma without an awn, and no glumes. Some of the spikelet branches develop within the sheaths of the leaves and are cleistogamous. This grass is sometimes used for erosion control and restoring wetlands.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} varying {{concentrations}} of two chelators: EDTA, citric acid (CA), and phosphorus on {{the accumulation of}} arsenic in soil by two perennial grasses, Leersia oryzoides and (rice <b>cut-grass)</b> Festuca arundinacea (tall fescue). Each experiment was run for eight weeks, after which plants were harvested, oven-dried, digested in acid and analyzed using an ICP-OES. Phosphorus soil amendments were applied as 0, 15, 30, 60, 120 mg P/kg soil. For the first chelator experiment, CA and EDTA concentrations of 0, 2. 5, and 5. 0 mmol/kg soil were added in pulse form to the soil. In the second chelator experiment, concentrations of CA were added in 0, 2. 0, 4. 0 mmol/kg soil and EDTA was added as 0, 0. 25, 0. 50 mmol/kg soil. Both plant species accumulated enough arsenic in the root and shoot tissues to be considered at hyperaccumulator species. Citric acid produced comparable results with EDTA, and is considerable much safer for the environment than any synthetic chelator. Certain soil amendments (citric acid and phosphorus) and hyperaccumulator species {{used in this study}} warrant further research in the field...|$|E
40|$|Wetlands {{constructed}} {{for the treatment}} of urban wastewater effluent have gained world-wide popularity in recent decades. Placement of such wetlands near airports however, is strongly discouraged by the U. S. Federal Aviation Administration, other national airport authorities, and the International Bird Strike Committee because they attract birds that may increase strike risks for aircraft. Despite recognition of this and other wildlife hazards to aircraft and efforts implemented to limit such land-use activities near airports, validated methods are still urgently needed to mitigate wildlife hazards on or near air-ports because bird populations and bird-aircraft strikes in the U. S. and elsewhere around the world persistently trend upward. The city of Augusta, Georgia USA designed and developed 144 ha of wastewater treatment wetlands on land adjacent to its Regional Airport at Bush Field during 1997 – 2002. In December 2001, we began temporal and spatial monitoring of bird activities in this area, recording species, their numbers, and flight characteristics. Within 2 years of completion, the wetlands, dominated by giant <b>cut-grass</b> (Zizaniopsis miliacea) and cattails (Typha spp.), served as a nighttime roost for millions of migratory blackbirds (family Icteridae) that crossed the airfield in massive flocks daily at sunrise and sunset during November–March. Beginning in December 2005, we investigated the efficacy of habitat alteration techniques to displace the blackbirds, including the use of airboats to mechanically crush wetland vegetation in portions of the treatment wetlands. The results of this method were highly significant, with far fewer blackbirds landing in crushed-vegetation areas than in uncrushed areas. Beginning with the fall of 2008, this vegetation-crushing technique was implemented annually for the entire wetland system; long-term post-crush bird monitoring indicated that blackbird roosting within the wetlands was almost non-existent and blackbird activity around the airport was reduced by about 2 orders of magnitude. The ability of the wetland vegetation to process wastewater effluent was not negatively affected by vegetation alteration. This work successfully demonstrated that with thoughtful wildlife hazard management, including the consideration of novel techniques, {{it may be possible to}} mitigate large-scale undesirable wildlife attraction associated with certain land-use activities. Importantly, this success was accomplished through non-lethal means, using a relatively simplistic habitat altering technique. Throughout the succession of these events, careful monitoring of bird-aircraft strikes, bird numbers and their movements, and an unbiased evaluation of bird mitigation efforts formed the foundation of the success that was achieved...|$|E
