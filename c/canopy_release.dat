40|$|Key messageThe {{position}} {{of trees in}} the canopy impacts xylem structure and its inter-annual variation. After <b>canopy</b> <b>release,</b> {{the increase in the}} hydraulic conductivity of growth rings was driven by an increase in radial growth in large trees, and by both an increase in radial growth and changes in xylem structure in saplings. ContextForest canopies are frequently subjected to disturbances that allow understory trees to access the upper canopy. The effect of <b>canopy</b> <b>release</b> on xylem anatomy has been assessed in juvenile trees and saplings, while the potential acclimation of larger trees remains poorly documented. AimsWe estimated the potential hydraulic conductivity of growth rings in large understory trees compared to overstory trees, and evaluated the responses to <b>canopy</b> <b>release</b> in large trees and in saplings. MethodsWe recorded radial growth, wood density, and vessel structure in beech trees according to their position within the canopy and their size. Xylem traits were followed during 6 years after <b>canopy</b> <b>release</b> for large trees, and during 2 years for saplings. Vessel diameter and frequency as well as ring area were used to compute the potential annual ring hydraulic conductivity. ResultsLarge understory trees displayed lower radial growth increments and lower potential annual ring hydraulic conductivity than overstory trees. After <b>canopy</b> <b>release,</b> potential annual ring hydraulic conductivity increased in large trees, due exclusively to increased radial growth without any change in specific hydraulic conductivity. It increased in saplings due to both increased radial growth and increased specific conductivity.

40|$|The {{exchange}} {{process in}} the lower region of a maize canopy is analyzed for two nights. It appears that during calm nights a free convection state develops in the lower region of the canopy. Convective heat is released at the soil's surface and transported directly to the higher portion of the <b>canopy.</b> The <b>released</b> sensible heat at the soil's surface can be easily calculated by applying the Nusselt number for free convection. At night thermal energy is also released through cooling of the <b>canopy.</b> The <b>released</b> heat from the stored canopy heat is of the same order of magnitude as all other energy terms. Conversely during daytime for most agricultural crops this energy term is of minor importance {{in comparison to the}} other energy terms. The formation of dew at night is an important process. A maximal possible estimate of dew accumulation for a particular night can easily be made by using the potential dew. The potential dew can be deduced more accurately by taking into account the released heat stored in the plant canopy...|$|R

40|$|A {{computerized}} system for dispensing insect sex pheromones at various release rates is presented. The installation {{consists of an}} electronic device which, through a suitable timed dripping system, distributes the pheromone formulate on a plaited filament that moves within the orchard. The pheromone- impregnated thin rope runs over a system of pole-mounted pulleys above the tree <b>canopy,</b> <b>releasing</b> the semiochemical into the orchard. The versatility of such a mating-disruption system makes it possible: i) to distribute different pheromones {{at the same time}} and on the same support as required; ii) to avoid possible chemical treatments due to dispenser depletion in the last part of the season; iii) to change the operational parameters, in particular the timing and the dosage of pheromone dispensing, according to: a) time of the day during which adults are active for mating; b) trap catches in the reference field; c) possible trap catches within the disrupted orchard. Field tests were carried out in the period 2000 - 2001 on apple and pear orchards to control Codling moth (Cydia pomonella), Oriental fruit moth (C. molesta) and the Leafrollers complex. The amount of pheromone released during the season varied from 160 to 220 g, according to the species to be controlled and their respective populations.

40|$|To {{demonstrate}} potential future {{consequences of}} land cover {{and land use}} changes beyond those for physical climate and the carbon cycle, we present an analysis of large-scale impacts of land cover and land use changes on atmospheric chemistry using the chemistry-climate model EMAC (ECHAM 5 /MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry) constrained with present-day and 2050 land cover, land use, and anthropogenic emissions scenarios. Future land use and land cover changes are expected to result {{in an increase in}} global annual soil NO emissions by ~ 1. 2 TgN yr- 1 (9 %), whereas isoprene emissions decrease by ~ 50 TgC yr- 1 (- 12 %). The analysis shows increases in simulated boundary layer ozone mixing ratios up to ~ 9 ppbv and more than a doubling in hydroxyl radical concentrations over deforested areas in Africa. Small changes in global atmosphere-biosphere fluxes of NOx and ozone point to compensating effects. Decreases in soil NO emissions in deforested regions are counteracted by a larger <b>canopy</b> <b>release</b> of NOx caused by reduced foliage uptake. Despite this decrease in foliage uptake, the ozone deposition flux does not decrease since surface layer mixing ratios increase because of a reduced oxidation of isoprene by ozone. Our study indicates that the simulated impact of land cover and land use changes on atmospheric chemistry depends on a consistent representation of emissions, deposition, and canopy interactions and their dependence on meteorological, hydrological, and biological drivers to account for these compensating effects. It results in negligible changes in the atmospheric oxidizing capacity and, consequently, in the lifetime of methane. Conversely, we expect a pronounced increase in oxidizing capacity as a consequence of anthropogenic emission increase...|$|E
5|$|Forest pests {{present a}} {{significant}} problem {{because it is not}} easy to access the canopy and monitor pest populations. In addition, forestry pests such as bark beetles, kept under control by natural enemies in their native range, may be transported large distances in cut timber to places where they have no natural predators, enabling them to cause extensive economic damage. Pheromone traps have been used to monitor pest populations in the <b>canopy.</b> These <b>release</b> volatile chemicals that attract males. Pheromone traps can detect the arrival of pests or alert foresters to outbreaks. For example, spruce budworm has been monitored using pheromone traps in Canadian forests for several decades.|$|R
40|$|Two {{species of}} banksia, studied {{on the south}} coast of Western Australia, flowered {{simultaneously}} and had floral characteristics often associated with vertebrate pollination. The pollen of both was carried by honeyeater birds and small mammals (honey possums).

Banksia baxteri set much seed {{in the absence of any}} animal visitors and seed set increased with invertebrate, but not vertebrate, visitation. We suggest that these differences in pollination strategies reflect regeneration by B. baxteri solely from <b>canopy</b> seeds <b>released</b> after fire, whereas B. attenuata also regenerates from seeds released between fires, as well as from lignotubers and epicormic buds...|$|R
5|$|Many {{species of}} bird, in {{particular}} honeyeaters, forage at the flower spikes, as do native and European honeybees. The response to bushfire varies. Some populations are serotinous: they {{are killed by}} fire and regenerate from large stores of seed which have been held in cones in the plant <b>canopy</b> and are <b>released</b> after a fire. Others regenerate from underground lignotubers or suckers from lateral roots. Although {{it has been used}} for timber, Banksia marginata is most commonly seen as a garden plant, with dwarf forms being commercially propagated and sold.|$|R
500|$|As {{with other}} {{species in the}} genus, B.serrata trees are {{naturally}} adapted {{to the presence of}} regular bushfires and exhibit a form of serotiny known as pyriscence. The seedbank in the plant's <b>canopy</b> is <b>released</b> after bushfire. Fire intervals of 10 to 15 years are recommended for the Eastern Suburbs Banksia Scrub, as longer leads to overgrowth by coastal tea tree (Leptospermum laevigatum), while an interval of at least nine years was indicated in a study at Brisbane Water National Park. Repeated intervals of five years' duration or less will result in decline of population as young plants are not yet resistant to fire, and their tall habit makes them especially vulnerable. The seedbank is most productive between 25 and 35 years after a previous fire, although seedlings may be outcompeted by seedlings of [...] seeder species. A field study found that seeds were dispersed up to [...] from the parent plant in an hour by strong wind.|$|R
50|$|The He 176 {{was built}} to utilise {{one of the new}} Walter engines. It was a tiny, simple aircraft, built almost entirely out of wood, but did possess an advanced, totally {{enclosed}} cockpit, with a frameless single-piece clear nose, through which the pilot's rudder pedal mounts were visible, and a flush upper cockpit glazing which was removable for entering the aircraft, making the cockpit fit completely within the forward, bullet-like contours of the fuselage. The landing gear was a combination of conventional and tricycle gear designs, with the main gear's struts intended to retract rearwards into the fuselage, with a fixed, aerodynamically faired nose wheel and strut, and a retractable tail wheel. A unique feature of the He 176 was its jettisonable nose escape system. Compressed air was used to separate the nose from the aircraft. A drogue chute was used to reduce the opening force required. After the drogue was deployed, the flush-fitting cockpit <b>canopy</b> was <b>released</b> and a conventional pilot/parachute bailout occurred.|$|R
5|$|Lambertia formosa regenerates after bushfire by resprouting {{from its}} woody lignotuber, {{but is also}} {{serotinous}} in {{that it has a}} seed bank held in its <b>canopy</b> to be <b>released</b> after fire. The number of flowers produced by plants growing back from fire peaks two or three years afterwards. A field study in Brisbane Water National Park north of Sydney found that plants that had experienced two short (less than seven-year) intervals between bushfires had reduced reproductive output as measured by lower numbers of follicles, compared with plants in areas which had had no or one short inter-fire interval. Plants can live for over 60 years.|$|R
30|$|Over time, {{repeated}} burning can {{be expected}} to act as a filter selecting for fire-tolerant tree species that will in turn provide stable substrates for similarly adapted lichens to colonize (Bartos and Mueggler 1981, Espelta et al. 2003). The mature pine component of these stands is arguably already functioning in this way, whereas fire adapted hardwood species and associated lichen diversity still need to be recruited into these areas. For example, dry-site and fire-adapted oak species (e.g., post oak and black oak) are being sought as future overstory components in these areas, but recruitment {{in the context of a}} moderately frequent fire regime presents a challenge (see Arthur et al. 2012). Possible approaches to overcoming these limitations include: (1) waiting to re-introduce fire until repeated thinning of the pine <b>canopy</b> has <b>released</b> oaks already present in the understory or midstory and enabled them to grow to sizes (attain a bark thickness) that will be able to resist damage from subsequent understory fires, (2) using ignition techniques or other protection measures (e.g., raking; Williams et al. 2006) to guard selected areas and trees from fire damage within a burn block, and (3) periodically allowing for extended fire-free intervals so that new cohorts can attain sizes that will confer resistance to damage as in (1).|$|R
40|$|Regression of {{conifers}} in European mixed old-growth mountain forests {{has been}} observed {{for a long period}} and studied from different aspects. Old-growth (OG) forests in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) have not experienced heavy air pollution and chronic overbrowsing that have affected many other European OG forests, while climatic and anthropogenic disturbances have been well documented. We analysed stand structure in the Janj OG forest, compared it with inventories of Lom and Perucica OG forests (BiH) and with earlier inventories of the same reserves. At present, OG forest Janj is characterized by a high growing stock (1215 m 3 ∙ha− 1). This is due to good site quality, prevalence of conifers (84 %) and dominant endogenous processes in recent decades. In all three OG forests, indicators of structural change exhibited progression of European beech over time. Historical evidence revealed the occurrence of warm summers and droughts followed by bark beetle outbreaks in the 1920 s, 1940 s and early 1950 s, which in turn influenced a marked conifer decline. It seems likely that repeated <b>canopy</b> opening <b>released</b> waves of European beech regeneration. These stand structural changes have delayed the rejuvenation of conifers and can help explain the early observations of conifer decline...|$|R

The plots are equally divided between the three developmental stages of virgin forests. The analysis revealed that in the studied area no plant species can be accounted for the differentiation between the developmental stages. Our results indicate that in the conditions of Babia hora two types of cyclical changes of plant species occur: a small and a large cycle of plant communities. The analysis of the influence of developmental stage on the proportion coverage of plant species with the same Ellenberg's indicator value showed that environmental ecological conditions are not affected by the developmental stage of virgin forest.

50|$|Newly created light gaps are avoided {{in a lot}} of {{situations}} by species that would normally replenish them through seed dispersal. However, the aid of the wind for seed dispersal in the light gap has a positive effect on plants, taking them further from the parent plant and decreasing predation. Frugivores such as birds and bats find recently created gaps dangerous because they pose a hazard on their overall well-being. Birds find no place to perch, and bats are more susceptible to predators when they fly in this area. Large monkeys, toucans, and guans perch in the tops of the <b>canopy,</b> and therefore <b>release</b> their seeds under the canopy and as a result, the seeds do not get dispersed where most needed. Wind initiates seed movement into the canopy gap. As the gap matures, it begins to grow trees that bear fruit, and growth of shrubs draw in more animals as they provide better protection from the open canopy above.|$|R
50|$|Like other sirenians, Steller's sea cow was an obligate {{herbivore}} {{and spent}} most of the day feeding, only lifting its head every 4 to 5 minutes for breathing. Kelp was its main food source, making it an algivore. The sea cow likely fed on several species of kelp, which have been identified as: Agarum spp., Alaria praelonga, Halosaccion glandiforme, Laminaria saccharina, Nereocyctis luetkeana and Thalassiophyllum clathrus. Steller's sea cow only fed directly on the soft parts of the kelp, which caused the tougher stem and holdfast to wash up on the shore in heaps. The sea cow may have also fed on seagrass, but the plant was not common enough to support a viable population and could not have been the sea cow's primary food source. Further, the available seagrasses in the sea cow's range (Phyllospadix spp. and Zostera marina) may have grown too deep underwater or been too tough for the animal to consume. Since the sea cow floated, it likely fed on canopy kelp, as it is believed to have only had access to food no deeper than 1 m below the tide. Kelp releases a chemical deterrent to protect it from grazing, but <b>canopy</b> kelp <b>releases</b> a lower concentration of the chemical, allowing the sea cow to graze safely. Steller noted that the sea cow grew thin during the frigid winters, indicating a period of fasting due to low kelp growth. Fossils of Pleistocene Aleutian Island sea cow populations were larger than those from the Commander Islands, indicating that the growth of Commander Island sea cows may have been stunted due to a less favorable habitat and less food than the warmer Aleutian Islands.|$|R
5|$|Banksia oblongifolia {{plants can}} live {{for more than}} 60 years. They respond to bushfire by resprouting from buds located on the large woody lignotuber. Larger lignotubers have the {{greatest}} number of buds, although buds are more densely spaced on smaller lignotubers. A 1988 field study in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park found that shoots grow longer after fire, particularly one within the previous four years, and that new buds grow within six months after a fire. These shoots are able to grow, flower and set seed two to three years after a fire. The woody infructescences also release seeds as their follicles are opened with heat, although a proportion do open spontaneously at other times. One field study in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park found 10% opened in the absence of bushfire, and that seeds germinated, and young plants do grow. Older plants are serotinous, that is, they store large numbers of seed in an aerial seed bank in their <b>canopy</b> that are <b>released</b> after fire. Being relatively heavy, the seeds do not disperse far from the parent plant.|$|R
40|$|We {{assess the}} {{hypothesis}} that rates of nitrogen transformations in the soil are altered upon replacement of native by exotic trees, differing in litter properties. Ailanthus altissima and Robinia pseudoacacia, two common exotic trees naturalized in the Iberian Peninsula, were compared with the native trees Ulmus minor and Fraxinus angustifolia, respectively. Naturally senesced leaves of each species were collected and C:N ratio, N and lignin content assessed. We prepared 64 litter bags per species and left them to decompose, below the canopy {{of the same species}} and below the canopy of the paired species. Dry mass, N concentration and N pool of the remaining litter were assessed after 5 and 7 months. Soil samples were collected three times during the experiment to assess soil moisture, organic matter, pH, potential mineralization rates and mineral N pools. Mineral N availability was assessed three times in the field by using ion-exchange resin-impregnated membranes. Ailanthus litter decomposed faster than Ulmus litter, probably due to the higher toughness of the latter. In spite of its high N content, Robinia litter decomposed slower than Fraxinus one, probably due to its high lignin content. In both cases, litter decomposition was faster below the exotic than the native <b>canopies.</b> The <b>release</b> of N per unit of initial litter mass was higher under both invaded situations (Ailanthus below Ailanthus and Robinia below Robinia) than under the native ones. However, soils collected below native and exotic trees neither differed in potential N mineralization rate nor in mineral N. This may be attributed to a quick plant uptake of released N and/or to a high organic matter accumulation in the soil previous to invasion that can exert a tighter control on soil N transformations than the current exotic litte...|$|R
500|$|The {{response}} of Banksia marginata to fire is variable. In the Gibraltar Range and Sydney regions, plants {{are killed by}} fire and regenerate from seed. They are serotinous, storing their seed in old cones, forming a seedbank in their <b>canopy</b> which is <b>released</b> after bushfire. A field study found that seeds were dispersed short distances (generally [...] or less), with those closest to the parent plant faring the best. In Little Desert National Park in northwestern Victoria and also eastern south Australia, it grows as a low shrub which suckers (shoots growing from lateral roots) after fire. Plants {{do not appear to}} live longer than 25 years; after this time the ageing plants begin to die and are succeeded by younger plants arising from suckers around the parent. A field study in Gippsland found counting the nodes of Banksia marginata plants to be accurate in indicating age within a year up to 21 years since the last fire. There is anecodotal evidence of plants reaching 150 years old in this region. Plant species from communities dependent on fire are thought to self-select to be more flammable; Banksia marginata tested from a dry sclerophyll community in southeastern Tasmania was shown to burn readily, and fire would spread easily through it.|$|R

40|$|Abstract-The {{two studies}} {{presented}} in this paper were completed in southeastern Kentucky and were designed to evaluate acorn production and development of advanced white oak reproduction from fully released white oak (Quercus &a) trees typical of reserve trees in the two age system. Twelve 2 acre 60 - to 90 -year-old white oak dominated stands were randomly assigned 1 of 3 treatments including an uncut treatment, and two cut treatments of 20 fully <b>released</b> <b>canopy</b> trees per acre, and 34 trees per acre. Acorn production from 11 to 15 years and regeneration accumulation, canopy cover and light regimes were monitored 15 years after treatment. Released trees produced significantly (p < 0. 01) more acorns (1, 424 grams per tree per year) compared to unreleased trees (689 grams per tree per year). Highly significant differences (p c 0. 001) were found among treatments for cumulative white oak advanced regeneration density, height and densitometer readings. Strong relationships between densitometer readings and: PPFD; regeneration density; and regeneration height were found (IY=ranging 0. 743 to 0. 974).

40|$|Aim A major {{question}} {{with regard to}} the ecology of temperate rain forests in south-central Chile is how pioneer and shade-tolerant tree species coexist in old-growth forests. We explored the correspondence between tree regeneration dynamics and life-history traits to explain the coexistence of these two functional types in stands apparently representing a non-equilibrium mixture. Location This study was conducted in northern Chiloe Island, Chile (41. 6 degrees S, 73. 9 degrees W) in a temperate coastal rain forest with no evidence of stand disruption by human impact. Methods We assessed stand structure by sampling all stems within two 50 x 20 m and four 5 x 100 m plots. A 600 -m long transect, with 20 uniformly spaced sampling points, was used to quantify seedling and sapling densities, obtain increment cores, and randomly select 10 tree-fall gaps. We used tree-ring analysis to assess establishment periods and to relate the influences of disturbances to the regeneration dynamics of the main canopy species. Results Canopy emergent tree species were the long-lived pioneer Eucryphia cordifolia and the shade-tolerant Aextoxicon punctatum. Shade-tolerant species such as Laureliopsis philippiana and several species of Myrtaceae occupied the main canopy. The stem diameter distribution for E. cordifolia was distinctly unimodal, while for A. punctatum it was multi-modal, with all age classes represented. Myrtaceae accounted for most of the small trees. Most tree seedlings and saplings occurred beneath canopy gaps. Based on tree-ring counts, the largest individuals of A. punctatum and E. cordifolia had minimum ages estimated to be > 350 years and > 286 years, respectively. Shade-tolerant Myrtaceae species and L. philippiana had shorter life spans (< 200 years). Most growth releases, regardless of tree species, were moderate and have occurred continuously since 1750. Main conclusions We suggest that this coastal forest has remained largely free of stand-disrupting disturbances for at least 450 years, without substantial changes in <b>canopy</b> composition. <b>Release</b> patterns are consistent with this hypothesis and suggest that the disturbance regime is dominated by individual tree-fall gaps, with sporadic multiple tree falls. Long life spans, maximum height and differences in shade tolerance provide a basis for understanding the long-term coexistence of pioneer and shade-tolerant tree species in this coastal, old-growth rain forest, despite the rarity of major disturbances...|$|R
40|$|To {{describe}} the historical patterns of natural disturbance regimes in European boreal forests {{we conducted a}} dendroecological study in a primeval old-growth spruce dominated stands and reconstructed the long-term dynamics of canopy disturbances. We treated the radial growth releases of individual sub-canopy trees as the major indicator of sudden openings in the forest <b>canopy.</b> Growth <b>releases</b> were detected by using the formal approach only (strict criteria were applied). The reconstruction of past canopy disturbances was done by GIS-based analysis of spatial information on released trees over the study period. The study area was located in the transitional vegetation zone of the middle and northern taiga, on the watershed of Northern Dvina and Pinega rivers, North-Western Russia. Spatial and temporal characteristics of canopy disturbances were studied within the area of 1. 8 ha along the two transects, 20 x 450 m 2 each. All trees with DBH > 6 cm (dead and alive) and coarse woody debris (DBH > 18 cm) within transects were mapped and described (n = 2126) and all living and recently dead trees were sampled with an increment corer (n = 1678) at the height 40 cm above the root collar. Stands were composed of Picea abies and Betula pendula, mean standing volume was 211 m 3 /ha. Spruce was of multiple ages with pronounced regular peaks (cohorts) in trees age distribution. At least four such cohorts were distinguished and represented peaks in spruce regeneration. No evidence of stand replacing events was found over the 250 (300) -year period that the study covered. The dynamics was likely driven by small and middle-size canopy disturbances, occurring at varying frequencies. A detailed spatial disturbances reconstruction reflecting the last 170 (160) years revealed a disturbance rate of about 4 % yearly mortality. Periodic increases in disturbance rate however {{played a major role}} in forest regeneration. Four such peaks were timed to decades 1850, 1890, 1930 (1920 – for transect 1) and 1980. Disturbance rates at peaking decades were about 60 % and never exceeded 75 % of the canopy area. Surprisingly little difference in disturbance rates was found among forest types with different soil moisture. Though forests with higher soil moisture had slightly lower disturbance intensity and less pronounced regular peaks in disturbance rate over considered time span...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In {{spite of}} very low {{nutrient}} concentrations in its vicinity – both column and pore waters-, the Posidonia oceanica of the Revellata Bay displays high biomass and productivity. We measured the nutrient fluxes from the sediment {{into the water}} enclosed among the leaf shoots ("canopy water") to determine if it is possible source of nutrients for P. oceanica leaves. Results During the summer, the canopy water appears {{to act as a}} nutrient reservoir for the plant. During that period, the canopy water layer displays both a temperature 0. 5 °C cooler than the upper water column, and a much higher nutrient content, as shown in this work using a very simple original technique permitting to sample water with a minimal disturbance of the water column's vertical structure. Despite low nutrient concentrations in pore water, mean net fluxes were measured from the sediment to the canopy water. These fluxes are sufficient to provide 20 % of the mean daily nitrogen and phosphorus requirement of the P. oceanica shoots. Conclusion An internal cycling of nutrients from P. oceanica senescent leaves was previously noted as an efficient strategy to help face low nutrient availability. The present study points out a second strategy which consists in holding back, in the <b>canopy,</b> the nutrients <b>released</b> at the water-sediment interface. This process occurs when long leaves, during poor nutrient periods in the water column, providing, to P. oceanica, the possibility to develop, high biomass, high chlorophyll quantities in low nutrient environment (a Low Nutrients High Chlorophyll system). </p...|$|R
5000|$|The SDV program {{dates back}} to World War II. Initiated by the Office of Strategic Services Maritime Unit (OSS MU). A “submersible canoe” was invented by the Italians during World War I [...] The idea was {{successfully}} applied by the Italian navy (Regia Marina) also early in World War II. The official Italian name for their craft was Siluro a Lenta Corsa (SLC or [...] "Slow-running torpedo"). The vehicle was then copied by the British when they discovered the Italian operations and called it the “Sleeping Beauty”. It was employed by OSS MU during extensive training and exercises, but was never actually deployed for combat operations. The same capability {{was adopted by the}} post-war Underwater Demolition Teams (UDTs) in 1947. The one-man submersible displayed little functional military potential; however, it substantiated and characterized the need for improved and expanded UDT capabilities.After the war, development continued in a garage-shop fashion by various UDT units, and included various [...] "Marks" [...] as the MK V, VI, VII, and XII. Intermediate numbers were assigned to some vehicles that never made it off the shop floor. All were of flooded design. The wet vehicle SDV program (officially named the Swimmer Delivery Vehicle, sometimes erroneously designated as the SEAL Delivery Vehicle after the Swimmer Delivery Vehicle Teams were renamed SEAL Delivery Vehicle Teams) currently centers on the MK VIII MOD 1, was first established in 1975 for use among UDT/SEAL teams. The early MK8 MOD 0 SDVs had a PRC104 UHF ultra high frequency radio for use underwater. The newer model MK8 MOD1 has a dual sliding <b>canopy</b> and quick <b>release</b> hatch.|$|R
40|$|With fire suppression, {{many western}} forests are {{expected}} to have fewer gaps and higher stem density of shade-tolerant species as light competition becomes a more significant influence on stand pattern and composition. We compared species composition, structure, spatial pattern, and environmental factors such as light and soil moisture between two old-growth forests: Pacific Northwest western hemlock/Douglas-fir at the Wind River Canopy Crane Research Facility exhibiting gap-phase replacement and southern Sierra Nevada mixed conifer at the Teakettle Experimental Forest after 135 years without a fire. We hypothesized that fire suppression at Teakettle would create a current tree composition and distribution more like Wind River where light is an important influence on stand dynamics. Wind River has nearly continuous canopy cover and a high foliage volume that severely reduces understory light and stratifies the canopy composition by shade tolerance. Large trees are regularly spaced from 0 to 15 m and shade-tolerant and intolerant species are “repelled. ” In contrast, Teakettle’s canopy cover is discontinuous, foliage volume is one-fifth that of Wind River, and understory light is 15 times higher. Trees at Teakettle are significantly clustered in groups containing a mix of shade-tolerant and -intolerant species, separated by large gaps. Although Teakettle’s gaps have higher moisture and a thinner litter layer than tree groups, regeneration in gaps is scarce. Fire suppression has increased stem density at Teakettle but it has not filled in gaps, stratified the canopy by shade tolerance, or produced a composition consistent with patterns at Wind River. Teakettle’s distinctly clustered stem distribution may result from a minimum canopy cover threshold needed for tree establishment. If high temperatures produced by direct sunlight inhibit stem patterns, traditional stand management that reduces <b>canopy</b> cover to <b>release</b> regeneration should be applied with caution in the southern Sierra Nevada.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of AgronomyWilliam T. SchapaughRecent {{results from}} a genetic gain study have {{illustrated}} the contribution of plant breeding to the improvement in seed yield of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.). The objective {{of this research was}} to characterize the changes in several physiological parameters that have occurred in the released cultivars with improvement of seed yield. Sixty maturity group III and 54 maturity group IV cultivars, released from the 1920 's through 2010, were evaluated in dryland and irrigated environments at Manhattan, KS in 2010 and 2011. Genotypes were planted in four-row plots, 3. 4 m long, spaced 76 cm apart, arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replications. Genotypes were evaluated for canopy temperature, leaf chlorophyll content, pollen germination, leaf chlorophyll fluorescence, leaf antioxidants, and yield components. Canopy temperature measurements were captured between 1000 h and 1400 h using an infrared camera multiple times from R 1 continuing through R 6. Leaf chlorophyll content was measured using a SPAD meter several times from R 1 through R 6. In vitro pollen germination was measured using incubation temperatures of 28 and 34 ° C, beginning at late R 1 through the end of flowering. Leaf chlorophyll fluorescence was measured beginning at R 1 through R 6. Leaf antioxidants were analyzed for total antioxidant capacity and electrolyte leakage by collecting leaves from the top 3 rd to 5 th trifoliate at R 4 and R 6. Yield components were analyzed from a hand harvested 0. 33 m section of one border row. Genotypes differed significantly for canopy temperature, leaf chlorophyll content, pollen germination, and yield components. No significant differences were found for leaf chlorophyll fluorescence or leaf antioxidants. Seed yield increased with year of <b>release.</b> <b>Canopy</b> temperature was negatively correlated and leaf chlorophyll content was positively correlated with year of release in both maturity groups. No significant correlation with year of release was found for in vitro pollen germination or electrolyte leakage. Leaf chlorophyll fluorescence, yield components, and total antioxidant capacity was positively correlated in the maturity group IV genotypes with year of release. Evaluation of these parameters may serve as a basis to select for seed yield, or to assess the abiotic stress tolerance of a genotype...|$|R
