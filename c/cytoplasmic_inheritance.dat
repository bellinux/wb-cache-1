40|$|Abstract Background The {{evolutionary}} {{success of}} Wolbachia bacteria, infections {{of which are}} widespread in invertebrates, is largely attributed to an ability to manipulate host reproduction without imposing substantial fitness costs. Here, we describe a stage-structured model with deterministic immature lifestages and a stochastic adult female lifestage. Simulations were conducted to better understand Wolbachia invasions into uninfected host populations. The model includes conventional Wolbachia parameters (the level of <b>cytoplasmic</b> incompatibility, maternal <b>inheritance,</b> the relative fecundity of infected females, and the initial Wolbachia infection frequency) and a new parameter termed relative larval viability (RLV), which is the survival of infected larvae relative to uninfected larvae. Results The results predict the RLV parameter {{to be the most}} important determinant for Wolbachia invasion and establishment. Specifically, the fitness of infected immature hosts must be close to equal to that of uninfected hosts before population replacement can occur. Furthermore, minute decreases in RLV inhibit the invasion of Wolbachia despite high levels of <b>cytoplasmic</b> incompatibility, maternal <b>inheritance,</b> and low adult fitness costs. Conclusions The model described here takes a novel approach to understanding the spread of Wolbachia through a population with explicit dynamics. By combining a stochastic female adult lifestage and deterministic immature/adult male lifestages, the model predicts that even those Wolbachia infections that cause minor decreases in immature survival are unlikely to invade and spread within the host population. The results are discussed in relation to recent theoretical and empirical studies of natural population replacement events and proposed applied research, which would use Wolbachia as a tool to manipulate insect populations. </p...|$|R
40|$|Two-component signal transduction, {{consisting}} of sensor kinases and response regulators, is the predominant signalling mechanism in bacteria. This signalling system originated in prokaryotes and has {{spread throughout the}} eukaryotic domain of life through endosymbiotic, lateral gene transfer from the bacterial ancestors and early evolutionary precursors of eukaryotic, cytoplasmic, bioenergetic organellesâ€”chloroplasts and mitochondria. Until recently, {{it was thought that}} two-component systems inherited from an ancestral cyanobacterial symbiont are no longer present in chloroplasts. Recent research now shows that two-component systems have survived in chloroplasts as products of both chloroplast and nuclear genes. Comparative genomic analysis of photosynthetic eukaryotes shows a lineage-specific distribution of chloroplast two-component systems. The components and the systems they comprise have homologues in extant cyanobacterial lineages, indicating their ancient cyanobacterial origin. Sequence and functional characteristics of chloroplast two-component systems point to their fundamental role in linking photosynthesis with gene expression. We propose that two-component systems provide a coupling between photosynthesis and gene expression that serves to retain genes in chloroplasts, thus providing the basis of <b>cytoplasmic,</b> non-Mendelian <b>inheritance</b> of plastid-associated characters. We discuss the role of this coupling in the chronobiology of cells and in the dialogue between nuclear and cytoplasmic genetic systems...|$|R
40|$|Inherited {{mutations}} {{are known}} to cause familial cancers. However, the cause of sporadic cancers, which likely represent the majority of cancers, {{is yet to be}} elucidated. Sporadic cancers contain somatic mutations (including oncogenic mutations), however, the origin of these mutations is unclear. An intriguing possibility is that a stable alteration occurs in somatic cells prior to oncogenic mutations and promotes the subsequent accumulation of oncogenic mutations. This review explores the possible role of prions and protein-only inheritance in cancer. Genetic studies using lower eukaryotes, primarily yeast, have identified a large number of proteins as prions that confer dominant phenotypes with <b>cytoplasmic</b> (non-Mendelian) <b>inheritance.</b> Many of these have mammalian functional homologs. The human prion protein (PrP) is known to cause neurodegenerative diseases and has now been found to be up-regulated in multiple cancers. PrP expression in cancer cells contributes to cancer progression and resistance to various cancer therapies. Epigenetic changes in gene expression and hyper-activation of MAP kinase (MAPK) signalling, processes that in lower eukaryotes are affected by prions, play important roles in oncogenesis in humans. Prion phenomena in yeast appear to be influenced by stresses and there i...|$|R

Eight phenotype-positive LB strains showing mortality of male embryos were amplified with rickettsial genus-specific primers from the gene for citrate synthase (CS) and the gene for a 17 -kDa protein and spotted fever group-specific primers from the gene for the 120 -kDa outer membrane protein (ompB). The specificity of amplification was confirmed by Southern hybridization {{and the absence of}} the above-listed gene products in three phenotype-negative LB strains. Restriction polymorphism patterns of three examined amplicons from the CS gene, 17 -kDa-protein gene, and ompB gene were identical among the eight phenotype-positive LB strains and were unique among all known rickettsiae of the spotted fever and typhus groups. Amplified fragments of the CS genes of the AB bacterium, Rickettsia prowazekii Breinl, Rickettsia typhi Wilmington, Rickettsia canada 2678, and Rickettsia conorii 7 (Malish) were sequenced.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Most non-chromosomal {{congenital}} heart defects {{are thought}} to be caused by the interaction of genetic factors involving multiple genes and environmental factors. Families that have several affected members have been reported, however, which suggests that a single autosomal dominant or recessive gene may cause the cardiac defects. A family in which atrioventricular septal defect seemed to be a single gene disorder is reported. OBSERVATIONS [...] A family in which the mother and her two daughters from different fathers had atrioventricular septal defect not associated with trisomy 21 is reported. CONCLUSIONS [...] This family raises the possibility that <b>cytoplasmic</b> or mitochondrial <b>inheritance</b> may be involved in the causation of atrioventricular septal defects. The available data from pedigrees from other cases of familial atrioventricular septal defect do not support this genetic mechanism, but suggest that there is a subgroup without trisomy 21 that has a single gene disorder...|$|R
40|$|AbstractStudies in {{vertebrate}} and invertebrate {{model organisms}} on the molecular basis of {{primordial germ cell}} (PGC) specification have revealed that metazoans can specify their germ line either early in development by maternally transmitted <b>cytoplasmic</b> factors (<b>inheritance),</b> or later in development by signaling factors from neighboring tissues (induction). Regardless of the mode of PGC specification, once animal germ cells are specified, they invariably express a number of highly conserved genes. These include vasa and piwi, which can play essential roles in {{any or all of}} PGC specification, development, or gametogenesis. Although the arthropods are the most speciose animal phylum, to date there have been no functional studies of conserved germ line genes in species of the most basally branching arthropod clade, the chelicerates (which includes spiders, scorpions, and horseshoe crabs). Here we present the first such study by using molecular and functional tools to examine germ line development and the roles of vasa and piwi orthologues in the common house spider Parasteatoda (formerly Achaearanea) tepidariorum. We use transcript and protein expression patterns of Pt-vasa and Pt-piwi to show that primordial germ cells (PGCs) in the spider arise during late embryogenesis. Neither Pt-vasa nor Pt-piwi gene products are localized asymmetrically to any embryonic region before PGCs emerge as paired segmental clusters in opisthosomal segments 2 â€“ 6 at late germ band stages. RNA interference studies reveal that both genes are required maternally for egg laying, mitotic progression in early embryos, and embryonic survival. Our results add to the growing body of evidence that vasa and piwi can play important roles in somatic development, and provide evidence for a previously hypothesized conserved role for vasa in cell cycle progression...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTransposable element (TE) {{activity}} is repressed in the Drosophila germline by Piwi-Interacting RNAs (piRNAs), {{a class of}} small non-coding RNAs. These piRNAs are produced by discrete genomic loci containing TE fragments. In a recent publication, we tested {{for the existence of}} a strict epigenetic induction of piRNA production capacity by a locus in the D. melanogaster genome. We used 2 lines carrying a transgenic 7 -copy tandem cluster (P-lacZ-white) at the same genomic site. This cluster generates in both lines a local heterochromatic sector. One line (T- 1) produces high levels of ovarian piRNAs homologous to the P-lacZ-white transgenes and shows a strong capacity to repress homologous sequences in trans, whereas the other line (BX 2) is devoid of both of these capacities. The properties of these 2 lines are perfectly stable over generations. We have shown that the maternal transmission of a cytoplasm carrying piRNAs from the first line can confer to the inert transgenic locus of the second, a totally de novo capacity to produce high levels of piRNAs as well as the ability to induce homology-dependent silencing in trans. These new properties are stably inherited over generations (n > 50). Furthermore, the converted locus has itself become able to convert an inert transgenic locus via <b>cytoplasmic</b> maternal <b>inheritance.</b> This results in a stable epigenetic conversion process, which can be performed recurrently-a phenomenon termed paramutation and discovered in Maize 60 y ago.

40|$|Species of Gracilaria {{are some}} of the most useful algae in the world for the {{production}} of agar. As a consequence of its economic importance, the genus has been the subject of many studies worldwide. Color variants of Gracilaria birdiae have been found in the natural population on the Brazilian coast, and they have also been isolated from plants cultivated in laboratory. These findings raised new questions regarding intraspecific variation and the prospects of cultivating such variants for their agar production. Therefore, this work aimed to determine the mode of color inheritance for two G. birdiae strains: a greenish-brown strain (gb) found in a natural population and a green strain (gr) which had arisen as a spontaneous mutation in a red plant cultured in the laboratory. The pigment contents of these strains, as well as the red wildtype (rd), were also characterized. Crosses between female and male plants of the same color (rd, gr, or gb) and between different colors were performed. Crosses between plants of the same color showed tetrasporophytic and gametophytic descendents of the parental color. Recessive nuclear inheritance was found in the greenish-brown strain, and <b>cytoplasmic</b> maternal <b>inheritance</b> was found in the green strain; both had lower phycoerythrin and higher concentrations of allophycocyanin and phycocyanin than the wild-type. Chlorophyll a contents were similar among all strains. Taken together, our results contribute to knowledge about the variability of this important red algae. In addition, since greenish-brown and green strains showed stability of color, both could be selected and tested in experimental sea cultivation to evaluate if mutants have advantageous performance when compared with red strain.

The progeny could have functional copies of iojap, but since the chloroplasts come exclusively from the mother in most angiosperms, {{they would have been}} inactivated in the previous generation, and so will give white plants.

To understand the nature of gene action for inheritance of shoot fly resistance, we evaluated 10 parents, 45 F 1 â€™s and their reciprocals in replicated trials during the rainy and postrainy seasons. Genotypes ICSV 700, Phule Anuradha, ICSV 25019, PS 35805, IS 2123, IS 2146 and IS 18551 exhibited resistance to shoot fly damage across seasons.

For small, medium and large lines replicated in two management herds (Rhodes, McNay), variance components and genetic parameters were estimated for cytoplasmic and nuclear genetic effects. Also, a genetic evaluation was conducted for each line {{to determine if}} any genetic change had occurred during the 10 year study. Genetic and permanent environmental trends were reported for weight and height. In a least squares analysis, cytoplasmic lineage effects were important for birth weight (BW) in all size lines and for weaning weight (WW) and total preweaning gain (GAIN) in the small lines. Across herds and size lines, the cytoplasmic lineage variance for WW ranged from 2. 6 to 10. 9 % of the total random variance. Heritabilities estimated from an animal model indicated herd and size line differences. Direct (maternal) heritability estimates for BW at Rhodes were. 62 (. 03) for small,. 67 (. 06) for medium and. 30 (. 11) for large lines. For WW at Rhodes, the direct (maternal) heritability estimates were. 30 (. 29),. 30 (. 14) and. 10 (. 16) for small, medium and large lines. Heritabilities at McNay {{were similar to those}} at Rhodes, except WW maternal genetic estimates at McNay were smaller, reflecting early weaning practices. Results for GAIN were similar to WW. Genetic correlations between direct and maternal effects tended to be more negative in the small lines and more positive in the large lines.

In general, cytoplasmic variance was not important for any trait after accounting for genetic relationships, which contrasted with the results from the least squares study. A genetic evaluation of weight and height (HH) indicated that little genetic change had occurred during the project. At Rhodes, direct genetic trend was significant for WW and GAIN in the small and medium lines and for HH in the small and large lines. Selection for HH at Rhodes differentiated the large and small lines by 1. 00 cm. Direct trend at McNay was significant for WW, but not for HH.

The estimation of pollen migration should therefore be facilitated with paternal <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>inheritance</b> relative to the case of maternal <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>inheritance.</b> These basic conclusions hold whether the population is censused as seeds or as adults, but with simultaneous pollen and seed migration, the relationship between census time and the ability to detect nonrandom cytonuclear associations is complex.

We found no significant Z-linked genetic variance in great tit plumage coloration, while zebra finch beak coloration exhibited significant W linkage and <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>inheritance.</b> Our results support <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>inheritance</b> of color in the zebra finch, a trait based on endogenously metabolized carotenoids, and demonstrate the potential for nonautosomal sources to account for a considerable share of genetic variation in coloration. Although often overlooked, such nonautosomal genetic variation exhibits sex-dependent patterns of inheritance and potentially influences the evolution of sexual dichromatism...|$|E

We measured the rate of spread and the effect of host population size using different initial frequencies of infection with a cytoplasmic factor that mediates reproductive incompatibility. There were two experiments, in one the infected and uninfected lines were from the same genetic strain, b-Yugoslavia. In the other, the infected line was from the ``high cannibalism'' bIV strain and the uninfected line from the ``low cannibalism'' bI strain. We estimate that the fitness ratio of infected to uninfected in b-Yugoslavia is 0. 63 and the observed rate of spread for this strain corresponds to a model of <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>inheritance</b> that takes into account the productivity differences between the infected and cured lines. In the bI-bIV experiment, because the uninfected and infected lines are from different genetic strains, we cannot partiti{{on the effects of}} the cytoplasmic factor from other factors. The rate of spread in the bI-bIV experiment is faster in males and slower in females than predicted from a model of <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>inheritance.</b> In both experiments, productivity varies with initial infection frequency; however, the relationship is not explained by a simple model that predicts lower population size at intermediate infection frequencies...|$|E
40|$|The {{classical}} maize mutant iojap (Iodent japonica) has variegated {{green and}} white leaves. Green sectors have cells with normal chloroplasts whereas white sectors have cells where plastids fail to differentiate. These mutant plastids, when transmitted through the female gametophyte, do not recover {{in the presence of}} wild type Iojap. We cloned the Ij locus, and we have investigated the mechanism of epigenetic inheritance and phenotypic expression. More recently, a modifier of this type of variegation, ''Inhibitor of striate'', has also been cloned. Both the iojap and inhibitor of striate proteins have homologs in bacteria and are members of ancient conserved families found in multiple species. These tools can be used to address fundamental questions of inheritance and variegation associated with this classical conundrum of maize genetics. Since the work of Rhoades there has been considerable speculation concerning the nature of the Iojap gene product, the origin of leaf variegation and the mechanism behind the material inheritance of defective plastids. This has made Iojap a textbook paradigm for <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>inheritance</b> and nuclear-organellar interaction for almost 50 years. Cloning of the Iojap gene in maize, and homologs in other plants and bacteria, provides a new means to address the origin of heteroplastidity, variegation and <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>inheritance</b> in higher plants...|$|E
40|$|Mitochondria are {{normally}} transmitted through the maternal (protoperithecial) parent. <b>Cytoplasmic</b> <b>inheritance</b> {{can thus be}} distinguished from mendelian inheritance of chromosomal genes by making reciprocal crosses and showing that the trait in question is not transmitted when it {{is present in the}} male (fertilizing) parent. Mutant mitochondria, and mitochondrial plasmids, are also capable of vegetative transmission when heterokaryons are formed. The first mitochondrial mutants in Neurospora (Mitchell and Mitchell 1952, Mitchell et al. 1953) involved respiratory defects resulting from mitochondrial deletions. Individual mitochondrial genes were subsequently identified that involved either the respirator...|$|E
40|$|Posterior polar plasm of the Drosophila egg {{has been}} shown to {{function}} autonomously in germ cell determination after transplantation to either the anterior or mid-ventral region of the early embryo. By means of similar transplantations, we have tested the ability of polar plasm of Drosophila immigrans to induce the formation of pole cells in a Drosophila melanogaster embryo. After the transplantation of polar plasm, "hybrid" pole cells were found in which both pole cell-specific organelles, the polar granules and nuclear body, were structurally similar to those characteristic of the transplanted cytoplasm. In order to determine whether these hybrid cells can function as germ cell precursors, these cells were transplanted to the posterior tip of genetically marked embryos. Approximately 5 % of the flies obtained from embryos receiving potential pole cells produce offspring derived from the induced pole cells. This result demonstrates that polar plasm can function in interspecific species combinations and indicates that the molecular mechanisms of germ cell determination are conservative in evolution. Finally, in order to test whether there is any evidence for <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>inheritance</b> of polar granules, embryos derived from hybrid pole cells were examined for their polar granule morphology. The fine structure of the granules conformed to that of the nucleus. Thus, no evidence was found for the <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>inheritance</b> of these particular organelles...|$|E
