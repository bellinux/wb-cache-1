5|$|To {{visually}} {{enhance the}} size of this set, the camera was equipped with a 40mm Panavision wide-angle lens and mounted {{at the opposite end of}} the stage, giving Crosby the ability to frame the scenes in his <b>camera</b> <b>with</b> extra space at the bottom and at either side. These areas were filled in later by printing-in process extensions of the set, doubling its size onscreen.|$|E
50|$|While {{mobile phones}} <b>with</b> <b>cameras</b> {{have taken over}} the lion's share of the point and shoot and compact camera market, more {{advanced}} mirrorless <b>cameras</b> <b>with</b> a non-interchangeable prime lens are still being marketed. However, even more useful and common are today mirrorless <b>cameras</b> <b>with</b> a non-interchangeable zoom lens, while the big category {{is likely to become}} mirrorless system <b>cameras</b> <b>with</b> interchangeable lenses. An interesting trend that has been noticed by industry experts is that while casual users may prefer a pocket size <b>camera,</b> sometimes <b>with</b> a collapsible or pancake lens, professional users demand a more substantial <b>camera</b> grip <b>with</b> good balance and comfortable ergonomics plus a battery for all day use, which has led to manufacturers making new, professional mirrorless system cameras slightly larger than their compact siblings.|$|R
5000|$|The 42mm flange focal {{distance}} of the FD mount is shorter than that of most other lens mounts. Therefore, some lenses from other period <b>cameras</b> <b>with</b> longer flange {{focal distance}} can be mounted on Canon FD-mount <b>cameras</b> <b>with</b> appropriate adapters and still retain infinity focus. FD lenses {{can be adapted to}} other <b>cameras</b> <b>with</b> longer flange focal distances, though the lenses cannot focus to infinity unless the adapter contains an optical correction element which may compromise image quality, as it {{is not part of the}} original FD lens optical design.|$|R

5|$|Unusually in Japan, where photographers tend to join or form groups, Kikai {{has never}} been in any group, preferring to work by himself. When not setting out to take photographs, Kikai does not carry a <b>camera</b> <b>with</b> him. He leaves photographing his own family to his wife Noriko, and it is she who has the camera if they go on a trip together.|$|E
5|$|According to Peter Freuchen, {{the scene}} in which the wolf attacks Mala is real. Freuchen says that Mala, armed with {{a rock and a}} pistol beneath his fur jacket, spent three afternoons trying to lure a wolf into attacking him. A rifleman and a cinematographer using a <b>camera</b> <b>with</b> a {{telephoto}} lens followed at a distance. The wolf attack was filmed from far away, with the rifleman ready to shoot the wolf in case Mala was unable to kill it. As shown in film, Mala was able to kill the wolf without using his pistol or relying on the rifleman, and was not injured in the attack.|$|E
5|$|La tragedia del silencio {{was shot}} in {{temporary}} studios {{in the house of}} a priest named Moreira, which is now the location of the Jorge-Eliécer-Gaitán theatre. Initially, the film was shot with a Pathé <b>camera</b> <b>with</b> a 45mm lens, but later a 35mm Kodak Ektachrome was used. The chemicals used for the production of the film were purchased from Óptica Alemana, a company located in Bogotá founded in 1914 by Ernesto Schmidt Mumm. The photographic print was manufactured by the scientific section of airline SCADTA.|$|E

50|$|Many {{photographic}} devices use {{a form of}} strip photography due {{to the use of}} {{a rolling}} shutter for engineering reasons, and exhibit similar effects. This is common both on cheaper <b>cameras</b> <b>with</b> an electronic shutter (more sophisticated electronic shutters are global, not rolling), as well as <b>cameras</b> <b>with</b> mechanical focal-plane shutters.|$|R

5|$|The G2's audio {{hardware}} and software is optimized to support 24-bit/192 kHz audio; during LG's press event, ringtones recorded by the Vienna Boys' Choir (which are also bundled with the device) were used to demonstrate the high quality audio from its internal speaker. The G2 also includes a 13-megapixel rear-facing <b>camera</b> <b>with</b> optical image stabilization, and an infrared emitter which allows it {{to serve as a}} universal remote with the accompanying QuickRemote app.|$|E
5|$|The Texas Chain Saw Massacre {{was mainly}} shot using an Eclair NPR 16mm <b>camera</b> <b>with</b> fine-grain, {{low-speed}} film that required {{four times more}} light than modern digital cameras. Most of the filming {{took place in the}} farmhouse, which was filled with furniture constructed from animal bones and a latex material used as upholstery to give the appearance of human skin. The house was not cooled, and there was little ventilation. The crew covered its walls with drops of animal blood obtained from a local slaughterhouse. Art director Robert A. Burns drove around the countryside and collected the remains of cattle and other animals in various stages of decomposition, with which he littered the floors of the house.|$|E
5|$|The {{effort to}} develop a lighter, quieter <b>camera</b> <b>with</b> a reflex {{viewfinder}} led {{to the introduction of}} the Panavision Silent Reflex (PSR) in 1967. The camera could provide a shutter angle of up to 200 degrees. Many refinements were made to the PSR during the first few years after its introduction, and it soon {{became one of the most}} popular studio cameras in the world. Panavision also began manufacturing spherical lenses for 1.85:1 photography, garnering a significant share of the market.|$|E

5|$|The {{scene where}} Forrest spots Jenny at a peace rally at the Lincoln Memorial and Reflecting Pool in Washington, D.C., {{required}} visual effects {{to create the}} large crowd of people. Over two days of filming, approximately 1,500 extras were used. At each successive take, the extras were rearranged and moved into a different quadrant away from the <b>camera.</b> <b>With</b> the help of computers, the extras were multiplied to create a crowd of several hundred thousand people.|$|E
5|$|Waldman was {{the head}} of Group TR-6 (Airborne Measurements) for the Trinity nuclear test in July 1945. He {{developed}} microphones that were dropped by parachute to measure the effect of the blast. He was then assigned to Project Alberta, the part of the Manhattan Project that oversaw the preparation of facilities to test and deploy nuclear weapons, and support their use during the actual missions. As such, he participated in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, as a camera operator on the observation aircraft. He was equipped with a special high-speed Fastax movie <b>camera</b> <b>with</b> six seconds of film in order to record the blast. Unfortunately, Waldman forgot to open the camera shutter, and no film was exposed.|$|E
5|$|While a great {{solution}} for the actors' performances the technique presented enormous VFX challenges: relighting shots captured in a tall white tube to match the sky over the Bolivian desert, and the impossibility of filming medium to wide shots of the actors. An array of eight Dalsa Origin cameras (supported by seven HD cameras and a 35mm hand-held camera, all running in sync) was {{used to create a}} virtual <b>camera</b> <b>with</b> which to shoot the actors floating in the simulator. Ged Wright and his team at Double Negative developed a method to use the data from these cameras that allowed these real performances to be placed in a synthetic environment as seen by a synthetic camera.|$|E

5|$|All of the film's {{special effect}} {{sequences}} were filmed in <b>camera,</b> <b>with</b> no use of post production effects. In several scenes of Jacob's Ladder, Lyne used a body horror technique {{in which an}} actor is recorded waving his head around at a low frame rate, resulting in horrifically fast motion when played back. In the Special Edition's commentary track, Lyne said he {{was inspired by the}} art of the painter Francis Bacon when developing the effect. In his screenplay, Rubin used traditional imagery of demons and hell. However, Lyne decided to use images similar to thalidomide deformities to achieve a greater shock effect. After many heated arguments, Lyne managed to convert Rubin to his vision. Lyne and Rubin used the works of the artist H. R. Giger and the photographers Diane Arbus and Joel-Peter Witkin for inspiration; another influence came from the Brothers Quay's 1986 stop motion short film Street of Crocodiles.|$|E
5|$|Birdy was {{the first}} feature film to be {{partially}} shot with the Skycam, a computer-controlled, cable-suspended camera system created by Garrett Brown, inventor of the Steadicam. The Skycam had 100-foot high posts with four hanging wires controlled by a computer, and a lightweight Panavision <b>camera</b> <b>with</b> 200 feet of film hung {{at the center of}} the wires. The filmmakers intended to use the Skycam to fully depict Birdy's point of view during a fantasy sequence in which he imagines himself flying. However, they encountered difficulties with the Skycam, which would often malfunction. Although the Skycam proved successful on its first take, Parker insisted that the filmed footage be shot more rapidly. However, the camera system malfunctioned during its second take, after capturing 40 seconds of footage. This resulted in the camera operators shooting the remainder of the sequence with a Steadicam mounted on top of an improvised camera dolly.|$|E
5|$|The HTC One (codenamed and retroactively called M7) is a touchscreen-based Android {{smartphone}} designed, developed, {{and manufactured}} by HTC. The smartphone was unveiled on 19 February 2013 at press events in New York City and London and is HTC’s seventh flagship smartphone. It is {{the successor to}} the company’s 2012 flagship model, the One X—which was critically acclaimed, but commercially unsuccessful {{due in part to}} insufficient marketing efforts. To make the device stand out among its competition, the HTC One was developed with a major emphasis on unique hardware and software features; which included a unibody aluminum frame, a 1080p full-HD display, dual front-facing stereo speakers, a <b>camera</b> <b>with</b> a custom image sensor and the ability to automatically generate montages of media, an updated version of HTC’s Sense user experience, BlinkFeed—an aggregator of news and social network content, and an electronic program guide app with the ability to serve as a universal remote via an IR blaster located in the device’s power button.|$|E

5|$|The Kinetoscope is {{an early}} motion picture {{exhibition}} device. The Kinetoscope was designed for films to be viewed by one individual at a time through a peephole viewer window {{at the top of}} the device. The Kinetoscope was not a movie projector, but introduced the basic approach that would become the standard for all cinematic projection before the advent of video, by creating the illusion of movement by conveying a strip of perforated film bearing sequential images over a light source with a high-speed shutter. A process using roll film first described in a patent application submitted in France and the U.S. by French inventor Louis Le Prince, the concept was also used by U.S. inventor Thomas Edison in 1889, and subsequently developed by his employee William Kennedy Laurie Dickson between 1889 and 1892. Dickson and his team at the Edison lab also devised the Kinetograph, an innovative motion picture <b>camera</b> <b>with</b> rapid intermittent, or stop-and-go, film movement, to photograph movies for in-house experiments and, eventually, commercial Kinetoscope presentations.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} shot over {{eighteen}} days in April 2005. It was filmed {{on location in}} Echo Park inside Glatzer and Westmoreland's house and in three houses on their block that their neighbors allowed them to use for little or no money. Many of Glatzer and Westmoreland's Echo Park neighbors also stood in as extras. Due to California's child labor laws, they could only film with the underage cast members for six hours a day, so cinematographer Eric Steelberg used a hand-held <b>camera</b> <b>with</b> few accessories to maximize the time they could spend filming. Steelberg filmed the project in high-definition video format, which was converted to film during post-production. The film's soundtrack included reggaeton songs as well as music composed by Westmoreland's brother as a favor since the filmmakers could afford little else. Robin Katz finished editing the film in August 2005.|$|E
5|$|The {{second major}} {{instrument}} was the MKF-6M multispectral camera, which carried out Earth-resources observations. An improved {{form of a}} camera first tested on Soyuz 22, the camera captured an area of 165220kilometres with each image, down to a resolution of 20metres. Each image was captured simultaneously in six bands in 1200-frame cassettes, which required regular replacement due to the fogging effects of radiation. Salyut 6 also featured a KATE-140 stereoscopic topographic mapping <b>camera</b> <b>with</b> a focal length of 140millimetres, which captured images of 450450kilometres with a resolution of 50metres in the visible and infrared spectra, which could be operated either remotely or by the resident crews. The photographic capabilities of the station were, therefore, extensive, and the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture had planted a number of specifically selected crops at test sites to examine {{the capabilities of the}} cameras.|$|E
30|$|Gamma <b>cameras</b> <b>with</b> digital {{solid-state}} {{cadmium zinc telluride}} (CZT) {{detectors and}} tungsten collimators {{have been reported to}} provide improved images when compared to those produced by conventional analog <b>cameras,</b> fitted <b>with</b> thallium-doped sodium iodide (NaI [Tl]) detectors and lead collimators [1, 2]. In particular, dedicated cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) <b>cameras</b> <b>with</b> CZT detectors have been commercially available for over a decade, and the published data regarding their potential superiority over conventional gamma cameras is rapidly accumulating [1 – 10].|$|R
50|$|Interchangeable-lens <b>cameras</b> <b>with</b> {{a central}} shutter within the lens body require that each lens has a shutter built into it. In {{practice}} most <b>cameras</b> <b>with</b> interchangeable lenses use a single {{focal plane shutter}} in the camera body for all lenses, while <b>cameras</b> <b>with</b> a fixed lens use a central shutter. Many medium-format and most large-format cameras, however, have interchangeable lenses each fitted with a central shutter. A few interchangeable-lens cameras have a behind-the-lens leaf shutter. Large-format press cameras often had a focal-plane shutter. Some had both a focal-plane shutter (for lens interchangeability) and a lens with central shutter (for flash synchronisation); one shutter would be locked open.|$|R
