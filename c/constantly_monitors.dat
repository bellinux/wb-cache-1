25|$|BITS {{attempts}} {{to use only}} spare bandwidth. For example, when applications use 80% of the available bandwidth, BITS will use only the remaining 20%. BITS <b>constantly</b> <b>monitors</b> network traffic for any increase or decrease in network traffic and throttles its own transfers to ensure that other foreground applications (such as a web browser) get the bandwidth they need.|$|E
25|$|A more {{advanced}} {{way for a}} robot to walk is by using a dynamic balancing algorithm, which is potentially more robust than the Zero Moment Point technique, as it <b>constantly</b> <b>monitors</b> the robot's motion, and places the feet {{in order to maintain}} stability. This technique was recently demonstrated by Anybots' Dexter Robot, which is so stable, it can even jump. Another example is the TU Delft Flame.|$|E
25|$|Single-threaded {{microprocessors}} today waste many cycles {{while waiting}} to access memory, considerably limiting system performance. The use of multi-threading masks {{the effect of}} memory latency by increasing processor utilization. As one thread stalls, additional threads are instantly fed into the pipeline and executed, resulting in a significant gain in application throughput. Users can allocate dedicated processing bandwidth to real-time tasks resulting in a guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS). MIPSâ€™ MT technology <b>constantly</b> <b>monitors</b> the progress of threads and dynamically takes corrective actions to meet or exceed the real-time requirements. A processor pipeline can achieve 80-90% utilization by switching threads during data-dependent stalls or cache misses. All of this leads to an improved mobile device user experience, as responsiveness is greatly increased.|$|E

25|$|Typically ABS {{includes}} a central {{electronic control unit}} (ECU), four wheel speed sensors, {{and at least two}} hydraulic valves within the brake hydraulics. The ECU <b>constantly</b> <b>monitors</b> the rotational speed of each wheel; if it detects the wheel rotating significantly slower than the speed of the vehicle, a condition indicative of impending wheel lock, it actuates the valves to reduce hydraulic pressure to the brake at the affected wheel, thus reducing the braking force on that wheel; the wheel then turns faster. Conversely, if the ECU detects a wheel turning significantly faster than the others, brake hydraulic pressure to the wheel is increased so the braking force is reapplied, slowing down the wheel. This process is repeated continuously and can be detected by the driver via brake pedal pulsation. Some anti-lock systems can apply or release braking pressure 15 times per second. Because of this, the wheels of cars equipped with ABS are practically impossible to lock even during panic braking in extreme conditions.|$|E

2500|$|Gordon wears {{a special}} {{full-body}} hazmat suit, {{known as the}} Hazardous Environment Suit (or HEV Suit), during combat. The suit is {{designed to protect the}} user from radiation, energy discharges, and blunt trauma during the handling of hazardous materials. The suit's main feature is its [...] "high-impact reactive armor", an electrically powered armor system that, when charged, absorbs two-thirds of the damage that Gordon would ordinarily suffer. A fully charged suit can survive several dozen hits from small arms and even one direct hit from an RPG. The suit can be charged by various means, and has its own oxygen supply and medical injectors, such as morphine and a neurotoxin antidote. It comes with a built-in flashlight, a radio, various tracking devices, a compass, and a Geiger counter. The suit contains an on-board computer system that <b>constantly</b> <b>monitors</b> the user's health and vital signs, and reacts to any changes in the user's condition. It also projects a heads-up display (HUD) which displays Gordon's health and suit charge level, remaining ammunition, and a crosshair.|$|E
2500|$|Following their post-sleep period, {{the crews}} {{set to work}} {{preparing}} for the first spacewalk of the mission. Stefanyshyn-Piper and Bowen were suited up and in the airlock ahead of schedule, and the EVA started at 18:09 UTC, with Piper becoming the first female Lead Spacewalker. While Piper was preparing to begin work on the SARJ, she noticed {{a significant amount of}} grease in her tool bag, [...] "I think we had a grease gun explode in the large bag, because there's grease in the bag," [...] Piper reported to Kimbrough, who was working inside the shuttle to help coordinate the EVA. Mission Control managers instructed Piper to clean up the grease using a dry wipe, and while she was doing the cleanup, one of the crew lock bags floated away. [...] "I guess one of my crew lock bags was not transferred and it's loose," [...] Piper told Kimbrough. The bag floated aft and starboard of the station, and did not pose a risk to the station or orbiter. After taking an inventory of the items inside the lost bag, managers on the ground determined that Bowen had all those items in his bag, and the two could share equipment. While it extended the EVA duration slightly, the major objectives were not changed, and all EVA tasks were accomplished. The estimated value of the lost tool bag was US$100,000. An amateur astronomer later observed the tool bag as it orbited the Earth prior to re-entering. It {{was not the first time}} that equipment had got away from spacewalkers, items lost in the past include tools, nuts and bolts, glue guns, cameras, cloths, and even a robotic arm.
