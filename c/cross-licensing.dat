5|$|While Bembo Book is {{considered}} the superior digitisation, the original continues to offer the advantages of two extra weights (semi- and extra-bold) and infant styles with simplified a and g characters resembling handwriting; its lighter appearance may also be of use on printing equipment with greater ink spread. <b>Cross-licensing</b> has meant that it is sold by a range of vendors, often at very low prices. As an example of this, Fontsite obtained the rights to resell a derivative of the original digitisation, using the alternative name Borgia and Bergamo, upgrading it by additional OpenType features such as small capitals and historical alternative characters. Neither version includes digitisations of the larger size versions of Bembo, which had a more delicate and elegant design.|$|E
5|$|Since 1990, Burger King has {{continued}} using Coca-Cola as its beverage supplier, renewing its contract in several times. The Coca-Cola contract {{is not without}} its problems; the 1999 contract called for the Coca-Cola branded Icee products to be made a permanent menu item in all American locations. After the rollout, it was discovered that Coca-Cola employees had faked product test information to bolster prospective sales numbers in an effort to entice franchisees to enroll in a summertime advertising push. Several Coke employees were terminated, and Coca-Cola changed the in-store promotional materials to emphasize the Icee name. The 2003 contract officially extended {{the relationship between the two}} companies so that Coca-Cola was the exclusive supplier of soft drinks for the company. Before this, individual international franchises would negotiate their own contracts with their company of choice. The 2003 contract gave Coca-Cola new access to the 3,000 operating or planned restaurants on the Asia-Pacific rim, in Europe, and in South and Central America. The purchase of Burger King by 3G Capital lead to a change in the beverage contract for the Caribbean and Latin America markets. 3G, which owns AmBev and is the producer and distributor of PepsiCo products in the region, started <b>cross-licensing</b> between its two companies in April 2011 and switched to Pepsi in these markets.|$|E
25|$|The {{only major}} {{competitor}} in the x86 processor market is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), with which Intel has had full <b>cross-licensing</b> agreements since 1976: each partner {{can use the}} other's patented technological innovations without charge after a certain time. However, the <b>cross-licensing</b> agreement is canceled {{in the event of}} an AMD bankruptcy or takeover.|$|E
50|$|Other non-patent {{intellectual}} property such as copyright and trademark {{can also be}} <b>cross-licensed.</b> For example, a literary work and an anthology that includes that literary work may be <b>cross-licensed</b> between two publishers.

5000|$|The dissent {{argued that}} the {{licenses}} in this case were [...] "the only reasonable means for releasing to the public the benefits intended for the public by the patent laws," [...] and this [...] "cross-license between mutually deadlocked complementary patents is, per se, a desirable procedure." [...] In fact, the dissent observed, the price-fixing license in the General Electric case was a <b>cross-license</b> that [...] "contained agreements even more restrictive than the price protection provisions of the <b>cross-licenses</b> {{involved in the case}} at bar." [...] The dissent concluded that there was [...] "neither adequate reason nor authority for overruling" [...] the General Electriuc case or for distinguishing it.|$|R

25|$|Following {{years of}} {{industry}} complaints that the <b>cross-licensing</b> agreements between RCA, GE and Westinghouse had in effect created spheres-of-influence for the participating companies, resulting in illegal monopolies, in 1930 the U.S. Department of Justice brought antitrust {{charges against the}} three companies. In 1932 they accepted a consent agreement which removed the restrictions established by the <b>cross-licensing</b> agreements, and also provided that RCA would become a fully independent company. As a result, GE and Westinghouse gave up their ownership interests in RCA, while RCA was allowed to keep its factories. In order to give RCA a chance to establish itself, GE and Westinghouse were required to refrain from competing in the radio business {{for the next two}} and one-half years.|$|E
25|$|The General Electric Company began {{developing}} three-phase induction motors in 1891. By 1896, General Electric and Westinghouse {{signed a}} <b>cross-licensing</b> agreement for the bar-winding-rotor design, later called the squirrel-cage rotor.

25|$|Intel {{had created}} the first {{microprocessor}}, its 4-bit 4004, in 1971. By 1975, AMD entered the microprocessor market with the Am9080, a reverse-engineered clone of the Intel 8080, and the Am2900 bit-slice microprocessor family. When Intel began installing microcode in its microprocessors in 1976, it entered into a <b>cross-licensing</b> agreement with AMD, granting AMD a copyright license to the microcode in its microprocessors and peripherals, effective October 1976.|$|E
25|$|RCA quickly {{moved to}} expand its {{broadcasting}} activities. In the fall of 1921 it set up its first fulltme broadcasting station, WDY, at the Roselle Park, New Jersey company plant. By 1923 RCA was operating three stations—WJZ (now WABC) and WJY in New York City, and WRC (now WTEM) in Washington, D.C. A restriction imposed by AT's interpretation of the patent <b>cross-licensing</b> agreements required that the RCA stations remain commercial free, and they were financed by profits from radio equipment sales.|$|E
25|$|As of its {{founding}} RCA {{was the largest}} radio communications firm in the United States. However, American Marconi had been falling behind industry advances, particularly in vacuum tube technology, and GE needed access to additional patents before its new subsidiary could be fully competitive. The result {{was a series of}} negotiations and a complicated set of <b>cross-licensing</b> agreements between various companies. On July 1, 1920, an agreement was made with the American Telephone & Telegraph Company (AT), which purchased 500,000 shares of RCA, although it would divest these shares in early 1923. The United Fruit Company held a small portfolio of radio patents, and signed two agreements in 1921. GE's traditional electric company rival, the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Corporation, had also purchased rights to some critical patents, including one for heterodyne receiving originally issued to Reginald Fessenden, plus regenerative circuit and superheterodyne receiver patents issued to Edwin Armstrong. Westinghouse was able to use this to negotiate a <b>cross-licensing</b> agreement, effective July 1, 1921, that included a concession that 40% of RCA's equipment purchases would be from Westinghouse. Following these transactions, GE owned 30.1% of RCA's stock, Westinghouse 20.6%, AT 10.3%, and United Fruit 4.1%, with the remaining 34.9% owned by individual shareholders.|$|E
5000|$|The Federal Trade Commission {{found that}} the <b>cross-license,</b> {{combined}} {{with the fact that}} Pfizer had withheld information that it knew or should have known was relevant to the patentability of tetracycline, constituted an attempt by Pfizer and American Cyanamid to share in an unlawful monopoly. [...] Ultimately, the government lost.|$|R

25|$|The Japanese Patent Office {{granted a}} patent in June 1978 to Texas Instruments (TI) based on US patent 3819921, {{notwithstanding}} objections from 12 Japanese calculator manufacturers. This gave TI {{the right to}} claim royalties retroactively to the original publication of the Japanese patent application in August 1974. A TI spokesman {{said that it would}} actively seek what was due, either in cash or technology <b>cross-licensing</b> agreements. 19 other countries, including the United Kingdom, had already granted a similar patent to Texas Instruments. – New Scientist, 17 August 1978 p455, and Practical Electronics (British publication), October 1978 p1094.|$|E
25|$|These ideas {{could not}} be {{implemented}} by the industry in the early 1950s, but a breakthrough came in late 1958. Three people from three U.S. companies solved three fundamental problems that hindered the production of integrated circuits. Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments patented the principle of integration, created the first prototype ICs and commercialized them. Kurt Lehovec of Sprague Electric Company invented a way to electrically isolate components on a semiconductor crystal. Robert Noyce of Fairchild Semiconductor invented a way to connect the IC components (aluminium metallization) and proposed an improved version of insulation based on the planar technology by Jean Hoerni. On September 27, 1960, using the ideas of Noyce and Hoerni, a group of Jay Last's at Fairchild Semiconductor created the first operational semiconductor IC. Texas Instruments, which held the patent for Kilby's invention, started a patent war, which was settled in 1966 by the agreement on <b>cross-licensing.</b>|$|E
25|$|Texas Instruments v. Fairchild: In {{their legal}} wars, Texas Instruments {{focused on their}} largest and most technologically {{advanced}} competitor, Fairchild Semiconductor. Their cases hindered not the production at Fairchild, but the sale of licenses for their technologies. By 1965, the planar technology of Fairchild became the industry standard, but the license to patents of Hoerni and Noyce was purchased by less than ten manufacturers, {{and there were no}} mechanisms to pursue unlicensed production. Similarly, the key patents of Kilby were bringing no income to Texas Instruments. In 1964, the patent arbitration awarded Texas Instruments the rights to four of the five key provisions of the contested patents, but both companies appealed the decision. The litigation could continue for years, if not the defeat of Texas Instruments in the dispute with Sprague in April 1966. Texas Instruments realized that they could not claim priority for the whole set of key IC patents, and lost interest in the patent war. In the summer of 1966, Texas Instruments and Fairchild agreed on the mutual recognition of patents and <b>cross-licensing</b> of key patents; in 1967 they were joined by Sprague.|$|E

50|$|In patent law, {{a patent}} pool is a {{consortium}} {{of at least two}} companies agreeing to <b>cross-license</b> patents relating to a particular technology. The creation of a patent pool can save patentees and licensees time and money, and, in case of blocking patents, it may also be the only reasonable method for making the invention available to the public. Competition law issues are usually important when a large consortium is formed.|$|R
500|$|A {{large number}} of {{compilation}} albums have been released over the years, usually limited to the group's pre-1966 catalogue. [...] Attempts at full career retrospectives were hampered by <b>cross-licensing</b> problems. [...] Yardbirds' recordings from different periods have different owners (corresponding to the tenures of their three main producers), which {{proved to be an}} obstacle. Ultimate! is the first official compilation to feature songs from all four recording lineups of the Yardbirds – including those with guitarists Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page, and the dual lead lineup with Beck and Page. [...] The album was released to favourable reviews, with the critics describing it as the most comprehensive, but perhaps overinclusive, collection of the group's material.|$|E
500|$|In October 2009, Nokia Corporation sued Apple for Apple's {{infringement}} of Nokia's patents {{relating to}} wireless technology; Apple countersued Nokia in December 2009. The two companies engaged in nearly two-years of litigation and both parties amended their claims multiple {{times and in}} multiple courts before finally settling in June 2011. For an undisclosed amount of cash and future ongoing iPhone royalties to be paid by Apple, Nokia agreed to settle, with Apple's royalty payments retroactively back-payable to the iPhone's introduction in 2007, but with no broad <b>cross-licensing</b> agreement made between the companies. Apple only agreed to cross-license some patents to Nokia.

500|$|In January 1914, a U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals {{upheld the}} verdict against the Curtiss company, which {{continued}} to avoid penalties through legal tactics. Orville apparently felt vindicated by the decision, {{and much to}} the frustration of company executives, he did not push vigorously for further legal action to ensure a manufacturing monopoly. In fact, {{he was planning to}} sell the company and departed in 1915. In 1917, with World War I underway, the U.S. government pressured the industry to form a <b>cross-licensing</b> organization, the Manufacturers Aircraft Association, to which member companies paid a blanket fee for the use of aviation patents, including the original and subsequent Wright patents. The Wright-Martin company (successor to the Wright company) and the Curtiss company (which held a number of its own patents) each received a $2million payment. The [...] "patent war" [...] ended, although side issues lingered in the courts until the 1920s. In a twist of irony, the Wright Aeronautical Corporation (another successor) and the Curtiss Aeroplane company merged in 1929 to form the Curtiss-Wright Corporation, which remains in business today producing high-tech components for the aerospace industry.|$|E
