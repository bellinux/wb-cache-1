Clone, location (farms) effects and GxE interactions were highly significant for both traits. It was observed that using 10 trees per clone per location resulted in similar expected genetic gain as that obtained using 20 trees, for both traits studied. Grouping locations by their geographic proximity might not be a good strategy for clone recommendations. Soil factors are more important than geographical distance and climate factors in causing genotype-by-environment interaction for early yield.

In this study, we investigated the feasibility of using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy for rapid assessment of wood chemical traits in a large sample of Populus nigra L. individuals evaluated in <b>clonal</b> <b>trials</b> at two contrasting sites. Spectra were acquired from 5799 wood samples collected in 3 harvests corresponding to two coppice rotations at one site and one coppice rotation at the second. Calibrations were developed and validated using 120 reference samples, representing spectral and chemical variations in the samples. The resulting global and site specific calibrations {{for most of the}} traits were at least good enough for ranking of genotypes, demonstrating the usefulness of NIR analysis for phenotyping the studied population. Clonal repeatability (View the MathML sourceHc 2) estimates of the studied traits based on all samples were moderate to high (View the MathML sourceHc 2 ranging from 0. 57 to 0. 89 in the 3 harvests). When data were pooled over coppice rotations or sites, the genotype × environment interaction was more evident across sites than across rotations. However, the interaction was smaller than the genotype main effect for all traits, except for glucose and extractives contents. Importantly, the interaction resulted mainly from re-ranking of a few genotypes leaving a substantial amount of stable and performant genetic material, which may encourage breeding for improved main wood components.

Also the initiation of latewood formation, and the consequences for latewood percentage was studied. The study site was a <b>clonal</b> <b>trial</b> established as a classical randomized complete block design eliminating some of the site variations in growth conditions. At year 20 from stand establishment, micro-cores were extracted once a week from 16 trees representing four different clones, with known ranking of apical growth rhythm in the spring (bud flush). The sampling were continuously {{during the growing season}} from May until October 2010. Tracheid formation started in the beginning of May and ceased in August. The four clones studied were known from measurements at a very juvenile age to be contrasting in respect to timing of bud flush. One flushed very early, one very late and two were more intermediate. This were confirmed by registrations made now and also at age 20, there were significant differences between them (p 0. 05). Thus the ones with the narrowest ring width did have greater latewood percentage. The results revealed genetic variation between the clones studied with one particular clone showing significantly higher number but narrower tracheids. Thus genetic {{variation in}} the progress of xylem formation was found, but this genetic variation seems to be fairly independent from the genetic variation in bud flush. However, this offers opportunities for further research. This study also contained a methodological study of techniques for preparation of micro-cores in the laboratory, which resulted in a recommendation of the razorblade cutting method.

Significant differences were observed in mechanical properties among hybrids and P. deltoides. The effects of growth on the mechanical properties were inconsistent and varied considerably by site and by hybrid.

40|$|SUGAR RESEARCH Australia (SRA) uses a {{selection}} index within the variety improvement program called Economic Genetic Value {{to determine which}} clones will be advanced to {{the next stage of}} selection. Economic Genetic Value is determined from a number of traits including cane yield and sugar content which are both quantitative. Within the Northern region of the Australian sugar industry, a visual subjective rating, mainly assessing the propensity of lodging and flowering and suckering, is included as an appearance grade. Suckering within commercial crops of sugarcane can lead to a decline in CCS while elevating overall tonnes of product delivered to the mill. To assess the propensity of suckering, a linear equation of sucker weight as a function of sucker height and number was established. It is important to refine the relationship matrix for sucker weight based on the size and number of suckers. For the current study, data from two first <b>clonal</b> <b>trials</b> were used and selection of the top 25 % of clones, based only on old and new appearance grade methods, without consideration of cane yield and sugar content, was simulated.

Recently in the north central US, several clones were planted on larger-than-research-scale plots on private land recontracted under the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP).

When compared to a seedling control progeny present in both trials, the selected genotypes showed a much lower relative early yield value in the clone trial than in the hybrid trial. This might suggest superiority for early yield of seedling trees in comparison to plagiotropic clonal trees. In addition, a similar level of variation was observed between trees within a seedling progeny and within a clone, suggesting that inter-tree variation is mainly due to environment. Correlation analysis revealed that the values of clones could not properly be predicted from those of the single trees from which they were obtained. On the other hand, the average values of the progenies to which the selected trees belong appeared as better predictors of the values of the clones obtained from these progenies, but the correlations remained rather low (r values of roughly 0. 5), even when significant, and only the yield assessed on the tree...|$|E

There were significant quantitative genetic variations among the clones and progenies, suggesting polygenic control of the resistance. Around 50 - 65 % tree mortality was the optimal disease level for calculating heritability and genetic gains. General and specific combining abilities calculated within the optimal disease range for partial diallel analysis were significant. Broad-sense heritability for the same analysis and same disease range was moderate (0. 329), and corresponding narrow-sense heritability was low (0. 112).

This will, no doubt, also improve the adoption of these grossly under-utilized species of West African origin. Sterility, self and cross incompatibilities, unpleasantly tall trees and low nut yield are among the problems faced by growers of this crop. As the crop takes up to seven years to produce its first fruit, while some trees may not bear fruit within the first fifteen years of field establishment or even throughout life, many farmers have adopted other crops as their source of livelihood.

Efficient selection strategies using selection indices are also presented in discussion section. For C. citriodora subsp. variegata <b>clonal</b> <b>trials,</b> Quambalaria shoot blight damage at the ages of 1. 0 - 1. 7 years and 3. 5 - 3. 8 years was under predominantly non-additive genetic control (H 2 = 0. 02 - 0. 46, h 2 = 0 - 0. 17). Growth traits were, overall, under moderate genetic control (H 2 = 0. 32 - 0. 54, h 2 = 0 - 0. 54). For tree height, nearly 100 % of the genetic variances were contributed by the non-additive component. For diameter at breast height and individual tree volume, the dominant genetic variances were non-additive (66 - 80 %) at the Coffs Harbour and Grafton sites, whilst the additive variances (88 - 100 %) became dominant at the other two sites. Bark thickness and percentage (H 2 = 0. 45 - 0. 81) and non-destructive wood properties (H 2 = 0. 57 - 0. 87) were under moderate to high genetic control, with 45 - 100 % of the genetic variances being additive for bark traits and basic density and 76 - 100 % of the genetic variances being non-additive for acoustic stiffness (represented by acoustic velocity squared). Growth traits were strongly correlated with Quambalaria damage, especially for the second assessment (rg = 0. 53 - 0. 85). Correlations between growth and bark traits showed that larger trees tended to have thicker bark (rg = 0. 50 - 0. 79), but did not necessarily have higher bark proportion (rg = - 0. 48 to 0. 26). There was no significant relationship between growth traits and wood properties (Pilodyn penetration, basic density or acoustic velocity squared), but strongly negative correlations between Pilodyn penetration and acoustic velocity squared (rg = - 0. 76 to - 0. 53). Basic density and Pilodyn penetration were highly negatively correlated (rg = - 0. 95 to - 1. 00). Low across-site correlations for Quambalaria damage (rg = 0. 13 - 1. 00) were observed, indicating genotype by environment interactions (GEIs) occurred. Across-site correlations for growth traits were reasonably high, with most estimates above 0. 8. Relatively lower correlations (under 0. 7), however, were also found between some pairs of sites. These lower correlations for growth traits were {{probably due to the}} disease effects or due to some degree of GEL By contrast, across-site correlations for wood properties (rg = 0. 84 - 0. 99) and bark traits (rg = 0. 83 - 0. 96) were notably high, especially those for basic density, indicating no significant GEI. For E. urophylla progeny trials, growth traits (h 2 = 0. 05 - 0. 39) were under low to moderate additive genetic control, whereas bark traits (h 2 = 0. 22 - 0. 38) and wood properties (h 2 = 0. 35 - 0. 66) were under moderate to strong additive genetic control. Narrow-sense heritabilities for growth traits and basic density appeared to decrease over generations. The larger trees tended to have thicker bark (rg = 0. 48 to 0. 57) but did not necessarily have higher bark percentage (rg = - 0. 40 to 0. 32). Correlations between growth traits and basic density (say diameter at breast height and Pilodyn penetration) were favourable strong in the first generation (rg = 0. 26 and 0. 48) but were not significantly different from zero in the second generation (rg = - 0. 06 and 0. 20). There was strong negative correlation (rg = - 1. 00) between basic density and Pilodyn penetration. Acoustic velocity squared was highly positively correlated with basic density (rg = 0. 63) (except Pilodyn penetration, rg = - 0. 04) and growth traits (rg = 0. 49 - 0. 63). Across-site correlation for diameter at breast height within the inland Dongmen region (rg = 0. 81) indicated that there was no GEI. However, GEIs for growth traits were significant between Dongmen and Shankou (rg = 0. 37 - 0. 79). No GEI for basic density was present either within the Dongmen region (rg = 1. 00) or between Dongmen and Shankou (rg = 0. 99). Traits with higher heritabilities (e. g. wood property traits) in the first generation had higher across-generation correlations (rg = 0. 63 - 1. 00). On the contrary, traits with lower heritabilities (e. g. growth traits) had lower across-generation correlations (rg = - 0. 26 to 0. 83).

A total of 27 clones of Eucalyptus urophylla and 22 clones of Eucalyptus grandis were used, sourced from a <b>clonal</b> <b>trial</b> set up in Martinho Campos, Minas Gerais. After evaluation using nondestructive techniques of resistography and pin penetration at a constant pressure (Pilodyn®), individuals were felled and disks were removed from the 2 %, 10 %, 30 %, 50 % and 70 % portions of the merchantable height section, and also from the portion 1. 30 m above ground level. Basic density was determined by the water immersion method.

A <b>clonal</b> <b>trial</b> was set up in 2008 in Palma So la, by statistical design of randomized complete blocks considering 29 clones, six replications, six plants per plot, and 3. 0 m x 3. 0 m spacing. The silvicultural characters of total plant height, diameter of breast height (dbh), and wood volume were evaluated through 24, 36, 48, and 60 months old. The deviance analysis and estimates of genetic parameters were based on the REML / BLUP genetic statistical procedure. Significant differences were observed for all traits in the deviance analysis. High correlations and statistically significant between characters were observed, indicating that the early selection will provide significant gains. Part of the clones USP/IPEF 64, USP/IPEF 78, USP/IPEF 52, USP/IPEF 68, and USP/IPEF 74) are potential to be used into the breeding programs and in commercial stands into the studied frost regions...|$|E

40|$|International audienceContexthe genetic {{development}} of some wood quality characteristics {{in early stage}} is particularly attractive since these properties are generally inherited. A {{clear understanding of the}} genetic control of chemical properties of wood (extractives, holocellulose, and lignin content) and growth traits (tree height, diameter at breast height, and stem volume) of corewood is a prerequisite for breeding for higher wood quality in triploid hybrid clones of Populus tomentosa. • Aims The experiments aimed at unraveling genetic effect and clone[*]×[*]site interactions on chemical properties of wood and growth traits of corewood derived from triploid hybrid clones of P. tomentosa. • Methods Four 5 -year-old <b>clonal</b> <b>trials</b> established in northern China were used to determine the clonal variations and clone[*]×[*]site interactions of chemical properties of wood and growth traits. Two hundred sixteen trees from nine clones were sampled in the four sites. • Results Site had a highly significant (P[*]<[*] 0. 001) effect on extractives and tree growth and a moderate effect on lignin and holocellulose. Clonal effects were also significant (P[*]<[*] 0. 05) for all studied traits. Clone[*]×[*]site interactions were significant for all studied traits except for holocellulose. No significant estimated correlations between chemical properties of wood and growth traits were observed. However, a weak and negative estimated correlation between lignin and growth traits existed. This suggests that selection for growth traits might lead to a minor reduction in lignin in triploid breeding of P. tomentosa. • Conclusions Our results revealed that chemical properties of wood were under stronger genetic control than growth traits in triploid hybrid clones of P. tomentosa. Therefore, breeding programs might be able to improve these chemical properties of wood and growth traits in these hybrids...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{production}} of teak wood has been decreased and failured to fulfill market demands. Improvement in silviculture treatment shortened teak rotation {{turning it into}} fast growing species with the wood quality similar to its origin. Most of research on wood quality of teak (Tectona grandis L. f.) were focused on determining physical properties (density and specific gravity), wood structure (fiber dimension and Microfibril Angle (MFA)) and mechanical properties (Modulus of Elasticity, MOE and Modulus of Rupture, MOR). Variation in terms of wood qualities was widely observed. However, understanding {{the causes of the}} variation patterns of wood quality at the nano level is still lacking. This research aims to analyze growth variation and wood quality (nanostructure) from two different spacings (3 m x 3 m and 2 m x 6 m) and two different origins of clones, i. e Cepu and Madiun. The teak samples were taken from 7 -years-old <b>clonal</b> <b>trials</b> in the research site of Watu Sipat Forests, Biotechnology and Forest Tree Improvement Research Facilities in Yogyakarta. Results showed that fenotype does not affect wood quality. Nanostructure of fast growing teak has influenced wood strength and durability. MOE was influenced by density, MFA, degree of crystallinity and width of cellulose crystallites. Apart of these findings, this research also highlighted the presence of preservative that could be detected in cell wall of wood through structure and dimension of cellulose crystallinity. In conclusion, wood quality characteristics from clone of Madiun was better than that of clone of Cepu, particularly at the spacing of 2 m x 6 m. This spacing, therefore, is considered importantly for economic, ecological and wood quality cloned teak developmen...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{variability}} of {{modulus of elasticity}} (MOE) was investigated in three genetic trials, including two progeny (16 years old) and one clonal (19 years old) trials of hybrid larch (Larix x eurolepis Henry). MOE was directly assessed on standing trees using the Rigidimeter, a bending device, and related to other traits including height, BH diameter and wood density. Mean MOE ranged from 5, 183 to 9, 228 MPa among families in the progeny trials and from 4, 591 to 11, 486 MPa in the <b>clonal</b> <b>trial.</b> Among traits studied, MOE {{was one of the}} most variable traits. It was strongly and positively related to wood density at both the individual and genotype mean levels. Interestingly too, wood stiffness did not seem, or only weakly, unfavourably linked to stem diameter at the phenotypical level, but it was negatively or not correlated to diameter at the genetic level. As well, MOE showed a high GxE stability over the two progeny trial sites. Narrow-sense heritabilities for MOE were moderate (around 0. 36). In all three trials, they were lower than those for wood density or total height, and of the same level as for diameter. Improvement of wood stiffness of hybrid larch using the Rigidimeter seems possible and promising genetic gains are expected. Impacts of selection for growth traits on MOE are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Ash trees {{which are}} {{tolerant}} to Hymenoscyphus fraxineus may be selected in all age classes among heavily infected populations. They may be produced also by controlled crossings of disease tolerant trees, because the genetic component of inheritance for disease tolerance is high. For mature and juvenile plant material, {{the deployment of}} disease tolerant genotypes could be potentially achieved by vegetatively propagating selected genotypes. We describe a system to vegetatively propagate selected ash genotypes and we discuss the prospects and options for using vegetative propagation on all age classes of trees. Mature trees were rejuvenated {{through the process of}} micropropagation to establish mother plants in large trays which were cut back repeatedly (hedged) to produce at least two crops of cuttings per year. The rooting capacity of ten genotypes was tested by a commercial nursery over a period of three years, to assess the feasibility of using hedged mother plants for efficient propagation. Commercial practise was to treat cuttings with 0. 25 % IBA, insert them in plug pots and maintain them covered with fine plastic within low plastic tunnels in a non heated greenhouse and without supplementary heating at the cutting base. In the first year, the mean rooting rate was 53 % for the first crop of cuttings and 35 % for the second. In the second and third years the rooting rates improved to over 80 % for each crop of cuttings as experience was gained in handling the material. Rooting rate varied among the genotypes. We assessed the growth and development of micropropagated ash trees in the field from an observation <b>clonal</b> <b>trial,</b> consisting of four mature genotypes which had been established in 2002 in five replicate plots. The micropropagated trees were generally similar in height and dbh to seed derived control trees and developed normally. These observations are discussed in the context of using vegetative propagation as a tool in breeding and for the large scale deployment of ash with tolerance to H. fraxineus. book chapterThis publication is {{based on the work of}} Action FP 1103 FRAXBACK, supported by COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) European Cooperation in Science and Technolog...|$|E
40|$|The recent need {{to develop}} a source of high value logs for sawn timber {{products}} to replace the declining supplies from native forests has resulted in the rapid expansion of spotted gum plantations in Queensland and northern New South Wales. Quambalaria shoot blight, caused by the fungus Quambalaria pitereka, is a serious disease affecting this expansion (Simpson, 2000; Self et al., 2002; Carnegie, 2007 b; Pegg et al., 2008). This study aimed to develop a disease management strategy through investigating aspects of the pathogens biology. Initially we aimed to determine which species of Quambalaria are associated with shoot blight symptoms on Corymbia spp. Surveys identified three Quambalaria spp. — Q. pitereka, Q. eucalypti and Q. cyanescens — from native and plantation eucalypts as well as amenity plantings. Symptom descriptions and morphological studies were coupled with phylogenetic studies using ITS rDNA sequence data. Quambalaria pitereka was the causal agent of blight symptoms on species and hybrids in the Corymbia complex. Quambalaria eucalypti was identified from Eucalyptus species and a single Corymbia hybrid. Quambalaria cyanescens was detected from native and plantation Corymbia spp. Quambalaria spp. are pathogens of growing global importance, yet virtually nothing is known about {{the manner in which they}} infect and colonise their hosts. A study of the infection process of Q. pitereka and Q. eucalypti on Corymbia and Eucalyptus species was thus undertaken using light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy after artificial inoculation. For both species, conidial germination was triggered at relative humidity (RH) levels above 90 % and commenced within 2 hours in the presence of free water. Light reduced the percentage germination but did not prevent germination. Conidial germination and hyphal growth occurred on the upper and lower leaf surfaces with penetration occurring via the stomata or wounds on the leaf surface or juvenile stems. There was no evidence of direct penetration of the host epidermis. Following penetration through the stomata, hyphae of Q. pitereka and Q. eucalypti grew only intercellularly without the formation of haustoria or any other interaction apparatus. Instead, the presence of an interaction zone is demonstrated in this thesis. Conidiophores arose through stomatal openings and produced conidia seven days after infection. Incorporation of screening for resistance to Q. pitereka into current breeding programs is essential for the future development of plantations using spotted gum and Corymbia hybrids. An additional part of this study was to determine whether there is variability in susceptibility to infection by Q. pitereka among different species and provenances of spotted gum and to identify variability among and within families of spotted gum. We also considered whether the seed source origin is a significant indicator of susceptibility. Assessments were conducted in trials consisting of spotted gum provenances, families and clones, all at the same site and with high levels of disease pressure and with optimum climatic conditions for disease development. While all species and provenances of spotted gum could be infected by Q. pitereka, results showed that there are high levels of variability in susceptibility among and within species, provenances and families, indicating the potential to select for disease resistance. Provenance was shown to be an unreliable indicator of susceptibility to Q. pitereka. A spotted gum <b>clonal</b> <b>trial</b> provided the opportunity to investigate the impact of the disease on tree growth and factors influencing wood quality. The effect of Q. pitereka on productivity when infection occurs during plantation establishment and the value of deploying resistant germplasm were determined. The results showed that Q. pitereka has a significant impact on plantation establishment and emphasised the negative impact on wood quality and value in sawlog production where unimproved or incorrectly selected germplasm is deployed. Tree growth, based on height and diameter as well as tree form, was significantly improved where germplasm with low susceptibility to Q. pitereka infection was used. Disease development within plantation-grown spotted gum was examined and an understanding of the epidemiology of Q. pitereka and factors influencing disease development established. It was shown that native spotted gum is a primary source of inoculum, followed rapidly by the production of secondary inoculum from infected trees in the plantation. The rate of spread and development of Q. pitereka within plantations increased exponentially over time as additional trees became infected and produced secondary inoculum. Spore concentration was shown to play an important role in disease development with disease severity increasing with increasing disease incidence on individual trees and incidence across the plantation. An understanding of pathogen variability and host-pathogen interactions is needed to develop management strategies for the disease. The aim of the study was to determine if there was any difference in host range of Q. pitereka isolates and any variability in aggressiveness of these isolates. It was evident for the first time that Q. pitereka isolates differ in their level of aggressiveness towards hosts. Of the isolates tested, two were consistently more aggressive, based on incidence and severity of disease and lesion size, on spotted gum species and C. torelliana...|$|E

40|$|Clonal forestry, the {{establishment}} of plantations using tested clones, is highly sought after by the forestry industry in New Zealand and worldwide. Clonal testing is a vital element in the process leading to clonal forestry. Two <b>clonal</b> <b>trials</b> established in 1986 and 1987 by the Forest Research Institute with juvenile ortet material have been analysed in this study. The mating design in the 1986 clones-in-family trial was single-pair crossing with amplification of the clones by fascicle cuttings. It was replicated over two sites, and the trait analysed was diameter at 1. 40 m height at ages 4, 7, and 10 years. The estimation of additive, non-additive and genetic variances showed {{a high proportion of}} non-additive variance compared with the additive variance at one of the sites, whereas the proportion was less important at the other site. The high non-additive component of variance can be due to important dominance or epistasis, or to C-effects confounded with the non-additive variance. This trend was similar for all three ages. Realised genetic gains were obtained from selection of clones at age 10 years for clonal deployment and breeding. For clonal deployment, realised gains were high at both sites (13 % and 16 %). The gains were similar at both sites provided selection was based on performance values at the site, and not on indirect selection on performance of clones at the other site. Realised gains for selection at age 10 based on the performance of clones on combined sites (10 % and 13 %) were less than the maximum gain obtained at each individual site. Gains based on information from both sites (10 % and 12 % at respective sites) were more stable than those selections at any one site. For breeding, the level of gain was significantly inferior than for clonal deployment (4 % and 8 %), especially when the number of clones per family was restricted to one (2 % and 4 %). Realised gain on combined-site selection yielded less gain than direct selection at the optimum site for selection (1 % and 2 %). The presence of genotype x environment interaction emphasised the need to test clones in several sites if stability of performance is desired. It is possible to obtain gain from selections made at an early age, but selections made for breeding at the age of final assessment yielded greater expected total gain and gain per unit time. The mating design in the 1987 clones-in-family trial was a 3 x 3 disconnected factorial. The trial was established on a single site and the trait analysed was percentage of Dothistroma needle infection at ages 3, 4 and 7 years. The mating design allowed estimation of additive, dominance and epistasis variances, which were overestimated for the lack of replication over sites. In this trial measured for Dothistroma resistance, the additive variance was the major component of the genetic variance at both ages. The evolution of components of genetic variance was confounded with the level of Dothistroma infection. The analysis of these trials indicated the need to improve the mating and field designs to improve the accuracy in the estimation of genetic parameters, highlights the importance of annual or biennual measurements to determine trends of those parameters over time, and showed the difference in gains obtained from selection for breeding and clonal deployment for early selection and selection at the age of final assessment. Accuracy in the estimation of genetic parameters can be achieved using factorial mating designs together with serial propagation to reduce the incidence of C effects, and with replication over several sites. Further considerations have to be made to find the most appropriate field and statistical design, but alpha designs are a possibility to explore.

40|$|The Forest Biology Research Cooperative {{recently}} {{established a}} series of loblolly pine <b>clonal</b> <b>trials</b> known as CCLONES (Comparing Clonal Lines on Experimental Sites). There are three primary levels of genetic structure in this study (parental, full-sib family, clone) that strengthen the power of CCLONES for examining genetic mechanisms and interactions with cultural treatments and locations. A fourth level of genetic structure can be added by considering the provenance of the parents. This report includes some preliminary results from the genetic analyses of 2 nd year growth traits that were recently measured at the CCLONES loblolly pine trials. The specific objectives of this report are 1) to determine heritability estimates for various growth traits for loblolly pine clones and seedlings, 2) to compare the genetic correlations between parents and families when grown as cuttings versus seedlings, and 3) to determine the genotype x environment interaction {{by looking at the}} genetic correlations for parents, families, and clones for paired trials. MATERIALS AND METHODS The parental population consisted of twenty first-generation and ten second-generation selections from a larger population {{that is part of the}} Loblolly Pine Lower Gulf Elite Population. In addition two slow-growing parents were included. These selections represent the Atlantic Coastal Plain (ACP), Florida (FL), and Lower Gulf (LG) provenances of loblolly pine. These thirty-two elite loblolly pine parents were mated in a partial diallel design and created 70 full-sib families from which a total of 2, 000 vegetatively propagated clones were generated. Rooted cuttings from approximately 1, 000 of these clones from 61 full-sib families and seedlings from the same full-sib families were established at seven field sites across the southeastern United States utilizing a resolvable incomplete block design (Tests A-G). Each growth variable (2 nd year height, height increment, and crown width) was analyzed for cuttings and seedlings simultaneously with a bivariate analysis in ASREML. Narrow-sense 2 heritability (ˆh) was estimated using the corresponding variance components.
