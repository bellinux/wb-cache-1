5000|$|The PocketFami {{features}} a standard D-pad and six buttons: the four standard NES buttons (A, B, select, and start), plus two additional [...] "turbo" [...] buttons. It {{features a}} 2.5 inch backlit LCD screen capable of displaying both NTSC and PAL video. It has one headphone jack, an RCA composite output jack, {{and can be}} powered either through 3 AA batteries or AC adapter. Because of the different <b>cartridge</b> <b>pin</b> design of the Japanese Famicom (60 pins) and the international NES (72 pins), international (North American, Australian, European) cartridges cannot be played without an additional converter.|$|E
50|$|The Famicom has two <b>cartridge</b> <b>pins</b> {{that were}} {{originally}} intended to facilitate the Disk System's own sound chip, but are also used by cartridge games to provide sound enhancements. In {{the design of the}} NES, these pins were removed from the cartridge port and relocated to the bottom expansion port. As a result, individual cartridges can not make use of this audio functionality, and many NES localizations suffer from technologically inferior sound compared to their equivalent Famicom versions. Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse is a notable example of this problem.|$|R
40|$|Construction is not {{possible}} without joining single parts to components {{and at the end}} to the final structure. There exist multifarious kinds of connections whose suitability mainly depends on the characteristic of raw material the structural parts are made of. This article especially deals with joints in metallic light weight structures. Beside the typical connections in metal structures like welding, bolting and riveting in metallic light weight structures further kinds of connections can be found like standing seam, clinch, punch rivet or <b>cartridge</b> fired <b>pin</b> connections. Describing all these single methods would go {{beyond the scope of this}} article. That is why only the predominant part of all connections with so called pencil-shaped fastening elements like screwed connections, blind riveted connections and connections with <b>cartridge</b> fired <b>pins</b> will be dealt with. Furthermore the scope of application will be shown, advantages and disadvantages will be compared, the determination of characteristic values or resistance will be shortly explained and advices for calculation and execution will be given...|$|R
5000|$|A {{powerhead}} {{consists of}} a long length of tubing which is the [...] chamber for the <b>cartridge,</b> a firing <b>pin</b> to fire the cartridge, and usually some form of safety pin or latch that prevents firing when it is engaged. The rear of the power head is fitted with some provision for attaching to a spear.|$|R
50|$|The first {{commercial}} {{version of the}} Retrode featured an aluminum profile enclosure with two slots to accommodate SNES and Sega Genesis game <b>cartridges.</b> Internal soldering <b>pins</b> allowed users to retrofit up to four ports for SNES controllers. The successor model, the Retrode 2, used a plastic enclosure with a dust cover, and had four controller ports built in—two for each system, SNES and Sega Genesis.|$|R
40|$|Thin-walled cold-formed {{members are}} thin, {{this will give}} rise to {{behavioural}} phenomena, which are not usually encountered in the more familiar hot-rolled sections. When compared to hot-rolled steel sections, cold-formed thin-walled steel sections {{are more likely to}} fail in local buckling, distortional buckling, various global buckling and shear buckling. This paper will discuss types of connection in Jjoints for coldformed thin-walled sections and steel sheeting. Bolts, screws, blind rivets or <b>cartridge</b> fired <b>pins</b> are commonly used in joints for coldformed thin-walled sections or steel sheet connections. Fasteners in light gauge steel tend to be relatively less stiff than their counterparts in heavier construction so that connection flexibility can be significant in certain assemblies. Furthermore, as in any load-bearing structure, it is important that connections are not brittle and this implies that there should be adequate deformation capacity...|$|R
5000|$|The Master {{featured}} several improvements on its predecessor. The systems had 128 KB RAM as standard, alleviating {{the shortage}} of available RAM which had amongst other things discouraged use of the best graphics modes in the original design, and had two cartridge slots mounted above the new numerical keypad. These were physically identical to those used by the Acorn Electron 'Plus 1' interface, but with enhanced electrical characteristics {{for some of the}} <b>cartridge</b> connector <b>pins.</b> [...] Rather than the MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor used by the Model B it ran on the slightly improved 65SC12: the cost of this CPU compatibility with the Model B was that the address bus was still only 16 bits, meaning that only 64 KB could be directly addressed at any one time and the remaining memory had to be paged in as required.|$|R
50|$|Casimir Lefaucheux of Paris {{decided in}} 1832 to patent a breechloader where the barrel hinged {{downwards}} {{to reveal the}} breech ends. These still used a separate percussion cap. Though used before this, (as seen in surviving pinfire shotshells that lists the names of early gun makers he signed contracts with in 1833 and 1834,) in 1835 he was granted an addition to the 1832 patent for {{a new type of}} cartridge in which the cartridge's priming compound is ignited by striking a small pin which protrudes radially from just above the base of the <b>cartridge.</b> These <b>pins</b> fitted into a small groove cut in the top of each barrel-end and made it easy to see if the gun was loaded. The cartridge used metal bases (often brass) with paper tubes which were usually loaded by the shooter or his staff but were not entirely gas-tight. This reduced the force of the charge and allowed powder residue and gas to escape.|$|R
25|$|When Nintendo {{released}} the NES in the US, the design styling was deliberately {{different from that}} of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge’s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of <b>cartridges</b> caused the <b>pins</b> to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF design proved more prone to interference by dirt and dust than an industry-standard card edge connector. These design issues were not alleviated by Nintendo’s choice of materials; the console slot nickel connector springs would wear due to design and the game cartridge copper connectors were also prone to tarnishing. Many players would try to alleviate issues in the game caused by this corrosion by blowing into the cartridges, then reinserting them, which actually hurt the copper connectors by speeding up the tarnishing.|$|R
