5|$|Double Fine {{demonstrated}} an in-progress {{version of the}} remastered game at the 2014 IndieCade event in October 2014; new features included higher-resolution textures and improved resolution for the character models as well as having real-time lighting models, {{and the ability to}} switch back and forth between this presentation and the original graphics {{at the touch of a}} control. The remastered game runs in 4:3 aspect ratio but has an option to stretch this to a 16:9 ratio rather than render in a native 16:9 ratio. The remaster includes improvements to the control scheme developed by Pfaff's patch and other alternate control schemes in addition to the original tank-like controls, including analogue <b>controls</b> <b>for</b> console versions and point-and-click <b>controls</b> <b>for</b> computer versions. The game's soundtrack was fully orchestrated through performances of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (who also performed the soundtrack for Double Fine's Broken Age). The remastered version also includes developer commentary, which can be activated via the options menu and listened to at various points in the game. The PlayStation version also features cloud saving between the PS4 and Vita versions.|$|E

40|$|In {{light of}} the complex and highly {{uncertain}} nature of dynamical systems requiring controls, {{it is not surprising}} that reliable system models for many high performance engineering and life science applications are unavailable. In the face of such high levels of system uncertainty, robust controllers may unnecessarily sacrifice system performance whereas adaptive controllers are clearly appropriate since they can tolerate far greater system uncertainty levels to improve system performance. In this dissertation, we develop a Lyapunov-based direct adaptive and neural adaptive control framework that addresses parametric uncertainty, unstructured uncertainty, disturbance rejection, amplitude and rate saturation constraints, and digital implementation issues. Specifically, we consider the following research topics: direct adaptive <b>control</b> <b>for</b> nonlinear uncertain systems with exogenous disturbances; robust adaptive <b>control</b> <b>for</b> nonlinear uncertain systems; adaptive <b>control</b> <b>for</b> nonlinear uncertain systems with actuator amplitude and rate saturation constraints; adaptive reduced-order dynamic compensation for nonlinear uncertain systems; direct adaptive <b>control</b> <b>for</b> nonlinear matrix second-order dynamical systems with state-dependent uncertainty; adaptive <b>control</b> <b>for</b> nonnegative and compartmental dynamical systems with applications to general anesthesia; direct adaptive control of nonnegative and compartmental dynamical systems with time delay; adaptive <b>control</b> <b>for</b> nonlinear nonnegative and compartmental dynamical systems with applications to clinical pharmacology; neural network adaptive <b>control</b> <b>for</b> nonlinear nonnegative dynamical systems; passivity-based neural network adaptive output feedback <b>control</b> <b>for</b> nonlinear nonnegative dynamical systems; neural network adaptive dynamic output feedback <b>control</b> <b>for</b> nonlinear nonnegative systems using tapped delay memory units; Lyapunov-based adaptive <b>control</b> framework <b>for</b> discrete-time nonlinear systems with exogenous disturbances; direct discrete-time adaptive control with guaranteed parameter error convergence; and hybrid adaptive <b>control</b> <b>for</b> nonlinear uncertain impulsive dynamical systems.

5|$|Mobius Final Fantasy is a {{role-playing}} game {{designed for}} mobile phones. The player controls the game's protagonist Warrior of Light (Wol) while navigating Palamecia.

5|$|Miyamoto {{initially}} intended Ocarina of Time to {{be played}} in a first-person perspective to enable players {{to take in the}} vast terrain of Hyrule Field better, as well as to be able to focus more on developing enemies and environments.

Ocarina of Time originally ran on the same engine as Super Mario 64, but was so heavily modified that designer Shigeru Miyamoto considers the final products entirely different engines. One major difference between the two is camera control; the player has a lot of control over the camera in Super Mario 64, but the camera in Ocarina of Time is largely controlled by the game's AI. Miyamoto says the camera <b>controls</b> <b>for</b> Ocarina of Time are intended to reflect a focus on the game's world, whereas those of Super Mario 64 are centered on the character of Mario.|$|E
5|$|Players {{have access}} to a {{communication}} system {{that can be used to}} contact other starfighters, which has more impact in the game's single-player mode. Through the system, the player can order either a single starfighter, a wing, or all craft (depending on how many are still active), with tasks such as taking down a player's target, covering the player, or engaging all hostiles, amongst other commands. The system can also be used to call in for reinforcements (if available), and requesting deployment of a support ship to repair a player's subsystems as well as re-arm their secondary weapons; the support ship can be given limited orders when deployed. Furthermore, a player can manage the energy input of certain subsystems, thus affecting how efficient it is in battle; changing the input for engines, for example, changes the max speed of the craft and the time needed to fully recharge the ship's afterburners. The <b>controls</b> <b>for</b> the game in both modes are designed so that players have ease with controlling their starfighter and its systems, and be able to do so with either a joystick, or a keyboard (on its own or with a mouse). Because of the flexibility in controls, some have categorised Descent: FreeSpace as a flight simulator, since it has more controls and commands than a typical arcade game, yet its flight model is simple, akin to that of the game , and incorporates some elements of Newtonian physics such as precise collision physics.|$|E

Bannakaffalatta reveals that he is a cyborg, and uses his internal EMP device to disable the Hosts. The EMP burst drains the Zocci's power cells and he dies.

A lone Angel Host attacks them again, and Foon ties herself to it and throws them both into the ship's engine.
