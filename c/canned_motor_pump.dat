The primary objective was {{the development of}} a long life bearings for canned motor pumps. The research project was a joint effort between the University of Virginia, Kingsbury, Incorporated, and Goulds Pump Company. The research team designed, constructed and tested the bearings in a 20 hp, 300 gpm, single stage centrifugal <b>canned</b> <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> running at 3600 rpm. Both magnetic radial and thrust bearings were incorporated in retrofitted bearing housings. Displacement probes sensed the shaft position near the bearings. Control electronics then employed the displacement signal as the feedback signal to control the level of current in the magnets. Proportional-integral-derivative type analog controls were used. The bearings were successfully installed and tested. Performance and vibration tests were conducted on the <b>canned</b> <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> with the original bearings and with the magnetic bearings. No significant change was found in the pump performance but some small changes were observed in the pump vibration characteristics. It is believed by the authors {{that this is the first}} installation of magnetic bearings in a commercial pump...|$|E

40|$|The {{expectations}} for {{heat transfer fluid}} (HTF) system safety and reliability are continuing to increase. The challenges are many. Leaks produce vapors that ignite readily, fluid viscosity is very low, {{and many of the}} fluids react with oxygen in undesirable ways. Sealless pumps are well suited to HTF applications, eliminating many of the issues which challenge mechanical seals. In addition, one type of sealless pump, the <b>canned</b> <b>motor</b> <b>pump,</b> raises the thermal efficiency of HTF systems. Waste heat from the drive motors of most pumps is dissipated to the air. A shaft driven fan wastes additional energy to accomplish this heat transfer. The waste heat from canned motor pumps can be entirely transferred to the HTF. Methods for analyzing the energy savings and cost implications are provided along with explanations of the other benefits of sealless pumps...|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 5 There was a {{time when}} people worked on radiologically {{contaminated}} equipment with a low level of protection, when equipment leakage was considered unavoidable, and when contaminated equipment was disposed of with little environmental regard. Emphasis was placed on production and productivity. Those times are gone! Environmental and personnel safety are of utmost importance. Practices and equipment must be re-evaluated in light of this new value system. This paper documents a synergistic teaming arrangement between user and manufacturer that resulted in a pump addressing this culture change.

Based on successful experiences for many years, magnetic drive pumps have been aggressively applied to improve the seal life for special services such as sulfur, caustic, ammonia, etc since 2005. The magnetic drive pump has been preferred because of various advantages (easy maintenance, robust design, leak free, etc). However, we have faced important and didactic issues due to inappropriate operating procedures, protection systems and design. Unless the application and operation are taken into a consideration for special services like as molten sulfur and ammonia, the consequences of pump failure could result in devastating damage to pump parts and even fire. This case study will show how the bad actors were improved, lessons learned and guidelines for reliable operation. Users are reluctant to apply protection systems fully compliant with API 685 or vendor recommendations for non-hazardous services based on economic considerations. But they should consider providing minimum protection systems for special services, if not for all pumps...|$|E

50|$|The {{transformer}} is cooled by {{a cooling}} agent {{made of a}} polyol-ester mix, which is recirculated by two independent <b>canned</b> <b>motor</b> pumps; these <b>pumps</b> make the occurrence of leaks almost impossible.

In cases where one pump fails, the cooling agent remains in the transformer tank; the transformer is capable of providing power at 65% of full capacity with just one pump in operation.|$|R
40|$|Tutorialpg. 115 Magnetic {{drive and}} <b>canned</b> <b>motor</b> <b>pumps</b> have many common {{features}} including bearing and rotor designs, internal cooling, and lubrication. The primary differences {{center on the}} manner in which the rotating magnetic field is created and the makeup of the stationary isolation device. Proper bearing lubrication is essential to long, reliable operation. Fluid film journal bearings are used to support the rotor and flatfaced thrust bearings to limit its axial travel. Hydraulic balance can be used to limit the loads transmitted to the thrust bearings. This can accomplished by either balance holes and set clearance throttling devices or pumping vanes, as in standard pumps or by variable clearance throttles that automatically adjust to maintain axial balance. A rotating magnetic field is generated by either an electrical stator coil or a rotating permanent magnet assembly. This drives an inner rotor consisting of induction motor laminations or permanent magnets. The barrier between the inner rotor and the atmosphere contains the process, but has nonmagnetic properties to allow the passage of the field undisturbed. Eddy currents are set up in the barrier and generate heat that must be removed. A clean cooling stream with sufficient margin from vaporization is required to carry of the heat generated by magnetic hysteresis and bearing friction loses. The pressure/temperature characteristics of the process dictate the type of circulation needed to maintain a liquid state. Instrumentation is offered to help monitor the condition of the cooling stream and avoid deadheaded and dry-running operation...|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 109 The {{environmental}} requirements that drive chemical producers {{to move more}} and more {{to the use of the}} ?sealless? pump are described. The development of the sealless pumps in the European industrial community and their application in various chemical services is traced. More significant developments are enumerated in the areas of design and materials as applied to this complex problem. Finally, a summary of the successes and failures of the sealless pump in various services are documented. The term sealless pump applies to the <b>canned</b> <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> and the magnetic drive or magnetically coupled pump. Both of these designs are discussed along with their relative merits. The sealless pump was developed specifically to totally eliminate the need for a mechanical sealing system. The mechanical seal, by its very design must, leak to survive and this feature is not acceptable in certain liquid services. The driving force behind this development was originally the handling of toxic (lethal) or pyrophoric, flammable liquids. This technology has, in recent years, found a new more formidable champion in the almost universal concern for the environment and in the governmental legislation relating to those concerns...|$|E
40|$|Now a day’s Constant {{electricity}} fluctuation {{and irregular}} power availability for irrigation are daily {{problems faced by}} many farmers for a long time. Though many farmers use diesel operated pumps, a suitable alternative, which requires neither diesel nor electricity and yet meets their irrigation requirements may be welcome. And also in home power will be wasted in so many situations due to those situations electricity bill increases. To rectify such type of problems we developed a device which is for use of controlling <b>Motor</b> <b>pumps</b> from any location. It is a mobile based remote control system [7] for switching on/off and monitoring the water pumps, by using which a farmer or a person can be free from so many routine problems associated with timely irrigation, saving a lot of water, electricity, fuel, time, cost effective.

40|$|Tutorialpg. 129 Exxon Chemical {{like many}} other {{petrochemical}} companies and refineries, is announcing emission plans with a long term goal to achieve continuous emission reduction from the plant sites. Exxon Chemical?s emission plan has reduced air emission by 90 percent since 1975, with work continuing to further reduce emissions {{over the next five}} years. These foals are being driven by company policy with concern for the environment, business competition, government regulations, and public concern {{over the past several years}}. Since many petrochemical and refinery employees, friends, and relatives live in areas where plants are located, they are just as concerned about safety and hygiene impact of emissions and waste disposal from the plants as the general public, environmental activist groups, and government agencies. Due to the steadily increasing public concern over the environment, the government regulations are becoming more restrictive in leakage criteria. A good example of this is the current regulatory debate to the Clean Air Act, which would require industry to utilize maximum achievable control technology. To reduce emissions, great improvements have been made over the past several years in pump mechanical seal design, evaluation, and auxiliary support systems. However, the mechanical seal design inherently requires a minute leakage across the faces for lubrication, along with costly auxiliary systems and environmental monitoring programs. Even with the improvements, mechanical seals remain the most fragile and weakest link of the pump; thus, they are the primary cause of pump failures [1] that can also contribute to emissions. Mechanical seals typically fail as a result as a result of many factors, such as process upsets, vibration problems, bearing failures, auxiliary support system failures, and problems caused from maintenance and operating personnel. Consequently, one solution to reducing pump failures due to mechanical seals and resulting emissions is to apply sealless pumps to more hazardous, toxic, or hydrocarbon services. For this reason, an engineering survey was launched to evaluate magnetic drive and <b>canned</b> <b>motor</b> <b>pumps.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|This paper calls {{attention}} {{to the importance of}} social cooperation in irrigation farming. It argues that a mere focus on the technical aspect of irrigation, disregarding its social aspects undermines the long-term benefits of irrigation to rural livelihoods. This assertion draws on lessons from small-irrigation practices in Fogera, in the Blue Nile Basin of Ethiopia, where I conducted fieldwork-based qualitative research. In recent years irrigation farming has drawn a growing interest among farmers in rural Fogera. Farmers practise small-scale irrigation that includes traditional irrigation and <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> irrigation. Farmers assert that irrigation has brought farming benefits through cultivation of more crops as well as new crops that serve food and cash purposes. Such benefits have particularly spurred the enthusiasm for <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> irrigation. However, the practice of <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> irrigation largely relies on the motor-pump technology, overlooking the social scheme of irrigation. While traditional irrigation involves more social cooperation involving joint activities, water allocations and irrigation schedules, lack of social cooperation and such institutional conditions is widespread in <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> irrigation. Local classification of irrigation practices also associate the mechanism of irrigation use and management including water use regulations and water use turns with traditional irrigation in contrast to <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> irrigation. The neglect of social cooperation within current practices of <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> irrigation will have significant adverse implications on long-term practices. Farmers have been already concerned about how competitions for water are growing, limiting the duration of water availability and creating water shortage. The study suggests that while farmers’ willingness to practise <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> irrigation in Fogera has been stimulated by its livelihood benefits, sustained benefits of this irrigation scheme require social cooperation and feasible institutional conditions that can mediate water usage across user villages...|$|R

40|$|In agriculture, the {{coexistence}} of {{different forms of}} land tenancy or labour contract has been explained so far by several theories related to Marshallian inefficiency, incentives, risk sharing, and transaction costs, including supervision costs. These theories and the empirical evidences have greatly contributed to explain the reasons behind land tenancy or labour contract choice. This study follows up on this. Moreover, it intends to take a further step by focusing particularly on the production technologies at plot level, and by designing and testing a theoretical model based on household profit optimization. This model will {{take into account the}} supervision costs of labour (i) to compare optimum profit derived from plots based on household labour, a sharecropping labour contract, and a wage labour contract, controlling for irrigation equipment (ii) to test the efficiency of the labour contract choice using data from Senegal’s horticultural zone. As expected, the production elasticity of labour decreases when improved irrigation equipment like a <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> is used. The technology displays an increasing return to scale on plots without a <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> and a constant return to scale on plots irrigated with a <b>motor</b> <b>pump.</b> While on plots without a <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> the sharecropping contract is the efficient labour contract choice, leading to a higher optimum profit for the household, on plots irrigated with a <b>motor</b> <b>pump,</b> the wage contract is the best labour contract choice. Consequently, we can conclude from this finding that the use of a <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> drives out the sharecropping contract in favour of household labour and the wage labour contract. land tenancy, labour, sharecropping, wage, contract, supervision, household, profit optimization, efficient, irrigation equipment, horticulture, Senegal, Agricultural Finance,...|$|R

The adoption of smallholder irrigation technologies {{as a means}} to tackle these challenges has become an important policy issue in the development agenda of the country. The lack of access to low-cost irrigation technologies is, however, one of the major bottlenecks to increase smallholder irrigation. This paper examines the factors influencing farmers’ decisions to adopt low-cost small <b>motor</b> <b>pumps.</b> The analysis is based on a survey of 800 farm households in four regions of Ethiopia.

This study analyses the effects of the determinants of groundwater irrigation technology adoption with a data from 240 smallholder irrigation farmers in Ghana. The empirical results show that household size and membership of farmer-based organizations tend to have positive significant impacts on the probability of adopting groundwater manual irrigation whilst extension contacts and farm size have negative impacts.
