40|$|Self-monitoring as a {{means of}} {{observation}} gives teachers proper respect and appropriate understanding of what they do when teaching. There is also a shift from an outsider to an insider as far as observation is concerned. It definitely gives teachers a great insight into their teaching {{and at the same time}} proves effective in improving their teaching. The purpose of this paper is two-fold. It first investigated the barriers that Iranian high school students face while speaking. This investigation was made by interviewing both students (language institutes and schools) and teachers. Teachers’ comments on the students’ answers and teachers’ separate answers on the causes of speaking problems were elicited.  It then made a comparison between the willingness to communicate (WTC) of high school and language institute students after the reflection (self-monitoring) of the teacher. To achieve this purpose 32 high school and 32 language institute students spent 10 sessions with a teacher who had previously reflected upon the speaking barriers collected from participants comments through oral interviews. The results of the study, using a independent t -test, clearly showed that language institute students were much more willing to communicate. Several reasons were also found to be highly important regarding students, teachers, and course materials. Both high-stake and low-stake holders <b>can</b> <b>avail</b> <b>from</b> the results of the study. </p...|$|E
