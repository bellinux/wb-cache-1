Turning to the modern literature, we review some of the ways in sociality has been introduced into decision and game theory by means of assumptions about non-self-interested preferences - specifically, assumptions about altruism, warm glow, inequality aversion and reciprocity. We identify some of the limitations of these theories as explanatory devices, and suggest that these limitations derive from a common source: that sociality is being represented within a framework of methodological individualism. We then discuss more radical approaches to explaining social interaction, based on the concepts of expressive rationality and team reasoning. Finally, we pose the fundamental question of whether it is possible to explain social interaction all the way down without going beyond the bounds of methodological individualism. ...|$|E
30|$|During {{the sample}} period, both the French and the United States labor market {{institutions}} were also characterized by important {{changes in the}} bargaining institutions and environment. In the 1970 s, centralized collective bargaining agreements (<b>convention</b> <b>collective</b> de branche) were {{the basic elements of}} the negotiation process in France. The different industrial sectors had collective agreements that were negotiated by groups of unions and employer associations. These agreements were binding on the negotiating parties. The complete agreement was then typically extended to cover the entire industry (or region) by the Ministry of Labor and was then made binding on workers and firms that were not party to the original negotiation (Cahuc and Kramarz (1997)). More than 95 % of the work force was covered by these collective bargaining agreements {{at the end of the}} 1980 s, while union membership was approximately 10 %. The collective agreements specified a set of minimum wages and wage progressions for the occupational categories covered by the negotiations (sometimes called a wage grid). But, beginning in 1982, the “lois Auroux” (a set of revisions to the body of labor law named after the Minister of Labor at the time) required firms with at least 50 employees to negotiate firm‐level collective agreements (accords d’entreprise). Although firms were not explicitly obligated to conclude an agreement, 65 % of the work force were employed at establishments or businesses where firm‐level negotiations occurred either through the union delegates or some other worker representative 8. Among this 65 % of the work force, only three‐quarters of the workers ended up with an agreement as a result of these negotiations. Finally, the percentage of the work force covered by some establishment or firm‐level agreement on wages is approximately 40 % in 1992. The law required that the firm‐level agreements could only improve the conditions stated in the industrial agreement, so that, over time, the firm‐level agreements have become more important for wage determination than the industry agreements.|$|E

Deux problèmes y sont étudiés: la compatibilité des objectifs de plein emploi et de stabilité des prix et les relations entre la <b>convention</b> <b>collective</b> et ces objectifs. Part {{three of}} the Report {{of the task force}} on labour relations "focuses on the difficulty Canada has had in attempting to achieve full employment and stable prices simultaneously, and on the relationship of collective bargaining to that problem". With respect to the first question, the Report does not adequately emphasize the overwhelming importance of external factors in the movement of Canadian prices. In an open economy under fixed exchange rates, the trade-off is not really between full employment and price stability, but more likely between full employment and balance of payments equilibrium. Given this externally determined constraint, one of the most valid courses of action for Canadian economic policy is to seek to alleviate the discriminatory effects of inflation on individuals. The Report does not reach definite conclusions regarding the relationship between collective bargaining and the double objective of full employment and price stability. In that respect, it is merely a reflection of the state of economic knowledge. The authors could however be criticized for not having set out the various questions raised within the framework of an analytical model. While accurate measurement of policy effects is always hard to obtain, Phillips' curves, or better for Canada, trade-off curves between balance of payments surpluses and unemployment rates could have been relied upon as an appropriate framework for assessing the effects of alternative policies. Also evident in the report is the tendency to adopt the commentary approach {{at the expense of the}} more useful approach of economic analysis. A case in point is the discussion of wage parity between Canada and the U. S. A.  : not even elementary analytical tools are brought in...|$|E

Collective agreements analyses aim at presenting, {{usually in}} a statistical form, a systematic picture of benefits and working conditions which are found in collective agreements of a given sector. Individuals involved in the collective bargaining process who are using the data contained in contract analyses publications should observe caution when drawing conclusions with the data. It {{is important to note}} that labour contracts do not necessarily contain all agreements concluded by the parties; furthermore, the breakdown of their content into categories of clauses makes more difficult the interpretation of the benefits and working conditions as far as the proper content of the collective agreement isconcerned. All users of the data should also be aware that the systematicand concise form of presentation of the information requires decisions from theanalyst, which can determine to a certain extent the contents of the tables. Publications usually report on the number and percent of agreements containingindividual provisions and the number and percent of employees covered by these agreements. Contracts are chosen according to varying sampling criteria. While some analyses are comprehensive studies of provisions found in agreements, others cover a choice of provisions sometimes selected after consultation with the parties to collective bargaining. The updating of these studies is desirable in order to maintain their usefulness. The need for precise and actual information on the contents of collective agreements in the Federal Public Service induced the Pay Research Bureau to undertake the analysis of several provisions in Federal Public Service collective agreements. All agreements were analysed and the analysis was designed to reflect the context of the Federal Public Service. Here are the salient features of the study: the first part is a statistical analysis of several clauses which indicates the variations of these clauses contained in the agreements; most agreements are identified with a proper abbreviation; part two of the analysis gives the wording of several clauses grouped in different sections and compares the wording of these clauses within each section; again, the agreements in which the clauses are to be found are listed below each clause. A list of units analysed precedes the analysis, giving for each bargaining unit the category, the employer, the bargaining agent, the number of employees and the term of the agreement analysed in the document. Most bargaining units in the list are identified with a proper abbreviation. The analysis of Federal Public Service collective agreements will improve with time.

40|$|L'objet de cet article est d'étendre l'analyse déjà disponible de certaines clauses de <b>convention</b> <b>collective</b> à l'ensemble des clauses non salariales de celles-ci. This article {{presents}} a quantitative {{analysis of the}} importance of non-wage clauses in collective agreements and the conditions governing them. The study is based on 19 industries in Quebec's manufacturing sector, including 2192 collective agreements signed between January lst 1979 and April 15 th 1982. A method of measurement of collective agreement content developed by Gerhart (1976) is used. The variety of non-wage clauses as well as the basically conflictual nature of collective negotiations require the definition of a lowest common denominator. For present purposes what has been retained is: the reduction of management rights and prerogatives. Out of a total of 214 clauses, 126 were selected as directly relevant to this study and subsequently codified on a graded scale according to negative impact on management rights. Provision has also been made for analysis of the multidimensional nature of union objectives during negotiations, through a definition of sub-indices from clauses related to employment, income and unions rights issues. The results reveal statistically significant interindustry differences in the nonwage content of collective agreements, both for the general index as well as each of its components. In general, the development of non-wage clauses tends to be greater in heavy than in light industries. The traditional model of wage determination under collective bargaining is then used to analyse the determinants of non-wage clauses. Table 3 shows the normalised coefficients of the model, estimated by OLS regression analysis. These results suggest that the non-wage content of collective agreements is determined mainly by economic variables related to production technology and ability to pay. The latter factor, measured by profits value of shipments and productivity, clearly has a positive impact on the extent management-rights reduction through collective bargaining. A labor intensive technology also contributes positively to the development of non-wage clauses; however, as expected, this impact is mitigated by a high elasticily of substitution of capital for labor. The regression results are less clear with respect to institutional factors. Trade union density has a significant negative coefficient contrary to expectations. However, union policy as reflected in union affiliation appears to {{have a significant impact on}} non-wage clauses taken as a whole, or more specifically related to employment issues...|$|E
40|$|Cet article traite de l'utilisation de la <b>convention</b> <b>collective</b> en tant qu'outil d'intervention en matière de santé au travailThis study {{deals with}} the {{effectiveness}} of the collective agreement as a means of intervention in questions of occupational health. The first part of the study briefly situates the question of occupational health in historical and present perspectives. The possibility of inserting preventive measures in collective agreements is then treated, followed by the elaboration of research objectives. The potential impact of the collective agreement on occupational health is limited by several factors. Nevertheless, the successes registered through them seem significant to concrete action in the workplace, and have been repeatedly and will probably continue to be used. The task at hand, therefore, is to analyse the degree of success achieved. The study's sample included 491 collective agreements negotiated in the following sectors: manufacturing, mining and forest products. The contents of the collective agreements were analyzed by type of provision. Most frequent were references to participatory bodies (joint or otherwise) governing protective equipment and compensation. Second in importance were references to health services, information, the right of refusal, and inspection. Provisions on training and rehabilitation are less frequent, while. those on research are almost non-existent. Each classification is clearly defined, and statistical tables are provided on several points. The interpretation of results is subdivised into two parts:— The information available reveals a definite general interest of the bargaining partners regarding occupational health. Thus, approximately 80 % of the collective agreements contained at least one pertinent provision. — This overall interest, however, must be clearly distinguished from its effectiveness in practice. As regards the second part, several points are dealt with:— In order to provide meaningful protection in the areas of prevention and compensation, the relevant provisions must be as encompassing as possible. In fact, {{less than half of the}} collective agreements even approach this criteria. — The practical impact of the relevant provisions, based on their precision, varies a great deal from one agreement to the next. — Taken quantitatively, the relevant provisions are more oriented toward compensation than prevention, such as research, information and training. In view of such results, it should be recognized that Law 17 (Loi sur la santé et la sécurité au travail), if properly applied, will permit a greater number of workers to benefit from the rights and remedial structures contained presently in a limited number of collective agreements. — On the other hand, the results of this study should not be considered purely in quantitative terms. In several cases, provisions of less general impact were revealed to be very effective from the point of view of concrete applications of the collective agreement. The development of preoccupations with occupational health in collective agreements is considered in the folio wing two ways: the increase in the use of provisions concerning occupational health over the years, as well as the impact of recent provincial legislation on occupational health and safety. In conclusion, the limits of the collective agreement, as practised in our industrial relations System, are evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Le rattachement de l'accréditation et de la <b>convention</b> <b>collective</b> à l'entreprise préserve assez efficacement le pouvoir de représentation de l'association de salariés et, le cas échéant, le régime collectif de travail établi avec le {{concours}} de cette dernière. Section 36 of the Quebec Labour Code, R. S. Q., 1964, ch. 141, basically {{states that}} the alienation or operation of an undertaking shall not invalide certification or the collective agreement (nor any proceeding {{for the security of}} either or the carrying out of the agreement). Thus, to a certain extent, the association of employees is being protected from changes affecting the undertaking. The individual employee's conditions of employment embodied in the agreement are preserved, as is the employment itself, through the effects of seniority, if recognized by the agreement. This statutory solution of continuity is automatically brought into play by a change of employer in the undertaking. This change, however, must not be such as to allow the undertaking to disappear. THE PERMANENCY OF THE UNDERTAKINGThe new employer is bound by the certificate or the collective agreement, notwithstanding the division, amalgation or changed legal structure of the undertaking. The same undertaking is meant to continue, in whole or in part. In practice, all depends on the definition of the undertaking retained by the Board. Here, one would advocate a notion of « undertaking » centered on the occupational categories mentioned explicitely or implicitely in the certificate and which are referred to in the main provisions of the agreement. This approach would be in accordance with the subject-matter. It would also lead to a liberal application of Section 36. Certification and the collective agreement are defined in terms of general occupational categories and are concerned with future as well as present employees that fall or will eventually fall within these general terms. In this matter, the identity of the employees is immaterial, and so is, as such, the economic end-product of the undertaking. While the presence of the same individual employees, the identity of equipment, of production techniques, are important indications, it not should prevent the conclusion that an undertaking is being alienated or operated by another every time an employer entrusts work pertaining to the occupational categories of the certificate or the agreement. In most of twenty or so decisions involving section 36, the Board has on the the whole preferred to this « occupational approach », a search for an undertaking conceived as a physical structure of production. Substantial continuity of an undertaking in these decisions is found to be continent on elements such as : the individual employees, the equipment, the end-product. [...] If, in this light, the undertaking has been carefully distinguished from the physical assets it includes, on the other hand, considerations revolving around changes in the economic finality of the undertaking have resulted in decisions that appear incompatible with the subject-matter, {{as well as with the}} aim of Section 36. The Board's attitude with respect to the presence of the individual employees has not been absolutely consistent. In the Empire Maintenance case, for instance, Section 36 was given full effect — rightly so, one would be inclined to say — even though it did not appear that former employers were being employed by the new employer. In other instances, the absence of the greater number of the former employees is seen to combine in preventing the play of Section 36 with that of the other elements contained in this rather physical notion of « undertaking ». CHANGE IN THE UNDERTAKINGThe alienation or concession of the undertaking, in whole or in part, results in a new employer owning the latter. Various question concerned with ways of substituting employers are examined according to the working of Section 36. It is namely contended contrary to some of the Board's recent decision, that the transfer must not necessarily be consequent to an agreement between the former and the new employer...|$|E

40|$|Voici une étude préparée au sujet d'un cas particulier qui apporte, dans une large mesure, une réponse d'ordre général à une {{question}} de grande importance théorique et pratique : la mise-à-pied met-elle fin à l'emploi ? L'auteur, après avoir reconstitué {{les faits}} et exposé la position de l'employeur et du syndicat concernés, donne son opinion à la lumière du droit commun, du droit statutaire et de la <b>convention</b> <b>collective</b> particulière. Last winter 1955 - 56, a company considerably reduced its production and personnel {{because of a}} scarcity of hydroelectric power. At rehiring time, the employer pretended it was {{under no obligation to}} deduct the union dues of the organized workers returning from the lay-off, unless each one signed a new formula of authorization. The company attitude is based mostly on its interpretation of a clause of the labour agreement which it has signed. The text mentions that such an authorization for check-off shall cease to have any force and effect "from and after the date upon which the employee is separated from the company for any cause whatsoever". The union, on the other hand, alleges that such a decision by the company constitutes a violation of the labour agreement, those formulas of authorization which have been signed previously being still valid. To prove this, the union refers to the clauses of the Appendix of the labour contract which contains the "Regulations governing the status of employees and the computation of their continuous service". One clause reads : : "After an employee's authorized absence has last one (1) year and extension beyond the year has not been granted in writing, his employment shall be terminated as of the end of such year". The company asserts that for check-off purposes, "termination of employment" means that the individual involved is no more on the job and that his name does not appear any more on the payroll; it concedes, however, that a laidoff employee is entitled to paid holidays and to unemployment insurance benefits. The problem is to determine whether, in the case of employees laid off and taken back to their work thereafter, there is employment termination. The current use of the expression "to be at the employ of" someone means to work for him, to be at his service and to have an individual labour contract with him; this meaning seems to be more enlightening to us than the other classical definitions we can find in any good dictionaries. But does the interruption of work necessarily involve a break of the labour contract? In certain cases, some authors pretend that there is no real break, but simply a suspension of the execution of the contract; this distinction might lead to a solution. There is only one possible cause for the break of the labour contract {{and it seems to be}} one of superior force: an act of God. But to be of superior force, the event would have to be unexpected, irresistible [...] . Now; in the case of this company, it is doubtful that the argument applies; indeed the scarcity of water and of hydro-electric power had been foreseen some months previously. Moreover, the reduction of personnel did not bring the breaking of all relations between the employer and the laid-off employees. As we seem to find a real and complete solution to the problem neither in the common law, nor in the labour law proper, we shall consider the interpretation of the collective labour agreement. But does this contract anywhere give a definition of the termination of employment? We can find it at the eppendix entitled "Regulations governing the status of employees and the computation of their continuous service", at article 13 : "After an employee's authorized absence has lasted one (1) year and extension beyond the year has not been granted in writing, his employment shall be terminated as of the end of such year". But if we interpret all by itself this other text of the contract, (69) "the Company recognizes that a grievance involving one (1) or more former employees who have been laid-off or discharged from the works [...] . " we would think that a lay-off or dismissal terminates employment, because we are then dealing with "former employees". But as we have to study the agreement as a whole, we have to take into account the other clause given above and which is more complete and more accurate. The termination of employment must be considered as the cessation of all employer-employee relations stipulated by contract. Now, the employees which have been laid off here and which came back to work within the twelve subsequent months maintain their status as members of the personnel; they are still related to the enterprise by their seniority rights, the presence of their name on the recall list, and finally the maintenance of their insurance and pension funds. Besides, the employment office of the company promised all workers who had one year or more of service that they would go back to their former job as soon as the company would become active again. Again, the argument used by the company concerning its past normal policies regarding the deduction of union dues which used to be revocable at any time, is not relevant since the formula of authorization for deductions is irrevocable for the duration of the agreement. In conclusion, the author is of the opinion that the company should have deducted unions dues from the salary of the re-employed workers who had already signed such formula of authorization before their lay-off...|$|E
40|$|L'auteur examine l'expérience de {{relations}} du travail vécue par {{les parties}} après qu'une décision arbitrale eut impose une première <b>convention</b> <b>collective.</b> First contract arbitration was initiated in British Columbia in 1973. It {{is a form}} of interest arbitration designed to resolve a dispute {{in the case of the}} negotiation of a first agreement. The basic idea is to assist in the intervention of a third party (either a labour board or a single arbitrator) in a bargaining process characterized by a union recognition conflict. In essence, therefore, it is an exceptional device. Quebec followed BC in adopting in 1977 first contract arbitration provisions. The objective of this paper is to present the labour relations experience of the parties after a first agreement has been imposed. But first let us briefly describe this device. The Law Adopted in December 1977, amendments to the Quebec Labour Code included first contract arbitration provisions which would come into force on February 1, 1978. Any party to a first negotiation can ask the Minister of Labour in writing to refer the dispute to a tripartite arbitration board. Such a request must be made after conciliation has failed. The first duty of the arbitration board is not to impose an agreement on the parties. A period of mediation must first be completed. It is only when the board concludes that negotiations have not been attempted in good faith, and within reasonable delays, that it may decide to determine the content of the first agreement. The Board then informs the parties and the Minister. In determining the content of the agreement, the Board is bound by any provisions agreed upon by the parties. The Board hears the parties and has the power of a judge of the Superior Court. In deciding over working conditions, the Board may take into account such conditions in similar firms or circumstances. Once the decision is made to render an agreement, any strike or lock-out must cease. The length of such an agreement can be of not less than one year and not more than two years. Two main modifications were made in 1983. First the dispute is no longer referred by the Minister of Labour to a tripartite arbitration board, but to a single arbitrator assisted by two assessors. Second, good faith is no longer the criterion for the arbitrator's decision to impose an agreement. Now he can make such a decision when he thinks it improbable that the parties will corne to an agreement in a reasonable delay. MethodologyandResultsBetween February 1, 1978 and December 31, 1984, 376 requests were made to the Minister of Labour. 205 of those requests were accepted (54. 5 %); 165 were refused (43. 8 %) and six were under consideration at the time those data were compiled (1. 5 %). 85. 6 % of these requests came from unions, 13. 5 % from employers and 1. 3 % from both. In only 19. 1 % of these cases was there a strike or lock-out. The fact that 205 cases were referred to arbitration by the Minister of Labour does not mean that 205 agreements were rendered. Only 88 arbitration awards were actually rendered, because in 63 cases the parties signed an agreement before the arbitration board had completed its work. In 12 cases, the Board decided to intervene. Union certification was cancelled in 8 cases, and the union withdrew its request in 13 others. There were also 8 plant closings and, in one case, the arbitrator declared himself without jurisdiction. All 88 cases where an award was rendered were included in this study. A structured questionnaire was administered by telephone. The parties were reached in 72 of the 88 cases (81. 8 %). In 49 of these 72 cases, the rendered agreement had not get come up for renewal. 16 awards were still in force, bargaining was underway in 4 cases, union certifications were revoked or in the process of cancellation in 16 cases, and there were 10 plant shutdowns. These figures suggest that in 22 of the 88 cases, nothing followed the rendering of a first agreement. The main results of this research are the following:— Only one third of the arbitration boards also acted as mediators throughout the process. — In the large majority of cases, the arbitration board did not enforce the entire collective agreement, but only certain provisions such as wages, hours of work and seniority, to mention the most important. — In 23 cases, the agreement was renewed at least once. Let us note that 5 cases had experienced 2 renewals of their collective agreement and in 4 cases there had been three such renewals. — On these 23 cases where at least one renewal of agreement was signed, 17 never used the conciliation, mediation or arbitration services of the Ministry of Labour. — In total, there was 36 renewals of agreement. Only four strikes occurred and there were no lock-outs. — Bargaining for renewal was relatively expeditive. In only 8 cases was 4 months or more necessary, and in 12 cases it took less than a month. — Nearly half the firms have seen grievances brought to arbitration. For these, between one and five grievances were arbitrated. — The major disagreement during renewal bargaining was over wages (26 out of 36 cases). — A comparison of the contents of first agreements and freely bargained agreements suggests that arbitrators are more conservative on monetary provisions and as liberal on non-monetary issues. One exception must be noted: the length of the agreement is longer for freely bargained than for enforced contracts. — The labour climate was assessed by respondents in 26 of the renewals. Management described it as from good to excellent in 24 cases, while unions shared this view in only 14 cases. Both agree, however that the climate has improved over time and that they have learned to speak to one another and to come to agreements. ConclusionStable relations characterized the majority of the cases in Quebec where a first agreement was rendered.

NATURE AND EVOLUTION OF COLLECTIVE BARGAININGThe {{practice of}} collective bargaining performed {{on a private}} and contractual basis surely constitutes {{one of the main}} characteristics of our present industrial relations system. This is true both for Canada and the United States according {{to the fact that the}} same «pattern », to a large extent, applies in both countries. This « contractual » or « private » character of our collective bargaining system is not determined solely by the « capitalistic » régime of our economy, nor is it exclusively a consequence of the pragmatic philosophy of our labour movement coupled with the viguor of our private law. Instead, it merely reflects, in our opinion, die traditionnally dynamic nature of the North American economy of which we are part. Our economy can still afford tolerating a certain amount of freedom in private economic decisions and competition on the labour market may take place in a measure sufficient to enable a « private » system of collective bargaining to work successfully. In spite of repeated criticisms, collective bargaining has assumed new dimensions unthought of some thirty years ago; so much so, that we may now pretend without risk of being refuted, that it really constitutes the core of the whole industrial relations system of ours. What originally was a mere compromise concerning a few items of negotiations has now become the device « par excellence » through which the labour force, not only secures the promotion of its economic interests, but also acquires a new and unproved status in our economic society. This new role of collective bargaining has been assumed progressively from the moment when trade-unionism, taking advantage of new texts of law emanating from public authorities short before the last World War, has revised its structural, functionnal and ideological positions. Union demands were no longer limited to wages and conditions of work, but covered a host of subjects heretofore considered as the exclusive prerogatives of management. Accordingly, the scope of collective bargaining was enlarged so as to include most of the workers' work-life phases, including social security in and out of the negotiations unit. In a country where social security systems emanating from the State have taken so long to develop, collective bargaining has assumed a pioneer role that is not going to vanish soon. What trade-unions have gained from governments, in other countries, they have in part secured in North America through collective bargaining. No matter the conception one has of the trade-union movement in our country, the facts clearly establish that it is through collective bargaining that workers have secured enlarged social security benefits. Long term collective agreement were relatively new twenty years ago; they are now a current practice. Attempts to solve problems of employment and income security, retirement, illness and hospitalization were not common fifteen years ago as they are today. We assist presently to a proliferation of formulae aiming at the coverage of such risks through collective bargaining. THE IMPACT OF THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESSConsidering that more than one million and a half workers throughout Canada are covered by collective agreements, it is easy to measure the impact of such a device on the standard of living and on the status of wage earning people among the Canadian population. According to a survey conducted by the Department of Labour of Canada in 1960, over 66 % of the labour force in manufacturing industries were covered by collective agreements. In the mining industry (« metal » section) the proportion attained 82 % and was up to 89 % in the « coal » section of the same industry. In Quebec, more particularly, there are presently over two thousand collective agreements in force covering more than three hundred thousand people. Moreover, owing to the strategic concentration of the trade-union membership in the most vital sectors of the economy; and due to the direct impact of the negotiations in large concerns over satellite firms, collective bargaining derives a much larger influence than official statistics show. COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND SOCIAL SECURITY FOR WORKERSCollective bargaining in itself has already contributed largely to the social and economic security of the wage-earners. Now, through what we call « fringe benefits » collective bargaining reaches the heart of the problem of economic and social security' for union members. Twenty years ago, such benefits were largely ignored by the parties to collective bargaining. Presently, they represent something like about 20 % of the average labour costs in industry. Though the expression « fringe benefits » is very inclusive, there is a distinction to be made between benefits representing a mere addition to the labour income and those aiming above all at securing a better security and an improved welfare for workers and their families, without being too closely related to the remuneration of the work done. The latter are mainly to be considered when reference is made to the potentialities of collective bargaining as regards economic security and social welfare. Negotiated systems of retirement benefits, schemes for group life-insurance, accident and illness insurance, hospitalization benefits, guaranteed annual wage systems, supplementary unemployment benefits and like devices are to be counted in the latter group of benefits. They cover the main sources of insecurity for workers on the economic and familial grounds. In 1956, in Canada, according to a survey of the Department of Labour, a little more than 10 % of the existing labour agreements in the manufacturing industry provided for unemployment supplementary benefits or guaranteed employment to a different extent. For the same year (1956) about half the number of existing collective agreements studied by the survey contained clauses concerning life and accident insurance as well as indemnities for hospitalization, medical and chirurgical cares for workers and their families. Near 25 % of these agreements provided for a pension plan with the contribution, in whole or in part, of the employer. THE LIMITATIONS OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING TOWARD SOCIAL WELFAREIn spite of the fact that collective bargaining has already done much toward the social welfare of those covered by it, and irrespective of its spectacular development in this respect since one decade or two, it is unquestionably true that, by its very nature and due to the limited degree of its future expansion, such a device presents built-in limitations that one never must lose sight of. Structural and technical difficulties impose certain limits to the development of collectively bargained social security programs through «private» collective agreements. There must be, for the non-unionized labour force, and to a lesser degree, even for those covered by collective agreements, a specific and decisive intervention of the State in social welfare matters. So long as our industrial relations system remains what it is presently; so long as more than half the labour force stays outside the scope of our «private» collective bargaining institutions; so long as the means of cooperation between organized workers and managements are not improved and enlarged in some institutionalized fashion, it would be pure fancy to pretend that collective bargaining could be the global solution to welfare problems. Larger and more inclusive schemes of a private or public nature have to be deviced, toward which collective bargaining should normally assume a subsidiary function...|$|E

Two basic types are analyzed. The first is those which oblige the employer to state his requirements in official notices, assigning only a secondary role to seniority in granting a position. The second involves those which do not oblige official announcement of requirements, but give priority to seniority {{in the choice of}} a candidate. Grievance arbitrators have often been required to control the application of these two clauses regarding the pertinence of such requirements and methods of evaluation on the one hand, and on the other regarding evaluation based on merit. Requirements generally controlled are personal qualities, experience and academic training. When official notices state « essential » requirements, the grievance arbitrator can verify them only if the union specially mentions them in wording of the grievance. The requirement most often challenged is specifically related work experience. This is generally required in departments dealing with preventive and specialized care. Grievance arbitrator s consider requirement reasonable although it prevents candidates with greater seniority being transferred to other positions. Evaluation based on the candidate's merit differs in relations to whether seniority is a secondary or determining criteria. In the first case, the senior candidate will not obtain a given position unless he has equivalent competence to that of the other junior candidate, or again if no other superior candidate has applied. In the second case, seniority will be the determining factor only if the candidate satisfies all normal job requirements. It is our experience that the more senior among nurses cannot be changed when departemental experience is required, because they cannot satisfy this criteria. That is why this category of employee would be well advised to negotiate clauses in which seniority was the sole criteria in selection, if he really wants to protect seniority. Nevertheless, this approach would only be possible in as far as training periods can be arranged to maintain quality of services...|$|R

Ainsi se pose la question de l'harmonisation de ces règles à celles qui régissent les rapports particuliers entre employeurs, syndicats et salariés. La question est d'autant plus intéressante que ce nouveau Code civil traite directement de la relation de travail et qu'il ne comporte aucune réserve à l'endroit du Code du travail et des conventions collectives. L'arrivée de ce nouveau Code civil imposera une délicate gestion des conflits de droit {{en raison de}} l'inévitable rencontre de ces deux codes, Code civil et Code du travail, et de leur acte respectif, le contrat de travail et la <b>convention</b> <b>collective.</b> Since January 1, 1994, Quebec has had a new Civil Code which, {{in combination}} with the charters of rights, establishes the common law applicable to relations between persons. Thus arises {{the question of how to}} harmonize these rules with those that govern the specifie relations between employers, unions and employees. The question is all the more interesting because this new Civil Code deals directly with the employment relationship without any reference to the Labour Code or to collective agreements. The appearance of this new Civil Code will require delicate management of conflict of laws because of the unavoidable connection between the Civil Code and the Labour Code and their respective instruments, the contract of employment and the collective agreement. The coexistence of the two codes will necessitate a re-examination of several decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada which establish that, where there is a collective agreement in place, there will no longer be room for a contract of employment. The Supreme Court of Canada itself will have to examine this issue and make the necessary distinctions, taking into account the fact that the Civil Code makes no exceptions for the employment relationship and that it now contains 13 articles dealing directly with the contract of employment. The explanation put forward on a few occasions by the Supreme Court to the effect that the collective agreement would be a tripartite contract, will no longer be acceptable. The study of the coexistence of these two codes is all the more interesting owing to the fact that the development of collective labour relations law was meant to preclude certain effects of the rules of civil law which were at the time too favourable towards Syndicat catholique des employes de magasins de Quebec Inc. v. Compagnie Paquet Ltee,[1959] R. C. S. 206;McGavin Toastmaster Udv. Ainscough,[1976] 1 R. C. S. 718;CAIMAWv. Paccar of Canada Ud,[1989] 2 R. C. S. 983. employers or which ignored the situation of employees. Now the new Civil Code lays down a series of rules meant to protect employees through the enforcement of the criteria of equality and good faith. If the contract of employees was to disappear due solely to the presence of a collective agreement, it would follow that the Quebec Civil Code would not apply to these employees, at least for the purposes intended by the Labour Code and the collective agreement. If this were the case, such employees, unions and employers, would, find themselves set aside for the same purposes and roles by the application of the following articles :— Article 2085 C. C. Q. with respect to employee loyalty;— Articles 2089, 2090 and 2095 which stipulate the contractual freedom related to the limite of free competition;— Articles 2091, 2092 and 2094 where ways to resiliate a contract of employees are set out; — Articles 2097 which ensures the survival of the employment relationship following the arrival of a new employer at the helm of the enterprise. The same applies to common law provisions concerning the respect of reputation and privacy of a person (articles 35 to 41 of the C. C. Q.), the interpretation of contracts, articles 1379, 1432, 1435 and 1436 (contract of adhesion) and the requirement of good faith (articles 6 and 7 of the C. C. Q.), etc. It should be immediately stated that it is essential that the harmonization of the rules of law not create a backlash which would allow the contract of employment to serve as a valid legal tool to reduce the real importance of the collective agreement. Furthermore, we maintain that this legitimate and necessary protection of the collective agreement should not in any way override the Quebec Civil Code, the renewed common law, nor should it repudiate the contract of employment. It should be noted that our common law, the civil law of French origin, which is codified in a concise, simple and direct style, is specific to us. It is recognized indirectly by the 1867 Constitution, since it predated the Constitution and this situation was confirmed. Barring a serious legal and political heresy, or shameful laxity, or else recalcitrant judicial imperialism, one cannot act as if our codified common law did not exist or was simply interchangeable with or able to be assimilated to the Common Law. Aside from the very existence of the Labour Code and collective agreements, the specifity of the law of collective labour relations is not so special as to require, suppose or imply that this branch of labour law be removed from the common body of Quebec private law. It should be remembered that labour law, just like its component related to collective labour relations, is concerned with persons (employee and employer), relations between these same persons and the properties to which these relations are directed or which result from these relations. However, these same three aspects are precisely those set out in the preliminary provision of the Quebec Civil Code : "The Civil Code of Quebec, ( [...] .), governs persons, relations between persons, and property". In labour law, it is necessary to be able to draw from a broad and rich source of law in order to use it as a basis for this area of law and to make up for these inevitable gaps, deficiencies or silences. This source and this general framework cannot, for constitutional, political and cultural reasons, be an avowed or hidden common law. As well, only the Civil Code of Quebec can and must serve in this way. Such is the usual legal and political function of the Quebec Civil Code, and this role can only serve to bring closer together the attributes appropriate to law, namely coherence, security, logic, foreseeable nature, etc. If the situation is as described in this paper, then we must learn how to harmonize the law of collective relations with the Civil Code of Quebec. Analyses of the contents of collective agreements confirm our common knowledge that the legal foundations of the basic data of labour relations and the employment relationship are not found there. It would be a matter of :— the presence of the employee, his constraint, his obligations to be available;— his obligation related to discretion and loyalty, etc.;— the employer's power to give orders, to discipline and even to suspend unilaterally the provision of mutual benef its, his obligation to pay a salary, his right of accession, his responsibility towards third parties somehow related to the employee, etc. If employees not covered by collective agreements are subject to the Civil Code of Quebec as codified common law there is no principle or postulate that would allow us to believe that the simple presence of a collective agreement would change this situation. In order to settle any real or apparent conflict over the terms and conditions of employment that derive from these different sources, the two necessary criteria are : public order and the objectively more favourable norm. Furthermore, there are several provisions in the Quebec Civil Code which favour employees and which cannot for whatever reason be ignored because of the existence of a collective agreement. We would also argue that, with the same reservations, the collective agreement would be subject to the Quebec Civil Code. In fact, if this common body of Quebec private law is applicable to persons and relations between persons, then it also applies to the persons and property which are the subject of collective agreements. This means in particular that the collective agreement cannot validly contain clauses that go against the provisions of public order decreed in the Quebec Civil Code (article 62 of the Labour Code) and that other provisions of the Civil Code, in as much as they are compatible, make up for the gaps, innuendos and silences of the collective agreement. Furthermore, the Labour Code sets out several special rules to manage the development of the collective agreement, to specify its contents and its importance. These special and precise rules obviously constitute as many provisions that can be added to and taken out of this same Quebec Civil Code. The sole fact that one would be tempted to use the contract of employment to reduce, violate or destroy the importance of a collective agreement cannot justify such a denial of principle. In reality, of course, employees and employers do not generally negotiate the individual employment contract. Even so, this fiction does not stand in the way of the application of the Civil Code of Quebec to employees covered by collective agreements...|$|E
40|$|L'auteur dégage les principaux traits de la {{nouvelle}} Loi des relations de travail dans l'industrie de la construction au Québec : il n'y aura qu'une seule négociation et une seule <b>convention</b> <b>collective,</b> {{au niveau}} régional ou provincial. La loi vise à assurer plus d'ordre et plus d'unité dans une industrie déchirée par de nombreuses tensions ; l'expérience des négociations de 1969, et bien davantage celle de 1970, ne sont guère encourageantes : jamais décret n'a soulevé autant de difficultés ; et les rivalités intersyndicales demeurent aussi profondes que jamais, surtout en matière de placement et de sécurité d'emploi. Cet article a été préparé en juin 1970 et février 1971. The formula {{and history of}} industry-wide bargaining in the Québec construction industry is a rare if not unique case in North America. LEGAL SYSTEM AND STATUSPrior to a new law enacted December 1968 — The Construction Industry Labour Relations Act, known as Bill 290 — labour relations {{in the construction industry}} had operated under two different laws, the Labour Code, which regulates the general system of certification and collective bargaining at the employer's level, and the Collective Agreement Decrees Act, which provides for the possibility of extending a privately bargained collective agreement to make it, by way of decree, mandatory to all employers and employees of an industry in a definite region. Since 1934, the construction industry in Québec had chosen to operate under this system of juridical extension. From the very beginning, an industry-wide bargaining system was set up juridical by the parties themselves. Fifteen decrees thus determined the conditions of work for all the general trades in as many different areas ; the bargaining for the respective agreements was conducted on an industry-wide basis at the regional level. A few highly specialized trades had provincial agreements and decrees. There were very few instances of certifications ; many of these were used as a protection or a weapon against a rival union, especially in the mechanical trades. Bill 290 has eliminated the double system and placed the construction labour relations under one single Act. At the same time, it purported to centralize even more fully the bargaining process, stating that there will be strictly one bargaining and one agreement by region (or for the whole province, if the parties involved so desired). To ensurecomplete industry-wide bargaining, the certification system was abolished and replaced by a new concept, that of representative associations. Two provincial labour bodies are thus designated in the Act itself, the Confederation of National Trade Unions (C. N. T. U.) and the Québec Federation of Labour (Q. F. L.) with respect to their own affiliates, respectively the national construction syndicates, which are preponderant in the various regions outside of Montréal, and locals of the international building trades unions, more heavily concentrated in the Montréal area and, on a province-wide basis, in some highly technical trades. On the employers' side, five contractors' groups are named to represent management jointly at the bargaining table. The system of juridical extension remains basically as before, with the possibility, now, that the whole agreement may be incorporated in the decree, including union security clauses. The law provides that the agreement and the ensuing decree must contain certain provisions respecting wages, social security and other fringe benefits, union security and check-off, grievance procedures and the like ; it may contain any other clause which is not against the law or public order. Strike or lock-out action is permitted at the expiration of any decree and negotiations must begin at least three months before that date. OBJECTIVES AND IMPLICATIONSBill 290 can be considered as an attempt to bring unity and order in an industry that is deeply divided because of its complex nature : inter-trades, inter-regions and inter-unions conflicts have disrupted construction labour relations more than any other sector of the economy. An industry-wide highly-centralized system is hoped to prevent some of these disruptions. At the same time, it can bring much needed uniformity in trade definitions and qualification requirements. The system is also designed to provide more stability to unions and employers' organizations, the development of which was somewhat hampered by the juridical extension system as it existed since 1934. The formula will bring more power to the designated parties but also increased control over them. A union security clause will make membership in an affiliate of one of the two main labour bodies obligatory for all workers in the industry. Although certain mechanisms are foreseen to ensure freedom of association and the possibility for new groups to be recognized, the power that the designated associations will acquire will be so great that a change may become practically impossible. They will thus appear almost as public organizations and will require heavy controls to protect the individual member and his fondamental rights. The same may be said, with the appropriate qualifications, of the employers' associations. The one bargaining and one agreement principle will also call for more government intervention in the bargaining process itself. The Act foresees the possibility for the Minister to appoint, of his own motion, a conciliation officer {{from the very beginning of}} the negotiations, what he did in 1970. The implications will be so big and far-reaching, especially if the bargaining is conducted at the province level, both for the government as a buyer of construction and for the economy as a whole, that it is almost impossible to imagine that the agreement, mainly its monetary clauses, can be settled without some kind of government intervention. But centralization has also other aspects. A unified system may permit the implementation of portable social security benefits, as well as some kind of seniority provisions, greater job security and the like. APPLICATION AND PROBLEMS : AN HISTORICAL OVERVIEWThe history of the Bill, both before and after its enactment, provides an excellent example of the antagonizing forces of unity and disruption within the industry. Both labour and management had been requesting a review of the legal situation for a long time, especially on the questions of certification and the relationship between the agreement and the decree. A study committee was set up by the Department of Labour in the Summer of 1967. All members of the committee appeared to be in accord on some very basic points : a new certification system was necessary, trade definitions were badly lacking uniformity, apprenticeship regulations and professional jurisdiction had to be revised and inter-union rivalry needed much soothing. But no one knew how some of these points, mainly the last one, could be implemented. In fact, while the committee was pursuing his work, violent confrontations erupted and numerous demonstrations were held. Finally, in December 1968, the government tabled its Bill. It was turned immediately to a parliamentary committee where the parties attacked violently certain parts of the Bill, especially a section which was intended to ban any closed shop agreement and replace the union hiring hall system by a provision imposing on all employers the obligation to hire all workers through Québec Manpower Centres. The provision hurted more directly the international building trades unions since their hiring hall system is more developed and more strongly established than that of the C. N. T. U. syndicates. The opposition was so strong that the proposed section had to be deleted and the whole question was turned back to a joint commission, which was established to study other points that needed to be standardized. Bill 290 was rapidly put to test, since ten decrees were up for renewal in the early part of 1969. The bargaining started at ten different tables, but was quickly reduced to one : the Montréal negotiations became, for all practical purposes, a provincial table. The C. N. T. U. had centered its campaign around the slogan : « Job security through joint employment offices ». Since the Joint Advisory Commission could not reach an agreement on a proposal regarding union hiring halls, while the C. N. T. U. syndicates refused to sign any agreement that would not; contain provisions on this point, a partial agreement was reached between Q. F. L. unions and the employers' organizations at the end of April which was to be applied in the Montréal area. The legality of this agreement may be questioned, but it avoided a strike for the time being. Strike action punctuated with violence developed in some areas of the province during the Summer. An agreement was finally reached in July ; it had to be revised and became the construction decree only at the end of October. The new decree contained, among other points, mandatory union security clauses, together with an engagement by the employers to implement, in the next agreement, wage parity for so-called provincial workers and, for all the other workers, to establish for each area a wage ratio according to its economic situation. As far as the employment security and hiring hall question was concerned, the parties had agreed to refer the problem to an arbitrator if the Joint Advisory Commission could not reach an agreement by the end of November 1969. The Joint Commission did not reach any agreement and Judge Gold had to try and develop a workable system. His recommendations were taken up by an order in council dated April 23, 1970. Construction workers were divided into various categories with different hiring provisions for each : the regular employee of an employer (either a provincial regular who has worked 1500 hours for the same employer or a regional who has worked 800 hours) may be hired directly by the employer himself ; the permanent or professional employee who has worked 800 hours in the industry may be hired either through a Québec Manpower Centre or a union hiring hall ; all the others, who are called reservists, must be hired exclusively through a Québec Manpower Centre. In February 1971, the system is still not ready to operate, since the status of the various employees has not yet been completed. The 1970 negotiations have been particularly difficult. The 1969 decree (and also the five others remaining from the previous system) expired at the end of April 1970. Bargaining had progressed very little when a strike occurred in the Montréal area during the month of May, apparently because of the fear that working conditions would be changed since there was no decree. Workers went back to work after the adoption of Minimum Wage Order No. 12, which ensured that previous working conditions would be maintained, and after the parties had agreed on a job site steward clause at the bargaining table. But in early July, strikes erupted elsewhere in the province ; after a month the government decided to step into the dispute and ordered back the workers to their jobs by special legislation. Bill 38 enjoined the parties to get back to work and to resume negotiations ; if these negotiations failed to produce an agreement within a month, the Committee on Labour and Manpower of the National Assembly would be called to hear the parties ; the Committee convened in late September, early October and November. For all practical purposes, no bargaining took place after the month of August and the decree, which was adopted in late December 1970, was wholly the work of government employees, except for the clauses that had been initialed before the enactment of Bill 38. The new decree has aroused opposition from all parties. The employers reject a too rapid wage parity (to be almost completed by January lst 1973) together with the regrouping of many classifications and regions, which means dramatic wage increases in many cases. The C. N. T. U. says the wage parity is still incomplete and it attacks the government for not forcing a quicker application of the decree. The international building trades unions strongly oppose the job security and employment system. It is hard to foresee whether the forces of unity or of disruption will finally prevail. Bill 290 has tried to impose a highly-centralized industry-wide bargaining structure ; the 1970 experiment has been a near-failure, inasmuch as the present decree had to be imposed on the parties according to the provisions of Bill 38. The employment security and hiring hall problem has not been solved either : will the government decide to impose its views on this question or will it back down to Q. F. L. unions pressure remains to be seen...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{strength}} of commercial broadcastingmedia, public service broadcasting (PSB) {{remains at the}} core of Europe's cultures and economies. Currently, three PSB outlets - BBC, France Television and RAI - lead revenue generation in this growing Europe-wide sector, and lead in terms of audience and cultural influence within all the other media in their respective countries. But PSB's fiscal vigour aside, Europe's emerging new-media landscape, defined by novel moral codes embedded in the programming and innovative forms of interactive production and distribution, is arguably transforming the debate around the principles that sustain public television's legitimacy. Generally associated with social-democratic ideals, PSB's traditional legitimating principles were nonetheless aligned with particular types of morally conservative views. John Reith, the BBC's first director, was arguably the moral programmer of PSB in Europe (Hodkinson, 2011), initially set up to "improve society's knowledge, taste and moral awareness" (cf. Reith's claim in 1924, cited in Hodkinson, p. 285). PSB's enlightened claim to the monopoly of reason and "quality" implied a protection from commercial involvement and competition, and the necessity to achieve a universalised character among the population. Reith's perspective bears an interesting yet complicated relation with the ideas of Pierre Bourdieu (1993; 1996), for whom "quality" is never objective but reflects class divisions, a concern to mitigate the contradiction between the production of democracy and massive dissemination of new meanings throughout market structures. Due to its structural attachment to audience ratings, television is profoundly subject to market pressures, institutionally incapable of progressively affecting the symbolic order of society. Clearly influenced by Bourdieu, the still abiding debate about PSB pivots on "quality" and "market pressures," echoing as well the Habermasian notion of the public sphere, according to which Europe's PSB "has to" aim at informing rational debate. At the same time, proponents of commercial television discursively associated the structural search for "audiences" with a democratic sense of the collective. They portrayed PSB as misaligned with the actual civil sphere, arrogantly imposing undemocratic yet politicized benchmarks of "quality. " PSB's proponents traditionally argue that "commerce," the primary objective of private television, is in itself de-attached from the collective principle of the civil sphere for it promotes a type of programming oriented to short-term individual preferences - escapist forms of entertainment and sensationalist yellow journalism that appeal to negative emotions - and not to long-term goals and processes that foster civil-sphere solidarity. From the emergence in the 1980 s of a dual nature in Europe's television market - "audience" constructed as society, "more rational" vs commercial content - there arose during the 1990 s a new internal language around the material fragmentation of audiences and programmes due to the multiplication of options and channels. This fragmentation and the new organizational language have not disconnected the institution of television from the universalistic character of the civil sphere. But the relationship between the civil sphere and television has indeed changed. We can outline this change along three axes. First, given the redefinition of the internal logic of television production and reception within a new context of technological transformation, de-regulation and market liberation, and of globalization along with audience fragmentation, the post-consensus system is discernible by the creation and legitimation of new televisual forms that transcend the traditional imperative to appeal to the broadest possible "audiences," understood as a commercial and political construct. Second, {{a significant portion of the}} commercial-television industry operates according to an amplified quantitative logic in terms of viewership through overtly exaggerated narratives, judgments and dubious journalistic practices. Third, the Internet and content digitization provide for dispersed, previously "voiceless" agents of the civil sphere with a mass-media production and distribution platform that is potentially more participatory and "grassrooted" (Freedman, 2000). The objective of this paper is to propose a coherent set of theoretical and methodological tools to explain the emerging cultural dynamics of the institution of television in Europe. We wish to illuminate the changing structure of the public vs commercial TV debate through the lens of Alexander's theoretical concept of the civil sphere. Alexander (2006) argues for a sociological theory of the civil sphere defined by its relative autonomy from political and economic interests. At the core of the civil sphere, we find the institutions of communication, which contribute to the collective feelings of solidarity around ideals of community and justice, empathy and integration. Such institutions frame the debate of civil society through discourses and institutions, providing universalistic civil codes for democratic critique, action, reform and also exclusion. The civil sphere operates as a skeletal structure of binary codes for opposed civil and anti-civil human "motives," social "relations" and "institutions," and of corresponding categories: "pure" or "impure," as in "the discourse of liberty" as opposed to "the discourse of repression. " The positive codes represent the "sacred" and the "civic" while their opposites stand for the "profane" and the "anti-civic" insofar as they emerge from extra-civil spheres such as markets, states, sections or parties. In the first part of this paper, we describe Alexander's civil sphere, establishing the study of the debate between public and commercial television as a particular way of encoding the discourse of civil society. In the second part, we use this theoretical framework to examine the discourses appearing in both mainstream and alternative Spanish media in regard to crucial events in Spanish PSB's limelight: the audio-visual sector reform proposed by the Government in June 2005, the intent of the Board of Directors of RTVE to control the news in September 2011, and the recent announcement by the government to reduce state funding to RTVE. This empirical investigation suggests that the emerging forms of discursive legitimation of both private and public television are now mediated by both the civil sphere and "civil television," signified and materialized by the Internet. Both private and public television try to associate with these cultural structures, in a process that is condensed in the emergence of a new concept of "audience" which is not based on rationalistic principles of taste but on the generation of collective expectations as a cultural experience per se. Public television's renewal may thus emerge in the convergence of the commercial, the public and the civil. La télévision publique, commerciale et civile dans le paysage européen des nouveaux médias Malgré la force croissante des médias commerciaux, les services publics de l'audiovisuel (PSB) restent au cœur de la culture et de l'économie en Europe. Actuellement, trois de ces chaînes publiques - BBC, France Télévisions et la RAI - génèrent des revenus conséquents dans ce secteur en pleine croissance à l'échelle européenne, et entraînent, notamment grâce à leurs audiences, une influence culturelle indiscutable dans chacun de ces pays. Mais la loi fiscale entrée en vigueur, l'émergence des nouveaux médias et les formes innovantes de production interactive et de distribution posent avant tout le débat de la légitimité de la télévision publique et des principes qui la sous-tendent. Généralement associé à des idéaux sociaux-démocrates, le service public traditionnel a souvent été le fruit d'une politique conservatrice et morale. John Reith, premier directeur de la BBC, a été sans doute le créateur de ce service public en Europe (Hodkinson, 2011), qu'il avait initialement mis en place pour "améliorer la connaissance de la société, le goût et la conscience morale" (cf. Reith, en 1924, cité dans Hodkinson, p. 285). Le rayonnement du service public se réclamant du monopole de la raison et de la "qualité", il devient une protection contre la récupération commerciale et contre la concurrence, et participe de la nécessité de construire un portrait-type de la population, dans lequel tout le monde puisse se reconnaître. La perspective de Reith porte un regard intéressant sur les idées de Pierre Bourdieu (1993, 1996), pour qui la "qualité" n'est jamais objective mais reflète les divisions de classe, dans un souci d'atténuer la contradiction entre la production de la démocratie et la diffusion massive de nouvelles significations à travers les structures du marché. En raison de son attachement à la structure d'audience, la télévision est profondément soumise aux pressions du marché, et institutionnellement incapable d'affecter progressivement l'ordre symbolique de la société. Clairement influencé par Pierre Bourdieu, le débat reste centré sur le service public, la "qualité" et "les pressions du marché", faisant ainsi écho à la notion habermassienne de la sphère publique, selon laquelle le service public de l'Europe doit viser à éclairer le débat rationnel. Dans le même temps, les promoteurs de la télévision commerciale sont discursivement associés à la recherche de structure pour " le public " avec un sens démocratique de la <b>convention</b> <b>collective.</b> Ils ont dépeint le service public tel qu'une structure mal alignée avec la sphère civile réelle, imposant des repères qualitatifs avec une arrogance assez antidémocratique. Les partisans du service public soutiennent traditionnellement que le "commerce", l'objectif principal de la télévision privée, est attaché en soi au principe de collectivité de la sphère civile. Elle est destinée à favoriser un type de programmation orienté à court terme selon les préférences individuelles - les formes d'évasion de divertissement et de sensationnalisme journalistique qui font appel à des émotions négatives - et non pas à long terme selon des objectifs et des processus qui favorisent la sphère civile de solidarité. Depuis l'émergence dans les années 1980 au sein du marché télévisuel européen d'une certain dualité entre l'"audience" telle qu'elle est construite par la société et le contenu commercial, il se développe pendant les années 1990 une nouvelle forme de langage orientée autour de la fragmentation matérielle des audiences et des programmes, dû à la multiplication des de l'offre et des chaînes. Cette fragmentation et le nouveau langage organisationnel n'ont pas déconnecté la télévision en tant qu'institution de l'universel portrait-type de la sphère civile. Mais la relation entre la sphère civile et la télévision a incontestablement changé. Nous pouvons expliquer ce changement selon trois axes distincts. Premièrement, étant donné la redéfinition de la logique interne de la production télévisuelle, sa réception dans un nouveau contexte de transformation technologique, la déréglementation et la libéralisation du marché, la mondialisation, ainsi que la fragmentation des auditoires, le système post-consensus est perceptible par la création et la légitimation de nouvelles formes télévisuelles qui transcendent l'impératif traditionnel et qui appellent au public le plus large possible qui doit être compris comme une construction commerciale et politique. Deuxièmement, une partie importante de l'industrie commerciale de la télévision fonctionne selon une logique quantitative amplifiée en termes de téléspectateurs, à travers des récits ouvertement exagérés, mais aussi des jugements et des pratiques journalistiques douteuses. Troisièmement, la numérisation et le développement du contenu Internet ont fourni à des agents de la sphère civile auparavant "sans voix" un accès à l'information grâce à des plateformes de distribution qui sont potentiellement plus participatives et terre à terre (Freedman, 2000). L'objectif de ce papier est de proposer un ensemble cohérent d'outils théoriques et méthodologiques pour expliquer la dynamique culturelle naissante de la télévision institutionnelle en Europe. Nous souhaitons mettre en lumière la structure changeante du débat public face à la télévision commerciale, à travers la lentille du concept théorique de la sphère civile selon Alexandre. Alexandre (2006) plaide en faveur d'une théorie sociologique de la sphère civile définie par son autonomie par rapport aux intérêts politiques et économiques. Au cœur de la sphère civile, on trouve des institutions de communication, qui contribuent aux sentiments collectifs de solidarité autour des idéaux de communauté et de justice, et qui favorisent l'empathie et l'intégration. Ces institutions permettent de recadrer le débat de la société civile à travers les discours et les institutions, fournissant à la critique démocratique des codes civils universels. La sphère civile fonctionne comme une structure squelettique de codes binaires qui opposent les motivations civilisées aux non-civilisées, le relations" sociales " aux "institutions", et leurs catégories correspondantes : "pur" ou "impur", comme dans "le discours de la liberté "plutôt que" le discours de la répression ". Les codes positifs représentent le" sacré "et le" civique ", tandis que leurs opposés représentent le" profane "et l'" anticivique "dans la mesure où ils émergent de domaines extra-civils tels que les marchés, les Etats, les sections ou les partis. Dans la première partie de cet article, nous décrivons la sphère civile d'Alexandre, et établissons un débat entre la télévision publique et commerciale en étudiant l'encodage du discours de la société civile. Dans la seconde partie, nous utilisons ce cadre théorique pour examiner les discours apparaissant dans les deux grands médias de service public espagnols ainsi que dans les médias alternatifs. Nous nous focaliserons sur les évènements qui ont été dans le feu des projecteurs des médias espagnols: la réforme du secteur audiovisuel proposé par le gouvernement en Juin 2005, l'intention du conseil d'administration de la RTVE de contrôler l'information en Septembre 2011, et l'annonce récente par le gouvernement de la réduction du financement public à la RTVE. Cette étude empirique suggère que les formes émergentes de légitimation discursive des télévisions publique et privée sont désormais inspirées à la fois par la sphère civile et par la "télévision publique", comme on peut l'observer grâce au phénomène de l'internet. Les formes privées et publiques de télévision tentent de s'associer à ces structures culturelles, selon un processus qui se condense dans l'émergence d'un nouveau concept de "public" qui n'est pas basé sur des principes rationnels de goût, mais sur la génération d'attentes collectives comme expérience culturelle. Le renouvellement de la télévision publique peut donc émerger dans la convergence de la publicité, du public et du civil...|$|E

INTRODUCTIONIn {{discussing}} seniority provisions, one may {{be exposed}} to making rather serious mistakes in taking a wrong or too restrictive approach to the subject. It {{would be wrong to}} isolate seniority provisions from the collective agreements of which they are such an important part, and treat them like some kind of suspended and rootless concepts ; and it would be equally wrong to isolate these collective agreements at least from some aspects of the environment (institutional, social, economic, etc.) within which they apply. In this article, some comments will be made regarding collective agreements in Canada, in descriptive as well as in purely statistical terms. Secondly, seniority provisions will be dealt with in the same way : their substance will be discussed as well as their incidence. THE IMPORTANCE OF COLLECTIVE AGREEMENTSA suggested definition of the collective agreementLet us take collective agreements first. When one speaks of the importance of collective agreements in Canada, one can think of several reasons that can justify such a statement. The first such reason might well perhaps be {{the very nature of the}} agreement itself. What is a collective agreement ? Personally, we would compare it to« a private law which, for a given period of time, lays down the working conditions for a group of employees, a group which in more legal terms is called a bargaining unit. That is to say that for the duration of the collective agreement, conditions set forth therein may not be modified by either party unless both parties, by mutual agreement, decide otherwise. We wish to add also that the collective agreement includes a grievance procedure which provides for the examination of complaints arising from alleged violations or supposedly erroneous interpretations of the clauses of the collective agreement ; we emphasize : the purpose of the grievance procedure is not to amend the clauses of the collective agreement, but to examine grievances concerning the application of the collective agreement, such grievances in no way constituting demands for modification of the agreement » 1. Some figures regarding number of employees under collective agreementsA second reason why collective agreements ought to be considered as very important documents in our national life, would of course be the high proportion of employees covered by these agreements in a number of major Canadian industries or occupational sectors. The following few figures are taken from the Department of Labour's report onWorking Conditions in Canadian Industry for the year 1966  : close to 70 % of employees, excluding office employees, in the very diverse manufacturing industry were covered by collective agreements. If we examine this industry by sector, we note that the proportion of workers under agreements amounted to 96 % in pulp and paper, to 98 % in tire manufacturing; in the key railway sector, 96 % of the travelling personnel are under collective agreements ; of course such percentage are not typical of all cases, far from it; however, the sectors which have just been enumerated are important. We might also point out that the estimated number of employees, in a very wide range of occupations indeed, covered by collective agreements in Canada is in the vicinity of 1, 900, 000 2 — an estimate for which we wish to take responsibility. The content of the collective agreementA third reason why collective agreements are important is their very substance. We have stated on a previous occasion that in our largely unplanned economic and social system, very many matters are left to the parties to collective bargaining to decide, while in other countries with a planned or less planned system, many of these matters are covery by legislation. What are some of these matters contained in our collective agreements ? Vacations, paid sick leave, job evaluation systems, education al leave, training or retraining provisions, seniority rules, etc [...] [...] to cite but a few. The impact of the environment on collective agreementsHaving said this, one must also point out that our labour relations system, being based primarily on the local employee — management relationship places the parties to collective bargaining and their collective agreements very close to local problems and also close to the community within which the collective agreement is applied. In other and perhaps more simple words, the parties to collective bargaining in this country are generally close to the anxieties, frustrations, aspirations and traditions of those to whom collective agreements apply. A few examples might perhaps be in order here. Community traditions may have an impact on the number of paid holidays provided for in collective agreements. Strongly family-oriented traditions may have an impact on the kind of paid bereavement leave provisions that are introduced in the agreement : in some instances, some of our agreement analysts, we clearly recall, have noted that the benefits provided under this type of provision tend to be more generous in the Province of Québec than in the Province of Ontario. It can also be speculated that strong family orientations might even have an impact on the type of seniority provisions that are introduced in the agreement : some seniority provisions, in dealing with promotions and layoffs, will take into consideration such factors as the number of dependents, as well as length of service and ability, when considering employees for promotion or retention. Another example. A community which for a long time may have frowned upon the employment of women in industrial occupations will not likely provide strong encouragement to the parties to collective bargaining to introduce a maternity leave provision in their agreement. And as an indication that social pressures might have an impact on the employee relations process, would it be unrealistic to assume that certain community attitudes might put a degree of pressure on the parties to collective bargaining so that the benefits provided under a maternity leave provision would be offered to married mothers only ?In addition to the broad social and cultural environment, the very type of activity which is engaged in, in the establishment where the agreement applies is also going to have an impact on the content of the agreement. For example, because of the nature of the work performed in an occupational sector, safety provisions may be more frequent in that sector than in another. One can also speculate that in plants and offices that include highly specialized or differentiated occupations, seniority provisions might be, in certain areas, implemented on an occupational basis rather than on a wider basis. The impact of collective agreements on the environmentBefore turning to seniority provisions more specifically, we would want to make one final observation. Indeed in what has just been stated, the impression might have been conveyed that in relation to their environment, collective agreements are simply reflecting environmental conditions, and adjusting to environ-mental changes. If this is the impression that the previous observations have conveyed, it should be firmly stated that such is not our view. For it can be said that collective agreements, by adjusting to environmental and other changes, may obviously facilitate and accelerate change and thereforecontribute to change, and they may generate other changes in turn. Again, perhaps an example would be in order. A useful degree of awareness has been generated regarding problems that technological change and automation may present to employees and to management. More specifically, there is, I believe, a well developed awareness that the introduction of changes in technology may require new or up-dated skills, and new knowledge. Then, when in a context of changes in technology, the collective agreement provides that a training or retraining program will be offered to employees, with the financial support of the company, is it not true that this particular program might in fact do more than narrowly respond to a new educational requirement that has resulted from a changing technology in a particular office or establishment? It is our view that in fact that program may represent a new venture and a new experiment in adult education and adaptability, and in adult training ; it may generate new attitudes on the part of employees towards education, and it may well encourage management and employees' organizationselsewhere to take similar steps in an effort not only to adjust to change, but to facilitate change and progress 3. Other examples could be offered that would also suggest that collective agreements are not only subjected to environmental factors and forces, but do generate changes also. SENIORITY PROVISIONSLet us, then, turn to seniority and seniority provisions, and emphasize that our experience has been in the analysis of seniority provisions, not in their negotiation. Major aspects of seniority provisions will be examined in this article. It may be that to those who have had practical experience in dealing with seniority provisions at the bargaining table, our treatment of such provisions may appear too rigid or too theoretical. That might well be. It will be pointed out, however, that these concepts should be considered as tools of analysis, and that as such they have proven to be very useful in our work in the Federal Department of Labour. Some figures concerning the incidence of seniority provisions in collective agreementsAt the outset it might be of interest to know that in our major study on Collective Agreements Provisions in Major Manufacturing Establishments, that we released in 1964, 90 % of the establishments surveyed (non-office workers) had seniority provisions on promotions of employees, and that in 97 % of the establishments surveyed, there was a seniority provision on lay-offs. In a more recent study onProvisions in Collective Agreements covering office employees in Canadian manufacturing industries (1967), 86 % of the agreements studied had a provision regarding seniority on promotion, while 97 % of the agreements examined had a provision regarding seniority on lay-off. So much for the incidence of some of the most important seniority provisions ; it should perhaps be emphasized that these data are for the manufacturing sector only. However, our definite impression is that the figures just quoted represent a fairly accurate picture of the incidence of seniority provisions in a number of Canadian industrial and occupational sectors. Let us now turn to the substance of seniority provisions and proceed somewhat systematically with various concepts. 1. We would broadly define seniority as the status acquired by an employee at his (her) place of employment through his (her) length of service. This definition, at brief as it is, raises some questions on our minds. It will be understood that only some of these questions can be raised here. How is seniority acquired ? How is it lost ? For example, is an employee going to accumulate seniority starting with his (her) first day of employment with the company, or is he (she) going to start accumulating seniority once he (she) has successfully completed his (her) probationary period ? Once the employee's probationary period is successfully completed, is the length of this period going to be credited to the employee in terms of seniority ? What happens to the employee's seniority when for example she or he is on temporary lay-off? How long can the employee retain the seniority he or she had accumulated prior to being laid-off ? What happens to her seniority when an employee goes on maternity leave ? Does she retain it ? Or does she not only retain it, but continue to accumulate it while she is on leave ? Or can she accumulate seniority only during a certain period of her leave ? More generally, could there be some types of leave during which continued accumulation of seniority would be provided for, while seniority accumulated prior to the taking of the leave would simply be retained during other types of leave? Does an employee who has had to leave the company through no fault of his (her) own, or has simply decided to leave the company, automatically lose his (her) seniority ? 4 These are a few of the many questions that can be raised. 2. For the purpose of analyzing seniority provisions, we have considered two major types of seniority concepts : the first one, straight seniority, means that length of service is the only factor to be considered ; for example, employees would be promoted on the basis of their length of service alone ; in our own experience, this type of seniority is very seldom found in collective agreements in relation to promotions and lay-offs. Which type of seniority concept is, then, more frequently found ?Contingent or modified seniority is far more prevalent in the agreements we have analyzed ; and it simply means that other factors than length of service (such as ability to do the job, performance, punctuality, etc.) are to be considered along with length of service. Perhaps two brief examples here may be more helpful than a lengthy explanation. Here are, then, two examples of collective agreement provisions based in our view on the concept of contingent or modified seniority :Example 1  : « In cases of promotions, [...] ., the skills, ability and efficiency of the employees shall be the governing factor and where these things are equal, seniority shall be the governing factor [...] .  »Example 2  : « In the event of reduction of staff and rehiring of employees seniority shall apply provided the employée with the greater amount of seniority can satisfactorily perform the job he is assigned to, or can learn the job within reasonable time [...] .  »These two provisions, illustrating the concept of contingent or modified seniority, are also an illustration of two subconcepts. Example 1 was indeed based on what could be called the concept ofequal ability, meaning that seniority will govern if there is equality in ability (and other factors, if any) to perform the job ; example 2 was based, on the other hand, on the concept ofsufficient ability, meaning that seniority will govern if the employee has sufficient ability to perform the job. Fields of seniority recognition 3. The two provisions just cited also provided examples of areas where seniority would be taken into account — or what might be called « fields of seniority recognition ». Example 1 had to do with the problem of staff reduction and rehiring, while example 2 dealt with promotions. There can of course be other fields of seniority recognition : transfers, choice of vacation time, choice of working time, to mention a few. There is also the range of length-of-service related benefits such as graduated vacation plans, sick leave, etc., that one finds in collective agreements. Seniority Units 4. A brief word should now perhaps be said about seniority units; in other words (and to proceed descriptively) one can have occupation-wide, department-wide, plant-wide, company-wide (in multi-plant company), etc., seniority units. Without wanting to go into too many details, our understanding of the seniority unit it the unit within which the years of service of the employee are considered : for example, an employee may have been fifteen years, in the plant, but only 7 years in department X of the plant. It could be stated, therefore, that such an employee has fifteen years' plant seniority, and 7 years' seniority in department X. These may be very important distinction since the seniority of the employee (together with other factors, depending on that the provision says) might be considered on a plant-wide basis in cases of lay-offs for example ; and his seniority might be considered on a department-wide basis in cases of promotions. One example will be provided here of the latter type of provisions, and one example of the former 5. Enough has perhaps been stated at this point to suggest that seniority provisions can indeed be very important to employees : in terms not only of promotional opportunities, but also in terms of job protection, work satisfaction, etc. Seniority provisions in a context of changing technologyYet when we read a seniority provision, we always tend to place it — perhaps as should be done — in the world of work of 1970, which is one of fast changing technology. In relation to this very point, and before concluding, a few questions will be raised. When a seniority clause provides that « in cases of promotions, [...] . the skills, ability and efficiency of the employees shall be the governing factor and where these things are equal, seniority shall be the governing factor [...] .  » some questions are raised in our minds and these questions are simply submitted here for consideration. In a context of a changing technology resulting in new skill requirements, what would be the real meaning of « equal ability » as between senior and younger employees, in organizations where senior employees — set in their habits and perhaps in skills in need of updating — would be competing for promotion with younger employees freshly graduated from recognized institutes of technology and science, and mastering the knowledge required for an effective performance in those jobs open for promotion ? Furthermore, in these situations, what would be attitude of an employee's organization towards changes in technology, an organization whose membership might be considered « senior » in terms of length of service ? Or, what would be the attitude of an employees' organization with a younger membership towards displaced older employees ? And what would be the attitude of management naturally — as it should — preoccupied with efficiency ?CONCLUSIONThese were some questions that we had wished to raise by way of conclusion. It is hoped that it has been demonstrated in this article that to discuss collective agreements and seniority provisions is not to be involved in theoretical dissertations. Collective agreements and their seniority provisions, as well as their other provisions, are not only close to and part of, the work lives of hundreds of thousands of Canadians. They can also have an impact on the total of their lives. * The remarks contained in this article, are derived from a statement made by the author to theInstitute on Collective Bargaining of theRegistered Nurses' Association of Ontario (Toronto, November, 1968), are personal in nature and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Canada Department of Labour of which, at the time of the presentation of this statement, the author was an officer, nor do they necessarily reflect the Pay Research Bureau of which since July 1, 1969, the author is Assistant-Director (Research). 1 Importance of Collective Agreements in Canada — an address to the Richelieu Club of Hull (Que.), by Félix QUINET, January 16, 1968, pp. 3 - 4. 2 This figure is quoted fromImportance of Collective Agreements in Canada — an address to the Richelieu Club of Hull (Que.), by Félix QUINET, January 16, 1968, pp. 3 - 4. 3 It might perhaps be in order to suggest here that collective agreements may also make contributions in equally important contexts as that of the response to technological change. To illustrate this point, a couple of questions might be raised : When employees with a grievance realize that the complaints which they make are studied closely by an impartial arbitrator, because of the collective agreement, will these employees not have a very concrete and practical concept of the working of justice ? Is it unrealistic to believe that it is possible for a grievance procedure within a collective agreement applying to teachers, to facilitate in certain cases, the examination of questions which are intimately bound up with the salutary but delicate exercice of academic freedom ? Furthermore, is it far-fetched to think that, in certain cases, the workings of collective agreements concerning teachers could offer a concrete idea of the nature of academic freedom ? In our opinion, these are some of the unquestionably positive aspects of collective agreements that do not seem to receive their fair share of attention from the public to-day. 4 In this respect, it has often been argued that the ability of employees to transfer seniority-related rights and benefits from one bargaining unit to another would be encouraging a higher degree of labour mobility. It should indeed be borne in mind that an employee might think twice before moving to a better paid job and/or to a job more in line with his ability, if by moving, this employee would lose all seniority-related rights and benefits accumulated over the years.

This article {{is not intended}} to give a descriptive and detailed account of the institutions and legal structures which, in each phase of labour relations, organize relations between the partners in every country under review. Such an analysis would be too long and too exhaustive in view of the scope of this study and, in any event, would only repeat what has already been done in many excellent publications readily accessible to and well known by those who may be interested in such matters. Instead, an attempt will be made to determine from the European industrial relations systems the most significant characteristics, the most interesting formula for Canadians, the institutions in law and fact which can best be compared to our own institutions in conformity with the purpose of our study. We will attempt to do this in respect of each of the main phases of labour-management relations as they operate in the countries under review. A — LABOUR COLLECTIVE NEGOTIATIONS AND AGREEMENTSIt should be noted at the outset that, in matters of negotiations and labour relations more generally, one distinction should first be made. Whereas some countries like Great Britain, Sweden and Denmark maintained almost intact their pre-war legislative and institutional frameworks, the collective negotiation systems of the countries of the European Economic Community, i. e., France, Belgium, Holland, West Germany and Italy, all underwent transformations, at times drastic since 1945, through new or renewed constitutional provisions or amended or entirely different legislation. Most of the changes were based on an increasing acceptance of the existence of trade unions and on a better defined and more liberal status for collective agreements. During the period of intensive reconstruction, from 1945 to about 1950, the liberty of the parties in determining salaries was obviously kept at a minimum by restrictive regulation. 1 But, with the exception of this brief severely « controlled » period, the trend was generally in the direction mentioned above. Even in the Netherlands where controls are still relatively severe, because of the prevailing situation, some relaxation has become apparent in recent years. One indication is the substitution of the Labour Foundation to the State Mediators College for the approval of collective agreements. Also, and this may appear to be paradoxical at first sight but quite logical after proper examination, it was precisely during this period, from 1945 to 1950, that new formulas now accepted were tried out and underwent their first practical tests. The Status of Collective AgreementsIt must be pointed out that, for our purposes, collective agreements generally in European countries, in Great Britain and Scandinavia {{as well as in the}} Common Market countries, consisted primarily of extensive regulations covering individual labour contracts. It is not comparable to our local agreements which cover and control every detail of industrial life at the plant level and in day to day working relations. It is relatively free of substantial regulations governing working conditions in the various industrial units to which it applies. It is necessary to make these comments in view of the situation on this side of the Atlantic. It must be pointed out, however, that for the last fifteen years or so in Common Market countries and even longer in the Scandinavian countries, considerable progress was made in improving agreements either at the level where they are negotiated or through the development of enterprise agreements themselves, which are now much more prevalent than they were before the war. Agreements consist primarily of « minimum compulsory standards of individual contracts between each employer and his employees ». 2 This situation derives from the conditions in connection with industrial relations systems in Europe, but it also demonstrates the still powerful influence of common law in Europe generally on labour relations, in contrast with what one might surmise at first sight. If it is true that « sociologically » several countries such as Great Britain and Scandinavian countries as well as Belgium have,in practice, gone far beyond pure legal formalism, the fact remains that legally individual contracts regulate in the final analysis day to day working relations between individual employees and management. This is apparent, for example, in the settlement of disputes concerning general working conditions. In any event, collective agreements have no legal status of their own in several countries, notably in England, Belgium 3 and Italy. Evidently, however, they are often in practice more effective there than in countries where they have a real legal status. The fact remains however that, since they are designed as minimum standards often without substance and leaving a great deal to the sole discretion of management in determining most actual working conditions, they do not contribute significantly to sound co-operation in industrial relations at the local level. 4 The Parties to AgreementsFrance and the Netherlands require that a union be a legal entity to sign collective agreements as defined in labour legislation. Other countries, such as Sweden and Germany, recognize the obligation for parties to an agreement to « keep the peace » while the agreement is in force and penalties are provided for in this matter. This point is interesting for industrial peace. In England, where trade unions are not legal entities, and are protected by statute from legal actions in their endeavours in pursuing their economic interests in labour relations, certain parties recently expressed the opinion that, in order to check non-official strikes which have been so numerous in recent years, trade unions should be given legal entities, respect agreements as contracts and therefore be legally responsible for the actions of their members, particularly the shop stewards, as is the case in Sweden and West Germany, for example, in the event of strikes or any other action taken in contravention of duly negotiated agreements. 5 But what is more important for the purposes of a study such as this one, in connection with parties to an agreement, is that, in Western Europe and in every country under review, collective agreements still come under the jurisdiction in the vast majority of cases not of labour units at the local level or individual employers, but of vast employer and labour groups, generally at the level of a complete industrial branch and, in some contries such as Sweden and Denmark, at the level of the economy as a whole. 6 On the whole, the statutes reviewed are very clearly directed in this manner. So much so in fact, that one could assume that legislators intended in those countries to center labour relations negotiations on the greater units (federations and confederations grouping wage-earners or management) so that the resulting agreements would be more readily integrated in general economic and social policies in these countries, and that agreements entered into would have a « community » feature and negotiating parties would consequently be more conscious of the implications of their decisions on working conditions for the economy as a whole in such countries. All legislative texts to define collective agreements as capable of being entered into by individual employers and trade unions without giving further details, but a wide range of provisions actually favour clearly negotiations beyond the local level, notably the industry branch level. The Extension of Agreements. There is the possibility provided for almost universally of the local extension of labour collective agreements in Europe, under certain conditions. It is in a sense the logical consequence of the negotiations system in these countries, which consider much more readily that the determination of working conditions results from vast regulations, undoubtedly negotiated for the greater part, but always designed to be used as standards for large sectors of the economy and therefore capable of being more readily integrated in the framework of general salary and working conditions policies, and one can only agree that this is somewhat opposed to the spirit of our North American industrial relations systems. With the extension procedure, public powers in almost all of the countries under review were able to obtain full participation of labour and management associations in the determination of working conditions, even in those sectors where they are not fully represented, and laying down at the same time certain conditions so that standards set by private parties are truly representative of the areas to which they apply and do not disrupt industrial sectors. The precautions taken in such countries before granting extension should be remembered if ever we attempted to follow this course more extensively. Briefly, what are these precautions ? In France, under the provisions of the statutes of February, 1950, only those associations representing management and labour can enter into an agreement capable of extension. Management representation must be an « association » under the terms of the act, i. e., have legal status. The same applies obviously to labour. De facto groups can enter into « ordinary » agreements but not an agreement capable of extension. This is all the more so for an individual employer who could never negotiate towards extension as can be done under the terms of the Collective Agreements Act of Québec. Furthermore, groups on both sides must be « representative » of the trade group or sector covered, be it local, regional or national. Nothing in the texts defines « representative », but the courts and administrative practice have provided for this. The detailed enumeration of the criteria would fall outside the scope of this study Furthermore, they must include a certain number of clauses whose provisions themselves obviously remain free. Generally, extension covers the whole of a pre-determined industry branch and even, in some cases, to the whole of the branches at the national level, for example, the national intertrade agreement on supplementary pensions. In Germany, at least 50 % of the workers involved must already be covered by an agreement before it can be extended, and there are certain other conditions. In Italy, nothing in the texts positively provides for legal extension but in practice, under the constitution and the powers given in the 1959 statutes, the government has practised extension in certain cases, at least in matters relating to salaries. In Belgium, an agreement can only be imposed on non-contracting parties if it has been entered into within a joint parity commission where the parties involved must also be « representative ». In Holland, extension is not considered an exceptional procedure, because it applies automatically when an agreement is approved by the Labour Foundation, a consultative parity organization at the national level with which we will deal further on. As for Great Britain, we are familiar with their wages councils system, which can extend salary standards in trade union sectors to the whole of a branch or region. In Sweden and Denmark, this extension procedure is non-existent as such in law, but trade unionism is so powerful and the authority of negotiation parties is so effective that, in practice, the few employees not covered by agreements obtain the same advantages as the others. Furthermore, in Sweden, the provisions of the 1928 Labour Collective Agreements Act permit terms of an agreement to be in a manner of speaking « imposed » through pressures during negotiations disputes between an employer who is not covered and his employees, by those who are already covered (strike or sympathy action). It must be noted that extension procedure is not a new development achieved during recent years. The fact remains that it is always practised and that it is still in most European labour laws, and this is why we take note of it here without evaluating its chances of disappearance or survival during the next few years. Negociation Through Joint OrganizationsOne of the most common formulas used in Western Europe for collective negotiations, and for that matter for several other labour relations aspects (for example dispute settlements) is what is called « paritism ». Paritism consists of any formula or any institution within which the social partners meet, discuss, negotiate and determine « jointly », generally without the help of a third party and without resorting to open dispute, the relations systems between them in connection with labour relations, and every other aspect of their relations on problems of any type. Paritism implies necessarily a certain equilibrium of forces, a mutual recognition of the diverging points of view of the partners, a determination to achieve compromise where possible, a certain consensus on the long-term objectives to be reached by each party, and, finally, a certain maturity which will incite the partners to make all possible decisions on their own, while limiting as far as possible resorting to arbitration and compulsory decisions by the public powers. In our opinion this constitutes the most spectacular post-war development in certain continental European countries in relation to institutionalized co-operation in labour relations. What differentiates the situation in negotiations co-operation as between Great Britain and the Scandinavian countries on the one hand and the countries of the European Economic Community on the other hand, is that in the former countries government abstention is almost total (joint decision procedures were developed in those countries as safeguards against state intervention) while in those countries of the latter group where they are most prevalent, measures were initiated following increased intervention of the public powers in the field of labour-management relations, after the Second World War. In such countries, paritism is not the same as in the former countries and is not the result of agreements between parties (free « contractual » system), but rather of co-operation with the public powers who included these matters in a « policy », by instituting them and by maintaining them with the support of the interested parties (accepted « statutory » system). B — DISPUTE SETTLEMENTS AND INDUSTRIAL PEACEThe dispute settlement system in labour relations vary considerably from one country to another. It is therefore extremely difficult to sift out common features which could, by themselves, give a good idea of the overall situation in this connection. As for individual labour dispute settlements certain West European countries, at least from a legal point of view, have no other procedure than common law. In Holland, for example, there are labour magistrates, but they are operating within ordinary jurisdictions. In France, Germany, Sweden and Denmark, as well as in Belgium labour tribunals deal with these disputes. In Germany and Sweden for example, the decisions of these tribunals are final and without appeal. On the other hand, in France, beyond a certain amount, appeal can be made to appeal courts and to the social chamber of the Appeal Court. In England, nothing in the Act imposes recourse to labour tribunals which do not exist. An individual dispute is legally based on the individual labour contract (as is the case for the other countries mentioned above) and there can be, in theory, recourse to ordinary tribunals. In practice, a whole series of conciliation stages is provided between the parties from the local level up to the national level and, eventually, the dispute can be brought before the Industrial Court, whose decision in fact is not mandatory, unless the parties agree to it beforehand. As to the distinction between legal disputes and disputes in interests, i. e., the interpretation or the violation of an existing agreement, during negotiations or the renewal of an agreement, certain countries make a clear distinction between these two types of disputes while other countries make no distinction at all. In the former group, mention could be made of West Germany, Sweden and Denmark where any dispute arising on the interpretation of a collective agreement must be brought before a labour tribunal, whether it is collective or individual ; this springs from a principle recognized in these countries that the signatories must respect industrial peace when they are bound by an agreement. The second group includes Belgium, Italy, England and France, where nothing in the statutes, as far as we know, prevents the eventuality of a strike during the term of an agreement in connection with a collective dispute, unless the parties had excluded this action in the agreement. None of the countries have compulsory arbitration procedures for disputes of interests, at least as far as private services are concerned. Employer associations as well as employee associations were always firmly opposed to this, since, according to them, this would be tantamount to state salary controls, as is more or less the case in New Zealand and Australia. Management and labour representatives on the Belgian National Labour Council, during the study recently made by it of a proposed bill to organize collective social relations between workers and employers, were once again opposed to having a clause deal with this because « in connection with arbitration, the execution force results from arbitration compromise », achieved between the parties themselves if they deemed it advisable to submit to it. ConciliationIn most European countries, conciliation procedures are a purely voluntary matter subordinated to the will of the parties. Obviously most of the countries have placed at the disposal of the parties, for a long time in many cases, conciliation and mediation services and the social partners themselves have often developed such procedures either through basic agreements to this end or through collective agreement themselves. The fact remains, however, that it is interesting to note how, in Canada, our labour laws are by far more stringent than those of these countries in Western Europe. In England, Germany, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark, there is no legal obligation to resort to conciliation procedures. Only France, in spite of the fact that it liberalized significantly its legislation in this field since 1936, still maintains compulsory conciliation (without procedures) in case of industrial disputes. Section 5 of the statute of February 1950 states that all collective labour disputes must be submitted to conciliation. But this conciliation does not rule out strikes and can take place during strikes. Furthermore, no penalty is provided for in case this obligation was not fulfilled, except that a fine can be levied for failing to appear before the Conciliation Commission. If, as we have just seen, legislation is most summary and not compulsory in relation to conciliation or mediation procedures in European countries, this does not mean, and far from it, that conciliation and mediation are non-existent in their labour relations systems. Quite to the contrary, in most countries, conciliation is common practice on a voluntary basis. The social partners preferred to rely on their own initiative in this field rather than see the government intervene. Joint OrganizationsIt must also be said that where joint organizations exist at the level of the branch activity, as is the case for example in England, Belgium and the Netherlands, these organizations are expected not only to negotiate agreements but also to settle disputes arising between the parties and they constitute, because of this, the best channel through which these disputes are taken up and settled. Paritism plays an important role in this sector. Since collective agreements are generally centralized at their level, these joint organizations constitute the logical terminal for the settlement of disputes. In our opinion, this is an important example of institutionalized co-operation allowing the parties themselves, often without the help of third parties, to settle their own problems without resorting in most cases to tests of economic strength or violence. This is also due to the fact that, in Europe, management and labour confederations effectively control their affiliated bodies and members. England's experience in this field is quite revealing. This may be where the control of the central authority over the basic elements at the local level is at its weakest and least efficient both for employers and workers. The presence of the shop steward, who represents the union but holds his authority from the members he represents, often excludes any « real » presence of the confederation in the establishment. In Great Britain, the number of days lost through strikes or lockouts has increased in recent years in comparison to the other countries of Western Europe, in spite of joint industrial councils and long tested procedures for private conciliation at the industry branch level. All this tends to show that everywhere where control from top to bottom is even slightly effective, co-operation is made much easier when it is achieved at a higher level, where the dispute is out of the hands of the interested parties...|$|E

The opposition Labour Party, led by Harold Wilson, had contested the October 1974 general election with a commitment to renegotiate Britain's terms of membership of the EC and then hold a referendum on whether {{to remain in the}} EC on the new terms. All of the major political parties and the mainstream press supported continuing membership of the EC. However, there were significant divides within the ruling Labour Party; a 1975 one-day party conference voted by two to one in favour of withdrawal, and seven of the 23 cabinet ministers were opposed to EC membership, with Harold Wilson suspending the constitutional <b>convention</b> of Cabinet <b>collective</b> responsibility to allow those ministers to publicly campaign against the government.|$|R

50|$|The {{referendum}} {{was called}} in April 1975 after the renegotiation was formally concluded. Since Prime Minister Harold Wilson's cabinet was split between supporters and opponents of the Common Market, and since members of each side held their views strongly, he made the decision, unprecedented outside coalition government, to suspend the constitutional <b>convention</b> of Cabinet <b>collective</b> responsibility. Cabinet members {{would be allowed to}} publicly campaign against each other. In total, seven of the twenty-three members of the cabinet opposed EC membership. Wilson's solution was that ministers speaking from the despatch box would reflect government policy, i.e. support for EC membership, but that they would be allowed to speak freely otherwise. This compromise avoided mass dismissals of Cabinet ministers, with only Eric Heffer among all government ministers being obliged to resign, because of his speaking against EC membership in the House of Commons.|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} changes {{that occurred in}} the last 30 years have substantially modified the capitalistic organization of society, both at national and international level. A new regime of accumulation devoid of a stable mode of regulation and centred on financial valorisation of new socio-economic growth perspectives has been consolidating. Conditions imposed by financial markets in order to create the shareholder's value consisted of promoting downsizing, reengineering, outsourcing and M&A processes. The flexibilization of labour force and precarization of existence has thus been the result of the established valorization norm. But why should the corporate restructuring sustain the enterprise value by creating income stock ? The definition of a new regime of accumulation involves a research on the criteria of valorisation and the prevailing technological paradigm. The main changes of new capitalism concern mainly two spheres: the role played by knowledge in the new technological paradigm and valorisation process and the importance of finance. The dominant technological paradigm and the role played by knowledge within it are not enough to explain the evolution of the accumulation regime. It is needed to introduce further elements necessary to explain the expectations that sustain the investment choices made by capitalists; these are the <b>conventions</b> or <b>collective</b> beliefs. Then, after describing the main features of the accumulation paradigm that many scholars have not hesitated to name as Cognitive Capitalism, we shall attempt to provide a theoretical framework of it intended as a financial economy of production. We shall therefore proceed to the reformulation of the schemes of monetary circuit (Graziani 2003) ...|$|R
