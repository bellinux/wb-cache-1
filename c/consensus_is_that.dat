5|$|Jesus was a Galilean Jew, born {{around the}} {{beginning}} of the 1st century, who died in 30 or 33 AD in Judea. The general scholarly <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Jesus was a contemporary of John the Baptist and was crucified by the Roman governor Pontius Pilate, who held office from 26 to 36 AD.|$|E

5|$|The {{historical}} <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> responsibility or {{guilt for}} the war was not attached to the article. Rather, the clause was a prerequisite to allow a legal basis to be laid out for the reparation payments that were to be made. Historians have also highlighted the unintended damage created by the clause, which caused anger and resentment amongst the German population.|$|E
5|$|While {{the popular}} <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{olfaction}} {{is very important}} for hunting, two studies that experimentally investigated the role of olfactory, auditory, and visual cues found that visual cues are the most important ones for hunting in red foxes and coyotes.|$|E
5|$|As {{they share}} many {{cross-platform}} games and {{compete for the}} same audience as their predecessors, frequent comparisons are made between the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The PS3 uses the Blu-ray format, while the Xbox 360 uses a standard DVD9. The Xbox 360 is less expensive to produce, and analysts expect that a mid-revision will allow Microsoft to break-even on manufacturing costs, while industry <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Xbox 360's conventional architecture is easier to develop for.|$|E

5|$|Based on the {{findings}} of these and other studies in the early 1970s, the current <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the use of methoxyflurane should be restricted only to healthy individuals, in situations where it offers specific advantages and even then, only at dosages less than 2.5MAC hours. Partly because of these warnings, but also because of the development of newer volatile anesthetics such as enflurane, isoflurane, desflurane and sevoflurane, the clinical use of methoxyflurane as a general anesthetic in humans was largely abandoned in the mid-1970s.|$|E
5|$|Between 1983 and 1989 the {{paintings}} underwent technical examination and were extensively restored and cleaned. Technical {{analysis of the}} Philadelphia painting established that the wood panel comes from the same tree as that of two paintings definitively attributed to van Eyck, and that the Italian panel has underdrawings of a quality that it is thought could only have come from him. After nearly 500 years, {{the paintings}} were reunited in 1998 in an exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Today the <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> both were painted by the same hand.|$|E
5|$|Highly {{energetic}} {{chemistry is}} thought to have produced a self-replicating molecule around 4 billion years ago, and half a billion years later the last common ancestor of all life existed. The current scientific <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the complex biochemistry that makes up life came from simpler chemical reactions. The beginning of life may have included self-replicating molecules such as RNA and the assembly of simple cells.|$|E

5|$|Less clearcut is the {{question}} of whether the regular auxilia recruited barbari (barbarians, as the Romans called people living outside the empire's borders). Although there is little evidence of it before the 3rd century, the <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> auxilia recruited barbarians throughout their history. In the 3rd century, a few auxilia units of clearly barbarian origin start to appear in the record e.g. Ala I Sarmatarum, cuneus Frisiorum and numerus Hnaufridi in Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanisms}} of CCD are still unknown, but many causes {{are currently being}} considered, such as pesticides, mites, fungi, beekeeping practices (such {{as the use of}} antibiotics or long-distance transportation of beehives), malnutrition, poor quality queens, starvation, other pathogens, and immunodeficiencies. The current scientific <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> no single factor is causing CCD, but that some of these factors in combination may lead to CCD either additively or synergistically.|$|E
5|$|The red-winged fairywren {{was officially}} {{described}} by ornithologist John Gould in 1837, who derived the bird's specific name {{derived from the}} Latin term elegans 'elegant'. He gave its location as the East Coast, but realised his error after further collections by John Gilbert from Southwestern Australia. Amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews described birds from the southern karri forests as subspecies warreni in 1916 {{on the basis of}} darker female plumage. However, others have not observed this subsequently and the <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> no separate subspecies are recognized. In fact there is little variation in size or colour within the species between populations or individuals.|$|E

5|$|The {{scientific}} <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the asteroid}} impact at the K–Pg boundary left megatsunami deposits and sediments {{around the area}} of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, from the colossal waves created by the impact. These deposits have been identified in the La Popa basin in northeastern Mexico, platform carbonates in northeastern Brazil, in Atlantic deep-sea sediments, and {{in the form of the}} thickest-known layer of graded sand deposits, around 100m thick, in the Chicxulub crater itself, directly above the shocked granite ejecta.|$|E
5|$|While {{none of the}} {{historical}} sources explicitly state Ecgfrith's reason for attacking Fortriu in 685, the <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it was to reassert Northumbria's eroded hegemony over the Picts. The most thorough description of the battle is given by Bede in his 8th century work Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum (The Ecclesiastical History of the English People) (completed c731), but this is still brief. Additional detail is given in the Irish annals of Ulster and Tigernach, and by the early Welsh historian Nennius in his Historia Brittonum (written c. 830).|$|E
5|$|Amenhotep I was {{succeeded by}} Thutmose I, {{apparently}} a senior military figure. It is unclear {{if there was}} any blood relationship between the two, although {{it has been suggested that}} Thutmose I was a son of Amenhotep's elder brother Ahmose Sipairi. Amenhotep may have appointed Thutmose I as coregent before his own death as Thutmose I's name appears next to Amenhotep's on a divine barque found by archeologists in the fill of the third pylon at Karnak. However, most scholars consider that this is only evidence of Thutmose associating himself with his royal predecessor. One text has also been interpreted to mean that Amenhotep appointed his infant son as coregent, who then predeceased him. However, the scholarly <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there is too little evidence for either coregency.|$|E
50|$|Although the POWs {{were not}} coerced into making an {{immediate}} decision {{with regard to}} joining the INA, the general <b>consensus</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> many of the POWs with the exceptions of the higher ranking British officials and the Gurkha contingent were sufficiently convinced.|$|R
50|$|A daytime {{assault was}} {{initially}} planned, but was postponed at the British battalion commander's request.

5|$|On 28 June, Model {{was sent}} to rescue Army Group Centre, which had been torn apart by Operation Bagration, the Soviet {{offensive}} in Belorussia. The Ninth Army (Model's old command) and Fourth Army were trapped, and the Red Army was about to liberate Minsk. Despite the catastrophic situation, Model believed that he could still hold Minsk, but this would require Fourth Army {{to break out of}} its pocket, and reinforcements to counter-attack the Soviet advance. The reinforcements, in turn, could only be obtained by pulling back, thus shortening the line and freeing up troops. The <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the German position was doomed, regardless of what Model could have done, but Hitler refused to sanction either Fourth Army's escape or a general withdrawal, until it was too late.|$|E
5|$|The authorship of seventy-three of The Federalist essays {{is fairly}} certain. Twelve of these essays are disputed over by some scholars, though the modern <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Madison wrote essays Nos. 49–58, with Nos. 18–20 being {{products}} of {{a collaboration between}} him and Hamilton; No. 64 was by John Jay. The first open designation of which essay belonged to whom was provided by Hamilton, who {{in the days before}} his ultimately fatal gun duel with Aaron Burr provided his lawyer with a list detailing the author of each number. This list credited Hamilton with a full sixty-three of the essays (three of those being jointly written with Madison), almost three-quarters of the whole, and was used as the basis for an 1810 printing that was the first to make specific attribution for the essays.|$|E
5|$|The more {{commonly}} spoken languages dominate the less commonly spoken languages, so the less commonly spoken languages eventually disappear from populations. The {{total number of}} languages {{in the world is}} not known. Estimates vary depending on many factors. The <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there are between 6,000 and 7,000 languages spoken as of 2010, and that between 50–90% of those will have become extinct by the year 2100. The top 20 languages, those spoken by more than 50 million speakers each, are spoken by 50% of the world's population, whereas many of the other languages are spoken by small communities, most of them with less than 10,000 speakers.|$|E
