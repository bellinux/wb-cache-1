On 13 December 1643 Captain Thomas Sandford and eight soldiers from that army crept into Beeston at night (possibly aided by treachery) and surprised the castle governor, Captain Thomas Steele, who was so shaken by the event that he surrendered on the promise {{that he would be}} allowed to march out of the castle with honours. Steele was tried and shot for his failure to hold the castle.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of a tropical storm, warnings were issued for the Cayman Islands, the northwestern and central Bahamas, and the Cuban provinces of Matanzas, Cienfuegos, Villa Clara, Sancti Spíritus, and Ciego de Ávila on September28. However, the warnings were discontinued the following day after reports of the storm's prompt dissipation. After forecasters warned of severe weather across the Cayman Islands, schools and government offices closed in low-lying areas, and emergency teams <b>cleaned</b> <b>out</b> storm drains and readied shelters. Thunderstorms in Grand Cayman forced Cayman Airways to cancel all express flights to Cayman Brac and Little Cayman on October29; weather-resistant jet service was provided to stranded passengers. A marine warning was required for all three islands due to rough sea conditions.|$|E
5|$|Like wolves, coyotes use a den (usually {{the deserted}} holes of other species) when gestating and rearing young, {{though they may}} {{occasionally}} give birth under sagebrushes in the open. Coyote dens can be located in canyons, washouts, coulees, banks, rock bluffs, or level ground. Some dens have been found under abandoned homestead shacks, grain bins, drainage pipes, railroad tracks, hollow logs, thickets, and thistles. The den is continuously dug and <b>cleaned</b> <b>out</b> by the female until the pups are born. Should the den be disturbed or infested with fleas, the pups are moved into another den. A coyote den can have several entrances and passages branching out from the main chamber. A single den can be used year after year.|$|E

40|$|Sanitary sewer {{overflows}} {{are extremely}} detrimental to a surrounding watershed. An overflow occurs when volume exceeds capacity. There are several causes of an overflow; {{one of these}} causes is poorly maintained sewer <b>clean</b> <b>out</b> stations, which lead to blockages. Blockages are caused by grease buildup or other foreign objects. These <b>clean</b> <b>out</b> stations need to be serviced regularly to avoid blockages {{and to provide a}} more free flowing system. By using GIS, with a network analyst extension, I was able to design routes for a fleet of MAWSS (Mobile Area Water and Sewer System) trucks to cover all of these sewer <b>clean</b> <b>outs</b> in the most timely efficient way. These routes were designed based on where the <b>clean</b> <b>outs</b> are and the number of trucks that will go out cleaning these stations. Historic traffic data was also gathered from the City of Mobile. By being more efficient cleaning the sewer lines, the number of sanitary sewer overflows should be reduced, thus improving the water quality of the surrounding watershed...|$|R

In matches of more than one day's duration, if necessary, the footholes made by the bowler in his delivery stride may be returfed or covered with quick-setting fillings to make them safe and secure. Players may also secure their footholes using sawdust provided that the pitch is not damaged or they do not do so {{in a way that is}} unfair to the other team.|$|E
25|$|By the 16th century, cesspits and cesspools were {{increasingly}} {{dug into the}} ground near houses in Europe {{as a means of}} collecting waste, as urban populations grew and street gutters became blocked with the larger volume of human waste. Rain was no longer sufficient to wash away waste from the gutters. A pipe connected the latrine to the cesspool, and sometimes a small amount of water washed waste through. Cesspools were <b>cleaned</b> <b>out</b> by tradesmen, who pumped out liquid waste, then shovelled out the solid waste and collected it during the night. This solid waste, euphemistically known as Nightsoil, was sold as fertilizer for agricultural production (similarly to the closing-the-loop approach of ecological sanitation).|$|E
25|$|To {{remove any}} odor and {{excessive}} {{fat in the}} dish, any white fat adhering to the intestines should be meticulously <b>cleaned</b> <b>out</b> by rubbing them with wheat flour and salt and washing them several times. Since cooking the dish requires not only specialized cooking techniques {{and a great deal}} of labor to prepare, but also very fresh ingredients, gopchang jeongol is generally eaten at restaurants specializing in tripe dishes. The dish, which is seasoned with a hot and spicy red chili-based sauce, is served as a main entrée, accompanied with a bowl of steamed rice. It is often shared between several diners on the center of the table, and is also a popular anju when drinking alcoholic beverages such as soju in South Korea.|$|E

25|$|Older {{furnaces}} {{may contain}} rubber parts {{that would be}} affected by biodiesel's solvent properties, but can otherwise burn biodiesel without any conversion required. Care must be taken, however, given that varnishes left behind by petrodiesel will be released and can clog pipes- fuel filtering and prompt filter replacement is required. Another approach is to start using biodiesel as a blend, and decreasing the petroleum proportion over time can allow the varnishes to come off more gradually and be less likely to clog. Thanks to its strong solvent properties, however, the furnace is <b>cleaned</b> <b>out</b> and generally becomes more efficient. A technical research paper describes laboratory research and field trials project using pure biodiesel and biodiesel blends as a heating fuel in oil-fired boilers.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} method to hatcheries {{is to use}} spawning channels. These are artificial streams, usually parallel to an existing stream, with concrete or rip-rap sides and gravel bottoms. Water from the adjacent stream is piped {{into the top of}} the channel, sometimes via a header pond, to settle out sediment. Spawning success is often much better in channels than in adjacent streams due to the control of floods, which in some years can wash out the natural redds. Because of the lack of floods, spawning channels must sometimes be <b>cleaned</b> <b>out</b> to remove accumulated sediment. The same floods that destroy natural redds also clean the regular streams. Spawning channels preserve the natural selection of natural streams, as there is no benefit, as in hatcheries, to use prophylactic chemicals to control diseases.|$|E
25|$|Because Egyptian society {{under the}} Greeks and Romans was governed bureaucratically, and because Oxyrhynchus was {{the capital of}} the 19th nome, the {{material}} at the Oxyrhynchus dumps included vast amounts of papyri. Accounts, tax returns, census material, invoices, receipts, correspondence on administrative, military, religious, economic, and political matters, certificates and licenses of all kindsall these were periodically <b>cleaned</b> <b>out</b> of government offices, put in wicker baskets, and dumped out in the desert. Private citizens added their own piles of unwanted papyri. Because papyrus was expensive, papyri were often reused: a document might have farm accounts on one side, and a student's text of Homer on the other. The Oxyrhynchus Papyri, therefore, contained a complete record {{of the life of the}} town, and of the civilizations and empires of which the town was a part.|$|E

During {{a day and a half}} he personally <b>cleaned</b> <b>out</b> six Jap machine gun nests, sometimes standing on top of a track and firing point blank at four or five men who fired back at him from behind blockhouses. Lieutenant Hawkins was wounded a second time, but he still refused to retire. To say that his conduct was worthy of the highest traditions of the Marine Corps is like saying the Empire State Building is moderately high.|$|E
25|$|AC Cars also {{produced}} a Le Mans coupé. The {{car was a}} one-off and was nearly destroyed after a high-speed tire blow-out at the 1964 Le Mans race. The car was qualified conservatively second in GT. The race started well with the AC, chassis number A98, maintaining {{its position in the}} top two in GT and even leading the class for a time. This was not to last as an act of sabotage (newspaper in the fuel tank) began to block the fuel filter. The car lost time until this was diagnosed and <b>cleaned</b> <b>out.</b> The car proceeded on at the predetermined conservative lap time and for the next stint remained trouble free. The car was able to match the Shelby Daytona's speed despite running a higher differential ratio (2.88 instead of 3.07) and a lower state of engine tune for reliability (355hp instead of the Daytona's 385hp).|$|E
25|$|The {{portable}} toilet is used {{on construction}} sites, film locations, and large outdoor gatherings {{where there are no}} other facilities. They are typically self-contained units that are made to be easily moved. Most portable toilets are Unisex single units with privacy ensured by a simple lock on the door. The units are usually light weight and easily transported by a flatbed truck and loaded and unloaded by a small forklift. Many portable toilets are small molded plastic or fiberglass portable rooms with a lockable door and a receptacle to catch waste in a chemically treated container. If used {{for an extended period of}} time, they have to be <b>cleaned</b> <b>out</b> and new chemicals put in the waste receptacle. For servicing multiple portable toilets, tanker trucks (vacuum trucks or honeywagons) are equipped with large vacuums to evacuate the waste and replace the chemicals. Portable toilets can also be urine-diverting dry toilets.|$|E
