5000|$|A {{thriving}} {{sea urchin}} fishery operated in Dunmanus Bay, {{in the area}} bounded by Mannion's Island Ahakista and the ruined Dunmanus Castle. The waters are shallow and this encouraged urchin growth. The fishery was operated by Paudie McSwiney, John, Patrick and Joe Arthur of Kenmare Saw Mills and John and Dermot Murphy of Bantry. The boatmen were Joe and Mick Flynn of Gearameen Durrus. The Lucey family of Waterville and a French Company operating out of Crookhaven were also in the business. At different stages four or five boats operated. The urchins were picked from the seabed by divers. John Arthur {{said that they would}} often spend four hours in the water. The urchins were sold on the French market live and were shipped through Cork Airport. The fishery was effectively wiped out with the sudden onset of red tide in the early eighties and by overharvesting, preventing regeneration. <b>Kenmare</b> <b>Bay</b> suffered a similar fate and urchin [...] "fishing" [...] is now unheard of in these bays.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the cause of the positive mouse bioassay results obtained in mussel samples from several shellfish production areas (including Bantry <b>Bay,</b> <b>Kenmare</b> <b>Bay,</b> Cromane and Lough Foyle), samples were sent in December 2000 and January 2001 for analysis. Positive mouse bioassay results were obtained, using the Yasumoto (1978) assay, in the EU Reference Laboratory and using the Yasumoto (l 984) assay in the Italian Reference Laboratory. ASP toxins, Azaspiracid, Okadaic acid and DTXs were not detected. Yessotoxin, homoYessotoxins and analogues of Yessotoxins were not detected in the samples sent to the EU Reference Laboratory or the Italian Reference Laboratory. Prof. Yasumoto detected the presence of Yessotoxin and 45 -hydroxyYessotoxin at the Japan Food Research Laboratory. 45 -hydroxyYessotoxin is a shellfish metabolite of Yessotoxin, which occurs with time as the YTX is oxidised by the shellfish. The shellfish samples in which Yessotoxin and 45 -hydroxy Yessotoxin were detected were taken from Bantry Bay, Roaring Water Bay (Summer 2000) and Mulroy Bay. If the initial detection of Yessotoxin and 45 -hydroxyYessotoxin is confirmed in other samples, the Irish biotoxin management regime and the production cycles for shellfish (in particular mussels) will have to be adapted to encompass YTX...|$|R
40|$|Extract] As one {{approaches}} Gleninchaquin Park, one {{is instantly}} impressed by two factors, the view and the tranquillity of the area. The park consists of streams, mountains, glens and lakes, a waterfall, woodlands and <b>Kenmare</b> <b>Bay,</b> all {{framed by the}} Killarney McGillicuddy Reeks along the horizon. Looking across to the magnificent view, I wonder who is fortunate enough to own hundreds of acres of land in this remote corner of Kerry. With this thought in mind, I am welcomed to the park by Mr Donal Corkery, a sheep farmer who runs a nature-based tourism venture with his family. With the unhurried manner that is so characteristic of rural Kerry, I'm invited in {{for a cup of}} tea and a chat. Family businesses can be defined in various ways, including the degree of family ownership, management by family members, interdependency of family and business systems and intention to transfer to the family (Litz, 1995; Green and Pryde, 1990). These features are applicable to Gleninchaquin Park. In recent times, researchers argue that family-centred businesses may have unique perspectives of socially responsible behaviour due to ties to the community and family involvement (Niehm, SWiney and Miller, 2008). This case study sheds some insight into how a business is connected to a rural community and the complexities of managing and sustaining an ecologically responsible family business...|$|R
60|$|But look again, and {{you will}} see that along the west coast of Ireland, except in a very few places, like Galway Bay, the blue {{limestone}} does not come down to the sea; the shore is coloured purple and brown, and those colours mark the ancient rocks and high mountains of Mayo and Galway and Kerry, which stand as barriers to keep the raging surf of the Atlantic from bursting inland and beating away, as it surely would in course of time, the low flat limestone plain of the middle of Ireland. But the same coral-reefs once stretched out far to the westward into the Atlantic Ocean; and you may see the proof upon that map. For in the western bays, in Clew Bay with its hundred islands, and Galway Bay with its Isles of Arran, and beautiful Kenmare, and beautiful Bantry, you see little blue spots, which are low limestone islands, standing in the sea, overhung by mountains far aloft. You have often heard those islands in <b>Kenmare</b> <b>Bay</b> talked of, and how some whom you know go to fish round them by night for turbot and conger; and when you hear them spoken of again, you must recollect that they are the last fragments of a great fringing coral-reef, which will in a few thousand years follow the fate of the rest, and be eaten up by the waves, while the mountains of hard rock stand round them still unchanged.|$|R

Sampling in skid trail was done with one hundred percent inventory method with a width of 12 meter. Results of this study indicated that 3. 2 percent of regeneration was damaged in felling and bucking operations and 4. 8 percent of regeneration was also damaged after winching and skidding operations. Most of these damages occurred for thicket stage. The felling and bucking operations damaged 13. 6 percent of the residual stand. The amount of damage to the stand after skidding including the whole logging damages equals 15. 5 percent. Unnecessary damages to stand and regeneration could have been avoided by selecting the best harvesting method, skidding practices, adequate incentives/disincentives and appropriate supervision...|$|R

Phages were eliminated within 45 min in the gastric compartment (pH decline from 5. 1 to 2. 5). Less than a 2 -log reduction of phage was observed in the intestinal compartment after 9 h (pH 7. 0).

40|$|Novel reduced sugar gemini amphiphiles linked {{through their}} {{tertiary}} amino head groups via alkyl spacers of 4 or 6 carbons, and with varying (unsaturated) alkyl tail lengths of 12 - 18, have been synthesized and tested for transfection in vitro in an adherent Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO-K 1). Transfection efficiencies peaked at 2. 7 {{times that of}} the commercial standard Lipofectamine Plus/ 2000 for pure solutions of the compound bearing unsaturated (oleyl) alkyl tails. For those compounds bearing saturated alkyl tails, transfection efficiency peaked at a tail length of 16, at a level similar to Lipofectamine Plus/ 2000. All of the amphiphiles formed bilayer vesicles at physiological pH. Some of the amino groups at the surface were protonated, and vesicles therefore bore a positive charge. Increased protonation with reduced pH resulted in greatly increased monomer solubility and a morphology change from vesicle to micelle at characteristic pH values, dependent on the tail length. For the compounds promoting high transfection efficiency, this characteristic pH was within the range found in the endosomal <b>compartment</b> (<b>7.</b> 4 - 4. 0). Formation of mixed micelles between gemini surfactant and membrane phospholipids at reduced pH may therefore provide a method of endosome rupture and subsequent escape of entrapped DNA, thus discarding the need for extra fusogenic or endosomolytic agents. The positive charge on the vesicles at physiological pH drives the colloidal association with DNA. Small angle X-ray scattering measurements indicate that lamellar aggregates are formed, which have a d spacing of 48 - 54 Å. Preliminary differential scanning calorimetric measurements suggest that reduction of pH causes a disordering of the hydrocarbon region of the DNA-surfactant complex. ...|$|R
