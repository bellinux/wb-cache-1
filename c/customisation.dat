Depending {{on the size of}} the source code, compiling can take a long time, but it gives the user more control over the process and its result. Most ports also have package counterparts (i.e. pre-compiled binaries), giving the user a choice. Although this method is faster, the user has fewer <b>customisation</b> options.|$|E
5|$|The game's visuals and {{spectacle}} were lauded {{by critics}} who suspected {{that it would}} amaze players. Reed questioned {{whether it was the}} best looking game to have ever been made. Critics observed that the use high frame rate and motion blur helped convey an incredible sense of speed. Other aspects such particle effects, reflections, and real-time deformation drew praise as well. Critics expressed approval over the sound design of the cars and collisions. However opinions of the licensed soundtrack and DJ were less favourable. Some writers found the DJ's enthusiastic dialogue to be annoying and had mixed opinions on the songs included in the soundtrack, but were thankful for the available audio <b>customisation</b> options.|$|E
5|$|Vanajan Autotehdas {{was always}} a small company, {{employing}} about 400 people in 1968, and in the 1960s its market share was barely 5% in Finland. Almost all Vanajas were sold for the domestic market; only a few units were exported. Vanaja vehicles became known for their robust construction and high degree of <b>customisation.</b> The number of Vanaja bus chassis and lorries totalled 7,140 units; this consists of 260 lorry and 66 bus chassis models; for 116 lorry models {{only one or two}} units were produced. Vanajas had a good reputation and they are nowadays valued by vintage vehicle enthusiasts.|$|E

25|$|Two main {{instalments}} {{were published}} for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The 2008 title Grand Theft Auto IV focused on realism and detail, removing various <b>customisation</b> features, while adding an online multiplayer mode. Grand Theft Auto V, published in 2013, featured three playable protagonists. It was released to massive financial success, breaking multiple records. It was later re-released with various enhancements, in 2014 for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and in 2015 for Microsoft Windows.|$|E

25|$|Later, an {{additional}} campaign from the Indie {{side of the}} conflict, called Defiance, was developed. The campaign consisted of 18 missions and it mirrored the I-War campaign. This time the player {{assumed the role of}} Edison Hayes, a captain of the Indie fleet and the Dreadnaught-class corvette Spartacus. Defiance had three new features: in-mission savepoints, limited <b>customisation</b> of player ship's weapons and a zoom mode for longer range weapons fire. The campaign was designed for experienced Independence War players, and was generally considered more difficult than the original game.|$|E
25|$|Exclusions & choices: Motorists {{can choose}} any {{combined}} letters and numbers including solely letters (max 6 characters). Plate <b>customisation</b> {{has also been}} added into the coloured, premium range and recently motorcycles (7 March).

There are also restrictions preventing people from picking combinations that are too similar to special plates issued by the Authority (for instance, HC-nnn and HC-nnnn combinations are reserved only for accredited hire-car operators).|$|E
25|$|Liberty City Stories and Vice City Stories are prequels to San Andreass predecessors, so both games {{derive their}} maps from Grand Theft Auto III and Vice City, respectively, {{each of which}} cover a {{considerably}} smaller area than San Andreas. Liberty City Stories and Vice City Stories eliminated gameplay elements introduced in San Andreas, including the ability to swim (in Liberty City Stories, but reintroduced in a limited capacity in Vice City Stories) and climb. Both Liberty City Stories and Vice City Stories include references to characters featured in San Andreas, with Liberty City Stories set about 6 years after the events of San Andreas (in that game, for example, radio reporter Richard Burns, featured in news bulletins in San Andreas, returns as a radio call-in guest) and Vice City Stories set about 8 years before the events of San Andreas. Except for news bulletins, radio programming in Liberty City Stories and Vice City Stories does not change based upon player progress. While character <b>customisation</b> elements such as wardrobe changes are retained, for later games, Rockstar eliminated {{the need for the}} game protagonists to eat and exercise.|$|E

500|$|Other {{versions}} {{were also}} well received. Reviewing the NES version, [...] praised the scrolling and controls. GamePro reviewer {{stated that the}} racing scenario variety and the vehicles being based on Galoob's Micro Machines toys made the game original. Mean Machines reviewer liked the presentation and playability, but described the sprites as [...] "inconsistent". In {{a review of the}} SNES version, GamePro lauded the [...] "cartoony" [...] graphics and [...] "cheerful" [...] sound effects, along with the lack of car <b>customisation</b> to keep the gameplay [...] "basic". Coming Soon Magazine's reviewer criticised the PC version's [...] "simple" [...] graphics, but thought highly of its addictiveness and [...] "well-produced" [...] animation.|$|E
500|$|The game's online {{multiplayer}} mode received {{positive reactions}} from critics. Reiner of Game Informer praised the character <b>customisation</b> {{available in the}} multiplayer mode, and noted that it runs [...] "just as smoothly" [...] as the single-player game. 1UP.com's Boyer called the multiplayer modes [...] "excellent", and IGN's Goldstein named {{it one of the}} best. Official Xbox Magazines Hicks dubbed the multiplayer as [...] "hugely entertaining", while Walter of GamesRadar praised the [...] "seamless" [...] process of entering a multiplayer match. Giant Bomb's Gerstmann and Game Revolution's Costantino felt divided about the multiplayer, the latter naming it a [...] "fantastic idea", but feeling as though connectivity problems resulted in a [...] "broken" [...] experience.|$|E

500|$|A feature called [...] "Perfect Head", which {{appeared}} in previews of the game but {{was not included in}} the final product, was intended to take <b>customisation</b> of multiplayer profiles further. This feature allowed the player to place a photograph of their choice onto their in-game character's face, via a Game Boy Camera combined with the Nintendo 64 Transfer Pak. The images taken could be manipulated with a simple image editing program to adjust their brightness and position. They could then be saved to either the Nintendo 64 cartridge or a Controller Pak and then loaded onto a player's character in multiplayer, thus creating a virtual representation of the player. Although Rare officially said the feature was dropped due to [...] "technical difficulties", the actual reason was revealed to be [...] "sensitive issues" [...] surrounding the ability to attack images of real people. Rare's decision came after the 1999 Columbine High School massacre.|$|E
500|$|In October 2006, Holden {{introduced}} a bi-fuel {{version of the}} Alloytec V6, available to the Omega and Berlina. Able to run on both petrol and LPG, it features an advanced sequential vapour gas injection (SVGI) system and hardened valve seats to cope. The bi-fuel V6 produces [...] and [...] less than the conventional V6 when run on LPG, {{for a total of}} [...] Although LPG prices are lower, the engine uses a large [...] cylindrical gas tank which causes decreased boot space and slightly increased fuel consumption. Holden was {{able to take advantage of}} a loophole in government legislation, allowing an A$2,000 rebate on LPG installation because the unit is fitted post-production by Holden's <b>customisation</b> arm HSVi. Normally, people would only be entitled to a A$1,000 rebate for new cars pre-installed with LPG. Due to the possibility that these bi-fuel Commodores may have been fitted with undersized O-rings in the service valve hand tap, Holden issued a recall affecting the first 981 of these models on 10 April 2007. There were also two VE recalls previous to this. The initial 16 October 2006 recall affecting 1,521 V8 Commodore and WM Statesman/Caprice models involved a faulty fuel hose, causing a fuel smell to enter the cabin. A second 10 November 2006 recall affecting 12,830 Commodores and WM models built prior to 11 September 2006 resulted from defective rear seat belt anchors. On 7 December 2007, another recall was issued for over 86,000 VE and WM V6 models. This was due to the possibility that one of the fuel lines in the engine compartment may have a rub condition with a fuel vapour hose clip, possibly causing a fuel smell to become evident.|$|E
500|$|Brad Shoemaker of Giant Bomb {{praised the}} driving {{mechanics}} and vehicle construction, despite initially being {{frustrated with the}} game's controls. Shoemaker praised the innovation the game offered; stating that the vehicle-building and enormous variety of mission types would attract all audiences. A reviewer of GamesRadar heavily criticised the overall mechanics and vehicular gameplay, stating that it was both [...] "ridiculously complicated" [...] and unsuitable for a Banjo game. The reviewer of GamesRadar also criticised Rare's [...] "old habit" [...] of [...] "collect-a-thons", asserting that {{all the elements of}} the game were [...] "clumsily put together" [...] and the aspects of unlocking new levels were difficult to understand due to the many items that were pre-required. Andrew Reiner of Game Informer heralded the vehicle construction as [...] "fun", however he criticised Rare's [...] "habit of forcing the player" [...] to collect large quantities of items to build their vehicles and progress through the game. A reviewer of GameTrailers similarly criticised the vehicular theme of the game, citing that the sensitive physics and controls adds up to an overall frustrating experience. Erik Brudvig of IGN US praised the game's absence of platform elements, and asked fans of Banjo-Kazooie not to [...] "write the game off" [...] due to its change in genre. Brudvig also heralded the vehicle-creation as [...] "powerful" [...] and the depth of the game's mechanics. However, Matt Wales of IGN UK criticised the new direction of the game's genre, summarising the lack of platforming action as [...] "screwed up". Wales stated that the game's mechanics and vehicle construction [...] "fails badly" [...] {{due to the lack of}} [...] "any fundamentally engaging" [...] framework to support the game's creative elements. Tom Orry of VideoGamer praised the complex construction of vehicles and stated that it was the most rewarding aspect of the game. Chris Kohler of Wired heavily criticised the mechanics, challenges and new genre of the game, panning the overall experience as a [...] "disappointing, simplistic sandbox". Kohler also added that the racing missions were [...] "boring" [...] and frustrating, similarly stating the same for vehicle <b>customisation.</b> In a retrospective review, David Roberts of GamesRadar stated that Nuts & Bolts [...] "laid down groundwork" [...] for future games that revolve around construction, such as Fallout 4 and Kerbal Space Program.|$|E

40|$|EIS {{applications}} {{are complex and}} present significant costs and issues during upgrades which can lead user organisations to defer or abandon potential upgrades and cause them {{to miss out on}} the business benefits of the upgrade. Our ongoing development of temporal meta-data EIS applications [1] seeks to avoid or minimise the majority of these upgrade issues by standardising all update procedures to become an updated set or stream of meta-data changes that will be sequentially applied to implement each individual meta-data change in order, for all changes between the previous and current meta-data models. This update process removes the need from vendors to produce version specific update programs, and fully automates the end user’s meta-data EIS application update processes. Collision detection with third party <b>customisations</b> to meta-data EIS application, known as Variant Logic, will be greatly simplified as any potential conflict will be precisely identified in advance, reducing any compatibility effort for the <b>customisations</b> and ensuring timely availability for inclusion with the streamlined meta-data update.
