500|$|Drawing {{attention}} to the intrinsically manipulative nature of the medium, Nolan uses narrative and stylistic techniques (notably mise en abyme and recursions) to stimulate the viewer to ask themselves why his films are put together in such ways and why the films provoke particular responses. He sometimes uses editing {{as a way to}} represent the characters' psychological states, merging their subjectivity with that of the audience. For example, in Memento the fragmented sequential order of scenes is to put the audience into a similar experience of Leonard's defective ability to create new long-term memories. In The Prestige, the series of magic tricks and themes of duality and deception mirror the structural narrative of the film. His writing style incorporates a number of storytelling techniques such as flashbacks, shifting points of view and unreliable narrators. Scenes are often interrupted by the unconventional editing style of cutting away quickly from the money shot (or nearly cutting off characters' dialogue) and <b>crosscutting</b> several scenes of parallel action to build to a climax. In 2017, noted film theorist and historian David Bordwell wrote about Nolan's fascination with subjective storytelling and <b>crosscutting,</b> [...] "It's rare to find any mainstream director so relentlessly focused on exploring a particular batch of storytelling techniques ... Nolan zeroes in, from film to film, on a few narrative devices, finding new possibilities in what most directors handle routinely. He seems to me a very thoughtful, almost theoretical director in his fascination with turning certain conventions this way and that, to reveal their unexpected possibilities." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Crosscut</b> {{property}} of subsets {{in the unit}} sphere Sn ⊂ En+ 1 has been defined. Its relation with convexity has been studied. Illustrating examples are given. The <b>crosscut</b> of a subset in Euclidean space En has been considered in [4, 5] as follows: A <b>crosscut</b> of a set A ⊂ En is a closed segment [xy] such that the open segment (xy) = [xy] x, y is contained in Int(A) and x, y ∈ ∂A. The following result relating this concept with convexity is proved in [4, 5]. Theorem 1. If an open set K ⊂ En has no <b>crosscuts,</b> then its complement Kc is a convex set. As far as I am concerned no studies have been established about the same concept in Sn as an ambient space. Consequently, we deal throughout this article with this subject. Let A ⊂ Sn be a subset. A is convex if for each pair of points there exists a unique minimal geodesic segment [pq] joining p and q such that [pq] ⊂ A. If in addition ∂A does not contain any geodesic segments, then A is called strictly convex. For the pair of points p, q ∈ Sn if there exists a unique minimal closed geodesic segment joining p and q it will be denoted by [pq]. Moreover, (pq) = [pq] p, q will denote the open geodesic segment from p to q. The geodesic segment always exists {{if and only if}} p, q ∈ Sn are non-antipodal points. Definition 2. Let A ⊂ Sn be a subset. A has a <b>crosscut</b> with respect to the boundary points p, q ∈ ∂A if there exists a unique minimal closed geodesic segment [pq] joining p and q such that (pq) ⊂ Int(A). In the light of this definition the boundary points p, q should be antipodal points. Definition 3. A subset A ⊂ Sn has the <b>crosscut</b> property if A has a <b>crosscut</b> for each pair of boundary points. It is easy to show that every open geodesic ball with center p and radius r < pi/ 2 has-as a convex body in Sn—the <b>crosscut</b> property. If r = pi/ 2 we obtain an open hemishpere (also a convex body) with no <b>crosscuts...</b>|$|R
