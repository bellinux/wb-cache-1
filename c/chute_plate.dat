40|$|While {{studying}} environmental art, I reflected upon my {{own experiences}} {{related to the}} environment and its impact upon me. Largely, these experiences were gained while growing up on our family farm in Iowa, where the environment {{played an important role in}} life. The works produced during that study, related directly to those experiences. Some of the topics explored at that time pertained to: earth, erosion, and sedimentation; sights and smells of crops; and wind sounds. Initially, I felt some reticence in creating work about my experiences of the farm, fearing they might be considered too personal or too narrow. Nevertheless, I felt this work to be too crucial and too significant to allow my fears to curb its exploration. Sometime later, I became aware of having frequent recurrences of particular memories and images of the farm???events, places, objects which were indelibly etched in my mind. Sometimes these images occurred during changes in the weather, or seasons; from feelings of alienation, boredom, loneliness; or from missing my family and the farm. The recurrence and clarity of these images, and my personal identification with them, compelled me to focus upon them in my work. Initially, I drew the images, but soon discovered a need to express them in sculpture, which resulted in the first bas relief. I found this method to be a more effective means of expressing the nature and importance of these memories. The subject of this first bas relief (Plate I) was an old earthen root cellar, used to store fresh and canned fruits and vegetables from our orchard and garden. This ???cave???, as we called it, was frequented throughout the year. In the fall, it was visited for re-stocking; in the summer, for protection against threatening storms, as a unique respite from heat, as well as a personal hide-away. Working with these first images, through drawing relief sculpture, encouraged additional images from my past to come forth: The Kitchen (Plate II), The Bale Pile (Plates VI & VIII), The Barn (Plate VIII), The Loading <b>Chute</b> (<b>Plate</b> XI), The Oatfield (Plate XII), and others.

5000|$|Although {{they were}} {{effective}} ships in their intended role, {{the combination of}} high internal capacity and exceptionally high speed meant that they were equally valuable as fast transports. As such, for much of their service, they were used for running supplies, particularly men and mat√©riel, to isolated garrisons such as during the Siege of Tobruk and Malta in Operation Harpoon. With three funnels and {{the outline of a}} destroyer, [...] was camouflaged to appear like the Vichy French [...] "contre torpilleurs" [...] (large destroyers) [...] For this, a false bow was fitted, funnel caps were added, the mine <b>chutes</b> were <b>plated</b> over and a false deckline was painted on to camouflage the high flush-deck. Manxman received a similar disguise to pass for the Vichy cruiser Leopard so she could pass Corsica and mine the approaches to Livorno.|$|R
40|$|The use of rock boxes within {{conveyor}} transfers is not new, however, {{there is}} little published in the literature {{to aid in the}} design and implementation of rock boxes; instead mainly relying on prior knowledge and rules-of-thumb. A benefit of a rock box over other transfer types (e. g. soft loading <b>chutes</b> and impact <b>plates)</b> is their ability to capture material {{in such a way that}} it is only the initial feed of material which contacts chute walls or liners, with build-up of material creating a dominance of particle-particle interactions, thus reducing wear of the system and hence cost. This paper presents the preliminary results from an experimental rock box test program using polyethylene pellets, conducted on the variable geometry conveyor transfer research facility at the University of Wollongong. The position of the rock box, along with the belt speed and feed rate of material were varied to obtain a range of visual as well as quantifiable data. This paper also presents a series of discrete element modelling (DEM) simulations designed to predict the very same particle/bulk characteristics seen in the experimental test program in a view to determining whether accurate simulated predictions can be obtained. This simulation work involved the use of calibrated material models to ensure accuracy of all particle-particle and particle-geometry interactions. Initial minor discrepancies between the experimental and simulated results were investigated via input parameter adjustment to determine the root cause of the variations. The final comparisons still show some variation, however, investigations are ongoing...|$|R
