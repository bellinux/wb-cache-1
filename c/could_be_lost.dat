5|$|The council's {{budget for}} the {{financial}} year 2015/16 is £437.2m (down from £444.8m in 2014/15). The main source of non-school funding is the formula grant, which is paid by government to local authorities based on the services they provide. The remainder, to which the police and fire authorities (and parish council where this exists) set a precept, is raised from council tax and business rates. Following the 2010 Spending Review, the council announced that 11.1% could be cut from departmental budgets to save £65m {{over a five-year period}} and up to 181 posts <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>lost.</b>|$|E
5|$|There is {{speculation}} {{of several}} {{mechanisms by which}} the brain cells <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>lost.</b> One mechanism consists of an abnormal accumulation of the protein alpha-synuclein bound to ubiquitin in the damaged cells. This insoluble protein accumulates inside neurones forming inclusions called Lewy bodies. According to the Braak staging, a classification of the disease based on pathological findings, Lewy bodies first appear in the olfactory bulb, medulla oblongata and pontine tegmentum; individuals at this stage may be asymptomatic or may have early non-motor symptoms (such as loss of sense of smell, or some sleep or automatic dysfunction). As the disease progresses, Lewy bodies develop in the substantia nigra, areas of the midbrain and basal forebrain and, finally, the neocortex. These brain sites are the main places of neuronal degeneration in PD; however, Lewy bodies may not cause cell death {{and they may be}} protective (with the abnormal protein sequestered or walled off). Other forms of alpha-synuclein (e.g., oligomers) that are not aggregated in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites may actually be the toxic forms of the protein. In people with dementia, a generalized presence of Lewy bodies is common in cortical areas. Neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques, characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, are not common unless the person is demented.|$|E
25|$|At {{current rates}} of deforestation, {{more than half}} of Papua New Guinea's forests <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> or seriously {{degraded}} by 2021, according to a new satellite study of the region. Nearly one-quarter of Papua New Guinea's rainforests were damaged or destroyed between 1972 and 2002.|$|E

25|$|Captain Hoover wisely {{decided to}} save all the ships {{he could and}} decided not to stop to look for {{survivors}} - no one {{thought there would be}} any. Even if there were, the subs might still be around and more ships and men <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>lost.</b>|$|E
25|$|The 1965 Building Regulations {{introduced}} the first {{limits on the}} amount of energy that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> through certain elements of the fabric of new houses. This was expressed as a u-value—the amount of heat lost per square metre, for each degree Celsius of temperature difference between inside and outside.|$|E
25|$|On August 12, 2006, the ROH Pure Championship was unified {{with the}} ROH World Championship after ROH Pure Champion Nigel McGuinness lost to ROH World Champion Bryan Danielson in Liverpool, England in a title {{unification}} match. The match was contested under pure wrestling rules, with the stipulation that both championships <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> by disqualification or count out.|$|E

50|$|Foreigners in the Roman world <b>could</b> <b>be</b> {{attributed}} with virtus: If {{they fought}} bravely they <b>could</b> <b>be</b> {{said to have}} virtus. Virtus <b>could</b> also <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> in battle. Virtus <b>could</b> even <b>be</b> a cause to gain citizenship {{as in the case}} of Spanish cavalry men granted citizenship by Cn.

25|$|On 19 October 2010, the {{day before}} the {{spending}} review was announced in the House of Commons, Alexander was photographed reading a memo which showed {{that as a result of}} the cuts the government would be announcing up to 490,000 public service jobs <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>lost.</b> The figure contained within confidential briefing papers came from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).|$|E
25|$|One of the {{elements}} that Winnicott considered <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> in childhood was {{what he called the}} sense of being for him, a primary element, of which a sense of doing is only a derivative. The capacity for being the ability to feel genuinely alive inside, which Winnicott saw as essential to the maintenance of a true self was fostered in his view by the practice of childhood play.|$|E
25|$|These {{state offices}} <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> {{by a family}} at the {{unexpected}} death of the office holder. In an attempt to gain more tax revenues, the king's financial advisor, financier Charles Paulet, instituted the Paulette in 1604. This was a yearly tax of 1/60th {{of the price of}} the office that insured hereditary transmission. This annual tax solidified the hereditary acquisition of public office in France, and {{by the middle of the}} 17th century the majority of office holders were already noble from long possession of thereof.|$|E
25|$|Government {{officials}} {{today have}} {{no record of}} any such Naval Investigative Service report, although they suggest that it <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> or destroyed.

25|$|Intangible rights <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> or found, and the {{original}} common law rule <b>was</b> that there <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> a conversion of such. This restriction has been discarded for the most part. In the absence of contravening evidence, the measure of damages for conversion of a negotiable instrument usually is taken to be its face value.|$|R
50|$|Unmaintained figures {{gradually}} fade away. Firle Corn at Firle Beacon, Sussex <b>could</b> <b>be</b> a <b>lost</b> figure. Its {{existence is}} suggested by infrared photography. If it <b>is</b> a <b>lost</b> figure, its age is uncertain, and unlikely prehistoric in origin, as only one figure in the UK {{has been shown to}} be of this age, the Uffington White Horse.|$|R
25|$|Male mate {{guarding}} behaviour {{also needs}} {{to ensure that the}} mate does not leave the mateship as this would lose access to future chances that the male may have to reproduce. Moreover, the male would also lose any maternal efforts that the female would have invested in to any potential offspring. Additionally, access to any social benefits or helping networks that the female brought to the relationship <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>lost.</b> Finally, the female could also use information, such as strengths or weakness, about the male to exploit him in the future.|$|E
25|$|After a {{decision}} process ends, leaders should {{reflect on the}} process and try to derive lessons learned regarding how to manage conflict constructively. Since reflections can lead to new insight, individuals must take time to critically assess the experience. They also must address and repair any hurt feelings and damaged relationships {{that may not have}} been apparent during the process itself. If these relationships are not repaired, trust <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> which could negatively affect the effort of the next collaboration. Additionally, leaders should celebrate constructive conflict management and help others to remember the success of the process (Roberto, 2005).|$|E
25|$|Tactics of the {{battlefield}} were not complicated. Knights (along with their squires) stayed in close order formation with infantry on the flanks, and – after the initial shots of bowmen or crossbowmen – started the charge. In the same moment the commander – who was fighting {{at the head of}} the main detachment - usually lost control over the army and the battle degenerated into a melée in the scourge and disarray. In such circumstances the possibility of panic was the crucial element of the fight, and the battle - supposedly won - <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>lost.</b>|$|E
50|$|Private Izzy Murphy is a 1926 silent {{film with}} Vitaphone sound effects, {{starring}} George Jessel, and Patsy Ruth Miller. The film {{was released by}} Warner Bros..

25|$|Jack McConnell, as First Minister, {{entered the}} {{election}} defending a small overall majority of five seats via {{a coalition of}} Labour and the Liberal Democrats. The Scottish Executive coalition government had been in power, with three different First Ministers, since the first Scottish Parliament election in 1999. Opinion polls suggested its majority <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> in 2007, due to falling support for the Labour Party and rising support for other parties, in particular the Scottish National Party (SNP). The polls suggested that no single party was likely to acquire an overall majority, nor was there an obvious alternative coalition ready {{to form a new}} Executive.|$|E
25|$|Motivations {{behind the}} {{volunteering}} nature were not solely patriotic, but also commonly economic. Many men who joined as volunteers {{and went on}} to serve with the regular army were unemployed urban dwellers, and prospects of a standard income were better than none at all. Tradesmen could be sure to make a tidy profit from selling their wares to the soldiers, and sutlers often became camp followers, following a regiment, whilst on campaign. Certainly more applicable to the landed and wealthy gentlemen, fears of invasion also persuaded many to serve; not so much to support the nation as a whole, but to preserve their own interests, money and property which <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> if the enemy succeeded.|$|E
25|$|Although distinct, these ranks {{were not}} utterly {{exclusive}} castes {{like those of}} India. It was possible to rise or sink from one rank to another. Rising upward could be achieved a number of ways, such as by gaining wealth, by gaining skill in some department, by qualifying for a learned profession, by showing conspicuous valour, or by performing some service to the community. An example of {{the latter is a}} person choosing to become a briugu (hospitaller). A briugu had to have his house open to any guests, which included feeding no matter how big the group. For the briugu to fulfill these duties, he was allowed more land and privileges, but this <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> if he ever refused guests.|$|E
50|$|Each turn, the Games Master would award {{the player}} bonus points to be {{allocated}} between these statistics. Points <b>could</b> also <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> (in most games) by injury or by using MP to cast magical spells. Bonus points would be awarded {{depending on how}} well a character performed during a turn, but also on how well the player wrote the instructions. This <b>could</b> <b>be</b> entirely subjective and at the whim of the GM.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order for}} a {{conversion}} to occur, it used to need to <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> then found by some other person than the owner. In the process, {{it was possible that}} the property <b>could</b> <b>be</b> converted. Chattels converted have included a dog, money and tax receipts. Land <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> the subject of an action in trover, since it <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> <b>lost,</b> then found and converted. The same was true for sand and gravel, timber, crops and fixtures, so long as they were considered {{as a part of the}} land. No action in trover <b>could</b> <b>be</b> had. Once there was severance from the land, these became personal property, and trover <b>could</b> <b>be</b> entertained because of removal from the land.|$|R

25|$|When Welsh {{returned}} to America he {{was intent on}} fighting Ritchie, having failed to meet both Nelson and Wolgast. He employed the services of Harry Pollok, one of New York's most flamboyant sports impresarios. When Welsh and Fanny arrived in New York on 29 March 1913, Pollok was there orchestrating the reporters and photographers. Even with Pollack's help Ritchie was difficult to commit. Champions tended {{to stick to the}} East Coast, fighting in six round contests where the 'no-decision' contests meant the only way the title <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> would be through a knockout. When Welsh arrived in New York, Billy Dolan, Ritchie's manager, announced that the champion would not be fighting for four months as he was touring Europe to fulfil theatrical commitments. Welsh busied himself through fights, preparing for a possible title bid.|$|E
25|$|In {{the course}} of further testing, {{it was found that}} the Hurricane had poor spin {{recovery}} characteristics, in which all rudder authority <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> due to shielding of the rudder. Hawker's response to the issue was to request that spinning tests be waived, but the Air Ministry refused the request; the situation was resolved by the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE), who established that the aerodynamic problem had been caused by a breakdown of the airflow over the lower fuselage, and could be cured by the addition of a small ventral fairing and extension of the bottom of the rudder. This discovery had come too late for the changes to be incorporated in the first production aircraft, but were introduced upon the 61st built and all subsequent aircraft.|$|E
500|$|The panel used a DC-3 {{aircraft}} with a cockpit {{identical to}} that of VH-AET to carry out four flight tests with the gyroscope caged. [...] When the automatic pilot was engaged the control wheel moved forward so strongly it was torn from the pilot's hands, and regaining control required use of both hands and significant force. [...] Initial tests showed that when the pilot was unprepared, up to 600ft (183m) <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> before he identified the problem and disengaged the automatic pilot. [...] On the fourth test the pilot restricted the height loss to 300ft (91m). The panel considered the most likely explanation of the accident was inadvertent engagement of the automatic pilot with the gyroscope caged.|$|E
