Dental calculus is considered to play an influential role in periodontal disease. Little has been established about the oral factors which possibly influence rate of calculus formation. Some studies indicate salivary pH {{may play a role}} in this formation. Acknowledging the possible role of salivary pH, a study was needed to assess changes in bicarbonate and calcium-phosphorus levels (and subse-quent changes in calcium-phosphorus ion product) and their relationships to the dental calculus formation rate.

40|$|Context : The erratic {{lifestyle}} of resident doctors may affect their serum 25 -hydroxy vitamin D [25 -(OH) D] levels and bone mineral density (BMD). Aim : To study BMD {{and the effect}} of environmental factors on it in resident doctors. Settings and Design : Prospective, cross-sectional study conducted in a tertiary healthcare centre. Materials and Methods : BMD was obtained by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and was correlated with various factors including weight, height, body mass index (BMI), sun exposure, physical activity, parathyroid hormone, 25 -(OH) D, dietary factors. Statistical Analysis : SPSS software Version 10 (Unpaired t test was used to compare BMD of different groups and Pearson&#x 2032;s correlation coefficient was used to calculate correlation). Results : Two hundred and fourteen apparently healthy resident doctors were enrolled in the study. Based on Caucasian normative data, osteopenia was noted in 104 (59. 7 &#x 0025;) males and 27 (67. 5 &#x 0025;) females. Thirty-two (18. 39 &#x 0025;) males and five (12. 5 &#x 0025;) females had osteoporosis.

40|$|SUMMARY: The {{interrelation}} of <b>calcium</b> and <b>phosphorus</b> {{was evaluated}} {{as a function}} of bone material quality in femoral heads from male fragility fracture patients via surface analytical imaging as well as scanning microscopy techniques. A link between fragility fractures and increased <b>calcium</b> to <b>phosphorus</b> <b>ratio</b> was observed despite normal mineralization density distribution. INTRODUCTION: Bone fragility in men has been recently recognized as a public health issue, but little attention has been devoted to bone material quality and the possible efficacy in fracture risk prevention. Clinical routine fracture risk estimations do not consider the quality of the mineralized matrix and the critical role played by the different chemical components that are present. This study uses a combination of different imaging and analytical techniques to gain insights into both the spatial distribution and the relationship of <b>phosphorus</b> and <b>calcium</b> in bone. METHODS: X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and time-offlight secondary ion mass spectrometry imaging techniques were used to investigate the relationship between <b>calcium</b> and <b>phosphorus</b> in un-embedded human femoral head specimens from fragility fracture patients and non-fracture age-matched controls. The inclusion of the bone mineral density distribution via backscattered scanning electron microscopy provides information about the mineralization status between the groups. RESULTS: A link between fragility fracture and increased <b>calcium</b> and decreased <b>phosphorus</b> in the femoral head was observed despite normal mineralization density distribution. Results exhibited significantly increased <b>calcium</b> to <b>phosphorus</b> <b>ratio</b> in the fragility fracture group, whereas the nonfracture control group ratio was in agreement with the literature value of 1. 66 M ratio in mature bone. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the potential importance of the relationship between <b>calcium</b> and <b>phosphorus,</b> especially in areas of new bone formation, when estimating fracture risk of the femoral head. The determination of <b>calcium</b> and <b>phosphorus</b> fractions in bone mineral density measurements may hold the key to better fracture risk assessment as well as more targeted therapies. R.

During March and April 1999 â 2001, blood samples were collected from 158 female (73 adult, 85 yearling), free-ranging, prelaying, greater sage grouse from an area in northwestern Nevada, USA, and southeastern Oregon, USA. These blood samples were evaluated to establish normal blood values for sage grouse and ascertain if certain blood parameters, as indices of nutrition, are useful for predicting if sage grouse hens would raise at least one chick to 1 August. Results of logistic regression indicated that three of six blood parameters analyzedâglucose, total plasma protein, and <b>calcium</b> : <b>phosphorus</b> ratioâaffected the probability of a female sage grouse raising at least one chick to late summer. Ranking of the standardized estimates revealed that glucose and total plasma protein had the greatest impact on the likelihood of a female successfully raising chicks. Odds ratios indicated that a 1 -unit increase in glucose (1 mg/dl) and plasma protein (0. 1 g/dl) would result in a 4 % and 113 % positive increase, respectively, in the predicted odds of at least one chick surviving until 1 August. Odds <b>ratios</b> for <b>calcium</b> : <b>phosphorus</b> <b>ratio</b> revealed a 70 % decline in the predicted odds of at least one chick surviving until 1 August if the level of this parameter increased one unit (e. g., 3 : 1 to 4 : 1).

50|$|Osteophagy is the {{practice}} in which animals, usually herbivores, consume bones. Most vegetation around the world lacks sufficient amounts of phosphate. Phosphorus is an essential mineral for all animals, as it {{plays a major role}} in the formation of the skeletal system, and is necessary for many biological processes including: energy metabolism, protein synthesis, cell signaling, and lactation. Phosphate deficiencies can cause physiological side effects, especially pertaining to the reproductive system, as well as side effects of delayed growth and failure to regenerate new bone. The importance of having sufficient amounts of phosphorus further resides in the physiological importance of maintaining a proper <b>phosphorus</b> to <b>calcium</b> <b>ratio.</b> Having a Ca:P ratio of 2:1 is important for the absorption of these minerals, as deviations from this optimal ratio can inhibit their absorption. Dietary <b>calcium</b> and <b>phosphorus</b> <b>ratio,</b> along with vitamin D, regulates bone mineralization and turnover by affecting <b>calcium</b> and <b>phosphorus</b> transport and absorption in the intestine.|$|R

Vitamin D also plays a major role in calcium absorption and bone health because it helps to maintain calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism. Vitamin D deficiencies affect calcium homeostasis which in turn negatively impacts parts of the teeth including the gingivae, periodontal ligaments and the alveolar bone leading to degeneration of the teeth and jaw. According to the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) recommendations based on dry matter content, the maximum amount of calcium within a diet is 1.8% and the phosphorus content within a diet cannot exceed 1.6%. These recommendations ensure that the <b>calcium</b> to <b>phosphorus</b> <b>ratio</b> will be 1:1, or at max 2:1. AAFCO also states that the maximum amount of vitamin D within a canine diet cannot exceed 3000 IU/kg.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2013 Geophagy, the {{consumption}} of mineral soil, {{is believed to have}} several benefits for herbivores. Soils high in clay are often implicated in the detoxification of plant secondary metabolites. High mineral concentrations in soils may also provide nutrients that are poorly available from plants. Local observers report that snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) use a lick {{in the foothills of the}} Brooks Range, Alaska. Using soil from this lick and other mineral supplements, I conducted a series of feeding trials on captive snowshoe hares fed felt-leaf willow (Salix alaxensis) or a formulated ration to determine whether geophagy resulted in a physiological benefit and, if so, which soil constituents are therapeutic. When fed willow leaves, hares ate more and lost less weight when they had access to soil. Access to soil increased sodium intake and dietary ratios of sodium to potassium in hares fed willow. Soil consumption resulted in higher calcium to phosphorous ratios for both diets. Across diets, higher sodium to potassium and lower <b>calcium</b> to <b>phosphorus</b> <b>ratios</b> corresponded to reduced weight loss. Access to pure calcium carbonate resulted in reduced weight loss in hares fed winter dormant willow twigs, suggesting that carbonates may also be an important component of this lick...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} Lysine and {{essential}} fatty acid deficiencies on bone growth and development were studied in the rat. Forty 19 -day old female Wistar rats were divided into four groups of 10 rats each and fed the following diets respectively: (1) a diet adequate in both Lysine and EFA (+Lys+EFA); (2) a diet adequate in Lysine but deficient in {{essential fatty acid}} (+Lys-EFA); (3) a diet deficient in lysine but adequate in essential fatty acids (-Lys+EFA) and (4) a diet deficient in both essential fatty acids and Lysine (-Lys-EFA). Each group was placed on its diet for eight weeks. Bones were removed and the lipids estimated. (2) The mean body weights of rats on +Lys+EFA, -Lys+EFA and-Lys- EFA diets were 27. 9, 37. 2 and 49. 7 per cent respectively less than those maintained on the control diet. The lengths and weights of the rat bones were found to decrease in the order: -Lys-EFA> -Lys+EFA> +Lys-EFA> +Lys+EFA. Acidic phospholipids were considerably reduced in proportion in the deficient rat bones. The molar <b>calcium</b> to <b>phosphorus</b> <b>ratio</b> of bones of rats placed on different deficient diets was significantly low {{when compared with the}} controls.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 38 - 42) A {{study of}} 50 dental patients {{was made to}} determine if a correlation could be demonstrated between a high <b>ratio</b> <b>phosphorus</b> to <b>calcium</b> intake and the presence of periodontal disease. The study was based data from many researchers suggesting that bone demineralization is the result of chronic dietary deficiency of calcium and chronic dietary excess of phosphorus. A Periodontal Index (PI), based on visual data, was used to evaluate the severity of periodontal disease. The mean score was 1. 97 +, 88 SD. (0 -no detectable lesion: 8 -most severe). The CA:P was calculated from a 24 -hour dietary recall. The ratios ranged from 1 : 1 to 1 : 6. 4, with a mean of 1 : 2. 5, + 1. 16 SD. Protein intake was also studied because of its implication to bone loss in the body when consumed in large quantity. The mean intake was 76 g, + 35 SD. The diets were shown to be low in calcium, with the mean intake of 536 mg compared to the RDA of 800 mg RDA recommendation. The data obtained in this study collectively provided little evidence for a possible link of dietary <b>calcium</b> to <b>phosphorus</b> <b>ratio</b> or protein intake as prime etiologic factors in periodontal disease as no significant correlation could be demonstrated between the PI and the Ca:P ratios r=. 15113, or the PI and the protein scores r=. 09098...|$|R

40|$|There {{is ongoing}} {{research}} into calcium phosphate glasses as possible candidates {{for use in}} dental restoration and {{in the field of}} bone implants. This {{is due to the fact}} that calcium phosphate glasses have many useful properties such as bioactivity, biocompatibility, bioresorbability and non toxicity. However, on the other hand they are also known to fail catastrophically and therefore cannot be used in load bearing applications and are limited as coatings to metallic substrates. Calcium phosphate glasses with different types of oxides such as magnesium, [27 - 28, 30 - 34] sodium, [14, 36 - 40] fluorine [41 - 42] in the presence of titania have been used in research to investigate whether addition of these oxides can help improve the properties of the glasses. It has been shown that calcium phosphate glasses containing fluorine have shown to produce fluoroapatite which is beneficial as it is known to be one of the ways in order to improve chemical durability of calcium phosphate glass-ceramics. [41 - 42] In the present study, type A glass and glass-ceramics demonstrated the effect of TiO 2 addition with reduction of <b>calcium</b> to <b>phosphorus</b> <b>ratio</b> and type B glass and glass-ceramics demonstrated the effect of TiO 2 addition with constant <b>calcium</b> to <b>phosphorus</b> <b>ratio</b> on the structure of fluorine containing calcium phosphate glasses and glass-ceramics. The TiO 2 addition in type A took place in 5 %, 15 % and 20 % molar content of TiO 2 and in type B, TiO 2 was added to glasses in 4. 76 %, 11. 11 %, 16. 66 % and 20 % molar content of TiO 2. FTIR, DSC, XRD, ESEM and TGA (performed only on amorphous glasses) were used to characterise the glasses and glass-ceramics produced. DSC and density measurements showed that when 15 mol % TiO 2 was added in type A; it caused disruption in the glass network which was confirmed by a reduction in the Tg. When TiO 2 was added into the glass in type B, there was a general increase in Tg observed which confirmed that TiO 2 might strengthen the glass network. XRD results showed that in both type A and type B glass-ceramics, crystal phases corresponding to calcium metaphosphate, calcium pyrophosphate and titanium pyrophosphate were present. No phase however corresponding to fluorine was found. FTIR results of type A and type B glasses showed peaks corresponding to metaphosphate, pyrophosphate and orthophosphate groups. In the FTIR spectra of both the glass-ceramics however, peaks corresponding to the metaphosphate and pyrophosphate groups were decomposed into several narrow peaks. ESEM images demonstrated the presence of different crystal phases in the glass-ceramics. Titanium pyrophosphate was seen mainly at the surface of the glass-ceramics but in the bulk of the glass-ceramics, crystals corresponding to metaphosphate and pyrophosphate were observed. TGA and EDX analysis confirmed that unfortunately only some fluorine was retained in the amorphous glass and there was no crystalline phase that contained fluorine...|$|R

The objective of this survey was to determine some serum ionic and metabolic parameters and those relationships in 22 migratory population of Caspian lamprey in shirood river (a river located at the south of Caspian sea). There was no significant (P< 0. 05) difference between level of calcium (8. 52 Â± 2. 9 - 9. 14 Â± 0. 97 mg/dL), magnesium (2. 97 Â± 1. 04 - 2. 86 Â± 0. 97 mg/dL), phosphorus (11. 23 Â± 3. 18 - 13. 57 Â± 6. 61 mg/dL), Iron (0. 37 Â± 0. 19 - 0. 54 Â± 0. 3 mg/dL), total protein (4. 7 Â± 2. 47 - 5. 81 Â± 3. 85 g/dL), glucose (93. 98 Â± 22. 89 - 104. 10 Â± 32. 38 mg/dL) and cholesterol (164. 00 Â± 59. 19 - 170. 99 Â± 60. 77 mg/dL) in male and females. The correlation between magnesium with calcium (P< 0. 05) and cholesterol (P< 0. 05) and glucose (P< 0. 01) was significant. There was a significant correlation between phosphorus and total protein (P< 0. 05). The correlation between cholesterol with glucose (P< 0. 01) was significant. But correlation between total protein with magnesium to <b>phosphorus</b> <b>ratio</b> and <b>calcium</b> to <b>phosphorus</b> <b>ratio</b> (P< 0. 05), was invert. According to influences of ionic and metabolic bloodâs serum on regulation of reproduction and growth in Caspian lamprey, can use from these results in management of reproduction and culture of this endangered species and our results can help to more understand lampreys physiology in starvation time compare to other higher vertebrates.

We conducted {{this study to}} determine the concentration of the above-mentioned parameters and the correlation between {{them in order to}} optimize therapy with vitamin D in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. In 53 patients on hemodialysis due to ESRD, vitamin D [Calcidiol (25 (OH) D], parathyroid hormone (PTH), <b>calcium,</b> <b>phosphorus,</b> albuminuria, albumin:creatinine <b>ratio</b> (ACR) and other parameters have been followed up. Analysis of the levels of vitamin D has been carried out by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), the PTH is determined by the system Centaur XP, Siemens Diagnostic, Electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA), and for albumin in urine we used immunological method [Miltigent microalbumin assay (Abbott Laboratories Diagnostics). We found out deficiency and insufficiency of vitamin D in 56. 6 % and 37. 7 %, as well as average 4. 5 times increase in the PTH, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, albuminuria (A 2 or A 3), over 10 times increase in the ACR, secondary hyperparathyroidism. We registered a negative correlation between vitamin D and PTH. We confirmed the increase in creatinine and cystatin C in the patients on hemodialysis. There are few literature data for patients on hemodialysis, however, regarding the extent of the vitamin deficiency and its relationship with PTH, albuminuria, <b>calcium,</b> <b>phosphorus,</b> etc. Our data have indicated that patients on hemodialysis due to ESRD are associated with high incidence of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency...|$|R
