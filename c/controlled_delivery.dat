2500|$|The defendant, Jeffrey Grubbs, {{became the}} subject of an {{undercover}} federal investigation and prosecution when he ordered a videotape containing child pornography from a website operated by an undercover U.S. postal inspector. The Postal Inspection Service then arranged a <b>controlled</b> <b>delivery</b> of the tape to Grubbs. An application was submitted to a magistrate judge for the Eastern District of California requesting an [...] "anticipatory" [...] search warrant, so-called because it is based upon the probable cause that at some time in the future (but not at present) certain evidence of a crime will be located at a specified place). An affidavit accompanying the warrant application stated as the [...] "triggering condition" [...] that the search warrant would not be executed until the tape had been delivered and taken into Grubbs' home. However, this condition was omitted from the issued warrant. Two days later, the undercover delivery occurred and Grubbs' house was searched after the tape was taken inside. The videotape and other items were seized, and Grubbs was arrested.|$|E

He talked about lack of security and linkage between drug-trafficking and terrorism as well as profound corruption in {{the police and the}} army. His presentation highlighted the Ministry of the Interior's strategy in the field of counternarcotics. These included dismantling drug-trafficking networks/organizations, poppy eradication and crop substitution. Daud informed the participants that the [...] "poppy eradication force" [...] would complete its training soon and would be deployed to the southern provinces of Afghanistan. He noted that the force would be responsible for manually eradicating poppy plantations. He called for international support to continue with the poppy eradication programme and to expand the crop substitution programme to other provinces. The General suggested posting liaison officers to Pakistan, Iran and Tajikistan in order to foster international cooperation. Afghanistan had signed agreements with a number of countries and {{was in the process of}} signing memorandums of understanding with neighboring countries aimed at improving cooperation, information-sharing, and <b>controlled</b> <b>delivery</b> operations, according to the General.

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} how {{a particular}} vertical arrangement, Top of the Market Pricing (TOMP), can have horizontal anti-competitive effects. The theory is also applicable to other vertical arrangements {{in use in}} the fed cattle market. The theory changes the theoretical backdrop for examining captive supplies. Until now, a negative correlation between prices and captive supplies was theorized to result from a reduction in bidding aggressiveness on behalf of packers. The theory presented suggests why bidders maybe less aggressively when captive supplies are high. Furthermore, it eliminates debates over the appropriate time span over which to define captive supplies and whether feedlots or packers <b>control</b> <b>delivery.</b> <b>Delivery</b> <b>control</b> and <b>delivery</b> timing matter in the theory above only in the respect that packers must know cattle are committed prior to price being determined.
