40|$|Because {{of recent}} {{uncertainty}} {{in the price of}} fuel and also because of concerns over carbon emissions from aircraft, aeronautical engine manufacturers are exploring various alternative propulsors to the turbofan engine. One such propulsor is the advanced open rotor - which consists of two <b>coaxial,</b> counter-rotating <b>propellers,</b> and which promises a significant fuel burn reduction relative to current generation turbofan engines. However, in order for the open rotor to become a viable propulsor it must meet stringent noise emission targets. Therefore, having noise prediction tools which allow the quick and accurate assessment of the noise produced by a large number of advanced open rotor designs are a necessary part of the design process. Frequency domain formulae are often used for this purpose. These formulae contain a Fourier integral in the coordinate <b>coaxial</b> with the <b>propeller</b> axis, which in the near-field must be evaluated numerically at a high computational cost. For far-field noise predictions, and if it is assumed that the propeller operates in an environment with no scattering surfaces, then the Fourier integral can be evaluated in a relatively straight-forward manner, and at low computational cost, using the method of stationary phase. Consequently, most of the published literature regarding propeller and advanced open rotor noise ignores scattering from surrounding aircraft structures. In this paper methods for including the effect of scattering from structures such as the fuselage and the open rotor hub are presented. Some results showing the effect of scattering on the radiated sound field are also presented. <br/...|$|R

5000|$|The {{plane was}} {{conceived}} as a fast light bomber and reconnaissance plane. To obtain high speed and good aerodynamics, it was powered by two M-103 inline engines in tandem in a fuselage nose, driving two contra-rotating <b>coaxial</b> three-blade <b>propellers.</b> The design had quite unusual look, with long fuselage nose and a crew cab moved rearwards, towards double tailfin. Wings had a fighter-like form and their span was rather short. The VVIA under Bolkhovitinov was enlarged to tackle the expected problems {{in the design of}} the Bolkhovitnov S. The rear engine was geared to two high-speed shafts which passed either side of the forward engine to drive the rear propeller gearbox, whilst the forward engine and gearbox drove the forward propeller via shaft through the middle of the rear propeller gearbox. The structure of the S was predominantly light alloy stressed skin, the wing having two spars with heavy flush-rivetted upper and lower skins, and the fuselage built up from pre-formed upper, lower, and side panels attached to four longerons to give a strong but relatively simple structure to build. A total of 29 electrical actuators drove the Fowler Flaps, undercarriage, (rotating 90deg to lie flat in the wing), exit flap of the large common radiator duct, and many other services. The tail unit consisted of twin fins with rudders attached to the tips of the tailplane, variable geared elevators and separate servo and trim tabs on elevators, and rudders. Detail design of the aircraft began in 1937 and construction in July [...] The first prototype S-1 was built in 1939, but it was made in order to evaluate an airframe only and therefore was powered by only one engine M-103. It was unarmed and fitted with a fixed skid landing gear. It first flew on January 29, 1940, with B.N. Kudrin at the controls. A maximum speed was 400 km/h. The second prototype S-2 was powered by two engines and was armed with a single machinegun and bombs. Four 100 kg bombs were carried vertically in a bay between pilot and a rear gunner-navigator, under a common canopy. Its state testing started from March 20, 1940, and lasted until July 1940. A maximum speed reached was 570 km/h (354 mph). The plane had good handling, except for take-off and landing, which were difficult due to high wing loading. Its range and speed were also lower than estimated. As a result, it was decided to improve the plane further. However, the plane was not developed in a favour of next Bolkhovitinov designs.|$|R
40|$|In {{the desire}} to solve some of the {{challenges}} in personal transport and congestions in the cities, an investigation in to the specifications of a thruster based solution for hovering capabilities of a personal transport drone concept, has been conducted in this thesis. Also, a scaled test rig for evaluation and experimentation of propulsive function for a thruster was developed. The work in this thesis {{is presented in two}} parts, with the first part involving investigation for the drone concept, and the second part containing development and specifications of the experimental test rig. To evaluate the required specifications for a thruster design, a literature review of aerodynamics was conducted, starting with basic concepts and terms. Further, a review of propulsive theory within propellers and rotors were done. Existing and future concepts were also evaluated for inspiration and as a reference. The findings in theory, specifically blade element theory were implemented in a simplified theoretical tool. This tool was applied to the specification process to determine requirements in power, weight, and efficiency one can expect to lift and hover a payload that includes one person with in-built redundancy for safety. Next, a scaled experimental setup is developed to lay the foundation for future development of a full-scale thruster that can meet the requirements found {{in the first part of}} the thesis. The investigation in part one of this thesis laid the foundation for the development of the experimental test rig in Part Two. The development of the test rig, could not be done without the investigation and development of theoretical tools in Part One. The specification of the thruster unit in Part One was done under a regime of objectives that managed the specification process so that important properties such as safety and efficiency were maintained throughout the concept generation. The specification in Part One led to a selected layout of the thrusters through the use of development methodology with its origins from Pugh’s method. The preliminary specifications include a goal for efficiency, performance, total weight of the aircraft, and power requirements. Since the nature of the theory used in this thesis is ideal, the specifications in Part One are preliminary only. Also, using only the thrusters for generation of lift, requires a very high power consumption. The same development methodology was used in Part Two where key properties of the experimental test rig were defined and several concepts were generated and screened in a two-cycle process that yielded a best concept. This concept was constructed in CAD with full specifications and simulated for flow analysis. The main findings in Part One were the following: Assuming a gross weight of 450 kg, a thruster unit with two <b>coaxial</b> contra-rotating <b>propellers</b> will require a power of 50 kW and a total swept area of 2. 26 m 2. This gives a specific weight of 2. 25 kg/kW. The minimum power required for hovering is 18 kW for each thruster. For Part Two the results are: An experimental test rig for measuring thrust and torque produced by a propeller is designed with full specifications and technical drawings for a total cost of 595 000 NOK. A simple experimental plan overviewing method and experimental equipment is also found in this report. The rig is 1500 mm long, 1000 mm wide and 890 mm high without the propeller. Total weight is 29 kg. The test rig is optimized for the specified engine of 1 kW and the designed propeller of 600 mm, but is also capable of handling up to 3 kW of power, and up to 800 mm diameter propellers. The main challenge for future work, is to develop a dedicated program or code including vortex theory to accurately predict performance and generate design parameters for the propeller blades. This program should also be able to predict characteristics in forward flight. Also, an investigation in to how a wing area can be implemented in the drone/aircraft design to improve efficiency is recommended...|$|R
