5|$|Singaporeans are {{encouraged}} to display the national flag outside their homes during National Day celebrations, and residents' committees, particularly those of public housing estates, often arrange <b>co-ordinated</b> <b>displays.</b> However, some Singaporeans decline to do so as they associate it with the People's Action Party, the ruling party in Parliament, rather than with the nation. During the period beginning 1 July and ending on 30 September of each year, any person may, {{without the need for}} the approval of the Minister under paragraph (4), incorporate the Flag or an image thereof as part of any costume or attire except that he shall do so in a manner that does not give rise to any disrespect to the Flag.|$|R

50|$|Meanwhile, Coulson's team (including Triplett) {{abandon the}} Hub when the {{military}} is dispatched to capture the remaining SHIELD bases. Coulson's badge <b>displays</b> <b>co-ordinates</b> which he believes have been sent by Nick Fury, and he decides to follow the co-ordinates to the Canadian wilderness. The others are worried about his state of mind, with May concerned that Hydra may have used TAHITI to hijack Coulson's brain, if the agent overseeing the project was a sleeper agent. They search the wilderness and find a secret base, Providence, manned by communications specialist agent Eric Koenig, who initially tells the team that Fury is dead, but privately informs Coulson of his survival.|$|R
5000|$|In September 1945, only a {{month after}} the end of the war, the Council {{announced}} a national exhibition of design [...] "in all the main range of consumer goods" [...] to be held the following year. This was the 1946 Britain Can Make It exhibition, organized largely at the instigation of the Council's director, S.C. Leslie. The design of the exhibition itself was <b>co-ordinated</b> by Chief <b>Display</b> Designer, James Gardner. The exhibition was held from September to November at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Part of the reason for choosing this venue was that many of the museum's main exhibits were still in their wartime evacuation storage, outside London. The venue was undamaged by bombing, empty and available, and itself in need of an attraction to restore its pre-war visitors.|$|R
40|$|The {{features}} of the special physical training of archers are considered from a bow {{on the stage of}} the specialized base training. To research 45 sportsmen (24 youths and a 21 girls) were brought over from the anchorwomen of sporting schools of Ukraine (Lvov, Kharkov). Testing of leading physical qualities is conducted for archery. It is set that the special physical training of sportsmen is characterized prevailing of displays of power qualities. It is not discovered differences for the <b>displays</b> of <b>co-ordinating</b> capabilities (complex <b>display,</b> feelings of the bow) and separate power qualities (force of bow, multiple traction of bow) on gender features. It is set that skilled sportsmen do not show the proper level of contiguous development of co-ordinating and power qualities. Recommended for the training process of skilled sportsmen is an increase of volume of exercises with the directed development of co-ordinating capabilities...|$|R
40|$|A {{myopathy}} in the Great Dane {{dog with}} characteristic pathological and molecular features is reported. Young adults present with progressive weakness and generalised muscle atrophy. To better define this condition, an investigation using histopathology, confocal microscopy, biochemistry and microarray analysis was undertaken. The skeletal muscles of affected dogs exhibited increased oxidative fibre phenotype and core fibre lesions characterised by {{the disruption of}} the sarcomeric architecture and the accumulation of mitochondrial organelles. Affected muscles <b>displayed</b> <b>co-ordinated</b> expression of genes consistent with a slow-oxidative phenotype, which was possibly a compensatory response to chronic muscle damage. There was disruption of Z-lines in affected muscles which, at the molecular level, manifested as transcriptional dysregulation of several Z-line associated genes, including alpha-actinin, myotilin, desmin, vimentin and telethonin. The pathology of this canine myopathy is distinct from that of human central core myopathies that are characterised by cores devoid of mitochondria and {{by the presence of}} myofibrillar breakdown products...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Plasmodium falciparum -parasitized {{red blood}} cells (RBCs) are {{equipped}} with protective antioxidant enzymes and heat shock proteins (HSPs). The latter are only considered to protect against thermal stress. Important issues are poorly explored: first, it is insufficiently known how both systems are expressed {{in relation to the}} parasite developmental stage; secondly, it is unknown whether P. falciparum HSPs are redox-responsive, in view of redox sensitivity of HSP in eukaryotic cells; thirdly, it is poorly known how the antioxidant defense machinery would respond to increased oxidative stress or inhibited antioxidant defense. Those issues are interesting as several antimalarials increase the oxidative stress or block antioxidant defense in the parasitized RBC. In addition, numerous inhibitors of HSPs are currently developed for cancer therapy and might be tested as anti-malarials. Thus, the joint disruption of the parasite antioxidant enzymes/HSP system would interfere with parasite growth and open new perspectives for anti-malaria therapy. Methods Stage-dependent mRNA expression of ten representative P. falciparum antioxidant enzymes and hsp 60 / 70 – 2 / 70 – 3 / 75 / 90 was studied by quantitative real-time RT-PCR in parasites growing in normal RBCs, in RBCs oxidatively-stressed by moderate H 2 O 2 generation and in G 6 PD-deficient RBCs. Protein expression of antioxidant enzymes was assayed by Western blotting. The pentosephosphate-pathway flux was measured in isolated parasites after Sendai-virus lysis of RBC membrane. Results In parasites growing in normal RBCs, mRNA expression of antioxidant enzymes and HSPs <b>displayed</b> <b>co-ordinated</b> stage-dependent modulation, being low at ring, highest at early trophozoite and again very low at schizont stage. Additional exogenous oxidative stress or growth in antioxidant blunted G 6 PD-deficient RBCs indicated remarkable flexibility of both systems, manifested by enhanced, co-ordinated mRNA expression of antioxidant enzymes and HSPs. Protein expression of antioxidant enzymes was also increased in oxidatively-stressed trophozoites. Conclusion Results indicated that mRNA expression of parasite antioxidant enzymes and HSPs was co-ordinated and stage-dependent. Secondly, both systems were redox-responsive and showed remarkably increased and co-ordinated expression in oxidatively-stressed parasites and in parasites growing in antioxidant blunted G 6 PD-deficient RBCs. Lastly, as important anti-malarials either increase oxidant stress or impair antioxidant defense, results may encourage the inclusion of anti-HSP molecules in anti-malarial combined drugs. </p...|$|R
