40|$|Two {{types of}} non-axial <b>crushing,</b> {{off-axis}} <b>crushing</b> and angled <b>crushing,</b> {{have been identified}} and significant differences found between the E-glass/polyester pultruded tubes <b>crushed</b> in these different configurations. Energy absorption for {{the two types of}} <b>crushing</b> was found also to vary significantly with the angle of inclination, with the difference being largest at high angles of inclination. Reasons for energy absorption differences between the <b>crushing</b> configurations include the initiation of different crack patterns, different loading of individual fibers, and altered friction.

40|$|The {{effects of}} crushing-surface {{roughness}} on the energy-absorption capability of graphite and glass-epoxy composite tubes were investigated. Fifty {{different combinations of}} fiber, matrix, and specimen ply orientation were evaluated. Two different <b>crushing</b> surface roughnesses were used in this investigation. <b>Crushing</b> surface significantly influences the energy-absorption capability only of tubes that <b>crush</b> in the lamina bending <b>crushing</b> mode; tubes that <b>crush</b> in other modes are not influenced because their lamina bundles do not slide against the <b>crushing</b> surface. Those tubes that <b>crush</b> in the lamina bending mode can achieve higher, lower, or no change in energy-absorption capability as <b>crushing</b> surface roughness increases. If the fiber failure strain of tubes that <b>crush</b> in the lamina bending <b>crushing</b> mode exceeds the matrix failure strain then the energy-absorption capability increases as <b>crushing</b> surface roughness increases. However, if the matrix failure strain exceeds the fiber failure strain then the energy-absorption capability increases as <b>crushing</b> surface roughness decreases. Energy-absorption capability is uninfluenced by <b>crushing</b> surface roughness for tubes that have equal fiber and matrix failure strains...|$|R

40|$|Wear in rock crushers causes great {{costs in}} the mining and {{aggregates}} industry. Change of the geometry of the <b>crusher</b> liners is {{a major reason for}} these costs. Being able to predict the geometry of a worn <b>crusher</b> will help designing the <b>crusher</b> liners for improved performance. A model for prediction of sliding wear was suggested by Archard in 1953. Tests have been conducted to determine the wear coefficient in Archard's model. Using a small jaw <b>crusher,</b> the wear of the <b>crusher</b> liners has been studied for different settings of the <b>crusher.</b> The experiments have been carried out using quartzite, known for being very abrasive. <b>Crushing</b> forces have been measured, and the motion of the <b>crusher</b> has been tracked along with the wear on the <b>crusher</b> liners. The test results show that the wear mechanisms are different for the fixed and moving liner. If there were no relative sliding distance between rock and liner, Archard's model would yield no wear. This is not true for rock <b>crushing</b> applications where wear is observed even though there is no macroscopic sliding between the rock material and the liners. For this reason, Archard's model has been modified to account for the wear induced by the local sliding of particles being <b>crushed.</b> The predicted worn geometry is similar to the real <b>crusher.</b> A cone <b>crusher</b> is a machine commonly used in the mining and aggregates industry. In a cone <b>crusher,</b> the geometry of the <b>crushing</b> chamber is crucial for performance.
