Onyeani ignores the wealth divide in China and India, nations he deems successful because of their accomplishments in the manufacture of goods.

[...] Bedigian noted the game's complete lack of vehicle damage and wrote [...] "though we love to see explosions and body damage, it's doubtful that any amount of destruction would have made this game better. <b>Chances</b> <b>are</b> <b>it</b> would have taken away from the overall speed of the game, which is generally a non-stop experience." [...] However, Bedigian criticized some of the game's courses for being too dark in color: [...] "Since the PSP has limited picture-tweaking features, you can't lighten the screen to entirely eliminate the darkness. The opposite wouldn't have been better - make the game too bright and you'll drive us crazy. But while this was something I could tolerate, I'm not sure an impatient eight-year-old will feel the same way." [...] Bedigian also criticized the game's small amount of courses, but felt that its replayability was adequate compensation.|$|E

50|$|Crime Pattern Theory {{is a way}} of {{explaining}} why crimes are committed in certain areas. Crime is not random, it is either planned or opportunistic. According to the theory crime happens when the activity space of a victim or target intersects with the activity space of an offender. A person’s activity space consists of locations in everyday life, for example home, work, school, shopping areas, entertainment areas etc. These personal locations are also called nodes. The course or route a person takes to and from these nodes are called personal paths. Personal paths connect with various nodes creating a perimeter. This perimeter is a person’s awareness space.Crime Pattern Theory claims that a crime involving an offender and a victim or target can only occur when the activity spaces of both cross paths. Simply put crime will occur if an area provides opportunity for crime and it exists within an offender’s awareness space. Consequently, an area that provides shopping, recreation and restaurants such as a shopping mall has a higher rate of crime. This is largely due to the high amount of potential victims and offenders visiting the area and the various targets in the area. It is highly probable that an area like this will have a lot of car theft because of all the traffic {{in and out of the}} area. It is also probable that people may fall victim of purse snatching or pick pocketing because victims typically carry cash with them. Therefore, crime pattern theory provides analysts an organized way to explore patterns of behaviour.Criminals come across new opportunities for crime every day. These opportunities arise as they go to and from personal nodes using personal paths. For example, a victim could enter an offender’s awareness space by way of a liquor store parking lot or a new shopping center being built. If the shopping center is being built in an area where crime occurs a couple of miles away, <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> <b>it</b> will exist in some if not all offender’s awareness space. This theory aids law enforcement in figuring out why crime exists in certain areas. It also helps predict where certain crimes may occur.|$|E
