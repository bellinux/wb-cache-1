60|$|If I am mistaken about these, please <b>correct</b> <b>me</b> as I do {{not wish}} to appear where I should not.|$|E
6000|$|... "May I {{count on}} your ladyship's, {{kindness}} to <b>correct</b> <b>me</b> if my own ignorant calculations {{turn out to}} be wrong?" [...] Grace asked, innocently.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am married, Esther," [...] she returned, coldly <b>correcting</b> <b>me,</b> [...] "and am Mrs. Chadband. Well! I {{wish you}} good day, and I hope you'll do well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'To Smith,' he <b>corrected</b> <b>me.</b> 'What {{judge would}} that howling little blackguard be of a woman's worth! The dislike {{of such a}} man as that is a {{testimonial}} to her merit!' ...|$|R
6000|$|Emma laughed, and replied: [...] "But I had the {{assistance}} of all your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people. I doubt whether my own sense would have <b>corrected</b> <b>me</b> without it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The constable will <b>correct</b> <b>me</b> if I am wrong," [...] said Rupert, looking sweetly at the ceiling. [...] "It was: The Elms, Buxton Common, near Purley, Surrey." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "From the {{testimony}} of the accuser I gather that he found this money in a road more than two years ago. <b>Correct</b> <b>me,</b> sir, if I misunderstood you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{the money}} so found was never {{out of his}} hands thenceforth up to a certain {{definite}} date--the last day of last year. <b>Correct</b> <b>me,</b> sir, if I am wrong." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, hardly alone," [...] she <b>corrected</b> <b>me,</b> while a look {{of patient}} {{resignation}} added dignity to her piquant features. [...] "You see, there are the dear children always round about me, during the holidays." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Janet!" [...] exclaimed the Countess; [...] "right, thou hast <b>corrected</b> <b>me</b> justly. Such reports, blighting the {{reputation}} of England's brightest and noblest peer, can only find currency amongst the mean, the abject, and the infamous!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have <b>corrected</b> <b>me</b> justly, madam," [...] said Margaret calmly; [...] "I ought only to {{have spoken}} of my present state of mind, as what will last me for my lifetime, which unquestionably may be but short." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>correct</b> <b>me,</b> indeed!" [...] said Miss Betsy, {{turning up}} her nose, if possible, higher than before; [...] "I {{should like to}} see you erect me! Imperence!" [...] and they all began laffin again.|$|E
60|$|Such is the {{language}} in which I have addressed a halting friend-- halting, yet with his face toward the right path. If I have erred, enable me to see my error. <b>Correct</b> <b>me,</b> or confirm me. Farewell.|$|E
60|$|You {{have now}} my entire mind on this momentous question, the grounds {{on which it}} rests, and the motives which induce me to make it known; and I now {{conclude}} by repeating my request: <b>Correct</b> <b>me,</b> or confirm me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} {{hear you}} say that," [...] he said, heartily. [...] "I used those words because I have been forced to say them so often. They really are contemptible. Thanks for <b>correcting</b> <b>me,</b> dear old boy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, that's what I mean," [...] said Lemuel. [...] "I presume it ain't perfect--isn't, I should say," [...] and Sewell smiled. [...] "Mr. Corey {{was always}} <b>correcting</b> <b>me</b> on that. But if I {{were to do}} nothing but pass along the good that's been done me since I came here, I should be kept busy {{the rest of my}} life." ...|$|R
6000|$|The extravagant cheerfully <b>corrected</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "They {{will not}} sorrow: but I shall return to them. Of their grudged pension I have eighteenpence in my pocket. But I propose {{to travel with}} Sheepshanks, and raise the wind by showing his tricks. He shall toss the caber from Land's End to Forthside, cheered by the plaudits of the {{intervening}} taverns and furthered by their bounty." ...|$|R
6000|$|Thus {{you have}} the story. If I come short in any circumstance, I beg pardon of those that can <b>correct</b> <b>me.</b> It is three or four and twenty years since I saw the book; yet I have, {{as far as my}} memory will admit, given you the {{relation}} of the matter. However, Luke, as you see, doth here present you with the substance of the whole.21 ...|$|E
6000|$|VIRAG: Number two on {{the other}} hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. <b>Correct</b> <b>me</b> but I always {{understood}} that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right? ...|$|E
60|$|Having {{answered}} {{all that}} I think liable to objection, and recollected what I had omitted, I desire to stand or {{fall by the}} judgment of the serious part of mankind; wherein they shall <b>correct</b> <b>me</b> I will kiss the rod and suffer with patience; but if a pack of hackney scribblers shall attack me only by way of a get-penny, I shall not be provoked to answer them, be they never so scurrilous, lest I be accounted as one of them.|$|E
5000|$|Clement Freud wrote {{a memoir}} in which, {{according}} to journalist Harriet Lane, [...] "there {{are a few}} moments when indignation or irritation surge to the surface. In conversation, {{he is prepared to}} go further. In the book, for instance, he fudges his parents' non-appearance at his 1950 church wedding to actress Jill Raymond (who now runs two theatre companies in Suffolk). My interpretation had been that they had not been invited. But he <b>corrects</b> <b>me</b> on this. They were asked but chose, as atheists, not to attend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is the originall {{manuscript}} of the History, <b>corrected</b> by <b>me,</b> and given into {{the custody of}} Mrs. Martha Whiteway by me Jonathan Swift, June 15, 1737. seven.|$|R
5000|$|He had the geniality of the {{politician}} {{who for years}} {{has gone out of}} his way to be cordial with everyone he meets. He talked very good English, fluently, with a copious choice of words, and he put what he had to say plainly, and with logical sequence. He had a resonant voice and an easy manner. He did not agree with a good deal that I said and <b>corrected</b> <b>me</b> with decision, but with courtesy that took it for granted I was too intelligent to be affronted by contradiction ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thank you, my lord," [...] {{continued}} the brigadier, [...] "as your lordship's high authority makes my case {{so much the}} stronger. It is, then, settled law, gentle monikins of the jury, that the sovereign of this realm can do no wrong. It is also settled law--their lordships will <b>correct</b> <b>me,</b> if I misstate--it is also settled law that the sovereign is the fountain of honor, that he can make war and peace, that he administers justice, sees the laws executed--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I fear you undervalue yourself, my dear guest," [...] he said. [...] "Recently have I {{returned}} from America, where I was told {{much of the}} wealth of Signor John Merreek, who is many times a millionaire. See," [...] drawing a paper from his pocket, [...] "here {{is a list of}} the stocks and securities you own. Also of government and railway bonds, of real estate and of manufactures controlled by your money. I will read, and you will <b>correct</b> <b>me</b> if an error occurs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And if I might rise to order,' {{said the}} barber {{in a soft}} voice, and looking round him with a conciliatory smile as he leant over the table, with the {{knuckles}} {{of his left hand}} resting upon it, - 'if I MIGHT rise to order, I would suggest that [...] "barbers" [...] is not exactly the kind of language which is agreeable and soothing to our feelings. You, sir, will <b>correct</b> <b>me</b> if I'm wrong, but I believe there IS such a word in the dictionary as hairdressers.' ...|$|E
5000|$|The house was, under Mrs Delany, a {{centre of}} Dublin's {{intellectual}} life. Swift {{is said to}} have composed many of his campaigning pamphlets while staying there. He and his life - long companion Stella were both in the habit of visiting, and Swift satirised the grounds which he considered too small for the size of the house. Through her correspondence with her sister, Mrs Dewes, Mary wrote of Swift in 1733: [...] "he calls himself my master and <b>corrects</b> <b>me</b> when I speak bad English or do not pronounce my words distinctly".|$|R
6000|$|So I kissed him, {{not without}} fear, {{for the old}} man was unearthly. Then he sent Karema from the place and bade me tell him my story, which I did. Why he did this I cannot say, since he seemed to know it already and once or twice <b>corrected</b> <b>me</b> in certain matters that I had forgotten, for {{instance}} as to the exact words that I had used to the Great King in my rage and as to the fashion in which I was tied in the boat. When I had done, he said, ...|$|R
40|$|I {{would like}} to express my {{gratitude}} {{to all those who}} gave me the possibility to complete this thesis. I want to thank the Florida Department of Transport safety office for giving me permission to use their database to extract data for this research. Special thanks should go to Pat Brady, Benjamin Jacobs and Charles Anderson who were readily available to give me access to their database. I am deeply indebted to my supervisor Prof. Dr. Renatus Mussa whose help, stimulating suggestions and encouragement helped me in all the time of research for and writing of this thesis. My sincere thanks also go to Dr. John Sobanjo and Lisa Spainhour who were my committee members in this research. They were available all the time to give me some directives and <b>corrected</b> <b>me</b> where was required. I would like also to thank my fellow research members at traffic laboratory who were with me all the time, giving me new ideas, and <b>correcting</b> <b>me</b> several times. I {{would like to}} thank Mr. Victor Muchuruza for his tremendous job in giving me new ideas in modeling and analysis. I would like also to thank Mr. Thobias Sando for his spiritual advices and Valerian Kwigizile who was my office mate. My final thanks go to Sprinkle Consulting who were the consultants for this project...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I {{will say}} it, husband, {{though it is}} but my guess, for I have had no words with Foy or Martin, and if I am wrong they can <b>correct</b> <b>me.</b> I know their faces, and I think with you {{that they are not}} {{speaking}} the truth. I think that they do not wish us to know it--not that they may keep the secret of this treasure for themselves, but because such a secret might well bring those who know of it to the torment and the stake. Is it not so, my son?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then, naturally, {{the thought}} {{would come into}} the mind of a wise and serious man--I punish my child, or my dog, and God punishes me. May he not punish me {{for the same reason that}} I punish them? I punish them to correct them and make them better. Surely God punishes me, to <b>correct</b> <b>me,</b> and make me better. I punish my child, because I love him, and wish him good. God punishes me because he loves me and desires that I may be a partaker of his holiness.|$|E

[...] she exclaimed, without waiting for {{response}} from me. [...] "In order to flirt with a member of the sisterhood, a gentleman must direct his attentions to the Mother Superior who represents them, and the flirting is thus done by proxy. Now don't attempt to <b>correct</b> <b>me.</b> The idea is entirely too delightful for me to allow it to be destroyed by any bare statements or assertions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{did most}} of the talking. I asked her to speak slowly, as I did not manage to catch the sense of what she said. She seems full of fun, and a jolly little woman altogether. She {{generally}} understood what I meant, and though she could not help laughing sometimes, she did it so good- temperedly that one did not feel put out. Each time I spoke she <b>corrected</b> <b>me,</b> told me what I ought to have said, and made me say it after her. I think I shall get on fairly well {{at the end of a}} few weeks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Another day," [...] {{continues}} Prince de Ligne, [...] "the Manoeuvres {{being over}} in good time, {{there was a}} Concert at the Kaiser's. Notwithstanding the King's taste for music, he was pleased {{to give me the}} preference; and came where I was, to enchant me with the magic of his conversation, and the brilliant traits, gay and bold, which characterize him. He asked me to name the general and particular Officers who were present, and to tell him those who had served under Marshal Traun: 'For, ENFIN,' he said, 'as I think I have told you already, he is my Master; he <b>corrected</b> <b>me</b> in the Schooling I was at.' ...|$|R
5000|$|On 23 May, when BTC News {{reporter}} Eric Brewer {{asked him}} about his 16 May statement, McClellan said: Let <b>me</b> <b>correct</b> you... let <b>me</b> <b>correct</b> you on the characterisation of the quote you attributed to me.
