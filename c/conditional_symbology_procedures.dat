More than simply a computer graphics display, electronic chart systems combine both geographic and textual data into a readily useful operational tool. Electronic charts are a real-time navigation system that integrates a variety of information that is displayed and interpreted by the mariner. IHO Special Publication 52 (IHO-S- 52) is the IHO Specification for Chart Content and Display of ECDIS. It includes appendices describing the means/process for updating, color and symbol specifications. Electronic charts automate the process of integrating real-time positions with the chart display and allow the navigator to continuously assess the position and safety of the vessel. This paper discussed the key problems, which will provide the theoretical foundation and practical experience. On the bases of analyzing the S- 52 standard, this paper discussed the key technology in the Electronic chart display system, including such follows: Propose a new automatic assignment symbols which consist of points, lines and areas. According to the S- 57 standard and S- 52 standard, it is decided by the objects attribute when a symbol was shown. In {{order to meet the}} marinerâ€™s evolving requirements, it should be designed with enough flexibility. It contains <b>conditional</b> <b>symbology</b> <b>procedures</b> for cases where symbolizing depends on circumstance, such as the mariner can select a safety depth or safety contour. For a safety depth, all soundings {{less than or equal to}} the safety depth are emphasized. For a safety contour, ECDIS highlights this contour over other depth contours.
