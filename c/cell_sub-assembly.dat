40|$|Assembly {{lines and}} {{cellular}} manufacturing systems (CMSs) design {{have been widely}} used in the literature. However the integration of these manufacturing concepts is neglected in an environment where parts need to be assembled after production in different shops. In this paper, a comprehensive quadratic assignment problem is developed for the assignment of machines of each part manufacturing <b>cell,</b> <b>sub-assembly</b> tasks of each sub-assembly cell as well as the assignment of different cells and final assembly tasks within the shop floor in their relevant predetermined locations. A genetic algorithm (GA) as well as a memetic algorithm (MA) consisting of the proposed GA and Tabu search (TS) algorithm are proposed and implemented on different size numerical examples. The obtained results show the efficiency of both algorithms to reach near optimal solutions compared to the optimal solution of small-sized problems. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} {{and a system}} for {{assembling}} a Photovoltaic, PV, module having a plurality of stacked, aligned layers, wherein a sub-assembly is formed at least including a first layer comprised of a first fusible foil, and a second layer comprised of a plurality of PV <b>cells.</b> The <b>sub-assembly</b> is pre-heated at discrete locations, such that the layers thereof are fixated at such discrete locations. The sub-assembly and the other layers are staked in an aligned relationship, handled and transported for fusing and curing of the layers together in heating station so as to provide the laminated assembled PV modul...|$|R
5000|$|A {{simple but}} rather {{complete}} description of cell implementation {{comes from a}} 1985 booklet of 96 pages by Kone Corp. in Finland, producer of elevators, escalators, and the like. Excerpts follow: [...] "The first step involved creating cells in the assembly, electrical and chemical testing departments. In April 1984 six cells, identified by different colors, were established... All devices manufactured in cells are identified by the cell's color, and all feed-back from quality control is directed straight to the workers of the cell concerned... The second step, in summer, 1984, was to [...] "cellularize" [...] manufacture of the analyzer subassemblies are needed in the analyzer cells, and to test them if necessary. Production of the five <b>sub-assembly</b> <b>cells</b> consists exclusively of certain analyzer sub-units. The parts and materials {{are located in the}} cells... Material control between the cells is based on the pull system and actual demand. In the analyzer cells there is a buffer consisting of two pieces for each (roughly 25 different) sub-unit. When one piece is taken into assembly, a new one is ordered from the corresponding unit-cell. The order is made using a magnetic kanban button, which identifies the ordering cell (by color), unit (by code), and order date... When the manufacturing cell has completed the order, the unit is taken with the kanban button to its place on the ordering cell shelf. Orders from the unit cells to the sub-cells are based on the same principle. The only difference is that the buffer size is six sub-units. This procedure was implemented in August, 1984." ...|$|R
