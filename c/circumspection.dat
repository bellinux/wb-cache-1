Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Salem (1999), Salem, a citizen of Libya, was granted temporary admission to the UK to pursue an asylum claim. One month later, the Home Office recorded in an internal file that Salem's asylum claim had been refused, but did not communicate the decision to him. Salem only found out when his income support ceased, and the Benefits Agency told him that they had been informed that he had been refused asylum. Subsequently, Salem unsuccessfully sought leave to apply for judicial review of the Home Secretary's decision to notify the Department of Social Security that his asylum claim had been rejected. He then obtained leave to appeal the matter to the House of Lords, but was then granted refugee status. Before the House of Lords, Salem argued that his appeal should still be heard as the question of law in his case was one of general public importance. The court held that it had discretion to hear an appeal which concerns an issue involving a public authority as to a question of public law, even where {{there is no longer any}} live issue which would affect the rights and duties of the parties themselves. However, the court cautioned that this discretion has to be exercised with <b>circumspection</b> and entertained only where there was a good public interest reason to do so. It is not yet known whether the Singapore High Court will adopt a similar approach.|$|E

The mpomponsuo (responsibility) sword of the Asantehene, for example, has an embossment of a coiled snake with {{a bird in}} its mouth. This conveys the Ashanti message: nanka bobonya mede asase anya onwam – the puff adder that cannot fly has caught the hornbill that flies. This is used to symbolize patience, prudence, and <b>circumspection.</b>|$|E
25|$|A Venetian {{ambassador}} of {{that time}} praised Marguerite as knowing all the secrets of diplomatic art, hence {{to be treated with}} deference and <b>circumspection.</b> Marguerite's most remarkable adventure involved freeing her brother, King Francis I, who had been held prisoner in Spain by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor after being captured in the Battle of Pavia, Italy, 1525. During a critical period of the negotiations, Queen Marguerite rode horseback through wintry woods, twelve hours a day for many days, to meet a safe-conduct deadline, while writing her diplomatic letters at night.|$|E

500|$|On July 31, 1693, Phips hosted at {{his house}} {{a meeting of the}} General Council, {{including}} Stoughton and four other O judges, and read a letter that had arrived the day before from the queen. The letter supported Phips in his ending of the trials, and stated that 'the greatest moderation and all due <b>circumspection</b> be used..." [...] No doubt, Phips wanted the letter read into the official minutes, but by hosting the meeting {{at his house}}, one wonders if he was not trying to provoke, especially if his own wife had been among the accused.|$|E
500|$|Context is {{one other}} element to framing that is essential. [...] "The {{participants}} will be bound by norms of good manners: through frequency and length of turns at talk, through topics avoided, through <b>circumspection</b> in regard to references about self, through attention offered eagerly or begrudgingly-through all these means, rank and social relationship will be given their due." [...] Certain things can and will be said in one scenario that would never be uttered in another. An awareness of these social framings is critical, just as is {{an awareness of the}} audience. Depending on who you’re speaking with (a teacher, a child, a loved one, a friend, a pet, etc.) you will curve your speech to fit the frame of what your intended audience is expecting.|$|E

During the tongue-in-cheek speech, he made sarcastic references about his {{need to go to}} the US for health treatment. He told a journalist that he would accept [...] "any position which is useful for the country", leading some to think that he wanted Kỳ or Thiệu's job. According to Time magazine, Thi's speeches showed he [...] "was obviously torn between a desire to rally support for a comeback and his soldier's distaste for adding to dissension". Kahin said that [...] "despite the <b>circumspection</b> of his public addresses, [...] undoubtedly helped encourage the Struggle Movement." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite devoting whole {{books to}} ephemeral {{or in some}} cases {{non-existent}} usurpers, there are no independent biographies of the Emperors Quintillus and Florian, whose reigns are merely briefly noted {{towards the end of the}} biographies of their respective predecessors, Claudius Gothicus and Tacitus. For nearly 300 years after Casaubon's edition, though much of the Augustan History was treated with some scepticism, it was used by historians as an authentic source – Edward Gibbon used it extensively in the first volume of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. However, [...] "in modern times most scholars read the work as a piece of deliberate mystification written much later than its purported date, however the fundamentalist view still has distinguished support. (...) [...] The Historia Augusta is also, unfortunately, the principal Latin source for a century of Roman history. [...] The historian must make use of it, but only with extreme <b>circumspection</b> and caution." ...|$|E
500|$|The legal {{implications}} of GCHQ were that many areas once considered unreviewable were now potentially open to judicial scrutiny by the United Kingdom courts, {{except for a}} list of prerogatives that Lord Roskill provided as being non-reviewable [...] "because their nature and subject matter are such as not to be amenable to the judicial process". These included prerogative powers of treaty-making, the defence of the realm, the prerogative of mercy, the granting of honours, the dissolution of parliament, and the appointment of ministers. Subsequent case law shows that this list has largely been accepted, and there is indication that the judges have continued to move with a degree of <b>circumspection,</b> and sometimes even in reaction against such developments. However, in Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament v. Prime Minister (2002), Justice Maurice Kay accepted that the ambit of the [...] "forbidden areas" [...] identified by Lord Roskill is not immutable, and had been reduced in some cases.|$|E
500|$|Outside {{the brief}} notices of Philip's {{exploits}} which occur in Diodorus and Justin, further {{details of his}} campaigns (and indeed the period in general) {{can be found in}} the orations of Athenian statesmen, primarily Demosthenes and Aeschines, which have survived intact. Since these speeches were never intended to be historical material, they must be treated with great <b>circumspection,</b> particularly given the identity of the authors. Demosthenes and Aeschines have been described as [...] "a couple of liars, neither of whom can be trusted to have told the truth in any matter in which it was remotely in his interest to lie". For instance, the Peace of Philocrates (made in 346 BC) is known primarily from their speeches (both called On the False Embassy), made in 343 BC, when Demosthenes prosecuted Aeschines for his involvement in making the peace treaty. In his speech, Aeschines poses as the champion of the peace treaty, when he had in fact opposed making peace; conversely, Demosthenes, who had been a proponent of peace in 346 BC represents himself as part of the [...] "war-party". The arguments made in the speeches therefore refer to the political situation in 343 BC and not the situation when the treaty was made, which makes teasing out the actual historical threads rather difficult.|$|E

On 20 July 1649 he was consequently removed from his post as attorney general, as was Fell, who was moved to join him at the Chester circuit, taking the post of Puisne Justice of Chester: fittingly they were called to the bench of their Inn together in the following year.|$|E
2500|$|Most of Islamic {{history was}} {{transmitted}} orally {{until after the}} rise of the Abbasid Caliphate. Historical works of later Muslim writers include the traditional Muslim biographies of Muhammad and quotes attributed to him (the sira and hadith literature), which provide further information on Muhammad's life. The earliest surviving written sira (biographies and quotes attributed to Muhammad) is Sirah Rasul Allah(Life of God's Messenger) by Ibn Ishaq (d. 761 or 767 AD). Although the original work is lost, portions survive in the recensions of Ibn Hisham (d. 833) and Al-Tabari (d. 923). Many (but not all) scholars accept the accuracy of these biographies, although this accuracy is uncertain. Studies by J. Schacht and Ignác Goldziher have led scholars to distinguish between legal and historical traditions. According to William Montgomery Watt, although legal traditions could have been invented, historical material may have been primarily subject to [...] "tendential shaping" [...] rather than invented. Modern Western scholars are much less likely than Sunni Islamic scholars to trust the work of the Abbasid historians, and Western historians approach the classic Islamic histories with varying degrees of <b>circumspection.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The boat's repairs {{took longer}} than {{expected}} {{and instead of}} being completed by 4 April, {{it was not until}} the 10th that the boat was ready to depart on its third patrol. Nevertheless, when she left, she did so with repairs incomplete and a number of dock workers remained on board to finish these off while at sea. Departing Lorient with an armed escort known as a Sperrbrecher and three anti-submarine vessels, U-175 proceeded independently after passing Ile de Groix. In the days that followed, a number of radar contacts sent the boat below the surface. However, by 15 April they had arrived in the Mid-Atlantic air gap where they were out of range of Allied aircraft, allowing them to operate on the surface with less <b>circumspection.</b> The following day, BdU ordered U-175 to join an attack on convoy HX-233, a Liverpool-bound convoy which had departed Halifax and New York City earlier in the month, which had been spotted by [...] while on a clandestine operation to pick up German prisoners-of-war.
