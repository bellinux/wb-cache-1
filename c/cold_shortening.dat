50|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>shortening</b> {{is caused}} by the release of stored calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic {{reticulum}} of muscle fibers, in response to the cold stimulus. The calcium ions trigger powerful muscle contraction aided by ATP molecules. To prevent <b>cold</b> <b>shortening,</b> a process known as electrical stimulation is carried out, especially in beef carcasses, immediately after slaughter and skinning. In this process, the carcass is stimulated with alternating current, causing it to contract and relax, which depletes the ATP reserve from the carcass and prevents <b>cold</b> <b>shortening.</b>|$|E

50|$|It is {{necessary}} to note the difference between articulation disorders and dialectical variations.

Examples of dialectical features that may be mistaken for articulation disorders include the r-lessness of New York City speech in words like floor, here, and paper as well as the reduction of consonant clusters in African-American Vernacular English (AAVE). If a word ends with two or more consonants such as in cold, and is followed by another word that begins with a consonant such as cuts, <b>cold</b> is <b>shortened</b> to col, producing col cuts.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine if excised, cold-shortened muscle improves in tenderness with refrigerated aging.

Beef ribeye and shoulder clod muscles from the left side of 12 carcasses were removed 45 min postmortem and placed in an ice bath to induce <b>cold</b> <b>shortening.</b> Corresponding muscles from the right side were chilled conventionally on the intact side. One-inch steaks from these muscles were either frozen at 24 hours or aged for 14 days at 40 ºF before being cooked and analyzed. Steaks were analyzed raw, or cooked to 160 ºF internally in a oven at 200 (SLOW) or 500 °F (FAST). Sarcomere length (degree of contraction), tenderness, and the extent of degradation of structural proteins were measured. Rapid chilling caused severe muscle contraction, which had a dramatic toughening effect. At 24 hours, the cold-shortened muscle showed less protein degradation than conventionally chilled muscle. After aging 14 days, tenderness had improved and protein degradation had occurred in both cold-shortened and conventional muscles, but degradation was still less in cold-shortened muscles. The improvement in tenderness and the increase in protein degradation from 1 to 14 days were equal between cold-shortened and conventional chilling treatments but the cold-shortened muscles remained tougher. FAST cooking resulted in greater cooking losses and greater sarcomere shortening than SLOW cooking. Cooking rate did not affect the tenderness of ribeye steaks, but SLOW cooking improved the tenderness of shoulder clod steaks that are higher in connective tissue. Extreme chilling conditions, which induce <b>cold</b> <b>shortening,</b> may reduce protein degradation beyond the effect of shortening.

40|$|This paper {{reviewed}} the {{mechanisms by which}} glycolytic rate and pre-rigor stretching of muscle impact on meat quality. If muscle is free to shorten during the rigor process extremes in glycolytic rate can impact negatively on meat quality by inducing either <b>cold</b> or rigor <b>shortening.</b> Factors that contribute to variation in glycolytic rate include the glycogen concentration at slaughter and fibre type of the muscle. Glycolysis is highly sensitive to temperature, which {{is an important factor}} in heavy grain fed carcasses. An alternative solution to controlling glycolysis is to stretch the muscle pre-rigor so that it cannot shorten, thus providing an insurance against extremes in processing conditions. Results are presented which show a large reduction in variance (both additive and phenotypic) in tenderness caused by pre-rigor stretching. Whilst this did not impact on the heritability of shear force, it did reduce genotype differences. The implications of these results on the magnitude of genotype effects on tenderness is discussed...|$|R

30|$|The {{increased}} {{retention of}} vitamin C in leukocytes {{is conducive to}} providing maximum cellular concentrations of vitamin C for optimum biochemical activity, including immune function. In a study with two groups of non-ascorbate synthesizing rats, EC fed animals showed higher vitamin C activity and body weight gain compared to the group fed AA (Verlangieri et al. 1991). In humans, the fundamental processes of leukocytes, especially neutrophil phagocytic capacity, can be depressed when leukocytes are low in vitamin C, however, repletion with vitamin C can help restore these important functions (Jayachandran et al. 2000). Diminished neutrophil function in subjects with furunculosis was improved following supplementation with 1000  mg vitamin C for 4 – 6  weeks, including increased neutrophil chemotaxis and phagocytosis (Levy et al. 1996). Enhancement of neutrophil motility, chemotaxis and phagocytosis has been observed after the ingestion of 250 – 3000  mg vitamin C in both healthy and diseased adults (Levy et al. 1996; Anderson et al. 1980).

Chicks adapted well to the temperatures through a high flexibility in behavior and physiological development. In response to <b>cold,</b> chicks <b>shortened</b> foraging bout lengths two- to sixfold, and increased cycle lengths (i. e. length of a brooding bout plus subsequent foraging bout), resulting in a decrease in total foraging time. Body temperature during foraging was lower in cold-exposed chicks but did not drop below 37. 8 °C, suggesting that the direct cause to end a foraging bout was not body temperature. The metabolic rate of cold-exposed chicks was reduced by 48 % to 60 % when switching from foraging to brooding, which {{may be an important}} factor in determining foraging behavior of precocial chicks. Mass-specific food intake of the cold-exposed chicks exceeded that of warm chicks by 15 %. Cold-exposed chicks doubled foraging efficiency to reach this intake during their reduced foraging time. Metabolic rates initially were similar in both groups, but increased rapidly and were elevated in cold-exposed chicks from 15 days of age onward. Growth rate initially was reduced in cold-exposed chicks, and exceeded growth of warm chicks only after 21 days of age.

Electrical stimulation as a process involves passing an electric current through the carcass of freshly slaughtered animals.

Many studies conducted in the USA, in New Zealand, Australia and Europe have involved a variety of electrical stimulation methods on different types of meat animals. Data reported in many studies suggest that electrical stimulation, through hastening rigor changes, can significantly reduce in the carcasses of meat animals the phenomenon of <b>cold</b> <b>shortening,</b> one of the major cause of meat toughness. Although it is well established that electrical stimulation increases the rate of post mortem glycolysis, other biochemical and biophysical effects have been implicated with the use of this technology, including the possibility that electrical stimulation also results in physical disruption of muscle structure.

SETTING: Placebo-controlled zinc lozenge trials, in which the zinc dose was[*]>[*] 75 [*]mg/day. The pooled effect of zinc lozenges on common cold duration was calculated by using inverse-variance random-effects method. PARTICIPANTS: Seven randomised trials with 575 participants with naturally acquired common colds. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Duration of the common cold. RESULTS: The mean common cold duration was 33 % (95 % CI 21 % to 45 %) shorter for the zinc groups of the seven included trials. Three trials that used lozenges composed of zinc acetate found that <b>colds</b> were <b>shortened</b> by 40 % and four trials that used zinc gluconate by 28 %. The {{difference between the two}} salts was not significant: 12 percentage points (95 % CI: - 12 to[*]+[*] 36).

The six different durations of cold period, used in this study, caused six different terms of hatching from 16 March to 29 June. When compared to the group held under ambient Irish conditions with fluctuating water temperatures during the incubation period (E = 29. 9 ± 4. 5 %), higher incubation efficiency was found in all groups under the controlled conditions (E = 73. 1 ± 4. 7 % − 41. 3 ± 2. 7 %). In groups under controlled conditions, a positive effect of <b>shortened</b> <b>cold</b> period on incubation efficiency was found, with the highest efficiency (E = 73. 1 ± 4. 7 % − 68. 8 ± 5. 2 %) found after the shortest cold period, while the longest cold period led to the lowest efficiency (E = 41. 3 ± 2. 7 %) ...|$|R
