50|$|Between 2000 and 2007 Biľak was the co-founder (along with Stuart Bailey), co-editor, and {{designer}} of Dot Dot Dot, an {{art and design}} journal. Dot dot dot is a biannual, self- published, after-hours magazine, originally centred around graphic design, later broadening in scope to interdisciplinary journalism on subjects that affect the way {{we look at the}} world, how we think about and make design. It was not to be a magazine showing visual outcomes of the design process, but presenting the recurring themes of daily work. It was designed to <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> thinking from ‘what a design magazine should show’ to ‘what we are interested in as designers’. After three issues, the tagline ‘graphic design/visual communication magazine’, was scrapped, since Bil’ak thought there was no reason why some things like film, music, literature should not be in the magazine. The only connection it has with graphic design is that the co-founders studied design. The last issue of Dot Dot Dot magazine was published in summer 2010.|$|E
50|$|In 1998 {{the group}} of 40 {{performers}} migrated to the Bronx in New York. Finding a manager for the company that would do all the logistical work for the company, that could keep everybody together as a larger group was next to impossible.

That change fragmented the company into many smaller groups of people which meant changing {{the structure of the}} members' training. That was an easy adjustment to make because everyone had been training for years in West African dancing, performing and acting. Even so, the fragmentation of the groups made it hard for everybody to focus on the company. Over a short amount of time, 90% of the group decided to get jobs. Some began working in stores or restaurants, some started braiding hair for the ladies, and some decided teach dance and drumming. Because African dance is not valued the same as other western forms of art, finding work as an African Dance troupe was not easy.|$|E
