5|$|Early {{approaches}} to preserving food used variants of traditional cold boxes {{to solve the}} problem of how to take small quantities of products short distances to market. Thomas Moore, an engineer from Maryland, invented an early refrigerator which he patented in 1803; this involved a large, insulated wooden box, with a tin container of ice embedded in the top. This refrigerator primarily relied upon simple insulation, rather than ventilation, but the design was widely adopted by farmers and small traders, and illegal copies abounded. By the 1830s portable refrigerator chests became used in the meat trade, taking advantage of the growing supplies of ice to use ventilation to better preserve the food. By the 1840s, improved supplies and an understanding of the importance of <b>circulating</b> <b>air</b> was making a significant improvement to refrigeration in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Neck rot is a {{fungal disease}} {{affecting}} onions in storage. It {{is caused by}} Botrytis allii, which attacks the neck and upper parts of the bulb, causing a grey mould to develop. The symptoms often first occur where the bulb has been damaged and spread downwards in the affected scales. Large quantities of spores are produced and crust-like sclerotia may also develop. In time, a dry rot sets in and the bulb becomes a dry, mummified structure. This disease may be present throughout the growing period, but only manifests itself when the bulb is in storage. Antifungal seed dressings are available and the disease can be minimised by preventing physical damage to the bulbs at harvesting, careful drying and curing of the mature onions, and correct storage in a cool, dry place with plenty of <b>circulating</b> <b>air.</b>|$|E
25|$|UV-C {{light is}} weak at the Earth's surface as {{the ozone layer}} of the {{atmosphere}} blocks it. UVGI devices can produce strong enough UV-C light in <b>circulating</b> <b>air</b> or water systems to make them inhospitable environments to microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, molds and other pathogens. UVGI can be coupled with a filtration system to sanitize air and water.|$|E

25|$|Comfort {{is reached}} at lower air {{temperature}} due to eliminating <b>circulating</b> <b>air.</b> Radiant heating experiences highest comfort levels as people's own energy (Â± 70 Watt for an adult) (must radiate out in heating season) is in balance with its surrounds. Compared to convection heating {{system based on}} academic research the air temperatures may be lowered by up to 3 degrees.|$|E
25|$|Satisfactory kiln {{drying can}} usually be {{accomplished}} by regulating the temperature and humidity of the <b>circulating</b> <b>air</b> to control the moisture content of the lumber at any given time. This condition is achieved by applying kiln-drying schedules. The desired objective of an appropriate schedule is to ensure drying lumber at the fastest possible rate without causing objectionable degrade. The following factors have a considerable bearing on the schedules.|$|E
25|$|An {{electric}} {{underfloor heating}} system has heating cables {{embedded in the}} floor. Current flows through a conductive heating material, supplied either directly from the line voltage (120 or 240 volts) or at low voltage from a transformer. The heated cables warm the flooring by direct conduction and will switch off once it reaches the temperature set by the floor thermostat. A warmer floor surface radiates heat to colder surrounding surfaces (ceiling, walls, furniture.) which absorb heat and reflects all non absorbed heat to yet other still cooler surfaces. The cycle of radiation, absorption and reflection starts slowly and slows down slowly nearing set point temperatures and ceases to take place once equilibrium is reached all-round. A floor thermostat or a room thermostat or combination controls the floor on/off. In the process of radiant heating {{a thin layer of}} air which is in touch with the warmed surfaces also absorbs some heat and this creates a little convection (air circulation). Contrary to believe people are not heated by this warmed <b>circulating</b> <b>air</b> or convection (convection has a cooling effect) but are heated by the direct radiation of the source and reflection of its surrounds.|$|E
50|$|A {{convection}} oven (also {{known as a}} fan-assisted oven or simply a fan oven) is an oven that has fans to <b>circulate</b> <b>air</b> around food. In the Philippines, this type of oven {{is often referred to}} as a turbo broiler.|$|R
50|$|Symptoms of rust {{disease are}} {{correlated}} to relatively high moisture. The avoidance of overhead watering at night, using drip irrigation, reducing crop density, and using fans to <b>circulate</b> <b>air</b> flow will lower the relative moisture and decrease {{the severity of}} rust infection.|$|R
50|$|The use of {{flexible}} thin-film photovoltaic modules provides fluid integration with steel roofing profiles, enhancing the building's design. Orienting a {{building to the}} sun, selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties, and designing spaces that naturally <b>circulate</b> <b>air</b> also constitute solar architecture.|$|R

[...] If the chamber is large or the fuming is to be done for a long time then more than one container may be provided or the ammonia may be replenished during the process. [...] The fuming time depends on the amount of darkening required, the size of the chamber, and the strength of the ammonia used. [...] It is usual to oil the wood after fuming to fully bring out the effect.|$|E

2500|$|An HVLS fan ("HVLS" [...] {{stands for}} [...] "High-Volume-Low-Speed") {{is a type}} of {{rotational}} mechanical fan that moves large amounts of <b>circulating</b> <b>air.</b> In addition, HVLS fans {{have been found to be}} more beneficial than traditional HVAC fans as they are more cost effective as well as having a stronger cooling effect while helping to maintain a constant temperature and humidity. Using 10 overhead airfoil blades in a barn, the HVLS fan was invented in 1998 by Walter Boyd who was challenged to find a better means to reduce the heat stress of dairy cattle which in turn, would increase milk production.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to select the most {{suitable}} freezing and thawing method for preserving the quality of pasta flata type Parenica cheese comparing different methods: slow, shock (<b>circulated</b> <b>air)</b> and cryogenic freezing and thawing at room temperature and in a refrigerator, respectively. To observe the effects of these methods on some cheese properties weight, pH, and dry-matter content were measured, stringiness was examined, and compression test were performed for texture analysis. Thermophysical properties were determined by DSC: unfreezable water content, onset point of melting, and latent heat. Sensory analyses were also carried out by profle analysis. Results of objective and subjective measurements showed similar trends: characteristics of cheese samples frozen in <b>circulated</b> <b>air</b> and thawed in refrigerator resembled the most to the control sample...|$|R

50|$|The {{origin of}} frostwork is {{somewhat}} controversial. Formation of cave frostwork has {{been attributed to}} moist, <b>circulating</b> <b>air</b> which, containing dissolved calcium carbonate, drifted against rock surfaces and coated them with the delicate crystals. Frostwork has also been attributed to water seepage from cave passageways in which there are relatively high evaporation rates.|$|E
5000|$|Air {{regeneration}} in {{the interior}} of the submarine was accomplished by an auxiliary [...] engine, which passed the air through a sodium hydroxide purifier to eliminate CO2 exhaled by the crew.

50|$|Ventilation is {{not just}} {{important}} for <b>circulating</b> <b>air,</b> but also for preventing the growth of mold and development and spread of harmful bacteria. This is especially important in warm, humid vivariums. The traditional method consists of placing a suction fan (or ventilation slits) at a low level and another exhaust fan at a higher level, which allows the continual circulation of fresh air.|$|E
