5|$|In August 1990 the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) {{despatched}} {{a peacekeeping}} force, ECOMOG, to Liberia. The force {{arrived at the}} Freeport of Monrovia on August 24, 1990, landing from Nigerian and Ghanaian vessels. By the time ECOMOG arrived, Prince Johnson's INPFL and Taylor's NPFL were fighting on the outside bounds of the port. A series of peacemaking conferences in regional capitals followed. There were meetings in Bamako in November 1990, Lome in January 1991, and Yamoussoukro in June–October 1991. The first seven peace conferences, including the Yamoussoukro I-IV processes and the Carter Center negotiation leading to the <b>Cotonou</b> Accords, failed {{due to lack of}} agreement between the warring factions. The NPFL launched an assault on Monrovia in 1992, which they named 'Operation Octopus.' The civil war lasted until the Abuja Accords of August 1996.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, ECOWAS {{brokered}} a {{peace agreement}} in <b>Cotonou,</b> Benin. Following this, on September 22, 1993, the United Nations (U.N.) Security Council established the UN Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL), to support ECOMOG in implementing this <b>Cotonou</b> peace agreement. UNOMIL in early 1994 deployed 368 military observers and associated civilian personnel to monitor implementation of the abortive <b>Cotonou</b> Peace Agreement, prior to elections originally planned for February/March 1994.|$|E
25|$|Operation Benin, {{also known}} as Operation <b>Cotonou,</b> was a rescue mission {{carried out by the}} Lebanese Navy SEALs Regiment in <b>Cotonou,</b> Benin between December 26, 2003 and December 30, 2003 This {{operation}} is considered to be the first mission carried out by Lebanese Armed Forces units abroad. Its task was to recover bodies and two black boxes from UTA Flight 141.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, the EU {{changed its}} {{reading of the}} <b>Cotonou</b> Agreement (the Association Agreement between the EU and the ACP countries). It now stated that the <b>Cotonou</b> {{agreement}} should not be interpreted as mandating free movement of labour, but rather the free trade of goods and services. The Home Office were subsequently able to introduce new rules placing restrictions on Kolpak players, stating that only those who had held a valid work permit for four years {{had the right to}} be treated the same as EU citizens.|$|E
25|$|Maga {{established}} the National Party for Democracy and Development in 1989 {{and participated in}} the National Conference of 1990, which gave amnesty to all Beninese political refugees. He also {{was a member of}} the High Council of the Republic before retiring from political life. He did make some public appearances, such as at independence day celebrations in 1998. At the time of his death, he sat upon the Constitutional Court of Dahomey. On May 8, 2000, Maga died of a heart attack in <b>Cotonou.</b> A hospital in <b>Cotonou</b> now bears his name.|$|E
25|$|Moumouni {{was born}} in <b>Cotonou</b> on October 25, 1922. Moumounti {{graduated}} from the Victor Segalen Bordeaux 2 University of the University of Bordeaux in France with a Doctorate of Medicine, and later qualified as a Master of Public Health and Science, obtained respectively in Montreal, Quebec, Canada and Chicago, United States. After his university studies, Moumoni returned to <b>Cotonou,</b> where he practised as a physician until 1959, and would later spend much {{of his adult life}} outside Dahomey's borders. When independence was obtained, Moumouni was appointed Director of the Ministry of Health for his country. From 1963 to 1968, he worked for the World Health Organization in Brazzaville, Congo.|$|E

On 26 January, Nigeria beat Morocco and Egypt beat Benin in the semi finals. The finals took place on 29 January. It was marked by the victory of Nigeria over Egypt; Benin won the 3rd place, beating Morocco. The next junior African Cup of Nations {{will take place in}} the Republic of the Congo.|$|E
25|$|Factional leaders {{agreed in}} September 1994 to the Akosombo Agreement, a {{supplement}} to the <b>Cotonou</b> agreement, named after the Ghanaian town where it was signed. The security situation in Liberia remained poor. In October 1994, {{in the face of}} ECOMOG funding shortfalls and a lack of will by the Liberian combatants to honor agreements to end the war, the UN Security Council reduced to about 90 the number of UNOMIL observers. It extended UNOMIL’s mandate and subsequently extended it several times until September 1997.|$|E
25|$|After {{leaving office}} in 2006, Kérékou {{stayed out of}} {{politics}} and spent time at his homes in <b>Cotonou</b> and Natitingou in northwestern Benin, his native region. He suffered a health crisis in 2014 and was taken to Paris for treatment. Although he recovered, he continued to suffer health problems, and he died in Benin on 14 October 2015 {{at the age of}} 82. His death was announced in a statement by President Thomas Boni Yayi. No cause of death was stated. A week of national mourning was declared.|$|E
25|$|In {{light of}} these events, Maga {{canceled}} his trip to the United States and returned to Dahomey immediately. Appealing for peace, he convened a special National Assembly session. The protesters and trade unionists were indifferent to his efforts toward reconciliation. When Maga agreed with their demands and replaced his government with a provisional one in which Apithy and Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin had equal standing, they organized themselves to protest this new order. Armed northerners came down to <b>Cotonou</b> to support Maga and clashed with dissenters, killing two. The protesters, however, would not return to their jobs until Maga no longer held his.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} October, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin {{convinced}} the trade unions that he controlled to begin another strike in protest against Maga's inability to promote national development, and to ensure {{the welfare of the}} working class. The strike lasted for two days in the cities of Porto Novo and <b>Cotonou,</b> and became so serious that the police used tear gas. It ended when Maga sent down faithful Northerners armed with bows and arrows to patrol the streets at night. On November 2, members of the U.D.D. organized a motion of censure in the National Assembly. Maga relied on Apithy's assistance in opposing the motion, and it was ultimately defeated.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} September Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin {{convinced}} the trade unions that he owned to begin another strike for Maga's inability to promote national development and ensure {{the welfare of the}} working class. The strike, which existed in Dahomey's capital of Porto Novo and its largest city of <b>Cotonou,</b> became so serious that police forces used tear gas and ended when Maga sent down some faithful Northerners, carrying around bows and arrows and patrolling the streets at night. At the same time members of the UDD organised a motion of censure in the National Assembly. Maga relied on Apithy for help in opposing the motion, and it was ultimately rejected.|$|E
25|$|The Council lost {{popularity}} with the Kutuklui Affair. By decree of Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin {{and the rest}} of the council, Togolese opposition leader Noe Kutuklui was officially expelled from Dahomey on October 27, 1971, where he had been practicing law since the late 1960s. It was at the request of General Etienne Eyadema, president of Togo, as Kutuklui had been involved in several plots against Eyadema's military government. The Council's decision to extradite him spurred demonstrations in <b>Cotonou.</b> Maga was unable to carry out his decision; Alphonse Alley protected Kutuklui and took him to an unknown place outside of Dahomey. Col. Alley received no punishment whatsoever for his role in the Affair.|$|E
25|$|In July 2013 Tuvalu {{signed the}} Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to {{establish}} the Pacific Regional Trade and Development Facility, which Facility originated in 2006, {{in the context of}} negotiations for an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) between Pacific ACP States and the European Union. The rationale for the creation of the Facility being to improve the delivery of aid to Pacific island countries in support of the Aid-for-Trade (AfT) requirements. The Pacific ACP States are the countries in the Pacific that are signatories to the <b>Cotonou</b> Agreement with the European Union. On 18 February 2016 Tuvalu signed the Pacific Islands Development Forum Charter and formally joined the Pacific Islands Development Forum (PIDF). In June 2017, Tuvalu sign the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations (PACER).|$|E
25|$|Maga's {{original}} cabinet resigned on December 29. He {{named the}} new ministers in his government the next day, and chose many {{leaders from the}} former R.D.D. and P.N.D. He appointed Arouna Mama as the Minister of the Interior; Assogba Oké to the post of Foreign Affairs; Paul Darboux to Trade and Economics; Sébastien Dassi to Agriculture; Victorien Gbaguidi to Transport and Public Works; Joseph Kekeh to Justice; René Deroux to Health and Social Affairs; Michel Ahouanmenou to Education; and Alexandre Adandé as Finance Minister. Newcomers were Bertin Borna, Labor and Civil Service; and Albert Teveodjré, the new Information Minister. To prevent a backlash from the opposition, Maga and his ministers moved their offices from Porto Novo to <b>Cotonou,</b> where the U.D.D had received 90percent {{of the vote in}} the recent election.|$|E
25|$|The May 1951 {{law also}} {{enlarged}} the electorate from 61,958 to 333,693. Some dead people were even counted as electors {{due to the}} mishandling of election cards. The <b>Cotonou</b> newspaper L'Etoile du Dahomey noted a man who gave an unlimited number of cards {{as long as they}} promised to vote for Maga's main opponent, accountant and deputy Sourou-Migan Apithy. Altogether, however, only 44% of the population voted on election day. Apithy was reelected a deputy with 53,463 votes out of 147,350 cast, while Maga captured the second seat with 49,329 and third candidate Emile Derlin Zinsou received a mere 18,410 ballots. Several smaller parties hosted several other candidates, which received the rest of the votes. Only 0.5 percent of Maga's votes came from the coastal region, while 98 percent came from northern towns and villages. The 1951 election has been cited as when regionalist parties arose, {{and it was the first}} whose pamphlets mentioned ethnicity.|$|E
500|$|The {{introduction}} of International Monetary Fund policies, along with corruption, mismanagement and overstaffing, {{led to a}} steady decline of Nigeria Airways from the 1980s. The carrier had accumulated significant debts that outstripped its revenues from the mid-1980s, {{to the extent that}} aircraft were detained or impounded for unpaid debts. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) suspended Nigeria Airways in early 1987 from the clearing house (which meant the airline could not issue tickets to fly on other IATA member airlines and the converse) for accumulated debts of [...] In late 1987 the airline had debts for approximately , with a revenue of [...] per month and expenditure of approximately [...] a month. This situation prompted the airline to increase its domestic and international fares by 100% and 20%, respectively, in order to raise funds to alleviate the deficit, but this measure reduced the passenger traffic. Even though 1,000 jobs had been cut by late 1986 and 1,700 {{in the course of the}} previous year, Nigeria ordered the airline to further downsize (the number of employees was 8,500 at the time—or 500 for each aircraft in the fleet, twice the international average—) and to reduce or discontinue unprofitable routes. In 1988, cost-cutting measures led to the discontinuance of flights to a number of African destinations, including <b>Cotonou,</b> Dakar, Douala, Kinshasa, Monrovia and Nairobi, and to the transfer of some routes to the privately-owned airline Okada Air; some of these routes were resumed a year later. In December 1988 the airline dismissed 3,000 employees, a third of the workforce, in an effort to keep operations afloat. In the late 1980s the airline lost a deposit worth [...] for not firming up an order for six ATR-42s. Financed by a Japanese leasing company, the carrier phased in the last DC-10 ever built; the aircraft was delivered in 1989, and replaced an aircraft of the same type that was lost in an accident two years earlier.|$|E

2500|$|After being {{released}} from incarceration, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin was elected a Member of Parliament in 1991 under the National Rally for Democracy ticket and served at until 1995. He continued to lead the U.D.D. until his death on March 8, 2002 at the Hubert Maga National University and Hospital Center in <b>Cotonou.</b> No {{cause of death was}} given, although he was said to have suffered for a long time. The last of the triumvirate to die, he was awarded a state funeral and seven days of mourning, beginning on March 11. Flags were ordered to be flown at half-staff throughout the country during that period. President Kerekou visited Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin's house shortly after his death, praising him as [...] "a man of character, conviction, a fighter and a wise man." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, the European Parliament {{adopted the}} [...] "Resolution on Fair Trade" [...] (OJ C 226/73, 20 July 1998), which was {{followed}} by the Commission in 1999 that adopted the [...] "Communication from the Commission to the Council on 'Fair Trade'" [...] COM(1999) 619 final, 29 November 1999. In 2000, public institutions in Europe started purchasing Fairtrade Certified coffee and tea. Furthermore, that year, the <b>Cotonou</b> Agreement made specific reference to the promotion of Fair Trade in article 23(g) and in the Compendium. The European Parliament and Council Directive 2000/36/EC also suggested promoting Fair Trade. In 2001 and 2002, several other EU papers explicitly mentioned fair trade, most notably the 2001 Green Paper on Corporate Social Responsibility and the 2002 Communication on Trade and Development.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1990 National Conference, {{which was}} nationally televised, Kérékou {{spoke to the}} Archbishop of <b>Cotonou,</b> Isidore de Souza, confessing guilt and begging {{forgiveness}} for the flaws of his regime. An observer {{described it as a}} [...] "remarkable piece of political theater", full of cultural symbolism and significance; in effect, Kérékou was seeking forgiveness from his people. Such a gesture, so unusual for the African autocrats of the time, could have fatally weakened Kérékou's political standing, but he performed the gesture in such a way that, far from ending his political career, it instead served to symbolically redeem him and facilitate his political rehabilitation, while also [...] "securing him immunity from prosecution". Kérékou shrewdly utilized the timing and setting: [...] "Culturally as well as theologically it was impossible to refuse forgiveness on these terms." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{people of}} Dahomey were outraged at Bokhiri's release. Racial clashes {{broke out in}} the summer of 1963, as the murderer and the victim were of {{different}} tribes. Demonstrations were organized in Porto Novo on October 21 and soon spread to <b>Cotonou.</b> They remained somewhat orderly before the trade unionists were involved. While still led by Maga, the trade unionists were still upset by the wage cut and used the case to further their interests. In addition, they criticized what they called Maga's [...] "squander-mania", such as the construction of a presidential palace. Most of the demonstrations were peaceful, although several demonstrators destroyed a hospital sign containing Maga's name. Six trade unionists were arrested {{on the second day of}} demonstrations, causing the unions to call a general strike. By the end of the second day, protesters forced the National Assembly to put Bokhiri back in jail, and the Assembly simultaneously enforced a curfew.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the turn}} of the {{millennium}} Sony has released [...] more Kalahari Surfers albums. Akasic Record (2001) is [...] "a highly sophisticated foray into African-flavoured dubfunk"; Muti Media (2003) features a sculpture by Brett Murray on the cover, and Zukile Malahlana from Marekta appears on the album. Conspiracy of Silence (2005) and Panga Management (2007) followed. One Party State (2010) was released on Microdot and debuted at the African Soul Rebels Tour in the UK alongside Oumou Sangaré & Orchestre Poly-Rythmo De <b>Cotonou.</b> It features Sowetan poet Lesego Rampolokeng on four tracks. The Mail & Guardian called it [...] "a politically drenched album... track for track the most solid South African release of 2010". The Kalahari Surfers performed at the Cape Town Electronic Music Festival in early 2012, and released a live album of the performance. Agitprop was released later in 2012, on Sjambok Music; it was first played at the Unyazi Festival in Durban in September. Agitprop explores Sony's fears about South Africa in the 2010s becoming a one party state under the African National Congress, and includes a song about chemical warfare scientist Wouter Basson. South African Rolling Stone compared it to the KLF, Sly and Robbie and Pink Floyd, and described its [...] "slow evolution of nuance" [...] towards the [...] "desolately upbeat" [...] "Hostile Takeover". Sony says the album was mostly written on the train while commuting to work; he calls the genre [...] "Voktronic, ... a blend of folktronic, and volkspiele with a dose of electronic experimental dubstoep and experimental rolled up into one fat two blade stereo hit." ...|$|E
