40|$|The {{application}} of olefin-selective membrane materials in gas-liquid membrane <b>contactors</b> <b>for</b> {{the separation of}} paraffins and olefins using a silver nitrate solution as the absorption liquid {{turned out to be}} very successful, especially with respect to the olefin/paraffin selectivity obtainable. Composite hollow-fiber membranes with a top layer of a highly permeable block copolymer of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) are prepared and applied in a gas-liquid membrane <b>contactor</b> <b>for</b> the separation of paraffins and olefins using a silver nitrate solution as the absorption liquid. The water present in the absorption liquid swells the hydrophilic polymer sufficiently. This prevents drying out of the layer and enables the partitioning of silver ions into the polymer matrix, making it olefin-selective. Ethylene permeabilities obtained are comparable to the values found for membranes with nonselective, elastomeric top layers (40 - 50 barrer). Selectivities, however, are more than 20 times higher. Independent of the liquid flow rate, a selectivity of 165 is obtained for PEO/PBT-coated membranes.

40|$|International audienceMembrane {{contactors}} {{have received}} increased attention since the 1980 s and are already used for different industrial applications. A {{very large number}} of studies have been reported, more specifically to achieve intensified gas-liquid mass transfer, almost exclusively in water or aqueous solutions. In contrast, the potentialities of membrane <b>contactors</b> <b>for</b> gas-liquid processes based on non-aqueous physical solvents are essentially unexplored. This study intends to discuss the difficulties associated with the specific physical solvent context and explore the potentialities of membrane <b>contactors</b> <b>for</b> both absorption and regeneration steps. Theoretical arguments show that dense membranes based on superpermeable and mechanically resistant polymers could offer promising performances, owing to their capacity to simultaneously prevent wetting effects, sustain a high transmembrane pressure and offer process intensification possibilities. Moreover, a significant improvement in terms of energy efficiency is theoretically achievable for the regeneration step. A preliminary proof of concept study, which supports these potentialities, is presented and the research needs for this new approach in order to possibly achieve applications at industrial scale are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Microporous {{hollow fiber}} gas-liquid {{membrane}} contactors have a fixed and well-defined gas-liquid interfacial area. The liquid {{flow through the}} hollow fiber is laminar, thus the liquid side hydrodynamics are well known. This allows the accurate calculation of the fiber side physical mass transfer coefficient from first principles. Moreover, {{in the case of}} gas-liquid membrane contactor, the gas-liquid exposure time can be varied easily and independently without disturbing the gas-liquid interfacial area. These features of the hollow fiber membrane contactor make it very suitable as a gas-liquid model contactor and offer numerous advantages over the conventional model contactors. The applicability and the limitations of this novel model <b>contactor</b> <b>for</b> the determination of physico-chemical properties of non-reactive and reactive gas-liquid systems are investigated in the present work. Absorption of CO 2 into water and into aqueous NaOH solutions are chosen as model systems to determine the physico-chemical properties for non-reactive and reactive conditions, respectively. The experimental findings for these systems show that a hollow fiber membrane contactor can be used successfully as a model <b>contactor</b> <b>for</b> the determination of various gas-liquid physico-chemical properties. Moreover, since the membrane contactor facilitates indirect contact between the two phases, the application of hollow fiber model contactor can possibly be extended to liquid-liquid systems and/or heterogeneous catalyzed gas-liquid systems. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} was to determine the performance of different types of media for a post-filter second-stage <b>contactor</b> <b>for</b> the removal of manganese from a drinking water source. The Aquarion Water Company’s Lantern Hill (LH) water treatment facility in Stonington, CT served as the motivation for this study. The groundwater at this site contains significant concentrations of manganese, averaging 0. 2 mg/L, as well as iron, 2. 3 mg/L, and total organic carbon (TOC), 3. 5 mg/L. Currently, the Lantern Hill facility is using a combination of pH adjustment, potassium permanganate, chlorine, and cationic polymer addition prior to down flow through a dual media, anthracite over green sand, direct filtration process. Levels of prefilter chlorine required to maintain a filter effluent manganese concentration of 0. 02 mg/L or less result in unacceptable levels of disinfection byproducts (DBPs), specifically trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs). Prior UMass/AWC research has shown that a two-stage approach, with a first-stage dual media (DM) filter for the removal of particulate matter, including oxidized iron and some TOC, followed by a second-stage media <b>contactor</b> <b>for</b> manganese removal, is effective. Addition of chlorine after the first-stage filter results in much lower DBP levels compared to the addition of chlorine to the raw water at a level that yields effective manganese control.
