5|$|During {{his time}} as Minister of the Environment, Hareide was parodied in the {{television}} comedy program Tre brødre som ikke er brødre. The character Knut Arild Hareide, played by Harald Eia, was portrayed in several sketches as a physically weak person.

Nonetheless, Hareide himself showed a video <b>clip</b> <b>of</b> one of the parodies when publicly announcing his stepdown from national politics at the 2007 party congress.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This study {{examined}} the effectiveness of various shrub control treatments (N+P fertilization, <b>clipping</b> <b>of</b> Phlomis fruticosa and clipping combined with N+P fertilization), to reduce shrub cover and encourage the growth of palatable herbaceous vegetation. Dry matter production and Crude Protein (CP) content of palatable herbaceous vegetation were determined annually from 2004 to 2006. Experimental plots received rains of 691. 7, 532. 9 and 595. 7 mm during the 3 study years compared to mean growing season rainfall of 486. 6 mm. Forage production was increased significantly by <b>clipping</b> <b>of</b> Phlomis fruticosa (409. 4 vs 335. 5 g DM m- 2, p< 0. 05) and clipping combined with N+P fertilization (454. 6 vs 335. 5 g DM m- 2, p< 0. 05). On average over the 3 years, crude protein concentration increased by fertilization (9. 18 vs 8. 26 %, p< 0. 05) and fertilization combined with <b>clipping</b> <b>of</b> Phlomis fruticosa (9. 35 vs 8. 26 %, p< 0. 05). N and P fertilization combined with <b>clipping</b> <b>of</b> Phlomis fruticosa significantly (p< 0. 05) affected S-RUE. The highest S-RUE of 3. 09 kg forage ha- 1 mm- 1 was obtained with N+P fertilization combined with <b>clipping</b> <b>of</b> Phlomis fruticosa. On average over the 3 years, nutrient use efficiency with N+P application combined with <b>clipping</b> <b>of</b> Phlomis fruticosa for all treatments was higher than without clipping. The increases in plant production per kg fertilizer applied, for N+P application both and without <b>clipping</b> <b>of</b> Phlomi...|$|R

5|$|He {{had a role}} in the 1997 CBS {{adaptation}} of the book True Women and had a starring role in the 2000 film Lone Star Struck. In 2001, he won Best Actor at the International Teen Movie Festival (ITMF) in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada for his role in his short film Head Shot.

5|$|In 1931, {{with the}} 1932–33 series in mind, the {{selectors}} had appointed Jardine as England's captain. In {{his efforts to}} build a strategy whereby he could threaten the Australian supremacy, the new captain consulted widely. Along with other observers, including Duckworth (who had kept wicket for England during the 1930 Oval Test) he thought that Bradman showed a dislike for fast, rising balls, and had been shaken when one such delivery from Larwood had {{hit him in the}} chest. This matter had been widely discussed among cricketers; a <b>clip</b> <b>of</b> film from the Oval match appeared to confirm that Bradman had flinched. This, to Jardine, suggested the basis of a plan: a sustained attack of fast leg theory that might unsettle not just Bradman but the Australian batsmen generally.|$|E
5|$|Samantha {{revealed}} that she too {{would be seen}} in a dual role— a mature mother named Krishna Veni in the past and a bubbly girl named Priya in the present. She added that she would not be overshadowed in the film despite the presence of three male leads. Similar to Ye Maaya Chesave, Chaitanya and Samantha had a kissing scene in this film {{as a part of the}} script. A <b>clip</b> <b>of</b> one of Samantha's looks in the film was leaked in late July 2013. She was seen sporting an urban look and opted for a complete makeover. Nagarjuna's look in the film was leaked in mid August 2013 and he was seen sporting corrective eyeglasses and a conventional clean shave and moustache for which he removed the goatee he grew for his previous works Greeku Veerudu (2013) and Bhai (2013).

5|$|The Venezuelan {{government}} reacted {{negatively to}} the episode and banned Family Guy from airing on their local networks, which generally syndicate American programming. Local station Venevisión was threatened with financial sanctions for broadcasting the show, which was avoided by airing {{an episode of}} Baywatch instead and they aired public service films as an apology. Justice Minister Tareck El Aissami stated that any cable stations which refuse to stop airing the series would be fined and he also claimed that it promoted the use of cannabis. The government then displayed the <b>clip</b> <b>of</b> which featured Brian and Stewie performing the featured number and then stated that Family Guy {{is an example of}} how the United States supports cannabis use.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Corgan reading {{a comic book}} dressed in an ice cream man uniform. A <b>clip</b> <b>of</b> the intro to the song is played and stopped {{repeatedly}} before the song begins. Groups {{of two or more}} people are kissing each other around Corgan as he drives in an ice cream van through a desert. Corgan picks up a dress-wearing Iha and the two drive for a while before stopping at a gas station, where Chamberlin and Wretzky appear as gas attendants. After Iha changes into a yellow and white cowboy outfit, the band paints the van in a multitude of colors. More people are shown kissing in the hills as the band drives away from the gas station in the van. However, Corgan is ultimately kicked out of the van, and the video ends with Corgan walking off the road wearing a cowboy hat as the van drives away. The video was filmed on August 29, 1993.|$|E
5|$|Many {{important}} events occur off-camera {{and there is}} no artificial exposition in the form of voice-over or flashbacks, with the exceptions of two flashbacks – one {{at the end of the}} pilot episode that replays a moment from earlier in the same episode and one at the end of the fourth season finale that shows a short <b>clip</b> <b>of</b> a character tutoring his younger brother earlier in the season. Thus, the viewer needs to follow every conversation closely to understand the ongoing story arc and the relevance of each character to it. Salon.com has described the show as novelistic in structure, with a greater depth of writing and plotting than other crime shows. Each season of The Wire consists of between ten and thirteen episodes which form several multi-layered narratives. Simon chose this structure with an eye towards long story arcs that draw a viewer in, which then results in a more satisfying payoff. He uses the metaphor of a visual novel in several interviews, describing each episode as a chapter, and has also commented that this allows a fuller exploration of the show's themes in time not spent on plot development.|$|E
