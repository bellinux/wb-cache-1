40|$|Abstract. Rail steel at {{crossing}} areas bears much higher loads over any other {{section of a}} regular railway. Mn-containing <b>casting</b> <b>steel</b> is normally used for its high load-carrying capability and reduced wear rate. However, since Mn-containing <b>casting</b> <b>steel</b> tends to have casting defects, the cost of manufacturing defect-free Mn-containing <b>casting</b> <b>steel</b> becomes quite expensive. Therefore, {{through the use of}} welding, this study investigates the possibility of resurfacing Mn-containing rail steel using a CH- 90 electrode as an alternative to completely replacing it. In this study, a series of experimental build up weldings was made and their microstructures, chemical compositions, work-hardening index and friction coefficients were investigated. The results showed that both microstructures and chemical compositions from the build up weld section were similar to that of Mn-containing <b>casting</b> <b>steel,</b> showing an austenitic microstructure with approximately 13 % Mn. The friction coefficients measured closely to one another as well (mu of Mn-containing steel = 0. 847 and mu of the resurfaced weld metal = 0. 831). The work-hardening index of the build up weld metal was 30 % higher than that of Mn-containing <b>casting</b> <b>steel.</b> This difference could be attributed to the residual stresses in the build up weld metal which indicates that the hardening speed of the build up weld metal is faster than that of Mn-containing <b>casting</b> <b>steel</b> by impact. Therefore, build up welding, using a Mn-alloyed steel electrode on rail steel, could be a safe and economic alternative to the high cost of Mn-containing <b>casting</b> rail <b>steel</b> replacement. 1...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} the fatigue performance of low-alloy <b>cast</b> <b>steels</b> used to produce cast components, which must be heat treated {{in order to obtain}} suitable mechanical properties.

40|$|ABSTRACTIn <b>casting</b> <b>steels</b> for {{offshore}} construction, manufacturing integral casted {{structures to}} prevent fatigue {{cracks in the}} stress raisers is superior to using welded structures. Here, mold design and casting analysis were conducted for integral <b>casting</b> <b>steel.</b> The laminar flow of molten metal was analyzed and distributions of hot spots and porosities were studied. A prototype was subsequently produced, and air vents were designed to improve the surface defects caused by the release of gas. A radiographic test revealed no internal defects inside the <b>casted</b> <b>steel.</b> Evaluating the chemical and mechanical properties of specimens sampled from the product revealed that target values were quantitatively satisfied. To assess weldability in consideration of repair welding, the product was machined with grooves and welded, after which the mechanical properties of hardness as well as tensile, impact, and bending strengths were evaluated.
