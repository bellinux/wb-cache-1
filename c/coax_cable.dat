25|$|Telecommunications {{engineering}} {{focuses on the}} transmission of information across a channel such as a <b>coax</b> <b>cable,</b> optical fiber or free space. Transmissions across free space require information to be encoded in a carrier signal to shift the information to a carrier frequency suitable for transmission; {{this is known as}} modulation. Popular analog modulation techniques include amplitude modulation and frequency modulation. The choice of modulation affects the cost and performance of a system and these two factors must be balanced carefully by the engineer.|$|E
2500|$|The {{signalling}} {{technology used}} {{on all three}} SkyTrain lines to run trains automatically was originally developed by Alcatel, and loaded from a 3.5" [...] diskette. There are four systems called the VCC (Vehicle Control Computer) with three divided over the mainline {{and one for the}} storage yard. VCC1 controls trains from Waterfront to Royal Oak; VCC2 controls trains from Royal Oak to King George (it now also controls a portion of the Millennium line); and VCC3 controls trains in the yard. Each VCC is a cluster of three IBM rack-mount computers with Intel-IA32 processors and proprietary hardware, configured in a fault tolerant setup. For every command that is sent to a VCC, {{at least two of the}} computers must agree with the action, otherwise an error is generated and the command is ignored. The VCCs communicates with the train's VOBC (Vehicle On Board Computer), whose data is transmitted through leaky <b>coax</b> <b>cable</b> laid along the tracks. There are up to two VOBCs per married-pair trains, i.e., 4-car train would have two VOBCs. If the VCCs fail or communication between the VCC and the VOBC is lost, the train will 'time-out' and (EB) emergency-brake through a Quester Tangent BAM (Brake Assurance Monitor) that controls propulsion and braking systems. The VCCs have a command-line-console, but normally the trains are controlled through a system known as the SMC, which also provides scheduling. All commands from the SMC are verified to be safe by the VCC before execution. However if the SMC fails, the system can still be operated through the VCC. This is known as 'degraded mode'. The SkyTrain HMU (Health Monitoring Unit) developed by Quester Tangent [...] provides monitoring and diagnostic functionality for vehicle maintenance by connecting to CAN vehicle network and providing a maintenance display in the Hoslter Panel.|$|E
50|$|<b>Coax</b> <b>cable</b> {{is often}} used to carry data/signals from an antenna to a receiver—from a {{satellite}} dish to a satellite receiver, from a television antenna to a television receiver, from a radio mast to a radio receiver, etc.In many cases, the same single <b>coax</b> <b>cable</b> carries power in the opposite direction, to the antenna, to power the low-noise amplifier.In some cases a single <b>coax</b> <b>cable</b> carries (unidirectional) power and bidirectional data/signals, as in DiSEqC.|$|E
50|$|An {{additional}} new feature, FPD-Link III stops using LVDS {{technology and}} uses only CML for the serialized high-speed signals. This enables it to easily work at data rates greater than 3 Gbit/s on cables greater than 10m long. An additional benefit for using CML is the coax-cable drive capability. The CML technology works well when driving the single conductor in <b>coax</b> <b>cables.</b> Since <b>coax</b> <b>cables</b> {{are very good}} at controlling impedance and noise, they reduce the need for differential signaling, which better tolerates impedance discontinuities and noise interference.|$|R
50|$|A Tee {{connector}} is {{an electrical}} connector that connects three cables together. It is {{usually in the}} shape of a capital T.

50|$|DS3 {{signals are}} rare except within buildings, {{where they are}} used for {{interconnections}} and as an intermediate step before being muxed onto a SONET circuit. This is because a T3 circuit can only go about 600 ft between repeaters. A customer who orders a DS3 usually receives a SONET circuit run into the building and a multiplexer mounted in a utility box. The DS3 is delivered in its familiar form, two <b>coax</b> <b>cables</b> (1 for send and 1 for receive) with BNC connectors on the ends.|$|R

In a 10BASE2 network, each stretch of cable {{is connected to the}} transceiver (which is usually built into the network adaptor) using a BNC T-connector, with one stretch connected to each female connector of the T. The T-connector must be plugged directly into the network adaptor with no cable in between.|$|R

5000|$|Many power strips have {{built-in}} surge protectors or EMI/RFI filters: {{these are}} sometimes described as surge suppressors or electrical line conditioners.

5000|$|Several MAC/PHY {{specifications}} {{and standards}} are currently deployed or being developed which operate over existing wires within the home (e.g. AC power lines, <b>coax</b> <b>cabling,).</b> These wires are electrically [...] "Shared" [...] between multiple devices (not point-to-point like Ethernet), so to provide predictable performance, {{transmission of information}} onto the wire is [...] "Coordinated" [...] to avoid collisions {{by one of the}} devices on the network.

50|$|Satellite {{television}}, {{cable television}} and over-the-air (OTA) signals {{as well as}} locally generated programming such as hotel guest welcome screens and other hotel information and services can be distributed via an L-Band type system, COM1000 or COM2000 HD Pro:Idiom Headend from Technicolor, and Code Plus Headend from LG, or an IPTV type distribution system. In most hotels, a television signal provided by a satellite television or cable television provider or OTA antenna is transmitted over a hotel coaxial cable network. Most hotels today are wired only with coaxial cables, a big obstacle for implementing IP-based hotel television systems. Some newer hotels are pre-wired with UTP or CAT-5/6 cabling, which enables IP-based hotel television services. For hotels wired with coaxial cable, technology has emerged recently which enables some {{to take advantage of}} IP-based signal transmission over <b>coax</b> <b>cables.</b>|$|R
40|$|Josephson {{junction}} parametric amplifiers {{are playing}} {{a crucial role in}} the readout chain in superconducting quantum information experiments. However, their integration with current 3 D cavity implementations poses the problem of transitioning between waveguide, <b>coax</b> <b>cables</b> and planar circuits. Moreover, Josephson amplifiers require auxiliary microwave components, like directional couplers and/or hybrids, that are sources of spurious losses and impedance mismatches that limit measurement efficiency and amplifier tunability. We have developed a new wireless architecture for these parametric amplifiers that eliminates superfluous microwave components and interconnects. This greatly simplifies their assembly and integration into experiments. We present an experimental realization of such a device operating in the $ 9 - 11 $ GHz band with about $ 100 $ MHz of amplitude gain-bandwidth product, on par with devices mounted in conventional sample holders. The simpler impedance environment presented to the amplifier also results in increased amplifier tunability. Comment: 6 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

50|$|Another {{significant}} advantage ARCNET {{had over}} Ethernet was cable distance. ARCNET <b>coax</b> <b>cable</b> runs could extend 2000 ft between active hubs or between an active hub {{and an end}} node, while the RG-58 (50Ω) 'thin' Ethernet most widely used {{at that time was}} limited to a maximum run of 600 ft from end to end.|$|E
50|$|Simple analog {{videophone}} communication {{could be}} established {{as early as}} the invention of the television.

40|$|An {{architecture}} {{for integrating}} {{large numbers of}} data storage units (drives) to form a distributed mass storage system is proposed. The network of interconnected units consists of nodes and links. At each node there resides a controller board, a data storage unit and, possibly, a local/remote user-terminal. The links (twisted-pair wires, <b>coax</b> <b>cables,</b> or fiber-optic channels) provide the communications backbone of the network. There is no central controller for {{the system as a}} whole; all decisions regarding allocation of resources, routing of messages and data-blocks, creation and distribution of redundant data-blocks throughout the system (for protection against possible failures), frequency of backup operations, etc., are made locally at individual nodes. The system can handle as many user-terminals as there are nodes in the network. Various users compete for resources by sending their requests to the local controller-board and receiving allocations of time and storage space. In principle, each user can have access to the entire system, and all drives can be running in parallel to service the requests for one or more users. The system is expandable up to a maximum number of nodes, determined by the number of routing-buffers built into the controller boards. Additional drives, controller-boards, user-terminals, and links can be simply plugged into an existing system in order to expand its capacity...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) and {{magnetic resonance spectroscopy}} (MRS) are preferred methods of gathering information from the body due to their non-invasive approach of obtaining a diagnosis. MRI can obtain spatial mappings from a region of interest, while MRS can obtain metabolic information from different elements. Dual-tuned radiofrequency (RF) coils are able to capture signals produced by both hydrogen atoms and a second atom of interest. Unwanted shield currents occur in these scans, which can cause image distortion, while the high energy dissipated can create harmful heat, which can injure the patient. These shield currents, also known as common-mode currents, need to be suppressed in the RF coils by non-magnetic current traps, or chokes. Typically, chokes are soldered directly onto the <b>coax</b> <b>cables</b> and require precise placement. In this paper, a novel dual-tuned current choke that is not soldered to the cable is presented. The design was manufactured with 3 D printing to allow for optimal customization. The current trap attenuates shield currents at the Larmor frequency for hydrogen and phosphorous at 3 T, 127. 74 MHz and 51. 72 MHz by - 17. 8 dB and - 8. 39 dB respectively. This novel device facilitates dual-tuned coil operation by not having to place two current traps for two frequencies, while also being able to relocate the trap to where common-mode currents are highest...|$|R
