This floor slab is proposed as ARC (Automation-oriented Reinforced Concrete Constructions) floor systems. Using the equivalent flexural rigidity for the double layered floor slabs consisting of two different elastic moduli, analytical solutions expressed in Fourier series by thin plate theory and by elementary beam theory can be easily applied to the composite floor slabs. As a result of this analytical investigation, elastic deflection and stress resultants of the composite floor slabs are discussed in this paper. And the calculation charts on deflection and stress resultants of the floor slab are prepared for the purpose of structural design on the composite floor slabs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{the newly}} {{developed}} excavation system {{for construction of}} basement of building, steel elements plays a role as temporary member before <b>casting</b> <b>floor</b> concrete, but it do behavior as composite beam mixed with concrete after floor slab has been casted. That is, {{it is necessary to}} review if axial stress loaded in steel beam can be conveyed properly to slab, as casting concrete slab under conditions of application of compression to the steel beam In this manner, this paper presents the experimental result of the composite beam subjected to both constant axial load and variable vertical load. Main parameters in the test are magnitude and loading time of axial force. As a result, it was found that there was no effect on the flexural strength according to the timing of compression and axial force. The flexural strength of the composite beam subjected to both a constant axial compression and increasing vertical load could be predicted with somewhat safety by using code equations...|$|E
40|$|It {{is hard to}} {{envisage}} representative government, save in terms of unified political parties. Legislative voting unity is a precondition for responsible party government. Existing scholarship has focused extensively on explaining patterns of unified party voting within legislatures by references to presidential versus parliamentary forms of government (see, for example, Bowler et al. 1999; Carey 2007; Tsebelis 2002). Institutions associated with parliamentary systems, such as the vote of confidence mechanism, are said to enhance party voting unity (Huber 1996). Explanations of variation in party voting unity across parliamentary regimes have been limited. Our aim, beyond a mere description of the behaviour of legislators in <b>casting</b> <b>floor</b> votes, is {{to build on the}} scarce exceptions that attempt to link party unity in the legislature and the varying degree to which electoral and other institutions shape the behaviour of legislators (Carey 2007; Hix 2004; Hix et al. 2005; Sieberer 2006), and progress towards a general, comparative framework that allows us to explain variation in the level of party voting not just between different political systems but also between parties operating in the same political system.

Where, these samples classified within the acceptable tests were adopted in the implementation of investment projects in the construction sector. The research aims first, to measure the compressive strength of concrete cubes because the decrease or increase the compressive strength from specification design contributes to the failure of investment projects in the construction sector therefore, test was classified units that produced within damaged units. Second, to study an improvement the quality of compressive strength of concrete cubes.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{one part of}} a lean project {{initiated}} by Luvata Sweden AB in Finspang casting department. The primary goal of that project is to increase the production efficiency, reduce costs and improve the quality of the copper coil. The aim of this thesis is to develop standardized work in casting department at Luvata Sweden AB Finspang. The research is based on lean thinking and organized in three steps. FIRST STEP: This step implies value stream mapping (VSM) of the current manufacturing process. VSM technique is applied in order to create an overview of the entirety production flow in a casting department, to visualize non-value added activities and to identify process wastes. SECOND STEP: By using lean tools as: Waste Management, SMED and Visual Management, thesis work intends to clean the production process. 7 Wastes or seven forms of Muda were studied at Luvata Finspang. The source of 5 wastes were identified and reduced/eliminated. SMED (single minute exchange of dies) analysis was carried out for a changeover during a casting montage {{in order to reduce the}} changeover time and streamline the montage process. Spaghetti diagram was applied particularly to inspect the best location for all montage materials, equipments and tools in a <b>casting</b> <b>floor.</b> Ensuring the efficient implementation of Waste Management and SMED practices Visual Management technique was used. This mean expresses the information about production process, its real-time status and results in a way that could be understood by operators in a shop floor. It is important to clean a production process before the standardized work can be developed, since the purpose of standardized work is to represent the best practice: method and sequence for each process. THIRD STEP: The last thesis step focuses on developing standardized work sheets as a steering tool for operators to follow the best practice while executing their tasks in each work center (melting, casting, rolling) and during the casting montage. The standardized work sheets are designed to show the approved way to perform the specific procedures and are expected to motivate operators to perform theirs job in the common way. That would consequently reduce high variation in operators performance. It would probably take several years before any reasonable improvements could be observed. However the developed standardized work sheets are already placed in the shop floor and successfully used by operators this is my small contribution to a big improvement project...|$|E

Based on the non-linear thermal analysis of the different configurations by FEM and considering both upward and downward heat flows, it is possible to choose the best candidate floor from the thermal point of view. Mathematically, the non-linearity is due to the radiation boundary condition inside the recesses of the blocks. The comparative analysis of the floors is carried out from the finite element analysis through the two important parameters: the average mass overall thermal efficiency and the equivalent thermal conductivity.

40|$|A typical {{construction}} {{procedure for}} a multi-storey reinforced concrete building involves supporting newly cast slabs {{on a number}} of previously <b>cast</b> <b>floors</b> through a reshore system. The loads transferred by the forms to the previously cast partially cured supporting slabs may appreciably exceed the design capacity. A further complication is that large early-age construction loads applied to immature slabs will cause large immediate deflections and extensive flexural cracking. The large ratio of applied stress to developed strength, coupled with the low elastic moduli of the immature slabs, will cause significant creep, mostly non-recoverable, resulting in large longterm deflections. Shrinkage, though a non-stress originated concrete deformation phenomena, also affects concrete deformation and needs to be accounted for in calculations to predict longterm deflections. Most cases of deflection damage occur as a result of exceeding the permissible deflection of slabs supporting non-structural elements. This creates serviceability problems such as cracked partitions, jamming of doors and windows, and an uneven placement of furniture. In most cases, the visual impact of cracks and sagging floors may cause concern for safety of the structure even if the structure has adequate strength. Problems related to excessive slab deflection constitutes a serviceability limit state. Current deflection control provisions of the ACI and CSA codes do not address the sensitivity of slab deflections to early-age construction loading and schedule. The present study develops a more realistic span-thickness criterion which includes the effect of early-age construction loads, concrete strength and panel aspect ratio. Undesirable slab deflections can be reduced by appropriately chosen camber in the formwork. The concept is to use a prescribed camber to offset the immediate deflections. An equation is recommended for the estimation of the amount of camber needed for any given span...|$|R
