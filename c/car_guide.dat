5000|$|The {{view of the}} Daily Express World <b>Car</b> <b>Guide</b> 1998, {{edited by}} Peter Burgess, was that the XM was [...] "as {{distinctive}} an executive class car as its possible to find."

50|$|KRISTI was {{technically}} interesting, but {{the company}} failed to produce quantities of snowcats to compete with other North American or European snowcat manufacturers. According to the July 1964 issue of VOLKSWAGEN FOREIGN <b>CAR</b> <b>GUIDE</b> magazine, author Alan Arnold indicated the KRISTI had a unique ability to raise or lower its tracks individually which {{had the effect of}} raising one side of the vehicle to keep the vehicle level while crossing side slopes. Further, the front or rear of both tracks could be raised or lowered so the snowcat's cabin could remain level while climbing or descending slopes.|$|E

5000|$|In a poll {{conducted}} by Britain's Classic & Sports Car magazine and printed in their April 1999 edition, the Mercedes-Benz 6.9 ranked fourth {{on their list}} of the [...] "world's greatest saloons." [...] The May 2004 edition of another British publication, Mercedes Enthusiast magazine, ranked the 6.9 number fifteen on their all-time top twenty list of great Mercedes-Benz automobiles. Even with such accolades, a 6.9 is a reasonably priced collectible automobile despite its rarity. The online NADA Used <b>Car</b> <b>Guide</b> lists a top value of US$40,000. At present, the market for cars of this type is somewhat soft, and a prime example {{can be had for}} considerably less. As is often the case with older cars that contain exotic engineering and parts unique to that one model, however, running and maintenance costs for a 6.9 can quickly overshadow a low initial purchase price.|$|E
5000|$|The Daily Express World <b>Car</b> <b>Guide</b> 1999, {{edited by}} Peter Burgess, said [...] "Citroens largest car {{is also the}} most quirky." [...] But the XM [...] "is not without its qualities though, with a smooth ride and mile-munching {{motorway}} ability." [...] The depreciation to which the car was prone had become part of the cars identity in many reviews. Typical is [...] "only a few hundred are sold and values plummet on the used market." [...] The 2.1- and 2.5-litre diesels were said to be [...] "stars of the range with economy and reasonable performance." [...] In contrast to earlier reviews, the Guide thought the interiors were [...] "fragile." [...] But the ergonomics remained a point of criticism: [...] "the interior takes some getting used to." [...] Referring to the load carrying capacity of the estate, the Guide said the car was [...] "capable of carrying more than some vans." ...|$|E
50|$|Bryan {{learned about}} the German {{invasion}} of Poland on September 3 while traveling by train to Warsaw. He arrived in Warsaw on September 7 carrying his Leica still camera, Bell & Howell movie camera and 6000 feet of film, just as all foreigners, diplomats and government official were fleeing the capital. He contacted mayor of Warsaw Stefan Starzynski who provided him with a <b>car,</b> <b>guide</b> and interpreter Stefan Radlinski and permit to travel and photograph across Warsaw. In two weeks between September 7 and September 21, he managed to take hundreds of still photographs and 5000 feet of motion picture film documenting the Siege of Warsaw and the terror bombing of the city by German Luftwaffe. He is credited as the only foreign journalist in Warsaw at that time. Through Polish Radio he also made {{an appeal to the}} American president Franklin Delano Roosevelt to help civilians targeted by enemy bombers. During his stay in Warsaw he lived in the abandoned Consulate of the United States.He left Warsaw on September 21 after Germans declared a cease-fire to allow citizens of neutral countries to depart by train through East Prussia. In Koenigsberg fearing confiscation of his material he decided to smuggle out his already developed films. He managed to hide some of his films in souvenir gas mask containers collected by fellow traveler from US, by one account he hid some movies by wrapping them around his torso.|$|E

A mathematical model for the elevator system is derived, and a stochastic model for the rail profile irregularities is constructed. This model of uncertainties describes the rail profile as a random field, which is represented by means of Karhunen-Loeve expansion. Polynomial chaos is employed to compute the propagation of uncertainties through the stochastic model, in order to evaluate the disturbance rejection properties and robustness of the closed-loop system...|$|E
