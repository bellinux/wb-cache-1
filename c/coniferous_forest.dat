5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} is {{the most}} widespread member of its genus, breeding in temperate woodlands across Eurasia from Ireland to Japan. It prefers mature trees, and in most of Europe, where it shares its range with short-toed treecreeper, {{it tends to be}} found mainly in <b>coniferous</b> <b>forest,</b> especially spruce and fir. However, where it is the only treecreeper, as in European Russia, or the British Isles, it frequents broadleaved or mixed woodland in preference to conifers.|$|E
5|$|The {{watershed}} {{is covered}} predominantly by temperate <b>coniferous</b> <b>forest,</b> which makes up approximately 64 {{percent of the}} total area. The primary species in these areas are Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, madrone, and incense-cedar. Buckbrush and manzanita grow in the drier chaparral regions. Several rare plants including Gentner's fritillary, oblongleaf stonecrop, Siskiyou lewisia, clustered lady's slipper, and splithair Indian paintbrush also grow in the watershed. Seven species of noxious weeds have been identified: three species of thistles, medusahead rye, Scotch broom, St. Johns wort, and tansy ragwort.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that this species has changed its natural habitat in at least parts of its range. In Germany and elsewhere in central Europe, it was found only in <b>coniferous</b> <b>forest</b> until the mid-1920s when its range rapidly expanded, first into farmland, and then to suburbs and urban parks. The reasons for this expansion are unclear. In areas of intensive farming, such as eastern England, arable land has in turn largely been abandoned in favour of built-up areas with their greater variety of green habitats.|$|E
50|$|The {{vegetation}} types {{present in}} the Rajparian Wildlife Sanctuary include dense <b>coniferous</b> <b>forests</b> and sub-alpine pastures. In dense <b>coniferous</b> <b>forests,</b> kail pine, spruce, fir, birch, deodar and juniper trees are predominant.|$|R
5000|$|Temperate zones support both {{broadleaf}} deciduous forests (e.g., temperate deciduous <b>forest)</b> and evergreen <b>coniferous</b> <b>forests</b> (e.g., temperate <b>coniferous</b> <b>forests</b> and temperate rainforests). Warm temperate zones support broadleaf evergreen forests, including laurel forests.|$|R
50|$|The <b>coniferous</b> <b>forests</b> occur from 1,000 to 4,000 m altitudes. Chitral, Swat, Upper Dir, Lower Dir, Malakand, Mansehra and Abbottabad {{district}}s of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Azad Kashmir and Rawalpindi district of the Punjab {{are the main}} areas covered with <b>coniferous</b> <b>forests.</b> Pindrow Fir(Abies pindrow), Morinda spruce (Picea smithiana), deodar (Cedrus deodara), blue pine (Pinus wallichiana), chir pine (Pinus roxburghii) {{are the most common}} varieties. The <b>Coniferous</b> <b>forests</b> also occur in Balochistan hills. Chilghoza pine (Pinus gerardiana) and juniper (Juniperous macropoda) are the two most common species of Balochistan.|$|R
5|$|In Tibet, {{the species}} {{has been found}} in the northeastern Tibet Autonomous Region in the Chamdo Prefecture; and in the {{southeast}} of the region in Tse (in December) and in Dzeng (in April), both in the South Tibet (Tsangpo) Valley region. The Tsangpo Valley sightings may be anomalous, only indicating winter visitation. The bird observed in Dzeng was in an environment alien to the species' normal <b>coniferous</b> <b>forest</b> environs, and both the Dzeng and Tse individuals had atypically pale underparts, indicating they may have been nominate S. leucopsis, but with genetic introgression traits from Przevalski's nuthatch.|$|E
5|$|The Chetco River {{watershed}} {{is covered}} primarily by temperate <b>coniferous</b> <b>forest,</b> which includes {{species such as}} Douglas fir, western hemlock, white fir, Port Orford cedar, California incense cedar, and Sitka spruce. Jeffrey pine, knobcone pine, and golden chinquapin have also been identified. Hardwoods including tanoak, bigleaf maple, red alder, and Pacific madrone are common. Manzanita, hazelnut, vine maple, western skunk cabbage, and multiple species of berries and grasses make up the understory. Kalmiopsis, a flowering evergreen shrub and the namesake of the Kalmiopsis Wilderness, only grows in the Siskiyou Mountains. Several noxious weeds have also been identified, including gorse, Scotch broom, blackberries, and thistles.|$|E
5|$|The Great Basin, Mojave Desert, and Colorado Plateau {{converge}} at Zion and the Kolob canyons. This, {{along with}} the varied topography of canyon–mesa country, differing soil types, and uneven water availability, provides diverse habitat for the equally diverse mix {{of plants and animals}} that live in the area. The park is home to 289 bird, 79 mammals, 28 reptiles, 7 fish, and 6 amphibian species. These organisms make their homes in one or more of four life zones found in the Park: desert, riparian, woodland, and <b>coniferous</b> <b>forest.</b>|$|E

5|$|Gyromitra esculenta {{grows on}} sandy soil in Temperate <b>coniferous</b> <b>forest</b> and {{occasionally}} in deciduous woodlands. Among conifers {{it is mostly}} found under pines (Pinus spp.), but also sometimes under aspen (Populus spp.). The hunting period is from April to July, earlier than for other species, and the fungus may even sprout up with the melting snow. It can be abundant in some years and rare in others. The mushroom is more commonly found in places where ground has been disturbed, such as openings, rivulets, washes, timber clearings, plowed openings, forest fire clearings, and roadsides. Enthusiasts in Finland have been reported burying newspaper inoculated with the fungus in the ground in autumn and returning the following spring to collect mushrooms.|$|E
5|$|In cool {{temperate}} regions, conifers often predominate; {{a widely}} distributed climax {{community in the}} far north of the northern hemisphere is moist taiga or northern <b>coniferous</b> <b>forest</b> (also called boreal forest). Taiga is the world's largest land biome, forming 29% of the world's forest cover. The long cold winter of the far north is unsuitable for plant growth and trees must grow rapidly in the short summer season when the temperature rises and the days are long. Light is very limited under their dense cover {{and there may be}} little plant life on the forest floor, although fungi may abound. Similar woodland is found on mountains where the altitude causes the average temperature to be lower thus reducing the length of the growing season.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} birds have been spotted in the Little Butte Creek region. Twenty-two species are known to breed in the {{chaparral}} region, including several species of wrens, blackbirds, and sparrows. The mixed <b>coniferous</b> <b>forest</b> is home to white-headed woodpeckers, pygmy nuthatches, green-tailed towhees, northern pygmy-owls, Vaux's swifts, winter wrens, and MacGillivray's warblers. The American coot has also been spotted in several places along the creek. Williamson's sapsuckers, black-backed woodpeckers, gray jays, and hermit warblers frequent the higher elevations. The near-threatened olive-sided flycatcher and Cassin's finch also live in this area. Eurasian three-toed woodpeckers and Clark's nutcrackers have been spotted near the tree line. The endangered Townsend's big-eared bat is known {{to live in the}} watershed.|$|E

5|$|Mycena galericulata is saprobic, {{and grows}} on {{decaying}} hardwood and softwood sticks, chips, logs, and stumps. It can also grow from submerged wood, which may {{give it a}} terrestrial appearance. It typically grows in small clusters or sometimes singly. The fungus fruits from late spring to early winter. A study of litter-decomposing fungi in a <b>coniferous</b> <b>forest</b> in Finland showed that M.galericulata produces extracellular hydrolytic enzymes in the humus and eluvial soil, including β-glucosidase, β-xylosidase, α-glucosidase, butyrate esterase and sulphatase. The enzymes form complexes with inorganic and organic particles in the soil and break down (depolymerize) biopolymers such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and starch, which contributes to the cycling of carbon and nutrients. The presence of lead contamination in the soil decreases both the growth and the extracellular hydrolytic enzyme activity of M.galericulata.|$|E
5|$|India {{lies within}} the Indomalaya ecozone and {{contains}} three biodiversity hotspots. One of 17 megadiverse countries, it hosts 8.6% of all mammalian, 13.7% of all avian, 7.9% of all reptilian, 6% of all amphibian, 12.2% of all piscine, and 6.0% of all flowering plant species. About 21.2% of the country's landmass {{is covered by}} forests (tree canopy density >10%), of which 12.2% comprises moderately or very dense forests (tree canopy density >40%). Endemism is high among plants, 33%, and among ecoregions such as the shola forests. Habitat ranges from the tropical rainforest of the Andaman Islands, Western Ghats, and North-East India to the <b>coniferous</b> <b>forest</b> of the Himalaya. Between these extremes lie the moist deciduous sal forest of eastern India; the dry deciduous teak forest of central and southern India; and the babul-dominated thorn forest of the central Deccan and western Gangetic plain. The medicinal neem, widely used in rural Indian herbal remedies, is a key Indian tree. The luxuriant pipal fig tree, shown on the seals of Mohenjo-daro, shaded Gautama Buddha as he sought enlightenment.|$|E
5|$|Roxy Ann Peak's high {{biodiversity}} {{is due to}} {{its wide}} range of elevations and its location between the Cascade, Klamath, and Eastern Cascade ecoregions. The lower slopes of the peak support chaparral, oak savanna, and open grassland. Scattered California black oak, Oregon white oak, and Pacific madrone trees grow in these areas, as do sclerophyllous shrubs such as birchleaf mountain mahogany, sticky whiteleaf manzanita, buckbrush, antelope bitterbrush, and Pacific poison oak. Common grasses include blue wildrye and prairie Junegrass. Wildflowers including Southern Oregon buttercup, common yarrow, and Tolmie star-tulip also grow in these regions. At higher elevations, the vegetation transitions to mixed <b>coniferous</b> <b>forest,</b> dominated by Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, incense cedar, western juniper, and Pacific madrone trees. Shrubs such as common snowberry, bearbrush, greenleaf manzanita, sticky whiteleaf manzanita, deerbrush, and Pacific poison oak make up the understory of the forest, along with herbaceous plants such as creeping snowberry and Idaho fescue.|$|E

5|$|There are {{numerous}} different microhabitats in a wood; <b>coniferous</b> <b>forest,</b> broad-leafed forest, open woodland, scattered trees, woodland verges, clearings and glades; tree trunk, branch, twig, bud, leaf, flower and fruit; rough bark, smooth bark, damaged bark, rotten wood, hollow, groove and hole; canopy, shrub layer, plant layer, leaf litter and soil; buttress root, stump, fallen log, stem base, grass tussock, fungus, fern and moss. The greater the structural {{diversity in the}} wood, the greater the number of microhabitats that will be present. A range of tree species with individual specimens of varying sizes and ages, {{and a range of}} features such as streams, level areas, slopes, tracks, clearings and felled areas will provide suitable conditions for an enormous number of biodiverse plants and animals. For example, in Britain {{it has been estimated that}} various types of rotting wood are home to over 1700 species of invertebrate.|$|E
5|$|SH74 {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} with I-70 in El Rancho. Ramps from I-70 westbound branch off the freeway's exit 252 {{from the north}} side and cross the highway southwestward. Access to SH74 from I-70 eastbound is provided via U.S. Highway 40 (US40) a slight distance to the west. From I-70, the roadway heads southwesterly through El Rancho, meeting an intersection with US40 (Swede Gulch Road). The route heads westward before turning southwestward into a <b>coniferous</b> <b>forest</b> setting as a four-lane divided highway. The roadway turns westward where it meets County Road 23 (CR 23, Kerr Gulch Road). Evergreen Parkway passes Fillius Park to the north {{in the community of}} Hidden Valley, where the terrain is mountainous. After intersecting Bergen Parkway, which heads southwesterly toward Bergen Park, SH74 turns to the south. The parkway meets Squaw Pass Road and crosses the Troublesome Creek before traveling along the west side of Buchanan Park. SH74 follows the east side of Elk Meadow Open Space Park, where open grassland is dotted with occasional trees. The road narrows to two lanes and climbs steeply at milepost five. While passing Wah Keeney Park, the road turns southeastward and continues to the community of Hiwan. SH74 enters the town of Evergreen, passing by a lake of the same name along Bear Creek in Dedisse Park. Here, the route intersects CR 74, which heads west along the Upper Bear Creek.|$|E
