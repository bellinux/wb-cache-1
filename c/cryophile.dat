50|$|Shewanella violacea is an obligate {{psychrophile}} (<b>cryophile).</b> Its optimum growth {{temperature is}} 8ᵒC. It {{is not able}} to grow or reproduce at 30ᵒC. S. violacea is a facultative piezophile (barophile) which means that it is able to thrive in high pressure conditions. S. violacea is able to grow in pressure conditions ranging from 0.1 to 70 MPa (3). Its ideal pressure is 30 MPa.|$|E

40|$|About this release This release {{features}} a large collection of classes representing polar and cryosphere-related environments and environmental processes, primarily prepared by @kaiiam. These semantics are in aid of efforts {{such as the}} Alfred Wegener Institute's Frontiers in Arctic Marine Monitoring programme. Knowledge was harvested from numerous resources - such as the review by Boetius et al. (2015, Nat Rev Microbiol 13 : 677 – 690) - which are cross referenced in each class. Efforts to align with existing resources have been initiated, e. g. : [URL] Past and ongoing work related to this project is organised in project <b>cryophile.</b> This work has also motivated the general development of the environmental process hierarchy. A number of other requests, such as that for fissures (see # 466) are also bundled in this release. As usual, the hyperlinks to the terms will be live once OntoBee runs its import cycle over the weekend; however, the PURLs are valid immediately. To better axiomatise the new classes and enhance existing ones, we have also imported numerous classes from other OBO projects, detailed below.

50|$|Psychrophiles or <b>cryophiles</b> (adj. cryophilic) are extremophilic {{organisms that}} {{are capable of}} growth and {{reproduction}} in cold temperatures, ranging from −20 °C to +10 °C.|$|R
25|$|Temperature affects {{almost all}} aspects of {{respiration}} processes. Temperature will increase respiration exponentially to a maximum, at which point respiration will decrease to zero when enzymatic activity is interrupted. Root respiration increases exponentially with temperature in its low range when the respiration rate is limited mostly by the TCA cycle. At higher temperatures the transport of sugars and the products of metabolism become the limiting factor. At temperatures over 35 degrees Celsius, root respiration begins to shut down completely. Microorganisms are divided into three temperature groups; <b>cryophiles,</b> mesophiles and thermophiles. <b>Cryophiles</b> function optimally at temperatures below 20 degrees Celsius, mesophiles function best at temperatures between 20 and 40 degrees Celsius and thermophiles function optimally at over 40 degrees Celsius. In natural soils many different cohorts, or groups of microorganisms exist. These cohorts will all function best at different conditions so respiration may occur over a very broad range. Temperature increases lead to greater rates of soil respiration until high values retard microbial function, {{this is the same}} pattern that is seen with soil moisture levels.|$|R
40|$|One hundred senventy-five {{species of}} marine mollusks have been {{identified}} in the Expedition Espírito Santo I. Standing out the species Margarites olivaceus (Brown, 1827); Cyclostremiscus caraboboensis Weishord, 1962; Balcis gibba Folin, 1867; Triphora compsa (Dall, 1927); Henrya af. goldmani Bartsh, 1947 and Limaea subovata Jeffreys, 1876 as they have not been previously assigned to Brazil. The analysis of the geographical distribution patterns points out the dominance of the species with thermophiles affinities. This situation evidences the importance of the Brazilian Current in the maintanance of the biogeographical structure of the studied region. However, it is the analysis of the <b>cryophiles</b> species that shows the Cabo Frio region as an ecological filter quite more permeable to the species with thermophile affinities than to the <b>cryophiles</b> ones. The existence of this barrier and the endemism rate (4. 27 %) characterize the region that extends from the south of Cabo Frio as a transition between the two patterns cited above. Therefore they do not corroborate in malacological parameters the proposition made by Palacio (1982) for the individualization of the Paulista Province...|$|R

50|$|Temperature affects {{almost all}} aspects of {{respiration}} processes. Temperature will increase respiration exponentially to a maximum, at which point respiration will decrease to zero when enzymatic activity is interrupted. Root respiration increases exponentially with temperature in its low range when the respiration rate is limited mostly by the TCA cycle. At higher temperatures the transport of sugars and the products of metabolism become the limiting factor. At temperatures over 35 degrees Celsius, root respiration begins to shut down completely. Microorganisms are divided into three temperature groups; <b>cryophiles,</b> mesophiles and thermophiles. <b>Cryophiles</b> function optimally at temperatures below 20 degrees Celsius, mesophiles function best at temperatures between 20 and 40 degrees Celsius and thermophiles function optimally at over 40 degrees Celsius. In natural soils many different cohorts, or groups of microorganisms exist. These cohorts will all function best at different conditions so respiration may occur over a very broad range. Temperature increases lead to greater rates of soil respiration until high values retard microbial function, {{this is the same}} pattern that is seen with soil moisture levels.|$|R
50|$|Cryozoa are organisms {{capable of}} {{surviving}} temperatures below 0°C for extended periods. Sperm and bacterial cultures are routinely preserved in liquid nitrogen at -196°C, while the nematode Panagrolaimus davidi can survive freezing {{of all of}} its body water. Other organisms such as some frogs, turtles and snakes may freeze their extracellular water to safeguard their cells during low temperatures and make use of antifreeze proteins. Cryozoa include <b>cryophiles,</b> which not only survive low temperatures, but are capable of growth and reproduction in such conditions.|$|R
