Contrary to the original objective, {{the relative importance of}} the five categories of risk importance (size, <b>cross-jurisdictional</b> <b>activity,</b> interconnectedness, substitutability/financial institution infrastructure, and complexity) may not be equal and the resulting systemic risk scores are mechanically dominated by the most volatile categories. In practice, this bias proved to be serious enough that the substitutability category had to be capped by the BCBS.

40|$|The {{researcher}} establishes, through {{review of}} literature on {{the theory of the}} firm, that the firm operates as a complex adaptive system, consisting of interdependent tangible <b>activity</b> <b>indicators</b> and intangible capabilities. These interdependent capabilities are ultimately the drivers for creating competitive advantage, which is made observable as the value of the firm. When evaluating firm value, experts in the field of capital appraisal make use of the standard DCF method that, however, accounts only for tangible <b>activity</b> <b>indicators</b> and does not explicitly examine the intangible capabilities of the firm. In an attempt to address the above limitation, the researcher develops a methodology aimed at explicitly evaluating firm capabilities in the context of firm valuation. In an effort to accomplish this task, the researcher adopts a qualitative and quantitative approach to identify and analyse the underlying constituents of firm capabilities. Through a series of discussions and group sessions with experts, the research identified 127 intangible <b>activity</b> <b>indicators,</b> which are summarised under eight higher order factors (capabilities). This structure is confirmed through PLS analysis that indicates the existence of the following eight intangible capabilities: (1) value for money, (2) product complexity, (3) distribution, (4) culture, (5) competition, (6) asset management, (7) environment and (8) market equity. Regression analysis confirms that intangible capabilities represent a better predictor for firm value than thangible <b>activity</b> <b>indicators.</b> The researcher also carries out bivariate correlation analyses in order to examine the interrelationship between tangible <b>activity</b> <b>indicators</b> and intangible capabilities. The results confirm that the tangible <b>activity</b> <b>indicators</b> are indeed embedded in the firm's intangible capabilities. Overall, the research adds knowledge in three areas. First, it extends the literature on capabilities and firm valuation by providing a superior way to DCF of evaluating firm value {{as a function of the}} firm's capabilities. Second, the research contributes to business practice by offering a step-wise procedure for explicitly evaluating firm capabilities. Third, the research adds knowledge to methods by identifying the intangible <b>activity</b> <b>indicators</b> through interviews and surveys with experts in the field of capital appraisal and reducing these <b>activity</b> <b>indicators</b> into capabilities using focus groups and PLS analysis...|$|R

40|$|Background The {{quality of}} life of adults with {{intellectual}} disabilities living in the family home is an under-researched area. The current study compared indicators of household and community activity between adults living in family homes and those in out-of-family placements. Methods Four datasets were merged to produce information on the household participation and social and community activities of 721 adult participants living independently (n = 30) or in family (n = 142) or staffed homes (n = 559). Data on age, gender, adaptive and challenging behaviour, and social impairment were also available. Participant characteristics and household and community <b>activity</b> <b>indicators</b> were compared across places of residence. In addition, for those living in family or staffed homes, multiple regression was used to examine the association between the <b>activity</b> <b>indicators</b> and place of residence after controlling for participant characteristics. Results People living independently had higher household participation. People living in staffed housing had higher household participation and did more community activities more frequently than people living in family homes. Place of residence was a significant factor after controlling for participant differences. Conclusions Interpretation should take account of the limited nature of the <b>activity</b> <b>indicators.</b> However, the comparison adds weight to other recent research suggesting that adults living in family homes may have fewer activity opportunities than those living in supported accommodation...|$|R
40|$|Inter-subject {{comparisons}} of {{heart rate variability}} (HRV) require that physical activity levels be matched between subjects, to minimize the confounding effects of intra-subject variability in HRV measurements.

This paper describes an “activity index ” (based on mean heart rate, total power of the observed heart rate signal, and a heart rate “stationarity index”), and presents an algorithm for locating periods of minimum activity by tracking this activity index. The algorithm was tested using a set of 35 ECG recordings for which an independent <b>activity</b> <b>indicator</b> was available.

40|$|This study {{attempts}} to provide quantitative {{estimates of the}} influence of changes in economic variables (relative prices and <b>activity</b> <b>indicators)</b> on electricity demand in Greece over the period 1961 - 1975. The fact that e 1 ectricity is not a product yielding direct satisfaction but it is demanded as a fuel input into activities that do provide utility, and which use a capital stock of some durability, creates the need for a distinction between demand in the short-run and demand in the long-run. Moreover, total electricity demand is disaggregated into demand by the household, commercial and industrial sectors. This disaggregation rests upon the assumption that the response of different sectors to changes in the economic environment is unlikely to be the same. The quantitative estimates suggest that in general short-run demand appears to be price and income inelastic for the household and commercial sectors, whereas for the industrial sector the evidence suggests a price elasticity very close to unity and an <b>activity</b> <b>indicator</b> (Index of Industrial Production) elasticity greater than unity. Long-run demand appears to be inelastic with respect to price changes only in the household sector. The <b>activity</b> <b>indicators</b> elasticities for all sectors are well above unity. The long-run formulations permit, the calculation of the speed with which actual demand adjusts to desired demand. The estimates suggest that this speed is relatively fast in the case of residential demand and relatively slow in the case of industrial demand...|$|R

Methods: Ten persons aged over 65 who had the first MI were visited during a period to two years after being released from hospital to carry out a prospective study. A semi-structured interview was conducted and the social <b>activity</b> <b>indicator</b> was used to measure social activity. Results : The score of the social <b>activity</b> <b>indicator</b> was thelowest in the third month after leaving hospital, which then increased up to the twelfth month.
