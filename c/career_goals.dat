5|$|The 1955–56 {{season was}} the first as head coach for Toe Blake, who was hired to help control Richard's temper. The 1956 victory began an {{unprecedented}} streak of five consecutive Stanley Cups for the Canadiens from 1956 to 1960; the 1960 final was Montreal's tenth consecutive appearance in the championship series. Richard, {{the first player to}} score 500 <b>career</b> <b>goals</b> in NHL history, retired in 1960 with 544 <b>career</b> <b>goals</b> and was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1961.

40|$|We {{tested a}} model {{based on the}} dual-process {{framework}} that assessed the relationships among personal resources, <b>career</b> <b>goal</b> appraisals, <b>career</b> attitudes, and <b>career</b> <b>goal</b> management, which have not been previously assessed together. The model (tested on a sample of 486 young adults: 74 % female, Mage 22 years) proposed that personal resources (assimilation and accommodation) were associated with <b>career</b> <b>goal</b> management strategies (goal engagement and disengagement) and that these relationships were mediated by <b>career</b> <b>goal</b> appraisals (perceived attainability, importance, and substitutability) and career attitudes (career optimism and locus of control). Career optimism mediated between assimilation and goal engagement, and importance mediated between accom-modation and goal disengagement. The results contribute {{to a better understanding}} of goal man-agement processes in the career domain and have implications for the application of the dual-process framework to career development in young adulthood.

40|$|Based on goal-setting theory, {{this study}} {{examined}} the relationship between negative <b>career</b> <b>goal</b> feedback and career-related stress, tested whether career goal–performance discrepancy operated as a mediator in this relationship, and assessed whether <b>career</b> <b>goal</b> importance strengthened the indirect effect of negative feedback on stress via discrepancy. Using a sample of 317 health profession university students (mean age = 19. 5 years), we found that negative feedback was associated positively with stress and that discrepancy mediated this relationship. Consistent with goal-setting theory, we also found that discrepancy was higher at higher levels of negative feedback for those with higher goal importance, and the indirect effect of negative feedback on stress through discrepancy increased with increasing goal importance. These findings highlight important roles for <b>career</b> <b>goal</b> feedback and <b>career</b> <b>goal</b> importance in young peoples’ <b>career</b> <b>goal</b> pursuit.

5|$|A 45-goal {{season in}} 1989–90 {{was enough for}} Nieuwendyk to lead the team in goal scoring for the third {{consecutive}} season. He missed he first 11 games of the 1991–92 NHL season after suffering a knee injury during a summer evaluation camp for the 1991 Canada Cup. Nieuwendyk began the season as the 12th captain in the Flames franchise history. He was limited to 22 goals and 56 points on the season, but scored his 200th career goal on December 3, 1991, against the Detroit Red Wings. His 230th career goal, scored against the Tampa Bay Lightning on November 13, 1992, established a Flames franchise record for <b>career</b> <b>goals</b> (since broken).|$|E
5|$|A bicycle kick's {{successful}} performance generally requires great {{skill and}} athleticism. The performer needs to maintain good form when executing the move, and must simultaneously exhibit exceptional {{accuracy and precision}} when striking the ball. Sports historian Richard Witzig recommends that footballers attempt executing a bicycle kick with a focused and determined state of mind. Due to the action's complexity, a successfully executed bicycle kick is notable and, according to sports journalist Elliott Turner, prone to awe audiences. Brazilian forward Pelé, one of the sport's renowned players, also considers the manoeuvre difficult and recalled having scored from it {{only a few times}} out of his 1,283 <b>career</b> <b>goals.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the 1999–2000 season, Sakic reached several career milestones. Injuries limited him to only 60 games, but {{he still}} managed to lead the team in scoring with 81 points. On December 27, 1999, against the St. Louis Blues, Sakic earned an assist to become the 56th player in NHL history to reach 1,000 career points. Later in the season, on March 23, 2000, he scored a hat trick against the Phoenix Coyotes, and became the 59th player to score 400 <b>career</b> <b>goals.</b> It also gave him 1,049 points with the Quebec/Colorado franchise, passing Peter Šťastný as the all-time leader on the team.|$|E

5|$|McDonald {{became the}} 21st player in NHL history to score 400 <b>career</b> <b>goals,</b> {{reaching}} the mark in a 7–4 loss in Los Angeles on December 21, 1983. He was initially credited with scoring the milestone goal {{in his previous}} game, against the Winnipeg Jets, but after reviewing a replay of the goal himself, McDonald asked the league to credit it to teammate Eddy Beers who had deflected his shot. His injury problems worsened in 1984–85 as he missed {{the start of the}} season with pulled muscles and was limited to just 43games.|$|E

5|$|In 1924, {{the tournament}} was {{played in a}} {{round-robin}} format, consisting of a preliminary round and a medal round. The medals were awarded based on win–loss records during the medal round. This format was used until 1988, {{although the number of}} teams and games played varied slightly. The Toronto Granites, representing Canada, became one of the dominant hockey teams in Olympic history, outscoring opponents 110–3, led by Harry Watson, who scored 36 goals. The United States won silver and Great Britain won bronze. Watson's 36 goals remains the tournament record for <b>career</b> <b>goals.</b> He also set the record for career points with 36 (assists were not counted at the time), which stood until 2010.|$|E

5|$|After his stint {{with the}} Penguins in 2015, Sprong rejoined the Islanders for the {{remainder}} of the 2015–16 season. He played 33 games for the Islanders and recorded 46 points. The team made the playoffs, where Sprong scored a further 15 points before the team was eliminated in the second round. An injury sustained during practice with the Penguins during the 2016 Stanley Cup playoffs kept Sprong out until January, 2017 when he rejoined Charlottetown. He only played 31 games that season, but finished with 59 points, the highest points-per-game average in the entire league. He finished his career with the Islanders with the third goals and second most points in team history, and during the playoffs he tied the record for most <b>career</b> <b>goals</b> and broke the records for most assists and points. Sprong led the Islanders in scoring with 20 points in 12 games as the team lost in the third round of the playoffs, ending his junior career. Following that he was recalled again by the Penguins to train with them during their time in the NHL playoffs.|$|E
5|$|In March 1955, Richard was {{suspended}} {{for the remainder of}} the season, including the playoffs, after he received a match penalty for slashing Boston's Hal Laycoe then punching a linesman who attempted to intervene. The suspension touched off a wave of anger towards league president Clarence Campbell, who was warned not to attend a scheduled game in Montreal after receiving numerous death threats, mainly from French-Canadians accusing him of anti-French bias. Campbell dismissed the warnings, and attended the March 17 game as planned. His presence at the game was perceived by many fans as a provocation and he was booed and pelted with eggs and fruit. An hour into the game, a fan lobbed a tear-gas bomb in Campbell's direction, and firefighters decided to clear the building. Fans leaving the game and a growing mob of angry demonstrators rioted outside of the Montreal Forum, which became known as l'affaire Richard, or the Richard Riot. Richard became the first player to score 500 <b>career</b> <b>goals</b> on October 19, 1957. He retired in 1960 as an eight-time Stanley Cup champion, as well as the NHL's all-time leading scorer with 544 goals.|$|E
5|$|The 1931–32 {{season was}} another {{productive}} season for Morenz. With 49 points he {{finished third in}} league scoring, {{and became the first}} player in NHL history to win the Hart Trophy for a third time, also being named to the First All-Star Team again. In a March 17, 1932, game against the New York Americans, Morenz scored his 334th point with an assist, passing Cy Denneny as the NHL record holder for career points. Minor injuries led to Morenz's point totals going down the following season as he finished second on the Canadiens in scoring behind Joliat, the first time in seven years he did not lead the Canadiens, ending up 10th in the league with 35 points. In the playoffs, he had three assists in two games. The 1933–34 season also saw Morenz's goal and point totals fall, to 8 goals and 21 points. Even with his decline in scoring, he still managed to reach a significant milestone, once again passing Cy Denneny to do so. Against the Detroit Red Wings on December 23, 1933, he scored his 249th career goal, to become the NHL leader for <b>career</b> <b>goals.</b> On January 2, 1934, Morenz twisted his ankle in a game in New York, bruising the bone and tearing ligaments. It was the first serious injury of his career, and he was unable to play for a month. After returning to the team, Morenz was unable to play at his previous level, and the Canadiens' fans began booing him.|$|E
