50|$|Few {{commercial}} {{feature recognition}} systems are also available. Though feature recognition {{technology can be}} applied for various applications, commercial software have effectively adopted feature recognition technology for recreating the feature tree from imported models so that even the imported models can be edited {{as if it were}} a native solid model. Major 3D CAD modelers have Feature Recognition to convert imported 3-D models into native feature based models. CAM software and design for manufacturing software are also built using this feature recognition technology. Few CAD/CAM software have used commercially available third-party feature recognition library, which recognizes various features from 3-D B-Rep models. Separate libraries are available for Design, Manufacturing and Sheet metal applications. Design feature recognition library can identify features such as holes of various types, split holes, hole-chains, fillets, chamfers, cut extrudes, boss extrudes, drafted extrudes, revolved cuts, revolved bosses, ribs, drafts, lofts and sweeps are identified. Manufacturing feature recognition library provides recognition of manufacturing features such as simple holes, tapered holes, <b>counter-bore</b> holes, counter-sunk holes, counter-drilled holes, hole-chains, hole patterns such as linear, rectangular and circular patterns, fillets, chamfers, blind pockets, through pockets, drafted pockets, filleted and chamfered pockets, simple slots, drafted slots, filleted and chamfered slots, islands in pockets and slots, machinable volumes, machinable slabs, multiple intersecting features, axi-symmetric features such as external turned profiles, internal turned profiles, turned grooves such as vee and dovetail grooves, and mill-turn features such as slots and pocket in turned profiles. Sheet metal feature recognition library extracts features from a sheet metal perspective. Various features identified through this library include walls, bends, holes, cutouts, flanged holes, flanged cutouts, notches, open hems, closed hems, teardrop hems, rolled hems (curls), jog flanges, edge flanges, contour flanges, stamps such as louver, lance, bridge, dimple, beads, embosses and ribs. Though such commercial systems can identify a variety of features listed above, further research can be driven to identify feature types that are not identified by such commercial systems. Manufacturing features such as 3-axis and 5-axis feature recognition are generally not available in such commercial systems.|$|E
40|$|The NSTX upgrade project {{requires}} analysis {{qualifications of}} existing vacuum vessel and passive stabilizing plates for increased plasma performance. Vertical stability is critically {{dependent on the}} passive conducting structure that surrounds the plasma. In this paper, the passive conducting structure is analyzed for the upgrade condition during plasma disruption to ensure the level of stress in the stabilizing plates and the fastener is within its design limits. The <b>counter-bore</b> of the passive plates for bolting is evaluated in details and <b>counter-bore</b> bushing is redesigned to prevent shear failure during disruptions {{as a result of}} high pulling and pushing forces, particularly for support at the corner bolt...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} critical study of injector nozzle geometry on high-pressure Gasoline Direct Injection, GDi, injector spray morphology. The {{study was conducted}} with the aid of multi-fluid Volume-of-Fluid, Large-Eddy-Simulation, VOF-LES, method. Alternative nozzle geometries, that are the subject of current interest including varying nozzle hole length to diameter ratio, <b>counter-bore</b> presence and nozzle-hole skew-angle geometry, are studied in detail in order to provide insight into their specific influence on spray plume targeting and jet primary breakup characteristics. A comparison of the simulation results with near-field shadowgraph and Mie scatter imaging as well as phase-contrast x-ray imaging is provided. When near-field experimental imaging validated the simulation results further investigation of the fundamental flow mechanism internal to the injector was studied using VOF-LES to gain insight to the cause of spray morphology changes within the injector valve group. The complementary analysis of Computational Fluid Dynamics method and empirical data supported definitive conclusions on nozzle design parameter effects for l/d, skew angle, counterbore for varying injection pressure as well as provided an understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms involved to engender the resulting spray plume characteristics...|$|E
