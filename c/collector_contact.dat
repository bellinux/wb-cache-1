In this work, we investigated three different types of layout with the same emitter area AE = 0. 3 × 10. 16 µm 2, including single base and single <b>collector</b> <b>contact,</b> double base and single collector contacts, and double base and double collector contacts. Regarding the maximum output power and cutoff frequency (fT), the double bases and double collectors structure is the optimized layout, which provides a 6. 4 dBm maximum output power and a PAE of 40 % at 2. 4 GHz. It also leads to achieve a higher cutoff frequency due to the reduction of contact resistances. Index Terms- SiGe HBT, contact configuration, rf power, cutoff frequency...|$|E

40|$|The {{colloidal}} {{transport and}} deposition are important phenomena involved in many engineering problems. In the environmental engineering field {{the use of}} micro- and nano-scale zerovalent iron (M-NZVI) {{is one of the}} most promising technologies for groundwater remediation. Colloid deposition is normally studied from a micro scale point of view and the results are then implemented in macro scale models that are used to design field-scale applications. The single collector efficiency concept predicts particles deposition onto a single grain of a complex porous medium in terms of probability that an approaching particle would be retained on the solid grain. In literature, many different approaches and equations exist to predict it, but most of them fail under specific conditions (e. g. very small or very big particle size and very low fluid velocity) because they predict efficiency values exceeding unity. By analysing particle fluxes and deposition mechanisms and performing a mass balance on the entire domain, the traditional definition of efficiency was reformulated and a new definition was proposed. This new formulation is valid for a wide range of parameters and it never predicts efficiency values exceeding unity because of its formulation. Moreover a new traditional single <b>collector</b> <b>contact</b> efficiency correlation equation was formulated starting from the fitting of the mass flow on the collector.

When external noise is added, both the measured and simulated current-versus-time traces contain irregularly spaced spikes for particular applied voltages, which separate a regime of periodic current oscillations from a region of no current oscillations at all. In the voltage region without current oscillations, the electric field profile consist of a low-field domain near the emitter contact separated by a domain wall consisting of a charge accumulation layer from a high-field regime closer to the <b>collector</b> <b>contact.</b> With increasing noise amplitude, spontaneous chaotic current oscillations appear over a wider bias voltage range. For these bias voltages, the domain boundary between the two electric-field domains becomes unstable, and very small current or voltage fluctuations can trigger the domain boundary to move toward the collector and induce chaotic current spikes. The experimentally observed features are qualitatively very well reproduced by the simulations. Increased noise can consequently enhance chaotic current oscillations in semiconductor superlattices.

40|$|AC-driven double {{quantum dots}} (DQD), in the Coulomb {{blockade}} regime, {{have recently been}} proposed as both spin filters and spin pumps [1]. The periodic variation of the gate potentials allows for a net dc current through the device even with no dc voltage applied: if the system is driven at a frequency (or subharmonic) corresponding to the energy difference between two time-independent eigenstates, the electrons become completely delocalized between {{the left and right}} dot. Starting from this pumping principle, the current can be completely spinpolarized even if the contact leads are not spin polarized if the pumping process involves twoparticle states: Depending on the applied ac frequency, the double occupied singlet state of the emitter (left) quantum dot will come into resonance either with the double occupied singlet or triplet states of the right dot. Thus, one obtains different spin polarized pumping current peaks for the different resonant frequencies. In the present work, we have extended our previous model to include the effect of the ac potential on the tunneling between the emitter (<b>collector)</b> <b>contact</b> and the left (right) quantum dot, where photo-assisted tunneling (PAT) occurs.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{operation}} of infrared photodetectors based on van der Waals heterostructures with the multiple graphene layers (GLs) and n-type emitter and collector contacts. The operation of such GL infrared photodetectors (GLIPs) {{is associated with the}} photoassisted escape of electrons from the GLs into the continuum states in the conduction band of the barrier layers due to the interband photon absorption, the propagation of these electrons and the electrons injected from the emitter across the heterostructure and their collection by the <b>collector</b> <b>contact.</b> The space charge of the holes trapped in the GLs provides a relatively strong injection and large photoelectric gain. We calculate the GLIP responsivity and dark current detectivity as functions of the energy of incident infrared photons and the structural parameters. It is shown that both the periodic selective doping of the inter-GL barrier layers and the GL doping lead to a pronounced variation of the GLIP spectral characteristics, particularly near the interband absorption threshold, while the doping of GLs solely results in a substantial increase in the GLIP detectivity. The doping "engineering" opens wide opportunities for the optimization of GLIPs for operation in different parts of radiation spectrum from near infrared to terahertz.

40|$|Supercapacitor {{electrodes}} were fabricated {{by direct}} growth of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on Al current collectors via a {{chemical vapor deposition}} process {{in the presence of}} a spin-coated Co-Mo catalyst. A detailed study of the dependence of the CNT layer structure and thickness on growth time set the basis for the assessment of supercapacitors assembled with the CNTs/Al electrodes. As the main features of the layer growth evolution, an increase in the population of finer CNTs and a shift from a random entanglement to a rough vertical alignment of nanotubes were noted with proceeding growth. The growth time influence on the performance of supercapacitors was in fact apparent. Particularly, the specific capacitance of CNTs/Al electrodes in 0. 5 M K 2 SO 4 aqueous electrolyte increased from 35 to 80 F g- 1 as the CNT layer thickness varied from 20 to 60 mm, with a concurrent loss in rate capability (knee frequency from 1 kHz to 60 Hz). The latter was excellent in general, arguably due to both a fast ion transport through the interconnected CNT network and a negligible contribution of the active layer/current <b>collector</b> <b>contact</b> to the equivalent series resistance (0. 15 – 0. 22 mV g), a distinct advantage of the direct growth fabrication method.

The technological methods of manufacturing of indium antimonide nanowires arrays with high aspect ratio of the nanowire diameters to their length in the modified nanoporous anodic alumina matrixes were developed and tested. The microstructure and composition of the formed nanostructures were investigated. The electron microscopy allowed establishing that within each pore nanowires are formed with diameters of 35 nm and a length of 35 microns (equal to the matrix thickness).

40|$|Thermionic energy conversion, {{a process}} that allows direct {{transformation}} of thermal to electrical energy, presents a means of efficient electrical power generation as the hot and cold side of the corresponding heat engine are separated by a vacuum gap. Conversion efficiencies approaching those of the Carnot cycle are possible if material parameters of the active elements at the converter, i. e., electron emitter or cathode and collector or anode, are optimized for operation in the desired temperature range. These parameters can be defined through the law of Richardson–Dushman that quantifies {{the ability of a}} material to release an electron current at a certain temperature {{as a function of the}} emission barrier or work function and the emission or Richardson constant. Engineering materials to defined parameter values presents the key challenge in constructing practical thermionic converters. The elevated temperature regime of operation presents a constraint that eliminates most semiconductors and identifies diamond, a wide band-gap semiconductor, as a suitable thermionic material through its unique material properties. For its surface, a configuration can be established, the negative electron affinity, that shifts the vacuum level below the conduction band minimum eliminating the surface barrier for electron emission. In addition, its ability to accept impurities as donor states allows materials engineering to control the work function and the emission constant. Single-crystal diamond electrodes with nitrogen levels at 1. 7 [*]eV and phosphorus levels at 0. 6 [*]eV were prepared by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition where the work function was controlled from 2. 88 to 0. 67 [*]eV, one of the lowest thermionic work functions reported.
