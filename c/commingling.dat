5|$|A {{thorough}} stylistic {{analysis of}} the ornamentation of the monument, in particular of the figures within the circles of the Battle scene and the Scene of sacrifice reveal a surprising sensitivity to bronze {{on the part of}} Cairano, and considerable scope for reinterpretation and <b>commingling</b> of styles. This stemmed from a sensible response to {{the context in which the}} mausoleum was designed and implemented. Unprecedented in Brescia was the combination of bronze and stone, the former under the supervision of Bernardino delle Croci who certainly had a vast catalogue of references to ancient and contemporary works, all of which are cited in the major and minor rounds on the base. It is difficult to exclude Cairano from the influence of so much classicism, but the sole Scene of sacrifice attests to the sophistication of his chisel and the innovative combination of sculpture and bronzes around 1510, to which date much of the remaining lapidary apparatus can also be placed.|$|E
5|$|Glass {{can also}} be welded to metals and ceramics, {{although}} with metals the process is usually more adhesion {{to the surface of}} the metal rather than a <b>commingling</b> of the two materials. However, certain glasses will typically bond only to certain metals. For example, lead glass bonds readily to copper or molybdenum, but not to aluminum. Tungsten electrodes are often used in lighting but will not bond to quartz glass, so the tungsten is often wetted with molten borosilicate glass, which bonds to both tungsten and quartz. However, care must be taken to ensure that all materials have similar coefficients of thermal expansion to prevent cracking both when the object cools and when it is heated again. Special alloys are often used for this purpose, ensuring that the coefficients of expansion match, and sometimes thin, metallic coatings may be applied to a metal to create a good bond with the glass.|$|E
25|$|There were {{difficulties}} matching {{bones to}} one another due to the high amount of <b>commingling</b> of remains. Also, many bones in the body mature at different stages and therefore one individual may show maturation of some bones while still developing others. This made piecing together of entire individuals difficult and thus making inferences regarding health of individuals less distinct. Also, the sex of individuals was not clear since the entire skeletons {{were not able to}} be articulated.|$|E

25|$|In {{spite of}} the {{restrictions}} placed upon the Jews as dhimmis, life under Muslim rule was one of great opportunity and Jews flourished as they did not under the Christian Visigoths. Many Jews came to Iberia, seen as a land of tolerance and opportunity, from the Christian and Muslim worlds. Following initial Arab victories, and especially {{with the establishment of}} Umayyad rule by Abd al-Rahman I in 755, the native Jewish community was joined by Jews from the rest of Europe, as well as from Arab lands, from Morocco to Babylon. Jewish communities were enriched culturally, intellectually, and religiously by the <b>commingling</b> of these diverse Jewish traditions.|$|E
25|$|Though its exact {{parameters}} remain debatable, {{from the}} early 1970s {{to the present day}} the most salient literary movement has been postmodernism. Thomas Pynchon, a seminal practitioner of the form, drew in his work on modernist fixtures such as temporal distortion, unreliable narrators, and internal monologue and coupled them with distinctly postmodern techniques such as metafiction, ideogrammatic characterization, unrealistic names (Oedipa Maas, Benny Profane, etc.), absurdist plot elements and hyperbolic humor, deliberate use of anachronisms and archaisms, a strong focus on postcolonial themes, and a subversive <b>commingling</b> of high and low culture. In 1973, he published Gravity's Rainbow, a leading work in this genre, which won the National Book Award and was unanimously nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction that year. His other major works include his debut, V. (1963), The Crying of Lot 49 (1966), Mason & Dixon (1997), and Against the Day (2006).|$|E

The U.S. Department of Justice filed an involuntary bankruptcy petition on April 20, 1987, to collect the debt from Caucus Distributors Inc., Fusion Energy Foundation, and Campaigner Publications Inc. In a rare procedure, the companies were seized before the bankruptcy came to trial. Assistant U.S. Attorney S. David Schiller wrote in a brief that the debtors had a [...] "pattern of transferring or <b>commingling</b> substantial corporate assets to their members and other insiders for little or no consideration and for non-business purposes".

500|$|Though {{successful}} in San Francisco, Edwards decided {{to head for}} Boston and New York City to see if his career as an actor could benefit from appearances in the eastern United States. On June 29, 1878, somewhat fewer than 100 of his Bohemian friends gathered in the woods near Taylorville, California (present-day Samuel P. Taylor State Park), for a night-time send-off party in Edwards' honor. Bohemian Club historian Porter Garnett later wrote that {{the men at the}} [...] "nocturnal picnic" [...] were [...] "provided with blankets to keep them warm and a generous supply of liquor for the same purpose". Japanese lanterns were used for illumination and decoration. This festive gathering was repeated without Edwards by club members the next year, and every year thereafter, eventually evolving and expanding into the club's annual summer encampment at the Bohemian Grove, famous (or infamous) for the casual <b>commingling</b> of top politicians and powerful captains of industry in attendance.|$|E
500|$|After six or so {{weeks on}} the trail, the brigades reached Saint Paul. There the carters camped on the bluff above the town growing on the riverfront. Not all was harmonious. To the locals, the swarthy-complected carters {{up on the hill}} had a [...] "devil-may-care" [...] aspect, with their [...] "curious <b>commingling</b> of civilized {{garments}} and barbaric adornments". [...] One trader from the north called his host city [...] "a wretched little village" [...] where [...] "drinking whisky seems to occupy at least half the time of the worth citizens", while the rest were [...] "employed in cheating each other or imposing upon strangers." [...] The economic benefits of trade, and the separation of the carters' camp from the village below, may have helped keep relations civil. After about three weeks of trading, the [...] "wild" [...] carters from the north, now laden with goods, took their leave of the [...] "den of blackguards" [...] that was Saint Paul, returning to what they felt was a more civilized world. Their erstwhile hosts, on the other hand, thought their visitors were returning to an uncivilized and frozen wilderness.|$|E
500|$|Despite many {{explicit}} {{allusions to}} several world religions, Ingrid Reichel {{states that the}} novel is a book for “readers with humor, for reasoners (…), for darwinists, on no account for creationists, {{to a lesser extent}} for people of faith, but rather for atheists, … and fundamentalists drop out entirely”. Another aspect is identified by Karin Gayer when pinpointing the parallel evolution of the patriarchal hierarchy in the narrated society and the alluded social matriarchy, the first resembling chimpanzee communities and the second representing those of bonobos. In addition, she points out the strength of the women characters. She declares {{that at the time of}} the Australopithecus, neither chimpanzees nor bonobos existed, but [...] "the author is not interested in paleoanthropologic precisenesses—he is interested in mirroring our society, in exposing human behavior". She compares Costello with the alpha of a community of chimpanzees and a classical manager, and Akshaya with bonobo females and a modern-day career woman. With regard to these underlying comparisons, Gayer says, [...] "On another level we are struck by the permanent notional <b>commingling</b> of the simian and the human, a composition which leaves us pensive and asks the legitimate question where we, who consider ourselves sapiens in a double sense, should finally classify man." ...|$|E
