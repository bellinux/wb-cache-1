Using new survey data collected by the Department of Finance, we define firms as <b>credit</b> <b>rationed</b> or discouraged borrowers and link these constraints to employment and the propensity to invest. We find a negative and significant effect of SME credit constraints on employment for firms that are discouraged from applying for credit. We also find a negative effect of constraints on the probability of an SME investing. This effect is driven by firms who are <b>credit</b> <b>rationed</b> when seeking capacity expansion loans...|$|R

Contrary to the predictions of the existing theory, we find that better judicial enforcement increases the probability of being <b>credit</b> <b>rationed</b> and decreases loan size. Furthermore, we find that better judicial enforcement increases the probability of bankruptcy, a result that is consistent with lax screening effects. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{asymmetric}} {{information in this}} context means that borrowers and lenders have different amounts of the information in make borrowing and lending decisions.The topic was pioneered by Stiglitz and Weiss (1981).In their study, they showed that a competitive loan market suffers from the <b>credit</b> <b>rationing</b> problem.The <b>credit</b> <b>rationing</b> means that, among borrowers who appear to be identical, some get loans whereas others cannot not borrow although {{they are willing to}} get loans for the given interest rate.The information asymmetry in this economy can be described in the following way: Borrowers have different profitability and riskiness of their investments but lenders do not have enough information to sort out borrowers based on profitability and riskiness. Gale and Hellwig (1985)also studied the <b>credit</b> <b>rationing</b> problem and studied the optimal form of the debt contract between borrowers and lenders.Furthermore, Williamson (1987) showed that the <b>credit</b> <b>rationing</b> arises if lenders suffer from monitoring costs.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{tests the}} {{hypothesis}} that private transfers {{can be explained by}} the existence of self-enforcing family constitutions prescribing the minimum level at which a person in middle life should support her young children and elderly parents. The test is based on the effect of a binding <b>credit</b> <b>ration</b> on the probability of making a money transfer, which can be positive only in the presence of family constitutions. Allowing for the possible endogeneity of the <b>credit</b> <b>ration,</b> we find that rationing has a positive effect on the probability of giving money if the potential giver is under the age of retirement, but no significant effect if the person is already retired. This appears to reject {{the hypothesis that}} transfer behavior is the outcome of unfettered individual optimization on the part of either altruistic or exchange motivated agents, but not the one that individuals optimize subject to a self-enforcing family constitution.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the conditions for}} credit volume or borrower rationing in a competitive credit market in which the project characteristics are private information of the borrowers. There can only be <b>credit</b> volume <b>rationing</b> if the higher-risk credit applicants have a higher return {{in the event of}} a project success than the lower-risk credit applicants. Then the higher-risk borrowers are not rationed and obtain the social efficient credit volume. If the incentive compatibility constraint of the higher risk borrowers is binding, the lower-risk borrowers are <b>credit</b> volume <b>rationed</b> such that the constraint holds as an equation. If <b>credit</b> volume <b>rationing</b> is not sufficient to separate the borrower types, there is additionally a rationing of the low-risk borrowers. If the low-risk borrowers prefer a pooling to a separating contract, then there will not be a Cournot-Nash separating equilibrium, but a Wilson and a Grossmann pooling equilibrium...|$|R

This prompted a sister paper by the same authors, where they show that, on the one hand, <b>credit</b> <b>rationing</b> can occur even under symmetric information, and, on the other, that it might not imply a market failure. This severely limits the scope of government intervention.|$|E
50|$|Aggregate risk has {{potentially}} large {{implications for}} economic growth. For example, {{in the presence}} of <b>credit</b> <b>rationing,</b> aggregate risk can cause bank failures and hinder capital accumulation. Banks may respond to increases in profitability-threatening aggregate risk by raising standards for quality and quantity <b>credit</b> <b>rationing</b> to reduce monitoring costs; but the practice of lending to small numbers of borrowers reduces the diversification of bank portfolios (concentration risk) while also denying credit to some potentially productive firms or industries. As a result, capital accumulation and the overall productivity level of the economy can decline.|$|E

50|$|<b>Credit</b> <b>rationing</b> {{does not}} just caused from {{asymmetric}} information {{but also from}} limited enforcement in case of default. There are also costs used for law enforcement {{in order to get}} back the funds and in most of the case there is also possibility of not taking back at all if it was an unsecured loan. The problem of <b>credit</b> <b>rationing</b> arises most if the creditor does not have anything to provide as collateral. Even if he/she is a trustworthy person and would use the funds for good investment project and able to pay back his/her debt, the lender may not lend him/her so it leads to inefficient allocation of resources.|$|E
50|$|The more {{interesting}} case, that of equilibrium <b>credit</b> <b>rationing,</b> {{is the result}} of structural features of the market (in particular, adverse selection), and will characterise long run market outcomes (barring some technological breakthrough), and is analysed below.|$|E
50|$|As the {{probability}} of default is higher when debt is higher, there exists a level of lending that maximises expected return to the lender, and so the credit ceiling will depend on {{the probability}} of default. If desired lending is higher than the credit ceiling, some countries will not receive funds, and <b>credit</b> <b>rationing</b> will occur. This setting is reminiscent of Stiglitz and Weiss, as the interest rate has an incentive effect, and does not play the standard allocational role prices are supposed to play. As in that case, the allocation mechanism in Eaton and Gersovitz is <b>credit</b> <b>rationing,</b> which is not related to interest rate (the price of credit); at the going rate, countries want to borrow more but credit is denied.|$|E
40|$|In {{this essay}} a {{customer}} market model is constructed, where an entrepreneur-owned firm has two choice variables, namely the customer stock {{and the capital}} stock.

The model is solved numerically to yield steady state paths for the ratio of customers to capital, investments and price. A comparative statics analysis is carried out so as to find out how price and investments respond to exogenous shocks. The model is also tested empirically with data for the Swedish manufacturing sector. The results from the theoretical model point to a close relationship between price setting and investment decisions, which is then confirmed by the empirical investigation.

The state of the financial market, current lending conditions, and obstacles to credit flows on the supply and demand sides of the market are reviewed.

Thus, we challenge the conventional wisdom that Romanian farmers are <b>credit</b> <b>rationed</b> by lenders, and suggest that the limited frequency of credit transactions may be the result of economically rational decision making on the part of the farm households...|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{studies to}} employ implicit contracts models in capital markets see {{the existence of}} <b>credit</b> <b>rationing</b> {{as part of an}} equilibrium risk-sharing arrangement between a bank and its customer: the bank is risk neutral, and the borrower is risk averse, hence they gain from a long term relationship via shifting the interest rate risk from the borrower to the bank. If loans are negotiated in the spot market, then the borrower would be exposed to fluctuations in the spot market interest rates on her loan. Instead, if the borrower engages in an implicit contract with a bank, the bank can shield the borrower from fluctuations in the spot market by offering her a constant rate on the loan and in return for a higher average interest rate in the long run. However, if every bank charges a higher interest rate than the average rate in the spot market, then there would be <b>credit</b> <b>rationing.</b> This approach hinges on the assumption that agents (bank and the borrower) have different attitudes towards risk. However, more recent studies of capital markets do not rely on different attitudes towards risk, instead they focus on asymmetric information and the default risk in the capital markets. Also, implicit contracts have been playing an important role in explaining <b>credit</b> <b>rationing</b> under asymmetric information.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Credit</b> <b>rationing</b> is the {{limiting}} by lenders {{of the supply}} of additional credit to borrowers who demand funds, even if the latter {{are willing to pay}} higher interest rates. It is an example of market imperfection, or market failure, as the price mechanism fails to bring about equilibrium in the market. It {{should not be confused with}} cases where credit is simply [...] "too expensive" [...] for some borrowers, that is, situations where the interest rate is deemed too high. With <b>credit</b> <b>rationing,</b> the borrower would like to acquire the funds at the current rates, and the imperfection is the absence of equilibrium in spite of willing borrowers. In other words, at the prevailing market interest rate, demand exceeds supply, but lenders are not willing to either loan more funds, or raise the interest rate charged, as they are already maximising profits.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} corporate taxes on the capital structure {{in a country where}} bank financing is the main external financing source. It is found that the existence of a debt tax shield and provisions for tax loss carry-forwards has an important impact on the capital structure of the firm. These results differ from the general result in the literature that taxes do not matter for the capital structure decision. The main difference is that these results are obtained from a bank based financing system where asymmetric information and agency problems are solved differently than under a market-based system where most of the general results from the literature are obtained. Consistent with this, the pecking order theory of capital structure is rejected. Finally, it is found that small firms may be <b>credit</b> <b>rationed</b> by the banks...|$|R

40|$|This work {{presents}} an equilibrium model of diversification through merger formation.

Within this setting, the effects on merger activity of different kinds of capital tightening are studied. In particular, credit crunches, collateral squeezes and savings squeezes are analyzed. The main results are that diversifying merger activity increases during times of economic expansion and is positively related to aggregate economic activity, business incorporations and easing of access to credit (both interest and non-interest terms of credit). Furthermore, the model offers a rationale for diversification that is immune to the diversification neutrality result and furthermore, explains why diversified companies trade at a discount relative to their non-diversified counterparts.

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{evidence of}} multiple bank lending relationships in credit markets suggests that ﬁrms {{are interested in}} setting up a diversity of banking links. However, {{it is hard to}} know from the empirical data whether a ﬁrm’s observed number of lenders is symptomatic of ﬁnancial constraints or rather a well-designed strategy. We design an experimental credit to analyze the determinants of multiple bank lending relationships, both from the demand and the supply side. Our results show that borrowers prefer multiple lending when they are <b>credit</b> <b>rationed</b> and unable to stabilize their lending source, whatever their risk level. Moreover, rationed borrowers are less likely to repay and display a higher tendency to switch between lenders. At the same time, we observe that the determinants of lending change according to the type of information available on the loan applicants. If their quality is not observable, only credit history and relationship length matter, while the borrowers’ behavior clearly impacts the lending decision if information is complete. Our ﬁndings support the view that the number of banking relationships is mainly determined by the supply side...|$|R
