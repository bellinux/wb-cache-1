5|$|Belgium {{continued}} to rule Rwanda as a UN Trust Territory after World War II, with {{a mandate to}} oversee its eventual independence. The economic landscape had changed considerably during the war; a cash economy grew, {{and with it the}} demand for labourers in the Congolese mines of Katanga and the coffee and sugar plantations of Uganda. There was a simultaneous shift in the Catholic Church; prominent figures in the early Rwandan church, who were from a wealthy and conservative background (such as Léon-Paul <b>Classe),</b> were replaced by younger clergy of working-class origin. Of these, a greater proportion were Flemish rather than Walloon Belgians and sympathised with the plight of the Hutu. Economic conditions and the seminary education provided by the church gave the Hutu a social mobility not previously possible, allowing the development of an elite group of Hutu leaders and intellectuals. This group, consisting of Hutu from the precolonial Kingdom of Rwanda, was joined by prominent citizens of kingdoms acquired during colonialism (including the Kiga).|$|E

Some producers make a (lesser) second or third wine that they also mark cru <b>classé</b> de Provence. Also, no geographic limitation is implied, so as the producers buy and sell new plots of land, sometimes far from the original winery, the wines from those vineyards become cru <b>classé.</b> In addition, the list cannot be changed, no new wineries can be added and a winery cannot lose the cru <b>classé</b> status. The 18 lucky owners just benefit from the classification, no matter how good the wine is.|$|E

25|$|Education is {{compulsory}} {{from the}} age of 7 to 13. Pre-school education for children between three and six years of age is optional and in its early stages. There are five levels of education: pre-school, elemental and complementary basic education, general and complementary secondary education, general secondary education, technical and professional teaching, and higher education (university and non-universities). Basic education is under reform, and now forms a single cycle, comprising 6 years of education. Secondary education is widely available and there are two cycles (7th to 9th <b>classe</b> and 10th to 11th <b>classe).</b> Professional education in public institutions is nonoperational, however private school offerings opened, including the Centro de Formação São João Bosco (since 2004) and the Centro de Formação Luís Inácio Lula da Silva (since 2011).|$|E

Although he had an extremely busy managerial job, he still found time to prepare three mathematical manuscripts, which he submitted to the Première <b>Classe</b> (First Class) of the Institut de France.

500|$|The lily {{appears in}} ancient {{literature}} associated with both sovereignty and virginal innocence, and is mentioned {{on a number}} of occasions in the Bible, such as the description in Solomon's Song of Songs (2, 1–2) [...] "I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys. Like a lily among thorns is my darling among the young women" [...] or the Gospel of Mathew (6, 28) [...] "Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin" [...] to represent beauty. Artistic representations can be found as far back as frescos from the second century BC, at Amnisos and Knossos. Early Christian churches, such as that of the Basilica of Sant' Apollinare in <b>Classe</b> were sometimes decorated with lilies. While predominantly depicted as white, those seen at Akrotiri are red lilies. The white lily has long been seen as a symbol of purity, coming to be associated with the Virgin Mary in the Middle Ages, from which came the name ‘Madonna lily’ (Lilium candidum). A well-known example is Leonardo da Vinci's Annunciation (1472–1475) in which the archangel Gabriel bears a Madonna lily. Other symbolic meanings include glory, love and birth.|$|E
