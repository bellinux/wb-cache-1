40|$|The goal of {{treatment}} planning for cancer radiation therapy is to adequately treat the patient's tumor volume while minimizing dose {{to the surrounding}} healthy tissue. In the case of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), this is accomplished by using complex computer models to calculate the dose to a given volume. These volumes and their resolution of defined by the <b>calculation</b> <b>grid,</b> which defines the space where the dose calculation models are applied and the resolution of that space. The resolution {{is determined by the}} size of the voxels (a 3 -D pixel). IMRT procedures require a great deal of accuracy and much work has been done at Ball Memorial Hospital (BMH) to verify the accuracy of these treatments.

[2] <b>Calculation</b> <b>grid</b> defined in these documents was created {{at a time of}} less powerful computers and less precise measuring technology. Distance between two adjacent calculating points may be even 3 m, depending on the geometry of the road. This arrangement is too sparse {{in view of the fact}} that presently used computers can cope with much more denser grids in a shorter operation time and the measurement can be performed by luminance analyzers with more accuracy as well. Between the results of the calculation with different grid densities of calculation points there can be significant differences. This fact can be influenced by new optical systems and some LED luminaires which, as it was found out by measurements, may contain various local extremes in the LIDC. When calculating the performance parameters of public lighting with given grid density these extremes may fall between calculation points and thus they are not included in the calculation.

Such errors have been quantitatively reported for a fixed multifield intensity-modulated radiation therapy using traditional linear accelerators. The {{aim of this study}} is to quantify the influence of the <b>calculation</b> <b>grid</b> size on the dose distribution in TomoTherapy. This study used ten treatment plans for prostate cancer. The final dose calculation was performed with “fine” (2. 73 mm) and “normal” (5. 46 mm) grid sizes. The dose distributions were compared from different points of view: the dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters for planning target volume (PTV) and organ at risk (OAR), the various indices, and dose differences. The DVH parameters were used Dmax, D 2 %, D 2 cc, Dmean, D 95 %, D 98 %, and Dmin for PTV and Dmax, D 2 %, and D 2 cc for OARs. The various indices used were homogeneity index and equivalent uniform dose for plan evaluation. Almost all of DVH parameters for the “fine” calculations tended to be higher than those for the “normal” calculations. The largest difference of DVH parameters for PTV was Dmax and that for OARs was rectal D 2 cc. The mean difference of Dmax was 3. 5 %, and the rectal D 2 cc was increased up to 6 % at the maximum and 2. 9 % on average. The mean difference of D 95 % for PTV was the smallest among the differences of the other DVH parameters. For each index, whether there was a significant difference between the two grid sizes was determined through a paired t-test. There were significant differences for most of the indices. The dose difference between the “fine” and “normal” calculations was evaluated. Some points around high-dose regions had differences exceeding 5 % of the prescription dose. The influence of the <b>calculation</b> <b>grid</b> size in TomoTherapy is smaller than traditional linear accelerators. However, there was a significant difference.

Indeed, there was some difficulty in dealing with very complex internal geometries, consequently “regular” configurations were chosen. Complications related to the internal geometry are due to the difficulty in creating an acceptable computational grid with the automatic methods such as those used. Each simulation required checking results in a “retroactive” way. The controlled variables are the contact surface temperature and the wall y+. The former should fall in a neighbourhood of the contact temperature sets during the setup stage to provide the power absorbed by the engine, as shown by Eq. (2).
