In this way, the NC system, for example, NC machining tool, can realize any kind of complex and powerful cutting or manufacturing at higher maching speed than other machines. With the higher power and speed servomotor or servo system expansiving, this system will fulfill working task with higher productivity and lower cost...|$|R
