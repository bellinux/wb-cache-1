50|$|As is {{characteristic}} with {{the rivers and}} streams in the comarque, the River Pinet is a wash, that is, a stream bed that is dry {{during the summer months}} and which carries abundant water following the typical heavy rains known as <b>cold</b> <b>drop</b> which fall in autumn and spring.|$|E
50|$|The average {{rainfall}} is 277 mm per year. The <b>cold</b> <b>drop</b> {{means that}} September and October are the wettest months. Rarely, the rainfall can be torrential, reaching over 100 mm in a 24-hour period, leading to severe flooding. Because of this irregularity, only 35 rainy days are observed on average per year, {{and the annual}} number of sunshine hours is 2,953.|$|E

50|$|The <b>cold</b> <b>drop</b> (gota fría) is {{a weather}} {{phenomenon}} often {{occurring in the}} Spanish autumn. It is experienced particularly along the western Mediterranean and as such, most frequently affects {{the east coast of}} Spain. It is a closed upper-level low which has become completely displaced (cut off) from basic westerly current, and moves independently of that current. Cutoff lows may remain nearly stationary for days, or on occasion may move westward opposite to the prevailing flow aloft (i.e., retrogression). The term is also used to describe the meteorological phenomenon associated. In Spain, it appears when a front of very cold polar air, a jet stream, advances slowly over Western Europe, at high altitude (normally 5-9 km or 3-5.5 mi).|$|E

40|$|The Santa Irene flood, {{at the end}} of October 1982, is one of {{the most}} {{dramatically}} and widely reported flood events in Spain. Its renown is mainly attributable to the collapse of the Tous dam, but its main message is to be the paradigm of the incidence of the maritime/littoral weather and its temporal sea-level rise on the coastal plains inland floods. The Santa Irene flood was attributable to a meteorological phenomenon known as gota fría (<b>cold</b> <b>drop),</b> a relatively frequent and intense rainy phenomenon on the Iberian Peninsula, particularly on the Spanish E to SE inlands and coasts. There are some circumstances that can easily come together to unleash the <b>cold</b> <b>drop</b> there: cold and dry polar air masses coming onto the whole Iberian Peninsula and the north of Africa, high sea-water temperatures, and low atmospheric pressure (cyclone) areas in the western Mediterranean basin; these circumstances are quite common during the autumn and, as it happens, in other places around the world (E/SE Africa). Their occurrence, however, shows a great space-temporal variability (in a similar way to hurricanes on Caribbean and western North Atlantic areas or also in a similar way to typhoons). In fact, all of these are equivalent, although different, phenomena, able to have a different magnitude each time. This paper describes the results of a detailed analysis and reflection about this <b>cold</b> <b>drop</b> phenomenon as a whole, on the generation of its rains, and on the different natures and consequences of its flood. This paper also explains the ways in which the nearby maritime weather and the consequential sea level govern floods on different zones of any hydrographical basin. The Santa Irene case can be considered as a paradigm to explain the influence of nearby maritime climatic conditions on flooding phenomena not only in coastal but also in upward inland areas...|$|E

40|$|We {{present results}} from moist {{convection}} {{in a mixture}} of pressurized sulfur hexa-flouride (liquid and vapor) and helium (gas) to model the wet and dry components of the earth's atmosphere. To allow for homogeneous nucleation, we operate the experiment close to critical conditions. We report on the nucleation of microdroplets in the wake of large <b>cold</b> liquid <b>drops</b> falling through the supersaturated atmosphere and show that the homogeneous nucleation is caused by isobaric cooling of the saturated sulfur hexaflouride vapor. Our results carry over to atmospheric clouds: falling hail and <b>cold</b> rain <b>drops</b> may enhance the heterogeneous nucleation of microdroplets in their wake under supersaturated atmospheric conditions. We also observed that under appropriate conditions settling microdroplets form a rather stable horizontal cloud layer, which separates regions of super and sub critical saturation.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to develop and validate a numerical model to study wetting during the impact of millimeter-size drops on a flat, smooth, solid substrate under isothermal or non-isothermal conditions. A finite-element modeling is used to simulate the transient fluid dynamics and heat transfer, considering Laplace forces on the liquid-gas boundary. The Lagrangian scheme allows a very precise tracking of the free surface deformation. In this work, the numerical model is extended to account for a temperature-dependent viscosity and for dynamic wetting at the contact line. Numerical results are presented to study {{the influence of the}} kinetic wetting parameter on the wetting incipience and behavior. Our results show the influence of wetting on the spreading and the transient drop shape. Also, numerical results are compared with high-speed visualization, for cases of isothermal and non-isothermal impact. Matching between simulations and high-speed visualization allows the determination {{of the value of the}} kinetic wetting parameter. Our main finding is that warm drops spread more than <b>cold</b> <b>drops</b> because of a reduction of viscous forces, and not because of an increase of wetting...|$|R
