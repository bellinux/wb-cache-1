40|$|ABSTRACT: The isthmo-optic {{nucleus of}} the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>system</b> in birds {{receives}} primarily input from the ipsilateral tectum and projects to the contralateral retina. The present study using brain slices and microiontophoresis shows that synaptic trans-mission from the tectum to the centrifugal nucleus in pigeons is excitatory. About 75 % of tecto-isthmo-optic fibers are glutama-tergic, mediated by a-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazole propionic acid but not N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptors, and 25 % of others may use nitric oxide as a transmitter or modula-tor. On the other hand, about 60 % of isthmo-optic cells receive glutamatergic afferents, 20 % receive nitric oxidergic afferents, and 20 % of others receive both glutamatergic and nitric oxider-gic afferents from the tectum. In the last group, {{it is more likely}} that both glutamate and nitric oxide may co-release from the same tecto-isthmo-optic terminals.

40|$|We {{present an}} all-thermoplastic {{integrated}} sample-to-answer centrifugal microfluidic Lab-on-Disc system (LoD) for nucleic acid analysis. The proposed CD system and engineered platform were employed {{for analysis of}} Bacillus atrophaeus subsp. globigii spores. The complete assay comprised cellular lysis, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, amplicon digestion, and microarray hybridization on a plastic support. The fluidic robustness and operating efficiency of the assay were ensured through analytical optimization of microfluidic tools enabling beneficial implementation of capillary valves and accurate control of all flow timing procedures. The assay reliability was further improved {{through the development of}} two novel microfluidic strategies for reagents mixing and flow delay on the CD platform. In order {{to bridge the gap between}} the proof-of-concept LoD and production prototype demonstration, low-cost thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) was selected as the material for CD fabrication and assembly, allowing the use of both, high quality hot-embossing and injection molding processes. Additionally, the low-temperature and pressure-free assembly and bonding properties of TPE material offer a pertinent solution for simple and efficient loading and storage of reagents and other on-board components. This feature was demonstrated through integration and conditioning of microbeads, magnetic discs, dried DNA buffer reagents and spotted DNA array inserts. Furthermore, all microfluidic functions and plastic parts were designed according to the current injection mold-making knowledge for industrialization purposes. Therefore, the current work highlights a seamless strategy that promotes a feasible path for the transfer from prototype toward realistic industrialization.

40|$|This paper {{shows the}} results of one deepened {{investigation}} on the technical legislation which to make reference for the olive oil wastes disposal in the UE Countries, starting from the Community directives related to the disposal of the industrial and agricultural waters, {{as well as of}} the wastes. Aim of the search has been that to furnish solutions to the problem of the spreading in field of such wastes really enjoyable by the oil industry and the olive growing. In fact, among the olive oil Countries, Italy is the only one in which the agronomic use of the olive oil mill wastes (omw) is permitted through a uniform spreading on the agrarian soil; the quantities to annually be distributed don't owe to be superior to 80 m 3 /ha for the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>system</b> mills and 50 m 3 /ha for those with pressure system. Moreover, specific dimensional criterions have been defined for tank-trucks destined to the controlled distribution in olive-grove of the omw, according by the law, as well as the technical-agronomic parameters related to the time of distribution. The Authors have designed a tank-truck prototype to such aim. The machine has been optimized by tests in olive-groves, through which the systems of distribution, transversal and longitudinal have been tested. Through such systems (software controlled) it is possible, in any operational condition, to guarantee a spreading of the waste, uniform on the whole interested surface according by law. This prerogative constitutes the main element of these agricultural machines for its influence on the work quality (performance); in fact, if the tank-truck offers enough guarantees of high performances, it is possible to exalt its agronomic efficiency and to plan the spreading, not as an economic solution relatively for the wastes disposal, but rather as a productive and ecological solution to furnish to the soil and to the crops a suitable reinstate some nutrients...|$|E
40|$|The {{experiment}} proposed aims {{to evidence}} and {{to measure the}} deflection of light rays induced by the source speed upon emission, and to discern it from the aberration of light rays induced by the observer speed. The method stands in creating a speed asymmetry between that of the source {{and that of the}} observer, and relies on the centrifugation of a light source at ultrahigh speed. When source and observer have the same speed, such as when being both on the same inertial system, the deflection and the aberration compensate and their net effect is null. So, in order to circumscribe the odds of inertial systems and to isolate these speed-induced effects it has instead been appealed to a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>system,</b> since it allows infringing symmetry between the source and the observer speeds. Three cases are considered. (a) Centrifugation of the source fixed {{at one end of the}} rotor arm, while the detector is fixed on the rotor axis. This configuration of the experiment aims to unveil that due to the peripheral speed of the source the beam is deflected forward, so it impinges on the centric detector slightly shifted from its position when the system was not rotating. (b) The positions of the source and the detector are interchanged, so the source peripheral speed is then null and thus no speed-induced deflection ensues, but due to the observer peripheral speed there is a speed-induced aberration since during the beam time-of-flight the detector has slightly moved side-way. However, this time the spot shifts in opposite direction and hence the effect of centrifugation is not reciprocal. (c) The source and the detector are fixed at the two ends of the rotor arms. In this case the beam deflection and aberration add, since their speed vectors have opposite directions and each shift of the spot on the detector is double since the time-of-flight is double.

The assessment consists of first developing a one-dimensional meanline model for estimating performance of <b>centrifugal</b> compressor <b>system</b> followed by the formulation of a control framework incorporating the meanline model. Performance estimate of a representative <b>centrifugal</b> compressor <b>system</b> with adjustable IGV angle, VDV angle and impeller speed using the meanline model is in accord with available test data. The impeller performance estimate based on the meanline model is also in accord with computed results from Reynolds Average Navier-Stokes Equations. The simple control framework {{can be used to}} optimize on the fly the compressor operation to meet a specific mission requirement by selecting an appropriate combination of impeller speed, IGV and VDV angle settings. Desirable flow configurations with the required performance in response to specified operating needs have been obtained to serve as illustrations on the practical utility of the control framework. Results provide guidelines and attributes of compressor for achieving the required performance and operation at the system level through prioritizing the actuation of the adjustable parameters; for instance impeller speed would provide a high level of leverage to affect the compressor performance on an effective basis and that the IGV angle should be confined to a specified range. While the results have not been assessed in an experimental setting, they are used to design and plan an experimental program for evaluating the proposed simple multi-parameter control strategy. Flexibility have been incorporated into the formulation to allow the refinement and updating of the model for improved accuracy and fidelity. Sebastien Mannai. Thesis: S.
