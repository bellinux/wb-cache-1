This new service by the infrastructure institutions library and computing center helps disseminate the idea of electronic publishing as a new tool for academic work. DINI – the Deutsche Initiative für Netzwerkinformation (German Initiative for Networked Information) – supports this development to reach {{a higher level of}} scientific and scholarly communication nationwide and internationally. To reach this goal it is necessary to network {{document and}} publication repositories. A network of local publications would complement the dominant (commercial) publications through publishing houses. This network may therefore also function as a regulating body against the monopolistic tendencies in scholarly publishing. The German Science Council and the Conference of University Rectors in Germany call for the installation of document and publication repositories, and funding institutions such as the Ministry for Science and Technology (Bundesministerium für Forschung und Bildung) and the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) support (and fund) this. It is deemed important to develop this according to international standards and to use proven technology. Taking the DINI publication “Electronic Publishing in Higher Education” (March 2002), that was published as a first guideline, as a starting point, this publications aims at three targets: - give {{a detailed description of the}} requirements of a <b>certified</b> <b>document</b> and publication repository, - highlight directions of development in the areas of configuration of repositories and of information exchange through theses repositories, - offer a certificate visible to both users and operators to certify the adherence to defined standards and recommendations by this repository. By issuing this certificate, DINI for the first time introduces a quality control for document and publication repositories. A set of minimum requirements of a repository and its operator mandatory for modern scholarly communication is formulated. At the same time DINI makes recommendations highlighting foreseeable developments that might turn into future requirements.

It is important to develop these services according to international standards and on the basis of proven technologies. It is only in this manner that the worldwide visibility and impact of the scholarly work of the individual scientist and scholar, {{as well as that of}} an entire university, can be improved. This second edition of the ‘DINI-Certificate Document and Publication Services’ includes current international developments, describes how Document and Publication Services support the open-access publication of scholarly documents, and shows how as Institutional Repositories they can position themselves in their respective institutions, especially with regard to supporting scholars and scientists to make pre and post prints of their documents available that have already been published by publishing houses – free of time or space constraints. The DINI-Certificate 2007 aims for the following: *Provide a detailed description of the requirements of <b>certified</b> <b>Document</b> and Publication Services, *Position Document and Publication Services as an Institutional Repository, *Highlight development directions in the areas of developing services and of information exchange, *Offer a visible reference to both users and providers to certify the adherence to defined standards and recommendations by the respective Document and Publication Services. By issuing this certificate, DINI offers a quality control for Document and Publication Services. A set of mandatory minimum requirements of a service and its provider must be attained, prior to the award of the DINI Certificate. Fulfilling these requirements is essential in order to allow modern scholarly communication. At the same time, DINI makes recommendations with regard to foreseeable developments that might become future requirements. A working group within DINI verifies the criteria for the DINI Certificate against international standards and developments and updates them accordingly. For this reason, the certificate carries a date stamp (year of version). In this second version of the DINI Certificate the name of the certificate has been changed from ‘Document and Publication Repositories’ to ‘Document and Publication Services’, to clarify that it not only certificates a server, but also serverbased services...|$|E
