40|$|Chemical {{investigation}} of the 90 % acetone extract of the branches and leaves of Sabina gaussenii led to the isolation of two new <b>cinnamyl</b> <b>isovalerate</b> derivatives (1 – 2) and eighteen known compounds (3 – 20). Their structures were determined mainly by means of MS, 1 D- and 2 D-NMR data, {{and this is the}} first time these compounds have been reported from this plant. The biological activity test results indicated that the 90 % acetone extract showed cytotoxicity against the human lung adenocarcinoma (A 549) cell line (IC 50 = 0. 98 ± 0. 1 μg/mL), compound 6 showed cytotoxicities against human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) (IC 50 = 0. 4 ± 0. 1 μM) and human gastric carcinoma (BGC- 823) (IC 50 = 0. 9 ± 0. 2 μM) cancer cell lines, and compound 19 showed cytotoxicities against HeLa (IC 50 = 1. 5 ± 0. 4 μM), BGC- 823 (IC 50 = 7. 0 ± 0. 8 μM), and A 549 (IC 50 = 10. 6 ± 1. 5 μM) cancer cell lines...|$|E
