Ammunition and food were running short, and as no vehicles <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> the track, fresh supplies had to be sent up to Es Salt during the night of 1/2 May on about 200 donkeys. They were collected at Ghoraniyeh bridgehead in the evening, loaded with ammunition and stores and sent off in charge of a subaltern of the gunners. They reached Es Salt in the morning, delivered their supplies to Es Salt on the plateau and returned safely to Ghoraniyeh; a distance of [...] through appallingly rugged and precipitous country.|$|E

2500|$|Johnson {{was often}} seen as a wildly ambitious, tireless, and {{imposing}} figure who was ruthlessly effective at getting legislation passed. He worked 18- to 20-hour days without break and was apparently absent of any leisure activities. [...] "There was no more powerful majority leader in American history," [...] biographer Robert Dallek writes. Dallek stated that Johnson had biographies on all the Senators, knew what their ambitions, hopes, and tastes were {{and used it to}} his advantage in securing votes. Another Johnson biographer noted, [...] "He <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> every day and learn what their fears, their desires, their wishes, their wants were and he could then manipulate, dominate, persuade and cajole them." [...] At [...] tall, Johnson had his own particular brand of persuasion, known as [...] "The Johnson Treatment". A contemporary writes, [...] "It was an incredible blend of badgering, cajolery, reminders of past favors, promises of future favors, predictions of gloom if something doesn't happen. When that man started to work on you, all of a sudden, you just felt that you were standing under a waterfall and the stuff was pouring on you." ...|$|E

[...] Because they were apprehensive about the powerful armies that Tan and Wang Hong had, they summoned Tan and Wang {{to the capital}} and then informed them of the plot.

Before Emperor Shao <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> from bed in the morning, the soldiers were already in his bedchamber, {{and he made a}} futile attempt to resist, but was captured. He was sent back to his old palace. The officials then, in the name of Emperor Shao's mother Empress Dowager Zhang, declared Emperor Shao's faults and demoted him to Prince of Yingyang, offering the throne to his younger brother Liu Yilong the Prince of Yidu instead. [...] (Xu's associate Cheng Daohui (程道惠) had initially urged that Xu offer the throne to an even younger brother, Liu Yigong (劉義恭) the Prince of Jiangxia, to control power longer, but Xu and Fu believed Liu Yilong to be capable and therefore decided on him.) [...] Xu remained at Jiankang, while Fu went to Liu Yilong's post at Jing Province (荊州, modern Hubei) to welcome him.|$|E

[...] Xu and Fu subsequently assassinated both Emperor Shao and Liu Yizhen, and it is unclear whether Xie participated in this decision. [...] In order to counteract imperial authority, prior to Liu Yilong's arrival, made Xie the governor of Jing Province (荊州, modern Hubei) to replace Liu Yilong, with the intent that Xie and Tan can counteract against the emperor should the emperor act against them. [...] Liu Yilong subsequently, after some deliberation, accepted the throne (as Emperor Wen).|$|E

2500|$|As {{in other}} Nevada brothels, {{customers}} were buzzed {{in through a}} gate. Once in, they chose a woman from a lineup in a lobby, and negotiated prices and services in the woman's room.

The women was require to escort the customer from her room to the door. Some men would relax in the bar or on sofas talking to the girls. In time the men would be rested for [...] "round two." [...] Many men had favorites or wanted variety. They could be with as many women as they could afford. The fantasy of two and three women simultaneously was common. Another frequent fantasy was of an older and younger prostitute being intimate with the customer and each other; he pretended they were mother and daughter.|$|E
