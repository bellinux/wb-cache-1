Line 2 did not operate on Sundays. 11 June 1983 was the last day with line 2 in service. The cities newest depot was razed, and Dalsenget had all depot service from 2 May 1983.

50|$|One of {{his most}} {{outrageous}} stunts was to close down the Macau-Taipa Bridge for some hours to allow filming of a crucial scene in the movie.

However, Wan wanted the scene to be shot anyway so he <b>closed</b> <b>traffic</b> {{from both sides of}} the bridge without any warning and the scene was filmed in this manner. Traffic to and from Macau was, because of this, halted for around two hours. No police intervention was made or any other measures by the Macau Government were taken to reopen the bridge to normal traffic flow on what was then the only link between the Macau mainland and Taipa-Coloane.|$|E

5000|$|The {{services}} originally {{opened in}} 1974 with two sites, one {{each side of}} the motorway (the traditional layout of a British service station).

The former Westbound site is now owned by a developer. in the mid-1980s bands travelling between Manchester and Liverpool often stopped at the services and the site became an autograph hunters' hub - regular stoppers were Tears for Fears, Yazoo and Strut Trivia.

Likewise, military installations such as NAS Pensacola, Whiting Field, Eglin AFB, Hurlburt Field and Tyndall AFB were all evacuated days before the storm.

50|$|The Oakham canal {{had never}} been so profitable, paying {{dividends}} of around 3.8 per cent, and lack of water during the dry summer of 1844 resulted in it closing for five months. When the Midland Railway sought to build their Syston and Peterborough Railway, the Oakham company negotiated, and the railway bought the canal on 29 October 1847, with a view to closing it and using part of the bed for their line. The effect on the Melton Mowbray Navigation was dramatic. 1847 was its best year, for it carried 68,896 tons, of which 39,451 proceeded on to the Oakham canal. With the Oakham <b>closed,</b> <b>traffic</b> for the following year was less than half, at 30,879 tons, and had dropped to just 13,301 tons in 1850. Income fell even faster, from £4,830 in 1847 to £415 in 1849. The Canal company attempted to sell the waterway to the Loughborough Navigation in the 1860s, and then to the Midland Railway Company, but neither were interested. It struggled on until closure on 1 August 1877.|$|E
40|$|Study of low-time general {{aviation}} pilots, who, {{in a series}} of spot landings, were suddenly deprived of binocular vision by patching either eye on the downwind leg of a standard, <b>closed</b> <b>traffic</b> pattern. Data collected during these landings were compared with control data from landings flown with normal vision during the same flight. The sequence of patching and the mix of control and monocular landings were randomized to minimize the effect of learning. No decrease in performance was observed during landings with vision restricted to one eye, in fact, performance improved. This observation is reported at a high level of confidence (p less than 0. 001). These findings confirm the previous work of Lewis and Krier and have important implications with regard to aeromedical certification standards...|$|E

40|$|This report {{includes}} {{an inventory of}} the available literature about traffic behaviour exhibited during road works. A selection has also been constructed of injury accidents which, according to the 1990 - 1996 road accident registration, were classified as being associated with road works. The fatal accidents of 1996 were studied as based on {{a description of the}} circumstances, a situation sketch, and a number of background characteristics thought to be relevant. The injury accidents from the 1993 - 1996 period in which road workers were victims were studied in detail as based on the original registration forms for the purpose of deriving a number of accident scenarios from this. In The Netherlands, about 1, 000 victims are involved in accidents that take place within the vicinity of road works. Accidents involving road workers occur relatively frequently on a <b>closed</b> <b>traffic</b> lane or closed road section, on an emergency lane, next to a guard rail, on a shoulder or on a merge lane. About 60 % of all the investigated injury accidents in which persons who were carrying out work became victims, occurred within urban areas. It is remarkable that the majority (two-thirds) of accidents in the group classified as 'road workers' took place, on the contrary, in rural areas...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Civil EngineeringSunanda DissanayakeIn the United States, {{approximately}} 1, 100 {{people die}} and 40, 000 people are injured annually {{as a result}} of motor vehicle crashes in work zones. These numbers may be a result of interruption to regular traffic flow caused by <b>closed</b> <b>traffic</b> lanes, poor traffic management within work zones, general misunderstanding of problems associated with work zones, or improper usage of traffic control devices. In regard to safety of work zones, this study was conducted to identify characteristics and risk factors associated with work zone crashes in Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and Wisconsin, states currently included in the Smart Work Zone Deployment Initiative (SWZDI) region. The study was conducted in two stages. In the first stage, characteristics and contributory causes related to work zone crashes such as environmental conditions, vehicles, crashes, drivers, and roadways were analyzed for the five states for the period 2002 - 2006. An analysis of percentage-wise distributions was carried out for each variable based on different conditions. Results showed that most of the work zone crashes occurred under clear environmental conditions as during daylight, no adverse weather, etc. Multiple-vehicle crashes were more predominant than single-vehicle crashes in work zone crashes. Primary driver-contributing factors of work zone crashes were inattentive driving, following too close for conditions, failure to yield right of way, driving too fast for conditions, and exceeding posted speed limits within work zones. A test of independency was performed to find the relation between crash severity and other work zone variables for the combined states. In the second stage, a statistical model was developed to identify risk factors associated with work zone crashes. In order to predict injury severity of work zone crashes, an ordered probit model analysis was carried out using the Iowa work zone crash database. According to findings of the severity model, work zone crashes involving trucks, light duty vehicles, vehicles following too close, sideswipe collisions of same-direction vehicles, nondeployment of airbags, and driver age are some of the contributing factors towards more severe crashes...|$|E
