40|$|A helical <b>cable</b> car <b>grip</b> to {{minimize}} high maintenance costs of San Francisco's cable car operation is presented. The grip establishes a rolling {{contact between the}} <b>cable</b> and <b>grip</b> to reduce sliding friction and associated cable wear. The design, development, and testing of the helical <b>cable</b> car <b>grip</b> are described...|$|R
50|$|While the <b>cable</b> <b>grips</b> {{used in the}} {{original}} cable railways were manually operated, requiring considerable skill and strength, modern <b>cable</b> <b>grips</b> tend to be automatic. Given that the cable runs at a relatively constant speed, accelerating the vehicle to match {{the speed of the}} cable presents a technical difficulty; possible methods are to apply the grip gradually, to accelerate the vehicle (e.g. by guiding wheels) prior to applying the grip, or to use a sprung linkage between the grip and the vehicle. Also, the cable {{needs to be able to}} handle friction from the grip and increased load while the vehicle is accelerating.|$|R

50|$|Carriers are {{designed}} to seat 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 passengers. Each {{is connected to the}} cable with a steel <b>cable</b> <b>grip</b> that is either clamped onto or woven into the cable. Clamping systems use either a bolt system or coiled spring or magnets to provide clamping force. For maintenance or servicing, the carriers may be removed from or relocated along the rope by loosening the grip.|$|E
50|$|In 1927, {{she founded}} Kellems Cable Grips, Inc. in Connecticut {{to produce a}} {{patented}} <b>cable</b> <b>grip</b> invented with her brother, Edgar Eugene Kellems. The endless-weave grip was an improved version of the wire mesh grip in use {{at the time to}} pull, position, route and relieve strain of electrical cables. In 1928, Kellems solicited Queens Electric Light and Power Company and the Brooklyn Edison Company for a total of twenty orders.|$|E
25|$|The second theory uses grip {{placement}} and angle {{as the primary}} factor in targeting each head. For instance, to target the long head when using dumbbells or <b>cables,</b> the <b>grip</b> should be semi-supinated (hammer) grip where the palms face each other. If using a barbell (EZ grip or straight), the grip should be inside of shoulder width. To target the short head when using dumbbells or <b>cables,</b> <b>grip</b> should be supinated, where the palms are facing up completely. If using a barbell (EZ grip or straight), grip should be outside of shoulder width.|$|R
50|$|During the 1960s and 1970s GMD Mueller {{installed}} {{more than}} hundred fixed-grip chairlifts in North America. Many of these lifts {{are still in}} service today. In Europe 4-seater gondola lifts with Mueller's patented detachable <b>cable</b> <b>grips</b> and T-bars were more popular. Some resorts, such as Whistler were at the time exclusively equipped with Mueller lifts.|$|R
50|$|The lift {{operator}} on the Quicksilver lift {{pressed the}} button to make a routine stop, to allow a fallen skier {{to get out of}} the way of the unloading ramp. Instead, the emergency brake activated, sending shockwaves down the <b>cable.</b> <b>Grips</b> on at least two of the chairs slipped, and caused chairs to slide down the cable and slam into each other. In all, eight were injured, and two were killed in one of the worst ski lift accidents in North America. The lift's manufacturer, Lift Engineering/Yan, entered bankruptcy after the incident in July 1996. The cause was found to be a design fault in the Yan detachable grip. The Quicksilver lift was removed and replaced by the Creekside Gondola.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first part}} of the North Sydney tramway system was a {{double-track}} cable tramway which commenced at the original Milsons Point Ferry wharf, located where the north pylon of the Harbour Bridge is now.

50|$|On 29 December 1886 the Melbourne {{newspaper}} The Argus reprinted {{a report}} from the San Francisco Bulletin that Mr Noble had demonstrated a new 'motor car' for tramways 'with success'. The tramcar 'exactly similar in size, shape, and capacity to a <b>cable</b> <b>grip</b> car' had the 'motive power' of gas 'with which the reservoir is to be charged once a day at power stations by means of a rubber hose'. The car also carried an electricity generator for 'lighting up the tram and also for driving the engine on steep grades and effecting a start'.|$|E
50|$|The {{tightening}} {{is simply}} a normal behavior of a cylindrical, helically wound braid, usually the common biaxial braid. Pulling the entire braid lengthens and narrows it. The length is gained by reducing the angle between the warp and weft threads at their crossing points, but this reduces the radial distance between opposing sides and hence the overall circumference. The more one pulls, the more the circumference shrinks and the trap tightens. The same effect is used in specialized textile manufacturing, the Vivien Kellems <b>cable</b> <b>grip,</b> Indonesian woven fruit presses, and by fly-fishers.|$|E

The museum also owns two ex-Brisbane trams, {{one of which is}} on long-term loan to the Tramway Historical Society, a <b>cable</b> car <b>grip</b> tram and trailer from the original Wellington cable car, and a small collection of diesel buses and trolley buses from Wellington and New Plymouth.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{being called}} South of Market {{this area was}} called [...] "South of the Slot", a {{reference}} to the cable cars that ran up and down Market along the slots through which they <b>gripped</b> <b>cables.</b> While the cable cars have long since disappeared from Market Street, some [...] "old timers" [...] still refer to this area as [...] "South of the Slot".|$|R
50|$|A <b>cable</b> <b>grip</b> is {{a device}} for {{propelling}} a vehicle by attaching {{to a wire}} cable (also called wire rope) running at a (relatively) constant speed. The vehicle may be suspended from the cable, {{as in the case}} of aerial lifts such as a gondola lift (télécabine), may be guided by rails, as in a cable traction railway, or may be self-guiding, as in a button lift. Typically, multiple vehicles will use the same cable; where just one or two vehicles are in use they will tend to be attached to the cable permanently (e.g. funiculars).|$|E
50|$|The {{significance}} of detachable chairlift technology is primarily {{the speed and}} capacity. Detachable chairlifts move far faster than their fixed-grip brethren, averaging 1200 feet per minute (13.6 mph, 6 m/s) versus a typical fix-grip speed of 500 ft/min (5.5 mph, 2.5 m/s). Because the cable moves faster than most passengers could safely disembark and load, each chair {{is connected to the}} cable by a powerful spring-loaded <b>cable</b> <b>grip</b> which detaches at terminals, allowing the chair to slow considerably for convenient loading and unloading at a typical speed of 200 ft/min (2.2 mph, 1 m/s), a speed slower even than fixed-grip bunny chairlifts.|$|E

40|$|Tractors {{provide the}} primary source of power for most farming operations. Their {{mobility}} makes them adaptable to different production practices. However, they have two major disadvantages: soil compaction resulting from multiple passes of heavy power units, and inefficiency in transmitting power through tractive means. Cable farming systems were developed to overcome those disadvantages. Most, however, are used only for tillage operations, and employ a limited number of implements. A cable drawn farming system (CDFS) was developed which utilizes a modified linear move irrigation structure as its main frame. The system consists of a mobile truss, carriage, endless cable and controller. A multipurpose carriage system was designed for the CDFS. Finite element analysis was used to determine carrier frame and attachment structural requirements. An implement carrier of the carriage system was designed to be drawn by an endless cable, and to accommodate most three-point hitch implements, including PTO driven implements. An automatic <b>cable</b> <b>gripping</b> device was developed to connect the carriage to the cable. An electrical system was developed to provide power to the carrier through an electric trolley. A rail was designed to guide the carrier and support the electric lines. Potential harvesting scenarios were examined to identify material handling solutions. Evaluation suggested material handling requirements of vegetables could be best met with a conveyor system, while other crops might utilize trailers. A programmable logical controller (PLC) was selected and a control sequence is provided to accommodate the field operations. This research defined design parameters for a CDFS compatible with linear move irrigation system operations. Analytical results provide support for the concept of multipurpose use of a linear move irrigation system...|$|R
50|$|From the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, Sydney's electric tram system down Darling Street to the wharf and connected with the ferries. The trampway operated until 1954. As the road next to the wharf had a grade of 1 in 8, a unique counterweight dummy system was installed under the road surface to help push trams up the hill. An underground counterweight system was connected by cable to a <b>cable</b> tram <b>grip</b> dummy on the track on the surface. A tram descending would push the grip dummy ahead of it (which raised the counterweight). On the return journey, the grip dummy would give the tram a helpful push. The mechanism was preserved at the Sydney Tramway Museum when the tramway was removed.|$|R
50|$|Most grip {{cars were}} short and open. Four {{different}} types of grips were used, one by each company and the WCSR’s south and southwest lines using a fourth. CCR used a grip that could grip {{either side of the}} <b>cable,</b> allowing the <b>grip</b> car to operate in either direction. NCSR and WCSR grip cars could operate in one direction only. None of the grips could be used on other lines. Approximately 700 grip cars were in service.|$|R
50|$|The {{significance}} of detachable chairlift technology is primarily {{the speed and}} capacity. Detachable chairlifts move far faster than their fixed-grip brethren, averaging 1,000 feet per minute (12 mph, 18 km/h, 5.08 m/s) versus a typical fixed-grip speed of 500 ft/min (5.6 mph, 9 km/h, 2.54 m/s). Because the cable moves faster than most passengers could safely disembark and load, each chair {{is connected to the}} cable by a powerful spring-loaded <b>cable</b> <b>grip</b> which detaches at terminals, allowing the chair to slow considerably for convenient loading and unloading at a typical speed of 200 ft/min (2 mph, 4 km/h, 1 m/s), a speed slower even than fixed-grip bunny chairlifts.|$|E
50|$|The first {{practical}} {{cable car}} line was tested in San Francisco, in 1873. Part of its success {{is attributed to}} the development of an effective and reliable <b>cable</b> <b>grip</b> mechanism, to grab and release the moving cable without damage. The second city to operate cable trams was Dunedin in New Zealand, from 1881 to 1957. From 1885 to 1940, the city of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia operated one of the largest cable systems in the world, at its peak running 592 trams on 75 km of track. There were also two isolated cable lines in Sydney, Australia; the North Sydney line from 1886 to 1900, and the King Street line from 1892 to 1905.|$|E
40|$|Improved <b>cable</b> <b>grip</b> reduces wear due to sliding {{friction}} between cable and gripping surfaces. Drive wheels are grooved with a helical pattern that meshes with {{the lay of}} cable, analogous to a worm gear. Cable is gripped between drive wheels and guide rollers, and cable pull is exerted on the grip when drive wheels are slowed by hydraulic clutches. <b>Cable</b> <b>grip</b> may be applicable to cable-operated systems, such as ore trams in mines, overhead cable cars and ski lifts...|$|E
25|$|The Cable Car has two cars, which {{start from}} {{opposite}} ends of the line and pass in the middle. They are attached to each other by a 30mm diameter cable, supported by 120 rollers, which runs round a pulley {{at the top of the}} hill. A 185kW 550V DC motor at the top of the hill drives the pulley. The Cable Car is a funicular rather than a true cable car: the cars are permanently attached to the cable, which stops and starts as required, while a <b>cable</b> car <b>grips</b> and releases a continuously-moving cable. Wheels on the south side of car 1 and the north side of car 2 have double flanges, while the opposite wheels on each car have no flanges, directing the cars to the correct side of the mid-way passing loop at Talavera.|$|R
50|$|Grips also satisfy rigging needs on set. Examples {{of simple}} rigs include the menace arm, which allows a light to be boomed over set using one stand, or goalposts that span {{over top of}} set using two stands. More {{advanced}} rigs can include working with pulleys, steel <b>cable</b> or trusses. <b>Grips</b> also rig picture cars on process trailers, placing camera and lights around the vehicle for driving shots. This often includes the use of hood mounts, side mounts, suction cup mounts and proprietary clamps to attach film equipment to vehicles without causing damage.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare two {{different}} types of fixation systems used to reattach the greater trochanter after revision or total hip arthroplasty. This is a retrospective review of the results of patients that were treated with the two systems. We reviewed the clinical and radiological records of 35 hips with the Dall-Miles <b>cable</b> <b>grip</b> system (DMCGS) and 42 hips with the pin-sleeve system (PSS); follow-up averaged 24  months (range, 4 – 54) and 30  months (range, 11 – 42), respectively. The incidences of unsatisfactory clinical and radiological results in the PSS group was less than half that in the DMCGS group. Significant differences were found between the groups with respect to discomfort, tenderness, pain on motion, cable fragmentation, and bone absorption. Compared with the DMCGS, these results suggest the PSS could be the instrument of choice for re-attachment of the greater trochanter in hip arthroplasty...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background A {{variety of}} {{techniques}} {{are available for}} fixation of femoral shaft fractures following total hip arthroplasty. The optimal surgical repair method still remains a point of controversy in the literature. However, few studies have quantified the performance of such repair constructs. This study biomechanically examined 3 different screw-plate and cable-plate systems for fixation of periprosthetic femoral fractures near {{the tip of a}} total hip arthroplasty. Methods Twelve pairs of human cadaveric femurs were utilized. Each left femur was prepared for the cemented insertion of the femoral component of a total hip implant. Femoral fractures were created in the femurs and subsequently repaired with Construct A (Zimmer Cable Ready System), Construct B (AO Cable-Plate System), or Construct C (Dall-Miles <b>Cable</b> <b>Grip</b> System). Right femora served as matched intact controls. Axial, torsional, and four-point bending tests were performed to obtain stiffness values. Results All repair systems showed 3. 08 to 5. 33 times greater axial stiffness over intact control specimens. Four-point normalized bending (0. 69 to 0. 85) and normalized torsional (0. 55 to 0. 69) stiffnesses were lower than intact controls for most comparisons. Screw-plates provided either greater or equal stiffness compared to cable-plates in almost all cases. There were no statistical differences between plating systems A, B, or C when compared to each other (p > 0. 05). Conclusions Screw-plate systems provide more optimal mechanical stability than cable-plate systems for periprosthetic femur fractures near the tip of a total hip arthroplasty. </p...|$|E
25|$|The {{driver of}} a cable car {{is known as}} the gripman or grip operator. This is a highly skilled job, {{requiring}} the gripman to smoothly operate the grip lever to grip and release the <b>cable,</b> release the <b>grip</b> at certain points to coast the vehicle over crossing cables or places where the cable does not follow the tracks, and to anticipate well in advance possible collisions with other traffic that may not understand the limitations of a cable car. Being a gripman requires great upper body strength needed for the grip and brakes, as well as good hand–eye coordination and balance.|$|R
5000|$|Cable cars {{suffered}} from high infrastructure costs, since an expensive system of cables, pulleys, stationary engines and lengthy underground vault structures beneath the rails {{had to be}} provided. They also required physical strength and skill to operate, and alert operators to avoid obstructions and other cable cars. The cable had to be disconnected ("dropped") at designated locations to allow the cars to coast by inertia, for example when crossing another cable line. The cable would then have to be [...] "picked up" [...] to resume progress, the whole operation requiring precise timing to avoid damage to the <b>cable</b> and the <b>grip</b> mechanism.|$|R
25|$|On 25 September 1883, {{a test of}} a {{cable car}} system was held by Liverpool United Tramways and Omnibus Company in Kirkdale, Liverpool. This {{would have been the}} first cable car system in Europe, but the company decided against {{implementing}} it. Instead, the distinction went to the 1884 route from Archway to Highgate, north London, which used a continuous <b>cable</b> and <b>grip</b> system on the 1 in 11 (9%) climb of Highgate Hill. The installation was not reliable and was replaced by electric traction in 1909. Other cable car systems were implemented in Europe, though, among which was the Glasgow District Subway, the first underground cable car system, in 1896. (London, England's first deep-level tube railway, the City & South London Railway, had earlier also been built for cable haulage but had been converted to electric traction before opening in 1890.) A few more cable car systems were built in the United Kingdom, Portugal, and France. European cities, having many more curves in their streets, were ultimately less suitable for cable cars than American cities.|$|R
5000|$|The {{operating}} lever raises and lowers the center plate of the grip, {{which in turn}} operates the jaws. With the lever fully forward, the grip is open, and the cable is free to fall out (necessary when the cable crosses under another line, {{as well as at}} the ends of lines, and at [...] "let-go" [...] curves). With the cable lifted into the jaws, the {{operating lever}} is pulled back, forcing the jaws between two fixed rollers, and capturing the <b>cable</b> between the <b>grip's</b> replaceable mild-steel dies (but without applying pressure). To start moving the car, the operating lever is pulled back further, squeezing the cable between the dies.|$|R
