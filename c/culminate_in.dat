The attack on Corel was initially written to be due to the discovery of Mako energy and Shinra's desire to keep its existence a secret.

5|$|In the 14th century, {{recurrent}} civil wars, {{attacks from}} Bulgaria and Serbia in the Balkans and the devastation caused by ever-increasing Turkish raids hastened {{the collapse of}} the Byzantine state, which would <b>culminate</b> <b>in</b> its final fall to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. Several emperors after Andronikos II also tried to re-build a fleet, especially in order to secure the security and hence the independence of Constantinople itself from the interference of the Italian maritime powers, but their efforts produced only short-term results.|$|E
5|$|Umar al-Aqta {{was able}} to {{overcome}} the initial Byzantine resistance against his invasion and reach {{the shores of the}} Black Sea. The Byzantines then mobilized all their forces, and the Arab army was encircled near the River Lalakaon. The subsequent battle ended in a complete Byzantine victory and the death of the Emir on the field, and was followed by a successful Byzantine counteroffensive across the border. The Byzantine victories proved decisive: the main threats to the Byzantine borderlands were eliminated, and the era of Byzantine ascendancy in the East, which would <b>culminate</b> <b>in</b> the great conquests of the 10th century, had begun.|$|E

5|$|A new Belarusian {{constitution}} {{enacted in}} early 1994 {{paved the way}} for the first democratic presidential election on 23 June and 10 July. Six candidates stood in the first round, including Lukashenko, who campaigned as an independent on a populist platform. Shushkevich and Kebich also ran, with the latter regarded as the clear favorite. Lukashenko won 45.1% of the vote while Kebich received 17.4%, Zyanon Paznyak received 12.9% and Shushkevich, along with two other candidates, received less than 10% of votes. Lukashenko won the second round of the election on 10 July with 80.1% of the vote. Shortly after his election, he addressed the State Duma of the Russian Federation in Moscow proposing a new Union of Slavic states, which would <b>culminate</b> <b>in</b> the creation of the Union State in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Animals is {{the tenth}} studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, {{released}} on 23 January 1977 by Harvest Records in the United Kingdom and by Columbia Records in the United States. It {{is a concept}} album that provides a scathing critique of the social-political conditions of late-1970s Britain, and presents a marked change in musical style from their earlier work. Animals was recorded at the band's studio, Britannia Row, in London, but its production was punctuated by the early signs of discord that three years later would <b>culminate</b> <b>in</b> keyboardist Richard Wright leaving the band. The album's cover image, a pig floating between two chimneys of the Battersea Power Station, was conceived by the band's bassist and lead songwriter Roger Waters, and was designed by long-time collaborator Storm Thorgerson of Hipgnosis.|$|E
5|$|Dhaka has {{the largest}} number of schools, colleges and {{universities}} of any Bangladeshi city. The education system is divided into 5 levels: Primary (from grades 1 to 6), Junior (from grades 6 to 8), Secondary (from grades 9 to 10), Higher Secondary (from grades 11 to 12) and tertiary. The five years of Primary education concludes with a Primary School Completion (PSC) Examination, the three years of Junior education concludes with Junior School Certificate (JSC) Examination, and next two years of Secondary education concludes with a Secondary School Certificate (SSC) Examination. Students who pass this examination proceed to two years of Higher Secondary or intermediate training, which <b>culminate</b> <b>in</b> a Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSC) Examination. Education is mainly offered in Bengali, but English is also widely taught and used. Many Muslim families send their children to attend part-time courses or even to pursue full-time religious education alongside other subjects, which is imparted in Bengali and Arabic in schools, colleges and madrasas.|$|E

5|$|Francis {{spends most}} of the season as the newly {{appointed}} Vice President of the United States. In early episodes Frank vanquishes reporters on the trail of a murder he committed in the previous season. However, the drama soon shifts to tensions involving Frank, President Walker, the Chinese government, and the wealthy Raymond Tusk, eventually culminating in a bitter political war between Frank and Tusk. Frank's wife Claire publicly reveals that she was raped in college by a prominent general and pursues anti-rape legislation. The most significant new character is Jackie Sharp, Frank's successor as House Whip, who soon finds herself embroiled in Frank's plans. As the war between Frank and Tusk consumes the Presidency, things <b>culminate</b> <b>in</b> a scandal that leads to Walker resigning, Tusk being arrested, and Frank ascending to the Oval Office.|$|E

On 3 September 1940 Alfred, Erna, and Stefan boarded the Nea Hellas in Lisbon, reaching New York six days later; in October they moved to Los Angeles. Döblin worked briefly for Metro Goldwyn Mayer writing screenplays for 100 dollars a week, but his contract expired in October 1941 and was not renewed, despite the interventions of Thomas Mann and others. Alfred, Erna, and Stefan were baptized as Roman Catholics in Hollywood's Blessed Sacrament Church on 30 November 1941.|$|E
5|$|In 1956 growing {{diplomatic}} {{tensions in}} the Middle East, tensions that would soon <b>culminate</b> <b>in</b> the Suez Crisis, resulted in the resurrection of 69 Squadron. On April 19 the IAF issued an order reactivating the squadron at Ramat David, with Nahum Efrat as its commanding officer. The squadron was soon tasked with its first mission, allocating two B-17s for search and rescue operations during Dassault Mystère delivery flights from France to Israel. The reformed squadron once again began training personnel and equipping the aircraft for possible hostilities. As Israel purchased more jet fighters, however, room {{had to be made}} for the new arrivals, and in September 1956 the IAF ordered the squadron to send its aircraft into storage and changed its status to reserve. By October 3 the aircraft had been stored at Bedek Aviation (later Israeli Aircraft Industries) at Lod, but only three weeks later, on October 25, the IAF activated the squadron once more.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Salamis {{marked the}} {{turning point in the}} Greco-Persian wars. After Salamis, the Peloponnese, and by {{extension}} Greece as an entity, was safe from conquest; and the Persians suffered a major blow to their prestige and morale (as well as severe material losses). At the following battles of Plataea and Mycale, the threat of conquest was removed, and the Allies were able to go on the counter-offensive. The Greek victory allowed Macedon to revolt against Persian rule; and over the next 30 years, Thrace, the Aegean Islands and finally Ionia would be removed from Persian control by the Allies, or by the Athenian-dominated successor, the Delian League. Salamis started a decisive swing in the balance of power toward the Greeks, which would <b>culminate</b> <b>in</b> an eventual Greek victory, severely reducing Persian power in the Aegean.|$|E
5|$|The main upland {{areas are}} the Mendip Hills in the {{northeast}} and the Quantock Hills further west.

They <b>culminate</b> <b>in</b> the promontory of Brean Down, only to crop up again in the Bristol Channel as the islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm. Steep Holm is part of Somerset while Flat Holm is the most southerly point of Wales. The Mendips are composed of Carboniferous Limestone and water erosion has created gorges, dry valleys, screes, swallets and caves as well as various karst features.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposal}} for a hydro-electric barrier to generate 8.6GW and meet five percent of Britain's power needs, is being opposed by some environmental groups.

The first, which is likely to run until late 2008, will focus on high-level issues and reach an initial view on whether there are any fundamental issues that would preclude a tidal scheme in the Severn Estuary. Subject to the decision {{at the end of the}} first phase, the second phase will look at the issues in more detail and <b>culminate</b> <b>in</b> a full public consultation in early 2010.|$|E
