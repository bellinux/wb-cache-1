25|$|There {{are five}} typical autosomal-recessive {{disorders}} in which ataxia is a prominent feature: Friedreich ataxia, ataxia-telangiectasia, ataxia with vitamin E deficiency, ataxia with oculomotor apraxia (AOA), spastic ataxia. Disorder subdivisions: Friedreich's ataxia, Spinocerebellar ataxia, Ataxia telangiectasia, Vasomotor ataxia, Vestibulocerebellar, Ataxiadynamia, Ataxiophemia, Olivopontocerebellar atrophy, and <b>Charcot-Marie-Tooth</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
50|$|Symptoms {{are usually}} more severe and rapidly {{progressive}} {{than in the}} other more common <b>Charcot-Marie-Tooth</b> <b>diseases.</b> Some patients may never walk and solely use wheelchairs {{by the end of}} their first decade, while others may need only a cane (walking stick) or similar support through life.|$|R
40|$|Patients with <b>Charcot-Marie-Tooth</b> (CMT) <b>disease</b> most {{commonly}} have a slowly progressive neuropathy where ankle dorsifl exion weakness {{is much more}} prominent than ankle plantar fl exion weakness. The eventual involvement of the ankle plantar fl exors has major functional consequences for patients as they lose the ability to stand still. We have found the knee bob sign whereby both knees bob up and down when standing still to be a reliable marker of ankle plantar fl exion weakness in CMT.

25|$|To {{confirm the}} diagnosis, a {{physician}} must rule out other causes of similar clinical syndromes.

25|$|<b>Charcot–Marie–Tooth</b> <b>disease</b> (CMT) is a {{heterogeneous}} inherited disorder of nerves (neuropathy) that {{is characterized by}} loss of muscle tissue and touch sensation, predominantly in the feet and legs {{but also in the}} hands and arms in the advanced stages of disease.

40|$|Calcium uptake on muscle microsomal {{fraction}} {{has been}} investigated in connection with bioelectrical activity in some muscle diseases. The findings showed a significant increase of calcium uptake in denervated muscle, which exhibited spontaneous bioelectrical activity (fibrillations). In myotonias, a low calcium uptake was peculiar to Steinert's disease but not to myotonia congenita. In other muscle diseases, such as progressive muscular dystrophy (Duchenne's type) or <b>Charcot-Marie-Tooth's</b> <b>disease,</b> the ability of muscle microsomal fraction to bind calcium was not changed. Starting with the key role of calcium in excitation-contraction coupling, the implications of calcium uptake disturbances in muscle electrogenesis are discussed...|$|R

30|$|Foot deformities, {{including}} pes cavus, hammer toes, {{and twisting}} of the ankle, are commonly present in some HPN forms, such as <b>Charcot–Marie–Tooth</b> (CMT) <b>disease,</b> hereditary neuropathy with predisposition to pressure palsies (HNPP), and distal hereditary motor neuropathy (DHMN) [4], but are uncommon {{in the other}} HPN. We will therefore discuss only the clinical features and genetic basis of HPN associated with pes cavus.|$|R
25|$|<b>Charcot–Marie–Tooth</b> <b>disease</b> (CMT) is {{the most}} common form of {{hereditary}} neuropathy and can be further subdivided into two types: Type 1: demyelinating, and Type 2: axonal. Measurement of chronaxie and rheobase for these diseased nerves has concluded that electrophysiologically, a patient with demyelinating (Type I) CMT demonstrates slow nerve conduction velocity, frequently accompanied by reduced amplitudes of motor and sensory action potentials; moreover, axonal (Type II) CMT can be attributed to impaired interaction between Schwann cells and axons. Changes in excitability measures are typically universal and vary little between patients, and this is likely due to the diffuse distribution of demyelination, suggesting changed cable properties associated with short internodes.|$|E

2500|$|Persons {{suffering}} from peripheral neuropathy experience numbness and tingling {{in their hands}} and feet. This can cause ambulation impairment, such as trouble climbing stairs or maintaining balance. Gait abnormality is also common in persons with nervous system problems such as cauda equina syndrome, [...] multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, myasthenia gravis, normal pressure hydrocephalus, and <b>Charcot–Marie–Tooth</b> <b>disease.</b> Research has shown that neurological gait abnormalities are {{associated with an increased}} risk of falls in older adults.|$|E
50|$|Mutations in {{this gene}} could also cause {{neurological}} abnormalities. Indeed, {{one form of}} <b>Charcot-Marie-Tooth</b> (CMT) <b>disease</b> {{has been associated with}} DHTKD1, although the disease encompasses a wide spectrum of clinical neuropathies. Specifically, a hyterozygous nonsense mutation within the gene leads to decreased levels of DHTKD1 mRNA and proteins, and impaired ATP generation. This implicates this mutation as a causative agent for CMT-2 Disease.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Background: Several {{problems}} {{are associated with}} manual muscle testing and dynamometry {{in the hands of}} patients with <b>Charcot–Marie–Tooth</b> (CMT) <b>disease.</b> Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of the Rotterdam Intrinsic Hand Myometer (RIHM) to directly measure intrinsic hand muscle strength in CMT disease. Methods: We measured hand muscle strength and hand function in 41 patients with CMT disease. Results: RIHM measurement of intrinsic strength had excellent reliability. We found overlapping RIHM strength values in Medical Research Council grades 3 to 5. High grip and pinch strength could be found in patients with severe intrinsic muscle weakness. RIHM measurements were more strongly correlated with fine motor skills of the hand than grip and pinch strength. Conclusions: The Rotterdam Intrinsic Hand Myometer is a reliable instrument to measure intrinsic hand muscles strength in patients with Charcot– Marie–Tooth disease, providing more detailed information than manual muscle testing and a more direct assessment of intrinsic muscle loss than grip and pinch dynamometers.

25|$|Dr. Bellen’s current {{research}} focuses on an effort to decipher the mechanisms by which mutations in specific genes cause neurodegeneration, and to this end, {{he and his colleagues}} performed unbiased forward genetic screens in fruitflies that detect the progressive decline in function and morphology of photoreceptor neurons. To date over 165 genes that cause a neurodegenerative phenotype when mutated have been uncovered by Dr. Bellen’s group using this strategy. Many of these genes encode homologues of human genes that are known to cause neurodegenerative diseases, including Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) (Lou Gehrig's <b>disease),</b> <b>Charcot-Marie-Tooth</b> (CMT), Parkinson’s <b>disease</b> (PD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Leigh syndrome, and others, and these studies will help provide a much better understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which neurodegeneration occurs.
