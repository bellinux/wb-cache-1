5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} <b>can</b> <b>live</b> {{for more}} than 40 years. Females typically live 5-10 years longer than males, with some females exceeding 60 years. This extreme age is rare and less than 2% of all Bottlenose dolphins will live longer than 60 years. Bottlenose Dolphin can jump at a height of 6 meters (20 feet) up in the air; they use this to communicate with one another.|$|E
5|$|Common toads <b>can</b> <b>live</b> {{for many}} years and have survived for fifty years in captivity. In the wild, common toads are thought to live for about ten to twelve years. Their age can be {{determined}} by counting the number of annual growth rings in the bones of their phalanges.|$|E
5|$|E. coli <b>can</b> <b>live</b> on a {{wide variety}} of {{substrates}} and uses mixed-acid fermentation in anaerobic conditions, producing lactate, succinate, ethanol, acetate, and carbon dioxide. Since many pathways in mixed-acid fermentation produce hydrogen gas, these pathways require the levels of hydrogen to be low, as is the case when E. coli lives together with hydrogen-consuming organisms, such as methanogens or sulphate-reducing bacteria.|$|E

5|$|Like other arthropods, spiders have to molt to grow {{as their}} cuticle ("skin") cannot stretch.

5|$|Once {{the flea}} reaches adulthood, its {{primary goal is}} to find blood and then to reproduce. Female fleas can lay 5000 or more eggs over their life, {{permitting}} rapid increase in numbers. Generally speaking, an adult flea only lives for 2 or 3 months. Without a host to provide a blood meal, a flea's life can be as short as a few days. Under ideal conditions of temperature, food supply, and humidity, adult fleas <b>can</b> <b>live</b> {{for up to a}} year and a half. Completely developed adult fleas <b>can</b> <b>live</b> for several months without eating, so long as they do not emerge from their puparia. Optimum temperatures for the flea's life cycle are 21°C to 30°C (70°F to 85°F) and optimum humidity is 70%.|$|E

5|$|Sperm whales <b>can</b> <b>live</b> 70 {{years or}} more. They are {{a prime example}} of a species that has been K-selected, meaning their {{reproductive}} strategy is associated with stable environmental conditions and comprises a low birth rate, significant parental aid to offspring, slow maturation, and high longevity.|$|E
5|$|The species easily {{attaches}} {{itself to}} stones, which {{allows it to}} live in fast-running waters and in wave zone in lakes. The ability of Theodoxus fluviatilis to live in freshwater and also in brackish water demonstrates the phenotypic plasticity of this species. This small snail <b>can</b> <b>live</b> in up to 60 m depth in coastal waters. Brackish water populations <b>can</b> <b>live</b> in salinities of up to 15‰ in the Baltic Sea or up to 18‰ in the Baltic Sea and in Black Sea. Populations from brackish water can tolerate higher salinity than populations from freshwater. Brackish water populations have much higher accumulation of ninhydrin-positive substances in the foot.|$|E
