40|$|We {{report on}} a novel method for the {{fabrication}} of three-dimensional buried graphitic micropaths in single crystal diamond with the employment of focused MeV ions. The use of implantation masks with graded thickness at the sub-micrometer scale allows the formation of conductive channels which are embedded in the insulating matrix at controllable depths. In particular, the modulation of the channels depth at their endpoints allows the surface contacting of the <b>channel</b> <b>terminations</b> with no need of further fabrication stages. In the present work we describe the sample masking, which includes the deposition of semi spherical gold contacts on the sample surface, followed by MeV ion implantation. Because of the {{significant difference between the}} densities of pristine and amorphous or graphitized diamond, the formation of buried channels has a relevant mechanical effect on the diamond structure, causing localized surface swelling, which has been measured both with interferometric profilometry and atomic force microscopy. The electrical properties of the buried channels are then measured with a two point probe station: clear evidence is given that only the terminal points of the channels are electrically connected with the surface, {{while the rest of the}} channels extends below the surface.

40|$|Integrated {{circuits}} (ICs) {{are usually}} tested during manufacture {{by means of}} automatic testing equipment (ATE) employing probe cards and needles that make repeated physical contact with the ICs under test. Such direct-contact probing is very costly and imposes limitations {{on the use of}} ATE. For example, the probe needles must be frequently cleaned or replaced, and some emerging technologies such as three-dimensional ICs cannot be probed at all. As an alternative to conventional probe-card testing, wireless testing has been proposed. It mitigates many of the foregoing problems by replacing probe needles and contact points with wireless communication circuits. However, wireless testing also raises new problems which are poorly understood such as: What is the most suitable wireless communication technique to employ, and how well does it work in practice? This dissertation addresses the design and implementation of circuits to support wireless testing of ICs. Various wireless testing methods are investigated and evaluated with respect to their practicality. The research focuses on near-field capacitive communication because of its efficiency over the very short ranges needed during IC manufacture. A new capacitive channel model including chip separation, cross-talk, and misalignment effects is proposed and validated using electro-magnetic simulation studies to provide the intuitions for efficient antenna and circuit design. We propose a compact clock and data recovery architecture to avoid a dedicated clock channel. An analytical model which predicts the DC-level fluctuation due to the capacitive channel is presented. Based on this model, feed-forward clock selection is designed to enhance performance. A method to select proper <b>channel</b> <b>termination</b> is discussed to maximize the channel efficiency for return-to-zero signaling. Two prototype ICs incorporating wireless testing systems were fabricated and tested with the proposed methods of testing digital circuits. Both successfully demonstrated gigahertz communication speeds with a bit-error rate less than 10 ^− 11. A third prototype IC containing analog voltage measurement circuits was implemented to determine the feasibility of wirelessly testing analog circuits. The fabricated prototype achieved satisfactory voltage measurement with 1 mV resolution. Our work demonstrates the validity of the proposed models and the feasibility of near-field capacitive communication for wireless testing of ICs...|$|E
40|$|The {{ionic current}} {{underlying}} the upstroke of axonal action potentials is carried by rapidly activating, voltage-dependent Na+ <b>channels.</b> <b>Termination</b> {{of the action}} potential is mediated {{in part by the}} rapid inactivation of these Na+ channels. We previously demonstrated that an influx of Na+ plays a critical role in the cascade leading to irreversible anoxic injury in central nervous system white matter. We speculated that a noninactivating Na+ conductance mediates this pathological Na+ influx and persists at depolarized membrane potentials as seen in anoxic axons. In the present study we measured the resting compound membrane potential of rat optic nerves using a modified "grease-gap" technique. Application of tetrodotoxin (2 microM) to resting nerves ([K+]o = 3 mM) or to nerves depolarized by 15 or 40 mM K+ resulted in hyperpolarizing shifts of membrane potential. We interpret these shifts as evidence for a persistent, noninactivating Na+ conductance. This conductance is present at rest and persists in nerves depolarized sufficiently to abolish classical transient Na+ currents. PK/PNa ratios were estimated at 35. 5, 23. 2, and 88 in 3 mM, 15 mM, and 40 mM K+, respectively. We suggest that this noninactivating Na+ conductance may provide an inward pathway for Na+ ions, necessary for the operation of Na+, K(+) -ATPase. Under pathological conditions, such as anoxia, this conductance is the likely route of Na+ influx, which causes damaging Ca 2 + entry through reverse operation of the Na(+) -Ca 2 + exchanger. The presence of this conductance in white matter axons may provide a therapeutic opportunity for diseases such as stroke and spinal cord injury...|$|R

Here we present debrites from four late Quaternary environments: (i) within the Rosetta submarine channel at 1700 m; (ii) within small basins created by salt tectonics in the Eastern Province at 1300 m; (iii) on the open slope outside of channels at 2600 m; and (iv) in the distal part of the fan fringe beyond <b>channel</b> <b>terminations</b> at 3050 m water depth. The debrites comprise mud clasts in a generally ungraded muddy sand matrix. They are relatively thin (20 - 150 cm) in fan fringe, in channel and salt-tectonic basin settings, and somewhat thicker (> 8 m) in the open slope setting. Benthic foraminiferal assemblages and variation in the planktonic/benthic foraminiferal ratios are considered as {{a useful tool for}} tentatively evaluating the origin of sediment in these debris flows and estimation of their run-out distance. Similar microfaunal contents of clast/matrix combinations document that the debrites in the Rosetta channel and salt-tectonic basin were locally sourced. The debrite from the open slope travelled farther (up to 150 km). Three separate debrites in a fan fringe core were deposited by debris flows that originated over 200 km away in water depths shallower than 1000 m. These far-travelled debris flows appear to have eroded remarkably little sediment as they travelled for ∼ 200 km across low (0. 8 - 1. 2 °) gradient seafloor. This lack of erosion is attributed to hydroplaning or increasing pore-fluid pressure at the base of debris flows. This study confirms that remarkably mobile debris flows can travel long distances to produce thin debrites in the distal fringes of submarine fans...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{propose a}} {{rigorous}} comparison of information flow monitors {{with respect to}} two dimensions: soundness and transparency. For soundness, we notice that the standard information flow security definition called Termination-Insensitive Noninterference (TINI) allows the presence of <b>termination</b> <b>channels,</b> however it does not describe whether the <b>termination</b> <b>channel</b> was present in the original program, or it was added by a monitor. We propose a stronger notion of noninterference, that we call Termination-Aware Noninterference (TANI), that captures this fact, and thus allows us to better evaluate the security guarantees of different monitors. We further investigate TANI, and state its formal relations to other soundness guarantees of information flow monitors. For transparency, we identify different notions from the literature that aim at comparing the behaviour of monitors. We notice that one common notion used in the literature is not adequate since it identifies as better a monitor that accepts insecure executions, and hence may augment {{the knowledge of the}} attacker. To discriminate between monitors' behaviours on secure and insecure executions, we factorized two notions that we call true and false transparency. These notions allow us to compare monitors that were deemed to be incomparable in the past. We analyse five widely explored information flow monitors: no-sensitive-upgrade (NSU), permissive-upgrade (PU), hybrid monitor (HM), secure multi-execution (SME), and multiple facets (MF) ...|$|R
40|$|Many digital {{communication}} standards employ convolution coding {{as a means}} of forward error correction (FEC). Data encoded in this way generally is decoded with a Viterbi decoder, which operates by constructing a trellis of state probabilities and branch metrics. The transmitted data is often terminated with a number of zeros to force the encoder back to the zero state. This allows the decoder to start decoding from a known state, however, extra symbols have to be transmitted over the <b>channel.</b> Another <b>termination</b> technique is to ensure the trellis start and end states are identical. This technique is referred to as tail biting and has the advantage of not requiring any extra symbols to be transmitted. Tail biting is used in several popular communications standards, such as the IEEE Standard for Local and Metropolitan Area Networks- Part 16 (IEEE 802. 16 e) and the 3 GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard. This application note gives some background on the different termination techniques used in these standards, explains how to implement them using the Xilinx ® Viterbi decoder LogiCORE ™ module (version 6. 2 or later), and includes a number of simulation reference designs to illustrate operation of the Viterbi decoder...|$|R
40|$|Data {{transmission}} on high-speed channels may {{be affected}} by several undesired effects, including coupling from nearby interconnects, dispersion, losses, signal reflections from terminations and from internal discontinuities, and nonlinear/dynamic effects of drivers and receivers. The latter are often neglected, leading to very fast solvers, whose results may however be questionable when driver/receiver nonlinearities are important. This paper presents a framework for the transient analysis of complex high-speed channels with arbitrary nonlinear termination circuits. The approach is based on decoupling <b>channel</b> and <b>terminations</b> through a scattering-based Waveform Relaxation (WR) formulation. The channels are here cast as delay-rational macromodels, which are solved in discrete time domain through fast delayed recursive convolutions. The terminations can be either arbitrary circuits, solved by SPICE, or nonlinear behavioral macromodels, which are here formulated in discrete-time scattering representations. In order to overcome the known convergence issues of standard WR methods, we apply here more general iterative solution schemes, such as GMRES and BiCGSTAB, integrated into inexact Newton iterations, obtaining a set of numerical schemes with guaranteed convergence. The excellent performance of the proposed approach is illustrated on a large set of benchmark...|$|R
40|$|Oblivious RAM (ORAM) is {{a renowned}} {{technique}} {{to hide the}} access patterns of an application to an untrusted memory. According to the standard ORAM definition presented by Goldreich and Ostrovsky, two ORAM access sequences must be computationally indistinguishable if the lengths of these sequences are identically distributed. An artifact of this definition {{is that it does}} not apply to modern ORAM implementations adapted in current secure processors technology because of their arbitrary lengths of memory access sequences depending on programs' behaviors (their termination times). As a result, the ORAM definition does not directly apply; the theoretical foundations of ORAM do not clearly argue about the timing and <b>termination</b> <b>channels.</b> This paper conducts a first rigorous study of the standard Goldreich-Ostrovsky ORAM definition in view of modern practical ORAMs (e. g., Path ORAM) and demonstrates the gap between theoretical foundations and real implementations. A new ORAM formulation which clearly separates out <b>termination</b> <b>channel</b> leakage is proposed. It is shown how this definition implies the standard ORAM definition (for finite length input access sequences) and better fits the modern practical ORAM implementations. The proposed definition relaxes the constraints around the stash size and overflow probability for Path ORAM, and essentially transforms its security argument into a performance consideration problem. Finally, a `strong' ORAM formulation which clearly includes obfuscation of termination leakage is shown to imply our new ORAM formulation and applies to ORAM for outsourced disk storage. In this strong formulation constraints are not relaxed and the security argument for Path ORAM remains complex as one needs to prove that the stash overflows with negligible probability...|$|R
40|$|When {{termination}} {{of a program}} is observable by an adversary, confidential information may be leaked by terminating accordingly.

We address concurrent <b>termination</b> and timing <b>channels</b> by presenting a dynamic information-flow control system that mitigates and eliminates these <b>channels</b> while allowing <b>termination</b> and timing to depend on secret values. Intuitively, we leverage concurrency by placing such potentially sensitive actions in separate threads. While termination and timing of these threads may expose secret values, our system requires any thread observing these properties to raise its information-flow label accordingly, preventing leaks to lower-labeled contexts.

40|$|AbstractTo {{clarify the}} {{molecular}} mechanisms behind quantal Ca 2 + release, the graded Ca 2 + release from intracellular stores through inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate receptor (InsP 3 R) channels responding to incremental ligand stimulation, single-channel patch-clamp electrophysiology {{was used to}} continuously monitor the number and open probability of InsP 3 R channels in the same excised cytoplasmic-side-out nuclear membrane patches exposed alternately to optimal and suboptimal cytoplasmic ligand conditions. Progressively more channels were activated by more favorable conditions in patches from insect cells with only one InsP 3 R gene or from cells solely expressing one recombinant InsP 3 R isoform, demonstrating that channels with identical primary sequence have different ligand recruitment thresholds. Such heterogeneity was largely abrogated, in a fully reversible manner, by treatment of the channels with sulfhydryl reducing agents, suggesting that it was mostly regulated by different levels of posttranslational redox modifications of the channels. In contrast, sulfhydryl reduction had limited effects on channel open probability. Thus, sulfhydryl redox modification can regulate various aspects of intracellular Ca 2 + signaling, including quantal Ca 2 + release, by tuning ligand sensitivities of InsP 3 R <b>channels.</b> No intrinsic <b>termination</b> of <b>channel</b> activity with a timescale comparable to that for quantal Ca 2 + release was observed under any steady ligand conditions, indicating that this process is unlikely to contribute...|$|R
40|$|During {{vertebrate}} locomotion, spinal neurons act as oscillators when {{initiated by}} glutamate release from descending systems. Activation of NMDA receptors initiates Ca 2 +-mediated intrinsic membrane potential oscillations in {{central pattern generator}} (CPG) neurons. NMDA receptor-dependent intrinsic oscillations require Ca 2 +-dependent K+ (KCa 2) <b>channels</b> for burst <b>termination.</b> However, the location of Ca 2 + entry mediating KCa 2 channel activation, and type of Ca 2 + channel – which includes NMDA receptors and voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels (VGCCs) – remains elusive. NMDA receptor-dependent Ca 2 + entry necessitates presynaptic release of glutamate, implying a location at active synapses within dendrites, whereas VGCC-dependent Ca 2 + entry is not similarly constrained. Where Ca 2 + enters relative to KCa 2 channels is crucial to information processing of synaptic inputs necessary to coordinate locomotion. We demonstrate that Ca 2 + permeating NMDA receptors is the dominant source of Ca 2 + during NMDA-dependent oscillations in lamprey spinal neurons. This Ca 2 + entry is synaptically located, NMDA receptor-dependent, and sufficient to activate KCa 2 channels at excitatory interneuron synapses onto other CPG neurons. Selective blockade of VGCCs reduces whole-cell Ca 2 + entry but leaves membrane potential and Ca 2 + oscillations unaffected. Furthermore, repetitive oscillations are prevented by fast, but not slow, Ca 2 + chelation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that KCa 2 channels are closely located to NMDA receptor-dependent C...|$|R
40|$|Privacy {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} security concerns in radio frequency identification. The publication of hundred RFID-based authentication protocols during the last decade raised the need of designing a dedicated privacy model. An important step has been done with the model of Vaudenay that combines early models into a unified and powerful one. In particular, this model addresses the case where an adversary is able to know whether or not the protocol execution succeeded. This modelizes the fact that the adversary may get information from a side <b>channel</b> about the <b>termination</b> of the protocol, e. g., she notices that the access is granted to the RFID-tag holder. We go one step forward in this paper and stress that the adversary may also have access to a side channel that leaks the computational time of the reader. This modelizes an adversary who measures how long it takes to grant the access. Although this channel could be seen as an implementation flaw, we consider that it is always risky to require the implementation to solve what the design should deal with. This new channel enables to demonstrate that many key-reference protocols are not as privacy-friendly as they claim to be, e. g., WSRE, OSK, C 2, O-FRAP, O-FRAKE, [...] . We then introduce the TIMEFUL oracle in the model of Vaudenay, which allows to analyze the resistance of the protocols to time-based attacks as soon as the design phase.

40|$|The {{contractile}} {{cycle of}} striated muscles, skeletal and cardiac, {{is controlled by}} a cytosolic [Ca 2 +] transient that requires rapid movements of the ion through channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). A functional signature of these channels is their closure after a stereotyped time lapse of Ca 2 + release. In cardiac muscle there is abundant evidence that termination of release is mediated by depletion of the Ca 2 + store, even if the linkage mechanism remains unknown. By contrast, in skeletal muscle the mechanisms of release termination are not understood. This article reviews measurements of store depletion, the experimental evidence for dependence of Ca 2 + release on the [Ca 2 +] level inside the SR, as well as tests of the molecular nature of putative intra-store Ca 2 + sensors. Because Ca 2 + sparks exhibit the basic release termination mechanism, much attention {{is dedicated to the}} studies of store depletion caused by sparks and its relationship with termination of sparks. The review notes the striking differences in volume, content and buffering power of the stores in cardiac vs. skeletal muscle, differences that explain why functional depletion is much greater for cardiac than skeletal muscle stores. Because in skeletal muscle store depletion is minimal and reduction in store [Ca 2 +] does not appear to greatly inhibit Ca 2 + release, it is concluded that decrease in free SR [Ca 2 +] does not mediate physiological termination of Ca 2 + release in this type of muscle. In spite of the apparent absence of store depletion and its putative <b>channel</b> closing effect, <b>termination</b> of Ca 2 + sparks is faster and more robust in skeletal than cardiac muscle. A gating role of a hypothetical "proximate store" constituted by polymers of calsequestrin and associated proteins is invoked in an attempt to preserve a role for store depletion and unify mechanisms in both types of striated muscle...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} that terminate Ca 2 + {{release from the}} sarcoplasmic reticulum are not fully understood. D 4 cpv-Casq 1 (Sztretye et al. 2011. J. Gen. Physiol. doi: 10. 1085 /jgp. 201010591) was used in mouse skeletal muscle cells under voltage clamp to measure free Ca 2 + concentration inside the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), [Ca 2 +]SR, simultaneously with that in the cytosol, [Ca 2 +]c, during the response to long-lasting depolarization of the plasma membrane. The ratio of Ca 2 + release flux (derived from [Ca 2 +]c(t)) over the gradient that drives it (essentially equal to [Ca 2 +]SR) provided directly, for the first time, a dynamic measure of the permeability to Ca 2 + of the releasing SR membrane. During maximal depolarization, flux rapidly rises to a peak and then decays. Before 0. 5 s, [Ca 2 +]SR stabilized at ∼ 35 % of its resting level; depletion was therefore incomplete. By 0. 4 s of depolarization, the measured permeability decayed to ∼ 10 % of maximum, indicating ryanodine receptor channel closure. Inactivation of the t tubule voltage sensor was immeasurably small by this time and thus not {{a significant factor in}} channel closure. In cells of mice null for Casq 1, permeability did not decrease in the same way, indicating that calsequestrin (Casq) is essential in the mechanism of <b>channel</b> closure and <b>termination</b> of Ca 2 + release. The absence of this mechanism explains why the total amount of calcium releasable by depolarization is not greatly reduced in Casq-null muscle (Royer et al. 2010. J. Gen. Physiol. doi: 10. 1085 /jgp. 201010454). When the fast buffer BAPTA was introduced in the cytosol, release flux became more intense, and the SR emptied earlier. The consequent reduction in permeability accelerated as well, reaching comparable decay at earlier times but comparable levels of depletion. This observation indicates that [Ca 2 +]SR, sensed by Casq and transmitted to the channels presumably via connecting proteins, is determinant to cause the closure that terminates Ca 2 + release...|$|R
40|$|Iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) mineral {{plays an}} {{important}} role in a variety of atmospheric, terrestrial and technological settings. Molecular resolution of reactions involving these minerals is thereby required to develop a fundamental understanding of their contributions in processes taking place in the atmosphere, Earth’s upper crust as well as the hydrosphere. This study resolves interactions involving four different types of synthetic FeOOH particles with distinct and well-defined surfaces, namely lath- and rod-shaped lepidocrocite (γ), goethite (α) and akaganéite (β). The surface and bulk reactivities of these particles are controlled by their distinct structures. When exposed to ambient atmospheric or aqueous conditions their surfaces are populated with different types of (hydr) oxo functional groups acting as reaction centers. These sites consist of hydroxyl groups that can be singly- (≡FeOH, -OH), doubly- (≡Fe 2 OH, μ-OH), or triply-coordinated (≡Fe 3 OH, μ 3 -OH) with underlying Fe atoms. Moreover, these sites exhibit different types, densities, distributions, as well as hydrogen bonding patterns on different crystal planes for each mineral. Knowledge of the types and distributions of hydroxyl groups on minerals with different surface structures is fundamental for building a molecular-scale understanding of processes taking place at FeOOH particle surfaces. In this thesis, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to resolve the interactions between (hydr) oxo groups of FeOOH particles with (in) organic acids, salts, water vapor as well as carbon dioxide. The focus on such compounds was justified by their importance in natural environments. This thesis is based on 9 articles and manuscripts that can be found in the appendices. FTIR spectroscopic signatures of hydroxyl groups in the bulk of well crystallized FeOOH minerals were characterized for structural differences and thermal stabilities. Those of akaganéite were particularly resolved for the variable bond strength of bulk hydroxyls induced by the incorporation of HCl through nanostructured <b>channels</b> at the <b>terminations</b> of the particles. FTIR bands of hydroxyl groups at all particle surfaces were monitored for responses to thermal gradients and proton loadings, providing experimental validation to previous theoretical accounts on surface site reactivity. This site reactivity was resolved further in the fluoride (F-) and phosphate (PO 43 -) ions adsorption study to follow the site selectivity for ligand-exchange reactions. These efforts showed that singly-coordinated groups are the primary adsorption centers for ligands, doubly-coordinated groups can only be exchanged at substantially higher ligand loadings, while triply coordinated groups are largely resilient to any ligand-exchange reaction. These findings helped consolidate fundamental knowledge that can be used in investigating sorption processes involving atmospherically and geochemically important gases. The latter parts of this thesis were therefore focused on water vapor and carbon dioxide interactions with these FeOOH particles. These efforts showed how surface structure and speciation affect sorption loadings and configurations, as well as how water diffused into and through the akaganéite bulk. Hydrogen bonding is one of the most important forms of interactions between gas phase and minerals. It plays a crucial role in the formation of thin water films and in stabilizing surface (bi) carbonate species. The affinity of surface hydroxyl groups for water and carbon dioxide is strongly dependent on their abilities to form hydrogen bonds. These are controlled by coordination number and site accessibility/steric constraints. In agreement with the aforementioned ligand-exchange studies, surfaces dominated by singly coordinated groups have stronger ability to accumulate water layers than the ones terminated by groups of larger coordination number. Collectively, these efforts consolidate further the concept for structure-controlled reactivities in iron oxyhydroxides, and pave the way for new studies along such lines...|$|R
