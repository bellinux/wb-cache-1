5|$|Reconnaissance {{aircraft}} {{flew into}} Hurricane Alice on January 3 and confirmed {{the existence of}} the tropical cyclone by reporting winds between 60 and 65mph (95 to 105km/h) and a warm <b>core</b> <b>center.</b> It is estimated Alice continued to intensify as it tracked southwestward in the Caribbean Sea, and attained peak winds of 80mph (130km/h) while located about 95miles (150km) west-northwest of Montserrat. While near its peak the hurricane developed a ring of convection around its eye, and Alice maintained peak winds for about 24hours until cold air from the north weakened it. Extratropical cyclogenesis occurred north of Bermuda on January 3, which weakened the high pressure system to the north of Alice and turned the flow in the Caribbean Sea to that of cold northwesterly winds. Alice turned to the southeast on January 4 and weakened to a tropical storm shortly thereafter. Convection gradually became disorganized, and after weakening to a tropical depression on January 5, Alice dissipated on January 6 while located about 100miles (160km) west-northwest of Grenada.|$|E

2500|$|The other pathway, non-cyclic photophosphorylation, is a {{two-stage}} process involving {{two different}} chlorophyll photosystems. Being a light reaction, non-cyclic photophosphorylation {{occurs in the}} frets or stroma lamellae. First, a water molecule is broken down into 2H+ + 1/2 O2 + 2e− by a process called photolysis (or light-splitting). The two electrons from the water molecule are kept in photosystem II, while the 2H+ and 1/2O2 are left out for further use. Then a photon is absorbed by chlorophyll pigments surrounding the reaction <b>core</b> <b>center</b> of the photosystem. The light excites the electrons of each pigment, causing a chain reaction that eventually transfers energy {{to the core of}} photosystem II, exciting the two electrons that are transferred to the primary electron acceptor, pheophytin. The deficit of electrons is replenished by taking electrons from another molecule of water. The electrons transfer from pheophytin to plastoquinone, which takes the 2e− from Pheophytin, and two H+ atoms from the stroma and forms PQH2, which later is broken into PQ, the 2e− is released to Cytochrome b6f complex and the two H+ ions are released into thylakoid lumen. The electrons then pass through the Cyt b6 and Cyt f. Then they are passed to plastocyanin, [...] providing the energy for hydrogen ions (H+) to be pumped into the thylakoid space. This creates a gradient, making H+ ions flow back into the stroma of the chloroplast, providing the energy for the regeneration of ATP.|$|E
