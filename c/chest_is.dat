5|$|The third {{mechanism}} {{occurs when}} the <b>chest</b> <b>is</b> compressed from front to back, causing it to widen from side to side. The lungs adhere to the chest wall because of the negative pressure {{between them and the}} pleural membranes lining the inside of the chest cavity; thus when the chest widens, they are pulled apart. This creates tension at the carina; the airway tears if this tensile force exceeds its elasticity. This mechanism may be the cause of injury when the <b>chest</b> <b>is</b> crushed. Most TBI are probably due to a combination of these three mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|In COPD, it {{may take}} longer to breathe out than to breathe in. Chest {{tightness}} may occur but is not common and {{may be caused by}} another problem. Those with obstructed airflow may have wheezing or decreased sounds with air entry on examination of the chest with a stethoscope. A barrel <b>chest</b> <b>is</b> a characteristic sign of COPD, but is relatively uncommon. Tripod positioning may occur as the disease worsens.|$|E
5|$|In {{attempting}} {{to present the}} character as a figurative mirror to Batman, the costume worn by Anarky in Beware the Batman was radially redesigned as entirely white, in contrast to Batman's black Batsuit. It consists of a tightly worn jumpsuit, cape, hood, flexible mask with white-eye lenses, and a utility belt. Upon the <b>chest</b> <b>is</b> a small, stylized circle-A in black. The design was negatively compared by reviewers to the longstanding design for Moon Knight, a Marvel Comics superhero.|$|E

50|$|The valve <b>chests</b> <b>are</b> {{usually on}} top of the {{cylinders}} but, in older locomotives, the valve <b>chests</b> <b>were</b> sometimes located alongside the cylinders and inserted through slots in the frames. This meant that, while the cylinders were outside, the valves were inside and could be driven by inside valve gear.|$|R

5|$|Injuries to the tracheobronchial tree {{within the}} chest may occur due to {{penetrating}} forces such as gunshot wounds, but {{are more often}} the result of blunt trauma. TBI due blunt forces usually results from high-energy impacts such as falls from height and motor vehicle accidents; the injury is rare in low-impact mechanisms. Injuries of the trachea cause about 1% of traffic-related deaths. Other potential causes are falls from high places and injuries in which the <b>chest</b> <b>is</b> crushed. Explosions are another cause.|$|E
5|$|It {{has a long}} broad {{nose and}} muzzle, with thick ears covered in silky hair that usually end around {{the tip of the}} muzzle. Its <b>chest</b> <b>is</b> of medium size that descends down to the same level as the elbows. Both the {{forequarters}} and the hindquarters are well muscled. Its tail typically does not extend beyond the hock and is normally straight.|$|E
5|$|The second {{mechanism}} {{may occur}} when the <b>chest</b> <b>is</b> suddenly decelerated, as occurs in vehicle accidents, producing a shearing force. The lungs are mobile in the chest cavity but their movement is more restricted near the hilum. Areas near the cricoid cartilage and carina are fixed to the thyroid cartilage and the pericardium respectively; thus if the airways move, they can tear at these points of fixation.|$|E
50|$|Large cassoni (singular cassone), or {{marriage}} <b>chests,</b> <b>were</b> {{the most}} desired and common features of homes, {{and despite the}} fact that they were expensive, were bought by nearly all the social classes. Made with gesso and wood, these <b>chests</b> <b>were</b> often dark and elaborate, and their grandness depended on people's different classes (wealthier people had more sumptuous ones, whilst poorer classes' cassoni were often far simpler). The best decorators and sculptors in Italy often produced grand and beautiful cassoni for some of the most important noble families of the time. Even though these <b>chests</b> <b>were</b> used to put objects inside of them, many were used simply for decoration.|$|R
50|$|If the {{cylinders}} are small, the valve <b>chests</b> may <b>be</b> located between {{the cylinders}}. For larger cylinders the valve <b>chests</b> <b>are</b> usually {{on top of}} the cylinders but, in early locomotives, they were sometimes underneath the cylinders.|$|R
50|$|Move {{the left}} hand up {{to rest on the}} <b>chest,</b> <b>be</b> aware, and then stop.|$|R
5|$|Narrowing of the airways occurs due to {{inflammation}} and scarring within them. This {{contributes to the}} inability to breathe out fully. The greatest reduction in air flow occurs when breathing out, as the pressure in the <b>chest</b> <b>is</b> compressing the airways at this time. This can result in more air from the previous breath remaining within the lungs when the next breath is started, resulting {{in an increase in}} the total volume of air in the lungs at any given time, a process called hyperinflation or air trapping. Hyperinflation from exercise is linked to shortness of breath in COPD, as it is less comfortable to breathe in when the lungs are already partly full. Hyperinflation may also worsen during an exacerbation.|$|E
5|$|Several {{disorders}} {{affect the}} motility of food as it travels down the esophagus. This can cause difficult swallowing, called dysphagia, or painful swallowing, called odynophagia. Achalasia {{refers to a}} failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax properly, and generally develops later in life. This leads to progressive enlargement of the esophagus, and possibly eventual megaesophagus. A nutcracker esophagus refers to swallowing that can be extremely painful. Diffuse esophageal spasm is a spasm of the esophagus that can be one cause of chest pain. Such referred pain to the wall of the upper <b>chest</b> <b>is</b> quite common in esophageal conditions. Sclerosis of the esophagus, such as with systemic sclerosis or in CREST syndrome may cause hardening of the walls of the esophagus and interfere with peristalsis.|$|E
5|$|The font design {{featured}} on the front cover was created by Pizz, a graphic artist from Long Beach, who also designed album cover art for several other indie rock bands. The {{back side of the}} album features a painting by bassist Emery, depicting a topless woman looking at herself through a hand mirror. On her <b>chest</b> <b>is</b> a red heart surrounded by arrows, and below, her ribs protrude from her sides, possibly a reference to anorexia and body image issues, a major theme of the album and its successor Live Through This.|$|E

5|$|In Tortuga, Jack hires a new crew, {{including}} Elizabeth and Norrington. With Elizabeth's use of Jack's compass, {{they are}} able to locate the chest. All parties arrive on Isla Cruces, where the <b>chest</b> <b>is</b> buried, but a three-way sword fight breaks out between Jack, Will, and Norrington, who all want the heart for their respective goals: Jack wants to call off the Kraken, Will wants to rescue his father, and Norrington wants to regain his life as a Navy officer. In the chaos, Norrington secretly steals the heart and runs off pretending to lure away the Dutchmans crew. Jones attacks the Pearl with the Kraken, which devours most of the crew and destroys {{all but one of the}} Pearls lifeboats, but Jack, who briefly flees the battle, returns and wounds the Kraken with a net full of explosives.|$|E
5|$|In {{the context}} of the {{commercial}} dance industry, hip-hop (or new style hip-hop for dancers in France and Japan) is choreographed urban party dancing with studio technique added to it. From a technical aspect, it is characterized as hard-hitting involving flexibility and isolations—moving a specific body part independently from others. The feet are grounded, the <b>chest</b> <b>is</b> down, the posture is hunched, and the body is kept loose so that dancers can easily alternate between hitting the beat or moving through the beat. Like African dance, new style hip-hop is very rhythmic and involves a lot of footwork and radial movement of the hips. In addition, emphasis is placed on musicality—how sensitive your movements are to the music—and being able to freestyle (improvise). As long as dancers keep the foundational movements, they can add their own (free)style and have a performance that is still hip-hop.|$|E
5|$|Picard and an away team {{board the}} Stargazer, and he orders a chest of his {{belongings}} {{to be sent}} to the Enterprise. Hidden in the <b>chest</b> <b>is</b> an orb, which glows brighter as Bok activates it, causing Picard to be hit by a wave of pain. Dr. Crusher orders him back to the Enterprise. Data meanwhile finds a discrepancy in the Stargazers logs stating that the Ferengi were attacked under a flag of truce. Upon further investigation, Data and La Forge report to Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) that the logs were certainly faked. Dr. Crusher and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) discuss the Captain, and Wesley shows them some unusual activity from the Ferengi ship. They head to inform Riker to alert him to the signals, who is informed by the Enterprise computer that Picard has transported to the Stargazer.|$|E

5|$|The cardiac {{examination}} includes inspection, {{feeling the}} chest with the hands (palpation) and listening with a stethoscope (auscultation). It involves assessment of signs {{that may be}} visible on a person's hands (such as splinter haemorrhages), joints and other areas. A person's pulse is taken, usually at the radial artery near the wrist, {{in order to assess}} for the rhythm and strength of the pulse. The blood pressure is taken, using either a manual or automatic sphygmomanometer or using a more invasive measurement from within the artery. Any elevation of the jugular venous pulse is noted. A person's <b>chest</b> <b>is</b> felt for any transmitted vibrations from the heart, and then listened to with a stethoscope. A normal heart has two hearts sounds – additional heart sounds or heart murmurs may also be able to be heard and may point to disease. Additional tests may be conducted to assess a person's heart murmurs if they are present, and peripheral signs of heart disease such as swollen feet or fluid in the lungs may be assessed.|$|E
5|$|The head is {{long and}} strong, with a convex profile and thick, long ears. The neck {{is long and}} the {{shoulders}} are sloping. The <b>chest</b> <b>is</b> broad and deep, the withers prominent, the back long and broad, and the hindquarters strong. The legs are well developed and powerful, with large joints. The Poitevin has large hooves, an advantage in wet environments, as an adaptation to the alternately hard and waterlogged marshes upon which it developed. The lower legs are well feathered, and the mane and tail are long and thick. The Poitevin is gentle, calm and robust. Historically the breed {{has been known for}} its slow movement and disinterest in pulling, although it can produce significant power if necessary. The breed enjoys human contact, and shows intelligence, although it can also be stubborn. Prolonged effort is its weak point, as the Poitevin sometimes lack endurance.|$|E
5|$|With a stocky, {{powerful}} build, the Exmoor pony {{is strong}} for its height, and {{noted for its}} hardiness and endurance. The <b>chest</b> <b>is</b> deep and the back broad, the croup level. The legs are short, with good bone and hard hooves. Although many sources state that the Exmoor has a distinctly different jaw structure from other horse breeds, which includes the beginnings of development of a seventh molar, this is a misunderstanding based on an incorrect translation of a German study. The study, when properly translated, refers to a feature, found in multiple horse breeds and perhaps all animals with sizable lower jaws, {{that appears to be}} an extra branch of blood supply in the area. While an extra tooth may have eventually developed from this extra blood supply, its frequency among the general horse population makes its appearance in the Exmoor pony unremarkable.|$|E
40|$|The article makes a {{detailed}} study of two dated 16 th century <b>chests.</b> It <b>is</b> argued that the Thomas Silkstede chest now in Shanklin was made by French craftsmen in Winchester in 1519, whereas the Garstang <b>chest</b> <b>was</b> made in Cirencester in 1539. The carving of the former is in full 'first renaissance' style, whereas the latter has a mixture of gothic, heraldic and renaissance decorative features. The two <b>chests</b> <b>are</b> presented as illustrating the very slow arrival of renaissance influence on English furniture. Comparisons are made with other pieces of 16 th century English and French furnitur...|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the find}} {{had been placed}} in the <b>chest,</b> but there <b>were</b> also objects around it such as three bronze cauldrons, three bells and a fire-grid of iron. A chain, made up of 26 figure-of-eight shaped links, was wrapped around it. It served both as an extra lock and handle since the <b>chest</b> <b>was</b> too heavy for the {{original}} handle. The chest and the other items had probably been placed in a boat which capsized and sank in the lake. Another theory <b>is</b> that the <b>chest</b> <b>was</b> temporarily hidden at the water's edge.|$|R

5|$|The newly hatched American white ibis {{is covered}} with violet down feathers, {{deepening}} to dark brown or black {{on the head and}} wings. The <b>chest</b> <b>is</b> often bare and there can be a white tuft on the head. The irises are brown. The exposed skin is pinkish initially, apart from the tip of the bill which is dark gray, but turns gray within a few days of hatching. The bill is short and straight at birth and has an egg tooth which falls off between days five and nine, and develops three black rings from around day six, before turning gray by around six weeks of age. The gray to sandy gray brown juvenile plumage appears between weeks two and six, and face and bill become pink a few weeks later, while the legs remain gray. The irises have turned slate-gray by this stage. Once fledged, the juvenile American white ibis has largely brown plumage and only the rump, underwing and underparts are white. The legs become light orange. As it matures, white feathers begin appearing on the back and it undergoes a gradual molt to obtain the white adult plumage. This is mostly complete {{by the end of the}} second year, although some brown feathers persist on the head and neck until the end of the third year. Juvenile birds take around two years to reach adult size and weight.|$|E
