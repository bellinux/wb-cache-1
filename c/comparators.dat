2500|$|While {{in general}} <b>comparators</b> are [...] "fast," [...] their {{circuits}} {{are not immune}} to the classic speed-power tradeoff. High speed <b>comparators</b> use transistors with larger aspect ratios and hence also consume more power. Depending on the application, select either a comparator with high speed or one that saves power. For example, nano-powered <b>comparators</b> in space-saving chip-scale packages (UCSP), DFN or SC70 packages such as , , , [...] and [...] are ideal for ultra-low-power, portable applications. Likewise if a comparator is needed to implement a relaxation oscillator circuit to create a high speed clock signal then <b>comparators</b> having few nano seconds of propagation delay may be suitable.

Some <b>comparators</b> such as , , , [...] and [...] also provide the hysteresis control through a separate hysteresis pin. These <b>comparators</b> make it possible to add a programmable hysteresis without feedback or complicated equations. Using a dedicated hysteresis pin is also convenient if the source impedance is high since the inputs are isolated from the hysteresis network. When hysteresis is added then a comparator cannot resolve signals within the hysteresis band.|$|E

2500|$|Stanley Porter {{has also}} {{questioned}} Nongbri's assertion that valid comparisons {{can be made}} between 52 and documentary papyri of the later second and early third centuries; noting the warning from Eric Turner that, “Comparison of book hands with dated documentary hands will be less reliable, {{the intention of the}} scribe is different in the two cases.” and in respect of this Porter cautions against what he terms Nongbri's 'overly skeptical' insistence on disregarding <b>comparators</b> without an explicit date, forcing <b>comparators</b> for literary texts inappropriately to be confined to purely documentary hands. Porter suggests that Nongbri's proposed late second and third century <b>comparators</b> are in several cases quite different from 52 so that they force comparison to focus on detailed letter forms without consideration of the overall formation, trajectory and style of the script. If, rather than undertaking comparisons document by document, typological letter comparisons are instead applied using published series of dated representative script alphabets, then, Porter asserts, both 52 and P.Egerton 2 [...] "fit comfortably within the second century. There are of course some letters that are similar to those in the third century (as there are some in the first century) but the letters that tend to be given the most individualization, such as alpha, mu and even sigma, appear to be second century." [...] Both Porter and Nongbri note that Eric Turner, notwithstanding his proposal of P.Amh. 2.78 as a parallel for 52, nevertheless continued to maintain that [...] "The Rylands papyrus may therefore be accepted as {{of the first half of}} the second century".|$|E

2500|$|An {{altogether}} {{different approach to}} dating New Testament payri has been proposed {{by a number of}} paleographers in recent years, drawing on the notion of [...] "graphic stream" [...] developed by Guglielmo Cavallo. Rather than comparing letter forms of undated papyri directly with dated <b>comparators,</b> it is proposed that the hand in question should first be identified to a graphic stream representing the overall development of a particular handwriting style. [...] "The way that individual letters are formed within these graphic streams is secondary to the overall style of the script". [...] Don Barker, reviewing the proposed <b>comparators</b> and range of datings that have been advanced over the years for 52, maintains that this papyrus can be placed in a [...] "round block script" [...] graphic stream that is attested from the first century onwards; and notes eleven dated examples ranging from P.Oxy. 3466 (81-96 CE) to P.Oxy.3183 (292 CE) and including all the later parallels proposed by Nongbri and Turner as well as P.Fayum 110 (94 CE) from Roberts's original study. Otherwise, however, Barker rejects from this graphic stream all the other <b>comparators</b> proposed by Roberts and his correspondents, including P. Flor 1. 1 (153 CE). [...] Barker maintains that the letter formation within this the graphic stream [...] "appears to have great holding power", and proposes that it is consequently difficult to place 52 into a narrower time frame within it. [...] " [...] When the general style and individual letter features are kept in close connection and keeping in mind how a scribe writing a documentary text may write a literary text differently, it would seem from the above dated manuscripts, that a date of the second or third century could be assigned to P.Ryl. 457"." ...|$|E
