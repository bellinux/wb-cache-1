40|$|The cometary {{meteoroid}} ejection {{model of}} Jones and Brown (1996 b) {{was used to}} simulate ejection from comets 55 P/Tempel-Tuttle during the last 12 revolutions, and the last 9 apparitions of 109 P/Swift-Tuttle. Using cometary ephemerides generated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory s (JPL) HORIZONS Solar System Data and Ephemeris Computation Service, two independent ejection schemes were simulated. In the first case, ejection was simulated in 1 hour time steps along the <b>comet</b> <b>s</b> <b>orbit</b> while it was within 2. 5 AU of the Sun. In the second case, ejection was simulated to occur at the hour the comet reached perihelion. A 4 th order variable step-size Runge-Kutta integrator was then used to integrate meteoroid position and velocity forward in time, accounting {{for the effects of}} radiation pressure, Poynting-Robertson drag, and the gravitational forces of the planets, which were computed using JPL s DE 406 planetary ephemerides. An impact parameter was computed for each particle approaching the Earth to create a flux profile, and the results compared to observations of the 1998 and 1999 Leonid showers, and the 1993 and 2004 Perseids...|$|E
