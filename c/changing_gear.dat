500|$|The {{recording}} {{begins with}} Harrison's guitar riff, {{which is then}} joined by Clapton's guitar, played through a wah-wah pedal. Leng suggests that the musical arrangement {{was influenced by the}} Delaney & Bonnie song [...] "Comin' Home", following Clapton and Harrison's guest roles on the band's European tour in December 1969. [...] "Wah-Wah" [...] also features prominent percussion, including uncredited maracas and congas, and, in Leng's description, a [...] "rollicking horn chart" [...] from Price that helps define the middle-eight sections. Adding to the musical tension, Janovitz notes, Harrison sings high in his range throughout, [...] "almost drowned out" [...] by Spector's Wall of Sound, which sees keyboards, horns and the many guitar parts competing for space in the mix. The song fades out on the single-chord main riff, accompanied by the sound of a car engine <b>changing</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E
50|$|For the Paris Motor Show in October 1957 the {{manufacture}} offered, at extra cost, an electro-magnetic Jaeger automatic clutch, activated when <b>changing</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E
5000|$|An [...] "{{electronic}} gear-shifting system" [...] is {{a method}} of <b>changing</b> <b>gears,</b> which enables riders to shift with electronic switches instead of using conventional control levers. The switches are connected by wire or wirelessly to a battery pack and to a small electric motor that drives the derailleur. Although expensive, an electronic system could save a racing cyclist time when <b>changing</b> <b>gears.</b>|$|R
50|$|Elliptical bicycle gears make {{it easier}} for the chain to slide off the cog when <b>changing</b> <b>gears.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is {{sometimes}} possible to select no <b>gear</b> when <b>changing</b> <b>gears</b> with a poorly adjusted gear cable, {{which results in}} a complete loss of drive.|$|R

5000|$|In some {{machines}} (e.g., automobiles) it {{is necessary}} to alter the gear ratio to suit the task, a process known as gear shifting or <b>changing</b> <b>gear.</b> There are several ways of shifting gears, for example: ...|$|E
50|$|Twice in its history, {{internal}} scale {{factors were}} changed, presumably by <b>changing</b> <b>gear</b> ratios. Target speed {{had a hard}} upper limit, set by a mechanical stop. It was originally 300 knots, and subsequently doubled in each rebuild.|$|E
5000|$|Float {{shifting}} or floating gears, {{also called}} [...] "slip shifting" [...] or [...] "dead sticking", {{is the process}} of <b>changing</b> <b>gears,</b> typically in a non-synchronous transmission, without depressing the clutch.|$|R
50|$|Non-synchronous {{transmissions}} {{are designed}} to depend upon an operator experienced in <b>changing</b> <b>gears.</b> The operators must understand how to shift the transmission {{into and out of}} gear. Many learn how to do this in certifying schools.|$|R
5000|$|Progressive {{shifting}} is {{a technique}} for <b>changing</b> <b>gears</b> commonly practiced by drivers of semi-trailer trucks. It is meant {{to reduce fuel consumption}} [...] - [...] something very important for drivers who travel several hundred miles each day.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Changing</b> <b>gear</b> {{involved}} a column-mounted gear change, which by now was becoming increasingly mainstream in Germany. It {{was possible to}} specify a [...] "Saxomat" [...] automatic clutch with the three-speed transmission,: drivers content to accept a fully manual gear change system could also specify a four-speed gear box.|$|E
50|$|In October 1956 Daimler Conquest Century buyers {{were offered}} {{the choice of}} an {{automatic}} transmission or the traditional preselector system. Time was <b>changing</b> <b>gear.</b> Preselector gearboxes faded away as modern automatic transmissions took their place. Currency restrictions had meant that until Borg-Warner built a British plant automatic transmissions were only available on export cars.|$|E
50|$|Transmission is {{a choice}} of either three-speed {{automatic}} or six-speed sequential gearbox. The three-speed TH400 gearbox predates the Baja 1000 but remains popular amongst competitors due to the long gear ratios and capability of handling the torque spikes caused by off-road racing. The six-speed sequential gearbox appeals to competitors due to the ease of <b>changing</b> <b>gear</b> ratios quickly.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Changing</b> <b>gears</b> in {{an average}} car, {{especially}} with a foot-operated clutch, offers well-known examples: although the accelerating force is limited by engine power, an inexperienced driver lets you experience severe jerk, just because of intermittent force closure over the clutch.|$|R
50|$|Wheelspin {{can also}} occur when <b>changing</b> <b>gears</b> while {{the vehicle is}} in motion, as the inertia of the engine and {{flywheel}} rotating {{at a higher rate}} than the next highest gear tries to bring the input shaft of the transmission to the same speed.|$|R
30|$|<b>Changing</b> of <b>gear</b> ratios {{should be}} swift.|$|R
50|$|Selespeed {{was first}} {{introduced}} in 1999 in the Alfa Romeo 156. At {{that time it was}} the first car in its class with such a robotized gearbox. This first version had buttons on the steering wheel for <b>changing</b> <b>gear.</b> With the facelift of the 156 in 2002 these buttons were replaced by paddle shifters (first seen in the Alfa Romeo 147) due to a new steering wheel design.|$|E
5000|$|Boots [...] - [...] Especially {{those for}} sport riding, include {{reinforcement}} and plastic caps on the ankles, and toe area. Boots designed for cruiser-style riders often have steel-reinforced toes (however this reduces {{sensitivity of the}} foot when <b>changing</b> <b>gear).</b> Boots should always have a rubber sole (as opposed to leather or other less flexible materials). Despite their toughness and protection, most boots are very lightweight. Some even include titanium plating.|$|E
50|$|Following Le Mans, the DP215 {{appeared}} at the 12 Hours of Reims (a race accompanying the French GP), driven by Jo Schlesser. The car should have won easily, due to no serious opposition in the field. But after leading, Schlesser was having more trouble with the repaired CG537 transmission. Having difficulty <b>changing</b> <b>gear,</b> and missing gears, which caused over-revving of the engine, leading to bending all the valves, forcing the car to retire on lap 4.|$|E

5000|$|Lloyd founded Quite Interesting Limited in 1999. It {{is claimed}} {{that the idea of}} {{founding}} the company came on Christmas Eve 1993. According to his profile on QI.com, [...] "he came to the sudden and alarming realisation that he didn't really know anything. <b>Changing</b> <b>gear</b> again, he started reading books {{for the first time since}} he was 17. To his horror, he discovered that he hadn't been paying attention and, with painful slowness, unearthed the closely guarded secret that the universe is astoundingly quite interesting." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{successor}} model, the Brennabor Typ PW, {{appeared in}} 1925. This shared the 2.1-litre {{engine of the}} earlier Typ P, but claimed maximum power was increased to 32 hp, achieved, now, at 2,600 rpm. The gear lever was relocated from the right hand edge {{of the car to}} a central floor-mounted position, which necessitated <b>changing</b> <b>gear</b> with the left hand, since the driver continued to be conventionally positioned on the right-hand side of the car. The wheelbase was unchanged, but the standard bodies were nevertheless a little longer than on the previous model.|$|E
50|$|Barrichello overtook Zanardi on lap 26; Salo did {{the same}} {{at the start of}} lap 28. At this point, Häkkinen led Frentzen by eight seconds, with Schumacher a further two-and-a-half seconds back. But on lap 30, going into the Rettifilo, Häkkinen made a mistake <b>changing</b> <b>gear</b> - {{selecting}} first instead of second - and spun off, in a virtual repeat of his unforced error at San Marino earlier in the year. In a rare show of emotion, the Finn burst into tears {{at the side of the}} track.|$|E
50|$|Float {{shifting}} or floating <b>gears</b> is <b>changing</b> <b>gears</b> without depressing the clutch, {{usually on}} a non-synchronized transmission. Since the clutch is not used, {{it is easy}} to mismatch speeds of gears, and the driver can quickly cause major (and expensive) damage to the gears and the transmission. Float shifting is often done on large trucks with standard (non-synchronized) gearboxes.|$|R
5000|$|Progressive {{shifting}} {{is accomplished}} by <b>changing</b> <b>gears</b> upward {{as early as possible}} when accelerating, while staying within the torque range. Each shift will go a little higher into the RPM, until the vehicle is in its top gear at cruising speed. After each shift is completed, the engine and transmission should be operating at or near the lowest rpm speeds recommended by the manufacturers of those parts.|$|R
25|$|One {{solution}} to the steering problem is to use two separate drivetrains, each driving one track. Steering is accomplished by <b>changing</b> <b>gears</b> on one and not the other. This maintains power to both tracks while steering, produces {{a wide range of}} turning circles, and even allows one track to be reversed while the other moves forward, allowing the tank to turn in place. This may be combined with brakes to further control the steering radius.|$|R
50|$|Ferrari's first {{automated}} gearbox in a {{road car}} (used them previously in their Formula One cars since 1989) {{went on sale}} in 1993 in the Ferrari Mondial; the Mondial Valeo retained the traditional gated shifter, but removed the clutch pedal. Four years later, a paddle-shifted transmission arrived in the 1997 Ferrari F355. The most recent version of its semi-automatic {{was introduced in the}} Ferrari 599 GTO which was capable of <b>changing</b> <b>gear</b> in 60 ms. In the new Ferrari California & Ferrari 458 Italia, Ferrari has opted to use a double-clutch transmission.|$|E
50|$|This {{arrangement}} is also sometimes {{known as a}} direct shift gearbox or powershift gearbox. It seeks to combine the advantages of a conventional manual shift with the qualities of a modern automatic transmission by providing different clutches for odd and even speed selector gears. When <b>changing</b> <b>gear,</b> the engine torque is transferred from one gear to the other continuously, so providing gentle, smooth gear changes without either losing power or jerking the vehicle. Gear selection may be manual, automatic (depending on throttle/speed sensors), or a 'sports' version combining both options.|$|E
5000|$|The Times {{correspondent}} {{reported that}} the engine pulls strongly and quickly lifts vehicle speed. Though not as quiet as a side-valve it sounds and feels efficient. The change speed lever was a little stiff and vague in action. A slight pause is necessary when <b>changing</b> <b>gear</b> to allow the syncromesh to do its job. The brakes proved effective though they pulled towards the nearside. The drivers position is excellent. [...] "The accelerator might be cranked {{a little more to}} the right for the benefit of a large and heavy-footed driver". A comfortable top speed (in poor gusty weather) was 60 mph.|$|E
50|$|In racing, short {{shifting}} is {{a technique}} intended to avoid losing valuable acceleration time <b>changing</b> <b>gears</b> later. Although this means {{not being able to}} accelerate using the engine's peak power at the moment of the gear change, total acceleration over time may be greater as no acceleration can happen during the gear change. This can aid overtaking by ensuring that the car is in the right gear in anticipation of a manoeuvre.|$|R

50|$|Breeding {{season is}} from early spring through to late summer. The male's mating call {{sounds like a}} {{motorbike}} <b>changing</b> <b>gears.</b> The males usually find a suitable clump of reeds or other water plants from which to call. When a female joins the male in the water, the male grips onto the female’s back, using his nuptial pads, that appear during breeding season. Large clumps of eggs, encased in a transparent jelly, are attached to floating vegetation and debris.|$|R
