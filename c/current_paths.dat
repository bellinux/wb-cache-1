25|$|A key {{advantage}} of every film capacitor's internal construction is direct contact to the electrodes {{on both ends}} of the winding. This contact keeps all <b>current</b> <b>paths</b> very short. The design behaves like a large number of individual capacitors connected in parallel, thus reducing the internal ohmic losses (ESR) and ESL. The inherent geometry of film capacitor structure results in low ohmic losses and a low parasitic inductance, which makes them suitable for applications with high surge currents (snubbers) and for AC power applications, or for applications at higher frequencies.|$|E

25|$|Although {{covered in}} {{industry}} technical standards, {{there is still}} some disagreement on the best way to handle the use of pin 1 for grounding (earthing). The main controversy is whether the shell of the connector should be connected to pin 1 or the shield, or left floating. AES standards mentioned above recommend that shells of cable-mounted connectors should never be connected to pin 1 or the shield, because inadvertent contact of the shell with another grounded surface while in use can create unwanted <b>current</b> <b>paths</b> for fault current, potentially causing hum and other noise. On the other hand, equipment containing active circuitry should always have pin 1 connected to the conductive enclosure of the equipment {{as close as possible to}} the point where the signal enters the enclosure. The argument centers on the radio frequency shielding provided by the shell of the connector, which may be reduced if it is left floating. An alternative solution is to connect the shell to pin 1 and the shield through a small value capacitor, providing RF shielding but allowing very little audio-frequency current to flow. This capability can be built into a fixed jack or a cable terminated with XLR connectors.|$|E

2500|$|The {{number of}} poles {{represents}} the number of conductors that are interrupted when a fault condition occurs. [...] RCDs used on single-phase AC supplies (two <b>current</b> <b>paths),</b> such as domestic power, are usually one- or two-pole designs, also known as single- and double-pole. A single-pole RCD interrupts only the energized conductor, while a double-pole RCD interrupts both the energized and return conductors. (In a single-pole RCD, the return conductor is usually anticipated to be at ground potential at all times and therefore safe on its own, however see limitations below).|$|E

2500|$|Analog meters {{can measure}} {{voltage and current}} by using power from the test circuit, but require a {{supplementary}} internal voltage source for resistance testing, while electronic meters always require an internal power supply to run their internal circuitry. [...] Hand-held meters use batteries, while bench meters usually use mains power; either arrangement allows the meter to test devices. Testing often requires that the component under test be isolated from the circuit {{in which they are}} mounted, as otherwise stray or leakage <b>current</b> <b>paths</b> may distort measurements. [...] In some cases, the voltage from the multimeter may turn active devices on, distorting a measurement, or in extreme cases even damage an element in the circuit being investigated.|$|E
2500|$|A {{catastrophic failure}} occurs from not {{successfully}} limiting {{a very large}} surge from an event like a lightning strike, where the energy involved is many orders of magnitude greater than the varistor can handle. Follow-through current resulting from a strike may melt, burn, or even vaporize the varistor. [...] This thermal runaway {{is due to a}} lack of conformity in individual grain-boundary junctions, which leads to the failure of dominant <b>current</b> <b>paths</b> under thermal stress when the energy in a transient pulse (normally measured in joules) is too high (i.e. significantly exceeds the manufacture's [...] "Absolute Maximum Ratings"). The probability of catastrophic failure can be reduced by increasing the rating, or using specially selected MOVs in parallel.|$|E

50|$|The {{basic idea}} is that a dielectric, which is {{normally}} insulating, {{can be made to}} conduct through a filament or conduction path formed after application of a sufficiently high voltage. The conduction path can arise from different mechanisms, including vacancy or metal defect migration. Once the filament is formed, it may be reset (broken, resulting in high resistance) or set (re-formed, resulting in lower resistance) by another voltage. Many <b>current</b> <b>paths,</b> rather than a single filament, are possibly involved. The presence of these <b>current</b> <b>paths</b> in the dielectric can be in situ demonstrated via conductive atomic force microscopy.|$|E
