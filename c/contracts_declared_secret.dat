Clyde performed relatively well during wartime football in both league and cup football.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Objective: To analyse the {{personal}} and occupational factors associated with the prevalence and duration of sickness benefit claims due to synovitis and tenosynovitis (CID 10 M 65). Methods: Cross-sectional study regarding sickness benefit claims due to synovitis and tenosynovitis granted to employees by National Institute of Social Security in Brazil in 2008. Data on economic activity (Economic Activities National Classification – CNAE division, class), sex, age, type and duration of benefits were collected from the Unified Benefit System.

50|$|By January 1989 the Commission {{obtained}} legal opinions {{from two}} Queen's Counsel. Although {{they did not}} agree, the commission preferred the opinion which made it ultra vires for councils to engage in interest rate swaps. Moreover, interest rates had increased from 8% to 15%. The auditor and the commission then went to court and had the <b>contracts</b> <b>declared</b> illegal (appeals {{all the way up}} to the House of Lords failed in Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham LBC); the five banks involved lost millions of pounds. Many other local authorities had been engaging in interest rate swaps in the 1980s.

40|$|Abstract. We {{previously}} {{developed a}} component-oriented model that combines ideas from self-organizing architectures and from design by contract {{to address the}} complexity of design in multi-threaded systems. Components in our model are cohesive collections of objects that publish <b>contracts</b> <b>declaring</b> {{the conditions under which}} they access other components. These contracts localize a component’s contextual synchronization dependencies in its interface. Moreover, the resulting systems permit strong guarantees of safety. This paper reports a case study to validate the efficacy of our model on a realistic design problem: the component-based design of a multi-threaded web server. We first developed a bare-bones web server based on the Apache architecture and then subjected this design to three extension tasks. The study corroborates that our model enables a fine-grain component-based design of multi-threaded applications of realistic complexity, while guaranteeing freedom from certain synchronization errors. ...|$|R

50|$|The Freistuhl was {{the place}} of session, and was usually a hillock, or some other {{well-known}} and accessible spot. The Freigraf and the Schöffen (judges) occupied the bench, before which a table, with a sword and rope upon it, was placed. The court was held by day and, unless the session was <b>declared</b> <b>secret,</b> all freemen, whether initiated or not, were admitted. The accusation was in the old German form; but only a Freischöffe could act as accuser. If the offence came under the competence of the court, meaning it was punishable by death, a summons to the accused was issued under the seal of the Freigraf. This was not usually served on him personally, but was nailed to his door, or to some convenient place where he was certain to pass. Six weeks and three days' grace were allowed, according to the old Saxon law, and the summons was thrice repeated. If the accused appeared, the accuser stated the case, and the investigation proceeded by the examination of witnesses as in an ordinary court of law. The judgment was put into execution on the spot if that was possible.|$|R
