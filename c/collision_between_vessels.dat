60|$|It {{was from}} Henrietta Stackpole that she learned how Caspar Goodwood {{had come to}} Rome; an event that took place three days after Lord Warburton's departure. This latter fact had been preceded by an {{incident}} of some importance to Isabel--the temporary absence, once again, of Madame Merle, {{who had gone to}} Naples to stay with a friend, the happy possessor of a villa at Posilippo. Madame Merle had ceased to minister to Isabel's happiness, who found herself wondering whether the most discreet of women might not also by chance be the most dangerous. Sometimes, at night, she had strange visions; she seemed to see her husband and her friend--his friend--in dim, indistinguishable combination. It seemed to her that she had not done with her; this lady had something in reserve. Isabel's imagination applied itself actively to this elusive point, but every now and then it was checked by a nameless dread, so that when the charming woman was away from Rome she had almost a consciousness of respite. She had already learned from Miss Stackpole that Caspar Goodwood was in Europe, Henrietta having written to make it known to her immediately after meeting him in Paris. He himself never wrote to Isabel, and though he was in Europe she thought it very possible he might not desire to see her. Their last interview, before her marriage, had had quite the character of a complete rupture; if she remembered rightly he had said he wished to take his last look at her. Since then he had been the most discordant survival of her earlier time--the only one in fact with which a permanent pain was associated. He had left her that morning with a sense of the most superfluous of shocks: it was like a <b>collision</b> <b>between</b> <b>vessels</b> in broad daylight. There had been no mist, no hidden current to excuse it, and she herself had only wished to steer wide. He had bumped against her prow, however, while her hand was on the tiller, and--to complete the metaphor--had given the lighter vessel a strain which still occasionally betrayed itself in a faint creaking. It had been horrid to see him, because he represented the only serious harm that (to her belief) she had ever done in the world: he was the only person with an unsatisfied claim on her. She had made him unhappy, she couldn't help it; and his unhappiness was a grim reality. She had cried with rage, after he had left her, at--she hardly knew what: she tried to think it had been at his want of consideration. He had come to her with his unhappiness when her own bliss was so perfect; he had done his best to darken the brightness of those pure rays. He had not been violent, and yet there had been a violence in the impression. There had been a violence at any rate in something somewhere; perhaps it was only in her own fit of weeping and in that after-sense of the same which had lasted three or four days.|$|E

Acollision between ships could end in loss of life of passengers as well as significanteconomic losses and has very {{negative impact on the}} environment, especially if thevessels carry any chemicals or any other harmful materials that could be dangerousfor marine life.

40|$|Whale {{watching}} is {{an international}} industry worth more than US$ 2 billion globally and is currently the greatest economic activity reliant upon cetaceans. However, there is concern that whale watching is detrimental to the target species. Numerous {{studies have shown that}} cetaceans exhibit behavioral changes in response to whale-watching boat traffic. Some of these behavioral changes involve inhibiting biologically important behaviors such as feeding and resting. There is convincing evidence for some species that these can translate into population-level effects such as reduced reproductive rates. Whale watching can also cause direct mortality through <b>collisions</b> <b>between</b> <b>vessels</b> and animals. The introduction of guidelines or regulations for whale watching has been the most common method of trying to mitigate the impacts of boat-based whale watching. However, there is great variety in the comprehensiveness of guidelines, and even if operators have guidelines, compliance with them can be poor. Compliance might be improved if guidelines have legal under-pinnings, with monitoring and enforcement or via pressure to comply by other operators and whale-watching tourists. Simple guidelines may be more easily complied with that ones requiring specialist knowledge. Likewise undertaking simple measures, such as establishing temporal or spatial “refuges” protecting biologically important areas (e. g., feeding grounds) where whale-watching activity is prohibited, could be an appropriate mitigation strategy...|$|R

40|$|In {{the light}} of {{maritime}} risk assessment it is desirable {{to be able to}} quantitatively determine the maritime <b>collision</b> probability <b>between</b> <b>vessels</b> underway in restricted waterways. At present no method exists with which this can be done with sufficient accuracy. A generally accepted qualitative approach is to simulate vessel traffic using a maritime traffic simulation program. Each vessel is assigned a vessel safety domain. The undesirable overlap of two vessel safety domains is called an encounter. During a simulation run, the maritime traffic simulation program counts the number of encounters. This number can be used to compare the relative safety of different alternative designs. It cannot be used to quantify the collision probability as the relationship between an encounter and the collision probability is yet unknown. An important disadvantage of this encounter method is the fact that no universal definition exists for these vessel safety domains and their dimensions in restricted waters. The aim of this graduation research was to obtain more insight into the <b>collision</b> probability <b>between</b> <b>vessels</b> underway in restricted waters, especially the factors that influence this probability. Three studies were carried out to this end. The first of these was a statistical investigation of two maritime incident databases. From both data sources it appeared that the vessel type and assumed collision cause had the clearest influence on the <b>collision</b> probability <b>between</b> <b>vessels.</b> Human errors were found to be the most frequent cause of incidents in both incident databases. The second study consisted of an investigation into maritime traffic in the Port of London area. The aim of this investigation was to learn which factors have the greatest influence on the Closest Point of Approach (CPA) <b>between</b> <b>vessels</b> underway in restricted waters. No relationships were found between the CPA and the vessel type, vessel dimensions and vessel speed. It was observed that the method of vessel safety domains for defining encounter situations is not capable of taking into account the fact that in restricted waters, vessels are frequently required to navigate close to one another without necessarily creating a hazardous situation. Finally, the reliability of the maritime traffic simulation program MARTRAM was evaluated. The MARTRAM simulation results for the Port of London area were compared to the original traffic data. It appeared that significantly more encounters occurred in the simulation than in reality. This difference was caused by the limited ability of MARTRAM to model human encounter avoidance behaviour. A large variation was apparent in the number of encounters that occurred during the different simulation runs. Therefore {{it was not possible to}} identify a single ratio between the number of real encounters and the number of MARTRAM encounters. These results confirm that MARTRAM is not suitable for the quantitative analysis of maritime safety. But MARTRAM can be used for the relative analysis of maritime safety.

SA is defined as ‘being aware of what is happening around you and understanding what that information means to you now and in the future’ (Endsley, 2012, p. 13). The first part of the study contains an analysis of accident reports that reveals that the collisions with offshore facilities were preceded by loss of SA on the bridge in 18 of the 23 instances. Three types of SA errors were identified: failure to perceive the situation correctly (Level 1 SA; n = 13), failure to comprehend the situ- ation (Level 2 SA; n = 4), and failure to project the situation into the future (Level 3 SA; n = 1). In the sec- ond part of the study, the human, technological and organisational factors described in the accident reports are analysed to evaluate how the factors may have affected the duty officers‘ awareness of the situation.
