5|$|Because it {{is lighter}} than air, {{airships}} and balloons are inflated with helium for lift. While hydrogen gas is more buoyant, and escapes permeating through a membrane {{at a lower}} rate, helium {{has the advantage of}} being non-flammable, and indeed fire-retardant. Another minor use is in rocketry, where helium is used as an ullage medium to displace fuel and oxidizers in storage tanks and to condense hydrogen and oxygen to make rocket fuel. It is also used to purge fuel and oxidizer from ground support equipment prior to launch and to pre-cool liquid hydrogen in space vehicles. For example, the Saturn V rocket used in the Apollo program needed about 370,000m3 (13 million <b>cubic</b> <b>feet)</b> <b>of</b> helium to launch.|$|E
5|$|Myers made {{passenger}} balloons for the St. Louis Fair in 1904. He was {{the superintendent}} of the Aeronautic Concourse of the St. Louis World's Fair. He {{was one of the}} managers in charge of a purse of $200,000 prize money for various balloon tournaments and races. He pointed out that building airships was very expensive and took knowledge of advanced balloon techniques that basically nobody in America had. Myers used as an example, to win the $20,000 prize of the Aero Club the French balloonist Alberto Santos-Dumont spent more than that amount in six airships he entered into the tournament to win. Myers himself had an over abundance of ideas for balloons, but was short on cash to make many of them a reality even though he had the necessary balloon knowledge. The newspapers printed that Myers was making a balloon capable of holding 75,000 to 100,000 <b>cubic</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Raphel was {{instrumental}} in coordinating the State Department's establishment of diplomatic relations with the Taliban shortly after its takeover of Kabul. A senior Unocal executive commented that the pipeline project would be far easier to implement with the Taliban in control, {{in reference to the}} need for central control in Afghanistan to undertake a project of the size, complexity and cost the Texas-based oil giant was considering. Unocal's consortium also included Saudi Arabia's Delta Oil, Pakistan's Crescent Group and Gazprom of Russia. The project involved building an 890-kilometer gas pipeline that would carry 1.9 billion <b>cubic</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> gas to Pakistan each day. Unocal held detailed discussions with Taliban representatives in Houston in December 1997, striking a deal that would later collapse under the weight of rising U.S. and Afghan domestic political pressures against the Taliban's record on human rights, education and treatment of women.|$|E

5|$|Jordan aims {{to benefit}} from its large uranium {{reserves}} with two nuclear plants, 1000 MW each, scheduled for completion in 2025. Natural gas was discovered in Jordan in 1987. The estimated size of the reserve discovered was about 230 billion cubic feet, a modest quantity compared with its other Arab neighbours. The Risha field, in the eastern desert beside the Iraqi border, produces nearly 35 million <b>cubic</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> gas a day, which is sent to a nearby power plant to produce a minimal amount of Jordan's electricity needs. Jordan receives 330 days of sunshine per year, and wind speeds reach over 7m/s in the mountainous areas. King Abdullah inaugurated several large-scale projects like the 117 MW Tafila Wind Farm and the 53 MW Shams Ma'an Power Plant in the 2010s. In May 2017, {{it was announced that}} more than 200 MW of solar energy projects had been completed. The government has set a target to satisfy 20% of Jordan's electrical consumption with renewable resources by 2020, a total of around 1800 MW.|$|E

Locks (at 95 x 11 x 6 feet, means 6,270 <b>cubic</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> water per lock) consume 72,240 cubic feet for 12 locks (about 23 times more water) and would take 96 minutes.|$|E

25|$|The East Ohio Gas Company built a {{full-scale}} commercial {{liquid natural gas}} (LNG) plant in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1940 just after a successful pilot plant built by its sister company, Hope Natural Gas Company of West Virginia. This was the first such plant in the world. Originally it had three spheres, approximately 63 feet in diameter containing LNG at −260°F. Each sphere held {{the equivalent of about}} 50 million <b>cubic</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> natural gas. A fourth tank, a cylinder, was added in 1942. It had an equivalent capacity of 100 million <b>cubic</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> gas. The plant operated successfully for three years. The stored gas was regasified and put into the mains when cold snaps hit and extra capacity was needed. This precluded the denial of gas to some customers during a cold snap.|$|E
