40|$|Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) {{are formed}} jointly with {{numerous}} products of incomplete combustion during waste incineration. Chlorobenzenes (CBz) are {{often cited as}} surrogates or precursors of PCDD/Fs. Experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of some key parameters on CBz formation, including moisture (H 2 O), chlorine gas (Cl 2), cupric chloride (CuCl 2), urea [(NH 2) 2 CO], ammonia (NH 3), and ammonium sulfate [(NH 4) 2 SO 4]. Cl 2 and CuCl 2 promoted CBz formation from fly ash, increasing the chlorination degree. In addition, Cl in <b>cupric</b> <b>compound</b> was more active than chlorine atom of Cl 2, and chlorine type significantly affected the chlorination process. Less CBz yield was detected after S- and N-containing compounds [(NH 2) 2 CO, NH 3, and (NH 4) 2 SO 4] were added into reactive ash. High content of moisture in gas prevented CBz synthesis and reduced chlorination. These experimental results are useful to optimize CBz emission control and realize the mechanism of the correlation between CBz and PCDD/Fs...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that some aromatic substances synthesized by plants serve as plant defense mechanisms. However, natural extracts are difficult to use due to their poor physicochemical characteristics and low concentration. Biocompatible microparticles for the delivery of the model antimicrobial compound Gallic acid (GA) were prepared by spray drying technique using hydroxylpropyl-methylcellulose-phtalate (HPMCP) and ethyl cellulose. The selection of appropriate experimental parameters allowed the obtaining of the following instrumental settings: (a) feed rate of the polymer solution 0. 6 ml/min, (b) air flow rate of the nebulization device 600 l/h, © flow of drying air 28 m 3 /h and (d) air drying temperature 90 C. Optical and electron microscopies showed micro particles characterized by acceptable morphology and narrow dimensional distribution. In vivo tests carried out in greenhouse tomato plants, cv. Pullrex Bio, contaminated with a bacterial suspension of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (106 CFU/ml), demonstrated that HPMCP-GA microparticles were able to significantly reduce the Pst epiphytic population showing an activity comparable to that obtained by copper salts. Biocompatible spray-dried microparticles with good activity were obtained and allowed the formulation of innovative products useful to reduce phytotoxicity and risk of copper resistance in plant pathogens associated with the frequent agricultural use of <b>cupric</b> <b>compounds...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract only availableMany {{researchers}} {{are working on}} understanding self-assembling macromolecules, in order to imitate and understand nature, especially after recognizing how many complex proteins and viruses are self-aggregating. Recently, the Atwood Group has self-assembled a nanocapsule not only capable of carrying cargo in its interior space, but should also be stable in water. This large neutral discrete pseudo-spherical coordination capsule is assembled from six pyrogallol[4]arene ligands and 24 copper(II) metal ions. The potential applications of this new material to bioanalytical chemistry, such as drug delivery, are enormous. Therefore, the ability to locate the nanocapsule in materials such as cells becomes imperative. The attachment of fluorescent molecules to the capsule surface is one experimental approach to this problem. The intrinsic fluorescence would facilitate the tracking of the actual nanocapsule assembly through various media. The purpose of the research project was to screen potential fluorophores for their suitability for attachment to the metal-coordinated nanocapsule surface. Therefore, a chemical moiety representing the attachment site of the larger structure was utilized. More specifically, catechol in methanol was reacted {{with a series of}} <b>cupric</b> <b>compounds,</b> such as anhydrous copper (II) sulfate and water, in a 2 : 1 ratio, respectively. Those solutions that formed a crystalline capsule moiety where further purified and reacted with fluorophores, such as phenol blue and pyrene butyric acid, containing the chemical entities, such as alcohols, amines, and carboxylic acids that would potentially coordinate to the metal site. Additional crystals produced at this step where then characterized via typical solid-state spectroscopic techniques...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial apical {{necrosis}} is {{a critical}} disease in the main production area of mango in Europe. It is caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, and produces necrotic lesions on mango buds and leaves, causing severe yield losses due to a decrease of flowering and fruit set. A field study to evaluate control treatments against bacterial apical necrosis was carried out during three seasons on mango trees cv. Tommy Atkins in Huelva (Spain). Experimental treatments included Bordeaux mixture, fosetyl-Al, acibenzolar-s-methyl, gibberelic acid, silicon gel, a mixture between acibenzolar-S-methyl and Bordeaux mixture, and combined applications of fosetyl-Al with Bordeaux mixture or silicon gel. The treatments which caused a consistent reduction in bacterial apical necrosis symptoms at similar levels to the conventional treatment with Bordeaux mixture, were the plant resistance activator acibenzolar-S-methyl and the phosphonate derivative fosetyl-Al applied singly or {{in combination with other}} compounds, which could be alternative treatments. These treatments showed a significant decrease in the necrotic buds and/or leaves numbers; however, minor differences in P. syringae-like population levels were observed. The analysis of the inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of <b>cupric</b> <b>compounds</b> against P. syringae strains isolated from mango tissues suggests that the commercial copper-based treatments with Bordeaux mixture used in the management of mango crops do not work in a bactericidal mode of action.
