50|$|Call {{tracking}} software records {{information about}} incoming telephone calls, {{and in some}} regions even the conversation. Call tracking is a technology which can enable the pay per <b>call,</b> <b>pay</b> per minute or pay per lead business model, allowing the tracking of phone calls {{to be associated with}} performance-based advertising such as Google AdWords, SEO Services, Display and Electronic Direct Marketing, and supplying additional analytic information about the phone calls themselves.Call tracking is a method of performance review for advertising and/or staff. It is based on the technological possibility of measuring the behavior of callers and is thus the equivalent in telephony to the conversion tracking used on the internet. Via different channels, both procedures offer the opportunity of clearly assigning a customer response to a specific advertising medium.|$|E

Internet search programs now allow users to create, upload, and use their own vertical search engines. Users may search within websites and use feeds, such as from particular newspapers. Local search refers {{to the ability to}} recall past search entries. A business can incorporate such valuable tools as ‘click to call’, maps, pay per <b>call,</b> <b>pay</b> per click, and coupons in its website. Increasingly, internet searches are conducted with mobile devices, and a business should customize its information accordingly. ICTs allow business persons to manage virtual teams spread around the globe using the e-mail, messenger, telephones, ‘live meeting’, and ‘share point’. A business woman's office becomes where her computer is (Middleton 2011).|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The American College of Surgeons delineates 108 {{requirements}} for level I trauma centers. Some of these requirements include: minimum of 1, 200 trauma admissions per year; {{an average of}} 35 major trauma patients per surgeon; residency training programs; and 10 peer-reviewed journal submissions every three years. This study examines the variation in services provided among U. S. level I trauma centers. Methods 218 facilities identified as level I trauma centers in 2005 were contacted for participation. 136 centers in 37 states completed the questionnaire. Surveys queried variances in trauma, neurosurgery, plastics, and orthopaedic surgery with regard to type of center, type of accreditation, number and training of participating physicians, number of beds, dedicated OR support (staff/rooms), <b>call</b> <b>pay,</b> and research. Results Of the level I centers surveyed, 66 % are university-affiliated facilities that employ more surgeons and staffing across trauma and all subspecialties compared to community-based or public centers. However, the community and public centers have more surgeons per capita (44 % of the university-affiliated hospitals have six or more trauma surgeons on staff compared to 59 % {{of the community and}} 70 % of the public facilities). University-affiliated centers also provide more in-house subspecialty services (orthopaedic, neurosurgery, and plastics). Thirty-nine percent do not have ACS accreditation and are designated trauma facilities by state or local governments. Only 49 % of trauma centers provide on-call pay to trauma surgeons, and these percentages decline for all subspecialties. Dedicated operating rooms and research programs are also lacking among all subspecialties. Conclusion Based on our findings, we conclude that there are no homogeneous criteria for being accredited as a level I trauma center. Reliable resources should be offered at any facility that claims a level I trauma designation. We do not know if such diversity of services truly impacts care or how it can be measured; nevertheless, it would be logical to presume that at some point services that fall below a minimum threshold would potentially adversely affect the quality of care. In order to develop appropriate policy to decrease possible disparities, differentiation in services between trauma centers must be further researched and described. </p...|$|E
