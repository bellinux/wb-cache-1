5000|$|Horsford {{served as}} {{clinical}} {{assistant at the}} Throat Hospital in Golden Square and was registrar at the <b>Central</b> <b>Throat</b> and Ear Hospital (1905-13). [...] He would later set up private practice on Harley Street. In 1912 he wrote a medical paper entitled ‘Why voices fail’ following which he attracted many singers to his practice on Harley Street. Such was his success that he became laryngologist to the Royal College of Music, the Royal Choral Society and the Royal Society of Musicians. He regularly lectured on the ‘medical aspects of voice production’.|$|E
50|$|The river lapwing is 29-32 cm long. It has a black crest, crown, {{face and}} <b>central</b> <b>throat</b> and grey-white neck sides and nape. It has a grey-brown breast band and white underparts {{with a black}} belly patch. The back is brown, the rump is white and the tail is black. This is a {{striking}} species in flight, with black primaries, white under wings and upper wing secondaries, and brown upper wing coverts.Adults of both sexes are similarly plumaged, but males are slightly larger than females. Young birds have the brown tips to the black head feathers, a sandier brown back, and pale fringes to the upperpart and wing covert feathers. The call of the river lapwing is a sharp tip-tip or did-did-did.|$|E
50|$|The {{yellow-faced myna}} grows to {{a length of}} between 23 and 26 cm {{and is one of}} the largest species of starling. The head has short black {{feathers}} glossed bluish-purple on the forehead and at the base of the upper mandible, but most of the head is bare yellowish-orange skin. This forms a wide patch around and behind the eye and includes a bib on the chin and the sides of the throat. The neck, <b>central</b> <b>throat</b> and mantle are black glossed with purple while the back, wings, breast and belly are black glossed with green. The rump is white, the lower belly is golden-yellow and the undertail-coverts are white. The short, squarish tail is black. The iris is usually yellow, but in some parts of New Guinea may be brown. The bill and legs are yellow.|$|E
5|$|Scales in the <b>central</b> or <b>throat</b> region, {{which are}} {{in contact with the}} first ventral scales of a snake's body and are flanked by the chin shields, are called gular scales. The mental groove is a {{longitudinal}} groove {{on the underside of the}} head between the large, paired chin shields and continuing between the smaller gular scales.|$|R
5000|$|African {{birds have}} a rosy-tinged grey-white <b>central</b> chin and <b>throat,</b> {{with a narrow}} brown breast-band below it, whereas this whole area is solidly tawny-brown on Asian birds.|$|R
50|$|The {{juvenile}} bird is rusty-buff overall, coarsely barred with black; the buff and black banding on its wings is especially pronounced. Its <b>throat,</b> <b>central</b> chest and belly are white. It takes some {{five years to}} acquire adult plumage.|$|R
5000|$|These {{have either}} two throats or two thrust {{chambers}} (with corresponding throats). The <b>central</b> <b>throat</b> is {{of a standard}} design and is surrounded by an annular throat, which exhausts gases from the same (dual-throat) or a separate (dual-expander) thrust chamber. Both throats would, in either case, discharge into a bell nozzle. At higher altitudes, where the ambient pressure is lower, the central nozzle would be shut off, reducing the throat area and thereby increasing the nozzle area ratio. These designs require additional complexity, but an advantage of having two thrust chambers {{is that they can}} be configured to burn different propellants or different fuel mixture ratios. Similarly, Aerojet has also designed a nozzle called the [...] "Thrust Augmented Nozzle", which injects propellant and oxidiser directly into the nozzle section for combustion, allowing larger area ratio nozzles to be used deeper in an atmosphere than they would without augmentation due to effects of flow separation. They would again allow multiple propellants to be used (such as RP-1), further increasing thrust.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Central</b> London <b>Throat</b> Nose and Ear Hospital {{was founded}} in 1874 by Lennox Browne, Llewellyn Thomas, Alfred Hutton, George Wallis and Ernest Turner. The {{hospital}} initially opened in Manchester Street (now Argyle Street), but demand for its services was such that in 1875 it moved to its current location on Gray's Inn Road. In January 1942 the hospital was amalgamated with the Hospital for Diseases of the Throat in Golden Square to form The Royal National Throat Nose and Ear Hospital.|$|R
5|$|The female is {{very similar}} to the male but the upper parts are {{somewhat}} more brownish and the feathers on the crown have narrower black <b>central</b> stripes. The <b>throat</b> and breast are paler with fewer, smaller markings. The beak is similar to the male's winter beak. The juvenile are a duller colour than the adults with pale coloured streaks on the feathers that have dark streaks in the adult. The young assume their adult plumage after their first moult in the autumn.|$|R
40|$|Voice {{and speech}} {{are the result}} of {{coordination}} of many organic systems; upper and lower respiratory tract including the <b>throat,</b> <b>central</b> and peripheral nervous system and articulators. A voice disorder can become an occupational disease, including functional dysphonia which can affect {{the quality of life of}} people who talk a lot at work. Teacher and pedagogical workers belong to a group of occupations with severe vocal loading and they experience overload of speech organs. This can lead to hoarseness and other voice disorders. The prevalence of voice disorders in pedagogical workers in Slovenia was in 2004 estimated to 66...|$|R
50|$|African {{birds have}} a rosy-tinged grey-white <b>central</b> chin and <b>throat,</b> {{with a narrow}} brown breast-band below it, whereas this whole area is solidly tawny-brown on Asian birds; the brown breast and flank {{markings}} on Asian birds are more extensive than on African birds; and African birds have less black on the crown than Asian birds (on males it often tends to be restricted to the forecrown). Male birds also differ compared to the Asian birds in that they lack the extensive pink in their uppertail-coverts, no black spots on their breast-sides; less distinct black markings on the mantle and ear-coverts and almost no red on the face.|$|R
50|$|The sexes are similar. It {{measures}} 16-17 cm {{from bill}} tip to tail tip and weighs 28 g. The adult’s upper parts are grey, with the mantle and secondary feathers tinged brownish olive. The blackish lores and ear coverts {{are separated from}} the crown by a prominent white supercilium. The chin, <b>throat,</b> <b>central</b> breast, rump, upper tail coverts and outer tail feathers are orange. The breast plumage moults to a deeper orange in colour for the non-breeding season. The central tail feathers are greyish-brown, and obscures the bright rufous outer tail feathers when the tail is closed. The belly is pale grey to white, and the undertail coverts buffy. The short, black bill is fairly straight, but with a slightly down-curved upper mandible. The legs and feet are black, and the eye is brown.|$|R
5000|$|With a {{total length}} of 9 - 10 cm and a weight of 2 - 3 g, {{it is among}} the smaller species of hermits. The wing-coverts, mantle, nape and crown are dull {{iridescent}} green, the rump is pale rufous, the belly and flanks are buff, and the <b>central</b> underparts and <b>throat</b> are pale greyish brown, the latter with small dark streaks that often are faint and difficult to see. The face has a blackish [...] "bandit-mask" [...] border above by a whitish-buff supercilium and below by whitish-buff malar. The flight-feathers and tail are blackish; the latter tipped whitish to ochraceous depending on the subspecies involved. As in most other hermits, it has a long, decurved bill. The basal half of the lower mandible is yellow, but otherwise the entire bill is black.|$|R
40|$|Dr Madeleine St Claire YewersColour {{polymorphic}} {{species are}} model systems {{to investigate the}} evolutionary processes that maintain intraspecific diversity within a population. Colour polymorphism occurs when two or more discrete, genetically inherited colour forms coexist within an interbreeding population. Almost ubiquitously, colour morphs differ in morphological, behavioural, ecological, life history and/or physiological traits in addition to colour that often form alternative strategies. Each strategy has optimal trait combinations that allow morphs to maximise fitness. Variation in the trait composition of morph-specific strategies {{has important implications for}} understanding life-history trade-offs and the maintenance of polymorphism within populations. Differences in morph composition and correlated traits between populations can also promote divergence and ultimately speciation. In this thesis, I investigate the evolutionary maintenance of colour polymorphism in the tawny dragon lizard, Ctenophorus decresii. I do so in two distinct ways; by assessing colour vision differences between genetically and geographically distinct monomorphic and polymorphic lineages, and by comparing a range of traits that could differentially affect the fitness of morphs within a colour polymorphic population. In the south of their range, male tawny dragons are monomorphic for throat coloration whereas in the north of their range, they are polymorphic. There are four discrete male colour morphs in polymorphic populations that vary in the presence/absence of yellow and orange coloration; the yellow morph, orange morph, grey morph and orange-yellow morph (a yellow background with a <b>central</b> orange patch). <b>Throat</b> colour is heritable, fixed for life, and is an important sexual signal. Males of the monomorphic southern lineage express ultraviolet (UV) -blue throat coloration, unlike males of the polymorphic northern lineage. Lineages meet at a narrow contact zone where genotypic admixture suggests potential barriers to gene flow and incipient speciation. I determined the cone photoreceptor spectral sensitivities using microspectrophotometry and opsin expression of the two lineages, to see if they differ, particularly in sensitivity to UV-blue wavelengths. I confirmed the presence of four single cone classes in both lineages and provide the first evidence of UV visual sensitivity in agamid lizards. However, whether the lineages differ in UV-blue sensitivity remains unresolved. Within a polymorphic northern population, I assessed a combination of traits associated with each colour morph. I found morph-specific alternative strategies differentiated by consistencies in behaviour and hormones. The orange morph has an aggressive strategy with high levels of androgens while the grey morph has a cautious strategy with low levels of baseline androgens. The yellow morph has a conditional strategy where its aggression depends on the colour of the intruder and exhibits a stress-induced androgen increase. The orange-yellow morph similarly shows aggression conditional on the colour of the intruder but it is the boldest with high levels of androgens. Morphs did not differ in performance (bite force) or space use, and there was no relationship between spatial arrangement and relatedness. However, genetic structure based on microsatellite markers indicated weak genetic differentiation between morphs. Therefore, there are minimal barriers to gene flow between morphs. Instead, frequency-dependent selection is likely to be maintaining polymorphism in the tawny dragon lizard. Open Acces...|$|R
