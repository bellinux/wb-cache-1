5|$|In 1992, Congress passed must-carry regulations, which {{required}} cable carriers to allocate spectrum to local broadcasters. This affected {{the availability of}} C-SPAN in some areas, in particular C-SPAN2, as some providers chose to discontinue carriage of the channel altogether. Between 1993 and 1994, cable systems in 95 U.S. cities dropped or reduced broadcasts of C-SPAN and C-SPAN2, following {{the implementation of the}} must-carry regulations. Viewers protested these decisions, especially when the changes coincided with matters of local interest occurring in the House or Senate. Some communities, such as Eugene, Oregon and Alexandria, Virginia, were successful in restoring C-SPAN availability. C-SPAN availability was later restored as technological developments that resulted in the expansion of <b>channel</b> <b>capacity</b> on cable providers allowed for mandatory stations and the C-SPAN networks both to be broadcast.|$|E

30|$|The RBS first {{estimates}} <b>channel</b> <b>capacities</b> {{and receives}} {{information about the}} rates and distortions for the frames in one GOP from every user. It then finds an approximate solution to the GOP level CADF problem by iteratively running the PTAS and solving the restricted MKP multiple times. Since the effective <b>channel</b> <b>capacities</b> are mutually coupled with {{each other through the}} SINR constraints, and are not known prior to actually scheduling the frames, we bootstrap the algorithm by using a small initial guess of the transmit power for all users. This gives fixed <b>channel</b> <b>capacities,</b> which we use to run the PTAS for the first time. For every subsequent iteration, we increase the transmit power for one of the users that has the lowest capacity so far. We continue this iterative process of solving the PTAS until convergence, i.e., until none of the users can increase their transmit power without violating the SINR constraints. In our experiments, we ran the PTAS 25 iterations on average.|$|R

25|$|The {{amount of}} data that can be {{transmitted}} (and therefore the number of channels) is directly affected by <b>channel</b> <b>capacity</b> and the modulation method of the channel. The modulation method in DVB-T is COFDM with either 64 or 16-state Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM). In general, a 64QAM channel is capable of transmitting a greater bit rate, but is more susceptible to interference. 16 and 64QAM constellations can be combined in a single multiplex, providing a controllable degradation for more important program streams. This is called hierarchical modulation.|$|E

25|$|Polarization is {{important}} in radio communications because, for instance, if one attempts to use a horizontally polarized antenna to receive a vertically polarized transmission, the signal strength will be substantially reduced (or under very controlled conditions, reduced to nothing). This principle is used in satellite television in order to double the <b>channel</b> <b>capacity</b> over a fixed frequency band. The same frequency channel {{can be used for}} two signals broadcast in opposite polarizations. By adjusting the receiving antenna for one or the other polarization, either signal can be selected without interference from the other.|$|E
25|$|Coding {{theory is}} {{concerned}} with finding explicit methods, called codes, for increasing the efficiency and reducing the error rate of data communication over noisy channels to near the <b>channel</b> <b>capacity.</b> These codes can be roughly subdivided into data compression (source coding) and error-correction (channel coding) techniques. In the latter case, it took many years to find the methods Shannon's work proved were possible. A third class of information theory codes are cryptographic algorithms (both codes and ciphers). Concepts, methods and results from coding theory and information theory are widely used in cryptography and cryptanalysis. See the article ban (unit) for a historical application.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{information}} {{collected by the}} MIDAS satellites was extraordinarily time-sensitive, the designers of the system could not use the film-canister dropping system that had been pioneered by the Discoverer/Corona/Samos series of reconnaissance satellites. In that system, the cameras aboard the satellites used photographic film capsules that physically re-entered the atmosphere before being retrieved mid-air by a military airplane. The MIDAS satellites would instead have to transmit their warning signals earthward via radio waves. Actual infrared images would not be transmitted due to the limited RF <b>channel</b> <b>capacity</b> that was available then. Instead, the satellite would simply send radio messages that it had detected a suspected missile launch {{as well as the}} time and location of the launch.|$|E

25|$|Papers by Gerard J. Foschini and Michael J. Gans, Foschini and Emre Telatar {{have shown}} that the <b>channel</b> <b>capacity</b> (a {{theoretical}} upper bound on system throughput) for a MIMO system is increased as the number of antennas is increased, proportional to the smaller of the number of transmit antennas and the number of receive antennas. This is known as the multiplexing gain and this basic finding in information theory is what led to a spurt of research in this area. Despite the simple propagation models used in the aforementioned seminal works, the multiplexing gain is a fundamental property that can be proved under almost any physical channel propagation model and with practical hardware that is prone to transceiver impairments.|$|E
25|$|On August 1, 1980, HBO {{launched}} Cinemax, {{a companion}} movie-based premium channel created as HBO's answer to fellow movie-oriented pay service The Movie Channel (which operated as a standalone {{service at the}} time). Unlike HBO, Cinemax maintained a 24-hour schedule from its launch. The channel succeeded early on partly due to its reliance on movie classics from the 1950s to the 1970s – with some more recent films mixed in – that would be presented uncut and without commercial interruption, {{at a time when}} cable subscribers only received about three dozen channels due to limited headend <b>channel</b> <b>capacity.</b> In most cases, cable operators sold Cinemax and HBO as a single package, usually offered at a discount for customers that chose to subscribe to both channels.|$|E
25|$|Spatial {{multiplexing}} requires MIMO antenna configuration. In spatial multiplexing, a high-rate {{signal is}} split into multiple lower-rate streams and each stream {{is transmitted from}} a different transmit antenna in the same frequency channel. If these signals arrive at the receiver antenna array with sufficiently different spatial signatures and the receiver has accurate CSI, it can separate these streams into (almost) parallel channels. Spatial multiplexing {{is a very powerful}} technique for increasing <b>channel</b> <b>capacity</b> at higher signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). The maximum number of spatial streams is limited by the lesser of the number of antennas at the transmitter or receiver. Spatial multiplexing can be used without CSI at the transmitter, but can be combined with precoding if CSI is available. Spatial multiplexing can also be used for simultaneous transmission to multiple receivers, known as space-division multiple access or multi-user MIMO, in which case CSI is required at the transmitter. The scheduling of receivers with different spatial signatures allows good separability.|$|E
30|$|An {{important}} difference with MKP: We point out an {{important difference}} between the GOP level CADF problem and the restricted MKP in terms of knapsack (i.e., <b>channel)</b> <b>capacities.</b> The capacity constraints in the CADF problem are coupled with each other by the SINR constraints. This means allocating a certain transmit power to one user not only consumes its own capacity, but also reduces the capacity of other users due to interference. Thus, it is not until we actually start scheduling the frames and assigning transmit powers that we come to know of the residual <b>channel</b> <b>capacities.</b> Therefore, the achievable rate for a given user is not known prior to actually scheduling the frames, which corresponds to packing the items. This {{is in contrast to}} the restricted MKP, where the knapsack capacities are fixed and known a priori. In our approach, we overcome this interdependency of <b>channel</b> <b>capacities</b> by iteratively solving the PTAS for the restricted MKP. In the following section, we describe an adaptive solution to the CADF problem using this iterative PTAS, and combine the solution with two heuristics for incorporating channel variations that might have occurred during multiple runs of the PTAS.|$|R
