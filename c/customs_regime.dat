The Allies have reserved the right to apply a special <b>customs</b> <b>régime</b> to the occupied area {{on the bank of}} the Rhine, [...] "in the event of such a measure being necessary in their opinion in order to safeguard the economic interests of the population of these territories."[60] This provision was probably introduced as a possibly useful adjunct to the French policy of somehow detaching the left bank provinces from Germany during the years of their occupation. The project of establishing an independent Republic under French clerical auspices, which would act as a buffer state and realize the French ambition of driving Germany proper beyond the Rhine, has not yet been abandoned. Some believe that much may be accomplished by a régime of threats, bribes, and cajolery extended over a period of fifteen years or longer.[61] If this Article is acted upon, and the economic system of the left bank of the Rhine is effectively severed from the rest of Germany, the effect would be far-reaching. But the dreams of designing diplomats do not always prosper, and we must trust the future.|$|E

40|$|The {{world of}} {{international}} trade has evolved over the centuries and, with this process of evolution, unique challenges have emerged over time. International trade, in essence, involves the movement {{of goods and services}} across borders; it is conducted mainly by private firms rather than governments. The suggested role of government is to create an environment that allows for efficient international trade. Such an environment is manifested in the provision of an adequate physical infrastructure and a transparent regulatory environment. Today, an organisation such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), whose members direct the vast bulk {{of international trade}}, plays an active role in advancing the agenda of a rules-based international trade regime. This same organization also provides, on an ongoing basis, initiatives directed to improving the facilitation of trade internationally. Examples of trade facilitation initiatives are the recent Bali-Agreement (The Trade Facilitation Agreement, 2013), signed by WTO members in 2013 in Bali, and the Revised Kyoto Convention of the World Customs Organization (WCO) which has, as its objective, the elimination of barriers to efficient international trade. This dissertation focuses on <b>customs</b> penalty <b>regime</b> as utilised by South Africa. The South African regime is compared with certain foreign and international <b>customs</b> penalty <b>regimes</b> (in this case, Canada, the United States of America and the European Union).

50|$|In 1355 Peter IV {{called a}} {{parliament}} of the Sard nobility {{in order to}} address the resistance to his rule of Judge Marianus IV of Arborea, but the greater nobles refused to attend. This was nevertheless the first Sardinian parliament. One of its acts was to exclude all those of non-noble birth from entering the nobility (heretats). Its role was formalised in the constitution promulgated by Alfonso V in 1421, after which it was convened (semi-)regularly every ten years. Many members of the Sardinian parliament visited the Corts of Catalonia and were familiar with its functioning. The Corts in turn seems to have regarded Sardinia as lying within its jurisdiction, for in 1366 it petition Peter IV to revoke the law of exclusion passed in 1355. The king refused {{on the grounds that it}} was not right for laws passed by the parliament of one kingdom to be revoked by the parliament of another. This was relevant to Peter's other dispute with the Catalans, who wished to be exempted from the Sardinian <b>customs</b> <b>regime.</b> So long as Catalans were residents of the island they were subject to its parliament's laws. In 1421, in imitation of the Corts, the Stamenti demanded the redress of grievances before voting on taxes. Establishing the priority of the former greatly augmented a parliament's power. When the taxes were approved, the Stamenti established a committee of three, one from each estate, to oversee their collection.|$|E

40|$|The Socialist Republic of Vietnam {{committed}} to bring its laws, regulations and administrative procedures into conformity with the WTO rules-based trading agreements and to honour its obligations {{with respect to}} development {{of the rule of}} law. This study examines the areas of friction that Vietnam is likely to encounter as it implements the WTO legal regime. It hypothesised that a smooth transfer and adaptation of the Western-based <b>customs</b> <b>regime</b> requires Vietnamese recipients to understand and support principles of transparency and liberalisation of the WTO that differ from socialist principles underlying the Vietnameselegal system. Having adopted a social construction view, this study of national interpretation assumed that state actors of Vietnam were not passive receivers of the WTO customs rules but rather constructed the meaning given to the global rules. Discourse analysis was proved as the suitable methodology since Party and State’s understandings about the WTO <b>customs</b> <b>regime</b> were largely generated through communicative processes. The three streams of discourse modes, interpretive communities and discursive strategies were tested to assess the WTO-related regulatory conversations within and amongst groups of domestic implementers at different state levels: the Party and State’s high policy making, customs lawmaking central level, and the law implementation local level. The principal conclusion reached was that the transfer of WTO principal rules in Vietnam is difficult because political leaders, lawmakers and government officials at different state levels did not fully understand and interpret the WTO basic objectives. The domestic reforms toward the Western rule of law revealed the biggest complication of the prevailing socialist constraints of party leadership and power concentration. These political contradictions prevent the Party and State leaders to interpret the WTO principles of economic law and the liberalisation objectives that presented a slow shift from the Soviet-originated thinking of state economic management to the Western thinking of free market access. Another conclusion was that the Party and State’s interpretations of the WTO objectives shaped the Customs’ cognitive assumptions and allowed customs lawmakers and regulators to reinterpret and reformulate the WTO customs rules. The repetitive customs law making discourse did not result in a smooth transfer of the WTO-WCO customs rules because of the incompatible high political level thinking and the Customs’ reinterpretations and reformulation. The results also revealed that power structures and cognitive assumptions in Customs shaped the implementation of the imported customs regimes, especially when the WTO valuations rules were reinterpreted by customs regulators for the daily application. Though customs administrators and judges wanted to promote an effective and efficient customs administration to approach the WTO objectives, there still existed discrepancies in the administrative and judiciary interpretations of the WTO legality requirement...|$|E

40|$|The Diploma {{thesis is}} focused on Community customs union and {{relations}} with third countries, regarding particularly customs procedure during foreign transit operations. It is aimed to summarize basic knowledge regarding TIR system operation with emphasis on its current development and modernization. At present, TIR regime is experiencing a very dynamic progress, and it is related both to its computerization {{and changes in the}} European Union, which tends to enhance safety standards on the international level when shipping the goods. Therefore, the means of communication are improved by the interconnection of main actors engaged in business transactions, such as national customs authorities and associations, traders and international organisations. The first part of the thesis deals with customs union and common trade policy of European Union. It defines the term of customs union and European customs union territory, specifies both internal and external aspects of customs union existence, and shortly describes the process of European customs union creation. The two following chapters are concerned with the customs administration, legislation and basic documentation forming customs legislation of European Union. The fourth chapter describes the development and customs union improvement with its new strategy and modernized customs union codex. The second part concentrates on the analysis of customs procedure in general and international <b>customs</b> <b>regimes.</b> It describes the basic terms used in customs administration, specifies the ways of customs debt calculation and factors which may lead to the customs debt. The closing chapter is devoted to transit regimes functioning not only on the territory of the European Union, but in third countries as well. The third part addresses the TIR transit regime. At the beginning, the foundation and historical development of the regime is described, followed by its mission, principles and territorial scope. In the next chapter the basic conditions of membership are identified. The following chapter is reserved for description and explanation of international guarantee system, mutual relations of its participants and forms of guarantee provision. In the last chapter the carnet TIR - main document used for customs purposes when shipping - is highlighted. The last chapter {{is focused on}} TIR system computerization, its innovation and improvement, and development mainly in recent years.

30|$|Today, few free ports {{remain at}} the level of a city state, but there are notable {{exceptions}} such as Singapore, Hong Kong, Malta and Dubai. Still, they belong to larger economic entities having a common <b>customs</b> regulatory <b>regime.</b> Nowadays, there are free ports connecting to a network of free zones. These free ports are incorporating different types of free zones such as industry and services into a ‘free zone area’. Mauritius, for instance, linked the free zones of its port and airport to industrial zones producing textile and then developed an IT dedicated free zone (Lavissière, 2014). All these zones are linked commercially but also physically within customs corridors (where flows are permitted on the domestic system as long as they go from one element of the free zone to another). Tanger-Med has a similar development strategy with its port, a planned airport, an automotive free zone, a logistics free port, an industrial free zone and an offshore banking free zone. This model illustrates a regionalization of free ports by permitting a specialization of the free port functions within the free port itself as well as through satellite facilities. Thus, the regulatory framework of free ports corresponds to infrastructural developments of transport terminals in regard to their hinterland. Tanger-Med and Barcelona Free Zone also signed an agreement on promotion, exchange of best practices and trade facilitation that creates a customs free corridor between the two entities. In the United States, free zones are technically networked since it is possible to move goods from one zone to another without disbursing custom duties. Still, this status is in its infancy at the transnational level and {{it remains to be seen}} the scale and extent free ports will create effective trade networks.|$|R
