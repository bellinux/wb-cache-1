5|$|In Lindsay Lohan's Indian Journey, Lohan meets and {{interviews}} victims of human trafficking in Delhi, Kolkata and {{a village in}} West Bengal. They talk about the exploitation and abuse they have experienced, describing sexual slavery, physical abuse and difficulties in bringing their traffickers to justice. She also talks to a former trafficker and parents of trafficked children. One trafficked boy says that he <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> back home because his mother is ill. A mother who trafficked her daughter describes how her family {{did not have enough}} food, and how even though they never received the promised payments for her daughter's work, at least she was fed.|$|E
5|$|She {{falls in}} love with Des, Daphne's widower and they became engaged. This {{engagement}} comes to an end when Nell suffers a heart attack and she goes to England to nurse her back to health. Des waits for his bride-to-be, but a few months later, Jane phones and tells Des that she <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> through with the wedding and settles down in England with her grandmother. Jane appears in Annalise Hartman's (Kimberley Davies) documentary focusing on past residents of Ramsay Street, she reveals that she is still living with Nell.|$|E

25|$|The theory {{contains}} only one half {{the explanation of}} man's origins and needs spiritualism to carry it through and complete it. For while this ascent on the physical side has been progressing through myriads of ages, the Divine descent has also been going on – man being spiritually an incarnation from the Divine {{as well as a}} human development from the animal creation. The cause of the development is spiritual. Mr. Darwin's theory does not in the least militate against ours – we think it necessitates it; he simply does not deal with our side of the subject. He <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> lower than the dust of the earth for the matter of life; and for us, the main interest of our origin must lie in the spiritual domain.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{previous}} days, especially the Friday of Sorrows and the Saturday of Passion, some brotherhoods already do processions. [...] These brotherhoods are usually historical confraternities of neighborhoods {{very far from}} the center, as the Brotherhood of the Sorrows from Puerto de la Torre or Brotherhood of the Sorrows from Churriana, or young brotherhoods that still {{do not belong to}} the Brotherhood' Association, so even they <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> through the official route.|$|E

50|$|Allman {{appeared}} in the rock comedy series called Who the Hell is Dan Bruder which launched online June 2010. It {{is the story of}} a slightly delusional, middle-aged wannabe rocker who <b>can</b> <b>not</b> let <b>go</b> of the dream of stardom.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was safe}} once, no doubt," [...] {{answered}} Geoffrey, slightly puzzled {{as to how}} he had offended her, but still resolute. [...] "The rains of last winter, however, have washed out much of the surface soil, leaving bare parts of the rock beneath, and the next angle yonder is positively dangerous. <b>Can</b> we <b>not</b> <b>go</b> around?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Horribly," [...] she confessed. [...] "I do {{not know}} why, but London is getting on my nerves. It is so hatefully, stubbornly, obstinately imperturbable. I would find another word, but it eludes me. I think you would call it smug. And it is so noisy. <b>Can</b> we <b>not</b> <b>go</b> somewhere for lunch where it is tranquil, where one can rest and {{get away from this}} roar?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are {{you sure}} about Olive?" [...] asked Mr. Easterfield. [...] "She has never said {{positively}} {{that she is}} going. I most earnestly hope that she will not back out because Lancaster <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>go.</b> If she stays her uncle will stay." ...|$|E

6000|$|His {{companion}} nodded gravely. [...] "It is a {{hard thing}} I have to say, but you are right in this," [...] he said. [...] "I have a flock, {{and some of them}} would perish if I left them. For their sake I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>go.</b> It is not for me to take my part in a splendid folly, but"--and he spread his thin hands out--"because it is so I am sorry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why <b>can</b> I <b>not</b> <b>go</b> too? on {{the same}} boat, just to be near him in case he needs me. I should not {{let him know that}} I was on board, not make even a sign,--unless--he missed me. Oh! let me go with him. It is not fair that another woman should have my place--my {{absolute}} right to be near him. He is my husband! I cannot bear it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, {{there is}} more to be done," [...] cried the prince, carried away by the ambitious dream. [...] "There is still the city of Constantine to be taken, and war to be waged against the Soldan of Damascus. And beyond him again there is tribute to be levied from the Cham of Tartary and from the kingdom of Cathay. Ha! John, what say you? <b>Can</b> we <b>not</b> <b>go</b> as far eastward as Richard of the Lion Heart?" ...|$|R
6000|$|And I do {{come home}} at Christmas. We all do, or we all should. We all come home, or ought to come home, for a short holiday--the longer, the better--from the great boarding-school, where we are for ever working at our arithmetical slates, to take, and give a rest. As to going a visiting, where <b>can</b> we <b>not</b> <b>go,</b> if we will; where have we not been, when we would; {{starting}} our fancy from our Christmas Tree! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I knew it, {{but you had}} company then," [...] said Poindexter, with ironical gallantry, [...] "and I wouldn't disturb you." [...] Without {{saying how}} he knew it, he continued, [...] "In the stage-coach you might be recognized. You must go in a private {{conveyance}} and alone; even I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> with you, for I must go on before and meet you there. Can you drive forty miles?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But you <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> {{back in that}} plight," [...] he said; [...] "let me dust your skirt." [...] And {{breaking}} a little branch from a bush, he proceeded to make her look presentable. [...] "And now," [...] said he, when she had complimented him upon his skill, [...] "I will walk with you {{to the entrance of}} the grounds. Perhaps as you are so tired," [...] he said hesitatingly, [...] "I can help you along, so that you will not have to work so hard yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What of it?" [...] cried Tom, and {{his whole}} form trembled as he spoke. [...] "You have here {{a source of}} wealth, of opulence which shall endure {{for the rest of}} your days.

No, sir, I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> in to supper. I can not eat. I leave to you the business and practical part of this affair. I go to report upon its scientific features." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the Conference was to start a debate about studies and {{research}} relating to the circulation of the different forms of knowledge in the Mediterranean Basin, {{in order to build}} tools for planning, managing and evaluating territorial actions able to produce a positive impact on the Europeanization and on the perception of Europe by the citizens.

50|$|The {{object of}} the game is for the Bakunawa to tag or touch the buwan/bulan.

6000|$|... "Mary, {{your father}} and I are going out to ride this afternoon, and I am going to explain it all to you why you <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> too. You see, I have been sick, and am getting well, and I am going out to ride, so that I may get well faster. You love mamma, I am sure, and wish to have her get well soon. So {{you will be a}} good girl, I know, and not make any trouble, but will stay at home contentedly--won't you? Then I shall love you, and your papa will love you, and after I get well we will take you to ride with us some day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You and I, and Bella," [...] {{answered}} Mary Erskine. [...] "I {{will tell}} you what my plan is. I expect that I shall conclude to stay here, and live in this house alone for some years to come, and the children <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> to school, for there is now nobody to take them, and it is too far for them to go alone. I must teach them myself at home, or else they can not learn. I am very sorry indeed now that I did not learn to read and write when I was a child: for that would have saved me the time and trouble of learning now. But I think I can learn now. Don't you think I can, Mary?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I have not," [...] said Lawrence. [...] "If {{the matter}} had been decided, {{one way or}} the other, I should not be here. I have no right to {{trespass}} on your aunt's hospitality, and I should have departed as soon as I had discovered Miss March's sentiments in regard to me. But I {{have not been able to}} settle the matter, at all. I had one opportunity of seeing the lady, and that was not a satisfactory interview. Yesterday morning, I made another attempt, but before I could get to her I sprained my ankle. And here I am; I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> to her, and, of course, she will not come to me. You cannot imagine how I chafe under this harassing restraint." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper uses {{a natural}} {{extension}} of Lee and Wilde's (1980) model {{to show that}} the outcome of technological competition between firms (or countries) depends on the resolution of two forces: the profit incentive and the competitive threat. Using a duopoly model of a patent race, the paper illustrates that, by understanding the relative strength of these two forces, one <b>can</b> <b>not</b> only <b>go</b> a long way to understanding the outcome of these races, but also obtain crucial insights into the desirability of various R&D policies. The particular example considered in the paper is the subsidizing of R&D effort. Copyright 1989 by Royal Economic Society. ...|$|R

60|$|But {{this last}} {{supposition}} {{is almost always}} unnecessary; for if Mary has been habitually managed on this principle she will not make any trouble. She will perceive at once that the question is settled--settled irrevocably--and especially that it is entirely beyond the power of any demonstrations of insubmission or rebellion that she can make to change it. She will acquiesce at once.[A] She may be sorry that she <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>go,</b> but she will make no resistance. Those children only attempt to carry their points by noisy and violent demonstrations who find, by experience, that such measures are usually successful. A child, even, who has become once accustomed to them, will soon drop them if she finds, owing {{to a change in}} the system of management, that they now never succeed. And a child who never, from the beginning, finds any efficiency in them, never learns to employ them at all.|$|E
6000|$|... {{when many}} men still lived {{who had seen}} the Christ; here Mary Magdalen died, and here the Virgin Mary ended her days with John, albeit Rome has since judged it best to locate her grave elsewhere; six or seven hundred years ago--almost yesterday, as it were--troops of mail-clad Crusaders thronged the streets; and {{to come down to}} trifles, we speak of {{meandering}} streams, and find a new interest in a common word when we discover that the crooked river Meander, in yonder valley, gave it to our dictionary. It makes me feel as old as these dreary hills to look down upon these moss-hung ruins, this historic desolation. One may read the Scriptures and believe, but he <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> and stand yonder in the ruined theatre and in imagination people it again with the vanished multitudes who mobbed Paul's comrades there and shouted, with one voice, [...] "Great is Diana of the Ephesians!" [...] The idea of a shout in such a solitude as this almost makes one shudder.|$|E
60|$|To {{feel any}} commiseration for this young lady, {{on account of}} the alarm which she may be {{supposed}} to have experienced at seeing all those strange men in her chamber, would be sympathy thrown away, for her nerves were not of a sensibility to be affected much by such a circumstance as that. In fact, as the difficulties between the young king's government and the Parisians increased, Anne Maria played quite the part of a heroine. She went back and forth to Paris in her carriage, through the mob, when nobody else dared to go. She sometimes headed troops, and escorted ladies and gentlemen when they were afraid to go alone. Once she relieved a town, and once she took the command of the cannon of the Bastille, and issued her orders to fire with it upon the troops, with a composure which would have done honor to any veteran officer of artillery. We <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> into all these things here in detail, as they would lead us too far away from the subject of this narrative. We only allude to them, to give our readers some distinct idea of the temperament and character of the rich and blooming beauty whom young King Charles was wishing so ardently to make his bride.|$|E
