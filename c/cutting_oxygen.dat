The same procedure involving virgin steel in steel trade and mass production of steel objects gave no such evidence, even though no final conclusions can be drawn because of the low number of samples analyzed. Low dioxin exposures during inert gas electric arc welding confirm previous literature findings, whereas soldering and thermal <b>oxygen</b> <b>cutting</b> in the presence of polyvinyl chloride give rise to concern. The consequences of occupational dioxin exposure were studied by analysis of the dioxin-blood concentration, the body burden, of men performing thermal <b>oxygen</b> <b>cutting</b> at scrap metal reclamation and demolition sites, in steel trade and producing plants as well as for industrial welders and white-collar workers. The results concerning body burdens are in excellent agreement with the dioxin exposure as characterized by dioxin air concentration in the workplace. The significant positive correlation between duration and frequency of performing thermal <b>oxygen</b> <b>cutting</b> at metal reclamation and demolition sites expressed in job-years and dioxin body burden speaks for the occupational origin of the observed overload after long times.

40|$|The {{contribution}} {{deals with}} comparing non-traditional cutting technologies {{from the point}} of view of generated surface roughness. The comparison is carried out for technologies of abrasive waterjet <b>cutting,</b> <b>oxygen</b> cutting, laser and plasma cutting. As an experimental material, EN S 355 J 0 structural steel and titanium CP-Ti Grade 2 was used. Surface topography measurement was done using a Mitutoyo Surftest SJ- 401 instrument, and an optical profilometer MicroProf FRT was used for comparison and verification of acquired surface data. The aim of the contribution is to clarify, on the basis of experimental measurements, the behaviour of a topographic function after various ways of cutting; the knowledge of the function is necessary for solving both theoretical and practical technological tasks. The topographic function, which is a basis for the prediction of quality and control of the cutting processes, was derived in an original way. The use of individual technologies depends on technical and economical possibilities and on environmental influences. The results of measurement of cut surface roughness are in good accordance with the results of theoretical analysis. Web of Science 691 - 4918...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{gives an}} {{analysis}} of acoustic-emission signals measured {{in the course of}} laser cutting of steels plates DC 04 and X 5 CrNi 18 - 10. Laser cutting is a process in which there can be a wide range of cutting parameters, but nevertheless cutting of plate products can be accomplished. Within the range of the parameters concerned, however, the quality of a cut edge can vary quite strongly; laser-beam power density, cutting speed and consumption of <b>cutting</b> <b>oxygen</b> are closely related to the cost-effectiveness of the cutting process. The research was focused on laser cutting of steel plate DC 04 and of austenitic stainless steel plate X 5 CrNi 18 - 10 of 1. 5 mm in thickness, which is frequently used in the production of body components in automotive industry. AE signals captured and measured with a PZT contact sensor during laser cutting can provide useful information for the assessment of laser-cut quality. Similarly AE bursts sensed after laser cutting give a good insight into the laser-cut quality. A use of AE measurement during laser cutting of a deep-drawn mudguard is described as well. 1...|$|E

40|$|Thermal cutting methods, are {{commonly}} used {{in the manufacture of}} metal parts. Thermal cutting processes separate materials by using heat. The process can be done with or without a stream of <b>cutting</b> <b>oxygen.</b> Common processes are Oxygen, plasma and laser cutting. It depends on the application and material which cutting method is used. Numerically-controlled thermal cutting is a cost-effective way of prefabricating components. One design aim is to minimize the number of work steps in order to increase competitiveness. This has resulted in the holes and openings in plate parts manufactured today being made using thermal cutting methods. This is a problem from the fatigue life perspective because there is local detail in the as-welded state that causes a rise in stress in a local area of the plate. In a case where the static utilization of a net section is full used, the calculated linear local stresses and stress ranges are often over 2 times the material yield strength. The shakedown criteria are exceeded. Fatigue life assessment of flame-cut details is commonly based on the nominal stress method. For welded details, design standards and instructions provide more accurate and flexible methods, e. g. a hot-spot method, but these methods are not universally applied to flame cut edges. Some of the fatigue tests of flame cut edges in the laboratory indicated that fatigue life estimations based on the standard nominal stress method can give quite a conservative fatigue life estimate in cases where a high notch factor was present. This is an undesirable phenomenon and it limits the potential for minimizing structure size and total costs. A new calculation method is introduced to improve the accuracy of the theoretical fatigue life prediction method of a flame cut edge with a high stress concentration factor. Simple equations were derived by using laboratory fatigue test results, which are published in this work. The proposed method is called the modified FAT method (FATmod). The method takes into account the residual stress state, surface quality, material strength class and true stress ratio in the critical place...|$|E
