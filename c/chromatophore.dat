Bacteriochlorophyll-rich and succinic dehydrogenase-rich <b>chromatophores</b> that were essentially devoid of contamination by non-chromatophore protein were separated from a denser fraction in extracts disrupted in a French pressure cell. Highly purified <b>chromatophores</b> and a nearly photopigment-free envelope fraction were also obtained from cells lysed by treatment with ethylenediaminetetraacetate-lysozyme-Brij 58. After lysis with lysozyme and ethylenediaminetetraacetate alone, about 50 % of the total photosynthetic pigment was released in <b>chromatophores</b> similar to those isolated by the above procedures. <b>Chromatophores</b> prepared by each method {{were found to have}} very similar near-infrared absorption spectra, overall chemical composition, equilibrium buoyant densities in CsCl, and protein patterns in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

5|$|Leucism {{differs from}} {{albinism}} {{in that the}} melanin is, at least, partially absent but the eyes retain their usual color. Some leucistic animals are white or pale because of <b>chromatophore</b> (pigment cell) defects, and do not lack melanin.|$|E
5|$|Each <b>chromatophore</b> {{contains}} pigment of {{only one}} colour. In fish and frogs, colour change is mediated {{by the type of}} chromatophores known as melanophores that contain dark pigment. A melanophore is star-shaped; it contains many small pigmented organelles which can be dispersed throughout the cell, or aggregated near its centre. When the pigmented organelles are dispersed, the cell makes a patch of the animal's skin appear dark; when they are aggregated, most of the cell, and the animal's skin, appears light. In frogs, the change is controlled relatively slowly, mainly by hormones. In fish, the change is controlled by the brain, which sends signals directly to the chromatophores, as well as producing hormones.|$|E
5|$|Some animals {{including}} cephalopods like squid {{are able}} to vary their colours rapidly for both camouflage and signalling. The mechanisms include reversible proteins which can be switched between two configurations. The configuration of reflectin proteins in <b>chromatophore</b> cells in {{the skin of the}} Doryteuthis pealeii squid is controlled by electric charge. When charge is absent, the proteins stack together tightly, forming a thin, more reflective layer; when charge is present, the molecules stack more loosely, forming a thicker layer. Since chromatophores contain multiple reflectin layers, the switch changes the layer spacing and hence the colour of light that is reflected.|$|E
40|$|AbstractLipid-impregnated {{collodion}} (nitrocellulose) {{films have}} been frequently {{used as a}} fusion substrate in the measurement and analysis of electrogenic activity in biological membranes and proteoliposomes. While the method of fusion of biological membranes or proteoliposomes with such films has found a wide application, {{little is known about}} the structures formed after the fusion. Yet, knowledge of this structure is important for the interpretation of the measured electric potential. To characterize structures formed after fusion of membrane vesicles (<b>chromatophores)</b> from the purple bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides with lipid-impregnated collodion films, we used near-field scanning optical microscopy. It is shown here that structures formed from <b>chromatophores</b> on the collodion film can be distinguished from the lipid-impregnated background by measuring the fluorescence originating either from endogenous fluorophores of the <b>chromatophores</b> or from fluorescent dyes trapped inside the <b>chromatophores.</b> The structures formed after fusion of <b>chromatophores</b> to the collodion film look like isolated (or sometimes aggregated, depending on the conditions) blisters, with diameters ranging from 0. 3 to 10 μm (average ≈ 1 μm) and heights from 0. 01 to 1 μm (average ≈ 0. 03 μm). These large sizes indicate that the blisters are formed by the fusion of many <b>chromatophores.</b> Results with dyes trapped inside <b>chromatophores</b> reveal that <b>chromatophores</b> fused with lipid-impregnated films retain a distinct internal water phase...|$|R

5|$|When {{cephalopod}} molluscs like squid and cuttlefish {{find themselves}} against a light background, they contract {{many of their}} chromatophores, concentrating the pigment into a smaller area, resulting in a pattern of tiny, dense, but widely spaced dots, appearing light. When they enter a darker environment, they allow their chromatophores to expand, creating a pattern of larger dark spots, and making their bodies appear dark. Amphibians such as frogs have three kinds of star-shaped <b>chromatophore</b> cells in separate layers of their skin. The top layer contains 'xanthophores' with orange, red, or yellow pigments; the middle layer contains 'iridophores' with a silvery light-reflecting pigment; while the bottom layer contains 'melanophores' with dark melanin.|$|E

25|$|Coleoid {{cephalopods}} (including octopuses, squids and cuttlefish) have complex multicellular organs {{that they}} use to change colour rapidly, producing {{a wide variety of}} bright colours and patterns. Each <b>chromatophore</b> unit is composed of a single <b>chromatophore</b> cell and numerous muscle, nerve, glial, and sheath cells. Inside the <b>chromatophore</b> cell, pigment granules are enclosed in an elastic sac, called the cytoelastic sacculus. To change colour the animal distorts the sacculus form or size by muscular contraction, changing its translucency, reflectivity, or opacity. This differs from the mechanism used in fish, amphibians, and reptiles in that the shape of the sacculus is changed, rather than translocating pigment vesicles within the cell. However, a similar effect is achieved.|$|E

40|$|In amphibians, colour, patterns, {{and their}} changes are {{determined}} by pigmented <b>chromatophores</b> (melanophores and xanthophores) and reflective iridophores. The synthesis or destruction of pigments due to a persistent or continuous lack of stimulation of the <b>chromatophores</b> result in a slow and long-lasting (days to months) morphological colour change (Dullman & Trueb 1994). On the other hand, a rapid, hormone-stimulated rearrangement of pigment organelles within the <b>chromatophores</b> results in a physiological colour change (reviewed by Thibaudeau & Altig 2012). Physiological colour change can be a direct response of <b>chromatophores</b> to light (primary response), or a secondary response, mediated by the eyes and controlled by the neural and/or endocrine systems (Oshima 2001, Sköld et al. 2013) ...|$|R

25|$|While most chloroplasts {{originate}} from that {{first set of}} endosymbiotic events, Paulinella chromatophora is an exception that acquired a photosynthetic cyanobacterial endosymbiont more recently. It {{is not clear whether}} that symbiont is closely related to the ancestral chloroplast of other eukaryotes. Being {{in the early stages of}} endosymbiosis, Paulinella chromatophora can offer some insights into how chloroplasts evolved. Paulinella cells contain one or two sausage shaped blue-green photosynthesizing structures called chromatophores, descended from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus. Chromatophores cannot survive outside their host. <b>Chromatophore</b> DNA is about a million base pairs long, containing around 850 protein encoding genes—far less than the three million base pair Synechococcus genome, but much larger than the approximately 150,000 base pair genome of the more assimilated chloroplast. Chromatophores have transferred much less of their DNA to the nucleus of their host. About 0.3–0.8% of the nuclear DNA in Paulinella is from the <b>chromatophore,</b> compared with 11–14% from the chloroplast in plants.|$|E
25|$|Humans {{have only}} one class of pigment cell, the {{mammalian}} equivalent of melanophores, to generate skin, hair, and eye colour. For this reason, and because the large number and contrasting colour of the cells usually make them very easy to visualise, melanophores {{are by far the}} most widely studied <b>chromatophore.</b> However, there are differences between the biology of melanophores and that of melanocytes.

Using the same technique, the H+/H− ratio was close to 1. 0 for these proteoliposomes.

25|$|Pigment {{cells that}} exhibit {{fluorescence}} are called fluorescent chromatophores, and function somatically similar to regular chromatophores.

25|$|Colour change permits {{camouflage}} against different backgrounds. In {{the context}} of deception, this {{can be used as}} a defence or predatory strategy, or during courtship and mating. Colour change is made possible by chromatophores; pigment-containing and light-reflecting organelles in cells found in amphibians, fish, reptiles, crustaceans and cephalopods. Inside the <b>chromatophore</b> cell of cephalopods, pigment granules are enclosed in an elastic sac. To change colour, the animal distorts the sac by muscular contraction, changing its translucency, reflectivity or opacity. This differs from the mechanism used in fish, amphibians and reptiles, in that the shape of the sac is being changed rather than a translocation of pigment vesicles within the cell.|$|E
25|$|Many {{species are}} able to {{translocate}} the pigment inside their chromatophores, resulting in an apparent change in body colour. This process, known as physiological colour change, is most widely studied in melanophores, since melanin is the darkest and most visible pigment. In most species with a relatively thin dermis, the dermal melanophores tend to be flat and cover a large surface area. However, in animals with thick dermal layers, such as adult reptiles, dermal melanophores often form three-dimensional units with other chromatophores. These dermal <b>chromatophore</b> units (DCU) consist of an uppermost xanthophore or erythrophore layer, then an iridophore layer, and finally a basket-like melanophore layer with processes covering the iridophores.|$|E

In the photosynthetic system, addition of {{increasing amounts of}} DCCD inhibits, with a similar titre, both proton permeability and MgATP-dependent ATPase activity as detected in the dark. The titre for 50 % inhibition coincides with that obtained measuring proton permeability and ATP hydrolysis in ESMP. Upon removal of F 1, the passive proton permeability is much less sensitive to DCCD in <b>chromatophores</b> than in USMP, suggesting that in <b>chromatophores</b> the F 1 −F 0. interaction shapes the DCCD-sensitive proton conducting pathway. Addition of the purified mitochondrial FoI-PVP and oligomycin sensitivity-conferring (OSCP) proteins to the F 1 stripped <b>chromatophores</b> restored the sensitivity of proton permeability to DCCD detected in untreated <b>chromatophores.</b> Analysis of the binding of 14 C[DCCD] on F 1 stripped <b>chromatophores</b> shows that the increase of DCCD sensitivity of proton permeability, caused by addition of mitochondrial Fo proteins, is related to an increase of the binding of the inhibitor to subunit c of Fo sector of ATP synthase complex...|$|R
