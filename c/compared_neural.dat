40|$|SummaryThe dorsolateral {{prefrontal cortex}} and {{posterior}} parietal cortex have been implicated in the planning of movements and inhibition of inappropriate responses, though their precise roles in these functions are not known. To address this question, we trained monkeys to perform memory-guided saccade and anti-saccade tasks and <b>compared</b> <b>neural</b> responses in the same animals. A population of neurons with no motor responses was also activated by a stimulus appearing out of the receptive field and could therefore mediate vector inversion. These neurons were found almost exclusively in the prefrontal cortex. Prefrontal cortical activity better predicted the level of performance in the task. Representation of the saccade goal also peaked in the prefrontal cortex {{at a time that}} was predictive of reaction time. These results suggest that the prefrontal cortex is the primary site of vector inversion in the cerebral cortex and explain the importance of this area in response inhibition...|$|E

40|$|SummaryBeta {{oscillations}} in cortical-basal ganglia (BG) circuits {{have been}} implicated in normal movement suppression and motor impairment in Parkinson's disease. To dissect the functional correlates of these rhythms we <b>compared</b> <b>neural</b> activity during four distinct variants of a cued choice task in rats. Brief beta (∼ 20  Hz) oscillations occurred simultaneously throughout the cortical-BG network, both spontaneously and at precise moments of task performance. Beta phase was rapidly reset in response to salient cues, yet increases in beta power were not rigidly linked to cues, movements, or movement suppression. Rather, beta power was enhanced after cues {{were used to determine}} motor output. We suggest that beta oscillations reflect a postdecision stabilized state of cortical-BG networks, which normally reduces interference from alternative potential actions. The abnormally strong beta seen in Parkinson's Disease may reflect overstabilization of these networks, producing pathological persistence of the current motor state...|$|E

Few studies, however, have directly <b>compared</b> <b>neural</b> activation during live interaction to conventional recorded paradigms. The current study used a novel fMRI paradigm to investigate whether real-time social interaction modulates the neural correlates of language processing and mentalizing. Regions associated with social engagement (i. e., dorsal medial prefrontal cortex) were more active during live interaction. Processing live versus recorded language increased activation in regions associated with narrative processing and mentalizing (i. e., temporal parietal junction). Regions associated with intentionality understanding (i. e., posterior superior temporal sulcus) were more active when mentalizing about a live partner. These results have implications for quantifying and understanding the neural correlates of real-world social behavior in typical adults, in developmental populations, and in individuals with social disabilities such as autism...|$|E

40|$|This event-related {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging study <b>compared</b> <b>neural</b> correlates of executive function (cognitive setshifting) in 28 healthy participants with either high (HIQ) or average (AIQ) intelligence. Despite comparable behavioral performance (except for slower reactions), the AIQ participants showed greater (especially prefrontal) activation during response selection; the HIQ participants showed greater activation (especially parietal) during feedback evaluation. HIQ participants appeared to engage cognitive resources to support more efficient strategies (planning during feedback in preparation for the upcoming response) which resulted in faster responses and less need for response inhibition and conflict resolution. Whether greater intelligence is associated with more or less brain activity (the ‘‘neural efficiency’ ’ debate) depends therefore on the specific component of the task being examined as well as the brain region recruited. One implication is that caution must be exercised when drawing conclusions from differences in activation between groups of individuals in whom IQ may differ (e. g., psychiatric vs. control samples) ...|$|E

40|$|Flexible {{control of}} {{cognition}} bestows a remarkable adaptability {{to a broad}} range of contexts. While cognitive control is known to rely on frontoparietal neural architecture to achieve this flexibility, the neural mechanisms that allow such adaptability to context are poorly understood.

We report evidence of the involvement of multiple frequency bands during preparation and implementation of cognitive control. Specifically, a common frontoparietal delta and a central alpha process corresponded to rule implementation and motor response respectively. Interestingly, we found evidence of a frontal theta signature that was sensitive to increasing amounts of information and a posterior parietal alpha process only seen during anticipatory rule updating. Importantly, these neural signatures of context processing match proposed frontal hierarchies of control and together provide novel evidence of a complex interplay of multiple frequency bands underpinning flexible, contextually sensitive cognition...|$|E

Efforts {{have been made}} to make the system language independent, automatic, robust and able to generate multiple pronunciations. The learner proposes initial pronunciations for the words and finds transformations that bring the pronunciations closer to the correct pronunciations. The pronunciation generator works by applying the transformations to a similar initial pronunciation. A dynamic aligner is used for the necessary alignment of phonemes and graphemes. The pronunciations are scored using a weighed string edit distance. Optimizations were made to make the learner and the rule applier fast. The system achieves 73. 9 % exact word accuracy with multiple pronunciations, 82. 3 % word accuracy with one correct pronunciation, and 95. 3 % phoneme accuracy for English words.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{flexibly}} respond {{to changes in}} the environment is critical for adaptive behavior. Reversal learning (RL) procedures test adaptive response updating when contingencies are altered. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine brain areas that support specific RL components. We <b>compared</b> <b>neural</b> responses to RL and initial learning (acquisition) to isolate reversal-related brain activation independent of cognitive control processes invoked during initial feedback-based learning. Lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) was more activated during reversal than acquisition, suggesting its relevance for reformation of established stimulus [...] response associations. In addition, the dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) and right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) correlated with change in postreversal accuracy. Because optimal RL likely requires suppression of a prior learned response, we hypothesized that similar regions serve both response inhibition (RI) and inhibition of learned associations during reversal. However, reversal-specific responding and stopping (requiring RI and assessed via the stop-signal task) revealed distinct frontal regions. Although RI-related regions do not appear to support inhibition of prepotent learned associations, a subset of these regions, dACC and rIFG, guide actions consistent with current reward contingencies. These regions and lateral OFC represent distinct neural components that support behavioral flexibility important for adaptive learning...|$|E

To study amygdala dysfunction, we examined neural mechanisms mediating face processing in 22 youths (mean age 14. 21 ± 3. 11 yr) with BD and 21 controls of comparable age, gender, and IQ. Event-related functional MRI <b>compared</b> <b>neural</b> activation when attention was directed to emotional aspects of faces (hostility, subjects’ fearfulness) vs. nonemotional aspects (nose width).
