40|$|This paper investigates mean areal {{precipitation}} (MAP) climatology {{and tests}} {{the performance of}} quantita-tive precipitation forecasts (QPFs) issued by the National Weather Service Forecast Office at Morristown, TN (MRX) across the hydrologic service area (HSA). Results obtained are considered preliminary, as the time period under {{study was limited to}} 8. 5 months (from mid-December 1998 through August 1999). Secondly, although opera-tional QPF products are now issued from the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center (HPC) of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), this paper focuses on the short-term (1 - 6 hour) QPF prob-lem where National Weather Service, Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) can provide valuable insight. QPFs demonstrated more skill (or lower error) when lighter rainfall events occurred. During the summer sea-son, mean absolute error (MAE) of QPF was higher for nearly all prescribed ranges of MAP, citing the convective QPF as most problematic. MAP climatology, which iden-tified the southeastern MRX HSA for more significant rainfall, was strongly influenced by synoptic-scale systems producing upslope flow events. Thus, the <b>climatological</b> <b>MAP</b> was divided into synoptic- and convective-scale (or bimodal) precipitation events. Results obtained for heavy rainfall cases (6 -hour MAPs ~ 0. 50 in.) using this approach revealed different spatial precipitation patterns, each owing to a different dependence meteorologically. For diurnal convective systems, a temporal link was observed between frequency maxima and high levels of MAE along two interfaces: the Great Tennessee Valley and the adja-cent Appalachian Mountains to the east, and, for synoptic systems, the largest frequency gradient and MAE occurred along the n 01 thern inteliace. 1...|$|E
40|$|In this article, {{we present}} the first <b>climatological</b> <b>map</b> of air–sea CO 2 flux over the Baltic Sea based on remote sensing data: {{estimates}} of p CO 2 derived from satellite imaging using self-organizing map classifications along with class-specific linear regressions (SOMLO methodology) and remotely sensed wind estimates. The estimates have a spatial resolution of 4  km both in {{latitude and longitude}} and a monthly temporal resolution from 1998 to 2011. The CO 2 fluxes are estimated using two types of wind products, i. e. reanalysis winds and satellite wind products, the higher-resolution wind product generally leading to higher-amplitude flux estimations. Furthermore, the CO 2 fluxes were also estimated using two methods: the method of Wanninkhof et al. (2013) and the method of Rutgersson and Smedman (2009). The seasonal variation in fluxes reflects the seasonal variation in p CO 2 unvaryingly over the whole Baltic Sea, with high winter CO 2 emissions and high p CO 2 uptakes. All basins act {{as a source for}} the atmosphere, with a higher degree of emission in the southern regions (mean source of 1. 6  mmol m − 2  d − 1 for the South Basin and 0. 9 for the Central Basin) than in the northern regions (mean source of 0. 1  mmol m − 2  d − 1) and the coastal areas act as a larger sink (annual uptake of − 4. 2  mmol m − 2  d − 1) than does the open sea (− 4  mmol m − 2  d − 1).

40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{procedure}} for producing daily cloud-free maps of surface water {{temperature in the}} Great Lakes has been developed. It is based on satellite-derived AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) imagery from NOAA’s CoastWatch program. The maps have a nominal resolution of 2. 6 km and provide as complete as possible coverage of the Great Lakes {{on a daily basis}} by using previous imagery to estimate temperatures in cloud covered areas. Surface water temperature estimates derived from this procedure compare well with water temperatures measured at the eight NOAA weather buoys in the lakes. The mean difference between the buoy temperature and the satellite-derived temperature esti-mates is less than 0. 5 °C for all buoys. The root mean square differences range from 1. 10 to 1. 76 °C. As one example of the possible applications of this product, the daily surface water temperature maps for 1992 to 1997 were analyzed to produce daily estimates of average surface water temperature for each lake. Results are compared to the long-term (28 year) mean annual cycle of average surface water tem-peratures. The average surface water temperatures vary from as much as 4 °C below climatology in 1993 to 2 to 3 °C above climatology in 1995. The new analysis procedure also provides a more realistic depic-tion of the spatial distribution of temperature in the springtime than the <b>climatological</b> <b>maps...</b>|$|R

The selection of suitable geographical units, where this approach should be taken, requires the assessment of ecological provinces, characterized by a coherent set of environmental traits. On the sea side of the coast, where the interaction between atmosphere, land and sea is not bounded by evident geographic markers, the application of remote sensing and modelling can be exploited to characterize the status and trends of marine ecosystems, starting with the recognition of near-coastal eco-regions. <b>Climatological</b> <b>maps</b> derived from satellite observations and model simulations were used to assess the space-time heterogeneity of atmospheric forcing, vertical mixing and algal blooming of the Ligurian-Provençal Sea, in the north-western Mediterranean basin, over 10 consecutive annual cycles (1997 ¿ 2007). The ecosystem response to changing seasonal conditions was traced in the Gulf of Lion (40. 5 ¿ 42. 5 °N, 3. 5 ¿ 7. 5 °E), where wind forcing causes deep convective processes and consequent nutrient upwelling in the water column. The lag between forcing and blooming shows that the biological response of the ecosystem is not instantaneous, after the set up of conditions favourable to algal growth, and that the it depends on the pre-conditioning fostered by a prolongued period of vertical mixing.

The implementation of a simple land surface parameterization, Interactions between Soil Biosphere Atmosphere (ISBA), has gained from previous validations and calibrations at local scale against field datasets and from aggregation procedures devised to define effective land surface properties. Specific improvements for climate purposes are introduced: spatial variability of convective rainfall in canopy drainage estimation and subsurface gravitational percolation. The methodology used to derive <b>climatological</b> <b>maps</b> of land surface parameters at the grid-scale resolution of the model from existing database for soil and vegetation types at global scale is described. A 3 -yr integration for the present day climate with a T 42 L 30 version of the climate model has been performed.

40|$|Many {{empirical}} {{models and}} climatologies of high-latitude ionospheric processes, such as convection, {{have been developed}} over the last 40 years. One common feature {{in the development of}} these models is that measurements from different times are combined and averaged on fixed coordinate grids. This methodology ignores the reality that high-latitude ionospheric features are organized relative to the location of the ionospheric footprint of the boundary between open and closed geomagnetic field lines (OCB). This boundary is in continual motion, and the polar cap that it encloses is continually expanding and contracting in response to changes in the rates of magnetic reconnection at the Earth's magnetopause and in the magnetotail. As a consequence, models that are developed by combining and averaging data in fixed coordinate grids heavily smooth the variations that occur near the boundary location. Here we propose that the development of future models should consider the location of the OCB in order to more accurately model the variations in this region. We present a methodology which involves identifying the OCB from spacecraft auroral images and then organizing measurements in a grid where the bins are placed relative to the OCB location. We demonstrate the plausibility of this methodology using ionospheric vorticity measurements made by the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network radars and OCB measurements from the IMAGE spacecraft FUV auroral imagers.

Examination of our satellite images found the most prominent large-scale patch of elevated aerosol radiances in each month {{off the coast of}} northwest Africa. The well-known, large-scale plumes of elevated aerosol levels in the Arabian Sea, the northwest Pacific, and off the east coast of North America were also successfully captured. Radiance data were extracted from 13 major open-ocean zones, ranging from the subpolar to equatorial regions. Results from these extractions revealed the aerosol load in both subpolar and subtropical zones to be higher in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere. Aerosol radiances in the subtropics of both hemispheres were about 2 times higher in summer than in winter. In subpolar regions, aerosol radiances in late spring/early summer were almost 3 times that observed in winter. In general, the aerosol signal was higher during the warmer months and lower during the cooler months, irrespective of location. A comparison between our mean monthly aerosol radiance maps with mean monthly chlorophyll maps (also from CZCS) showed similar seasonality between aerosol and chlorophyll levels in the subpolar zones of both hemispheres, i. e., high levels in summer, low levels in winter. In the subtropics of both hemispheres, however, chlorophyll levels were higher in winter months which coincided with a depressed aerosol signal.

40|$|Density {{variations}} {{along the}} western and eastern boundaries of an ocean basin {{play an important role}} in constraining the meridional overturning circulation (MOC). <b>Climatological</b> <b>maps</b> of hydrographic properties along the sloping western and eastern boundaries of the Atlantic reveal a clear asymmetry. Along the western boundary a systematic north-south gradient in neutral density is found, associated with the large-scale MOC; in contrast, along the eastern boundary, netural density surfaces are virtually flat, consistent with classical ideas about the inability of eastern boundaries to support large-scale horizontal pressure gradients. This asymmetry breaks down in the bottom layers where Antarctic Bottom Water spreads northwards as topographic slope currents. Similar pictures are found in the Pacific and Indian basins, except that the western boundary variations in neutral density are much reduced due to the absence of significant meridioinal overturning. Moreover, recent theoretical and modelling results will be discussed which suggest that this asymmetry carries over interannual variability in density variations {{along the western}} and eastern boundaries and hence the MOC. The above serves as the motivation for the WAVE (Western Atlantic Variability Experiment) array deployed in 2004 at three locations along the western margin of the deep North Atlantic, as part of prototype MOC monitoing array developed under the UK RAPID program. The array consists of three lines of bottom pressure recorders, inverted echo sounders and moorings. The aims are to identify how changes in the circulation of the deep western boundary current are communicated from their high latitude sources along the western margin of the North Atlantic, and to test a fundamental assumption of any practical monitoring system for the North Atlantic MOC - that a substantial component of the changes in circulation is coherent across latitude circles. The relation of the RAPID arrays to the wider international MOC monitoring system emerging under the CLIVAR umbrella will be discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} defines new {{interpolation}} functions for hydrological data. These functions {{are applied to}} generate <b>climatological</b> <b>maps</b> of temperature-salinity distribution with a 25 m depth interval and a 30 km space interval (MEDTRANS data set). The data undergo rigorous initial data quality control, having passed several filtering procedures. The gridding is done on neutral density surfaces, which allows better representation of thermohaline fronts for the same gridding radius. The multi-pass Barnes optimum interpolation procedure with spatially variable size of the gridding window is used. The shape of the window accounts for the dominant along-isobath direction of water mass transport over steeply sloping topography. A local ratio of topographic to planetary beta-effects is used to define {{the shape of the}} window {{as a function of the}} relative importance of the topographic influence. The N / f ratio is applied to account for the baroclinic compensation decay of the topographic influence on water mass transport with the distance from the bottom. The gridded fields are available at the website of the Centre of Oceanography of the University of Lisbon ([URL] The MEDTRANS climatology gives more details of the distribution of water characteristics in the subtropical northeastern Atlantic than other alternative climatologies and is able to reproduce a number of dynamic features described in the literature: the acceleration in the meanders of the Azores current; the cyclonic gyre in the Gulf of Cadiz; and the splitting and separation of the Mediterranean Water (MW) out-flow in two veins near the Gorringe and Galicia banks.

40|$|Hostýnské {{mountains}} {{are part of}} the most frequently visited forests in Moravia. Whether because of the numerous cottage and recreational areas with abundant occurrence of fungi, these forests were subject to great anthropogenic influence since its origin. Therefore, it was created on the territory of several protected areas and nature reserves, which were designed to preserve the natural vegetation potential of local vegetation and protection of rare species of local phytomass and zoomass. The goal of this thesis is the verification of the respective forest vegetation zones of the investigated plots, which had been historically assigned in several respects. In the past, namely the allocation of forest vegetation zone was entirely an empirical matter, which scientists {{have not been able to}} verify the correctness of his judgment by means of statistical analysis, as is the case nowadays. The plots were therefore selected to characterize best the local conditions, whether in terms of species composition of vegetation or climatic conditions. On the 20 selected plots there were collected data within individual tree layers (based on Kraft-Zlatník scale), species composition and level of development of individual trees by circuits measured at breast height and height measurements according to average individuals. As additional data for the overall evaluation were used <b>climatological</b> <b>maps</b> using GIS software creating a mosaics from which it can be acknowledged how much of the forest stands is affected by abiotic factors such as the length of the snow or the average air temperature. The data assembling the complete image of the plot characteristics were subsequently analysed by regression and multivariete statistical analysis. The obtained results show the context between the actual stage of the forest stands and the used climatic parameters. I believe that this work could be a model for those who do not rely on empiricallly-derived forestry maps and admit that the overall climate in our country is changing and evolving. It is therefore important to consider these causes not only for the purposes of forest management, but also for the protection of existing vegetation...|$|R
40|$|Spatial {{interpolation}} {{of observations}} {{on a regular}} grid is a common task in many ceanographic disciplines (and geosciences in general). It {{is often used to}} create <b>climatological</b> <b>maps</b> for physical, biological or chemical parameters representing e. g. monthly or seasonally averaged fields. Since instantaneous observations can not be directly related to a field representing an average, simple spatial interpolation of observations is in general not acceptable. Diva (Data-Interpolating Variational Analysis) is an analysis tool which takes the error in the observations and the typical spatial scale of the underlying field into account. Barriers due to the coastline and the topography in general and also currents estimates (if available) are used to propagate the information of a given observation spatially. Diva is a command-line driven application written in Fortran and Shell Scripts. The observations and parameters are specified by the user using text files. The analyzed field and the expected error variance are returned as NetCDF files. This form of interaction with Diva is very similar to other high-performance codes and is a familiar approach for ocean modelers. However it represents a steep learning curve for oceanographers from other disciplines not familiar with command-line applications and programming. To make Diva easier to use, a web interface has been developed ([URL] Installation and compilation of Diva is therefore not required. The user can directly upload his/her data in ASCII format and enter several parameters for the analysis. The analyzed field, location of the observations, and the error mask are presented as different layers using the Web Map Service protocol. They are visualized in the browser using the Javascript library OpenLayers allowing the user to interact with layers (for example zooming and panning). Finally, the results can be downloaded as a NetCDF file, Matlab file (also readable in Octave, an open source program similar to Matlab) and Keyhole Markup Language (KML) file for visualisation in applications such as Google Earth...|$|R

40|$|SMOS+SOS Ocean Salinity Science and Salinity Remote Sensing Workshop, 26 - 28 {{november}} 2014, Exeter, United Kingdom. [...] 1 pagePresent {{remote sensing}} estimates of sea surface salinity {{are based on}} L-band measurements from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and the Aquarius missions. Ocean remote sensing at L-band is challenging as the signal is affected by many external noise sources and processing issues, notably for SMOS (e. g., radio-frequency-interference sources, Land-sea contamination, latitudinal biases, etc.), that undermine {{the quality of the}} final products. Direct comparisons with in situ measurements provide information on point-wise deviations in remote sensing sea surface salinity (SSS) maps, but not on their geophysical consistence. A method to characterize geophysical structures in SSS maps in a systematic way by means of the singularity analysis technique is proposed. Singularity analysis is very sensitive to artifacts and to correlated noise, while filtering uncorrelated noise and revealing coherent structures in ocean maps of different variables. The method allows not only to obtain a qualitative assessment of the quality of SSS maps but also to quantify their closeness to an appropriate template of geophysical structures (e. g., derived from accurate high-level SST maps). The method is used both to improve the L-band processing algorithms and to perform oceanographic process studies. For example, the method is able to assess the quality associated with different ways of processing SMOS data. In particular, the distribution of SMOS measurement errors is shown to be strongly non-Gaussian and hence non-linear filtering must be applied to optimize the quality of SSS maps. Singularity-based quality assessment shows that the new SSS mapscontain geophysical coherent structures (mainly eddies and filaments), which are not present in the corresponding <b>climatological</b> <b>maps</b> and less evident in the standard SSS products. Moreover, the latter contain artifacts not seen in the new product. The new SSS maps can then be used to assess the presence of haline fronts, the position of temperature fronts, and the propagation of tropical instability waves, as well as to track strong river discharges in the ocean. These maps will also be used to discuss the evolution of the currently expected 2014 El Niño eventPeer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The UK National Oceanography Centre has {{maintained}} an observatory in Liverpool Bay since August 2002. Over 8 years of observational measurements {{are used in}} conjunction with regional ocean modelling data to describe the physical and dynamical oceanography of Liverpool Bay and to validate the regional model, POLCOMS. Tidal dynamics and plume buoyancy govern the fate of the fresh water as it enters the sea, as well as the fate of its sediment, contaminants and nutrient loads. In this context, an overview and summary of Liverpool Bay tidal dynamics are presented. Freshwater forcing statistics are presented showing that on average the bay receives 233 m 3 s - 1. Though the region is salinity controlled, river input temperature is shown to significantly modulate the plume buoyancy with a seasonal cycle. Stratification strongly influences the region's dynamics. Data from long-term moored instrumentation are used to analyse the stratification statistics that are representative of the region. It is shown that for 65 % of tidal cycles, the region alternates between being vertically mixed and stratified. Plume dynamics are diagnosed from the model and are presented for the region. The spring-neap modulation of the plume's westward extent, between 3. 5 ° W and 4 ° W, is highlighted. The rapid eastward erosion of the plume during spring tides is identified as a potentially important freshwater mixing mechanism. Novel <b>climatological</b> <b>maps</b> of temperature, salinity and density from the CTD surveys are presented and used to validate numerical simulations. The model is found {{to be sensitive to the}} freshwater forcing rates, temperature and salinities. The existing CTD survey grid is shown to not extend sufficiently near the coast to capture the near coastal and vertically mixed component the plume. Instead the survey grid captures the westward spreading, shallow and transient, portion of the plume. This transient plume feature is shown in both the long-term averaged model and observational data as a band of stratified fluid stretching between the mouth of the Mersey towards the Isle of Man. Finally the residual circulation is discussed. Long-term moored ADCP data are favourably compared with model data, showing the general northward flow of surface water and southward trajectory of bottom wate...|$|R
40|$|Regional {{relationships}} {{to estimate the}} main Phytoplankton Functional Types (PFTs) and Size Classes (PSCs) from satellite data are presented. Following the abundance-based approach and selecting the Total Chlorophyll a (TChla) as descriptor of the trophic status of the environment, empirical relations between the TChla concentration and seven accessory pigments, marker for the main algal groups, {{have been developed for}} the Mediterranean Sea. Using only in-situ data acquired in this basin, firstly a previous regional diagnostic pigment analysis has been conducted to evaluate the specific pigment ratios featuring the phytoplankton assemblage that occurs in the Mediterranean Sea. Secondly, the new regional PFT and PSC algorithms have been calibrated and validated on the in-situ dataset. The statistical analysis showed a very good predictive power for all the new regional models. A quantitative comparison with global abundance-based models applied to our validation dataset showed that the regionalization improves the uncertainty and the spread of about one order of magnitude for all the classes (e. g., in the nano class, where the mean bias error improves from − 0. 056 to 0. 001 mg m− 3). These results highlighted that a regionalization for the PSC and PFT estimates are required, {{to take into account the}} peculiar bio-optical properties of the Mediterranean Sea. Finally, the new regional equations have been applied to the Mediterranean TChla satellite (1998 – 2015) time series to estimate annual and monthly PFT and PSC climatology. The analysis of the <b>climatological</b> <b>maps,</b> relative to the phytoplankton assemblage distribution patterns, reveals that all the three size classes reach their maxima in the higher nutrient areas, with absolute values > 3 mg m− 3 of TChla for micro-, and about 1. 6 and 0. 4 mg m− 3 for nano- and pico-phytoplankton, respectively. Moreover, the nano component shows intermediate percentage values in the whole basin, ranging from 30 to 40 % of the TChla in the western basin, up to 45 % in the more productive areas. In terms of chlorophyll concentration, in the coastal areas we find the predominance of the Diatoms and Haptophytes, while in the ultra-oligotrophic waters Prokaryotes predominates on the other groups, constituting the principal component of the pico-phytoplankton...|$|R

40|$|Carbonates are {{the largest}} {{reservoirs}} of carbon on Earth. From mid-Mesozoic time, the biologically catalyzed precipitation of calcium carbonates by pelagic phytoplankton has been primarily due {{to the production of}} calcite by coccolithophorids. In this paper we address the physical and chemical processes that select for coccolithophorid blooms detected in Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) ocean color imagery. Our primary goal is to develop both diagnostic and prognostic models that represent the spatial and temporal dynamics of coccolithophorid blooms in order to improve our knowledge of the role of these organisms in mediating fluxes of carbon between the ocean, the atmosphere, and the lithosphere. On the basis of monthly composite images of classified coccolithophorid blooms and global <b>climatological</b> <b>maps</b> of physical variables and nutrient fields, we developed a probability density function that accounts for the physical chemical variables that predict the spatiotemporal distribution of coccolithophorids in the world oceans. Our analysis revealed that areas with sea surface temperatures (SST) between 3 ° and 15 °C, a critical irradiance between 25 and 150 µmol quanta m- 2 s- 1, and decreasing nitrate concentrations (N/t < 0) are selective for upper ocean large-scale coccolithophorid blooms. While these conditions favor both Northern and Southern Hemisphere blooms of the most abundant coccolithophorid in the modern oceans, Emiliania huxleyi, the Northern and Southern Hemisphere populations of this organism are genetically distinct. Applying amplified fragment length polymorphism as a marker of genetic diversity, we identified two major taxonomic clades of E. huxleyi; one is associated with the Northern Hemisphere blooms, while the other is found in the Southern Hemisphere. We suggest a rule of “universal distribution and local selection”: that is, coccolithophorids can be considered cosmopolitan taxa, but their genetic plasticity provides physiological accommodation to local environmental selection pressure. Sea surface temperature, critical irradiance, and N/t were predicted for the years 2060 – 2070 using the NCAR Community Climate System Model to generate future monthly probability distributions of coccolithophorids based upon the relationships observed between the environmental variables and coccolithophorid blooms in modern oceans. Our projected probability distribution analysis suggests that in the North Atlantic, the largest habitat for coccolithophorids on Earth, the areal extent of blooms will decrease by up to 50 % by the middle of this century. We discuss how the magnitude of carbon fluxes may be affected by the evolutionary success of coccolithophorids in future climate scenarios...|$|R
