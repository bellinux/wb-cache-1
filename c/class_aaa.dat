5000|$|In {{addition}} to the major leagues, many North American cities and towns feature minor league teams. An organization officially styled Minor League Baseball, formerly the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, oversees nearly all minor league baseball in the United States and Canada. The minor leagues are divided into <b>classes</b> <b>AAA,</b> AA, High A, Low A, Short-Season A, Advanced Rookie, and Rookie. These minor-league divisions are affiliated with major league teams, and serve to develop young players and rehabilitate injured major-leaguers.

50|$|A tie can {{be broken}} {{in one of two}} ways: A sudden death shoot-off, used at all National and large {{regional}} competitions and for the overall match winner. Master <b>class</b> and <b>AAA</b> shooters would shoot at Turkeys, AA class shoot at Rams, A shoots at Chickens and B class shoots at Pigs. To save time and effort, a reverse animal count can also be used (number of hits on hardest animal to easiest), Whoever hits the most Turkeys would be the winner. If a tie still exists whoever hit the most Rams would be the winner. This would continue to Chickens and finally Pigs.|$|R

5|$|Considered the fourth-best {{prospect}} {{in baseball}} by Baseball America {{heading into the}} 1995 season, the Yankees projected Jeter as their starting shortstop.

As a precaution, the Yankees signed Tony Fernández to a two-year contract. With Fernández the starting shortstop, the Yankees assigned Jeter to <b>Class</b> <b>AAA.</b> During the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike, Gene Michael, the Yankees' general manager, offered Jeter the opportunity to work out for the MLB team with replacement players in spring training before the 1995 season.

Campanella hit 13 home runs in 35 games and fans were dismayed when he was called up to the Dodgers. The 1949 Saints finished with a 93-60 record and four of its players collected more than 90 runs batted in (RBI). The team finished in first place, half a game in front of Indianapolis.

50|$|Marching band classifications {{are based}} on the number of marching members within each ensemble, {{including}} percussion and auxiliary/color guard. A fourth competitive class is available for those bands who wish to compete regardless of band size. Each year minor adjustments are voted on by members to keep the number of competing bands among the size-based classes roughly even. Revised in 2012, the <b>AAA</b> <b>class</b> was removed from classification to balance the band competition to similar sized bands. This was done because many of the bands who would have been classified as AAA elected to compete in Open class, leaving very few in the <b>AAA</b> <b>class.</b> Prior to 2009, Novice class was available to marching bands with no previous competitive experience. An Exhibition or festival class is available to visiting bands who wish to take advantage of performance opportunities at circuit events which include comments from adjudicators.
