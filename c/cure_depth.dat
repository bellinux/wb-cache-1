40|$|Direct digital {{manufacturing}} {{of ceramic}} parts is possible using focused ultraviolet (UV) light to pattern photopolymerizable ceramic suspensions. Ultimate spatial resolution {{is limited by}} the size of the UV beam. This dissertation focuses on other limiting factors. First, machine parameters and software can limit practical resolution of the processes. Second, if particle settling occurs, this can change the curing parameters. The effects of sedimentation on curing are modeled by combining the absorption model of sensitivity, the inhibitor exhaustion model for critical energy dose, and the Richardson-Zaki model of Stokes’ settling for monodisperse spheres. Finally, resolution can also be limited by “broadening”, where the width of a cured line is larger than the size of the UV beam. To understand the physics of broadening, the effect of energy dose on the <b>cure</b> <b>depth</b> and cure width was determined. It is shown that the <b>cure</b> <b>depth</b> fits the expected Beer-Lambert behavior, where <b>cure</b> <b>depth</b> increases with the logarithm of energy and is described by the sensitivity and critical energy dose. The broadening can be described by the excess width, which fits a quasi-Beer-Lambert behavior as well. The absorption model predicts the effect of photoinitiator and dye on the <b>cure</b> <b>depth,</b> and this model can also be used to describe the excess width. Similarly, the inhibitor exhaustion model predictions for depth can be used to describe the excess width. The broadening depth is defined as the depth of cure when broadening begins. This is given by the <b>cure</b> <b>depth</b> where the energy dose is equal to the width critical energy dose. Below this broadening depth, no broadening is expected. It is shown that the broadening depth is proportional to the logarithm of the refractive index contrast between the ceramic powder and the liquids in solution. The role of contrast is understood in terms of the total path length in the absorption model using a random walk model. Tracing the photon paths using a hindered random walk model provides insight into the broadening behavior. Accounting for the angular distributions of scattering angles shows that broadening occurs at the expense of the <b>cure</b> <b>depth...</b>|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the relationship between the light intensity of light-curing units in the Department of Operative Dentistry of Isfahan Faculty of Dentistry and the <b>curing</b> <b>depth</b> according to ISO 4049 standards and also to compare the primary and final light densities of the units. Materials and Methods: In this in vitro study, first the light intensities of 9 light-curing units of the Department of Operative Dentistry were measured by a radiometer. According to ISO 4049 if the intensity of the light-curing unit was higher than 200 mW/cm 2, the unit was used to cure five samples of Z 100 composite resin. A total of 7 units were used to cure 35 specimens. The exposure time of the units with 200 - 300 mW/cm 2 light intensity was twice those of units with over 300 mW/cm 2. The uncured composite resins were removed by scraping and half of the least remaining composite resin thickness was recorded as the <b>curing</b> <b>depth.</b> Finally the light intensity of each unit was measured again. Data was analyzed with SPSS using t-test and correlation coefficient (α = 0. 05). Results: The light intensity of light-curing units was 40 ‒ 620 mW/cm 2 : four units with above 300 mW/cm 2; three with 200 - 300 mW/cm 2 and two with less than 200 mW/cm 2. Only two light-curing units exhibited significant differences between primary and final light intensities (p value < 0. 001). The correlation coefficient between the light intensity and <b>curing</b> <b>depth</b> was 0. 58.

This is the very first application of a Blu-ray OPU to a light source of a MSTL system. A three-axis stage was adopted to obtain 3 D motions, and a simple optic system was added to extend the focal length of a Blu-ray OPU for avoiding the physical interference. A liquid photo-curable resin suitable for the system was recomposed by modifying previously reported one. Then, the fabrication characteristics were investigated by constructing single-line structures at varying parameters such as laser power, scan speed and aperture diameter. The <b>cured</b> <b>depth</b> and width of the single-line structures decreased as the irradiated energy, which is determined by laser power and scan speed, decreased.

40|$|Large Area Maskless Photopolymerization (LAMP) is a {{technology}} being developed to fabricate integrally-cored ceramic molds for the investment casting of turbine airfoils. In LAMP, ultraviolet (UV) {{light in the}} form of bitmap images is projected from a spatial light modulator (SLM) onto a photocurable ceramic material system (PCMS). Exposed and unexposed regions are determined through black and white portions of the bitmaps, respectively. UV light induces photopolymerization and the formation of an insoluble solidified network. Three-dimensional structures are built layer-by-layer through sequential application and curing of PCMS layers of 100 micron thickness. To date, ceramic molds fabricated using LAMP have been successfully implemented in investment casting of single-crystal turbine airfoils without internal cooling schemes. Two particularly important challenges for the fabrication of airfoil molds with internal cooling passages are: (a) fabrication of unsupported structures in the mold geometry and; (b) mitigation of internal stresses that arise during layer-by-layer build-up due to volumetric shrinkage during photopolymerization. Unsupported geometries arise in nearly every cored airfoil mold and often in a location where support structures cannot be easily removed after fabrication. Internal stresses generated by volumetric shrinkage can lead to cracking during binder burnout (BBO), sintering and casting. This thesis aims to simultaneously address these challenges through the investigation of grayscale exposure to control the degree of monomer conversion during photopolymerization of single and multiple layers. The effective intensity of the UV light incident on the monomer system can be reduced by selectively turning off pixels within the nominally "white" or "on" regions of the projected bitmaps, effectively producing an exposure with a lower light intensity. In an effort to reduce internal stresses in the mold, the grayscale exposure can be tuned to create regions of uncured or partially cured monomer within the mold geometry to reduce the connectivity between cured regions and thus reduce the net effect of volumetric shrinkage. Grayscale exposure {{can also be used to}} generate support structures with a low degree of polymerization to create a gel state beneath and surrounding the unsupported segments of the mold, which can be washed away after completion of mold fabrication. In order to successfully utilize grayscale techniques in LAMP, the <b>cure</b> <b>depth</b> must be predicted. This is accomplished through <b>cure</b> <b>depth</b> measurements at different exposure times to develop a "working curve. " In addition, the degree of monomer conversion and its relation to cure depths resulting from grayscale exposure must be understood. Measurements of the degree of conversion are obtained through Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Empirical models are developed and compared to theoretical predictions. Also, the scattering length pixelation model is introduced as a technique to predict the light intensity distribution within the PCMS for exposure patterns at multiple length scales. Results from these grayscale investigations are then applied to LAMP and the effectiveness of grayscale to fabricate unsupported geometries and internal stresses from volumetric shrinkage is discussed.

This controlled study aimed to evaluate whether or not disposable transparent barriers placed over the light-guide tip would affect light output intensity or the subsequent depth of cure of a composite restoration. METHODS The impact on light intensity emitted from high-, medium- and low-output light-cure units {{in the presence of}} two commercially available disposable infection-control barriers was evaluated against a no-barrier control. Power density measurements from the three intensity light-cure units were recorded with a radiometer, then converted to a digital image using an intra-oral camera and values determined using a commercial computer program. For each curing unit, the measurements were repeated on ten separate occasions with each barrier and the control. Depth of cure was evaluated using a scrape test in a natural tooth model. RESULTS At each level of light output, the two disposable barriers produced a significant reduction in the mean power density readings compared to the no-barrier control (P< 0. 005). The cure sleeve inhibited light output {{to a greater extent than}} either the cling film or the control (P< 0. 005). Only composite restorations light-activated by the high level unit demonstrated a small but significant decrease in the depth of cure compared to the control (P< 0. 05).

The {{objective of this}} research is to design a satisfactory analytical and experimental model so as to determine the heat generated during the process of polymerization in the light-activated composite dental resin materials in the process of restoration of cavities in teeth. When the curing light is subjected at the top surface of the composite resin, the overall temperature at the pulp-dentine junction increases. This temperature rise is due to the generation of heat within the composite resin. The energy released by the light activation unit along with the exothermic polymerization reaction, which occurs within the monomer molecules of the resin compound, increases the temperature at the pulp-dentin junction. With the increase of the temperature beyond a certain scale (~ 20 oF),the condition of the nerves and blood vessel at the pulp-dentin junction deteriorates in 60 % of cases studied, and the pulp fails to recover from the intra-pulpal temperature increase. A major conclusion is that the restorative resin compound which produces the minimum temperature rise over the time-period of curing, ~ 40 s is the best composite to use for dental restoration purpose. In this paper the temperature rise due to polymerization for the three composite dental resins such as, 3 M TM ESPE TM Z 100 TM Restorative, Filtek TM LS Low Shrink Posterior Restorative System, and 3 MTM ESPETM Filtek Bulk Fill Flowable Restorative (assumed to be made up off 100 % resins) are measured. The <b>depth</b> of <b>curing</b> of the restorative resin is equally important as the generation of heat. If the resin is not fully cured, i. e., incomplete polymerization occurs then it can adversely affect the mechanical properties, environmental resistance, wear behavior and biocompatibility with the pulpal tissue of these restorative materials. So, the knowledge of the heat generation and <b>curing</b> <b>depth</b> are essential in determining the effectiveness of a resin from the restoration point of view. To determine the two parameters; the heat generation due to polymerization of the resins and the <b>curing</b> <b>depth,</b> a detailed literature review is done on some relating topics in Chapter 1, so as to create a foundation for the thesis problem. Analysis and experiments have been conducted. The temperature rise versus time and temperature rise versus the <b>curing</b> <b>depth</b> are measured using thermal infrared techniques. Experimental results are compared to an one-dimensional heat conduction model for which the solutions is obtained using the general integral transform method. The comparison between measurement and prediction is good from the trend and shape of the plots point of view but did not agree well {{on the basis of the}} values of temperature, time and specimen <b>depth.</b> As the <b>curing</b> <b>depth</b> of the three resins are well beyond 5 - 6 mm (practical filling depth), so all of them could be used for the dental restorative purpose.

40|$|Mask Projection micro-Stereolithography (MPμSL) is an {{additive}} manufacturing technique {{capable of producing}} solid parts with micron-scale resolution from a vat of photocurable liquid polymer resin. Although the physical mechanism remains the same, the process differs from traditional laser-galvanometer based stereolithography (SL) in its use of a dynamic mask UV projector, or digital light processor (DLP), which cures each location within each 3 D layer at the same time. One area where MPµSL has garnered considerable attention is {{in the field of}} microfluidics and Lab-on-a-Chip, where complex multistep microfabrication techniques adopted from the semiconductor industry are still widely used, and where MPµSL offers the ability to fabricate completely encapsulated fluidic channels in a single step and at low cost [1 – 3]. However, a significant obstacle exists in the prevention of channel blockage due to overcuring of the polymer resin [4, 5]. Overcuring {{can be attributed to the}} so-called ‘back side effect’ [2] which occurs during the build process as light from successive layers penetrates into the resin to a depth greater than the layer thickness. This effect is most prevalent in channels or features oriented horizontally (in a parallel plane to that of the build platform). Currently there are two main approaches in controlling the cure depth; 1. the chemical approach, which involves doping the resin material with a chemical light absorber [6 – 8]; and 2. by improving the system 2 ̆ 7 s hardware and optical elements to improve the homogeneity of the light dosage and control the <b>cure</b> <b>depth</b> [9]. Here we investigate a third approach through modification of the 3 D CAD file prior to printing to mitigate for UV light leakage from successive build layers. Although used here in conjunction with the MPμSL technique, this approach can be applied to a range of SL techniques to improve printer resolution and enable production of internal features with higher dimensional accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Mask Projection Stereolithography (MPSLA) {{is a high}} {{resolution}} manufacturing process that builds parts layer by layer in a photopolymer. In this research, a process planning method to fabricate MPSLA parts with constraints on dimensions, surface finish and build time is formulated. 	As {{a part of this}} dissertation, a MPSLA system is designed and assembled. The irradiance incident on the resin surface when a given bitmap is imaged onto it is modeled as the Irradiance model. This model is used to formulate the Bitmap generation method which generates the bitmap to be imaged onto the resin in order to cure the required layer. 	Print-through errors occur in multi-layered builds because of radiation penetrating beyond the intended thickness of a layer, causing unwanted curing. In this research, the print through errors are modeled in terms of the process parameters used to build a multi layered part. To this effect, the Transient layer cure model is formulated, that models the curing of a layer as a transient phenomenon, in which, the rate of radiation attenuation changes continuously during exposure. In addition, the effect of diffusion of radicals and oxygen on the <b>cure</b> <b>depth</b> when discrete exposure doses, as opposed to a single continuous exposure dose, are used to cure layers is quantified. The print through model is used to formulate a process planning method to cure multi-layered parts with accurate vertical dimensions. This method is demonstrated by building a test part on the MPSLA system realized as a part of this research. 	A method to improve the surface finish of down facing surfaces by modulating the exposure supplied at the edges of layers cured is formulated and demonstrated on a test part. 	The models formulated and validated in this dissertation are used to formulate a process planning method to build MPSLA parts with constraints on dimensions, surface finish and build time. The process planning method is demonstrated by means of a case study. Ph. D.

40|$|The {{technology}} of 3 D printing is conquering {{the world and}} awakens the interest of many users in the most varying of applications. New formulation approaches for photo-sensitive thiol-ene resins in combination with various printing technologies, like stereolithography (SLA), projection based printing/digital light processing (DLP) or two-photon polymerization (TPP) are presented. Thiol-ene polymerizations are known for its fast and quantitative reaction and to form highly homogeneous polymer networks. As the resins are locally and temporally photo-curable the polymerization type is very promising for 3 D-printing. By using suitable wavelengths, photoinitiator-free fabrication is feasible for single- and two photon induced polymerization. In this paper divinyl ethers of polyethylene glycols in combination with star-shaped tetrathiols were used to design a simple test-system for photo-curable thiol-ene resins. In order to control and improve <b>curing</b> <b>depth</b> and lateral resolution in 3 D-polymerization processes, either additives in chemical formulation or process parameters can be changed. The achieved <b>curing</b> <b>depth</b> and resolution limits depend on the applied fabrication method. While two-/multiphoton induced lithography offers the possibility of micron- to sub-micron resolution it lacks in built-up speed. Hence single- photon polymerization is a fast alternative with optimization potential in sub- 10 -micron resolution. Absorber- and initiator free compositions were developed {{in order to avoid}} aging, yellowing and toxicity of resulting products. They can be cured with UV-laser radiation below 300 nm. The development at Fraunhofer ILT is focusing on new applications in the field of medical products and implants, technical products with respect to mechanical properties or optical properties of 3 D-printed objects. Recent process results with model system (polyethylene glycol divinylether/Pentaerithrytol tetrakis (3 -mercaptopropionat), Raman measurements of polymer conversion and surface modifications using bifunctional crosslinkers are presented with advantages, drawbacks and a general outlook...|$|R
40|$|Statement of Problem: One of {{the factors}} {{affecting}} the degree of polymerization of light-cured composites {{is the type of}} light-curing unit used. In addition, physicomechanical properties of the composite resins depend on the degree of conversion and polymerization. Objectives: Since the type of initiator in new composite resins is not explained by manufacturers, this study is an attempt to compare the depth of hardening, with two LED and QTH light-curing units. Materials and Methods: Fifteen samples prepared from Gradia Direct and Filtek Z 250, both of which being universal, were cured with QTH (Astralis 7) and LED (Bluephase C 8) light-curing units. All the samples were molded in polyester resin and cut from the middle by a disk. The hardness of the cut area was evaluated at 0, 0. 5, 1, 1. 5, 2, 2. 5, 3, 3. 5 and 4 -mm depth intervals and also at the same interval as the width of the sample, with Vickers hardness machine, while the samples were placed in a darkroom. Data were statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA, t-test and post Hoc Tukey’s tests in SPSS, version 16. Results: Filtek Z 250 was harder than Gradia Direct at all the depth with both light-curing units. The hardness of Filtek Z 250 sample cured with Astralis 7 was higher than that cured with LED, but with Gradia Direct the LED unit resulted in higher hardness. <b>Curing</b> <b>depth</b> was not significantly different between the groups (p = 0. 109). Conclusions: Vickers hardness number for both composites used in this study is in an acceptable range for clinical implications. The composites’ composition is important to be considered for selection of light unit. Based on the findings of the present study, LED did not present more <b>curing</b> <b>depth</b> compared with QTH...|$|R
30|$|Fig. 1 c {{shows the}} {{mechanism}} of UV curing. When UV radiation reaches {{the surface of the}} untreated silver films, {{only a small part of}} the radiation penetrates into the film which may be trapped at a specific depth of the films, or get out of the film due to the reflection, or penetrate into deeper layers. The deeper the penetration depth is, the weaker UV radiation becomes. During this process, the radiation will be absorbed by the silver nanoparticles and organic substances, and then converts into heat [19, 20]. When heat gradually accumulates within the films, temperature will increase that leads to the removal of the organic substances. Moreover, the <b>curing</b> <b>depth</b> will be deeper and the removal of the organic substances will be promoted when D decreases, which means radiation becomes stronger.|$|R
40|$|We {{present in}} this paper the {{development}} of a high-resolution projection micro-stereolithography (P�SL) process by using the Digital Micromirror Device (DMD TM, Texas Instruments) as a dynamic mask. This unique technology provides a parallel fabrication of complex three-dimensional (3 D) microstructures used for micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). Based on the understanding of underlying mechanisms, a process model has been developed with all critical parameters obtained from the experimental measurement. By coupling the experimental measurement and the process model, the photon-induced curing behavior of the resin has been quantitatively studied. The role of UV doping has been thereafter justified, as it can effectively reduce the <b>curing</b> <b>depth</b> without compromising the chemical property of the resin. The fabrication of complex 3 D microstructures, such as matrix, and micro-spring array, with the smallest feature of 0. 6 �m, has been demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Microstereolithography is {{a rapidly}} {{developing}} technique for {{the generation of}} 3 D structures by the building up of 2 D layers and has shown great potential {{for the development of}} scaffolds for clinical applications. Significant research has been carried out on the development of functionalised biocompatible polymers specifically for this technique. With this technique there is potential for the fabrication of a patient/injury specific scaffold, by scanning the injured site, developing a 3 D model and converting it into 2 D layers for fabrication. The construction of 3 D scaffolds requires control of the <b>curing</b> <b>depth</b> of the resin to prevent loss of 3 D control by through polymerisation into the monomer. This control is present in commercial resins, however, a method using biocompatible materials has not been reported upon. This work demonstrates how natural products, specifically paprika extracts, can be used to control the penetration of UV light into resin, and so control the thickness of layers generated. The behaviour of these resin compositions upon exposure to light has been determined, and equations governing <b>curing</b> <b>depth</b> have been determined. The microporosity of cell growth scaffolds {{is an important factor in}} the reactivity of the material, and this is a scale which cannot be controlled in some μSL apparatus due to the lack of resolution. Microporosity has been obtained by the use of monomer soluble, nonfunctionalised polymers. This has allowed the development of scaffolds with increased surface area and so potentially higher reactivity than those without porogens. Material reactivity is also important for scaffolds, specifically in hard tissue replacement, where the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells to osteoblast cells is guided by calcium phosphates. The development of photopolymerisable resins containing hydroxyapatite in suitably stable suspensions is reported upon. These materials can be easily polymerised, and is has been shown that adult stem cells adhere to, and proliferate, on them. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} high-resolution photocross-linking of biodegradable poly(propylene fumarate) (PPF) and {{diethyl fumarate}} (DEF) using UV excimer laser photocuring at 308 nm. The <b>curing</b> <b>depth</b> can be tuned in a micrometre range {{by adjusting the}} total energy dose (total fluence). Young's moduli of the scaffolds {{are found to be}} a few gigapascal, high enough to support bone formation. The results presented here demonstrate that the proposed technique is an excellent tool for the fabrication of stiff and biocompatible structures on a micrometre scale with defined patterns of high resolution in all three spatial dimensions. Using UV laser photocuring at 308 nm will significantly improve the speed of rapid prototyping of biocompatible and biodegradable polymer scaffolds and enables its production in a few seconds, providing high lateral and horizontal resolution. This short timescale is indeed a tremendous asset that will enable a more efficient translation of technology to clinical applications. Preliminary cell tests proved that PPF : DEF scaffolds produced by excimer laser photocuring are biocompatible and, therefore, are promising candidates to be applied in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine...|$|R

Two light-cure and one tri-cure RMGI materials were selected and used according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Samples were prepared by filling the mixed materials into custom-made molds and then light-irradiating using a dental curing light. The degree of conversion and the extent of acid-base reaction of the materials at different depths (0, 1, 2, and 4 [*]mm) and postirradiation times (10 [*]min, 1 day, and 7 days) were determined using SR-FTIR spectroscopy in conjunction with the Kramers-Kronig (K-K) transformation. The setting reaction was also investigated using microhardness measurements. The results showed that the <b>depth</b> of <b>cure</b> increased over time by the continuous acid-base reaction rather than photopolymerization or chemical polymerization. Microhardness tests seemed less suitable for studying the setting reaction as a function of postirradiation time, probably due to softening from the humidity.

The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare the {{efficacy}} of quartz tungsten halogen (QTH) and light emitting diode (LED) curing lights on polymerization of resin composite. &# 13; Materials and Methods. A hybrid resin composite was used to prepare samples which were cured using two QTH and ten LED light curing sources. Twelve groups, each containing ten samples, were prepared using each light source.

40|$|Globally, several {{shortcomings}} of dental resin based composites (RBCs) remain. This {{may be related}} to problems associated with incomplete conversion (40 - 70 %), polymerisation shrinkage (1 - 4 % by volume) and the stress generated at the tooth/restoration interface. Additionally, the increased number of technique sensitive incremental steps required to fill relatively large cavities is due to inefficient light transmission at depths greater than 2 mm. The current investigation demonstrates the applicability of the exposure reciprocity law in photoactive dental materials in order to try and improve these shortcomings. The development techniques that will allow dynamic monitoring of optical and physical change will aid material development with the goal of improving <b>cure</b> <b>depths.</b> The current investigation has demonstrated the use of several analytical techniques (FT-IR spectroscopy, UV-Vis Spectroscopy and low coherence interferometry) and shown the complexity of optical phenomena within RBCs, which are affected by material composition as well as cavity dimensions. Whilst research continues to develop a novel RBC with reduced shrinkage and improved <b>depths</b> of <b>cure,</b> there is currently no commercially available solution to such problems.
