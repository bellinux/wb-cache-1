50|$|An ore-bulk-oil carrier, {{also known}} as {{combination}} carrier or OBO, is a ship designed {{to be capable of}} <b>carrying</b> <b>wet</b> or dry cargoes. The idea is {{to reduce the number of}} empty (ballast) voyages, in which large ships only carry a cargo one way and return empty for another. These are a feature of the larger bulk trades (e.g. crude oil from the Middle East, iron ore and coal from Australia, South Africa and Brazil).|$|R
5|$|An ore-bulk-oil carrier, {{also known}} as {{combination}} carrier or OBO, is a ship designed {{to be capable of}} <b>carrying</b> <b>wet</b> or dry bulk cargoes. This design was intended to provide flexibility in two ways. Firstly, an OBO would be able to switch between the dry and wet bulk trades based on market conditions. Secondly, an OBO could carry oil on one leg of a voyage and return carrying dry bulk, reducing the number of unprofitable ballast voyages it would have to make.|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe have <b>carried</b> out <b>wetting</b> {{experiments}} on textured surfaces with high aspect ratio asperities in the Wenzel state. When inclination is imparted to the asperities, we observe a strictly unidi-rectional spreading opposite to {{the direction in}} which the asperities point. The advancing contact angle decreases markedly as inclination increases. A crude numerical analysis successfully accounts for this behaviour, highlighting the interplay between Gibbs pinning {{at the top of the}} structures and imbibition along the valleys between them. In Gibbs pinning non-linearities play a major role and we find that simple line averaging-i. e. a rule of mixture-cannot account for this evolution except for weak surface perturbations, i. e. large inclinations...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Steel-concrete {{composite}} shell roofs (Comshell roofs) {{are formed}} by pouring concrete on a thin stiffened steel base shell {{which serves as}} both the permanent formwork and the tensile steel reinforcement. The thin steel base shell, constructed by bolting together open-topped modular units consisting of a base plate with surrounding edge plates, is a steel shell with thin stiffeners in both directions. The new system retains all the benefits of thin concrete shells, but {{eliminates the need for}} temporary formwork and minimises the required falsework. A key issue in the design of such shell roofs is to ensure that the steel base shell can <b>carry</b> the <b>wet</b> concrete loading safely. This paper presents the results of a series of buckling experiments on model steel base shells under simulated wet concrete loading. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the propulsion of an isolated slug of liquid along a pipeline by an expanding gas. The particular case in mind is when a body of liquid accumulates behind a closed valve in a piping system <b>carrying</b> a <b>wet</b> or condensing gas, and that valve is suddenly opened to expose the slug of liquid to a high-pressure gas. The slug will be driven along the pipeline by an expansion wave which weakens as the slug accelerates, whilst its motion will be resisted by friction and by the compression wave ahead of it. This situation has been analysed and compared with slug velocities measured in a 50 mm pipe. Also presented in this paper are measurements of the considerable forces generated by the slug as it impinges onto an orifice plate installed in the pipe. Â© 1994...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to try various {{disaggregation}} processes in order to separate vermiculite from quartz, as this reduces its quality in different industrials applications. In order to quantify {{the quality of the}} vermiculite and to evaluate the efficiency of the disaggregation operations, thermal expansion tests and mineralogical counting were <b>carried</b> out. <b>Wet</b> and dry separation processes, using as variable the time, there were performed and the products were classified according to their grain size. The thermal expansion tests were made in muffle, a number of variables being analysed such as: grain size and expansion time, at 800 °C. These were quantified by an expansion coefficient. The conclusion drawn from analysis of the results is that the best performance is obtained by using dry separation, 30 -mesh, an expansion time of 80 seconds and a temperature of 800 o C...|$|R

40|$|AMADEUS is a {{dexterous}} subsea {{robot hand}} incorporating force and slip contact sensing, using fluid filled tentacles for fingers. Hydraulic pressure variations {{in each of}} three flexible tubes (bellows) in each finger create a bending moment, and consequent motion or increase in contact force during grasping. Such fingers have inherent passive compliance, no moving parts, and are naturally depth pressure-compensated, making them ideal for reliable use in the deep ocean. In addition to the mechanical design, development of the hand has also considered closed loop finger position and force control, coordinated finger motion for grasping, force and slip sensor development/signal processing, and reactive world modeling/planning for supervisory `blind grasping¿. Initially, the application focus is for marine science tasks, but broader roles in offshore oil and gas, salvage, and military use are foreseen.
