Schmitt met with the Russian forces at the great abbey by Melk, on the Danube, and he and the commanders concocted a plan to encircle Édouard Mortier's French force near Dürenstein.

5|$|On {{mainland}} Europe, {{the rise}} of Napoleon Bonaparte as the ruler of the new French Empire resulted in a new conflict, the War of the Third <b>Coalition</b> <b>in</b> 1805, which ended disastrously for the Austrian and Russian allied armies at the Battle of Austerlitz. The treaties that ended the war created two French client monarchies in Italy, the Kingdom of Italy and the Kingdom of Naples, and French troops were left holding substantial parts of the Eastern coastline of the Adriatic in Dalmatia. These holdings significantly increased French naval interest in the Adriatic, which was well supplied with excellent ports and shipbuilding facilities, particularly at Venice.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Ostrach, {{also called}} the Battle by Ostrach, {{occurred}} 20–23March 1799. In early March, the Army of the Danube pressed forward toward Pfullendorf and Ostrach, the former an imperial city in Upper Swabia and the latter a nearby village of 300belonging to the Imperial Abbey of Salem. Their goal was to cut the Austrian line at Switzerland, preventing the Coalition use of Switzerland as an overland route between central and southern Europe. This would ostensibly isolate the armies of the <b>Coalition</b> <b>in</b> northern Italy and Germany, and prevent them from assisting one another; furthermore, if the French held the interior passes in Switzerland, they could use the routes to move their own forces between the two theaters.|$|E

5|$|At first, Sélestat {{was a major}} {{strategic}} stronghold for the French. Located {{near the}} Rhine, it controlled the access to the Vosges mountains {{and the rest of}} France. Vauban, the foremost military architect at that time, rebuilt the town walls between 1675 and 1691. However, after the conquest of Strasbourg in 1681 Sélestat lost much of its strategic importance, as Strasbourg was better located. But it remained a garrison town, and the troops stationed there helped to improve the faltering local economy. Although Protestantism was not forbidden in Alsace, French authorities largely encouraged Catholicism and opened three new convents in Sélestat. Jews were expelled from the town in 1642. During the French Revolution the population was extremely conservative and opposed to change. The new territorial organisation confirmed the decline of the town, which did not become a prefecture and was not distinguished as a subprefecture until 1806, when it replaced Barr in that capacity. Sélestat suffered from the Napoleonic wars as it was besieged and bombed by the Bavarians in 1814 and blockaded by a German <b>coalition</b> <b>in</b> 1815.|$|E
