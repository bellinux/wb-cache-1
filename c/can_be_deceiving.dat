5|$|The pre-Socratic Greek {{philosophers}} and Indian philosophers developed {{some of the}} earliest philosophical concepts of the Universe. The earliest Greek philosophers noted that appearances <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>deceiving,</b> and sought to understand the underlying reality behind the appearances. In particular, they noted the ability of matter to change forms (e.g., ice to water to steam) and several philosophers proposed that all the physical materials in the world are different forms of a single primordial material, or arche. The first to do so was Thales, who proposed this material to be water. Thales' student, Anaximander, proposed that everything came from the limitless apeiron. Anaximenes proposed the primordial material to be air on account of its perceived attractive and repulsive qualities that cause the arche to condense or dissociate into different forms. Anaxagoras proposed the principle of Nous (Mind), while Heraclitus proposed fire (and spoke of logos). Empedocles proposed the elements to be earth, water, air and fire. His four-element model became very popular. Like Pythagoras, Plato believed that all things were composed of number, with Empedocles' elements taking the form of the Platonic solids. Democritus, and later philosophers—most notably Leucippus—proposed that the Universe is composed of indivisible atoms moving through void (vacuum), although Aristotle did not believe that to be feasible because air, like water, offers resistance to motion. Air will immediately rush in to fill a void, and moreover, without resistance, it would do so indefinitely fast.|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{signs of}} colic are usually referable to pain, {{although}} the horse may appear depressed rather than painful {{in cases of}} necrosis (tissue death) of the gastrointestinal tract, inflammation of the intestines, endotoxemia, or significant dehydration. Pain levels are often {{used to determine the}} need for surgery (See Surgical intervention). Horses are more likely to require surgery if they display severe clinical signs that can not be controlled by the administration of analgesics and sedatives, or have persistent signs that require multiple administrations of such drugs. Heart rate is often used as a measure of the animal's pain level and a heart rate >60 bpm is more likely to require surgery. However, this measure <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>deceiving</b> {{in the early stages of}} a severe colic, when the horse may still retain a relatively low rate. Additionally, pain tolerance of the individual must be taken into account, since very stoic animals with severe cases of colic may not show adequate levels of pain to suggest the need for surgery. High heart rates (>60 bpm), prolonged capillary refill time (CRT), and congested mucous membranes suggest cardiovascular compromise and the need for more intense management. Decreased or absent gut sounds often suggest the need for surgical intervention if prolonged.|$|E

Her troubled family background and otherwise placid past makes her overly ambitious and docile when presented with exciting opportunities. Though gifted both academically and athletically, her first major aspiration at Easton is to get into Billings House, which holds the allure of great social privileges and respect. She manages to get the attention of the Billings Girls, and a series of initiations to test her credibility follows. She initially dates a rebellious boy named Thomas Pearson, who disappears in the first novel and is revealed to have died in the second.

5000|$|Suzanne Rahn {{has argued}} that the {{misleading}} description of the King serves as a lesson to child readers about the danger of taking people at face value. Tuerk argues that it also serves as a lesson to the deceived Ozma and Dorothy to look beneath appearances to discover reality. Ozma later speaks of his [...] "mask of fairness and good nature". Learning to discern between appearance and reality are in fact central to this book. The Wheelers depicted earlier in the novel seem ferocious and depict themselves as villains, but they are actually harmless and kind. The Nome King appears much nicer than he actually is and is the real villain of the book. In other words, appearances <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>deceiving.</b>|$|E

But he is also emerging as a significant player in a larger spiritual project, one that transcends and includes any specific tradition… Haught calls his offering to that emerging tradition “evolutionary theology.” By whatever name, these new approaches are shaking the pillars of tradition and recontextualizing the way we understand both science and religion.” ...|$|E
5000|$|On-board radars <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>deceiving.</b> Hail shafts {{generate}} weak radar echoes and {{are significantly}} {{more dangerous than}} cloudbursts.

So a counter intuitive recommendation exists: {{it is better to}} fly toward the zone of heavy precipitation or toward the darkest area of the thunderstorm line. This recommendation contradicts the usual use of on-board radars to avoid areas of strong precipitation, which is usually the best course of action. There is no [...] "miracle" [...] solution, and the best option is to avoid these thunderstorm systems by having enough fuel on board, thus reducing the temptation to take a more dangerous route in the interest of fuel savings.|$|E
