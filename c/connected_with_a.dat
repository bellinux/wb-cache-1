Throughout its existence, it was destroyed, and then restored numerous times, yet it was not spared destruction by Soviet authorities in 1935. At the time of its height, the Mezhyhirya Monastery was considered a spiritual center of Rus royal Rurikid house and later Cossacks. Currently, the area of the former monastery is located on a fenced-in woodland territory next to Novi Petrivtsi village and is directly <b>connected</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> private residence for Ukrainian government officials.|$|E
5|$|Hughes then {{signed a}} multi-fight {{deal with the}} UFC. Hughes {{defeated}} Renzo Gracie, the 1st cousin once removed of his opponent at UFC 60, via third round TKO at , setting the record for most UFC wins with 17. Both of them seemed very comfortable fighting on their feet in the early going, with Gracie landing the cleaner and more effective punches and also landing a couple of kicks. Hughes started the second round with powerful leg kicks, but after that Gracie returned to his in-and-out punching style. Hughes got double underhooks and managed to take Gracie down briefly. In the final round Hughes <b>connected</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> right hook to Gracie's chin, then <b>connected</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> leg kick and another punch. With two minutes to go he knocked Gracie down with a leg kick. Gracie took {{all the time he}} could before Hughes helped him up and then dropped him with a second leg kick. Gracie stalled again, but when he finally stood up Hughes floored him with a punch, let him get up and then attacked again. Hughes knocked Gracie down again with a fourth punch, when referee Herb Dean ended it.|$|E

5|$|In this period, steamships on rivers {{such as the}} Ohio and Mississippi {{or large}} inland bodies of water such as the Great Lakes and the Chesapeake Bay offered a {{comfortable}} and relatively fast mode of transportation. The first steamboat to serve Baltimore was the locally built Chesapeake, constructed in 1813 to link Baltimore with Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Operated by the Union Line, the boat <b>connected</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> stagecoach for the overland portion of the journey. Two years later, the Briscoe-Partridge Line's Eagle was the first steamboat to sail the length of Chesapeake Bay.|$|E

5|$|A {{cluster is}} a group of loosely coupled {{computers}} that work together closely, so that in some respects they can be regarded as a single computer. Clusters are composed of multiple standalone machines connected by a network. While machines in a cluster {{do not have to be}} symmetric, load balancing is more difficult if they are not. The most common type of cluster is the Beowulf cluster, which is a cluster implemented on multiple identical commercial off-the-shelf computers <b>connected</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> TCP/IP Ethernet local area network. Beowulf technology was originally developed by Thomas Sterling and Donald Becker. The vast majority of the TOP500 supercomputers are clusters.|$|E

5|$|After {{upsetting}} second-ranked Michigan State, 34–7, Maryland {{climbed to}} an AP Poll ranking of {{eighth in the}} nation and then defeated Georgetown. The following game they met N.C. State at Byrd Stadium for Homecoming weekend. In the first quarter, a Maryland fumble rolled out of the end zone for a safety, and soon after, another fumble set up a touchdown rush by NC State. Maryland advanced inside the N.C. State five-yard line three times but was unable to score. In the third quarter, NC State scored again to expand their lead, 0–16. Maryland scored on a 21-yard pass from Jack Scarbath to Bob Shemonski. With three minutes remaining, Shemonski <b>connected</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pass to Pete Augsburger for another touchdown. A 47-yard drive into Wolfpack territory ended with an interception in the end zone with seconds remaining. The loss effectively ended the Terrapins' hopes for a bowl game bid. The second loss dropped them out of the AP Poll {{for the remainder of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the line}} started in 1924, with the line opening in 1940. It allowed the {{district}} of Sogn access to Bergen and Oslo via the Bergen Line. Electric traction was taken into use in 1944; at first El 9 locomotives were used, and from 1982 El 11. Until 1991, the train <b>connected</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> ferry service from Flåm to Gudvangen. In 1992, freight services were terminated, and due to low ticket prices and high operating costs, the line was nearly closed. In 1998, Flåm Utvikling took over marketing and ticket sale for the line, prices were heavily increased and El 17 locomotives were introduced. The trains remain operated by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB), while the line itself is {{owned and operated by}} the Norwegian National Rail Administration.|$|E
5|$|However, no {{progress}} was made with the airfield for over a decade. Instead, the water aerodrome at Bukta was upgraded. Initially the passengers were transported to the aircraft with a boat, {{but after a few}} years a floating dock was built. Services were only provided during five summer months, from May through September. During the rest of the year, Alta had no airline service; travel time to Oslo was then six days, largely by ship. The route was taken over by Widerøe in 1954, who bought a de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter to serve a route from Tromsø via Alta to Hammerfest, Kirkenes and Vadsø. In Tromsø, the routes <b>connected</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Norwegian Air Lines' seaplane service to Oslo. Bukta had 2,000 annual passengers in 1957, and the summer route was flown daily beginning in 1960.|$|E

This <b>connected</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Highland service at both Keith and Elgin, until the Highland re-timed {{the train and}} broke the connection at Elgin. The Great North applied to the Board of Trade for an order for two connections a day at Elgin. This was refused, but in 1886 the Great North and Highland railways came to an agreement to pool receipts from the stations between Grange and Elgin and refer any disputes to an arbiter. The midday Highland train was re-timed {{to connect with the}} Great North at Keith and Elgin, and a service connected at Elgin with an Aberdeen train that had divided en route to travel via the coast and Craigellachie.|$|E

Atias' only scored two points after being penalized for an illegal kick to the legs. Atias lost in the round of 16 against Venilton Teixeira from Brazil by point gap of 2–16. Atias would have had a chance to compete for the bronze medal if Teixeira reached the finals, however he failed to do so and therefore Atias was eliminated from competition.|$|E

The fight {{was the first major}} bout in St. Louis in more than 40years, and it was a sellout. Judah was the aggressor {{throughout}} the fight. He knocked Spinks down to his knees at the bell in the seventh round, but it was not ruled a knockdown. Spinks had a strong start to the ninth round and <b>connected</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> left hand, then followed with a right hand and a combination, but Judah scored a knockdown moments later. Judah pressed the attack after the first knockdown and avoided Spinks' desperate efforts to tie him up. After Spinks was knocked down for the second time, the referee stopped the fight, and Judah became the new Undisputed Welterweight Champion.|$|E
5|$|Spiders are {{depicted}} in Indigenous Australian art, in rock and bark paintings, and for clan totems.

Their totem design is <b>connected</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> major regional ceremony, providing a connection with neighboring clans also having spider totems in their rituals. Nareau, the Lord Spider, created the universe, according to the traditional Cosmology of Oceania's Kiribati islanders of the Tungaru archipelago (Gilbert Islands); similarly, Areop-Enap ("Old Spider") plays an important part in the creation myth of the traditional Nauru islanders of Micronesia. In the Philippines, there is a Visayan folk tale version of The Spider and the Fly which explains why the spider hates the fly.|$|E
5|$|The {{basement}} {{contains the}} gunner's mess, canteen, No. 1 ancillary store, pantry and officer's kitchen. The canteen sold everyday necessities {{as well as}} a few items like biscuits, sweets and tobacco to the stationed troops. Profits from the canteen were used to fund sporting equipment for the garrison. The No.1 ancillary store was used for various pieces of delicate equipment, fuses, friction tubes and rockets. In 1887 an explosion in the room caused a number of injuries, damage to the store and to the above officer's quarters. The barracks room and officer's quarters are <b>connected</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> door, probably added in the 1930s as it {{is not part of the}} original plans. The barracks room accommodated approximately 20 men. For display purposes it is outfitted as for similar period barracks.|$|E

5|$|The {{motivation}} for the Triangle Link was the desire to have a fixed link between the islands of Stord and Bømlo. The first documented proposals {{were made in the}} 1960s and involved building a pontoon bridge across Stokksundet, inspired by the plans to build what would become the Nordhordland Bridge north of Bergen. In 1973, the municipal councils of Bømlo, Stord and Fitjar decided to launch a planning process, which concluded that a pontoon bridge between Sørstokken and Foldrøyholmen would be optimal. The report also considered bridges across the Fitjar Archipelago and a crossing via Spissøy and Føyno. There were protests from the shipping industry, who wished to continue to use the strait for ship traffic. The islands were <b>connected</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> network of five ferry services: Skjersholmane–Valevåg connected Stord and Sveio, Skjersholmane–Utbjoa connected Stord and Vindafjord, Sagvåg–Siggjarvåg connected Stord and Bølmo, and Bømlo was connected to the mainland both by the Mosterhamn–Valevåg Ferry and the Langevåg–Buavåg Ferry.|$|E
