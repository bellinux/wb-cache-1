2500|$|In {{the event}} of a combat or {{emergency}} situation, the mixture control may be moved to the auto rich position, providing extra fuel to the engine, or in military aircraft, into military position, if the aircraft is so equipped. [...] When in the military position, the Anti-Detonation Injection (ADI) system is activated, injecting the ADI fluid into the engine intake system. [...] The pressure in the ADI system moves the derichment diaphragm in the fuel control to close off the derichment jet, reducing the fuel flow to a leaner mixture which produces higher engine power by raising the mean effective pressure. This causes the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>temperature</b> to increase to a very high level, which dramatically increases the risk of detonation (see: engine knocking). Adding the ADI fluid raises the mean octane level of the charge preventing pre-ignition and also lowers the cylinder temperatures to a more acceptable level. As this operation takes the engine well beyond its normal design limits, this power setting is not suitable for prolonged use. Once the ADI fluid is exhausted or if the mixture control valve is moved out of the military position, the fuel control derichment diaphragm pressure is lost, and the derichment jet is opened once again for normal fuel flow.|$|E

40|$|Best economy (lean of peak or LOP) {{operation}} of aircraft engines rather than best power (rich of peak or ROP) has been suggested {{as a means to}} reduce fuel consumption in light aircraft with modest speed reduction leading to reduced operating cost (increased miles per gallon), and to reduce <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>temperatures</b> (CHTs) leading to improved engine longevity and reduced maintenance cost. A recent study by Chrisman (2011) using a limited number of data sets from aircraft in the Purdue University fleet of Cirrus SR 20 training aircraft demonstrated statistically significant reduced fuel consumption and reduced CHT but no statistically definite speed reduction. This study confirms the earlier results for fuel consumption and CHTs using expanded data sets.

Equally, it has been pointed out the rate <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>temperatures</b> drop off after a normal engine shutdown is often much faster than the usual rates deemed to present a shock cooling risk. Furthermore, others believe damage usually associated with shock cooling is actually caused by rapid throttle changes where fuel, which has been supercooled during high-altitude flight, is introduced into a very hot engine cylinder during descent, where rich of peak (as opposed to lean of peak) operation is considered the norm, thus causing higher operating temperatures.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{performance testing}} of 3 W Modellmotoren's 100 i-B 2 {{which is a}} two-stroke gasoline engine presently being used to power a commercially produced Unmanned Air Vehicle (NAVMAR's Mako). Since the engine was originally manufactured for use in radio controlled model aircraft, the only performance {{information provided by the}} manufacturer is its rated power output of 9. 3 Hp at 8500 RPM. However, much more detailed information is required for the UAV application in order to select propellers and engine operating points that maximize the range, endurance, and load-carrying capacity. This thesis reports the first detailed characterization of this engine's performance in the open literature that includes measurements of power output, specific fuel consumption, exhaust and <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>temperatures,</b> and exhaust gas composition as a function of engine speed. The measurements show that the peak power output is 9. 32 Hp at 8500 RPM with a brake specific fuel consumption of 0. 797 lb/Hp-hr. The maximum BSFC of 0. 668 lb/Hp-hr is achieved during ¼ throttle operation at 6500 RPM with a power output level of 5. 08 Hp. Exhaust gas composition measurements indicate that the carburetor controls mixture ratio effectively across the entire operating range of the engine unlike smaller model engines. A preliminary attempt was also made to simulate the engine numerically in order to identify areas where the engine design could be improved. The simulation suggests that while the engine's performance is near optimal, {{it might be possible to}} gain additional power by decreasing the exhaust port duration...|$|R
40|$|Given {{here are}} the results of tests made to {{determine}} the effect of fuel consumption on the cylinder temperatures and the performance of a cowled Wright J- 5 engine. The results of these tests indicate that enriching the mixture by increasing the carburetor size results in a reduction in <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> and barrel <b>temperatures.</b> The cylinders shielded by the magnetos or the points on the cylinder that do not receive a free flow of cooling air increase most rapidly in temperature as the mixture is leaned. A free flow of air past the cylinders is essential for satisfactory operation on a lean mixture. The results of these tests show that the Wright J- 5 engine can withstand severe temperatures for short periods of operation. The test results also show to what extent destructive temperatures may be avoided by enriching the mixture...|$|R
50|$|Improper, {{incorrect}} {{and poorly}} executed engine modifications {{can have a}} detrimental effect on performance. Mechanical and electrical components will suffer or simply fail as a result. An example would be {{the use of an}} air compressor such as a turbocharger to increase the volume of air used in power stroke of the otto cycle. In a typical chemical reaction, the air-fuel ratio must be a minimum of 14:1 (see Stoichiometry). If higher ratios are used, higher pressures and temperatures are observed in the cylinders, which can quickly push an engine beyond its intended design limits. Neglecting such operating parameters can lead to premature failure, such as warped <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads</b> and walls (<b>temperature</b> related), disintegrated piston rings, cracked or bent connecting rods and crankshafts (excessive amount of torque applied), total cooling system failure, engine fire, engine detonation, engine seizing, and even blowouts. This can all lead to very expensive repairs, as well as being very dangerous.|$|R
50|$|In {{the event}} of a combat or {{emergency}} situation, the mixture control may be moved to the auto rich position, providing extra fuel to the engine, or in military aircraft, into military position, if the aircraft is so equipped. When in the military position, the Anti-Detonation Injection (ADI) system is activated, injecting the ADI fluid into the engine intake system. The pressure in the ADI system moves the derichment diaphragm in the fuel control to close off the derichment jet, reducing the fuel flow to a leaner mixture which produces higher engine power by raising the mean effective pressure. This causes the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>temperature</b> to increase to a very high level, which dramatically increases the risk of detonation (see: engine knocking). Adding the ADI fluid raises the mean octane level of the charge preventing pre-ignition and also lowers the cylinder temperatures to a more acceptable level. As this operation takes the engine well beyond its normal design limits, this power setting is not suitable for prolonged use. Once the ADI fluid is exhausted or if the mixture control valve is moved out of the military position, the fuel control derichment diaphragm pressure is lost, and the derichment jet is opened once again for normal fuel flow.|$|E
50|$|Mixtures {{that are}} richer than {{stoichiometric}} allow for greater peak engine power when using vaporized liquid fuel {{due to the}} mixture {{not being able to}} reach a perfectly homogenized state so extra fuel is added to ensure all oxygen is burned producing maximum power. The ideal mixture in this type of operation depends on the individual engine. For example, engines with forced induction such as turbochargers and superchargers typically require a richer mixture under wide open throttle than naturally aspirated engines. Forced induction engines can be catastrophically damaged by burning too lean for too long. The leaner the air-fuel mixture, the higher the combustion temperature is inside the cylinder. Too high a temperature will destroy an engine - melting the pistons and valves. This can happen if one ports the head and/or manifolds or increase boost without compensating by installing larger or more injectors, and/or increasing the fuel pressure to a sufficient level. Conversely, engine performance can be lessened by increasing fueling without increasing air flow into the engine.Furthermore, if an engine is leaned to the point where its exhaust gas temperature starts to fall, its <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>temperature</b> will also fall. This is only recommended in the cruising configuration, never when accelerating hard, but is becoming increasingly popular in aviation circles, where the appropriate engine monitoring gauges are fitted and the fuel air mixture can be manually adjusted.|$|E
