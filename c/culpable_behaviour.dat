40|$|The {{criminal}} law on serious traffic offences {{is a fascinating}} area. The traffic context presents legislators with numerous controversial issues. One such issue is when severe consequences are matched with low moral culpability. How should the law deal with a driver who kills someone because she failed to see the person when looking (momentary inattention) ? Another controversial issue concerns highly <b>culpable</b> <b>behaviour</b> that remains without serious consequences. How should the law cope with a driver who nearly kills someone when overtaking recklessly? Courts dealing with serious traffic offences face equally difficult questions. The traffic context generates many hard cases that call the outermost boundaries of general doctrinal concepts like intent, negligence or causation into question. This book contains an international collection of essays on criminal liability for serious traffic offences. The essays on the Netherlands, England and Wales, France, Germany and Spain reveal that there are enormous differences in both drafting and interpretation of serious traffic offences. The other essays elaborate respectively {{on the role of}} culpability and harm in sentencing, traffic-psychological insights relevant to accident causation and the concept of conditional intent in relation to extremely dangerous traffic behaviour. This book aims to generate valuable insights for legal scholars, legislators and practitioners all over the world.   Table of contents 1. The Complex Nature of Serious Traffic Offences 2.

40|$|In England and Wales {{the age of}} {{criminal}} responsibility is set at 10 years. The current law therefore assumes all children are sufficiently mature at this age to accept criminal responsibility for their behaviour. However the English criminal justice system takes no account {{of the evidence that}} children and young people differ in developmental immaturity from adults and thus may be less culpable than adults for their choices and behaviour. Children and young people are less mature than adults in terms of the judgment factors of responsibility, perspective and sensation seeking and thus experience difficulties in weighing and comparing consequences when making decisions and contemplating the meaning of long-range consequences that will be realized 5 - 10 years in the future. These cognitive difficulties also have implications for young peoples’ ability to be competent defendants in an adversarial atmosphere. In 2006 the Law Commission for England and Wales recommended that ‘developmental immaturity’ be incorporated into the defence of diminished responsibility. The Law Commission recommended that it should be possible for the courts to consider whether the young person’s developmental immaturity and cognitive limitations impairs their ability to stand trial for murder. This recommendation {{was not included in the}} Coroners and Justice Act 2009. This paper will argue that the criminal justice system needs to recognise that children may not yet be developed enough to understand the wrongfulness of what they do. Anglo-American criminal jurisprudence on desert and moral fault, neuroscience data which has examined the brain developments and cognitive functioning of adolescents, and US and UK public opinion surveys will be considered as the paper will argue that the low age {{of criminal}} responsibility runs the risk of children being held criminally <b>culpable</b> for <b>behaviour</b> they are too immature to fully understand. This paper will consider the question of when is it fair to subject young people to the full rigours of the criminal justice system...|$|R
2500|$|Depending {{on how a}} court construes negotiations, a {{representation}} could become a term of the contract, {{as well as one}} giving rise to the right to rescind. A misrepresentation that is a term, will entitle the misrepresentee to a simple breach of contract claim, with [...] "expectation damages" [...] for loss of potential profits (subject to remoteness and the duty to mitigate). If the misrepresentation is not a term, then damages may also be available, but only [...] "reliance damages" [...] for losses that have been incurred. Until 1963, the general rule was that only for fraud (i.e. an intentional or reckless misrepresentation) were damages available. For fraud, damages are available for all losses that flow directly from the misrepresentation. However, in its Tenth Report the Law Reform Committee recommended that damages should also be available for negligent misrepresentations. This led to the drafting of the Misrepresentation Act 1967, and just before the Act was passed, the House of Lords also decided in Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd there should be a new claim for negligent misrepresentation at common law. While Hedley Byrne remains an important case for an independent action in tort, MA 1967 section 2(1) was instantly more generous than the common law. It allows damages if the claimant shows a defendant has made a false representation, and then the defendant cannot prove that they had reasonable grounds for making a statement and honestly believed it was true. So while the common law would put the burden of proof on a claimant to show a defendant made a negligent misstatement, MA 1967 s 2(1) shifts the burden of proof to the defendant. The measure of damages is also more generous under the Act than at common law, because just as the Law Reform Report was drafted, the House of Lords was introducing a limit on the quantum of damages for negligence to losses that are reasonably foreseeable. MA 1967 section 2(1), however, was drafted by reference to state the same damages were available as for fraud. So in Royscot Trust Ltd v Rogerson, the Court of Appeal held that even where {{a representation}} is negligent, and not fraud, the same quantum of damages is available as for fraud. This is controversial among academics who argue that fraud is more morally <b>culpable</b> than negligent <b>behaviour,</b> and should therefore deserve a more severe limit on compensation, though it is not entirely resolved what the proper circumstances for remoteness ought to be. Under section 2(2) the court has the discretion to substitute the right to rescind a contract for a small misrepresentation with an award of damages. Under section 3, a court has the power to strike down clauses excluding remedies for misrepresentation if they fail the reasonableness test in the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977.|$|R
40|$|This {{book will}} {{consider}} the question of when {{is it fair to}} hold young people criminally responsible and to subject young people to the rigours of the criminal youth justice system. The book will examine whether young people should be treated as responsible moral and legal agents and will argue that the current English youth justice system has developed in a way that runs the risk of children and young people being prosecuted for crimes they are too immature to fully understand. The law, as a system of rules that guides and governs human interaction, is premised on the view that humans can understand and follow rules. The law’s concept of a person is a practical, reasoning, rule-following being who understands {{the difference between right and}} wrong. Therefore when a criminal court convicts the defendant of an offence, it is because he is responsible for his conduct. Effective criminal law requires that citizens understand that certain conduct is prohibited, the nature of their conduct and the consequences for doing what the law prohibits (Morse, 1997). Thus criminal liability “should be imposed only on persons who are sufficiently aware of what they are doing, and of the consequences it may have, that they can fairly be said to have chosen the behaviour and its consequences” (Ashworth, 2003 : 158). Hart (1968) similarly emphasises the principle that punishment should be restricted to those who have voluntarily broken the law and stresses that criminal liability is founded upon “… the simple idea that unless a man has the capacity and a fair opportunity or chance to adjust his behaviour to the law its penalties ought not to be applied to him”. There is thus an expectation that for an individual to be convicted of a crime he must be a moral agent, as conviction represents a moral criticism (Arenella, 1992; Strawson, 1974; Kadish, 1987). Judgements about whether particular conduct is blameworthy must operate within the framework of substantive moral values. Adults are presumed to be mature and to have developed their decision-making capacities and thus are held accountable for their behaviour. Under the normal rules of criminal law, an adult’s transgression is deemed less blameworthy than typical offenders if their decision-making capacities are impaired, for example by mental illness which is attributable to a condition falling within the M’Nagthen rules (Simester at el, 2010 : 796). Currently in England and Wales the defence of infancy excuses all children below 10 years of age from criminal liability as such children are considered morally irresponsible and lacking blameworthiness. The current law thus assumes all children are sufficiently mature at 10 years of age to accept criminal responsibility for their behaviour. Although children between 10 and 18 years may understand the difference between right and wrong from a young age, they do not yet possess the emotional maturity to control their impulsivity and appreciate the consequences of their actions. Children and young people are less mature than adults in terms of the judgment factors of responsibility, perspective and sensation-seeking and thus experience difficulties in weighing and comparing consequences when making decisions and contemplating the meaning of long-range consequences that will be realized 5 - 10 years in the future (Modecki, 2008, Woolard, 2002). These cognitive difficulties also have implications for young peoples’ ability to be competent defendants in adversarial atmospheres (Woolard, 2002). Legal theorists have not systematically applied themselves to questions such as, if young people lack the capacity to make a meaningful choice and to control their impulses, should they be held criminally <b>culpable</b> for their <b>behaviour?</b> In what ways is the immaturity of young offenders relevant to their blameworthiness? Should youth offending behaviour be proscribed by criminal law? The book seeks to address these questions by exploring international and historical evidence on how societies regulate criminal behaviour by young people and undertaking a careful examination of the developmental capacities and processes that are relevant to young people’s criminal choices. The book will examine the following questions: •	Why do we attribute criminal responsibility to children and young people? •	What is the function of the criminal law/criminal justice system and how does it apply to young people? •	Are young people fully responsible moral and legal agents? •	In what way is immaturity relevant to blameworthiness? I will critically analyse the implications of these questions for policy-making in England and Wales and conclude by proposing changes to the present law. Young children are certainly moral objects, in that the stance we take towards them is moral, hence, they do need an exemption from liability (Horder, 1996). Their culpability depends crucially on their powers of moral reasoning and judgement, and of self-control. How far are young people capable of grasping the wrongfulness of their conduct in question, and of controlling their own conduct in the light of their moral understanding (Zimring, 2000) ? In England and Wales children and young people defined in law as criminally responsible have historically, and presently, been addressed by the criminal justice system and the criminal law in ways which are largely similar to how adults are treated. Yet the expansion of the concept of childhood in our culture, such that the child has been defined as a person under 18 years of age in the Children Act 1989 and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the extension of young people’s transition to adulthood requires fundamental changes in the way the criminal law addresses young people. A more synthesised and integrated approach is needed to the way in which under 18 s are dealt with by the police, the courts and the youth justice system, an approach which is clearly distinct from that for dealing with adults. My argument throughout this book is that the youth justice response needs to be reconceptualised in a context where one of the central objectives of institutions regulating children and young people’s behaviour is to support the interests and welfare of those children, unlike traditional criminal law which focusses upon providing redress, and retribution, against harm to others via punishment. Braithwaite and Pettit (1990 : 45) talk of the need to posit a ‘satiable’ goal for criminal law, which motivates ‘respect for uncontroversial limits’ on the law’s powers, and does ‘not make voracious demands’ that threaten those limits. Zimring (1998 : 479) suggests that the law should make substantial efforts to punish youth violence without eliminating an offender's chances to grow into adulthood in near-normal circumstances. If institutions addressing children and young people had a different conception of the implication of responsibility for children, from the implications of responsibility for adults, and were oriented towards the welfare of all children including victims and offenders, these objectives could be realised and could encourage changes in the cultural perceptions of young people who break the law. This book aims to provide a systematic analysis of how we think about young people who offend and the criminal laws used to respond to them. To answer this question we need a positive account of the aims and functions of the youth justice system...|$|R
