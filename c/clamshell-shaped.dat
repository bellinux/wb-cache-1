500|$|Toyota {{claims that}} the Aurion is {{designed}} to Australian tastes, {{although it has been}} designed with markets such as Asia in mind. Hogios states that the Aurion follows the traits of current Australian styling, with a tendency to look towards European designs for inspiration. In addition, like its other vehicles of similar vintage, Toyota designed the Aurion within the realm of its [...] "vibrant clarity" [...] design language. According to chief designer Hogios, the car makes particular use of the [...] "vibrant clarity" [...] theory known as [...] "perfect imbalance". This involves body features that act as a counterpoint to other body features. Examples of this include intersecting concave and convex surfaces and vertical sculpted features on the front fascia, which are balanced by the horizontal headlamps. The front-end's [...] "double concave architecture" [...] can also be characterised by its protruding bonnet crease line and deep grille. The same architecture is applied at the rear, with a deep bumper, a <b>clamshell-shaped</b> boot lid that envelops over the flanks, dual exhaust pipes and tail lamps.

50|$|Slurry {{walls are}} {{typically}} constructed by {{starting with a}} set of guide walls, typically 1 m deep and 0.5 m thick. The guide walls are constructed on the ground surface to outline the desired slurry trench and guide the excavation machinery. Excavation is done using a special <b>clamshell-shaped</b> digger or a hydromill trench cutter, suspended from a crane. The excavator digs down to design depth (or bedrock) for the first wall segment. The excavator is then lifted and moved along the trench guide walls to continue the trench with successive cuts as needed. The trench is at all times kept filled with slurry to prevent its collapse, but the liquid filling allows the excavation machinery and excavation spoil to be moved without hindrance.|$|E
5000|$|The cap may be {{somewhat}} viscid when wet. Dimensions of the cap are approximately 0.5-2.0 cm across. The fruit body is generally small, brown, and <b>clamshell-shaped.</b> Tectella patellaris lacks a true stem. The stipitate point of attachment is short (0.1-0.3 cm) and manifests as a lateral extension of the pileus. The gills radiate from this central point of attachment. This mushroom is saprobic and found on fallen logs of hardwoods in North America and Europe. The specific epithet patellaris means [...] "dish shaped". The mushroom {{is commonly known as}} the [...] "Veiled Panus". The snuff brown gills of young specimens are covered with a buff white ephemeral partial veil that may be absent in older specimens. The spore deposit from Tectella patellaris is white.|$|E
50|$|The OCO launch {{failed because}} the Taurus-XL {{launcher}} payload fairing failed to separate. A payload fairing is a <b>clamshell-shaped</b> cover that encloses and protects a payload {{on the pad}} and during early flight. Fairings are a standard component of expendable launch vehicles, and they are always jettisoned {{as soon as possible}} after a rocket has climbed high enough for heating from air friction to no longer risk damaging the payload. On this flight, the fairing should have been jettisoned several seconds after Stage 2 ignition. The extra mass of the fairing was not a significant factor during the flight of the larger lower stages, but it kept the relatively small Stage 3 from adding enough velocity to reach orbit, so the resulting sub-orbital ballistic path took the payload into the ocean near Antarctica, 17 minutes after liftoff.|$|E

40|$|SummaryTransposons are {{ubiquitous}} genetic {{elements that}} drive genome rearrangements, evolution, {{and the spread}} of infectious disease and drug-resistance. Many transposons, such as Mu, Tn 7, and IS 21, require regulatory AAA+ ATPases for function. We use X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy to show that the ATPase subunit of IS 21, IstB, assembles into a <b>clamshell-shaped</b> decamer that sandwiches DNA between two helical pentamers of ATP-associated AAA+ domains, sharply bending the duplex into a 180 ° U-turn. Biochemical studies corroborate key features of the structure and further show that the IS 21 transposase, IstA, recognizes the IstB•DNA complex and promotes its disassembly by stimulating ATP hydrolysis. Collectively, these studies reveal a distinct manner of higher-order assembly and client engagement by a AAA+ ATPase and suggest a mechanistic model where IstB binding and subsequent DNA bending primes a selected insertion site for efficient transposition...|$|E
40|$|This work {{explores the}} {{electronic}} structures and reactivity patterns of diplatinum(II, II) and dipalladium(II, II) complexes. Complexes containing metal-metal bonds play {{important roles in}} both inorganic and organometallic chemistry. Among the many examples of these complexes, dimers of square planar Rh I, Ir I, and Pt II centers comprise a special class that feature attractive d 8 –d 8 interactions. The unique electronic structure characteristic of these complexes gives rise to chemical, photochemical, and photophysical properties that have engaged researchers for the past 35 years. One of the best-known examples of these compounds is tetrakis(µ-pyrophosphito) platinum(II), Pt(pop). Herein, the photophysical properties of Pt(pop) are compared with its fluoroborated analogue, Pt(pop-BF 2). This complex possesses eight BF 2 groups that replace the hydrogen atoms located between each “pop” ligand. When compared with Pt(pop), Pt(pop-BF 2) has a much greater singlet lifetime (1. 56 ns) and singlet quantum yield (0. 27). The enhancement {{is the result of}} a drastically slower 1 A 2 u → 3 A 2 u intersystem crossing rate. In particular, the thermal barrier to intersystem crossing is significantly higher in Pt(pop-BF 2) (2230 cm - 1 vs. 1190 cm - 1). We believe this is primarily the result of the increased rigidity of the complex afforded by the BF 2 groups. The rigidity increases the energy of symmetry-lowering vibrational modes, which are necessary to promote spin-orbit mixing of the 1 dσ*pσ and 3 dσ*pσ states. Despite the many examples of M-M bonded d 8 –d 8 complexes of Rh I, Ir I, and Pt II in the literature, until recently there were no Pd II complexes fitting this description. Our investigations of <b>clamshell-shaped</b> Pd II dimers [(2 -phenylpyridine) Pd(µ-X) ] 2 and [(2 -p-tolylpyridine) Pd(µ-X) ] 2 (X = OAc or TFA) revealed short Pd–Pd distances (2. 85 Å). The molecules adopt this unusual geometry in part because of a d 8 –d 8 bonding interaction between the two Pd centers. Density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio (AI) analyses confirm the presence of a Pd–Pd bonding interaction in [(2 -phenylpyridine) Pd(µ-X) ] 2 and show that the HOMO is a d z 2 σ*Pd–Pd antibonding orbital, while the LUMO and proximal unoccupied orbitals are mainly located on the 2 -phenylpyridine rings. Computational analyses of other Pd II –Pd II dimers that have short Pd–Pd distances yield an orbital ordering similar to that of [(2 -phenylpyridine) Pd(µ-X) ] 2, but quite different from that found for d 8 –d 8 dimers of Rh, Ir, and Pt. This difference in orbital ordering arises because of the unusually large energy gap between the 4 d and 5 p orbitals in Pd, and may explain why Pd d 8 –d 8 dimers do not exhibit the distinctive photophysical properties of related Rh, Ir, and Pt species. Our work on Pd II –Pd II electronic structures led us to employ these complexes as electrocatalysts in the regioselective chlorination of C–H bonds. Previous work on d 8 –d 8 complexes has established that when treated with halogens (Cl 2, Br 2, or I 2), the complex undergoes two-center oxidative addition to form an axially coordinated X–d 7 –d 7 –X species. Similar products are observed following electrochemical oxidation in the presence of a halide (Cl –, Br –, or I –). Recently, related Pd II –Pd II complexes were found to selectively chlorinate benzo[h]quinoline through reductive elimination from a Cl–Pd III –Pd III –Cl species. This led us to probe the viability of the analogous electrochemical route. Cyclic voltammetry, spectroelectrochemistry, and bulk electrolysis measurements confirm that electrochemical oxidation of Pd II –Pd II yields the identical Cl–Pd III –Pd III –Cl intermediate, which is capable of reductive chlorination of C–H bonds. Additional evidence for formation of axially coordinated bromide and acetate species is also presented. Over 10 turnovers of 10 -chlorobenzo[h]quinoline were achieved at 80...|$|E
