5|$|Some teleosts are migratory; certain {{freshwater}} species move within river {{systems on}} an annual basis; other species are anadromous, spending their lives at sea and moving inland to spawn, salmon and striped bass being examples. Others, exemplified by the eel, are <b>catadromous,</b> doing the reverse. The fresh water European eel migrates across the Atlantic Ocean as an adult to breed in floating seaweed in the Sargasso Sea. The adults spawn here and then die, but the developing young are swept by the Gulf Stream towards Europe. By the time they arrive, they are small fish and enter estuaries and ascend rivers, overcoming obstacles in their path to reach the streams and ponds where they spend their adult lives.|$|E
25|$|According to the NYSDEC Hudson River Estuary Program, about 220 {{species of}} fish, {{including}} 173 native species, currently {{are found in}} the Hudson River. These include striped bass, the most important game fish in the Hudson. Estimates of the striped bass population in the Hudson range to nearly 100 million fish. American eels also live in the river before reaching breeding age; for much of this stage they are known as glass eels because of the transparency of their bodies. The fish are the only <b>catadromous</b> species in the Hudson's estuary.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s, beavers {{were brought}} to Tierra Del Fuego in {{southern}} Chile and Argentina for commercial fur production and introduced near Fagnano Lake. Although the fur enterprise failed, 25 mating pairs of beavers were released into the wild. Having no natural predators in their new environment, they quickly spread throughout the main island, and to other islands in the archipelago, reaching a number of 100,000 individuals within just 50 years. Although they have been considered an invasive species, {{it has been more}} recently shown that the beaver have some beneficial ecological effects on native fish and should not be considered wholly detrimental. Although the dominant Lenga beech (Nothofagus pumilio) forest can regenerate from stumps, most of the newly created beaver wetlands are being colonized by the rarer native Antarctic beech (Nothofagus antarctica). It is not known whether the shrubbier Antarctic beech will be succeeded by the originally dominant and larger Lengo beech, however, and the beaver wetlands are readily colonized by non-native plant species. In contrast, areas with introduced beaver were associated with increased populations of the native <b>catadromous</b> puye fish (Galaxias maculatus). Furthermore, the beavers did not seem to have a highly beneficial impact on the exotic brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) which have negative impacts on native stream fishes in the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve, Chile. They have also been found to cross saltwater to islands northward; and reached the Chilean mainland in the 1990s. On balance, because of their landscape-wide modifications to the Fuegian environment and because biologists want to preserve the unique biota of the region, most favor their removal.|$|E

2500|$|Lotic systems {{typically}} {{connect to}} each other, forming {{a path to}} the ocean (spring → stream → river → ocean), and many fishes have life cycles that require stages in both fresh and salt water. [...] Salmon, for example, are anadromous species that are born in freshwater but {{spend most of their}} adult life in the ocean, returning to fresh water only to spawn.

2500|$|The Yangtze basin {{contains}} {{a large number}} of freshwater crab species, including several endemics. A particularly rich genus in the river basin is the potamid Sinopotamon.

It is a commercially important species in its native range where it is farmed, but the Chinese mitten crab has also been spread to Europe and North America where considered invasive.|$|E
2500|$|Dams {{alter the}} flow, temperature, and {{sediment}} regime of lotic systems. [...] Additionally, many rivers are dammed at multiple locations, amplifying the impact. [...] Dams can cause enhanced clarity and reduced variability in stream flow, {{which in turn}} cause an increase in periphyton abundance. [...] Invertebrates immediately below a dam can show reductions in species richness due to an overall reduction in habitat heterogeneity. [...] Also, thermal changes can affect insect development, with abnormally warm winter temperatures obscuring cues to break egg diapause and overly cool summer temperatures leaving too few acceptable days to complete growth. [...] Finally, dams fragment river systems, isolating previously continuous populations, and preventing the migrations of anadromous and <b>catadromous</b> species.|$|E
2500|$|River {{estuaries}} form important staging {{points during}} {{the migration of}} anadromous and catadromus fish species, such as salmon and eels, giving them time to form social groups and {{to adjust to the}} changes in salinity. Salmon are anadromous, meaning they live in the sea but ascend rivers to spawn; eels are <b>catadromous,</b> living in rivers and streams, but returning to the sea to breed. Besides the species that migrate through estuaries, there are many other fish that use them as [...] "nursery grounds" [...] for spawning or as places young fish can feed and grow before moving elsewhere.

50|$|Pseudaphritis urvillii is {{the only}} species of fish in the family Pseudaphritidae and the genus Pseudaphritis. It is known also as the <b>catadromous</b> icefish, the tupong or even more {{commonly}} as the congolli.|$|E
50|$|The Rahway River {{is home to}} four {{anadromous}} {{fish species}} (fish that spawn in freshwater and live in saltwater) and one species of <b>catadromous</b> fish species (fish that spawn in salt water and live in freshwater).|$|E
50|$|The most {{remarkable}} <b>catadromous</b> fishes are freshwater eels of genus Anguilla, whose larvae drift from spawning grounds in the Sargasso sea, sometimes {{for months or}} years, before entering freshwater river and streams as glass eels or elvers (see eel life history).|$|E
50|$|Like {{other members}} of the Anguillidae, longfin eels have a rather unusual life cycle: they grow and mature into fertile adults in fresh water, then migrate to the sea to breed. This <b>catadromous</b> {{breeding}} system also ensures randomised mating, creating a panmictic population.|$|E
50|$|Percalates is a {{recently}} resurrected genus containing the medium-sized, predatory, <b>catadromous</b> fish Australian bass (Percalates novemaculeata) and estuary perch (Percalates colonorum), which are endemic to coastal rivers and estuaries of south-eastern Australia. They {{have traditionally been}} included in Macquaria instead. They are highly valued recreational fishing species.|$|E
5000|$|This type of {{ecological}} succession from a freshwater to marine ecosystem {{is typical of}} river estuaries. River estuaries form important staging points during the migration of anadromous and <b>catadromous</b> fish species, such as salmon, shad, and eels, giving them time to form social groups and {{to adjust to the}} changes in salinity. Salmon are anadromous, meaning they live in the sea but ascend rivers to spawn; eels are <b>catadromous,</b> living in rivers and streams, but returning to the sea to breed. Besides the species that migrate through estuaries, there are many other fish that use them as [...] "nursery grounds" [...] for spawning or as places young fish can feed and grow before moving elsewhere. Herring and plaice are two commercially important species that use the Thames Estuary for this purpose.|$|E
50|$|Because of its complex life cycle, {{the species}} face {{a broad range}} of threats, some of which are {{specific}} to certain growth stage. Being <b>catadromous,</b> the eels's reproductivity success depends heavily on free downstream passage for spawning migration. It also depends on the availability of diverse habitats for growth and maturation.|$|E
50|$|Because the eels are <b>catadromous</b> (living {{in fresh}} water but {{spawning}} in the sea), dams and other river obstructions can block {{their ability to}} reach inland feeding grounds. Since the 1970s, {{an increasing number of}} eel ladders have been constructed in North America and Europe to help the fish bypass obstructions.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two main}} forms of the species. The inland form lives in lakes, while the coastal form lives in rivers and swims down into {{brackish}} estuaries to breed. A <b>catadromous</b> species, it is tolerant {{of high and low}} salinities. It is generally a bottom-dwelling species. It is nocturnal, feeding at night.|$|E
50|$|Some {{researchers}} consider G. gangeticus to be amphidromous, covering {{more than}} 100 km in both directions. However, {{this is not}} thought to be for breeding, as the case in anadromous and <b>catadromous</b> species. The presence of newborn individuals in the Hooghly River suggests that the young may be born in fresh water.|$|E
5000|$|The {{barramundi}} or Asian {{sea bass}} (Lates calcarifer) is {{a species of}} <b>catadromous</b> fish in family Latidae of order Perciformes. The species is widely distributed in the Indo-West Pacific region from Southeast Asia to Papua New Guinea and Northern Australia. Known in Thai language as pla kapong, it is very popular in Thai cuisine.|$|E
50|$|The European eel (Anguilla anguilla) is {{a species}} of eel, a snake-like, <b>catadromous</b> fish. They can reach a length of 1.5 m in {{exceptional}} cases, but are normally around 60 - 80 cm, and rarely reach more than 1 m. While captive specimens have lived over 85 years, the species' lifespan in the wild has not been determined.|$|E
50|$|Migrations {{involves}} the fish {{moving from one}} part of a water body to another on a regular basis. Some particular types of migration are anadromous, in which adult fish live in the sea and migrate into fresh water to spawn, and <b>catadromous,</b> in which adult fish live in fresh water and migrate into salt water to spawn.|$|E
50|$|Philadelphia's {{waterways}} were historically home to spawning {{populations of}} American shad {{and several other}} species of anadromous fish. The American eel, a <b>catadromous</b> fish was also noted to traverse Philadelphia's waters. There are numerous native fish species within the Delaware Estuary and Philadelphia’s freshwater tributaries. However, Philadelphia Water focuses a majority of its monitoring efforts on American shad.|$|E
50|$|Historically, {{anadromous}} spawning runs of alewife, blueback herring, striped bass, and American shad and <b>catadromous</b> runs of American eel {{were common}} in the NYC/NJ harbor estuary. However, poor stream conditions and an increased number of obstacles to upstream migration, like tide gates, culverts, and dams, have reduced these species’ migration opportunities. Restoring fish passage on major tributaries like the Rahway can be accomplished {{through the construction of}} fish ladders.|$|E
50|$|Many {{species of}} fish do {{reproduce}} in freshwater, but {{spend most of their}} adult lives in the sea. These are known as anadromous fish, and include, for instance, salmon, trout and three-spined stickleback. Some other kinds of fish are, on the contrary, born in salt water, but live most of or parts of their adult lives in fresh water; for instance the eels. These are known as <b>catadromous</b> fish.|$|E
50|$|Macrobrachium vollenhoveni, the African river prawn, is {{a species}} of large, commercially {{important}} prawn from the family Palaemonidae from West Africa. It is a <b>catadromous</b> species that moves from freshwater to brackish water to spawn returning to freshwater as larvae. Recent {{research has shown that}} it could potentially be used as a biological control to reduce the rates of infection people living near rivers here this species occurs with schistosomiasis.|$|E
50|$|This elusive fish is <b>catadromous</b> in nature; it migrates to {{the ocean}} to breed. It swims to salt water to spawn from October to December and returns to {{upstream}} ponds after. It undergoes upstream migration during December, January, and February, and this coincides with the “ipon-run phenomenon’ wherein different species of fish fry also undergo upstream migration. After the ludong had undergone downstream migration, it can be caught in Cagayan River and tributaries.|$|E

5000|$|An eel ladder is type of {{fish ladder}} {{designed}} to help eels swim past barriers, such as dams and weirs or even natural barriers, to reach upriver feeding grounds. (Many eels are <b>catadromous,</b> living in fresh water but spawning at sea.) The basic design of an eel ladder has the eel swim over the barrier using an eel ascending ramp, which provides the eels a climbing substrate to [...] "push against" [...] while slithering upstream. For some higher barriers, elevator-style systems are also used.|$|E
