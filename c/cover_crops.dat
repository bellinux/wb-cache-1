40|$|Diversification of {{cropping}} systems raises new {{questions in the}} functioning of arthropod communities and biological control of pests. In banana {{cropping systems}}, {{the addition of a}} <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> can increase biodiversity in general and the diversity and abundance of arthropod generalist predators in particular. We measured the abundance of a major pest of bananas, the banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus, in plots with a <b>cover</b> <b>crop,</b> Paspalum notatum, and in plots with bare soil; all plots had banana plants. We also measured the effect of the <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> on the damage done to corms by weevil larvae and on banana fruit biomass. The addition of the <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> reduced numbers of mature C. sordidus adults but failed to reduce damage to corms. The proportion of young adults, which reflects survival of eggs and larvae, was higher in <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> plots than in bare soil plots and was negatively correlated with the abundance of the earwig Euborellia caraibea. Fruit biomass was lower in <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> plots, perhaps because of competition between the banana <b>crop</b> and the <b>cover</b> <b>crop.</b> (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
50|$|Thick <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> stands often compete {{well with}} weeds during the <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> growth period, and can prevent most germinated weed seeds from {{completing}} their life cycle and reproducing. If the <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> is {{left on the}} soil surface rather than incorporated into the soil as a green manure after its growth is terminated, it can form a nearly impenetrable mat. This drastically reduces light transmittance to weed seeds, which in many cases reduces weed seed germination rates (Teasdale 1993). Furthermore, even when weed seeds germinate, they often run out of stored energy for growth before building the necessary structural capacity {{to break through the}} <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> mulch layer. This is often termed the <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> smother effect (Kobayashi et al. 2003).|$|R

Integrated pest management attempts to use all of these methods to keep pest populations below the number which would cause economic loss, and recommends pesticides as a last resort.|$|E
25|$|Slash-and-burn {{and other}} {{unsustainable}} methods of subsistence farming are practiced in some lesser developed areas.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> mixture diversity on <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> function. Specifically, this study evaluated the effect of <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> species and functional richness on aboveground biomass productivity, weed suppression, soil nutrient retention, soil microbial community characteristics, and performance stability. Twenty to forty <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> treatments were replicated three to four times at eleven sites across southeastern Nebraska using a pool of eighteen species representing three <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> species each from six pre-defined functional groups: cool-season grasses, cool-season legumes, cool-season brassicas, warm-season grasses, warm-season legumes, and warm-season broadleaves. Each species was planted in monoculture and the most diverse treatment contained all eighteen species. Remaining treatments represented intermediate levels of <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> species and functional richness. <b>Cover</b> <b>crop</b> planting dates ranged from late July to late September with both <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> and weed aboveground biomass being sampled prior to winterkill. Soil samples were taken in the following spring and analyzed for soil extractable nitrate, phosphorus, potassium, sulfate, and chloride as well as extracted for fatty acid methyl esters to characterize soil microbial biomass and community structure. Performance stability was assessed by evaluating the variability in <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> biomass for each treatment across plots within each site. While increasing <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> mixture diversity increased average aboveground biomass productivity, I argue that this was simply the result of the average performance of the monocultures being drawn down by low yielding species rather than due to niche complementarity or increased resource use efficiency. Furthermore, while increases in <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> mixture diversity were often correlated with increases in weed suppression, increases in soil nutrient retention, increases in soil microbial biomass, alterations in soil microbial community structure, and increases in performance stability, I argue that this was a result of diversity co-varying with aboveground biomass, and that differences in aboveground biomass rather than differences in diversity drove the differences observed in weed suppression, nutrient retention, soil microbial community characteristics, and stability. The results of this study contradict many popular hypotheses regarding the relationship between plant mixture diversity and function. ...|$|R

This study forms {{part of an}} ARC Nietvoorbij {{research}} project on the long-term effect of different groundcover management practices in vineyards. This study concentrated on the root distribution of the vines after different groundcover practices were used for one decade. The vineyard on the research farm of the Agricultural Research Council at Robertson, South Africa, was divided into 56 equally distributed trail blocks, 14 treatments with four replicas each. For the study Chardonnay cultivar on 99 Richter rootstock was used. This study concentrated on only eight treatments. The eight different <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> practices consisted of the mechanical treatment, chemical treatment, straw mulch treatment, permanent <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> treatment and four annual <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> treatments. The annual <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> treatments consisted of triticale <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> that was sprayed with an herbicide before bloom, a triticale <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> that was left to die naturally, a grazing vetch <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> that was sprayed with an herbicide before bloom and a grazing vetch <b>cover</b> <b>crop</b> that was left to die naturally.

25|$|In agriculture, {{many farmers}} could use less fertilizer, and the {{reductions}} in crop yields would be small or nonexistent. Runoff from corn fields is particularly avoidable because corn’s roots penetrate {{only the top}} few inches of soil and assimilate nutrients for only two months of the year. In addition, nitrogen losses can be reduced by 30 percent or more if farmers plant winter <b>cover</b> <b>crops,</b> such as rye or wheat, which can help the soil hold nitrogen. These crops also increase carbon sequestration in soils, mitigating climate change. Better yet is to grow perennial plants such as grasses rather than corn; nitrogen losses are many times lower. Nitrogen pollution from concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) is a huge problem.|$|E

25|$|Since AM fungi are biotrophic, {{they are}} {{dependent}} on plants {{for the growth of}} their hyphal networks. Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in <b>cover</b> <b>crops</b> systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield.|$|E

50|$|In {{reduced tillage}} strategies, weed {{suppression}} can be difficult. In place of cultivation, a farmer can suppress weeds by managing a <b>cover</b> <b>crop,</b> mowing, crimping, or herbicide application.

50|$|Integrating certain crops, {{especially}} <b>cover</b> <b>crops,</b> into {{crop rotations}} {{is of particular}} value to weed management. These crops crowd out weed through competition.
