After the war, in 1784, John R. Myer sold the neck to Newberry Davenport [...] from whom the neck derives its current name. Davenport later {{acquired}} the rights of Hewlett, and, from time to time, until 1820, bought up the small parcels of salt meadow of one to five acres on the neck that had been owned {{by a number of}} the early settlers of the town as <b>common</b> lands <b>appurtenant</b> to their several farms on the mainland.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{in medieval}} England the common was an {{integral}} part of the manor, and was thus part of the estate held by the lord of the manor under a feudal grant from the Crown or a superior peer, who in turn held his land from the Crown which owned all land. This manorial system, founded on feudalism, granted rights of land use to different classes. These would be appurtenant rights, that is the ownership of rights belonged to tenancies of particular plots of land held within a manor. A commoner would be the person who, for the time being, was the occupier of a particular plot of land. Some rights of common were said to be in gross, that is, they were unconnected with tenure of land. This was more usual in regions where commons are more extensive, such as in the high ground of Northern England or on the Fens, but also included many village greens across England and Wales. Most land with <b>appurtenant</b> <b>commons</b> rights is adjacent to the common or even surrounded by it, but in a few cases it may be some considerable distance away.|$|R
