40|$|This paper {{defines the}} spacetime {{geometry}} attached with observor as vacuum geometry (it defines the idea physical measurement geometry) and the spacetime geometry attached with matter as spacetime geometry. The initial spacetime geometry attached with matter {{is taken as}} refference geometry (named as initial co-moving <b>coordinator</b> <b>system),</b> and the current spacetime geometry attached with matter (named as current co-moving <b>coordinator</b> <b>system)</b> {{is determined by the}} four-dimensional displacement field measured in initial spacetime geometry. Matter motion is expressed by the motion transformation of basic vectors of four-dimensional co-moving <b>coordinator</b> <b>system.</b> The transformation of motion expressed by displacement describes the transient geometry form of matter motion. In general relativity theory and in gauge field theory, the geometrical invariant of word-line distance is used to define the geometry of space-time continuum. However, based on this research, this is only true when the time-shift is in special form. For more complicated matter motion, the gauge field theory and general relativity will be failed. The paper shows that traditional physical conservation laws and the geometrical invariant introduced by the gauge field theory and general relativity are included in the finite geometrical field theory as simple special cases.

By this way, the instant deformation gradient (expressed by spatial velocity gradient) concept is established. Based on this geometrical understanding, the strain rate and stress is expressed by local rotation tensor which is simply based on the fluid material kinetic energy concept (ruling out the concept of fluid-stretching). For fluid filling-in experiments, the characteristic of turbulence is analyzed geometrically and, then, the Navier-Stokes equation is used to get the analytical solution in first-order approximation. For convenient the comprising with experiments, the related typical values are given. As this solution is very basic, it can be expected be valuable for industrial application.

30|$|Another {{option that}} has been {{considered}} {{is the use of}} spirometry to monitor lung volume. Tomiyama et al. [16] used a respiratory monitor to trigger an electric light bulb as an indication of a similar level of breath-hold, resulting in a high diagnostic accuracy (96 %) in CT-guided biopsy of small (<[*] 15  mm) lung nodules. The active breathing <b>coordinator</b> <b>system</b> (Elekta Instrument AB, Stockholm, Sweden) is a clinically available system used to actively monitor lung volume and suspend the patient’s breathing. A valve closes and holds respiration at a certain level, to facilitate consisted tumour position for gated radiotherapy. From a practical standpoint, spirometry seems less suited for interventional procedures, because it prevents communication from patient to physician. If any breath were to escape from the mouthpiece, the procedure would no longer be reliable.|$|E
40|$|How does aid {{coordination}} {{work within}} the United Nations, and {{how can it be}} improved? This study examines the role of resident coordinators – normally the UN’s highest ranking official on the ground – in forging coherence among the three dozen organisations that together form the UN development system. A functioning system of resident coordinators has been deemed key for the functioning of the UN development system overall. The proliferation of actors and the fragmentation of aid are important determinants for the organization of development cooperation, including for the UN development system. Against this background, the study considers the case for aid coordination within the United Nations, examines its institutional setup, historical evolution and differentiation over time. A particular focus concerns the United Nations Development Programme as manager of the resident <b>coordinator</b> <b>system.</b> The study offers relevant lessons on how to mandate, organize and manage aid coordination at the country-level...|$|E

40|$|Engineering asset {{management}} (EAM) {{is a broad}} discipline and the EAM functions and processes are characterized by its distributed nature. However, engineering asset nowadays mostly relies on self-maintained experiential rule bases and periodic maintenance, which is lacking a collaborative engineering approach. This research proposes a collaborative environment integrated by a service center with domain expertise such as diagnosis, prognosis, and asset operations. The collaborative maintenance chain combines asset operation sites, service center (i. e., maintenance operation <b>coordinator),</b> <b>system</b> provider, first tier collaborators, and maintenance part suppliers. Meanwhile, to realize the automation of communication and negotiation among organizations, multiagent system (MAS) technique is applied to enhance the entire service level. During the MAS design processes, this research combines Prometheus MAS modeling approach with Petri-net modeling methodology and unified modeling language to visualize and rationalize the design processes of MAS. The major contributions of this research include developing a Petri-net enabled Prometheus MAS modeling methodology and constructing a collaborative agent-based maintenance chain framework for integrated EAM...|$|E
40|$|Data-intensive and {{long-lasting}} applications {{running in}} the form of workflows are being increasingly dispatched to cloud computing systems. Current scheduling approaches for graphs of dependencies fail to deliver high resource efficiency while keeping computation costs low, especially for continuous data processing workflows, where the scheduler does not perform any reasoning about the impact new input data may have in the workflow final output. To face such a challenge, we introduce a new scheduling criterion, Quality-of-Data (QoD), which describes the requirements about the data that are worthy of the triggering of tasks in workflows. Based on the QoD notion, we propose a novel service-oriented scheduler planner, for continuous data processing workflows, that is capable of enforcing QoD constraints and guide the scheduling to attain resource efficiency, overall controlled performance and task prioritization. To contrast the advantages of our scheduling model against others, we developed WaaS (Workflow-as-a-Service), a workflow <b>coordinator</b> <b>system</b> for the Cloud where data is shared among tasks via cloud columnar database...|$|E

40|$|Problem: This paper {{addresses}} {{the design of}} an intelligent software system for the IC (incident commander) of a team in order to coordinate actions of agents (field units or robots) {{in the domain of}} emergency/crisis response operations. Objective: This paper proposes GICoordinator. It is a GIS-based assistant software agent that assists and collaborates with the human planner in strategic planning and macro tasks assignment for centralized multi-agent coordination. Method: Our approach to design GICoordinator was to: analyze the problem, design a complete data model, design an architecture of GICoordinator, specify required capabilities of human and system in coordination problem solving, specify development tools, and deploy. Result: The result was an architecture/design of GICoordinator that contains system requirements. Findings: GICoordinator efficiently integrates geoinformatics with artifice intelligent techniques in order to provide a spatial intelligent <b>coordinator</b> <b>system</b> for an IC to efficiently coordinate and control agents by making macro/strategic decisions.

40|$|Gaomiaozi (GMZ) {{bentonite}} {{has been}} chosen {{as a potential}} buffer/backfill material for deeply buried geological disposal system to isolate high-level radioactive waste (HLW) in China. The Beishan area located in Gansu Province {{has been identified as}} the most suitable area for a national repository for radioactive waste. Since the groundwater in this region contains the total dissolved solid (TDS) with as cation Na+ and anions Cl- and SO 42 -, NaCl-Na 2 SO 4 was chosen as a TDS in the solution saturating GMZ sodium and calcium bentonites (called as GMZ Na- and Ca-bentonites respectively). In this paper, one-dimensional constant-volume tests were carried out on GMZ bentonite samples saturated with saline solutions with different TDS concentrations. Based on the concept of the montmorillonite (Mt) void ratio, the swelling characteristics of GMZ bentonites under fully saturated conditions were studied in distilled water and the saline solution conditions. The test results showed that the relationships of the Mt void ratio versus the swelling pressure could be represented by a series of straight lines in the double logarithmic <b>coordinator</b> <b>system</b> and these lines (corresponding to different concentrations of TDS) were parallel to each other. The experiment results revealed that the swelling pressure on a logarithmic scale changed linearly with the TDS concentration. A simple new method with different decay factors was proposed to describe the variation in the Mt void ratio in different saline solutions under the same stress. In addition, a microscopic prediction model was presented. The swelling pressures predicted by the proposed macroscopic method showed a good agreement with those obtained by the microscopic model...|$|E
