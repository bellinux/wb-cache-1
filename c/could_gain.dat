5|$|Throughout the book, Chomsky {{discusses}} {{what the}} Occupy movement {{is and what}} it is demanding, as well as advocating ways in which it <b>could</b> <b>gain</b> greater support and achieve governmental reforms, using historical examples as evidence. Press reviews were largely positive, with some noting that Chomsky had taken a more moderate, reformist position than they expected of him.|$|E
5|$|After Batista won the WWE Championship from John Cena at Elimination Chamber, Cena {{requested}} a rematch. Mr. McMahon agreed, {{on the condition}} that Cena must defeat Batista in a non-title match that night on Raw. Batista intentionally low-blowed Cena during the match to get disqualified and set up their match at WrestleMania. To build up their match, Batista interfered in several of Cena's matches in the weeks prior to WrestleMania, both attacking Cena or distracting him so that his opponent <b>could</b> <b>gain</b> the advantage.|$|E
5|$|Anticipating {{that the}} Confederates would march on Gettysburg {{from the west}} {{on the morning of}} July 1, Buford laid out his {{defenses}} on three ridges west of the town: Herr Ridge, McPherson Ridge and Seminary Ridge. These were appropriate terrain for a delaying action by his small cavalry division against superior Confederate infantry forces, meant to buy time awaiting the arrival of Union infantrymen who could occupy the strong defensive positions south of town at Cemetery Hill, Cemetery Ridge, and Culp's Hill. Buford understood that if the Confederates <b>could</b> <b>gain</b> control of these heights, Meade's army would have difficulty dislodging them.|$|E

5|$|Broadly speaking, however, {{it appears}} that the ships were well-handled and commanded. Contemporary {{observers}} were surprised to note that the crewmen, despite lacking white officers, had complete control of their warships and were able to stay in good formation as they circled around the bay. The rebels favored firing over the city or around government-controlled military targets rather than outright destruction, something that Zachary Morgan believes was motivated by either humanitarian concerns or (at the very least) pragmatism—by limiting the actual damage, they <b>could</b> <b>gain</b> support among legislators, the press, and general population. This has, however, caused a historiographical argument among scholars that persists to this day.|$|E
5|$|Dobell's Eastern Force {{consisted}} of two infantry divisions, the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division commanded by Major General W. Douglas and the 52nd (Lowland) Division commanded by Major General W. E. B. Smith, {{as well as the}} Anzac Mounted Division, a mounted infantry division commanded by Chauvel, the 5th Mounted Brigade commanded by Brigadier General E. A. Wiggin and the Imperial Camel Brigade commanded by Brigadier General Clement Leslie Smith. Murray considered this force to be under strength by at least a division for an advance to Beersheba, but felt he <b>could</b> <b>gain</b> El Arish and form an effective base on the coast, from which further operations eastwards could be supplied.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} too, a {{marriage}} was arranged between {{the son of}} Matad, Mormaer of Atholl, and the daughter of Haakon Paulsson, Earl of Orkney. The marriage temporarily secured the northern frontier of the Kingdom, and held out the prospect that a son of one of David's Mormaers <b>could</b> <b>gain</b> Orkney and Caithness for the Kingdom of Scotland. Thus, by the time Henry I died on 1 December 1135, David had more of Scotland under his control than ever before.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{contend that}} for the UN and North Korea, locked in a bitter battle where neither <b>could</b> <b>gain</b> the upper hand, {{logistics}} {{was among the most}} important determining factors in how the war would progress. As the disparity in logistics capability widened between the UN and North Korean forces, the well-supported UN troops were able to hold their positions along the Pusan Perimeter, while the morale and the fighting quality of NKPA deteriorated as resupplies became increasingly unreliable. This trend ultimately culminated in the UN recapturing Seoul, the key logistics center of the battle, and the collapse of the North Korean logistics system with the entire NKPA.|$|E
5|$|In 1911 {{the city}} adopted a {{commission}} form of government, which had three members elected by at-large voting. Considered to be progressive, {{as it would}} reduce the power of ward bosses, this change resulted in the elite white majority strengthening its power, as only the majority <b>could</b> <b>gain</b> election of at-large candidates. In addition, poor whites and blacks had already been disenfranchised. Mobile {{was one of the}} last cities to retain this form of government, which prevented smaller groups from electing candidates of their choice. But Alabama's white yeomanry had historically favored single-member districts in order to elect candidates of their choice.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, for {{the first}} time, Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini {{included}} Parliament in talks on the second Schengen Information System even though MEPs only needed to be consulted on parts of the package. After that experiment, Frattini indicated {{he would like to}} include Parliament in all justice and criminal matters, informally pre-empting the new powers they <b>could</b> <b>gain</b> as part of the Treaty of Lisbon. Between 2007 and 2009, a special working group on parliamentary reform implemented a series of changes to modernise the institution such as more speaking time for rapporteurs, increase committee co-operation and other efficiency reforms.|$|E

5|$|Murray {{pulled out}} of the match against Lithuania, so younger players <b>could</b> <b>gain</b> more {{international}} experience, and to allow him to focus on trying to win Grand Slam titles. His absence was criticised by Davis Cup captain John Lloyd. The Lithuanian side entered the tie as underdogs; fielding a team of teenagers, but Lithuania won 3–2. This {{was the first time that}} Great Britain had lost five ties in a row and was described as a humiliating Davis Cup defeat for Great Britain. It led to the resignation of John Lloyd as Davis Cup captain, with Britain now threatened with relegation to the lowest tier of the competition.|$|E
5|$|Nathan Bedford Forrest (1821–77) {{trained at}} Fort Wright. Forrest and other future {{leaders in the}} Confederate States Army and the Army of Tennessee {{received}} training at Fort Wright. The fort was Tennessee's first military training camp in which soldiers <b>could</b> <b>gain</b> experience {{in the construction of}} fortifications and the setup of artillery batteries. Fort Wright was the forwardmost defensive position on the Mississippi River until July 1861. In 2008, only a powder magazine is left of Fort Wright.|$|E
5|$|Although the scholar-officials viewed {{military}} {{soldiers as}} lower {{members in the}} hierarchic social order, a person <b>could</b> <b>gain</b> status and prestige in society by becoming a high-ranking military officer {{with a record of}} victorious battles. At its height, the Song military had one million soldiers divided into platoons of 50 troops, companies made of two platoons, battalions composed of 500 soldiers. Crossbowmen were separated from the regular infantry and placed in their own units as they were prized combatants, providing effective missile fire against cavalry charges. The government was eager to sponsor new crossbow designs that could shoot at longer ranges, while crossbowmen were also valuable when employed as long-range snipers. Song cavalry employed a slew of different weapons, including halberds, swords, bows, spears, and 'fire lances' that discharged a gunpowder blast of flame and shrapnel.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1859, PedroII {{departed}} {{on a trip to}} provinces {{north of}} the capital, visiting Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas, Pernambuco and Paraíba. He returned in February 1860 after four months. The trip was a huge success, with the Emperor welcomed everywhere with warmth and joy. The first half of the 1860s saw peace and prosperity in Brazil. Civil liberties were maintained. Freedom of speech had existed since Brazil's independence and was strongly defended by PedroII. He found newspapers from the capital and from the provinces an ideal way to keep track of public opinion and the nation's overall situation. Another means of monitoring the Empire was through direct contacts with his subjects. One opportunity for this was during regular Tuesday and Saturday public audiences, where anyone of any social class, including slaves, <b>could</b> <b>gain</b> admittance and present their petitions and stories. Visits to schools, colleges, prisons, exhibitions, factories, barracks and other public appearances presented further opportunities to gather first-hand information.|$|E
5|$|Capodacqua of La Repubblica {{believed}} that the route favored a rider that could defend well {{and put in a}} good time during the uphill time trial. La Stampa writer Gianni Ranieri felt the two non-uphill time trials would favor Gianni Bugno, while the up-hill time trial could be a place where Claudio Chiappucci <b>could</b> <b>gain</b> time on the field. Pedro Delgado believed the race to be tougher than the Tour de France that same year. The Cima Coppi – the highest point in altitude the race reached – was scheduled to be the Passo dello Stelvio, but the pass was scrapped from the race and the Passo Pordoi – the next highest mountain – became the new Cima Coppi.|$|E
5|$|Castro {{was known}} for his busy working hours, often only going to bed at 3 or 4 a.m. He {{preferred}} to meet foreign diplomats in these early hours, believing that they would be tired and he <b>could</b> <b>gain</b> the upper hand in negotiations. He described Ernest Hemingway as his favorite writer, and enjoyed reading but was uninterested in music. A sports fan, he also spent much of his time trying to keep fit, undertaking regular exercise. He took a great interest in gastronomy, as well as wine and whisky, and as Cuban leader was known to wander into his kitchen to discuss cookery with his chefs. Castro had a lifelong love of guns, and a preference for life in the countryside over the city.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before the}} mayoral election, there was support for Lane as a {{potential}} Democratic candidate for Vice President, though since {{he was born in}} what was by then a Canadian province he was ineligible under the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In an era when political convention delegates were far more free to make their own choices than they are today, Lane wrote that he had heard that he <b>could</b> <b>gain</b> the support of the New York delegation, which he declined to do. While returning to California from a trip to Washington, D.C., as an advocate for the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir project, he stopped in Austin, Texas, to confer with Democratic leaders and address the legislature. The New York Times saw this as part of a campaign to secure the vice-presidential nomination, and stated that he had been promised help from Texas.|$|E
5|$|Frederick William {{decided that}} he <b>could</b> <b>gain</b> little by {{continuing}} to battle the unexpectedly successful French forces, {{and that there were}} easier pickings for his army in the Kingdom of Poland. Accordingly, he stopped armed hostilities with the Republic and turned the state prisoners back over to his erstwhile coalition partner, the Habsburg Austrian monarch FrancisII, Holy Roman Emperor. Lafayette and his companions were initially sent to Neisse (today Nysa, Poland) in Silesia. On 17 May 1794, they were taken across the Austrian border, where a military unit was waiting to receive them. The next day, the Austrians delivered their captives to a barracks-prison, formerly a college of the Jesuits, in the fortress-city of Olmütz, Moravia (today Olomouc in the Czech Republic).|$|E
5|$|General Buford {{recognized}} the importance of the high ground directly to the south of Gettysburg. He knew that if the Confederates <b>could</b> <b>gain</b> control of the heights, Meade's army {{would have a hard time}} dislodging them. He decided to utilize three ridges west of Gettysburg: Herr Ridge, McPherson Ridge, and Seminary Ridge (proceeding west to east toward the town). These were appropriate terrain for a delaying action by his small division against superior Confederate infantry forces, meant to buy time awaiting the arrival of Union infantrymen who could occupy the strong defensive positions south of town, Cemetery Hill, Cemetery Ridge, and Culp's Hill. Early that morning, Reynolds, who was commanding the Left Wing of the Army of the Potomac, ordered his corps to march to Buford's location, with the XI Corps (Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard) to follow closely behind.|$|E
