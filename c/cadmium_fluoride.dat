Galvanized metals have a very heavy zinc coating. Exposure to zinc oxide fumes {{can lead to a}} sickness named [...] "metal fume fever". This condition rarely lasts longer than 24 hours, but severe cases can be fatal. Not unlike common influenza, fevers, chills, nausea, cough, and fatigue are common effects of high zinc oxide exposure.|$|R
40|$|Glasses and {{glass-ceramics}} {{have been}} obtained in oxyfluoride systems involving lead and <b>cadmium</b> <b>fluorides</b> {{and one of the}} well-known glass former oxides SiO 2, B 2 O 3 and TeO 2. Vitreous domains were established and a wide range of compositions including high heavy metal contents lead to stable glasses. Amorphous structures have been studied by short-range order spectroscopy techniques (Raman scattering and x-ray absorption) and molecular basic structures have been identified. Besides the usual oxides, the role of glass former could also be proposed for cadmium ions. Special attention has been paid for crystallization process. Cubic lead fluoride, cubic lead tellurite, tetragonal tellurium oxide and a solid solution of the type Pb 1 -xCdxF 2 are obtained as crystallization products depending on the composition and temperature of heat treatments. Pb 1 -xCdxF 2 solid solutions are well known superionic materials and obtaining this solid solution as a crystal phase could be very interesting for applications concerning ionic electrical conduction properties. The addition of rare earth ions led to the control of the crystallization process. In the presence of the nucleating ion only the cubic form beta-PbF 2 was identified. Rare earth ions are present in the crystal phase and crystal-like spectroscopic properties were observed suggesting interesting applications for these perfectly transparent glass ceramics in photonics...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: The {{presence}} of certain chemical compounds in dialysis water which enter patients’ bodies through haemodialysis can cause various {{problems such as}} acute poisoning, brain damage, osteoarthritis, Therefore, applying the standards for dialysis water is indispensible. This study was carried out to determine the chemical quality of water entrance to dialysis machines and its comparison with AAMI and EPH standards in the hospitals of Qom province. Methods: This is a descriptive-cross sectional study which was carried out on 45 samples of water entrance to dialysis machines in hospitals of Qom province. Since there were 3 hospitals in Qom having dialysis units, out of each one 15 samples were chosen as the samples of this study. The following machines were used for analysis of samples in the research: Atomic Absorption, DR 4000 and Flame photometer. The gathered data were then analyzed by independent t-test (p< 0. 5). Results: The means of all measured compounds were statistically lower than standard levels and had a significant difference with standard levels. The elements and compounds such as Lead, Zinc, Potassium, Sodium, Sulphate, Nitrate, and Chloride in all the measured samples were below the standard levels, but elements such as Aluminum, <b>Cadmium,</b> and <b>Fluoride</b> were above the standard levels in 13, 6 and 9 percent of samples, respectively. Conclusion: The {{results of the study}} showed that in all cases the means of all the studied compounds were below the standard levels, indicating high quality dialysis water in the hospitals. However, the {{presence of}} high level of elements such as Aluminum, <b>Cadmium,</b> and <b>Fluoride</b> compared with the standard levels signifies that much should be done in examining dialysis water...|$|R

50|$|<b>Cadmium</b> <b>fluoride</b> {{can cause}} {{potential}} health issues {{if it is}} not handled properly. It can cause irritation to the skin and the eyes, so gloves and protective eyewear are advised. The MSDS, or Material Safety Data Sheet, also includes warnings for ingestion and inhalation. Under acidic conditions, at high temperatures, and in moist environments, hydrogen fluoride and cadmium vapors may be released into the air. Inhalation may cause irritation of the respiratory system as well as congestion, fluorosis, and even pulmonary edema in extreme cases. <b>Cadmium</b> <b>fluoride</b> also has the same potential hazards caused by cadmium and fluoride.|$|E

The mine workers are exposed to dust of various potentially toxic substances. The common toxicants present in the mining environment are lead, mercury, <b>cadmium,</b> manganese, aluminium, <b>fluoride,</b> arsenic, etc. Inhalation and absorption through the skin are common routes of exposure. Low-dose chronic exposure of toxic substances results in the accumulation of toxicants in the body.

40|$|A {{selective}} medium (CFAT) {{was developed for}} the detection and enumeration of Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces naeslundii in dental plaque. Neutral acriflavin and potassium tellurite were used {{in combination with the}} known selective agents <b>cadmium</b> and <b>fluoride</b> to eliminate most of the competing plaque flora. Composition of CFAT per liter was as follows: Trypticase soy broth (BBL Microbiology Systems), 30 g; glucose, 5 g; agar, 15 g' cadmium sulfate, 13 mg; sodium fluoride, 85 mg; neutral acriflavin, 1. 20 mg; potassium tellurite, 2. 50 mg; basic fuchsin, 1. 25 mg; defibrinated sheep blood, 50 ml. A. viscosus reference strains of human origin grew on CFAT without reduction in numbers under an atmosphere of 90 % air- 10 % CO 2. Animal strains of A. viscosus were inhibited at the level of cadmium in CFAT. Two of six A. naeslundii strains did not grow on CFAT. Improved recovery of A. viscosus and A. naeslundii from dental plaque occurred on CFAT, as compared with two other selective media which contained either cadmium sulfate or sodium fluoride, respectively, as selective agents. CFAT was more selective with regard to much of the extraneous gram-positive flora. Bacterionemia, Neisseria, yeasts, and streptococci were virtually eliminated...|$|R

An efficient IR (803 nm) -to-green upconversion via three-step absorption is also reported, for the fist time, in Er 3 + doped strontium fluoride at 300 K.

40|$|Monocrystalline <b>cadmium</b> <b>fluoride</b> is a {{dielectric}} solid {{that can}} be converted into a semiconductor by doping with donor impurities and subsequent heating in the reduction atmosphere. For two donor elements, Ga and In, the donor (“shallow”) state is a metastable one separated from the ground (“deep”) state by a barrier. Photoinduced deep-to-shallow state transition underlies the photochromism of CdF 2 :Ga and CdF 2 :In. Real-time phase holograms are recorded in these crystals capable of following up optical processes in a wide frequency range.

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 Holographic {{techniques}} {{were used to}} study the optical properties and bistable behavior of Ga-doped <b>cadmium</b> <b>fluoride.</b> Ga impurities form bistable centers in CdF₂. Illumination causes a phototransformation from a deep to shallow center, which causes {{a change in the}} index of refraction. This change is caused by a redistribution of electrons in the centers, and is known as the photorefractive effect. The photorefractive effect makes it possible to write holographic patterns into the material. Using intersecting laser beams, a holographic grating was written into the sample, and the behavior of this grating was studied. The decay and efficiency of the grating are temperature dependent. The thermal decay that is responsible for erasing the grating is a two-center process. The thermal activation energy between the centers is about 780 meV...|$|E
30|$|CKDu is an {{epidemic}} affecting agricultural communities of NCP in Sri Lanka. CKDu patients in Sri Lanka {{as well as}} in El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica have been found similar renal pathological and epidemiological characteristics where this condition has been named as Chronic Interstitial Nephritis in Agricultural Communities more recently. Existing hypotheses suggest exposure to occupational and environmental toxins in agriculture as a primary trigger and dehydration caused by inadequate fluid intake in a hot environment as a contributory factor of this disease. Previous research suggests <b>cadmium,</b> aluminium, <b>fluoride,</b> Na+/Ca 2 + ratio, algal toxins and glyphosate complexation with hardness of water as possible CKDu-causing factors in NCP. Agricultural communities in CKDu endemic area obtain drinking water mainly from shallow wells. This research was designed to examine the possible CKDu risk factors in drinking water from shallow wells in NCP of Sri Lanka. Drinking water from CKDu patients and non-patients was drawn from Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa districts. Water samples were examined for chloride (Cl−), fluoride (F−), nitrate (NO 3 −), phosphate (PO 43 −), calcium (Ca 2 +), magnesium (Mg 2 +), sodium (Na+), cadmium (Cd 2 +) and arsenic (As 3 −).

40|$|A {{sensor array}} {{comprising}} 9 potentiometric chemical sensors and some pattern recognition tools {{for the data}} processing has been applied in order to characterize the groundwater in the plain of Kairouan Region (Tunisia). A total of 17 groundwater samples were collected from three different villages and analyzed for their chemical components. Nine chemical parameters were determined: Potassium, Sodium, Calcium, Ammonium, <b>Cadmium,</b> Chlorides, Nitrates, <b>Fluoride</b> and pH. Multi-sensor responses measured in each water sample were diagnosed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Cluster Analysis (CA). PCA is a procedure for reducing data redundancy. CA is used to detect spatial similarity among sampling sites.

40|$|It {{is shown}} {{experimentally}} that subinhibitory concentrations {{of a number}} of toxic, or other agents that are typically inhibitory (copper, <b>cadmium,</b> tributyl tin <b>fluoride,</b> reduced salinity), may stimulate the growth of colonies of the hydroid Campanularia flexuosa, exhibiting a phenomenon known as hormesis. It is suggested that the stimulation of growth is not due to the specific properties of the different toxicants, but to an adaptive response of the hydroid to the inhibitory effect that they have in common. Growth is regulated by a control mechanism and it is proposed that the increased growth is a consequence of overcorrections to low levels of an inhibitory challenge. Examination of the toxicological literature shows that hormesis is a more common occurrence that is generally supposed, and it is suggested that the explanation given here might apply in other cases of hormesis...|$|R

40|$|Absorption, {{excitation}} and emission {{spectra of}} <b>cadmium</b> <b>fluoride</b> crystals doped with rare-earth ions were investigated. In contrast to alkaline-earth fluorides the absorption spectra due to 4 f - 5 d transitions of Ce$^{ 3 +}$, Pr$^{ 3 +}$ and Tb$^{ 3 +}$ ions are broadened. No 5 d- 4 f emissions were observed. These prove that 5 d(e$_g$) levels of rare earth ions lie in conduction band of CdF$_ 2 $ crystal. Emission spectra of Tb$^{ 3 +}$ show {{the group of}} 4 f- 4 f $^ 5 $D$_ 4 $-$^ 7 $F$_j$ lines in contrast to other alkaline-earth fluorides where emission due to $^ 5 $D$_ 3 $-$^ 7 $F$_j$ transitions is also observed. The absence of the emission is due to position of $^ 5 $D$_ 3 $ level within condution band. Among the all measured crystals doped with impurity ions (Pr, Nd, Eu, Ho, Tb, Tm, Yb, Ga, In or Mn), the CdF$_ 2 $ doped with Pr$^{ 3 +}$, Tb$^{ 3 +}$, or Mn$^{ 2 +}$ ions have the highest light outputs under x-ray excitation.

40|$|Many {{remote areas}} in {{developing}} countries are not served with ample portable water. The main source of drinking water for some affected communities is usually groundwater. However, contamination of groundwater by heavy metals and fluoride has {{received a lot of}} attention in recent years due to excessive concentration levels of the contaminants above the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommended drinldng water quality standards. The aim {{of the study was to}} examine the treatment efficacy of low cost, locally available indigenous materials in removing heavy metals and fluoride from groundwater to provide potable quality drinldng water. Application of plant-based materials is enviromnental friendly, cost effective as it is locally available, non-toxic, easy to prepare and the residual generated is easy to dispose. Based on the literature, four plant-based materials namely Moringa oleifera (Moringa seeds), Musa Cavendish (banana peel), Cicer arietinum (chick peas) and Cocos nucifera (coconut solid endosperm) were selected as coagulants to examine their potential on heavy metal and fluoride removal. Coagulation tests with individual coagulants and their combinations were conducted, with different coagulant dosages applied to multi-element synthetic groundwater samples prepared with known concentrations of arsenic, lead, nickel, <b>cadmium</b> and <b>fluoride.</b> The best removal efficiency was achieved by Moringa oleifera combined with Musa cavendish either dosed in a mixing or sequential manner.

30|$|Many other {{researchers}} have suggested other factors to cause CKDu in NCP. Triple superphosphate (TSP) fertilizer imported for paddy farming in Sri Lanka {{has been found to}} contain cadmium as an impurity (Bandara et al. 2010). Cadmium is a known nephrotoxin and urinary excretion of cadmium {{is considered to be a}} reliable indicator of cumulative long-term exposure to cadmium (WHO 1992). Jayatilake et al. (2013) indicate a significantly higher cadmium concentration in the nails of CKDu cases compared to controls from the endemic area in Sri Lanka. Jayasumana et al. (2017) indicate that mean concentration of cadmium in urine in CKDu patients was significantly higher (1.039  mg/g) compared to controls in the endemic (0.646  mg/g) and non-endemic areas (0.345  mg/g). Levels of cadmium in lotus and tobacco have been found to be higher in CKDu endemic area in Sri Lanka compared to non-endemic areas by Jayatilake et al. (2013). However, cadmium levels in drinking water of CKDu patients in NCP has been found to be below WHO recommended maximum tolerance limit of 5  μg/L (WHO 2012; Wasana et al. 2012; Jayatilake et al. 2013). Dharma-wardana (2018) explains contaminated fertilizer cannot be considered the origin of higher levels of cadmium found in agricultural soils due to run-off during monsoons and conversion of impurities (Cd or As) to bio-unavailable forms held in the soil. According to Dharma-wardana (2018), the toxicities of <b>cadmium</b> and <b>fluorides</b> are both enhanced by their mutual presence with three times of joint toxicity than MAL of cadmium in soft water.|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{examines the}} occupational health {{risks associated with}} welding, brazing, and thermal cutting, and it provides criteria for eliminating or minimizing the risks encountered by workers in these occupations. The main health concerns are increased risks of lung cancer and acute or chronic respiratory disease. The data in this document indicate that welders have a 40 % increase in relative risk of developing lung cancer {{as a result of}} their work experience. The basis for this excess risk is difficult to determine because of uncertainties about smoking habits, possible interactions among the various components of welding emissions, and possible exposures to other occupational carcinogens. However, the risk of lung cancer for workers who weld on stainless steel appears to be associated with exposure to fumes that contain nickel and chromium. The severity and prevalence of noncarcinogenic respiratory conditions are not well characterized among welders, but they have been observed in both smoking and nonsmoking workers in occupations associated with welding. Excesses in morbidity and mortality among welders exist even when reported exposures are below current Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) permissible exposure limits (PELs) for the many individual components of welding emissions. An exposure limit for total welding emissions cannot be established because the composition of welding fumes and gases varies for different welding processes and because the various components of a welding emission may interact to produce adverse health effects. Some of these include alkali metals, alkaline earths, aluminum, beryllium, <b>cadmium,</b> chromium, <b>fluorides,</b> iron, lead, manganese, nickel, silica, titanium, zinc, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and ozone. NIOSH therefore recommends that exposures to all welding emissions be reduced to the lowest feasible concentrations using state-of-the-art engineering controls and work practices. Exposure limits for individual chemical or physical agents are to be considered upper boundaries of exposure. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 CurrentPrevention and ControlEnvironmental Healt...|$|R
40|$|The {{concentration}} of different toxic metals has increased beyond environmentally and ecologically permissible levels {{due to the}} increase in industrial activity. More than 100 million people of Bangladesh and West Bengal in India are affected by drinking ground water contaminated with arsenic and some parts of India is also affected by poisoning effect of copper, <b>cadmium</b> and <b>fluoride.</b> Different methods have been evolved to reduce the arsenic concentration in drinking water to a maximum permissible level of 10 μg/L where as various methods are also available to separate copper from drinking water. Of the proven methods available today, removal of arsenic by polymeric ion exchangers has been most effective. While chelating ion exchange resins having specific chelating groups attached to a polymer have found extensive use in sorption and pre {{concentration of}} Cu 2 + ions. Both the methods are coupled here to separate and preconcentrate toxic metal cation Cu 2 + and metal anion arsenate(AsO 4 –) at the same time. We have prepared a series of low-cost polymeric resins, which are very efficient in removing copper ion from drinking water and after coordinating with copper ion they act as polymeric ligand exchanger, which are efficiently removing arsenate from drinking water. For this purpose Schiff bases were prepared by condensing o-phenylenediamine with o-, m-, and p-hydroxybenzaldehydes. Condensing these phenolic Schiff bases with formaldehyde afforded the chelating resins in high yields. These resins are loaded with Cu 2 +, Ni 2 + 2 +, and Fe 3 + ions. The resins and the polychelates are highly insoluble in water. In powdered form the metal ion-loaded resins are found to very efficiently remove arsenate ion from water at neutral pH. Resins loaded with optimum amount of Cu 2 + ion is more effective in removing arsenate ions compared to those with Fe 3 + ion, apparently because Cu 2 + is a stronger Lewis acid than Fe 3 +. Various parameters influencing the removal of the arsenate ion from drinking water to a concentration level below 20 μg/L are studied...|$|R
40|$|Congenital heart defects are {{responsible}} for more neonatal deaths than any other birth defect. Although genetic and environmental factors play an important role, either separately or in combination (multifactorial), still the cause in most cases remains unknown. Changing life styles, e. g. exposure of the mother to excessive alcohol, nicotine in tobacco smoke, easily available traditional and, over the counter medicines and environmental contaminants could be possible causes of congenital malformations. Maternal diseases like diabetes mellitus are {{also one of the}} etiological factors for developmental defects. Several developmental genes, for instance connexin 43; one of the key proteins involved in cardiovascular development, and endothelin 1; another important gene required in many developmental processes, could be responsible for developmental anomalies of the heart. Supplementation with micronutrients such as folic acid and Vitamin C during the periconceptional period has been shown to prevent some neural tube and congenital heart defects. This study was aimed at evaluating the adverse effects of ethanol, retinoic acid, nicotine, <b>cadmium</b> chloride, sodium <b>fluoride,</b> ginseng and diabetic conditions on chick cardiomyocytes cultured in the micromass system, and examining the potential protective effects of folic acid and vitamin C. Also teratogenic effects of some of the teratogens, ethanol, nicotine, retinoic acid and diabetic conditions, were examined using in ovo culture. Hearts were dissected from 5 day old White Leghorn chick embryos and the cells were isolated and cultured. They were exposed to different concentrations of test chemicals. Folic acid and vitamin C were added to see any protective effects. Cell viability was assessed using the resazurin reduction assay and the kenacid blue assay was performed for determining cell number. For in ovo culture, day 3 chick embryos were injected with ethanol, nicotine, retinoic acid or diabetic molecules or a combination of teratogenic chemicals and vitamins (folic acid and vitamin C). Immunohistochemistry and western blotting were employed to detect the expression of connexin 43 and endothelin 1. Results of micromass culture revealed that ethanol, retinoic acid, nicotine, cadmium chloride and diabetic conditions dramatically reduced cellular differentiation, cell viability and protein content in a dose dependant manner. However, vitamin C (100 µM) and folic acid (1 mM) administered concurrently with these chemicals, except for cadmium chloride, could significantly improve all parameters such that the values were comparable with the control. Nicotine had no effect on cell viability and protein content, but cell beating was significantly affected. This effect was reversed by the addition of Vitamin C and folic acid. Results of in ovo culture showed that ethanol and diabetic conditions caused gross and histological malformations in chick embryos. However their effects were abrogated with supplemental folic acid and vitamin C. Immunohistochemical and western blotting results demonstrated a decreased expression of Cx 43 and endothelin 1 in ethanol, retinoic acid, nicotine and diabetic condition treated cells while addition of vitamins restored their expression so they were comparable to controls. It may be that environmentally induced teratogenic effects on heart development could be prevented by supplementation with Vitamin C and folic acid during pregnancy.
