The technical feasibility of using fiberoptics in the severe environments posed by cryogenic liquid-fueled rocket engines was determined. The issues of importance and subsequent requirements for this use of fiberoptics were compiled. These included temperature ranges, moisture embrittlement succeptability, and the ability to withstand extreme shock and vibration levels. Different types of optical fibers were evaluated and several types of optical fibers' ability to withstand use in cryogenic liquid-fueled rocket engines was demonstrated through environmental testing of samples. This testing included: cold-bend testing, moisture embrittlement testing, temperature cycling, temperature extremes testing, vibration testing, and shock testing. Three of five fiber samples withstood the tests to a level proving feasibility, and two of these remained intact in all six of the tests. A fiberoptic bundle was also tested, and completed testing without breakage. Preliminary cabling and harnessing for fiber protection was also demonstrated.

40|$|The {{conversation}} about the restoration materialization of historic buildings is an ongoing debate. Additions are allowed only {{if they do not}} detract from the interesting parts of the building, integrate harmoniously, yet are distinguishable to prevent architectural falsification of the monument. Completely transparent additions to historic buildings of structural glass can be an answer to all the above demands. As a research into these possibilities, a refurbishment proposal is made for the Ruin of Teylingen in the Netherlands. Here the original wood roof that is missing, is replaced by a structural glass roof. As a design research, the glass roof design has been elaborated in this graduation. The roof has the same shape and size of the original roof, and closes off the donjon, allowing a new function to be put in the castle. Laminated heat-strengthened glass beams are connected to a slender steel contour frame. To create a fluid curvature, laminated heat-treated <b>cold</b> <b>bend</b> glass panels are used, which are held in place by clamping joints, connected onto the glass beams. Passive climate measures are used to prevent overheating of the glass roof. A glass floor allows the roof {{to be used as a}} lookout point over the refurbished area around the castle. The design is checked by structural calculations. The product of the design process is an plausible and elegant solution for covering the historic building with an all glass roof that respects the historical and aesthetical value of the monument. This research has shown that if designed and detailing right, structural glass can be a very appropriate solution for the restoration of monumental buildings.

The {{cross sectional}} area of copper was calculated from trace resistance measurements. All the flex circuits had an acceptable amount of copper cross section. about 6 e- 8 m{sup 2 } for all except the Cirexx flex which had 4. 5 e- 8 m{sup 2 }. The thickness of the ribbons was 0. 006 -inch for the Litchfield and about 0. 004 -inch for the Cirexx and Speed circuit. The room temperature resistivity ratio (RRR) {{was measured to be}} 15 for all the circuits. This was expected and means that the trace material resistivity at helium temperatures is 1 / 15 th of what it is at room temperature. This is good from the standpoint of thermal heat load. Purer copper, with an RRR > 30 would result in an unacceptable heat load. The cryogenic cycling and bending tests to liquid nitrogen proved that both the Cirexx wide and Speedy circuit green were made of acceptable materials. Both Litchfield flex circuits had significant cracking of the coverlay when bent at cold temperatures and are not acceptable. The Litchfield narrow was in bad physical condition to start with and got worse through the testing with many more crazing cracks appearing. The crazing is bad enough that the coverlay began to peel and expose the copper beneath. This candidate is unacceptable. The Litchfield wide started out testing in good condition with no cracks. It ended up with much crazing in the coverlay. Within 1 mm of the edge of the coverlay at the cold end. the copper traces were bulged away from the base material. Traces became nadhered and lifted off of the base material at the ends where the coverlay was not present. Numerous electrical opens (7 out of 24 checked) were found {{at the end of the}} testing. Visual inspection of the opens leaves open the possibility that the traces are broken below the coverlay in the <b>cold</b> <b>bend</b> area. Obviously this candidate is unacceptable. The Cirexx wide was a mechanical sample with no promises made about it's electrical integrity, however of the traces checked all were fine after the brutal testing. This flex circuit appears suitable for the intended cryogenic and mechanical environment. The Speedy circuit came out as acceptable in the testing also. The material remained flexible at cryogenic temperatures. 2 out of 24 traces were found open after the testing, but this was a mechanical sample and those traces were not checked beforehand so it is unknown if the testing caused the opens or they were there at the start.

40|$|The {{demand for}} flat glass {{is high and}} {{increasing}} significantly in the building industry {{as a direct result}} of architectural requirements for lightness, transparency and natural light. Current architectural trends require glass in curvilinear forms for smooth free-form façades. Two principal challenges arise from this: to cost-effectively produce the desired curvature and; to ensure its safe performance after exposure to ageing. The recent availability of high strength glass provides an opportunity to address the first challenge by developing cold bent glass. <b>Cold</b> <b>bending</b> involves the straining of relatively thin glass components, at ambient temperatures, and is a low energy and cost effective manner of creating curvilinear forms. However, <b>cold</b> <b>bending</b> is not yet widely established as a reliable method. The aim of this thesis is to develop the understanding of cold bent glass during the bending process and to evaluate its post-ageing performance. This thesis, firstly, investigates the mechanical response of monolithic glass plates during the <b>cold</b> <b>bending</b> process. The stability of cold bent glass is investigated experimentally by bending it in double curved anticlastic shapes. A parametric numerical analysis involves different boundary conditions, geometrical plate characteristics and bending parameters. The principal outcome is that a local instability, now termed <b>cold</b> <b>bending</b> distortion, occurs when certain displacement limits are exceeded and could degrade the optical quality of the glass. An evaluation procedure is also formulated to set limits and aid designers/manufacturers to predict the mechanical response and the optical quality of the glass. Cold bent glass is subjected to permanent bending stresses throughout its service life and therefore, its strength degradation after ageing needs to be quantified. Analytical, experimental and numerical investigations are undertaken in this thesis to identify the most effective method for estimating glass strength (evaluation of destructive tests, required number of specimens, statistical analysis methods and sub-critical crack growth). The limited availability of naturally aged toughened glass and the absence of a reliable ageing standard impede the evaluation of its aged performance. Therefore, a parametric experimental investigation of artificial ageing methods on glass is undertaken in this thesis. A procedure for the evaluation of the strength of aged glass is finally, formulated to allow the selection of artificial ageing parameters that correspond to a target level of erosion. The knowledge on artificial ageing and strength prediction acquired above is finally implemented on different types of glass to determine their strength after ageing and assess their safe use in <b>cold</b> <b>bending</b> / load bearing applications. The investigation showed that fully toughened glass has a superior performance to chemically toughened or annealed glass. Overall, the research presented in this thesis demonstrates that high quality cold bent toughened glass can be created when certain applied displacement limits are respected. These can be used as a safe, cost-effective and energy efficient replacement to the more conventional hot bent glass. However, <b>cold</b> <b>bending</b> / load bearing applications in which the stressed glass surface is exposed to ageing, require glass with a relatively high case depth such as fully toughened or bi-tempered glass.

40|$|Abstract. Ovalization of {{tubes in}} <b>cold</b> <b>bending</b> {{operations}} causes dimensional inaccuracy {{that may lead}} to loss of fit-up and function of formed products. This distortion mechanism is governed by radial bending stress components forcing the extremities of the tube section towards the neutral layer. Thus, the magnitude of distortions is restricted by the instantaneous stiffness of the tube section upon bending. In order to consider tube ovalization in the product design process, it is necessary to develop a practical methodology that takes into account the impact of parameters such as material, tool and section geometries. The present work presents an analytical solution of the ovalization problem, using the deformation theory of plasticity. The results show that the diameter of the tube is the most important parameter, while the thickness of the tube section and the bending radius are of the same relative importance to ovalization. The developed model indicates that strain hardening is the most important material parameter, whereas tube ovalization is nearly unaffected by the initial yield stress. The model shows good correlation with experiments...|$|R
40|$|The {{variation}} in mechanical properties after <b>cold</b> deformation (<b>bending)</b> of pipes {{is one of}} the interesting subjects in material science. One major quality the material should possess is high corrosion resistance after cold deformation. The study deals with the observation of pitting corrosion resistant property of <b>cold</b> deformed (<b>bended)</b> tubes of 316 type and 6 Mo stainless steel. ASTM G 48 and ASTM G 61 test methods are followed as experimental procedure for the completion of this project. The Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) is used for the examination of pitting corrosion after G 48 Test. Similarly, the cyclic polarization graph is used for measuring the pitting and repassivation potential after G 61 Test. The cold deformed and the straight parts of both 316 SS and 6 Mo were seen to be holding a similar corrosion resistant property. The weight loss per unit area was found to be similar after G 48 test and the pitting and repassivation potential values were in a similar range. The hardness of bended parts for both 316 SS and 6 Mo are measured higher than the straight parts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} an investigation on <b>cold</b> <b>bending</b> process using simulation and experimental study. The experimental and simulation {{were performed on}} stainless steel 304 sheet metal in air V-bending. The factors {{involved in the process}} are punch radius, die radius, die gap, punch travel and punch velocity. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate the factors that affect the springback behavior of stainless steel in air V-bending using Finite Element Method (FEM) software Simufact-FormingTM version and material database MatILDa. The simulation parameters followed the actual setting under consideration of the machine characteristic and friction. The simufact. formingTM simulation was further verified using hydraulic press machine which determine the desired speed of the forming punch. As the final result, comparison effect of springback between simulation and experiment is presented. The simulated data from simufact. formingTM are in good agreement with experimental. Introduction. One of the most widely used process in sheet metal forming is bending. Bending of sheet metal forming is command and important process in the manufacturing industries to produce a various of automobiles, aircraft and casing of electronic parts. Common bending process in th...|$|R
40|$|Geometric {{anomalies}} {{in pipelines}} are mainly represented by dents, ovalities and buckles. Dents can occur either during pipeline construction or in-service. Buckles and wrinkles {{may result from}} <b>cold</b> <b>bending</b> or from loss of stability during offshore pipe-laying. The challenge to the pipeline operator is the identification of those defects that may threaten the future integrity of the pipeline from those defects that are dormant and require no further action. Codes and regulations contain limit state criteria to prevent buckles from happening during construction and in service; however, there is practically no acceptance guidance. In cases when buckles and wrinkles are identified, pipeline operators seek expert opinion. The current industry thinking and research supports the use of advanced assessment techniques (beyond the depth-based rules). These enhanced assessment techniques {{make use of the}} detailed profile of a geometry anomaly. Such information is obtained from high-resolution geometry tools and other supporting information on the presence and severity of stress risers from ILI tools. This paper describes how strain-based and stress-based assessment of geometric anomalies can be utilized to assess their significance and need for remediation. Examples are discussed to demonstrate application of the enhanced methods for the assessment of buckles...|$|R
