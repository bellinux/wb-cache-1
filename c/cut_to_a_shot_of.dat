2500|$|The title {{takes on}} yet another level of meaning {{a quarter of the}} way through the film, when Hanns Eisler's {{chilling}} score that has accompanied images of deportation is disrupted, as the train arrives at Auschwitz. The narrator observes that during the train ride [...] "death makes its first choice" [...] and [...] "a second is made upon arrival in the night and fog". The visuals <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> trains arriving in night and fog, which has become a metaphor for the mystery of their situation.|$|E
50|$|During the Nitro Girls’ opening dance routine on the October 6, 1997 {{edition of}} WCW Monday Nitro from the Target Center in Minneapolis, one of Chae’s nipples accidentally {{popped out of}} her top.

5000|$|A common {{example is}} a man walking up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> door and {{reaching}} for the knob. Just as his hand touches the knob, the scene <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> of the door opening from the other side.|$|R
5000|$|Marie slowdances with Abe {{by candlelight}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{saxophone}} version of [...] "When I Fall in Love" [...] {{and the scene}} abruptly <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> of Marie sitting at work with a faraway, daydream {{look on her face}} casting into doubt the source of the story.|$|R
50|$|In Marathon Man, Babe Levy (Dustin Hoffman) is {{interviewed by}} police in his {{apartment}} {{following the death of}} his brother Doc (Roy Scheider). During the interview, the camera <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> of Babe's desk, covered with research material for his thesis. Among several books on McCarthyism is a copy of Harvey Matusow's False Witness.|$|R
5000|$|When Susan Flannery's {{name was}} {{announced}} {{as the winner}} of the Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series Award, the [...] "Flannery" [...] part was unintelligible. Everybody in the television production booth thought it was Susan Lucci who was named, and therefore <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> Lucci (who was backstage at the time after presenting the previous award), cued the All My Children theme song, and told her to go on stage. Once the producers realized their mistake, they immediately cut to Flannery coming towards the stage, and Lucci returned backstage. The producers apologized for their mistake the following day.|$|E
50|$|That gives Sylvester {{the idea}} he wants: <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> Sylvester {{knocking}} on Granny's door. Granny opens it a crack and asks Sylvester what he's doing, to which Sylvester replies in his lisping voice, “Your bags, Madame.” Granny answers, “OK, they're behind the door. I'll {{see you in}} the lobby.” Sylvester enters Room 158 and picks up Granny's suitcases and Tweety's cage. He carries them all out into the hall, then discards the suitcase and carries the cage {{down the stairs to the}} rear of the apartment building. There, he walks into the alley and opens the cage, expecting to enjoy Tweety - but Granny is in the cage! She hits Sylvester with her umbrella several times in rapid succession.|$|E
5000|$|The opening title {{sequence}} {{was created}} by television director Reza S. Badiyi. Early shows began with a cold open suggesting the sinister plot for that program, then <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> a big ocean wave {{and the start of}} the theme song. A fast zoom-in to the top balcony of the Ilikai Hotel followed, showing McGarrett turning to face the camera, followed by many quick-cuts and freeze-frames of Hawaiian scenery, and Hawaiian-Chinese-Caucasian model Elizabeth Malamalamaokalani Logue turning to face the camera. [...] A grass-skirted hula dancer from the pilot episode was also included, played by Helen Kuoha-Torco, who later became a professor of business technology at Windward Community College. [...] The opening scene ended with shots of the supporting players, and the flashing blue light of a police motorcycle racing through a Honolulu street.|$|E
50|$|In {{the series}} finale, Ari informs Barbara of his {{immediate}} and permanent resignation from the agency, {{in order to}} spend time with his wife traveling around the world. During the closing credits of the final episode, the screen <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> of Ari and his wife relaxing on holiday. As his wife walks away, Ari receives a phone call from John Ellis asking Ari to replace him as chairman and CEO of Time Warner.|$|R
5000|$|The {{names of}} the various {{subsidiaries}} of the Very Big Corporation Of America are displayed in the board room, as a seemingly endless list covering the walls; the list {{was in fact a}} repeating sequence. Some of the names contain puns, or intentional in-jokes referencing other events in The Meaning of Life (such as the Live Organ Transplants sketch, which <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> of the sign painter in the board room inscribing [...] "Liver Donors Inc." [...] on the wall).|$|R
50|$|The song's {{music video}} begins with <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> of vocalist Christopher Hall {{standing}} in a desert, before falling backwards. The song begins with a woman singing the first verse. When the chorus starts, the video <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> of the band performing in the desert. At {{the end of the}} chorus, a car drives off. During the second verse, the video cuts between shots of the band performing and the car driving. At the video's end, the camera pulls around and reveals that Hall and the woman have both died.|$|R
5000|$|No {{critics have}} seen the film, but Ray {{described}} it in the following way: [...] "While they're reaching this point, I <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> a piece of telegraph wire. It's raining {{and there are two}} drops of rain approaching on a downward curve. It's a very poetic seven minutes. And the end is also very lively, very optimistic, with children, happy, laughing, smoking, singing. The whole thing builds up into a paean of praise for the place." [...] The documentary was screened for public viewing {{for the first time in}} 39 years at the 16th Kolkata Film Festival. Mathures Paul of The Statesman wrote in his review, [...] "Sandwiched between Pratidwandi, Seemabaddha and Asani Sanket, Sikkim is beautiful, more an essay from a respected travel journal from Ray’s era accompanied by detailed photographs that graced magazines like Life".|$|E
5000|$|We {{start off}} on the female head saying, [...] "The thing about Christmas is that it's the same old {{presents}} every year. This year though, I'm hoping to find six extra BBC channels under my tree." [...] In a male voice, as it transforms into a snowman, [...] "You can get the six extra BBC channels without subscription for a one-off payment of either £150 on free satellite, or for around £40 on Freeview." [...] As the snowman's head breaks apart, we can briefly hear the heads shout, [...] "FREEVIEW!" [...] And the female announcer says, [...] "Also available on cable and satellite subscription services, be part of something big. Call 08700 10 10 10, or visit your local retailer or supplier." [...] There's a 10-second version of this ad viewable on Justin Hewelt's YouTube channel. This version has the female head informing us, [...] "Getting digital TV this Christmas? Then look out for the logo." [...] We then <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> the heads flying past the Digital UK 'digital tick' logo.|$|E
5000|$|The show {{began with}} the opening {{sequence}} as Steve Higgins proclaiming [...] "From Studio 6B/6A in Rockefeller Center, the National Broadcasting Company presents Late Night with Jimmy Fallon!", and announced that night's guests and [...] "the legendary Roots crew". Just before Higgins introduced Fallon, the camera <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> The Roots, who then shouted three numbers symbolizing the episode number of Late Night (though other numbers and statements have been shouted in place based on current events, cities if that episode's number matches a particular city's area codes, and historical show moments - {{toward the end of}} the show's run, Questlove would shout how many episodes remained rather than the number of the show itself). As the camera panned over to the main stage, some members of The Roots performed actions to get the camera's attention (F. Knuckles saluted, Captain Kirk Douglas did a windmill chord, and Damon Bryson smiled while flashing a peace sign). Higgins then introduced Fallon with a drawn-out [...] "And here he is, Jimmy Fallon!", and Fallon began his brief monologue. Fallon often gave the cue cards for a joke to audience members if the joke fell particularly flat. Jimmy would segue directly from the final punchline of his monologue into saying, [...] "Ladies and gentlemen, we've got a great show for you tonight. Give it up for The Roots!", who would play briefly as Fallon walked to his desk.|$|E
50|$|In another scene, {{the film}} pokes {{fun at the}} Hays Code. Due <b>to</b> the code, <b>a</b> man and woman could not be shown in bed together. The camera begins the scene in a woman's bedroom, panning across {{the foot of the}} bed. A pair of men's shoes are shown on the floor, then a pair of women's shoes and then four horseshoes. The camera <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> of the entire room: Pinky is {{sleeping}} in one bed with the horse, while the woman is in another bed.|$|R
5000|$|The video then <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> final <b>shot</b> of the cropfield in night time, {{where there}} is a large crop circle with the words [...] "KoЯn III" [...] present in the middle.|$|R
5|$|After the Simpsons {{arrive at}} home, the camera <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> {{of them on}} the couch, then zooms out to show this as a picture hanging on the wall of a fictional {{overseas}} Asian animation and merchandise sweatshop. The animation color quickly becomes drab and gray, and the music turns dramatic à la Schindler's List. A large group of tired and sickly artists draw animation cels for The Simpsons among piles of human bones and toxic waste, and a female artist hands a barefoot child employee an animation cel, which he washes in a vat of biohazardous fluid.|$|R
5000|$|We see a male head {{opening his}} eyes and {{beginning}} to ask us, [...] "Is it me," [...] then the camera pulls back to reveal a giant version of the male head being held together by smaller heads, as it asks [...] "or does everyone seem to have digital television nowadays?" [...] "In fact, put us all together, and we make {{up most of the}} county," [...] it adds, before we <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> smaller heads bouncing towards the head. [...] "I like the programmes about the natural world," [...] it says, and we see the heads crashing {{into the back of the}} male head, after which the heads form that of a lion (to illustrate the nature programmes) before they break apart and form the head of World Affairs Editor John Simpson. [...] "There's also up-to-the-minute news, 24 hours a day," [...] it says, and we cut to a shot where the male head has reformed, and beneath him, we see the shadow of Shakespeare's head. [...] "Not to mention, gripping DRAMA!" [...] both heads announce, in a rather bombastic tone. [...] "You can get the six extra BBC channels on cable, satellite services, or Freeview," [...] the male head says, as we see him float past the camera. Turning to face us, it adds, [...] "No wonder everyone's getting it." [...] We then cut to an exterior panning shot of the heads flying past the hilltops, as a female announcer informs us, [...] "Be part of something big. Call 08700 10 10 10, or visit your local retailer or supplier." ...|$|E
50|$|Corbucci lets Clay {{reach the}} horizon, then <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> medium <b>shot</b> of Clay {{taking off his}} glasses, {{throwing}} them in the air, and shooting holes in both lenses. His sight, miraculously, has been completely restored.|$|R
50|$|It {{starts with}} Duff waking up on a couch, then sitting up to begin singing the song. Shortly after, the video <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> of her singing while {{sitting on a}} bench in her bedroom. After {{listening}} to music through headphones for a short while, she gets up, applies make-up, and puts on a black wig. She leaves her bedroom and rides around town in a car with several friends. She is then seen at various nightclubs in different cities. For the duration of the video, there are shots of her at different parties and clubs while she sings and clubgoers around her dance.|$|R
5000|$|In the end, Ching {{wakes up}} in hospital, where a doctor tells {{her that she was}} in {{critical}} condition, but saved by a kidney that belonged to the dead at the scene where she was found. She realizes that Ling hacked herself to death to give her the kidney she always wanted. Unable to digest this information, she starts screaming, begging the doctor to remove her kidney, as the camera <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> of Ching telling Ling they will always be together, and another of Ling lying dead with her voiceover saying, [...] "You'll owe me this forever." [...] There is <b>a</b> final <b>shot</b> of Ching, under the effect of sedatives, falling unconscious.|$|R
50|$|The scene <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> of Abe in {{hospital}} {{surrounded by his}} family. He wakes up and they report {{that he has been}} in a coma for two months after being hit by a car in the office parking lot. Miranda is there and tells him that she didn't know him and was never attracted to him but then adds that she cares. She doesn't specify about what she cares and refuses to answer his questions about what. She leaves, saying that she is not pregnant despite Abe's mother's belief, and Abe flatlines. He recovers only to develop hepatitis and jaundice. He talks with Marie, forcefully kisses her (thereby contaminating her) and flatlines again.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the first}} chorus, it <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> at night-time, with {{various members of}} the band walking around the camera and {{therefore}} continuing {{on the other side of}} the frame. There are also shots of them performing the song in the dimly lit forest, and other shots where they are letting off flares, creating a bright red haze in the dark forest as the band plays. [...] This scene also features an almost hand-held camera effect with the camera zooming in up close and then crossing to other members of the band, bending the image in the process. The outro features heavy psychedelic panning effects, <b>to</b> create <b>a</b> dizzying and disorienting effect. The song finishes and the band put down their instruments and walk away.|$|R
50|$|The {{music video}} {{was shot in}} Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan. It begins with {{outlined}} illustrations representing Clara in pink and Alice in blue which are seen throughout the video. A young girl and her mother are shown looking into an ice cream shop at a parfait, which then <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> of the girl dancing to the music alongside the illustrations of Clara and Alice. Other people are shown in the video in locales around Chiyoda, such {{as a high school}} boy and girl and an office worker, who are later shown dancing with the girl. Near the end of the video, many more people join in to dance, and the outlined illustrations of Clara and Alice are filled out to no longer appear as outlines.|$|R
50|$|The {{music video}} {{features}} only the band. Cameras {{revolve around the}} band playing their parts in a rehearsal setting. When the horn part is prominent, it <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> different <b>shot</b> of the band - wearing hats, sunglasses, and jackets to conceal their identity - playing the trumpet, saxophone and trombone.|$|R
50|$|The scene then <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> wider <b>shot</b> of Hell, showing Pinhead {{standing}} on a platform, surrounded by an even larger sea of bodies. The shot flickers in and out, each time zooming further out and finally fading to Hellraiser: Origins and showing the web address for the projects page.|$|R
5000|$|A {{music video}} was {{produced}} {{for the song}} that begins with the original version and transitions into the Trackmasters Remix version. It begins with <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> of Ryan Toby and Robbie Pardlo on a computer that shows the words [...] "Dream Girl 2001". It then <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> of Ortiz singing the first verse, and then the trio is dancing at a party as Ortiz sings. The video continues switching from Ortiz singing on a couch, the trio at the party, and Ortiz boxing Zab Judah. As the third verse, the first not sung by Ortiz, begins, it features the guys in a car. The video switches <b>to</b> Eve on <b>a</b> motorcycle and starting her rap. The video ends with Toby and Pardlo still {{in front of the}} computer, watching the video.|$|R
50|$|The video {{begins with}} Barlow {{sitting in his}} car, {{watching}} as rain pours down outside. The scene then <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> of Barlow performing inside a social club, where dancers and backing vocalists are performing around him. After the first chorus, the video <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> Barlow walking along a highway, through an underground train station and arriving at the club where he is performing. However, this time, the scene alternates, as he throws his jacket to the ground, moves into {{the centre of the}} stage and performs directly to camera. The video finishes with Barlow returning to his car, realising that the hope he has been searching for is inside of him, which is indicated by the image in his rearside mirror. The music video uses the Rose & Foster mix.|$|R
5|$|The video then <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> of {{the band}} playing the game before {{returning}} to the map screen as 'Docks' or 'Stage 02' flashes. The second level begins {{in much the same way}} as the first with the two characters shooting zombies who appear from the right. The villain again stands in front of the players, laughing before disappearing. A boat/submarine then enters from the right and begins firing bombs at the players who destroy it with laser beams. Another cut scene follows in which the crippled boat returns <b>to</b> <b>a</b> hangar in the sea with 'Evil' written above the entrance. The hangar explodes and disappears before flying out of the water, now with mechanical claws attached, and the video returns again to live action footage of the Super Furries playing the game.|$|R
5000|$|The show's opening sequence, {{directed}} by filmmaker Spike Lee, features Fallon visiting various New York City landmarks, including Grand Central Terminal and Katz's Delicatessen. Steve Higgins introduces {{the show with}} [...] "From Studio 6B in Rockefeller Center, {{in the heart of}} New York City, it's The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon!" [...] and announces that night's guests and [...] "the legendary Roots crew". The show's theme song is [...] "energetic with jazzy overtones" [...] with [...] "Hey Jimmy", designed to match the shots of the city. Just before Higgins introduces Fallon, the camera <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> of The Roots, and Questlove shouts the numbers symbolizing the episode number of The Tonight Show. Higgins then introduces Fallon with a drawn-out [...] "And now, here's your host/here he is, Jimmy Fallon!", and Fallon begins his brief monologue.|$|R
5000|$|The {{music video}} {{is set in}} a club with people dancing whilst the singer sings {{in the middle of the}} dance floor. It shows clips of a couple running away and later kissing passionately. The video was {{uploaded}} onto YouTube on 5 September 2008, when it was uploaded onto Hard2Beat's official channel. The main video has received more than 11 million views as of March 2016. In the video Sash! is playing and can be seen in the background, there is also shots of Stunt's singer, Molly Smitten-Downes singing in the club when it is empty and others of her sat on a bench. When the words [...] "Encore Une Fois" [...] are first heard the camera <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> of <b>a</b> woman's cleavage, this was seen as inappropriate by some viewers and the shot was cut out from some music channels.|$|R
5000|$|In the Seasons 4 and 5 opening {{title and}} credits, {{the first half}} up to the cast credits is {{in much the same}} style as Season 3, with the {{exceptions}} {{of the fact that there}} are no more children among the cast (only Day, Dehner and Joseph are credited among the cast in the opening) and the cable car and hopping montage moved before the cast credits. The end of the opening, following the cast credits, features Doris in a fashion show, modeling different clothes. In the final episodes of Season Five, however, the credit montage changes. Instead of Day wearing the yellow pantsuit shown in the Seasons 3 and 4 openers, she wears a black frilled gown as she descends the staircase. This <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> of her from the Season Five fashion show in which she wears a tan coat and holds a bouquet of purple flowers.|$|R
5000|$|Near {{the end of}} the book, Moss's widow {{returns home}} to find Chigurh inside, waiting for her. After hearing her pleas for mercy, he {{partially}} relents by relying on his coin toss. In the book, she calls heads; it comes up tails, and he shoots and kills her. In the film adaptation, she refuses to call the toss, saying [...] "The coin don't have no say. It's just you." [...] The movie then <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> of Chigurh leaving the house, checking the soles of his boots, implying that he has killed her. While driving away from her house some three blocks away, Chigurh is badly injured in a car accident, sustaining a compound fracture of his left ulna and walking away with a limp. At the collision scene, before the authorities arrive, he offers $100 <b>to</b> <b>a</b> teenager on <b>a</b> bicycle <b>to</b> give him his shirt, seeking to use it to bind up his wounds himself. Chigurh then flees the scene before the ambulance arrives.|$|R
500|$|The third chorus {{features}} similar footage to {{the first}} two—a singer walking down a set of stairs. The two military leaders are then seen appearing on a game show, each pressing a buzzer which makes {{an image of a}} skull behind them light up. The video <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> of <b>a</b> baby sitting between two nuclear missiles before a zoomed out model of the Earth shows multiple mushroom clouds as the planet explodes (this image was used as the front cover for Digipak CD version of the single). The final shot sees the two opposing commanders holding hands and kissing on a tiny piece of the earth as it floats through space while a red heart lights up behind them. The Numero 6 video appears on the DVD release of the band's greatest hits album [...] and the DVD version of the [...] "It's Not the End of the World?" [...] single.|$|R
50|$|As {{the second}} verse begins, Misia is shown from the side, {{sitting on the}} edge of a sofa. <b>As</b> she begins <b>to</b> sing, she turns around <b>to</b> face <b>a</b> window. <b>Shots</b> of Misia driving a car and resting in it are intercut with shots of the scenery. The camera then fades back <b>to</b> <b>a</b> sitting Misia. This is {{followed}} by more scenery <b>shots,</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> of <b>a</b> café-like environment, and one of Misia leaning against a stone wall. Misia is shown gazing out of a window, singing the second chorus while different shots are intercut. She is then seen walking toward a lighthouse. As the bridge comes <b>to</b> <b>an</b> end, the camera fades <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> of the singer walking on a dock in her wedding dress. The camera <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> of Misia dressed in black and playing the piano while singing. The final chorus begins and several shots of Misia singing are repeated. The video ends with <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> of Misia reposing her chin on her hand and staring out of the window of a train as her name and the song's title appear in white font.|$|R
