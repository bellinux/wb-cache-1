The transit formality requires exporters to preform <b>custom</b> <b>declaration</b> in the local custom and to do a custom transit in the port of departure. Such procedures aim to keep the export goods under custom control. Although custom transit indeed safeguards the goods on the way, it actually complicates the custom clearance formalities and increases the transaction cost of the international trade. Therefore, simplifying custom transit procedures could bring benefits to China export business, which contributes to approximately 12...|$|E
40|$|This paper empirically evaluates {{container}} terminal service attributes from shipping lines and shipping agencies’ perspective. Some methods are applied for study, such as Internal-Consistency Reliability, Factor Analysis, Cluster Analysis, Importance-Satisfaction Analysis {{and analysis of}} variance. The results suggest that customers perceive reliability of the agreed vessel sailing time {{to be the most}} important {{container terminal}} service attribute, followed by <b>custom</b> <b>declaration</b> efficiency, loading and discharging efficiency, port cost and berth availability. While quality of port facility is the most satisfactory service attribute. Based on the concept of market segmentation, we employed cluster analysis to classify customers of container terminal into three segments, namely port cost oriented firms, port facilities and equipments oriented firms, and service efficiency and IT service oriented firms. Theoretical and practical implications of the research findings are discussed...|$|E

There are two mechanisms that use in cash courier, declaration system and disclosure system. In some countries, which are using <b>custom</b> <b>declaration</b> as its mechanism will lie on the honesty of person. The mechanism of treating cash courier in money laundering and considering whether it is an administrative violation, or a criminal violation, or a civil violation will be important to be criticized. It should be reconsidered that cash courier in money laundering is a crime, thus should not put it as merely an administrative scope of violation. The administrative sanction would not be proper to handle it. The problem of cash courier would not be a simple problem to be solved. It needs ideal concept and framework to be constructed which is based on objective methods for what law can do to handle, and further will assist to prevent and eradicate money laundering. This qualitative research paper that follows content analysis method provides better insight into cash courier in money laundering and the role to be ensured in detecting mechanisms...|$|E

Mainly about the status of transition from the paper declaration to the electronic paperless <b>customs</b> <b>declaration,</b> not only in the Czech Republic but throughout the European Union. Assessment data is carried out primarily for the period between the years 2012 to 2014, in some cases, for better assessments, in the period between the years 2009 to 2014. The thesis is focused on the evaluation of the situation with modernisation the customs clearance in the Czech Republic and comparing the results between chosen EU member states and the Czech Republic. The usage of the electronic Entry Summary Declarations and Exit Summary Declarations have increased several times in last two years. Implementation of systems for lodgement and processing of <b>customs</b> <b>declarations</b> for more effective and efficient control of goods within the EU member states has also very fast growing trend with very low error rate. The rate of electronically lodged <b>customs</b> <b>declarations</b> is reaching in most of the EU member states almost 100 %.

This is {{significantly different from the}} EDI developments in the western countries in which private sector involvement in EDI is substantial (UNESCAP, 1996). As an initial step to spur EDI implementation in private sector, the Malaysian Government has imposed all companies that engage in international trade to implement EDI by doing electronic <b>customs</b> <b>declarations</b> through CIS (<b>Customs</b> Information System) DagangNet. For this, the Government also spent over RM 300 million to fully implement EDI nationwide (Star, 2003 December 3). Nevertheless, such implementation is not successful and it has been claimed that “EDI is not yet fully implemented even though it had been initiated since late 1990 s, besides electronic data is also still not recognized for legal <b>customs</b> <b>declaration</b> purposes even if it was meant for paperless and electronic customs declarations” (Star, 2003 December 3). To date, there are dual <b>customs</b> <b>declarations,</b> both electronic and manual, in practices where the sole typical electronic transaction is registration of the customs form (Jimmy, 2005; Star, 2005 July 11). This is in contrast with electronic <b>customs</b> <b>declarations</b> by other countries such as Hong Kong, Korea and Singapore where there is a full electronic declaration including electronic payment for declarations charges (Jimmy, 2005; Star, 2005 July 11; Chau, 2001) ...|$|R
