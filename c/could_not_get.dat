5|$|Goebbels, however, wanted more, {{and he saw}} in Wessel's {{shooting}} {{the possibility of a}} propaganda bonanza. The beginning of his plan was to turn Wessel's funeral into a mass demonstration full of speeches and processions of SA men in uniform, but he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> the necessary police permits to do so, even after Wessel's sister requested Hindenburg to relent.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} over 57 days in New York and Paris between October and December 2005. The film's budget was $41 million. It was originally lower, which caused problems with some locations—the crew <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> permission to shoot at the Museum of Modern Art or Bryant Park.|$|E

5|$|The first cyclist {{to cross}} the finish line {{received}} 1 point. Other cyclists received one point more than the cyclist who passed the line directly before him, plus an additional point for every five minutes between them, with a maximum of ten points. In this way, a cyclist <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> more than 11 points more than the cyclist that crossed the finish line just before him.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of his work with Queen in June 1991, Mercury retired {{to his home in}} Kensington, west London. His former partner, Mary Austin, had been a particular comfort in his final years, and {{in the last few weeks}} of his life made regular visits to his home to look after him. Near the end of his life Mercury was starting to lose his sight, and he deteriorated to the point where he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> out of bed. Due to his worsening condition, Mercury decided to hasten his death by refusing to take his medication and continued taking only painkillers.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{married a}} schoolteacher, Alison Margaret Edward on 11 June 1942. Alison was the {{daughter}} of Kenneth Edward, a Scottish Professor of Theology at the University of Sydney. The couple met at a country dance, when Barnes, on his way back from an exhibition match in Katoomba, was bet the price of the meal that he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> the young girl to dance with him. Within twelve months the pair were married.|$|E

5|$|Fairfax {{wrote that}} his second-in-command, Major-General Lambert, <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> up to him, and so charged in another place. A lane, the present-day Atterwith Lane, crossed the ditch on this flank, and some {{accounts}} suggest that several units were easy {{targets for the}} Royalist musketeers as they advanced along the lane only four abreast. When a small embankment alongside the ditch at this point was removed in the 1960s, several hundred musket balls were recovered.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{his time}} as housing {{secretary}} was considered unsuccessful. However, although he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> federal funding for empowerment zones passed during his tenure, by 1992 38 states had created empowerment zones, and in 1994 $3.5billion was approved for them under President Clinton. A free market Kemp initiative to allow homeowners to subdivide their houses {{for the purpose of}} creating rental units without inordinate bureaucracy did not get executed under the Clinton administration, however. In 1992, with H. Ross Perot mounting a formidable campaign, Kemp was again considered a Vice Presidential candidate.|$|E
5|$|He spent 1976 to 1978 at Hull City, {{before being}} {{appointed}} player-manager at Doncaster Rovers in November 1978. He {{spent seven years}} at the helm, guiding the club to promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1980–81 and 1983–84, before he took on the manager's job at Leeds United in October 1985. He <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> the club promoted back into the top-flight and left the club in September 1988. He returned to Doncaster in July 1989, ending his second spell in charge in November 1991.|$|E

5|$|In May 1942, the Australian {{government}} appointed Air Vice Marshal George Jones as Chief of the Air Staff. He became {{responsible for}} matters other than operations, such as administration and training. It {{soon became clear}} that Jones and Bostock <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> along together, but Kenney preferred to have Bostock in operational command, and although he regarded the antipathy between Jones and Bostock as a nuisance, was happy to leave arrangements the way they were.|$|E
5|$|Leigh-Mallory {{claimed the}} Big Wings had {{destroyed}} entire formations of enemy aircraft upon seeing them. He even claimed the RAF outnumbered their opponents in several engagements. In the afternoon battle, {{he claimed that}} the Wing <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> into position {{to break up the}} bombers in time and was intercepted by German fighters. Still, while that was true he also claimed his units had shot down 105 enemy aircraft and probably destroyed a further 40. He claimed another 18 damaged for the loss of 14 and six pilots.|$|E
5|$|Of all the {{responsibilities}} given the two ships, {{the most important}} was to guard the Eastern Mediterranean against a breakout by Goeben, but when Goeben and Breslau finally made their breakout attempt on 20 January 1918, Lord Nelson was away at Salonika and Agamemnon <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> steam up to depart Mudros in time {{to participate in the}} resulting Battle of Imbros. After both German ships struck mines, Breslau sank and Goeben returned to the Dardanelles before Agamemnon could arrive on the scene.|$|E

5|$|On 24 January 2009, Ofcom allowed {{electrical}} {{retailers to}} be granted a licence to rebroadcast DAB signals within their stores to demonstrate DAB radio sets within their stores. The United Kingdom consumer charity, Which? warned that consumers who <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> an adequate DAB signal could be misled by the in-store sets. The Digital Radio Development Bureau replied to the Which? report stating that stores contain a steel structure which produce a faraday cage effect where DAB signals are blocked out. The DRDB recommended that consumers should check DAB coverage online with their postcode before purchasing a DAB radio to avoid disappointment.|$|E
5|$|The {{belief that}} certain animals cannot rise if pushed over has {{historical}} antecedents, though cattle {{have never been}} so classified. Julius Caesar recorded a belief that a European elk (moose) had no knee joints and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> up if it fell. Pliny said the same about the hind legs of an animal he called the achlis, which Pliny's 19th-century translators Bostock and Riley said was merely {{another name for the}} elk. They also noted that Pliny's belief about the jointless back legs of the achlis (elk) was false.|$|E
5|$|The cook {{let go of}} the line. We rowed {{around to}} see if we <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> a line from the chief engineer, and all this time, mind you, there were no shrieks, no groans, but silence, silence and silence, and then the Commodore sank. She lurched to windward, then swung afar back, righted and dove into the sea, and the rafts were {{suddenly}} swallowed by this frightful maw of the ocean. And then by the men on the ten-foot dingy were words said that were still not words—something far beyond words.|$|E

5|$|The next day, {{the rebels}} {{returned}} to Bower Hill. Their force had swelled to nearly 600 men, now commanded by Major James McFarlane, {{a veteran of}} the Revolutionary War. Neville had also received reinforcements: 10 U.S. Army soldiers from Pittsburgh under the command of Major Abraham Kirkpatrick, Neville's brother-in-law. Before the rebel force arrived, Kirkpatrick had Neville leave the house and hide in a nearby ravine. David Lenox and General Neville's son Presley Neville also returned to the area, though they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> into the house and were captured by the rebels.|$|E
5|$|The {{nurse was}} due to arrive at 9:00 the morning of February 11, 1963, to help Plath with the care of her children. Upon arrival, she <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> into the flat, but {{eventually}} gained access {{with the help of}} a workman, Charles Langridge. They found Plath dead of carbonmonoxide poisoning with her head in the oven, having sealed the rooms between her and her sleeping children with tape, towels and cloths. At approximately 4:30am, Plath had placed her head in the oven, with the gas turned on. She was 30years old.|$|E
5|$|The song {{at the end}} of the show, {{written by}} Ken Keeler, is a parody of various Bond themes. Keeler {{originally}} wrote it to be three seconds longer and sound more like the Goldfinger theme, but the final version was shorter and the lyrics were sped up. The writers wanted the song to be sung by Shirley Bassey, who sang several Bond themes, but they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> her to record the part.|$|E
50|$|Pressures from {{qualified}} {{students from}} each state who <b>could</b> <b>not</b> readily <b>get</b> admissions {{to any of}} the Federal Universities continued to mount on States Governments.
