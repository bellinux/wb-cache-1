5|$|False flax oil made of {{the seeds}} of <b>Camelina</b> sativa. One of the {{earliest}} oil crops, {{dating back to the}} 6th millennium B.C. Produced in modern times in Central and Eastern Europe; fell out of production in the 1940s. Considered promising as a food or fuel oil.|$|E
5|$|In August 2008, an unmodified F-22 of the 411th Flight Test Squadron {{performed}} in the first ever air-to-air refueling of an aircraft using synthetic jet fuel {{as part of a}} wider USAF effort to qualify aircraft to use the fuel, a 50/50 mix of JP-8 and a Fischer–Tropsch process-produced, natural gas-based fuel. In 2011, an F-22 flew supersonic on a 50% mixture of biofuel derived from <b>camelina.</b>|$|E

50|$|Poebrotherium {{lies within}} the clade Camelidae, {{which can be}} defined as (Stenomylinae + (Miolabinae + (Protolabinae + <b>Camelinae)))</b> + Poebrotherium. As such, Poebrotherium lies outside the <b>Camelinae</b> proper. In fact the {{definition}} of Camelidae is the most recent common ancestor of Poebrotherium and Camelus, and all of its descendants.|$|R
50|$|Camelini {{was named}} by Gray (1821). It was {{assigned}} to <b>Camelinae</b> by Stanley et al. (1994).|$|R
25|$|Non-food crops like <b>Camelina,</b> Jatropha, {{seashore}} mallow and mustard, {{used for}} biodiesel, can thrive on {{marginal agricultural land}} where many trees and crops won't grow, or would produce only slow growth yields. <b>Camelina</b> is virtually 100 percent efficient. It can be harvested and crushed for oil and the remaining parts {{can be used to}} produce high quality omega-3 rich animal feed, fiberboard, and glycerin. <b>Camelina</b> does not take away from land currently being utilized for food production. Most <b>camelina</b> acres are grown in areas that were previously not utilized for farming. For example, areas that receive limited rainfall that can not sustain corn or soybeans without the addition of irrigation can grow <b>camelina</b> and add to their profitability.|$|E
25|$|Some GM {{soybeans}} offer improved oil profiles {{for processing}} or healthier eating. <b>Camelina</b> sativa has been modified to produce plants that accumulate {{high levels of}} oils similar to fish oils.|$|E
25|$|The {{stomach and}} {{intestines}} were examined and tests {{carried out on}} their contents. Scientists identified the man's last meal as porridge or gruel made from grains and seeds, both cultivated and wild. Approximately 40 kinds of seeds were identified, but the porridge was primarily composed of four types: barley, flax, false flax (<b>Camelina</b> sativa) and knotgrass. From the stage of digestion {{it was concluded that}} the man had eaten 12 to 24 hours prior to his death. Porridges were common for people of this time. Because neither meat nor fresh fruit was found in the last meal, it is suggested that the meal was eaten in winter or early spring when these items were not available.|$|E
50|$|<b>Camelinae</b> {{was named}} by Gray (1821). Its type is Camelus. It was {{assigned}} to Camelidae by Stanley et al. (1994) and Ruez (2005).|$|R

50|$|Lamini (members {{are called}} laminoids) is a tribe of the {{subfamily}} <b>Camelinae.</b> It contains two extant genera with four species, all exclusively from South America: llamas, alpacas, vicuñas, and guanacos. The former two are domesticated species, {{while the latter}} two are only found in the wild. All lack sexual dimorphism. The four species can interbreed and produce fertile offspring. Additionally, there are two extinct genera known from the fossil record.|$|R
2500|$|Genetic {{modifications}} to soybeans {{are already being}} used. [...] Genetic modifications and breeding can increase vegetable oil yields. [...] From 1979 to 2005 the soybean yield in bushels per acre more than doubled. [...] A company has developed a variety of <b>camelina</b> sativa that yields 20% more oil than the standard variety.|$|E
50|$|Approximately 50,000 acres are {{currently}} cultivated in Canada. The <b>Camelina</b> Association of Canada projects Canada estimates that 1 to 3 million acres could be {{planted in the}} future. Several factors challenge the spread of <b>camelina</b> cultivation in Canada: {{it does not have}} government crop classification, and <b>camelina</b> meal is not approved as livestock feed. In early 2010, Health Canada approved <b>camelina</b> oil as a food in Canada.|$|E
50|$|<b>Camelina</b> is a genus {{within the}} {{flowering}} plant family Brassicaceae. The <b>Camelina</b> species, {{commonly known as}} false flax, are native to Mediterranean regions of Europe and Asia. Most species of this genus have been little studied, {{with the exception of}} <b>Camelina</b> sativa, historically cultivated as oil plant. Heinrich Johann Nepomuk von Crantz was the first botanist to use the genus <b>Camelina</b> in his classification works in 1762. As a way to reduce fossil fuel emissions, the US Navy tested a 50-50 mix of jet aviation fuel and biofuel derived from <b>camelina</b> seeds in 2010. A study published in December 2016 explained that the current low price of conventional kerosene-based jet fuel makes it cost-prohibitive for commercial airlines to use camelina-based jet fuel. The study said substantial government intervention would be one way to create a market for <b>camelina,</b> by combining 9 percent government subsidy on <b>camelina</b> crop production, with 9 percent tax on the conventional fuel.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Camelina</b> {{has been}} {{approved}} as a cattle feed supplement in the US, {{as well as an}} ingredient (up to 10% of the ration) in broiler chicken feed and laying hen feed. <b>Camelina</b> meal, the byproduct of <b>camelina</b> when the oil has been extracted, has a significant crude protein content. [...] "Feeding <b>camelina</b> meal significantly increased (p < 0.01) omega-3 acid concentration in both breast and thigh meat turkeys compared to control group." [...] Medical research indicates a diet abundant in omega-3 fatty acids is beneficial to human health. <b>Camelina</b> oil has also been investigated as a sustainable lipid source to fully replace fish oil in diets for farmed Atlantic salmon, rainbow trout, and Atlantic cod. However, various antinutritional factors are present in <b>camelina</b> oil meal and can affect its use as livestock feed.|$|E

50|$|Usually, <b>camelina</b> {{does not}} need any field interventions. However, {{perennial}} weeds {{may be difficult to}} control. Some specialized oilseed herbicides can be used on it. Also, <b>camelina</b> is highly resistant to black leg and Alternaria brassicae, but it can be susceptible to sclerotinia stem rot. No insect has be found to cause economic damage to <b>camelina.</b> <b>Camelina</b> needs little water or nitrogen to flourish; it can be grown on marginal agricultural lands. Fertilization requirements depend on soils, but are generally low. It may be used as a rotation crop for wheat and other cereals, to increase the health of the soil. <b>Camelina</b> can also show some allelopathic traits, and it can be grown in mixed crop with cereals or legumes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Camelina</b> is a short-season crop (85-100 days) {{and grows}} {{well in the}} {{temperate}} climate zone in light or medium soils. <b>Camelina</b> is generally seeded in spring from March to May, but can also be seeded in fall in mild climates.|$|E
50|$|Today, <b>camelina</b> is found, wild or cultivated, {{in almost}} all regions of Europe, Asia, and North America, but also in South America, Australia, and New Zealand. <b>Camelina</b> seems to be {{particularly}} adapted to cold semiarid climate zone (steppes and prairies).|$|E
50|$|In early 2009, Sustainable Oils began field {{research}} operations in Chile.
