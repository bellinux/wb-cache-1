40|$|Dysphagia, often {{associated}} with conditions such as stroke, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and dementia, causes patients to have difficulty with swallowing food and/or liquids. These patients require their fluids to be thickened using gum-based thickening powders {{in order to facilitate}} safe swallowing. These thickened fluids are also used as a vehicle for delivery of crushed medicines. Our in vitro measurements suggest that thickened fluids can delay and reduce the dissolution of a number of medications. This study was conducted {{to assess the impact of}} the use of thickened fluids on the clinical pharmacokinetics of oral paracetamol. METHODS 20 Healthy volunteers were administered a single oral dose (1 g) of paracetamol as either whole tablets, <b>crushed</b> <b>with</b> water, <b>crushed</b> <b>with</b> semi-solid jam, or <b>crushed</b> <b>with</b> thickened fluid according to a randomised, crossover design. Saliva samples were collected periodically over 8 hr and paracetamol concentration analysed by HPLC-UV. Non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted using Winnonlin®. RESULTS The mean peak concentration (Cmax) of paracetamol ranged between 5. 62 – 8. 00 μg/mL. Comparison between the <b>crushed</b> paracetamol <b>with</b> thickened water (Level 900) and other treatment options (whole, <b>crushed</b> <b>with</b> water, and <b>crushed</b> <b>with</b> jam) showed there was a significant difference in Cmax at 90...|$|R
