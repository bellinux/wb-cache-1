The supercritical wing, hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) <b>control</b> <b>principle,</b> and increased engineered [...] stability make the aircraft fundamentally easier to fly. Ed Harper, general manager for the McDonnell Douglas Harrier II development program, summarized: [...] "The AV-8B {{looks a lot like}} the original Harrier and it uses the same operating fundamentals.

It has a wide range of functions, including radar warning information and weapon delivery checklist. The pilots sit on UPC/Stencel 10B zero-zero ejection seats, meaning that they are able to eject from a stationary aircraft at zero altitude.|$|E

40|$|Active {{magnetic}} bearing (AMB) is a bearing type that supports a rotor with a magnetic force without any physical contact. AMBs require continuous control as an AMB-rotor system is unstable. Various <b>control</b> <b>principles</b> {{could be used}} in the AMB-rotor system: feedback control, cascaded control with different inner control loops, and model-based control. In control of electrical motors, the DTC principle and the flux estimation provide very fast control responses by power switches direct control. In AMB control systems the corresponding principle can be adapted for direct control of forces without a need for cascaded control loops. In this thesis, the feedback control and the cascaded control are studied, the direct force <b>control</b> (DFC) <b>principle</b> is designed. The rotor is considered to be rigid and the 2 degree of freedom AMB is studied. The comparison of the <b>control</b> <b>principles</b> responses is analyzed.

Lean production <b>control</b> <b>principles</b> include the levelling of production, the use of pull mechanisms and takt time <b>control.</b> These <b>principles</b> have mainly been applied in high volume flow shop environments where orders move through the production system in one direction in a limited number of identifiable routing sequences. This article investigates how lean production <b>control</b> <b>principles</b> {{can be used in a}} make-to-order job shop, where volume is typically low and there is high variety. We show how production levelling, constant work in process, first in first out and takt time can be integrated in a lean production control system. A case study is presented to illustrate the design and phased implementation of the system in a typical dual resource constrained production environment. The case study demonstrates that lean production <b>control</b> <b>principles</b> can be successfully implemented in a high-variety/low-volume context.

50|$|The {{principle}} of the DFIG is that rotor windings {{are connected to the}} grid via slip rings and back-to-back voltage source converter that controls both the rotor and the grid currents. Thus rotor frequency can freely differ from the grid frequency (50 or 60 Hz). By using the converter to control the rotor currents, it is possible to adjust the active and reactive power fed to the grid from the stator independently of the generator's turning speed. The <b>control</b> <b>principle</b> used is either the two-axis current vector control or direct torque control (DTC). DTC has turned out to have better stability than current vector control especially when high reactive currents are required from the generator.|$|E

50|$|Flux braking {{is another}} method, based on motor losses, for {{handling}} an overrunning load. When braking {{in the drive}} system is needed, the motor flux and thus also the magnetizing current component used in the motor are increased. The control of flux can be easily achieved through the direct torque <b>control</b> <b>principle.</b> With DTC the inverter is directly controlled to achieve the desired torque and flux for the motor. During flux braking the motor is under DTC control which guarantees that braking can be made according to the specified speed ramp. This is very different to the DC injection braking typically used in drives. In the DC injection method DC current is injected to the motor so that control of the motor flux is lost during braking. The flux braking method based on DTC enables the motor to shift quickly from braking to motoring power when requested.|$|E
50|$|Circle-throw {{vibrating}} units rely on {{operating the}} screen component at a resonant frequency to sieve efficiently. While properly selected vibration frequencies drastically improve filtration, a deflection factor occurs as the vibrations displaces smaller particles. They do not properly {{pass through the}} screen due to excess movement. This is a property of the system's natural frequency. The natural frequency preferably vibrates at Fn is 188(1/d)2 (cycles per min) where d = (188/Fn)2 (inches). Static deflection corresponds to this frequency. Vibration isolation is a <b>control</b> <b>principle</b> employed to mitigate transmission. On circle-throw vibrating screens, passive vibration isolation {{in the form of}} mechanical springs and suspension are employed {{at the base of the}} unit, which provides stability and control of motor vibration. A rule of thumb regarding the amount of static deflection minimization that should be targeted with respect to operating RPM is provided in the table below.|$|E
40|$|Role-based {{access control}} (RBAC) has been {{introduced}} {{in the last few}} years, and offers a powerful means of specifying access control decisions. The model of RBAC usually assumes that, if there is a role hierarchy, then access rights are inherited upwards through the hierarchy. This paper examines the relationship between the inheritance properties of role hierarchies and <b>control</b> <b>principles</b> which are used in many large organisations: separation of duties; delegation; and supervision and review. It discusses possible relationships between roles and identifies three different kinds of role hierarchy. The <b>control</b> <b>principles</b> and role hierarchies are illustrated in a realistic application, and their interactions are discussed. It emerges that there may be conflict between <b>control</b> <b>principles</b> and the inheritance of access rights through a role hierarchy.

A triplex, digital fly-by-wire system is employed on the Gripen's {{flight controls}}, with a mechanical backup for the throttle. Additional functions, such as communications, navigational and decision support data, can be accessed via the up front control panel, directly above the central cockpit display. The Gripen includes the EP-17 cockpit display system, developed by Saab to provide pilots {{with a high level}} of situational awareness and reduces pilot workload through intelligent information management. The Gripen features a sensor fusion capability, information from onboard sensors and databases is combined, automatically analysed, and useful data is presented to the pilot via a wide field-of-view head-up display, three large multi-function colour displays, and optionally a helmet mounted display system (HMDS).|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the first}} major RV Fridge control changes {{occurred}} when the Absorption Refrigeration Protective RV (ARPrv) Controller was invented. The ARPrv <b>control</b> <b>principle</b> of operation {{is based on the}} same physics that result in a constant temperature for the boiling of water. The ARP Control simply measures the latent heat of vaporization of ammonia. The ARP detects when Q2 is not flowing by the rise in temperature due to ammonia not being returned to the boiler. When ammonia does not return to the boiler, the sodium chromate [...] is destroyed by excess heat. Once the sodium chromate is destroyed, intergranular corrosion, which leads to stress corrosion cracking, will eventually result in a cooling unit rupture. This discovery has solved most of the operator error issues such as off-level operation of the fridge. The ARPrv controller is a proactive automatic boiler control that limits both thermal stress on the boiler and stress on the working fluids. In addition, by limiting the temperature at the boiler, the pressure in the cooling unit is controlled which in turn increases safety and longevity of the RV Fridge.|$|E
