50|$|The Middle Palaeolithic period (ca. 250,000-48,000) is {{represented}} in the Levant by the Mousterian culture, known from numerous sites (both caves and open-air sites) through the region. The <b>chronological</b> <b>subdivision</b> of the Mousterian {{is based on the}} stratigraphic sequence of the Tabun Cave. Middle Paleolithic human remains include both the Neanderthals (in Kebara Cave, Amud Cave and Tabun), and anatomically modern humans (AMH) from Jebel Qafzeh and Skhul Cave.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investi-gate how archaeological fish remains and written historical records can contribute to the reconstruction of long-term developments of fish communities along the Austrian and Hungarian Danube. Although such approaches are sensi-tive to various factors, the <b>chronological</b> <b>subdivision</b> and relative quantification of proxy data demonstrate environ-mental and faunal changes from Prehistory onwards. Intensification of fisheries, decline of large specimens and massive exploitation of small and young fish point to increasing pressure along the chronological sequence to-wards Early Modern times. One result of this impact was the establishment of regulations and laws to protect such fish. At the same time, the rise of aquaculture and common carp cultivation can be viewed as another upshot of human impact on the Danube’s environment. Finally, the massive import of salted marine fish reflects a compensation for the undersupply caused by overexploitation of the Danube fish fauna and points to the growing demand for fish as food in late medieval and Early Modern times...|$|E
40|$|Literature on genre {{analysis}} mainly {{focuses on}} the description of language use in the different professional and institutional domains (Bhatia 2004). Despite the different directions of the studies on genre (Bhatia 1993; Martin and Christie 1997; Swales 1990), a common orientation {{may be seen in}} their tendency to describe homogeneous concepts, such as communicative situation, register and function. Nevertheless, genre-specific features are subject to changes due to the ongoing processes of internationalisation and globalisation (Candlin and Gotti 2004; Cortese and Duszak 2005; Crystal 1997). In particular, political and institutional communication genres have been experiencing in-depth transformation in the last few decades, mainly due to evolutions in the media market, fuelled by technological developments and by the economic globalisation (Blumler and Kavanagh 1999). This paper looks in particular at the stance clusters or, to put it differently, it deals with the speaker-positioning phrases in the discourse structure of White House press briefings. The data come from a monolingual corpus which includes all the Press briefings across three presidencies (January 1993 – October 2010). The addition of XML mark-up to the whole corpus, including information about individual speakers and their role, as well as providing a <b>chronological</b> <b>subdivision</b> within the corpus, allows us to compare different discourse strategies adopted by different speakers in the briefings at different points in time. This leads us {{to determine the extent of}} the differences in the patterns found as well as the nature of the variation from one podium to the next one and to establish if these patterns are semantically primed (Hoey 2005). The perspective of the analysis is phraseological in that, as Hopper argues (1987 : 150), linguistic form, often in prefabricated chunks, is shaped by discourse use. The analysis relies on two pieces of software: Wordsmith Tools (Scott 2007) to retrieve the clusters and Xaira to study their distribution across the years. What we aim to demonstrate from a methodological point of view is that clusters, which are here categorized according to functional criteria (see Mahlberg 2007), can be revealing for identifying specificity of this particular genre and the changes stance clusters in particular are experiencing from Clinton to Obama...|$|E
25|$|Special {{emphasis}} is placed on documenting the concrete types of contact which are observed in the ground. This is done with great detail at the level of each individual feature. From this evidence is automatically derived a complete depositional history of all elements in contact. The strata are conceived as segments of this continuum in which a single depositional moment can be reconstructed. The phases are periods that are culturally identifiable on the basis of typological and functional analysis. Horizons are the broad <b>chronological</b> <b>subdivisions</b> based on comparative material and as they can be linked to the general historical understanding.|$|R
40|$|This {{series of}} volumes {{provides}} access to a compendium {{of the best and}} most significant scholarship published on European performance practice over the last half century or so. The featured articles and book chapters provide a comprehensive introduction to many of the major past and current developments in the field, emphasizing acting, performance spaces, staging and audiences, from the Middle Ages to the present day. Each of the four volumes covers a specific period: these, with inevitable overlaps dictated by geographical and other concerns, are 1400 – 1580, 1580 – 1750, 1750 – 1900 and 1900 to the present. The volume editors have selected those publications that most usefully represent performance practice within their own specialist period. The strong focus on British theatre is complemented by European material and references. The timeframe spanned by the four volumes witnessed striking changes in definitions of the term ‘performance’. The editors of the first and fourth volumes confront this challenge from different perspectives. Philip Butterworth and Katie Normington remind us that the term ‘performance’ was not used in conjunction with what we now define as ‘theatrical performance’ prior to 1580. For the purpose of considering medieval performance they insist that the term must encompass: "the conscious and deliberate organization, execution, perception and reception of theatre and its aftermath to people who choose to witness and participate in it. This involves indoor and outdoor performance – both formal and informal, theatre of the streets and the deliberate organization and construction of stage and spectator space. " By the twentieth century, as Nadine Holdsworth and Geoff Willcocks demonstrate, with reference to Richard Schechner, ‘the very term “performance” has taken on multiple meanings and infiltrated numerous disciplines within the arts and humanities’, whether through Goffman’s work on performance in everyday life or Butler’s on the performance of gendered identity. Thus their task is not so much to define performance as to limit definition to a focus on: "Performance … that is, in some sense, theatrical in that it has been created with an audience in mind, whether that audience is deliberately party to the transaction through the act of purchasing a ticket or turning up at an allotted time or inadvertent as with works such as happenings or street theatre that address both a knowing and unknowing audience in its broadest sense. " While performance practice, especially {{at the beginning and end}} of our period, is not necessarily confined within purpose built spaces, theatre buildings and the performances they engendered, through their impact on acting, design, technology and audiences, figure in many of the extracts anthologized in these four volumes. Each volume has been compiled with an awareness of the historiographical background to the study of theatre practices in different periods. Butterworth and Normington provide a useful account of the development of scholarship on medieval theatre prior to the twentieth century and more recently through the work of Chambers, Wickham, Kolve, Meredith and Twycross, showing how the REED project has provided greatly enhanced resources for a new generation of medieval scholars, enabling them to examine medieval performance practices more closely. In response to these advances, the first volume provides a cross-section of performance documents as well as critical discussion. In Volume II, Robert Henke and M. A. Katritzky provide a rich insight into the influence of the Renaissance on European theatre practices and the convergences and development of different practices, organizing their materials under Gurr’s ‘four estates’ of theatre: playing spaces, staging, actors and audiences. The impact of space on performance – on acting, setting, design and dramaturgy – is closely considered, while notions of acting ‘character’ and acting the ‘passions’ are also examined. Audiences become increasingly more diverse and complex during this period, a theme followed up by Jim Davis in Volume III, which covers a period of greatly expanding audience demand for professional theatre, in both its popular and its high cultural manifestations. Larger theatres, new technologies, advances in scene design and lighting, the cult of the celebrity actor, as well as debates about the nature of acting itself, are among the many factors that influenced European performance during the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The rise of the director towards the end of the nineteenth century gathers momentum in the twentieth century, when many directors and practitioners demonstrate a pan-European range of new approaches to theatrical practice, covered in Volume IV. Holdsworth and Willcocks are also mindful of the strong focus on the social and political dimensions of performance during this period, the notion of spectator as witness and the extraordinary cross-fertilization of performance practices throughout Europe. The chosen <b>chronological</b> <b>subdivision,</b> just one of many ways in which these four volumes could have been organized, reflects a widespread approach in performance practice studies. The editors have worked from the premise that each volume has its own idiosyncratic voice, most appropriate to the period under consideration, while maintaining a focus on performance practices as they have developed and varied across time and space. This selection offers the reader a compact and reliable introduction to the vast range of publications generated by scholarship in this field and provides reference pointers for further study. We trust that this representative cross-section of articles, book chapters and records will serve as an invaluable resource for those wishing to study, teach or recreate aspects of the many and varied facets of performance practice in Europe from medieval times up until the present day. ...|$|E
