25|$|Korf co-founded Mycotaxon, an {{international}} peer-reviewed journal of taxonomy and nomenclature of fungi and lichens, with co-worker Grégoire L. Hennebert in 1974. Korf and Hennebert were frustrated that papers submitted to journals such as Mycologia {{took a year}} or longer from submission to publication. Korf and Hennebert introduced a number of innovations to make their journal more efficient and accessible than its contemporaries. Mycotaxon reduced the wait time between submission and publication by requiring authors to submit <b>camera-ready</b> <b>copy.</b> Linotype was the industry standard at the time; Mycotaxon used photo-offset lithography to expedite publication. A quarterly journal, Mycotaxon aimed to publish papers within four months of submission. Mycotaxon took an unusual non-blind approach to refereeing: authors were required to enlist a reviewer outside of their institution to peer-review their manuscript prior to its submission. Initially Mycotaxon did not demand page charges from authors, rather relying on subscription fees to finance publication. Papers of all lengths were accepted.|$|E

5000|$|The {{boom in the}} {{underground}} press was made practical by the availability of cheap offset printing, which {{made it possible to}} print a few thousand copies of a small tabloid paper for a couple of hundred dollars, which a sympathetic printer might extend on credit. Paper was cheap, and many printing firms around the country had over-expanded during the 1950s and had excess capacity on their offset web presses, which could be negotiated for at bargain rates. [...] Most papers operated on a shoestring budget, pasting up <b>camera-ready</b> <b>copy</b> on layout sheets on the editor's kitchen table, with labor performed by unpaid, non-union volunteers. Typesetting costs, which at the time were wiping out many established big city papers, were avoided by typing up copy on a rented or borrowed IBM Selectric typewriter to be pasted up by hand. As one observer commented with only slight hyperbole, students were financing the publication of these papers out of their lunch money.|$|E
50|$|The editors {{tried to}} ensure that the {{dictionary}} entries did not infringe on the Hopis' sense of religious propriety: for example, they did not give detailed translations of the meanings of the names of different Kachinas. They also carefully considered the format in which the linguistic data should be represented, in order to best facilitate its use among both native speakers and scholars. To assure community support and involvement, Sekaquaptewa set up a board of Hopi elders who volunteered {{to take part in the}} dictionary compilation process in order to help the survival of the Hopi language. While the copyright was retained for the University of Arizona, it was arranged so that all royalties from the book were to go to the Hopi Foundation, a charitable foundation devoted to improve Hopi education. A preliminary presentation of the Project in 1991 also received a favourable response from parts of the Hopi community.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the series is to make {{available}} to specialists and the interested public the results of research that, because of its unconventional or controversial nature, might otherwise go unpublished. The editor actively encourages younger, not yet well established, scholars and independent authors to submit manuscripts for consideration. Contributions {{in any of the}} major scholarly languages of the world, including Romanized Modern Standard Mandarin (MSM) and Japanese, are acceptable. In special circumstances, papers written in one of the Sinitic topolects (fangyan) may be considered for publication. Although the chief focus of Sino-Platonic Papers is on the intercultural relations of China with other peoples, challenging and creative studies {{on a wide variety of}} philological subjects will be entertained. This series is not the place for safe, sober, and stodgy presentations. Sino-Platonic Papers prefers lively work that, while taking reasonable risks to advance the field, capitalizes on brilliant new insights into the development of civilization. The only style-sheet we honor is that of consistency. Where possible, we prefer the usages of the Journal of Asian Studies. Sinographs (hanzi, also called tetragraphs [fangkuaizi]) and other unusual symbols should be kept to an absolute minimum. Sino-Platonic Papers emphasizes substance over form. Submissions are regularly sent out to be refereed and extensive editorial suggestions for revision may be offered. Manuscripts should be double-spaced with wide margins and submitted in duplicate. A set of "Instructions for Authors" may be obtained by contacting the editor. Ideally, the final draft should be a neat, clear <b>camera-ready</b> <b>copy</b> with high blackand-white contrast.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{scalable}} method for forward stochastic reachability analysis for uncontrolled linear systems with affine disturbance. Our method uses Fourier transforms to efficiently compute the forward stochastic reach probability measure (density) and the forward stochastic reach set. This method is applicable to systems with bounded or unbounded disturbance sets. We also examine the convexity {{properties of the}} forward stochastic reach set and its probability density. Motivated by the problem of a robot attempting to capture a stochastically moving, non-adversarial target, we demonstrate our method on two simple examples. Where traditional approaches provide approximations, our method provides exact analytical expressions for the densities and probability of capture.
