In the experiments, two types of dried sewage sludge were tested and their properties were analysed. Parameters such as air ratio λ = 0. 12 to 0. 27, gasification agent temperature t = 50 to 250 °C and gasification agent composition ( = 0. 21 and  > 0. 21) were found to influence on temperature distribution, syngas Lower Heating Value (LHV) and syngas composition. The {{results indicate that the}} syngas LHV was found to decrease with increased air ratio for all analyzed cases: cold and preheated air and <b>cold</b> <b>enriched</b> air. The increase in the percentage of the main combustible components was accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of carbon dioxide. Increasing oxygen concentration increased the temperature, which tended to favor the formation of smaller molecules in the gas mixture. Thus, the enriched air medium produced a gas with a higher LHV. In contrast to conventional gasification, gasification process with gasification agent preheating causes that the flux of heat necessary to support endothermic gasification reactions is producing more effective. Air preheating causes increases hydrogen and carbon monoxide production...|$|R

With increasing population pressure, the forest cover {{of the country is}} deteriorating at an alarming rate. Along with various factors, forest fires are a major cause of degradation of Indian forests. According to a Forest Survey of India report, about 50 per cent of forest areas in the country are prone to fire. It is estimated that the proportion of forest areas prone to forest fires annually ranges from 33 % in some states to over 90 % in others. While statistical data and geospatial information on forest fire are very weak or even not available. About 90 % of the forest fires in India are started by humans. The degree of forest fire risk analysis and frequency of fire incidents are very important factors for taking preventive measures and post fire degradation assessment. Geospatial techniques are proving to be powerful tools to assess the forest fire risk and degradation assessment.

40|$|Mixing {{processes}} in stars driven by composition gradients {{as a result}} of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability are not anticipated. They are supported only by hydrodynamic studies of stellar convection. We find that such mixing occurs below the bottom edge of convection zones in our multidimensional hydrodynamic shell convection models. It operates at interfaces created by off-center nuclear burning, where less dense gas with higher mean molecular weight is located above denser gas with a lower mean molecular weight. We discuss the mixing under various conditions with hydrodynamic convection models based on stellar evolutionary calculations of the core helium flash in a 1. 25 Msun star, the core carbon flash in a 9. 3 Msun star, and of oxygen burning shell in a star with a mass of 23 Msun. We simulate the hydrodynamic behavior of shell convection during various phases of stellar evolution with the Eulerian hydrodynamics code HERAKLES in two and three spatial dimensions. Initial models for this purpose are obtained by state-of-the-art stellar evolutionary codes, namely GARSTEC, STAREVOL, and TYCHO for the core helium flash, core carbon flash, and oxygen shell burning, respectively. Most of our analysis is performed for two-dimensional hydrodynamic models of shell convection during the core helium flash at its peak covering approximately 250 convective turnover timescales. The mixing manifests itself in the form of overdense and <b>cold</b> fingers <b>enriched</b> with matter of higher mean molecular weight, originating from density fluctuations at the lower boundary of the convective shell, and "shooting" down into the core. They result from the Rayleigh-Taylor instability at the lower convection zone boundary due to a negative mean molecular weight gradient.

40|$|International audienceNumerous current marks are {{recorded}} on an Early Aptian unconformity surface observed {{over a large}} area of the Vocontian basin and its southern margin (southeastern France, Subalpine ranges). They Occur in the transition zone between that basin and the adjacent Provence platform and correspond to various erosion marks, oriented biogenic remains (sponge spicules, belemnite rostra) and trace fossil directions (Rhizocorallium). Three local current orientations occur : 1) a westward orientation in the neritic zone, probably resulting from the trade winds that prevailed in the Tethyan domain; 2) a northward orientation in the deeper hemipelagic and pelagic zones probably resulting from a deviation of the westward Currents by the Coriolis force; 3) a southward orientation in the eastern and western margins of the studied area, possibly induced by upwellings resulting from offshore northward deviated currents. These upwellings were characterized by <b>cold</b> ater <b>enriched</b> with silica, phosphorous and organic matter. Some characteristics of the Early Aptian unconformity surface re suit from these different currents : 1) {{a specific type of}} erosion linked to mechanical and/or chemical features, 2) all erosion intensity displayed by the importance of the pre-Aptian stratigraphic gaps, 3) an erosion duration illustrated by the importance of the post-Aptian gaps. The spatial distribution of these features was controlled by the water-depth, depending locally on the occurrence of hemipelagic submarine reliefs of tectonic origin. Increases in current activity in the Early Aptian, linked to an acceleration of the atmospheric circulation, and highlighed by erosion and phosphatisation had previously been recorded for many other Eurasian and North Atlantic sites. This large spatial distribution suggests a global cause Such as a temporary increase in the latitudinal thermal gradient and seasonal contrasts.

In this paper, we examine the impact of cold seepage on their caging sediments, as far as their geochemical composition and microfaunal content are concerned. To this end, two fossil cold seeps of the Jurassic Beauvoisin site (Vocontian Trough, SE-France) are studied, focusing on the redox-sensitive and/or sulfide-forming trace metals. We observe that: 1) the carbonate edifices of the <b>cold</b> seeps are <b>enriched</b> in specific elements, namely, Sr, Mo As and Sb, compared to their caging marlstones, and 2) the benthic foraminifer populations were present close to the edifices. The Sr enrichment is ascribed to a contamination of the seeping fluids at the contact with underlying evaporites; the Mo-As-Sb enrichment may have several, non-exclusive, origins. We retain two scenarios; in the first one, the enrichment is due to the ascending fluids that could collect these elements when passing through thick shaly formations; in the second scenario, Mo, As and Sb were supplied to the sites of carbonate precipitation together with Fe- and Mn-oxy-hydroxides (the so-called particulate shuttle process). We favor the second scenario (possibly coupled to the first one) because the rather uncommon Mo-As-Sb association is also observed for reducing sediments deposited under the influence of Fe-Mn-shuttling...|$|R

The goal is to {{gain an understanding of}} the expected fragmentation mass scale and thus the characteristic mass of the first population of stars to form by shock fragmentation.

In this physical regime, if molecular cooling is absent because of a strong LW background, we find there to be a sharp drop in the fragmentation mass at a metallicity of Z ∼ 10 − 4 Z.

We determine electron temperatures in the knots based on several diagnostics. The [O III] nebular-to-auroral transition ratio yields temperatures of the order of 17 000 K. The weak temperature dependence of the ratios of helium lines at 4471, 5876 and 6678 Angstroms is used to derive a temperature of 8850 K for knot J 3 and 4600 K for knot J 1. Ratios of O II recombination lines, which directly measure the temperature in the coldest regions of the knots, are used to derive temperatures of 2500 K for knot J 3, and just 500 K for knot J 1. We calculate abundances both from collisionally excited lines and from the well-observed recombination spectra of C, N, O and Ne ions. The forbidden line abundances agree well with previous determinations, but the recombination line abundances are several hundred times higher.

MethodsWe analyzed a prospectively compiled database containing all 111 consecutive patients who underwent thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm open repair at our center from 2008 to 2011. A cohort of 104 consecutive patients was identified of which 50 (48 %) had renal perfusion with Custodiol and 54 (52 %) with lactated Ringer's solution. Propensity score matching based on baseline clinical variables, which {{were expected to}} influence renal outcomes, was performed to correct for any bias {{that may have been}} {{associated with the use of}} Custodiol. Acute kidney injury (AKI) as defined by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines and perioperative estimated glomerular filtration rate were compared in the two groups. Independent predictors of AKI were also identified by multivariate analysis. ResultsAfter propensity score matching, we were able to match 42 Custodiol cases one-to-one with those receiving perfusion with lactated Ringer's solution. Overall 30 -day mortality was 5. 9 %; temporary hemodialysis or continuous veno-venous hemofiltration was needed in 4. 8 % of the patients without any case of dialysis at discharge. Freedom from AKI was significantly increased in the Custodiol group (38. 1 % vs 9. 5 %; P =. 002) despite longer total renal ischemic time (51. 5  ± 16. 4  minutes vs 43. 6  ± 16. 0  minutes; P =. 05).

40|$|Abstract Background The plant {{tolerance}} {{mechanisms to}} low temperature {{have been studied}} extensively in the model plant Arabidopsis at the transcriptional level. However, few {{studies were carried out}} in plants with strong inherited cold tolerance. Chorispora bungeana is a subnival alpine plant possessing strong cold tolerance mechanisms. To get a deeper insight into its cold tolerance mechanisms, the transcriptome profiles of chilling-treated C. bungeana seedlings were analyzed by Illumina deep-sequencing and compared with Arabidopsis. Results Two cDNA libraries constructed from mRNAs of control and chilling-treated seedlings were sequenced by Illumina technology. A total of 54, 870 unigenes were obtained by de novo assembly, and 3, 484 chilling up-regulated and 4, 571 down-regulated unigenes were identified. The expressions of 18 out of top 20 up-regulated unigenes were confirmed by qPCR analysis. Functional network analysis of the up-regulated genes revealed some common biological processes, including cold responses, and molecular functions in C. bungeana and Arabidopsis responding to chilling. Karrikins were found as new plant growth regulators involved in chilling responses of C. bungeana and Arabidopsis. However, genes involved in <b>cold</b> acclimation were <b>enriched</b> in chilling up-regulated genes in Arabidopsis but not in C. bungeana. In addition, although transcription activations were stimulated in both C. bungeana and Arabidopsis, no CBF putative ortholog was up-regulated in C. bungeana while CBF 2 and CBF 3 were chilling up-regulated in Arabidopsis. On the other hand, up-regulated genes related to protein phosphorylation and auto-ubiquitination processes were over-represented in C. bungeana but not in Arabidopsis. Conclusions We conducted the first deep-sequencing transcriptome profiling and chilling stress regulatory network analysis of C. bungeana, a subnival alpine plant with inherited cold tolerance. Comparative transcriptome analysis suggests that cold acclimation is not a major chilling tolerance mechanism of C. bungeana. Activation of protein phosphorylation and ubiquitination may confer chilling tolerance to C. bungeana in a more rapid and flexible way than cold acclimation. Such differences {{may have contributed to the}} differences in cold tolerance between C. bungeana and Arabidopsis. The results presented in this paper will be informative for gene discovery and the molecular mechanisms related to plant cold tolerance. </p...|$|R

Field data, such as common foliation, strong shear deformation occasionally leading to mylonitization, together with petrographic data, including reduction in grain size with corroded borders, show characteristics of the syn-kinematic emplacement of the granitoids. Single zircon evaporation ages define a minimum age of 3127 Ma for the tonalitic-trondhjemitic-granodioritic (TTG) basement and 2552 - 2534 Ma plateau ages for the emplacement of the granitoids, which slightly predate (20 - 30 Ma) the emplacement of the 2518 Ma Closepet batholith. Major and trace element data, together with isotopic data, suggest at least four magmatic suites from Closepet batholith to the east, which have independent magmatic evolution histories. The observed data are compatible with magma mixing for the Closepet batholith, melting of TTG and assimilation-fractional crystallization processes for Bangalore granites, either melting of heterogeneous source or different degree of melting of the same source for the granitoids of Hoskote-Kolar and fractional crystallization for the western margin of the KSB. Isotopic (Nd-Sr) and geochemical data (LREE and LIL elements) suggest highly enriched mantle and ancient TTG crust for the Closepet batholith, enriched mantle and TTG crust for the Bangalore granites, c. a. chondritic mantle source for the granitoids of Hoskote-Kolar and the quartz monzonites of the western margin of the KSB and slightly depleted mantle for granodiorites of the eastern margin of the KSB. We interpret all these geochronologic, geochemical and isotopic characteristics of granitoids from the Closepet batholith to the east up to the KSB {{in terms of a}} plume model. The centre of the plume would be an enriched 'hot spot' in the mantle that lies below the present exposure level of the Closepet batholith. Melting of such an enriched mantle hot spot produces high temperature magmas (Closepet) that penetrate overlying ancient crust, where they strongly interact and induce partial melting of the surrounding crust. These magmas cool very slowly, as the hot spot maintains high temperatures for a long time; thus they appear younger (2518 Ma). On the contrary, to the east the plume induces melting of c. a. chondritic or slightly depleted mantle that produces relatively <b>colder</b> and less <b>enriched</b> magmas, which show less or no interactions with the surrounding crust and cool rapidly and appear slightly older (2552 - 2534 Ma).
