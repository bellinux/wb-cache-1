25|$|The gas-cooled {{fast reactor}} (GFR) system {{features}} a fast-neutron spectrum and closed fuel cycle for efficient conversion of fertile uranium {{and management of}} actinides. The reactor is helium-cooled and with an outlet temperature of 850°C it is an evolution of the very-high-temperature reactor (VHTR) to a more sustainable fuel cycle. It will use a direct Brayton cycle gas turbine for high thermal efficiency. Several fuel forms are being considered for their potential to operate at very high temperatures and to ensure an excellent retention of fission products: composite <b>ceramic</b> <b>fuel,</b> advanced fuel particles, or ceramic clad elements of actinide compounds.

25|$|Pressurized water reactor (PWR) fuel {{consists}} of cylindrical rods put into bundles. A uranium oxide ceramic is formed into pellets and inserted into Zircaloy tubes that are bundled together. The Zircaloy tubes are about 1cm in diameter, and the fuel cladding gap {{is filled with}} helium gas to improve the conduction of heat from the fuel to the cladding. There are about 179-264 fuel rods per fuel bundle and about 121 to 193 fuel bundles are loaded into a reactor core. Generally, the fuel bundles consist of fuel rods bundled 14×14 to 17×17. PWR fuel bundles are about 4 meters long. In PWR fuel bundles, control rods are inserted through the top directly into the fuel bundle. The fuel bundles usually are enriched several percent in 235U. The uranium oxide is dried before inserting into the tubes to try to eliminate moisture in the <b>ceramic</b> <b>fuel</b> {{that can lead to}} corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement. The Zircaloy tubes are pressurized with helium to try to minimize pellet-cladding interaction which can lead to fuel rod failure over long periods.|$|E

25|$|The pebble-bed reactor, a {{high-temperature}} gas-cooled reactor (HTGCR), {{is designed}} so high temperatures reduce power output by Doppler broadening of the fuel's neutron cross-section. It uses <b>ceramic</b> <b>fuels</b> so its safe operating temperatures exceed the power-reduction temperature range. Most designs are cooled by inert helium. Helium {{is not subject}} to steam explosions, resists neutron absorption leading to radioactivity, and does not dissolve contaminants that can become radioactive. Typical designs have more layers (up to 7) of passive containment than light water reactors (usually3). A unique feature that may aid safety is that the fuel-balls actually form the core's mechanism, and are replaced one-by-one as they age. The design of the fuel makes fuel reprocessing expensive.|$|R

In this model, the fuel-kernel and silicon carbide matrix temperatures are distinguished. Moreover, the obtained temperature profiles are more realistic than those obtained using other models. Using the temperature-dependent thermal conductivities of uranium nitride and the silicon carbide matrix, temperature-dependent homogenized parameters were obtained. In Part II of the paper, coupled with the COREDAX code, a reactor core loaded by fully <b>ceramic</b> microencapsulated <b>fuel</b> in which tristructural isotropic particles are randomly dispersed in the fine lattice stochastic structure is analyzed via a two-temperature homogenized model at steady and transient states.

40|$|The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has {{initiated}} {{an effort to}} evaluate the viability of using ultrasonic thermometry technology as an improved sensor for detecting temperature during irradiation testing of advanced fuels proposed within the Fuel Cycle Research and Development (FCR&D) program sponsored by the U. S. Department of Energy (US DOE). Ultrasonic thermometers (UTs) work {{on the principle that}} the speed at which sound travels through a material (acoustic velocity) is dependent on the temperature of the material. UTs have several advantages over other types of temperature sensors. UTs can be made very small, as the sensor consists only of a small diameter rod {{which may or may not}} require a sheath. Measurements may be made up to very high temperature (near the melting point of the sensor material) and, as no electrical insulation is required, shunting effects observed in traditional high temperature thermocouple applications are avoided. Most attractive, however, is the ability to introduce multiple acoustic discontinuities into the sensor, as this enables temperature profiling with a single sensor. The current paper presents initial results from FCR&D UT development efforts. These developments include improved methods for fabricating magnetostrictive transducers and joining them to waveguides, characterization of candidate sensor materials appropriate for use in FCR&D <b>fuels</b> irradiations (both <b>ceramic</b> <b>fuels</b> in inert gas and sodium bonded metallic fuels), enhanced signal processing techniques, and tests to determine potential accuracy and resolution...|$|R
