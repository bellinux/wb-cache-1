40|$|An {{efficient}} multicomponent domino {{process that}} works {{under mild conditions}} {{was used for the}} synthesis of systematically modified neomycin-sugar conjugates. The final aminoglycoside derivatives were tested against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella, and E. coli strains, and show activity comparable to the parent antibiotics. Such a strategy can impact multicomponent <b>combinatorial</b> <b>syntheses</b> of diverse biologically active conjugates...|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 90’s, Wigler and {{collaborator}} W. Clark Still at Columbia University developed {{the first method}} for encoded <b>combinatorial</b> chemical <b>synthesis,</b> a method for building vast libraries of chemical compounds.

50|$|An area {{of special}} {{interest}} to Baruch is an innovative process for developing new materials called combinatorial chemistry. It applies a convergence of genomics, Moore’s law hardware and custom software to enable high throughput screening of new materials. Tom has pioneered CMEA’s investments in companies that apply <b>combinatorial</b> <b>synthesis</b> including Codexis, Intermolecular, Symyx Technologies, and Wildcat Discovery.|$|E
5000|$|In {{its modern}} form, {{combinatorial}} chemistry has probably had its biggest {{impact in the}} pharmaceutical industry. Researchers attempting to optimize the activity profile of a compound create a 'library' of many different but related compounds. [...] Advances in robotics have led to an industrial approach to <b>combinatorial</b> <b>synthesis,</b> enabling companies to routinely produce over 100,000 new and unique compounds per year.|$|E
5000|$|Fodor {{and colleagues}} {{developed}} a unique fabrication process (later used by Affymetrix) {{in which a}} series of microlithography steps is used to combinatorially synthesize {{hundreds of thousands of}} unique, single-stranded DNA sensors on a substrate one nucleotide at a time. [...] One lithography step is needed per base type; thus, a total of four steps is required per nucleotide level. Although this technique is very powerful in that many sensors can be created simultaneously, it is currently only feasible for creating short DNA strands (15 - 25 nucleotides). Reliability and cost factors limit the number of photolithography steps that can be done. Furthermore, light-directed <b>combinatorial</b> <b>synthesis</b> techniques are not currently possible for proteins or other sensing molecules.|$|E
40|$|Presented here is {{a method}} for rapidly testing the {{reactivity}} of carboxylic acids in amide-forming reactions. For this, a mixture of two acids, one a reference compound, and one acid whose reactivity is unknown, are coupled to an aminoacylated tetrakis(paminophenyl) porphyrin under typical peptide coupling conditions. The product distribution in the resulting library is analyzed via MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to reveal the relative reactivity. This rapid reactivity test requires sub-nanomole quantities of acids, does not involve cleavage from a support or any potentially biasing work-up, and is automatable. Thus, it is well suited for testing building blocks for <b>combinatorial</b> <b>syntheses.</b> Further, it is demonstrated that step-wise coupling can produce near-statistically distributed libraries of porphyrins when acids of very different reactivity are employed...|$|R
40|$|CMOS - Based Peptide Arrays Peptide arrays are an {{important}} tool in proteomics and peptidomics, allowing {{a large number of}} peptides to be synthesized on a common support and exposed to a solution of target molecules in parallel. In particle-based synthesis, the amino acids for in situ synthesis of peptides are transported to synthesis loci in solid particles and released upon melting, allowing an increase in density over liquid-based systems. This thesis focuses on the development of application-specific high voltage integrated circuits for electrostatic deposition of charged amino acid particles and their integration into a <b>combinatorial</b> peptide <b>synthesis</b> system. Transfer of amino acid particles from the aerosol to synthesis loci on the chip surface was investigated for a pixel pitch between 45 µm and 100 µm, and compatibility between the chips, particle transfer and the poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate - based surface modifi¬cations was established. The first <b>combinatorial</b> <b>syntheses</b> on CMOS chips were performed with over 16, 000 distinct synthesis sites per chip, at a density of 10, 000 spots per cm 2, which is a 25 -fold increase over the 400 spots per cm 2 currently available on laser-printed glass slides. For FLAG and HA peptide epitopes, immonostaining showed regular spots of comparable signal intensity over the whole chip area...|$|R

The resulting library is characterized directly by automated microdiffraction...|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} DNA-encoding was first {{described}} in a theoretical paper by Brenner and Lerner in 1992 in which was proposed to link each molecule of a chemically synthesized entity to a particular oligonucleotide sequence constructed in parallel and to use this encoding genetic tag to identify and enrich active compounds. In 1993 the first practical implementation of this approach was presented by S. Brenner and K. Janda and similarly by the group of M.A. Gallop. Brenner and Janda suggested to generate individual encoded library members by an alternating parallel <b>combinatorial</b> <b>synthesis</b> of the heteropolymeric chemical compound and the appropriate oligonucleotide sequence on the same bead in a “split-&-pool”-based fashion (see below).|$|E
50|$|However, litographic {{methods can}} be used to {{overcome}} the problem of excessive number of coupling cycles. <b>Combinatorial</b> <b>synthesis</b> of peptide arrays onto a microchip by laser printing has been described, where a modified colour laser printer is used in combination with conventional solid-phase peptide synthesis chemistry. Amino acids are immobilized within toner particles, and the peptides are printed onto the chip surface in consecutive, combinatorial layers. Melting of the toner upon the start of the coupling reaction ensures that delivery of the amino acids and the coupling reaction can be performed independently. Another advantage of this method is that each amino acid can be produced and purified separately, followed by embedding it into the toner particles, which allows long-term storage.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{types of}} {{automation}} are classified by {{the type of}} solid-phase substrates, the methods for adding and removing reagents, and design of reaction chambers. Polymer resins may be used as a substrate for solid-phase. It is not a true combinatorial method in the sense that [...] "split-mix" [...] where a peptide compound is split into different groups and reacted with different compounds. This is then mixed back together split into more groups and each groups is reacted with a different compound. Instead the [...] "parallel-synthesis" [...] method does not mix, but reacts different groups of the same peptide with different compounds and allows for the identification of the individual compound on each solid support. A popular method implemented is the reaction block system due to its relative low cost and higher output of new compounds compared to other [...] "parallel-synthesis" [...] methods. Parallel-Synthesis was developed by Mario Geysen and his colleagues and is not a true type of <b>combinatorial</b> <b>synthesis,</b> but can be incorporated into a <b>combinatorial</b> <b>synthesis.</b> This group synthesized 96 peptides on plastic pins coated with a solid support for the solid phase peptide synthesis. This method uses a rectangular block moved by a robot so that reagents can be pipetted by a robotic pipetting system. This block is separated into wells which the individual reactions take place. These compounds are later cleaved from the solid-phase of the well for further analysis. Another method is the closed reactor system which uses a completely closed off reaction vessel with a series of fixed connections to dispense. Though the produce fewer number of compounds than other methods, its main advantage is the control over the reagents and reaction conditions. Early closed reaction systems were developed for peptide synthesis which required variations in temperature and a diverse range of reagents. Some closed reactor system robots have a temperature range of 200 °C and over 150 reagents.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Combinatorial {{chemistry}} {{has contributed}} to the preparation of biologically important oligosaccharide and glycoconjugate libraries, with a view of improving our understanding of the complex interaction between the carbohydrates and their protein-based receptors. The <b>combinatorial</b> carbohydrate <b>synthesis</b> strategies, developed in the past decade, provide access to small and medium size libraries. This mini review critically examines both the solution phase and solid phase strategies that have been reported to date...|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to traditional <b>combinatorial</b> <b>synthesis</b> where {{a library of}} catalysts were first generated and later screened (as in the two above approaches), dynamic combinatorial library approach utilizes a mixture of multicomponent building blocks that reversibly form library of catalysts. With out a template, the library consists of a roughly equal mixture of different combination of building blocks. In {{the presence of a}} template which is either a starting material or a TSA, the combination that provides the best binding to the template is thermodynamically favorable and thus that combination is more prevalent than other library members. The biased ratio of the desired catalyst to other combinatorial products could then be frozen by terminating the reversibility of the equilibrium by means such as change in temperature, pH, or radiation to yield the optimal catalyst. For example, Lehn et al. used this method to create a dynamic combinatorial library of imine inhibitor from a set of amines and a set of aldehydes. After some time, the equilibrium was terminated by an addition of NaBH3CN to afford the desired catalyst.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the past}} 20 years, Schreiber has {{attempted}} to systematize the application of small molecules to biology {{through the development of}} technologies that inclue diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS), chemical genetics, and ChemBank. Schreiber has shown that DOS can produce small molecules distributed in defined ways in chemical space by virtue of their different skeletons and stereochemistry, and that it can provide chemical handles on products anticipating the need for follow-up chemistry using, for example, <b>combinatorial</b> <b>synthesis</b> and the so-called Build/Couple/Pair strategy of modular chemical synthesis. DOS pathways and new techniques for small-molecule screening [...] provided many new, potentially disruptive insights into biology. For example, Schreiber and collaborator Tim Mitchison used cytoblot screening to discover monastrol - the first small-molecule inhibitor of mitosis that does not target tubulin. Monastrol was shown to inhibit kinesin-5, a motor protein and was used to gain new insights into the functions of kinesin-5. This work led pharmaceutical company Merck, among others, to pursue anti-cancer drugs that target human kinesin-5. Small-molecule probes of histone and tubulin deacetylases, transcription factors, cytoplasmic anchoring proteins, developmental signaling proteins (e.g., histacin, tubacin, haptamide, uretupamine, concentramide, and calmodulophilin), among many others, have been discovered in the Schreiber lab using diversity-oriented synthesis and chemical genetics. Multidimensional screening was introduced in 2002 and has provided insights into tumorigenesis, cell polarity, and chemical space, among others.|$|E

By improving the safety features of conventional microwave ovens to give them greater control and feedback capabilities, chemists have been able to increase the potential applications for this technology. Consequently, the ability of microwave ovens to enhance the rates of various physical and chemical reactions is now being exploited in areas such as <b>combinatorial</b> organic <b>synthesis,</b> extraction of organic environmental pollutants, and digestion of samples for elemental analysis...|$|R
40|$|Polymer beads are the {{starting}} point of many synthetic protocols, and in a number of <b>combinatorial</b> <b>syntheses</b> such studies are based on single beads. It has therefore become important that individual beads carry the same functional group activity and quality control of populations of beads requires a knowledge of the distribution of activity between the individual beads. A procedure was developed for the measurement of the thiol loading of single copolymer beads which is based on the bleaching of Michler's hydrol [4, 4 '-bis(dimethylamino) diphenylcarbinol (BDC-OH) ]. Flow injection colorimetry permits the small volumes of solution generated from single beads to be measured with rapid turnover and with a reproducibility of ca. 2 %. The solution detection limit of 0. 17 mM corresponds to a bead thiol concentration of 0. 33 mmol g(- 1). The procedure and the variability of a bead population were demonstrated using modified styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer beads. The apparatus allowed fast, simple and accurate determinations to be carried out on the individual polymer beads. Within a single batch of thiol-modified styrene-divinylbenzene beads thiol loadings ranged from mol per bead. Polydispersity may therefore significantly influence screening decisions based on single bead syntheses...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen {{storage is}} the most {{challenging}} task for the hydrogen economy. We established a multidisciplinary research program for high throughput <b>combinatorial</b> <b>synthesis</b> and characterization of novel nanoporous and metastable complex hydrides, coupled to fundamental material studies including electronic, structural and kinetic transport modeling, and pump-probe experiments. Our research is based the concept of hybrid nanostructures that store hydrogen {{by a combination of}} chemi- and physorption: atomic hydrogen is stored in metastable hydrides while molecule hydrogen is stored in the nanometer pores of the hydrides. Metastable nanostructured hydride has been achieved by introducing structural and compositional disorders through high throughput elemental substitution/doping, catalyst addition, and nonequilibrium processing. Fast screening compatible with the <b>combinatorial</b> <b>synthesis</b> was achieved by combining X-ray structural characterization with the development of a laser-based microbalance. Manufacturing of nanoporous metahydrides that are identified as promising by the <b>combinatorial</b> <b>synthesis</b> has been explored along with the materials search...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{the notion}} that dimerization and/or {{variation}} of amino acid 1 of vancomycin could potentially enhance biological activity, a series of synthetic and chemical biology studies were undertaken in order to discover potent antibacterial agents. Herein we describe two ligation methods (disulfide formation and olefin metathesis) for dimerizing vancomycin derivatives and applications of target-accelerated <b>combinatorial</b> <b>synthesis</b> (e. g. <b>combinatorial</b> <b>synthesis</b> in the presence of vancomycin's target Ac 2 -l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala) to generate libraries of vancomycin dimers. Screening of these compound libraries led to the identification of a number of highly potent antibiotics effective against vancomycin-suspectible, vancomycin-intermediate resistant and, most significantly, vancomycin-resistant bacteria...|$|E
40|$|Many {{next-generation}} {{technologies are}} limited by material performance, leading to increased interest in the discovery of advanced materials using <b>combinatorial</b> <b>synthesis,</b> characterization, and screening. Several <b>combinatorial</b> <b>synthesis</b> techniques, such as solution based methods, advanced manufacturing, and physical vapor deposition, are currently being employed for various applications. In particular, combinatorial magnetron sputtering is a versatile technique that provides synthesis of high-quality thin film composition libraries. Spatially addressing the composition of these thin films generally requires elemental quantification measurements using techniques such as energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy or X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. Since these measurements are performed ex-situ and post-deposition, {{they are unable to}} provide real-time design of experiments, a capability that is required for rapid synthesis of a specific composition library. By using three quartz crystal monitors attached to a stage with translational and rotational degrees of freedom, we measure three-dimensional deposition profiles of deposition sources whose tilt with respect to the substrate is robotically controlled. We exhibit the utility of deposition profiles and tilt control to optimize the deposition geometry for specific <b>combinatorial</b> <b>synthesis</b> experiments...|$|E
40|$|Directed sort-and-combine {{strategies}} {{offer the}} efficiency of <b>combinatorial</b> split-and-mix <b>synthesis,</b> with the discrimination to produce only the desired compounds. The technique involve {{the placement of the}} microspheres into the reaction vessels, namely random (split-and-mix) versus directed (sort-and-combine). Therefore, it is a requirement of directed sort-and-combine strategies for the microspheres to be pre-encoded to determine the appropriate reaction vessel for each microsphere. An instrumental technique was also developed to use the fluorescently labeled microspheres to produce a large oligonucleotide library via a directed sort-and-combine process...|$|R

To enhance fluorescent signals and hence assay sensitivity, two different systems were developed using two different dendrimeric constructs. In the first case, a triple branched dendrimer bearing three dansyl groups was used to enhance assay sensitivity and showed a significant enhancement of fluorescence following enzymatic cleavage. In another example, a tris-fluorescein probe, that undergoes self-quenching, was utilized in a <b>combinatorial</b> library <b>synthesis</b> to map the substrate specificity of proteases...|$|R
