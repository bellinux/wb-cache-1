40|$|Base {{excision}} repair (BER) provides relief from many DNA lesions. While BER enzymes have been characterized biochemically, BER functions within cells {{are much less}} understood, in part because replication bypass and double-strand break (DSB) repair can also impact resistance to base damage. To investigate BER in vivo, we examined the repair of methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) induced DNA damage in haploid G 1 yeast cells, so that replication bypass and recombinational DSB repair cannot occur. Based on the heat-lability of MMS-induced base damage, an assay was developed that monitors secondary breaks in full-length yeast chromosomes where closely spaced breaks yield DSBs that are observed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The assay detects damaged bases and abasic (AP) sites as heat-dependent breaks as well as intermediate heat-independent breaks that arise during BER. Using a circular <b>chromosome,</b> <b>lesion</b> frequency and repair kinetics could be easily determined. Monitoring BER in single and multiple glycosylase and AP-endonuclease mutants confirmed that Mag 1 is the major enzyme that removes MMS-damaged bases. This approach provided direct physical evidence that Apn 1 and Apn 2 not only repair cellular base damage but also prevent break accumulation that can result from AP sites being channeled into other BER pathway(s) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Spontaneous {{levels of}} the {{chromosome}} aberrations in the peripheral lymphocytes of 173 women were analyzed {{in the course of}} a medical examination of the residents of the Bryansk District territories (Klintsy Region, and the town of Klintsy) contaminated after the Chernobyl NPP accident in April 1986. The study population included only women who had been premenopausal at the time of the accident (mean age in 1986 was 23. 9 ± 0. 7 years, ranging 2 to 56 years). The territory contamination with 137 Cs ranged from 1. 8 to 23. 7 Ci/km 2, the mean value being 7. 5 ± 0. 2 Ci/km 2. The range of the calculated absorbed thyroid doses was 30 to 340 mGy (in average, 52. 3 ± 3. 3 mGy). The number of women with benign breast diseases (BBD) was 116 (67 %). All recognizable <b>chromosome</b> <b>lesion</b> types were scored in the first in vitro division metaphases stained with azure-eosin. The mean total aberration frequency in the sample studied was 3. 5 ± 0. 2 per 100 metaphases, the main contribution being made by the chromatid deletions, which is typical for a normal spontaneous aberration pattern. Based on the results of the cytogenetic analysis, the study population was subdivided into two groups.

40|$|Background: In humans, {{chromosome}} fragile {{sites are}} regions that are especially prone to forming non-staining gaps, constrictions or breaks {{in one or}} both of the chromatids on metaphase chromosomes either spontaneously or following partial inhibition of DNA synthesis and have been well identified. So far, no plant chromosome fragile sites similar to those in human chromosomes have been reported. Methods and Results: During the course of cytological mapping of rDNA on ryegrass chromosomes, we found that the number of chromosomes plus chromosome fragments was often more than the expected 14 in most cells for Lolium perenne L. cv. Player by close cytological examination using a routine chromosome preparation procedure. Further fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using 45 S rDNA as a probe indicated that the root-tip cells having more than a 14 chromosome plus chromosome fragment count were a result of chromosome breakage or gap formation in vitro (referred to as <b>chromosome</b> <b>lesions)</b> at 45 S rDNA sites, and 86 % of the cells exhibited chromosome breaks or gaps and all occurred at the sites of 45 S rDNA in Lolium perenne L. cv. Player, as well as in L. multiflorum Lam. cv. Top One. Chromatin depletion or decondensation occurred at various locations within the 45 S rDNA regions, suggesting heterogeneity of lesions of 45 S rDNA sites with respect to their position within the rDNA region.

Single chromosomes isolated from metaphase cells and stained with DNA intercalating dye DAPI were analyzed in the ICP 22 with a modified flow chamber. In order to study dose-dependent {{changes in the}} flow karyotypes, they were split into peak- and background-portions by an iterative fit algorithm. As in a first approach, estimates of the frequencies of <b>chromosome</b> <b>lesions</b> were derived from {{an evaluation of the}} dose-dependent reduction in peak contents. The number of radiation-induced <b>lesions</b> per <b>chromosome</b> was found to be proportional to its length. As a second approach, the number of fluorescence events in the histogram background was corrected for non-chromosomal debris and evaluated interms of chromosome aberration frequency per cell, which was consistent with the yields of dicentric chromosomes and acentric fragments observed in microscopic investigations. As a third approach, lesion frequencies were calculated from the corrected background light sum in the karyotypes, utilizing a Monte Carlo model to simulate the effect of aberration formation on the flow histogram. The results indicate that the number of <b>chromosome</b> <b>lesions</b> observed by flow cytometry can be quantitatively related to the yield of structural chromosome aberrations detected by microscopic analysis. Dose-effect relations and split-dose kinetics are given as examples demonstrating the usefulness of this technique in radiobiology.

40|$|Chromosomal {{replication}} is {{entwined with}} DNA damage tolerance (DDT) and chromatin structure establishment via elusive mechanisms. Here we examined how specific replication conditions affecting replisome architecture and repriming impact on DDT. We show that Saccharomyces cerevisiae Polα/Primase/Ctf 4 mutants, proficient in bulk DNA replication, are defective in recombination-mediated damage-bypass by template switching (TS) and have reduced sister chromatid cohesion. The decrease in error-free DDT {{is accompanied by}} increased usage of mutagenic DDT, fork reversal, and higher rates of genome rearrangements mediated by faulty strand annealing. Notably, the DDT defects of Polα/Primase/Ctf 4 mutants are not the consequence of increased sister chromatid distance, but are instead caused by altered single-stranded DNA metabolism and abnormal replication fork topology. We propose that error-free TS is driven by timely replicative helicase-coupled re-priming. Defects in this event impact on replication fork architecture and sister chromatid proximity, and represent a frequent source of <b>chromosome</b> <b>lesions</b> upon replication dysfunctions...|$|R

Fifty-five adult de novo AML (group A) and 27 elderly AML or AML after myelodysplastic syndrome (AML-MDS) (group B) were tested using probes detecting the following anomalies: - 5, - 7, + 8, deletions of 5 q 31, 7 q 31, 12 p 13 /ETV 6, 17 p 13 /p 53, 20 q 11. All the patients had a normal karyotype in more than 20 cells and tested negative for the common AML-associated fusion genes. No patient in group A was found to carry occult chromosome anomalies, whereas 8 / 27 patients in group B (P < 0. 0001) showed 5 q 31 or 7 q 31 deletion (three cases each), a 17 p 13 /p 53 deletion or trisomy 8 (one case each) in 33 - 60 % interphase cells. Metaphase cells showed only one hybridization signal at 5 q 31 (three cases) and 7 q 31 (one case), whereas two normal signals at 7 q 31 and chromosome 8 centromeres were seen in two patients with 7 q deletion and trisomy 8 in interphase cells. The majority of blast cells (76 - 94 %) carried the chromosome anomaly in all cases; erythroid involvement in a minority of cells was seen in three patients. In group B, the presence of occult chromosome anomalies was associated with exposure to myelotoxic agents in the workplace (5 / 8 cases vs 3 / 19, P = 0. 026) and with a lower complete remission rate (0 / 6 patients vs 7 / 12, P = 0. 024).

Dose-response curves for X rays and neutrons show that cell reproductive death and changes in flow karyotypes result from damage, induced with a similar relative biological effectiveness.

40|$|S-phase cells {{overcome}} <b>chromosome</b> <b>lesions</b> through replication-coupled recombination {{processes that}} seem to be assisted by recombination-dependent DNA structures and/or replication-related sister chromatid junctions. RecQ helicases, including yeast Sgs 1 and human BLM, have been implicated in both replication and recombination and protect genome integrity by preventing unscheduled mitotic recombination events. We have studied the RecQ helicase-mediated mechanisms controlling genome stability by analyzing replication forks encountering a damaged template in sgs 1 cells. We show that, in sgs 1 mutants, recombination-dependent cruciform structures accumulate at damaged forks. Their accumulation requires Rad 51 protein, is counteracted by Srs 2 DNA helicase, and does not prevent fork movement. Sgs 1, but not Srs 2, promotes resolution of these recombination intermediates. A functional Rad 53 checkpoint kinase that is known to protect the integrity of the sister chromatid junctions is required for the accumulation of recombination intermediates in sgs 1 mutants. Finally, top 3 and top 3 sgs 1 mutants accumulate the same structures as sgs 1 cells. We suggest that, in sgs 1 cells, the unscheduled accumulation of Rad 51 -dependent cruciform structures at damaged forks result from defective maturation of recombination-dependent intermediates that originate from the replication-related sister chromatid junctions. Our findings might contribute to explaining some of the recombination defects of BLM cells...|$|R

40|$|Background. In chronic {{lymphocytic}} leukemia (CLL) molecular cytogenetic abnormalities may identify specific disease entities and {{may be associated with}} distinct prognosis. Currently, peripheral blood is the preferred source to assess the biological risk. However, fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) on paraffin-embedded fixed tissues (PEFT) may also be used to study cytogenetic abnormalities in CLL lymph-node where the “proliferation center” (PC) is the histopatologic hallmark. PCs probably represent the sites where T-dependent immune responses to unknown antigens promote clonal B cell selection and expansion. Aims. i) to analyze the sensitivity and reproducibility of FISH on PEFT, ii) to correlate specific <b>chromosome</b> <b>lesions</b> to PC extension; iii) to estimate the frequency of <b>chromosome</b> <b>lesions</b> on lymph node samples. Method: 183 CLL cases (including 20 Richter syndrome, RS) arranged in 5 tissue macro-arrays (TMAs) were analyzed by FISH for deletions involving 11 q 23 /ATM, 13 q 14 and 17 p 13 /p 53; trisomy 12; and translocations involving the immunoglobulin gene (IgH) on band 14 q 32. Cytogenetic features were correlated to 2 histologic patterns: 1) PC-rich group including CLL cases with confluent and large PCs and RS cases and 2) typical group with scattered, well-distinct PCs. Results. Assessable data with the complete 5 probe-panel were obtained in 101 / 183 cases (55, 1 %); in 58 cases the results were partial and in 24 cases no data were collected for all the probes mainly because of insufficient numbers of cells on TMA samples. Chromosomal aberrations were detected in 79 / 101 cases (78. 2 %). The most frequent abnormality was 13 q- (36. 7 % of the cases), followed by 14 q 32 translocations (30. 8 %), 11 q- (24. 7 %), + 12 (19. 5 %) and 17 p- (15. 6 %). Ten cases showed 14 q 32 /IgH gene extra-copies (3 - 5 signals in 10 - 30 % of the nuclei). 17 p-, + 12 and 14 q 32 /IgH translocations were more frequently encountered in the PCs-rich group (P<. 001,. 030 and. 043 respectively). The PC-rich group was significantly associated to “high-risk”cytogenetic abnormalities (11 q- and/or 17 p-; P=. 001) and to a higher number of abnormalities (≥ 2; P=. 001). The difference persists even if RS cases were excluded. Conclusions. FISH on TMAs is a reproducible and a feasible tool for the evaluation of cytogenetic abnormalities in CLL allowing for a decreased both time consumption and experimental variability. The incidence of cytogenetic abnormalities in our series resembles that of historical series with exception of 14 q translocation and 17 p- possibly due to a higher number of patients with resistant or progressive disease. The higher occurrence of unfavourable cytogenetic features in PC-rich lymph nodes suggest that PCs may be sites where, due to an antigenic stimuli, B cells are induced to proliferate thus conferring genetic instability. Further studies will clarify if cytogenetic abnormalities occurring in lymph-node and bone marrow PCs precede their appearance in the peripheral blood thus supporting the idea that at tissue level PC is crucial for triggering clonal proliferation nourishing the accumulation compartment...|$|R
40|$|Mitotic {{death is}} a delayed {{response}} of p 53 mutant tumours that are resistant to genotoxic damage. Questions surround why this response is so delayed and how its mechanisms serve a survival function. After uncoupling apoptosis from G 1 and S phase arrests and adapting these checkpoints, p 53 mutated tumour cells arrive at the G 2 compartment where decisions regarding survival and death are made. Missed or insufficient DNA repair in G 1 and S phases after severe genotoxic damage results in cells arriving in G 2 with an accumulation of point mutations and chromosome breaks. Double strand breaks can be repaired by homologous recombination during G 2 arrest. However, cells with excessive <b>chromosome</b> <b>lesions</b> either directly bypass the G 2 /M checkpoint, starting endocycles from G 2 arrest, or are subsequently detected by the spindle checkpoint and present with the features of mitotic death. These complex features include apoptosis from metaphase and mitosis restitution, the latter of which can also facilitate transient endocycles, producing endopolyploid cells. The ability of cells to initiate endocycles during G 2 arrest and mitosis restitution most likely reflects their similar molecular environments, with down-regulated mitosis promoting factor activity. Resulting endocycling cells {{have the ability to}} repair damaged DNA, and although mostly reproductively dead, in some cases give rise to mitotic progeny. We conclude that the features of mitotic death do not simply represent aberrations of dying cells but are indicative of a switch to amitotic modes of cell survival that may provide additional mechanisms of genotoxic resistance...|$|R
40|$|FAB {{proposals}} for {{the diagnosis of}} AML-M 0 represent the formal recognition of a distinct entity which has been described {{over the past few}} years by several authors and called minimally differentiated acute myeloid leukemia. By definition, AML-M 0 includes acute leukemias which do not fit morphological and cytochemical criteria for the diagnosis of AML, and for which myeloid lineage assignment can be made by immunological assay showing positivity for MPO, CD 13, and CD 33 and negativity for lymphoid markers. Involvement of an early myeloid progenitor in the leukemic process is a possible theory hypothesized to explain the existence of such a form. Validity of this assumption has been based on the observation that AML-M 0 frequently bears 'stem cell' markers such as CD 34, HLA-DR, Tdt, CD 7, and promiscuous IgH/TCR gene rearrangements, which are thought to occur in uncommitted cells. Finally, AML-M 0 very frequently carries cytogenetic abnormalities common to MDS or secondary AML, such as - 5 / 5 q- or - 7 / 7 q- deletions and or complex karyotype. In our experience, AML-M 0 is also very often associated with the MDR phenotype, which in turn has been found strictly linked to 'stem cell' features, especially in MDS. These biological aspects, altogether, translate into a very unfavorable prognosis, confirming even from a clinical point of view that AML-M 0 is a distinct entity. In conclusion, 'stem cell' markers, MDR phenotype, complex <b>chromosome</b> <b>lesions,</b> frequent occurrence in elderly patients, and intrinsic chemoresistance characterize AML-M 0 and indicate the need for tailored treatments, possibly involving the use of MDR modulators and/or differentiating agents...|$|R
40|$|Micronuclei, comet and {{chromosome}} alterations assays are {{the most}} widely used biomarkers for determining the genotoxic damage in a population exposed to genotoxic chemicals. While chromosome alterations are an excellent biomarker to detect short- and long-term genotoxic effects, the comet assay only measures early biological effects, and furthermore it is unknown whether nuclear abnormalies, such as those measured in the micronucleus test, remain detectable long-term after an acute exposure. In our previous study, an increase in structural chromosome alterations in fishermen involved in the clean-up of the Prestige oil spill, two years after acute exposure, was detected. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate whether, in lymphocytes from peripheral blood, the nuclear abnormalies (micronucleus, nucleoplasmic bridges and nuclear buds) have a similar sensitivity to the chromosome damage analysis for genotoxic detection two years after oil exposure in the same non-smoker individuals and in the same peripheral blood extraction.

However, chromosome damage, in the same individuals, was higher in exposed vs. non-exposed individuals, especially for <b>chromosome</b> <b>lesions</b> (p < 0. 05). These findings, despite the small sample size, suggest that nuclear abnormalities are probably less-successful biomarkers than are chromosome alterations to evaluate genotoxic effects two or more years after an exposure to oil.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Fourteen cases of MZBCL diagnosed according to the REAL classification were studied by conventional chromosome analysis (CCA) and by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using the following probes: 3 q 27 /BCL 6, 6 q 21, 7 q 31, 9 p 21 /p 16, 11 q 22 /ATM, 13 q 14, 17 p 13, centromeres of # 3, # 7, # 12. Pertinent clinical data were collected. RESULTS: Primary disease presentation consisted of histologically documented splenic MZBCL in 9 cases, nodal MZBCL in 3 cases and extra-nodal MZBCL in 2 cases. Four cases showed evolution into a high-grade lymphoma, due to the presence of a predominant large cell or blast cell component. Clonal karyotype anomalies were detected by CCA in 12 cases, 6 of which had a complex karyotype, including all 4 cases with high-grade histology. Interphase FISH confirmed cytogenetic data and revealed several cryptic chromosomal lesions. Overall, total/partial + 12 was found in five cases; 13 q 14 and 17 p 13 deletion were found in four cases each; + 3, 7 q 31 deletion and a BCL 6 split signal were found in three cases; deletions at 6 q 21 and 11 q 22. 3 in two cases each; + 7 and a 9 p 21 deletion were found in one case each.

40|$|Centromeres form {{specialized}} chromatin structures termed kinetochores {{which are}} required for accurate segregation of <b>chromosomes.</b> DNA <b>lesions</b> might disrupt protein-DNA interactions, thereby compromising segregation and genome stability. We show that yeast centromeres are heavily resistant to removal of UV-induced DNA lesions by two different repair systems, photolyase and nucleotide excision repair. Repair resistance persists in G 1 - and G 2 /M-arrested cells. Efficient repair was obtained only by disruption of the kinetochore structure in a ndc 10 - 1 mutant, but not in cse 4 - 1 and cbf 1 Δ mutants. Moreover, UV photofootprinting and DNA repair footprinting showed that centromere proteins cover about 120 bp of the centromere elements CDEII and CDEIII, including 20 bp of flanking CDEIII. Thus, DNA lesions {{do not appear to}} disrupt protein-DNA interactions in the centromere. Maintaining a stable kinetochore structure seems to be more important for the cell than immediate removal of DNA lesions.

In 131 patients (42 present series plus 89 in the literature) secondary chromosome aberrations seen by conventional cytogenetic analysis in more than 5 cases included deletions/translocations (del/t) 6 q 15 - 23 [15 cases]; - 13 [14 cases]; del/t 1 p 21 - 31 [12 cases]; + 3 q [11 cases]; del/t 17 p [9 cases]; 8 p translocations and del(Y) [8 cases each]; - 20 [7 cases]; 13 q 14 deletion, del/t 11 q 22 - 23, del/t 9 q, del(10) (q 22 q 24), - 20, - 21, - 22 and -X [6 cases each]. We arrived at the following conclusions: i) though no secondary anomaly is specific for MCL, there is a distinct profile of recurrent <b>chromosome</b> <b>lesions</b> in MCL with 1 p 21 - 31 deletions, 8 p translocations, 11 q 22 - 23 anomalies having a strong association with CD 5 + B-cell lymphomas of low-to-intermediate grade histology; ii) FISH enabled the detection of cryptic chromosome 12, 13 q and 17 p rearrangements in a sizeable fraction of cases; iii) 9 p 21 /p 16 deletions did not occur at a high incidence in this series, possibly because of the low number of cases with blastoid variant...|$|R
40|$|A mutator, mu 2 (a), in Drosophila melanogaster potentiates {{terminal}} deficiencies. In {{the female}} germ line the y mutant frequency induced by irradiation of mature oocytes with 5 Gy increases approximately twofold in heterozygotes and 20 -fold in homozygotes compared with wild type. The recovery of terminal deficiencies {{is not limited}} to breaks close to chromosome ends; high frequencies of deficiencies can be recovered with breakpoints located in centric heterochromatin or near the middle of a <b>chromosome</b> arm. <b>Lesions</b> induced by γ-rays are repaired slowly in mu 2 (a) oocytes, but become ``fixed'' as terminal deficiencies upon fertilization. A few lesions induced in wild-type females also produce terminal deficiencies. Mutator males do not exhibit an increase in terminal deletions, regardless of the germ cell stage irradiated. In addition, there is no increase in the mutant frequency when mature sperm are irradiated and fertilize eggs produced by mu 2 (a) females. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that lesions induced in sperm chromosomes are repaired after fertilization, while lesions induced in oocyte chromosomes are shunted instead to a mechanism that stabilizes broken chromosome ends. We propose that mu 2 affects chromosomal structure during oogenesis, thereby modulating DNA repair...|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} study on stored lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) seeds we showed that loss of seed {{viability}} is associated with an accumulation ofchromosome damage in the surviving seeds (see Rao et al. 1987). Like many other previous investigators we evaluated the chromosome damage in the primary roots by examining the anaphase cells of the first mitotic divisions where the <b>chromosomes</b> containing <b>lesions</b> induced uring storage form visible aberration configurations. Aberrant cells containing ross chromosome damage were however shown to be removed subsequently b diplontic selection since they occasion mechanical separation problems during divisions and produce daughter cells which are genetically imbalanced. Structural changes in the chromosomes involving rearrangement of segments such as translocations and inversions, however, do not form aberrant configurations in mitotic ells, hence they are not subjected to selection, and survive through successive c ll generations to become visible only at meiosis. As is well known, translocations and inversion heterozygotes produce gametes containing duplica tions and deficiencies which, as a result are inviable and cause considerable sterility in the plants carrying them. Also small deficiencies may escape diplontic selection and survive up to meio sis and induce sterility since, being haploid, the gametophyte is extremely sensitive to even smal...|$|R
40|$|SummaryIn {{response}} to DNA damage, cells activate checkpoint signaling cascades to control cell-cycle progression and elicit DNA repair {{in order to}} maintain genomic integrity. The sensing and repair of lesions is critical for Bacillus subtilis cells entering the developmental process of sporulation as damaged DNA may prevent the cells from completing spore morphogenesis. We report the identification of the protein DisA (DNA integrity scanning protein, annotated YacK), which is required to delay the initiation of sporulation in {{response to}} chromosomal damage. DisA is a nonspecific DNA binding protein that forms a single focus, which moves rapidly within the bacterial cell, pausing at sites of DNA damage. We propose that the DisA focus scans along the <b>chromosomes</b> searching for <b>lesions.</b> Upon encountering a lesion, DisA delays entry into sporulation until the damage is repaired...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the identification and}} characterization of two genes and their gene products responsible for determining receptor binding and pilus length in type 1 -piliated Escherichia coli. One gene, pilE, conferred the ability of piliated cells to agglutinate guinea pig erythrocytes. The other gene, pilF, determined pilus length, in that mutants having lesions in pilF had very long pili. The two genes were detected after Tn 5 mutagenesis of a cloned segment of DNA that normally complemented a pilE <b>lesion</b> in the <b>chromosome.</b> Thus, <b>lesions</b> in pilE or pilF on the cloned segment resulted in mutants having the PilE- phenotype (piliated but unable to agglutinate erythrocytes). Introduction of the plasmid-encoded mutant alleles of pilE and pilF into the chromosome followed by electron microscopic examination of the mutants showed that only lesions in pilF conferred the striking increase in pilus length. Mutations in pilF could be complemented in trans by the original cloned segment to produce cells with parental-length pili. Minicell transcription and translation of the cloned pilE and pilF genes having representative Tn 5 insertion mutations showed that the pilE gene product was a protein of ca. 31 kilodaltons and that the pilF gene product was a protein of ca. 18 kilodaltons. We believe that the pilF gene product may act as a competitive inhibitor of pilus polymerization. Thus, pilus length may be controlled by the ratio of pilin to pilF gene product present within the cell...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} RecN protein is {{recruited}} to a defined DNA double strand break (DSB) in Bacillus subtilis cells {{at an early}} time point during repair. Because RecO and RecF are successively recruited to DSBs, {{it is now clear}} that dynamic DSB repair centers (RCs) exist in prokaryotes. RecA protein was also recruited to RCs and formed highly dynamic filamentous structures, which we term threads, across the nucleoids. Formation of RecA threads commenced ∼ 30 min after the induction of DSBs, after RecN recruitment to RCs, and disassembled after 2 h. Time-lapse microscopy showed that the threads rapidly changed in length, shape, and orientation within minutes and can extend at 1. 02 μm/min. The formation of RecA threads was abolished in recJ addAB mutant cells but not in each of the single mutants, suggesting that RecA filaments can be initiated via two pathways. Contrary to proteins forming RCs, DNA polymerase I did not form foci but was present throughout the nucleoids (even after induction of DSBs or after UV irradiation), suggesting that it continuously scans the <b>chromosome</b> for DNA <b>lesions...</b>|$|R

40|$|In vertebrates, ATM and ATR are {{critical}} regulators of checkpoint responses to damaged and incompletely replicated DNA. These checkpoint responses involve the activation of signaling pathways that inhibit the replication of <b>chromosomes</b> with DNA <b>lesions.</b> In this study, {{we describe the}} isolation of a cDNA encoding a full-length version of Xenopus ATM. Using antibodies against the regulatory domain of ATM, we have identified the essential replication protein Mcm 2 as an ATM-binding protein in Xenopus egg extracts. Xenopus Mcm 2 underwent phosphorylation at Ser 92 {{in response to the}} presence of double-stranded DNA breaks or DNA replication blocks in egg extracts. This phosphorylation involved both ATM and ATR, but the relative contribution of each kinase depended upon the checkpoint-inducing DNA signal. Furthermore, both ATM and ATR phosphorylated Mcm 2 directly at Ser 92 in cell-free kinase assays. Immunodepletion of both ATM and ATR abrogated the checkpoint response that blocks chromosomal DNA replication in egg extracts containing double-stranded DNA breaks. These experiments indicate that ATM and ATR phosphorylate the functionally critical replication protein Mcm 2 during both DNA damage and replication checkpoint responses in Xenopus egg extracts...|$|R
40|$|UV light {{produces}} lesions, predominantly pyrimidine dimers, which inhibit DNA replication in mammalian cells. The {{mechanism of}} inhibition is controversial: is synthesis {{of a daughter}} strand halted at a lesion while the replication fork moves on and reinitiates downstream, or is fork progression itself blocked for some time {{at the site of}} a lesion? We directly addressed this question by using electron microscopy to examine the distances of replication forks from the origin in unirradiated and UV-irradiated simian virus 40 <b>chromosomes.</b> If UV <b>lesions</b> block replication fork progression, the forks should be asymmetrically located in a large fraction of the irradiated molecules; if replication forks move rapidly past lesions, the forks should be symmetrically located. A large fraction of the simian virus 40 replication forks in irradiated molecules were asymmetrically located, demonstrating that UV lesions present at the frequency of pyrimidine dimers block replication forks. As a mechanism for this fork blockage, we propose that polymerization of the leading strand makes a significant contribution to the energetics of fork movement, so any lesion in the template for the leading strand which blocks polymerization should also block fork movement...|$|R
40|$|Primary mediastinal B-Cell {{lymphoma}} (PMBL) is {{a recently}} defined entity comprising ~ 2 - 10 % non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). Unlike most NHL subtypes, PMBL lacks recurrent gene rearrangements {{to serve as}} biomarkers or betray target genes. While druggable, late chemotherapeutic complications warrant the search for new targets and models. Well characterized tumor cell lines provide unlimited material to serve as preclinical resources for verifiable analyses directed at the discovery of new biomarkers and pathological targets using high throughput microarray technologies. The same cells may then be used to seek intelligent therapies directed at clinically validated targets. Four cell lines have emerged as potential PMBL models: FARAGE, KARPAS- 1106 P, MEDB- 1 and U- 2940. Transcriptionally, PMBL cell lines cluster near c(lassical) -HL and B-NHL examples showing they are related but separate entities. Here we document genomic alterations therein, by cytogenetics and high density oligonucleotide/SNP microarrays and parse their impact by integrated global expression profiling. PMBL cell lines were distinguished by moderate chromosome rearrangement levels undercutting cHL, while lacking oncogene translocations seen in B-NHL. In total 61 deletions were shared by two or more cell lines, together with 12 amplifications (≥ 4 x) and 72 homozygous regions. Integrated genomic and transcriptional profiling showed deletions {{to be the most}} important class of <b>chromosome</b> rearrangement. <b>Lesions</b> were mapped to several loci associated with PMBL, e. g. 2 p 15 (REL/COMMD 1), 9 p 24 (JAK 2, CD 274), 16 p 13 (SOCS 1, LITAF, CIITA); plus new or tenuously associated loci: 2 p 16 (MSH 6), 6 q 23 (TNFAIP 3), 9 p 22 (CDKN 2 A/B), 20 p 12 (PTPN 1). Discrete homozygous regions sometimes substituted focal deletions accompanied by gene silencing implying a role for epigenetic or mutational inactivation. Genomic amplifications increasing gene expression or gene-activating rearrangements were respectively rare or absent. Our findings highlight biallelic deletions as a major class of chromosomal lesion in PMBL cell lines, while endorsing the latter as preclinical models for hunting and testing new biomarkers and actionable targets...|$|R
25|$|Targeted therapies are a {{relatively}} new class of cancer drugs that can overcome {{many of the issues}} seen with the use of cytotoxics. They are divided into two groups: small molecule and antibodies. The massive toxicity seen with the use of cytotoxics is {{due to the lack of}} cell specificity of the drugs. They will kill any rapidly dividing cell, tumor or normal. Targeted therapies are designed to affect cellular proteins or processes that are utilised by the cancer cells. This allows a high dose to cancer tissues with {{a relatively}} low dose to other tissues. As different proteins are utilised by different cancer types, the targeted therapy drugs are used on a cancer type specific, or even on a patient specific basis. Although the side effects are often less severe than that seen of cytotoxic chemotherapeutics, life-threatening effects can occur. Initially, the targeted therapeutics were supposed to be solely selective for one protein. Now it is clear that there is often a range of protein targets that the drug can bind. An example target for targeted therapy is the protein produced by the Philadelphia <b>chromosome,</b> a genetic <b>lesion</b> found commonly in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. This fusion protein has enzyme activity that can be inhibited by imatinib, a small molecule drug.|$|R
