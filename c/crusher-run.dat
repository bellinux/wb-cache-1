40|$|AbstractWhile cutting asphalt {{pavement}} surfaces, cooling water is continuously {{given to the}} cutting machine blades to prevent the heat increase and to control the scatter of cutting dusts. As the results, {{asphalt pavement}} cutting waste water is generated. The amount of waste water generated at one construction site {{is by no means}} a lot, however, the water quality is not environmentally friendly. In view of above, the physical and chemical properties of cutting waste water were first investigated. Then the possibility of effective use of the cutting waste water was investigated using flocculants and granulation technique. The results show that the waste water quality can be improved by the effects of flocculants. Mud sediments after flocculated in the waste water can be granulated and the granules may be used as recycled sands or recycle <b>crusher-runs</b> aggregates...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThere is a {{significant}} amount of wastes during the reconstruction and overhaul of hydraulic structures such as crushed reinforced concrete frames. The wastes must be disposed afterwards which leads to a substantial increase in costs. To use the waste products there must be appropriate comprehensive study and science technical justification. On the basis of the proposed solutions, recommended practice for the use of <b>crusher-run</b> aggregates of reinforced concrete frames when reconstructing hydraulic structures has been developed. To study the possibility and feasibility of using recycled rubble solutions for the reconstruction of the overflow dam have been developed. The authors proposed justification and design solutions that allow using the dismantling products in the elements of spillway structures by applying macroporous concrete...|$|E
40|$|The {{extensively}} used AASHTO {{structural design}} procedures for flexible pavement indicate the required pavement design {{in terms of}} a structural number. For a particular pavement thickness design, this structural number can be computed from the sum of each pavement layer's thickness multiplied by its strength parameter, called the structural layer coefficient. The research work reported herein presents methods for determining the structural layer coefficients for asphalt emulsion-aggregate mixtures. A hot plant-mixed asphaltic concrete was evaluated for structural layer coefficient, and the radial stress vs. fatigue failure relationship was developed using circular specimens and the Jimenez deflectometer. Relationships between structural number and load repetitions to failure for different loading conditions were developed. These relationships were used to evaluate the structural numbers of other specimens when tested to failure in flexural fatigue. Three asphalt emulsion-aggregate mixtures were designed using CSS-lh asphalt emulsion. The aggregates used for the three mixtures were: (1) Type I aggregate using dense-graded, crushed, river gravel; (2) Type II aggregate using pit-run, coarse sand; and (3) Type III aggregate using a silty sand. These mixtures were evaluated for Marshall stability, Hveem stability and cohesiometer value, unconfined compressive strength, double punch tensile strength and dynamic modulus of elasticity at various ages from 3 to 28 days. Flexural fatigue life, when tested in the deflectometer, was determined for all mixtures at 7 and 28 days. Structural numbers for the specimens and structural layer coefficients for the mixtures were determined. Relationships were developed between the evaluation tests performed and the structural layer coefficients at various mixture ages by using test results from the three mixtures and a regression analysis procedure. A fourth asphalt emulsion-aggregate mixture using CSS-lh asphalt emulsion and a Type II <b>crusher-run</b> aggregate was designed. Evaluation tests were performed at 3 and 7 days and layer coefficients for the mixture were predicted for 7 and 28 days using the regression equations developed. Layer coefficients at 7 and 28 days were also determined by testing specimens in fatigue in the deflectometer and computing their structural numbers and layer coefficients. Layer coefficients determined in these two manners indicated favorable comparisons. The results of this research provides information about the structural layer coefficients for asphalt emulsion-aggregate mixtures. The relationships between the evaluation tests and structural layer coefficient can be used for determining layer coefficients for other asphalt emulsion-aggregate mixtures. Because the evaluation tests used were tests commonly performed in most asphalt laboratories, these determinations can be made without the necessity of additional equipment or procedures in most cases...|$|E
