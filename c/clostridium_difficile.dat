5|$|Many of {{the same}} agents cause {{gastroenteritis}} in cats and dogs as in humans. The most common organisms are Campylobacter, <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile,</b> Clostridium perfringens, and Salmonella. A large number of toxic plants may also cause symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Pseudomembranous colitis is a {{potentially}} lethal condition {{commonly associated with}} clindamycin, but which occurs with other antibiotics, as well. Overgrowth of <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile,</b> which is inherently resistant to clindamycin, results {{in the production of}} a toxin that causes a range of adverse effects, from diarrhea to colitis and toxic megacolon.|$|E
5|$|Common {{side effects}} include nausea, diarrhea, rash, and pain {{at the site}} of injection. It {{increases}} the risk of hospital-acquired <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> colitis about fourfold. Other antibiotics may be recommended instead due to this reason. It appears to be generally safe in pregnancy. It is of the lincosamide class and works by blocking bacteria from making protein.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> {{infection}} (CDI) is a symptomatic infection {{due to the}} spore-forming bacterium, <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile.</b> Symptoms include watery diarrhea, fever, nausea, and abdominal pain. It {{makes up}} about 20% of cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Complications may include pseudomembranous colitis, toxic megacolon, perforation of the colon, and sepsis.|$|E
25|$|In the elderly, {{particularly}} {{those who have been}} treated with antibiotics for unrelated infections, a toxin produced by <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> often causes severe diarrhea.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> is {{the most}} common cause of Antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and the {{resulting}} C. difficile mediated infection (CDI) is potentially deadly. C. difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) is manifested by severe inflammation and colitis, mostly due to the release of two exotoxins by C. difficile that cause destruction of epithelial cells in the intestine. The study “Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus B-30892 can inhibit cytotoxic effects and adhesion of pathogenic <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> to Caco-2 cells“ demonstrates that L. bulgaricus can reduce the colonization of C. difficile cells in colorectal cells, and thus prevent Antibiotic Associated Diarrhea.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile,</b> an {{anaerobic}} bacterium, is a {{major cause}} of potentially life-threatening disease, including nosocomial diarrheal infections, especially in developed countries. C. difficile endospores can survive for up to five months on surfaces. The pathogen is frequently transmitted by the hands of healthcare workers in hospital environments. C. difficile is currently a leading hospital-acquired infection in the UK, and rivals MRSA as the most common organism to cause hospital acquired infections in the US It is responsible for a series of intestinal health complications, often referred to collectively as <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> Associated Disease (CDAD).|$|E
25|$|Compared to a {{flush toilet}} being flushed without closing its lid, a UDDT {{would have a}} lower risk of <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> {{spreading}} via aerosolization, as it does not involve turbulent water.|$|E
25|$|Occasionally, {{patients}} have developed cholestatic hepatitis or delirium. Accidental intravenous overdose in an infant caused severe heart block, resulting in residual encephalopathy. <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> {{has been reported}} with use of azithromycin.|$|E
25|$|Pathogenic C. difficile strains produce {{multiple}} toxins. The most well-characterized are enterotoxin (<b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> toxin A) and cytotoxin (<b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> toxin B), both {{of which}} may produce diarrhea and inflammation in infected patients, although their relative contributions have been debated. Toxins A and B are glucosyltransferases that target and inactivate the Rho family of GTPases. Toxin B (cytotoxin) induces actin depolymerization by a mechanism correlated with {{a decrease in the}} ADP-ribosylation of the low molecular mass GTP-binding Rho proteins. Another toxin, binary toxin, also has been described, but its role in disease is not fully understood.|$|E
25|$|Administration of {{levofloxacin}} {{or other}} broad spectrum antibiotics {{is associated with}} <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> associated diarrhea which may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Fluoroquinoline administration {{may be associated with}} the acquisition and outgrowth of a particularly virulent Clostridium strain.|$|E
25|$|To {{minimise}} {{the risks}} associated with splenectomy, antibiotic and vaccination protocols have been established, but are often poorly adhered to by physicians and patients due to the complications resulting from antibiotic prophylaxis such as development of an overpopulation of <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> in the intestinal tract.|$|E
25|$|If defined {{strictly}} {{as having}} local effect, the topical {{route of administration}} can also include enteral administration of medications that are poorly absorbable by the gastrointestinal tract. One poorly absorbable antibiotic is vancomycin, which is recommended by mouth {{as a treatment for}} severe <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> colitis.|$|E
25|$|Flagyl (metronidazole) is a {{nitroimidazole}} antibiotic medication used {{particularly for}} anaerobic bacteria and protozoa. It is antibacterial against anaerobic organisms, an amoebicide, and an antiprotozoal. It is the {{drug of choice}} for first episodes of mild-to-moderate <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> infection. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{antibiotic}} therapy for less-severe <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> colitis (pseudomembranous colitis) consists of oral metronidazole or oral vancomycin. Several randomized controlled trials have demonstrated equivalent efficacy of oral metronidazole and oral vancomycin in treating this colitis. However, oral vancomycin {{is shown to}} be more effective in treating patients with severe C. difficile colitis.|$|E
25|$|Therapy {{for older}} {{children}} and adults generally includes treatment for atypical bacteria: typically a macrolide antibiotic (such as azithromycin or clarithromycin) or a quinolone, such as levofloxacin. Doxycycline is the antibiotic of choice in the UK for atypical bacteria, due to increased <b>clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> colitis in hospital patients linked to {{the increased use of}} clarithromycin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> colitis {{may occur}} in {{connection}} with the use of any antibacterial drug, especially those with a broad spectrum of activity such as clindamycin, cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones. Fluoroquinoline treatment is associated with risk that is similar to or less than that associated with broad spectrum cephalosporins. Fluoroquinoline administration may be associated with the acquisition and outgrowth of a particularly virulent Clostridium strain.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include nausea, vomiting, headaches, and {{increased}} intestinal gas. Serious side effects may include <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> colitis, {{an increased risk}} of pneumonia, {{an increased risk of}} bone fractures, and the potential of masking stomach cancer. It is unclear if it is safe for use in pregnancy. Omeprazole is a proton-pump inhibitor and as such blocks the release of stomach acid.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} danger to humans is from diseases rats can transmit. City-dwelling rats carry pathogens {{that can cause}} diarrhea and vomiting in humans. Disease-causing bacteria commonly carried by rats include E. coli, <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> (C. diff), and Salmonella. The bacteria can be spread by contact with rat feces, saliva, or urine. Viral diseases spread by rats include rat-bite fever and hemorrhagic fevers caused by Seoul hantavirus.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include nausea, vomiting, {{diarrhea}} and upset stomach. An allergic reaction or {{a type of}} diarrhea caused by <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> is possible. No harm has been found with its use during pregnancy. Its safety during breastfeeding is not confirmed, but it is likely safe. Azithromycin is an azalide, a type of macrolide antibiotic. It works by decreasing the production of protein, thus stopping bacterial growth.|$|E
25|$|Copper alloy {{surfaces}} have intrinsic {{properties to}} destroy {{a wide range of}} microorganisms. In the interest of protecting public health, especially in healthcare environments with their susceptible patient populations, an abundance of peer-reviewed antimicrobial efficiency studies have been and continue to be conducted around the world regarding copper's efficiency to destroy , methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus, <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile,</b> influenza A virus, adenovirus, and fungi.|$|E
25|$|Vancomycin is an {{antibiotic}} {{used to treat}} a number of bacterial infections. It is recommended intravenously {{as a treatment for}} complicated skin infections, bloodstream infections, endocarditis, bone and joint infections, and meningitis caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Blood levels may be measured to determine the correct dose. Vancomycin is also recommended by mouth as a treatment for severe <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> colitis. When taken by mouth it is very poorly absorbed.|$|E
25|$|Metronidazole (MNZ), marketed {{under the}} brand name Flagyl among others, is an {{antibiotic}} and antiprotozoal medication. It is used either alone or with other antibiotics to treat pelvic inflammatory disease, endocarditis, and bacterial vaginosis. It is effective for dracunculiasis, giardiasis, trichomoniasis, and amebiasis. It is the drug of choice for a first episode of mild-to-moderate <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> colitis. Metronidazole is available by mouth, as a cream, and intravenously.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> {{infection}} is spread by bacterial spores found within feces. Surfaces may become contaminated with the spores with further spread occurring via {{the hands of}} healthcare workers. Risk factors for infection include antibiotic or proton pump inhibitors use, hospitalization, other health problems, and older age. Diagnosis is by stool culture or testing for the bacteria's DNA or toxins. If a person tests positive but has no symptoms it is known as C. difficile colonization rather than an infection.|$|E
25|$|Fecal bacteriotherapy, {{also known}} as a stool transplant, is {{approximately}} 85% to 90% effective in those for whom antibiotics have not worked. It involves infusion of bacterial flora acquired from the feces of a healthy donor to reverse the bacterial imbalance responsible for the recurring nature of the infection. The procedure replaces normal, healthy colonic flora that had been wiped out by antibiotics, and re-establishes resistance to colonization by <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile.</b> Side effects, at least initially, are few.|$|E
25|$|Vancomycin by {{mouth is}} {{preferred}} for severe disease. Additionally, vancomycin {{may be used}} to treat mild-to-moderate disease if diarrhea persists after a course of metronidazole. Since metronidazole has the potential to cause birth defects, pregnant women with <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> infection may be treated with vancomycin regardless of disease severity. Vancomycin may be more effective than metronidazole. Typical vancomycin dosage is taken four times daily for 10 days. Vancomyin may be given rectally if the person develops an ileus and cannot take medications by mouth.|$|E
25|$|Both {{infectious}} and non-infectious {{causes for}} colitis exist. In the adult horse, Salmonella, <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile,</b> and Neorickettsia risticii (the causative agent of Potomac Horse Fever) are common causes of colitis. Antibiotics, which {{may lead to}} an altered and unhealthy microbiota, sand, grain overload, and toxins such as arsenic and cantharidin {{can also lead to}} colitis. Unfortunately, only 20–30% of acute colitis cases are able to be definitively diagnosed. NSAIDs can cause slower-onset of colitis, usually in the right dorsal colon (see Right dorsal colitis).|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include {{abdominal}} cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea. More {{serious side effects}} may include <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> colitis, liver problems, prolonged QT, and allergic reactions. It is generally safe in those who are allergic to penicillin. Erythromycin {{also appears to be}} safe to use during pregnancy. While generally regarded as safe during breastfeeding its use by the mother during {{the first two weeks of}} life may increase the risk of pyloric stenosis in the baby. This risk also applies if taken directly by the baby during this age. It is in the macrolide family and works by decreasing bacterial protein production.|$|E
25|$|Diseases {{that affect}} the large {{intestine}} may affect it {{in whole or in}} part. Appendicitis is one such disease, caused by inflammation of the appendix. Generalised inflammation of the large intestine is referred to as colitis, which when caused be the bacteria <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> is referred to as pseudomembranous colitis. Diverticulitis is a common cause of abdominal pain resulting from outpouchings that particularly affects the colon. Functional colonic diseases refer to disorders without a known cause, and include irritable bowel syndrome and intestinal pseudoobstruction. Constipation may result from lifestyle factors, impaction of a rigid stool in the rectum, or in neonates, Hirschprung's disease.|$|E
25|$|New York City rats carry {{pathogens}} {{that can}} cause diarrhea, vomiting, and fever in humans, especially in children. The pathogens they carry include bacteria such as <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> (C. diff), Salmonella, E. coli, and Leptospira. Bartonella bacteria cause cat scratch disease, trench fever, and Carron disease. These bacteria may be spread through contact with rat feces, saliva, or urine. Rats can carry disease-causing viruses such as sapoviruses, cardioviruses, kobuviruses, parechoviruses, rotaviruses, hepaciviruses, and Seoul virus. Rats carry fleas that are vectors of diseases such as bubonic plague, typhus, and spotted fever. In addition, some people have an allergic reaction {{to the presence of}} rodent feces, hair, or urine.|$|E
25|$|Copper alloy {{surfaces}} have intrinsic {{properties to}} destroy {{a wide range of}} microorganisms. In the interest of protecting public health, especially in healthcare environments with their susceptible patient populations, an abundance of peer-reviewed antimicrobial efficacy studies have been conducted in the past 10 years regarding copper's efficacy to destroy E. coli O157:H7, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus, <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile,</b> influenza A virus, adenovirus, and fungi. Stainless steel was also investigated because it is an important surface material in today's healthcare environments. The studies cited here, plus others directed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, resulted in the 2008 registration of 274 different copper alloys as certified antimicrobial materials that have public health benefits.|$|E
25|$|An {{innovation}} in antimicrobial surfaces is {{the discovery that}} copper and its alloys (brasses, bronzes, cupronickel, copper-nickel-zinc, and others) are natural antimicrobial materials that have intrinsic properties to destroy {{a wide range of}} microorganisms. An abundance of peer-reviewed antimicrobial efficacy studies have been published regarding copper’s efficacy to destroy E. coli O157:H7, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus, <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile,</b> influenza A virus, adenovirus, and fungi. For further information regarding efficacy studies, clinical studies (including U.S. Department of Defense clinical trials), United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) registrations with public health claims for 355 Antimicrobial Copper (Cu+) alloys, and a list of EPA-registered antimicrobial copper products, see: Antimicrobial copper touch surfaces and Antimicrobial properties of copper.|$|E
25|$|For {{control of}} staphylococcal infections in hospitals, {{it has been}} found that the {{greatest}} benefit from hand-cleansing came from the first 20% of washing, and that very little additional benefit was gained when hand cleansing frequency was increased beyond 35%. Washing with plain soap results in more than triple the rate of bacterial infectious disease transmitted to food as compared to washing with antibacterial soap. Comparing hand-rubbing with alcohol-based solution with hand washing with antibacterial soap for a median time of 30 seconds each showed that the alcohol hand-rubbing reduced bacterial contamination 26% more than the antibacterial soap. But soap and water is more effective than alcohol-based hand rubs for reducing H1N1 influenza A virus and <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> spores from hands.|$|E
25|$|William Parker, Randy Bollinger, {{and colleagues}} at Duke University {{proposed}} in 2007 that the appendix serves as a haven for useful bacteria when illness flushes those bacteria {{from the rest of}} the intestines. This proposal is based on an understanding that emerged by the early 2000s of how the immune system supports the growth of beneficial intestinal bacteria, in combination with many well-known features of the appendix, including its architecture, its location just below the normal one-way flow of food and germs in the large intestine, and its association with copious amounts of immune tissue. Research performed at Winthrop–University Hospital showed that individuals without an appendix were four times more likely to have a recurrence of <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> colitis. The appendix, therefore, may act as a safe house for good bacteria. This reservoir of bacteria could then serve to repopulate the gut flora in the digestive system following a bout of dysentery or cholera, or boost it following a milder gastrointestinal illness.|$|E
25|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{efficacy of}} various copper alloys against <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> was recently evaluated. The viability of C. difficile spores and vegetative cells were studied on copper alloys C11000 (99.9% copper), C51000 (95% copper), C70600 (90% copper), C26000 (70% copper), and C75200 (65% copper). Stainless steel (S30400) {{was used as}} the experimental control. The copper alloys significantly reduced the viability of both C. difficile spores and vegetative cells. On C75200, near total kill was observed after one hour (however, at 6 hours total C. difficile increased, and decreased slower afterwards). On C11000 and C51000, near total kill was observed after 3 hours, then total kill in 24 hours on C11000 and 48 hours on C51000. On C70600, near total kill was observed after 5 hours. On C26000, near total kill was achieved after 48 hours. On stainless steel, no reductions in viable organisms were observed after 72 hours (3 days) of exposure and no significant reduction was observed within 168 hours (1 week).|$|E
500|$|Toxigenic <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile</b> is an {{important}} cause of diarrhea that occurs more often in the elderly. Infants can carry these bacteria without developing symptoms. It is a common cause of diarrhea in those who are hospitalized and is frequently associated with antibiotic use. Staphylococcus aureus infectious diarrhea may also occur in those who have used antibiotics. Acute [...] "traveler's diarrhea" [...] is usually a type of bacterial gastroenteritis, while the persistent form is usually parasitic. Acid-suppressing medication appears to {{increase the risk of}} significant infection after exposure to a number of organisms, including <b>Clostridium</b> <b>difficile,</b> Salmonella, and Campylobacter species. The risk is greater in those taking proton pump inhibitors than with H2 antagonists.|$|E
