In our previous work, we proposed the quadratic Wasserstein metric (W_ 2) as a new misfit function for FWI. The W_ 2 metric has been proved to have many ideal properties with regards to convexity and insensitivity to noise. When the observed and predicted seismic data are regarded as two density functions, the quadratic Wasserstein metric corresponds to the optimal cost of rearranging one density into the other, where the transportation cost is quadratic in distance. The difficulty of transforming seismic signals into nonnegative density functions is discussed. Unlike the L^ 2 norm, W_ 2 measures not only amplitude differences, but also global phase shifts, which helps to avoid <b>cycle</b> <b>skipping</b> issues. In this work, we build on our earlier method to cover more realistic high-resolution applications by embedding the W_ 2 technique into the framework of the adjoint-state method and applying it to seismic relevant 2 D examples: the Camembert, the Marmousi, and the 2004 BP models. We propose a new way of using the W_ 2 metric trace-by-trace in FWI and compare it to global W_ 2 via the solution of the Monge-Ampère equation.

This X-linked mutation leads to an increased risk for premature ovarian failure; interestingly, the association of repeat size with risk is non-linear. We hypothesize that the premutation-associated ovarian insuffi-ciency is due to a diminished oocyte pool and examined reproductive aging milestones by repeat size group to deter-mine if the same non-linear association is observed. METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional reproductive history questionnaire data from 948 women {{with a wide range of}} repeat sizes.

The measured shear wave velocity log may contain errors that are due to drilling conditions, mud invasion etc. It may also contain <b>cycle</b> <b>skips</b> and might contain a lot of missing data and information. It is because of the poor quality of this type of log that has often made well log analysis companies and log interpreters neglect the measured shear wave log and subsequently generate or create an estimated shear wave log which they use for interpretation and modelling to check how the amplitudes vary with increasing offsets, among other uses.

40|$|International audienceFull {{waveform}} inversion {{using the}} conventional L 2 distance {{to measure the}} misfit between seismograms is known to suffer from <b>cycle</b> <b>skipping.</b> An alternative strategy is proposed in this study, based on {{a measure of the}} misfit computed with an optimal transport distance. This measure allows to account for the lateral coherency of events within the seismograms, instead of considering each seismic trace independently, as is done generally in full waveform inversion. The computation of this optimal transport distance relies on a particular mathematical formulation allowing for the non-conservation of the total energy between seismograms. The numerical solution of the optimal transport problem is performed using proximal splitting techniques. Three synthetic case studies are investigated using this strategy: the Marmousi 2 model, the BP 2004 salt model, and the Chevron 2014 benchmark data. The results emphasize interesting properties of the optimal transport distance. The associated misfit function is less prone to <b>cycle</b> <b>skipping.</b> A workflow is designed to reconstruct accurately the salt structures in the BP 2004 model, starting from an initial model containing no information about these structures.

Using the same workflow, full waveform inversion based on the L 2 distance converges towards a local minimum. These results yield encouraging perspectives regarding the use of the optimal transport distance for full waveform inversion: the sensitivity to the accuracy of the initial model is reduced, the reconstruction of complex salt structure is made possible, the method is robust to noise, and the interpretation of seismic data dominated by reflections is enhanced...|$|E

40|$|Least-squares {{inversion}} of seismic arrivals can provide remarkably detailed {{models of the}} Earth's subsurface. However, <b>cycle</b> <b>skipping</b> associated with these oscillatory arrivals is the main cause for local minima in the least-squares objective function. Therefore, {{it is often difficult}} for descent methods to converge to the solution without an accurate initial large-scale velocity estimate. The low frequencies in the arrivals, needed to update the large-scale components in the velocity model, are usually unreliable or absent. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a multi-objective inversion scheme that uses the conventional least-squares functional along with an auxiliary data-domain objective. As the auxiliary objective effectively replaces the seismic arrivals by bumps, we call it the bump functional. The bump functional minimization can be made far less sensitive to <b>cycle</b> <b>skipping</b> and can deal with multiple arrivals in the data. However, it can only be used as an auxiliary objective since it usually does not provide a unique model after minimization even when the regularized-least-squares functional has a unique global minimum and hence a unique solution. The role of the bump functional during the multi-objective inversion is to guide the optimization towards the global minimum by pulling the trapped solution out of the local minima associated with the least-squares functional whenever necessary. The computational complexity of the bump functional is equivalent to that of the least-squares functional. In this paper, we describe various characteristics of the bump functional using simple and illustrative numerical examples. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-objective inversion scheme by considering more realistic examples.

40|$|Full-waveform {{inversion}} (FWI) is {{a technique}} that seeks to find a high-resolution high-fidelity model of the Earth's subsurface {{that is capable of}} matching individual seismic waveforms, within an original raw field dataset, trace by trace. The method begins from a best-guess starting model, which is then iteratively improved using a sequence of linearized local inversions to solve a fully non-linear problem. In principle, FWI can be used to recover any physical property that has an influence upon the seismic wavefield, but in practice the technique has been used predominantly to recover P-wave velocity, and this is the route that is followed here. Full-waveform tomographic techniques seek to determine a highly resolved quantitative model of the sub-surface that will ultimately be able to explain the entire seismic wavefield including those phases that conventional processing and migration seek to remove such as refracted arrivals. Although the underlying theory of FWI is well established, its practical application to 3 D land data, and especially to seismic data that have been acquired using vibrators, in a form that is effective and robust, is still a subject of intense research. In this study, 2 D and 3 D FWI techniques have been applied to a vibrator dataset from onshore Oman. Both the raw dataset and the subsurface model cause difficulties for FWI. In particular, the data are noisy, have weak early arrivals, are strongly elastic, and especially are lacking in low-frequency content. The Earth model appears to contain shallow low-velocity layers, and these compromise the use of first-arrival travel-time tomography for the generation of a starting velocity model. The 2 D results show good recovery of the shallow part of the velocity models. The results show a low-velocity layer that extends across the velocity model, but lacking in a high-resolution image due to the absence of the third dimension. The seismograms of the final inversion models give a good comparison with the field data and produce a reasonably high correlation coefficient compared to the starting model. An inversion scheme has been developed in this study in which only data from the shorter offsets are initially inverted since these represent the subset of the data that is not <b>cycle</b> <b>skipped.</b> The offset range is then gradually extended as the model improves. The final 3 D model contains a strongly developed low-velocity layer in the shallow section. The results from this inversion appear to match p-wave logs from a shallow drill hole, better flatten the gathers, and better stack and migrate the reflection data. The inversion scheme is generic, and should have applications to other similar difficult datasets. Imperial Users onl...|$|R

In addition, denitrification was efficiently conducted in the interior of the 'bio-pompons', which were formed by the attached growth of biomass on the fibrous packings, even though the bulk of the reactor was under constant aeration.

On average, 95 % of COD was removed within 2 h of aeration, while 57 % of total nitrogen was removed after a retention time of 4 - 8 h. | An 11 -litre sequencing batch reactor (SBR) filled with fibrous packing {{was found to be}} very effective for the removal of not only Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), but also nitrogen from synthetic wastewaters with 250 - 1034 mg/l of COD and 22 - 114 mg/l of nitrogen.
