5|$|Brigitte Boisselier (born 1956), {{also known}} as Brigitte Roehr, is a French chemist and Raëlian {{religious}} leader {{best known for her}} claim to have overseen the creation of the first human clone. A native of <b>Champagne-Ardenne,</b> she studied chemistry in France and the United States, earning two PhDs. From 1984 to 1997, she lived near Paris and worked as a research chemist and a sales manager for Air Liquide.

After her service as their scientific director was publicized, she lost her position with Air Liquide and focused on cloning full-time.|$|E
