Host-guest chemistry encompasses the idea of molecular recognition and interactions through noncovalent bonding. Noncovalent bonding is <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> <b>maintaining</b> the 3D structure of large molecules, such as proteins and is involved in many biological processes in which large molecules bind specifically but transiently to one another. There are four commonly mentioned types of non-covalent interactions: hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, van der Waals forces, and hydrophobic interactions.|$|E

50|$|ARHI {{influences}} {{also the}} cell cycle, specifically ARHI’s strong inhibition of the cyclin D1 promoter. Cyclin D1 {{is an essential}} protein in the cell’s progression from G1 to S phase, and its regulation by ARHI is <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> <b>maintaining</b> healthy cells. This is the mechanism by which ARHI inhibits cell growth and acts as a negative growth regulator. A loss of ARHI function could result in out-of-control cell growth and, in fact, cyclin D1 is often up-regulated in ovarian cancers and invasive breast carcinomas when ARHI {{is found to be}} down-regulated. When ARHI is introduced into cancer cells lacking this gene, many responses occur in addition to cyclin D1 down-regulation. These include induction of p21, activation of JNK, and reduced signaling through the Ras/MAP pathway. Thus, loss of any of these processes (arising from loss of ARHI) can lead to cancer.|$|E

50|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the 3-ring system, variations in the design have raised safety concerns. For example, the move to mini rings and mini risers caused riser failures on some designs until riser strength was improved. The failure of some manufacturers to include stiff riser inserts and other hard housing cable guides to allow the free movement of the cutaway cable when risers and webbing are twisted has caused difficulty in cutting away from malfunctions with riser twists or harness deformations. The tolerance in the manufacture of the fabric risers and their connection to the rings is <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> <b>maintaining</b> the mechanical advantage of the 3-ring system and this has been compromised in some designs. Reversed risers placing the rings under the risers has prevented the rings moving freely and releasing under some cutaway scenarios. Replacement of the Lolon-F coating with Teflon impregnated compounds has caused both cracking and cable stripping problems.|$|E
50|$|Agriculture is {{the field}} in science wherein it {{concerns}} with the different techniques of land cultivation, crop and livestock raising, or otherwise, farming. The Department of Agriculture (Philippines) (DA) is a government agency responsible {{for the development of}} the Philippine's agriculture by generating policies, investments, and support services which are significant in the local and export-oriented trade. In the Philippine Development Plan (PDP), Chapter 4: Competitive and Sustainable Agriculture and Fisheries Sector, both agriculture and fisheries sector provides the needs and raw materials for the market and surplus labor to the industry and service sectors. The focus for improvement would be to generate more opportunities of employments and increased income for the farmers which would encourage participation from them. Development of the agricultural sector is <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> <b>maintaining</b> an affordable price for food especially for the poor which, then, could be translated to inclusive growth and poverty reduction. Proceso J. Alcala is a former district representative and the recently appointed DA secretary by President Benigno Aquino III on 2010. He is considered the 'Father of Organic Agriculture' because of his work in the Organic Agricultural Act of 2010 (RA 10068).|$|E
50|$|Potassium spatial {{buffering}} {{that occurs}} in the retina is called potassium siphoning, where the Muller cell is the principal glial cell type. Muller cells have important role in retinal physiology. It maintains retinal cell metabolism and are <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> <b>maintaining</b> potassium homeostasis in extracellular space during neuronal activity. Like cells responsible for spatial buffering, Muller cells are distinctively permeable to potassium ions through Kir channels. Like other glial cells, the high selectivity of Muller cell membranes to potassium ions {{is due to the}} high density of Kir channels. Potassium conductance is unevenly distributed in Muller cells. By focally increasing potassium ions along amphibian Muller cells and recording the resulting depolarization, the observed potassium conductance was concentrated in the endfoot process of 94% of the total potassium conductance localized to the small subcellular domain. The observation lead to hypothesis that excess potassium in extracellular space is “siphoned” by the Muller cells to the vitreous humor. Potassium siphoning is a specialized form of spatial buffering mechanisms where large reservoir of potassium ions is emptied into vitreous humor. Similar distribution pattern of Kir channels could be found in amphibians.|$|E

50|$|Dr. Arnaout’s {{research}} on the biology and structure of integrins has led to scientific observations that span the entire spectrum from gene discovery to 3-dimensional protein structure to clinical translation. He described an inherited deficiency in leukocyte adhesion in a lead article in the New England Journal of Medicine; defined the biochemical and molecular basis of this disease, which he traced to a deficiency {{in a family of}} leukocyte receptors, now known as leukocyte integrins and elucidated the role of these cell adhesion molecules in the immune system. He was also the first to determine the crystal structures of integrins. His molecular and structural studies in integrins were instrumental in understanding the processes involved in organ development, maintenance of organ architecture and homeostasis in the adult, cancer growth and metastasis, and the response of organs to acute and chronic inflammatory or autoimmune injury. For example, in the kidney, integrins are now known to be <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> <b>maintaining</b> the kidney filtration barrier thus preventing loss of blood and proteins in the urine, and also mediate the respiratory distress observed in kidney failure patients when hemodialyzed using cuprophane membranes. Arnaout's current research aims at translating his discoveries in integrin biology and structure into novel and safer drugs for treating inflammatory, thrombotic, fibrotic and autoimmune diseases and cancer, using structure-based drug design.|$|E
