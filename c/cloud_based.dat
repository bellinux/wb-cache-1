40|$|Stratiform clouds acquire {{charge at}} their {{upper and lower}} {{horizontal}} boundaries due to vertical current flow in the global electric circuit. Cloud charge is expected to influence microphysical processes, but understanding is restricted by the infrequent in situ measurements available. For stratiform <b>cloud</b> <b>bases</b> below 1 km in altitude, the <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> charge modifies the surface electric field beneath, allowing a new method of remote determination. Combining continuous cloud height data during 2015 – 2016 from a laser ceilometer with electric field mill data, <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> charge is derived using a horizontal charged disk model. The median daily <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> charge density found was 0. 86 nC m 2 from 43 days’ data. This {{is consistent with a}} uniformly charged region ~ 40 m thick at the <b>cloud</b> <b>base,</b> now confirming that negative <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> charge is a common feature of terrestrial layer clouds. This technique can also be applied to planetary atmospheres and volcanic plumes...|$|R

30|$|The KH billow train {{observed}} {{inside the}} mid-level cloud but {{just above the}} <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> {{was associated with a}} MCT layer immediately below the <b>cloud</b> <b>base.</b> In fact, the upper edge of the MCT was deeply indented due to the billows above. During another ShUREX campaign in 2016, we observed a very similar event under very similar conditions, with occurrence again of a train of high-amplitude KH billows just above a mid-level <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> and a MCT layer underneath the <b>cloud</b> <b>base.</b> These were the only two instances during the three ShUREX campaigns (2015, 2016 and 2017) spanning over a total of 9  weeks, when we observed such spectacular, high-amplitude billows inside the mid-level cloud. In both cases, there was a MCT immediately below the <b>cloud</b> <b>base.</b> We do not know if the simultaneous presence of KH billows inside the cloud and MCT below the <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> in these two instances is a mere happenstance. If it is not, then the dynamical mechanism responsible for simultaneous occurrence of shear instability above and convective instability below the <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> needs to be explored. It is worth noting that MCT arises due to rapid sublimation in the dry air layer below the <b>cloud</b> <b>base,</b> of ice particles falling down from the cloud into the dry layer. These particles might have originated from condensation of ice nuclei inside the cloud immediately above the <b>cloud</b> <b>base.</b> Are the two events dynamically related? If so, how? We do not know the answer to these questions.|$|R

40|$|The {{degree to}} which cloud {{immersion}} provides water in addition to rainfall, suppresses transpiration, and sustains tropical montane cloud forests (TMCFs) during rainless periods is not well understood. Climate and land use changes represent a threat to these forests if <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> altitude rises {{as a result of}} regional warming or deforestation. To establish a baseline for quantifying future changes in <b>cloud</b> <b>base,</b> we installed a ceilometer at 100  m altitude in the forest upwind of the TMCF that occupies an altitude range from ∼[*] 600  m to the peaks at 1100  m in the Luquillo Mountains of eastern Puerto Rico. Airport Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) ceilometer data, radiosonde data, and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite data were obtained to investigate seasonal <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> dynamics, altitude of the trade-wind inversion (TWI), and typical cloud thickness for the surrounding Caribbean region. <b>Cloud</b> <b>base</b> is rarely quantified near mountains, so these results represent a first look at seasonal and diurnal <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> dynamics for the TMCF. From May  2013 to August  2016, <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> was lowest during the midsummer dry season, and <b>cloud</b> <b>bases</b> were lower than the mountaintops as often in the winter dry season as in the wet seasons. The lowest <b>cloud</b> <b>bases</b> most frequently occurred at higher elevation than 600  m, from 740 to 964  m. The Luquillo forest low <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> altitudes were higher than six other sites in the Caribbean by ∼[*] 200 – 600  m, highlighting the importance of site selection to measure topographic influence on cloud height. Proximity to the oceanic cloud system where shallow cumulus clouds are seasonally invariant in altitude and cover, along with local trade-wind orographic lifting and cloud formation, may explain the dry season low clouds. The results indicate that climate change threats to low-elevation TMCFs are not limited to the dry season; changes in synoptic-scale weather patterns that increase frequency of drought periods during the wet seasons (periods of higher <b>cloud</b> <b>base)</b> may also impact ecosystem health...|$|R
500|$|Nomura {{sought to}} make Cloud's design [...] "distinctly {{different}} from the other characters." [...] About thirty different designs were made for Cloud's face, and his hair was altered both to give it a more realistic look and to illustrate that two years had passed since the game's conclusion. The staff attempted rendering <b>Cloud</b> <b>based</b> on the game's original illustrations, but concluded that doing so left his eyes unrealistically big, which [...] "looked gross." [...] Further revisions were made to Cloud's face after completion of the pilot film, which featured a more realistic style. In contrast to his hair, Cloud's clothes were difficult to make in the film. Deciding to give Cloud a simple costume consistent with the concept of [...] "clothes designed for action", the staff began {{with the idea of a}} black robe, eventually parring it down to a [...] "long apron" [...] shifted to one side. Cloud's weaponry was based on the joking observation that because his sword in the original game was already enormously tall, in the sequel, he should use sheer numbers. Referred to as [...] "the fusion swords" [...] during the film's development, early storyboard concepts included Cloud carrying six swords on his back, although the idea was later modified to six interlocking swords. While the idea wasn't [...] "logically thought out" [...] and the staff didn't think that they could [...] "make it work physically", it was believed to provide [...] "an interesting accent to the story." [...] Cloud's new motorcycle, , was designed by Takayuki Takeya, who was asked by the staff to design an upgraded version of Cloud's [...] "Hardy-Daytona" [...] motorcycle from Final Fantasy VII. As development continued, the bike got bigger, with Takeya feeling its heaviness provided an impact that worked well within the film.|$|E

The <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> height distributions for low <b>cloud</b> (<b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> less than 800 [*]m) are found to vary with cosmic ray conditions. Further, 27 day and 1. 68 year periodicities characteristic of cosmic ray variations are present, weakly, in the <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> height data of stratiform clouds, when such periodicities are present in neutron monitor cosmic ray data.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThis thesis study {{focuses on the}} evaluation of <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> height {{from a pair of}} space-based remote sensing systems. The first satellite, CloudSat, is a 94 -GHz cloud profiling radar (CPR) utilizing a wavelength capable of penetrating thick hydrometeor layers. The second satellite, the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) satellite, is an active lidar designed to detect optically thin hydrometeor layers. The 2 BGEOPROF- Lidar product combines data from these two synergistic observing platforms to provide a complete profile of the vertical structure of clouds in the atmosphere. For this research, 2 B-GEOPROF-Lidar <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> height measurements were validated against <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> height measurements from a combined suite of ground-based sensors at four Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) sites. <b>Cloud</b> <b>base</b> height measurements validated within 480 meters, the vertical resolution of the CPR, were deemed accurate assessments. Differences in <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> height exceeding 720 meters were labeled as significant outliers. Significant outliers were further investigated to find trends in radar reflectivity and cloud mask data from CloudSat and total attenuated backscatter from CALIPSO. The combined CloudSat / CALIPSO <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> assessment proved accurate in 73 % of the cases studied. US Air Force (USAF) author...|$|R

5000|$|Cloud suck is {{typically}} associated {{with an increase in}} thermal updraft velocity near <b>cloud</b> <b>base.</b> As a parcel of air lifted in a thermal rises, it also cools, and water vapour will eventually condense to form a cloud if the parcel rises above the lifted condensation level. As the water vapour condenses, it releases its latent heat of vaporization, thereby increasing the buoyancy of the parcel.The updraft is amplified by this latent heat release. Although the process that causes this amplification happens above <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> height, the effect is often noticeable as much as 300 m (1,000 feet) below <b>cloud</b> <b>base.</b> In fact, it is this effect below <b>cloud</b> <b>base,</b> not the effect within the cloud, that is generally referred to by pilots as cloud suck.
