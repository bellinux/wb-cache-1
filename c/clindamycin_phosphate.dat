40|$|Background: Acne vulgaris is a {{very common}} skin disease with a {{significant}} detrimental effect {{on the quality of}} life of the patients. Aims: To assess the comparative efficacy and safety of a nano-emulsion gel formulation of adapalene and clindamycin combination with its conventional formulation in the treatment of acne vulgaris of the face. It was a prospective, randomized, open label, active-controlled, multicentric, clinical trial. Methods: Eligible patients suffering from acne vulgaris of the face were randomized to receive once-daily treatment with a nano-emulsion gel or conventional gel formulation of adapalene 0. 1 % and <b>clindamycin</b> (as <b>phosphate)</b> 1 % combination for 12 weeks. Total, inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts, with grading of acne severity were carried out on a monthly basis. Safety assessments were done to determine the comparative local and systemic tolerability. Two-tailed significance testing was carried out with appropriate statistical tests, and P-values < 0. 05 were considered as significant. Results: 209 / 212 patients enrolled in the study were eligible for efficacy and safety assessments in both nano-emulsion gel (118 / 119 patients) and conventional gel (91 / 93 patients) groups. Significantly better reductions in total (79. 7 % vs. 62. 7 %), inflammatory (88. 7 % vs. 71. 4 %) and noninflammatory (74. 9 % vs. 58. 4 %) lesions were reported with the nano-emulsion gel as compared to the conventional gel (P < 0. 001 for all). Mean acne severity score also reduced significantly more with the nano-emulsion formulation (1. 9 ± 0. 9 vs. 1. 4 ± 1. 0; P < 0. 001) than the comparator. Significantly lower incidence and lesser intensity of adverse events like local irritation (4. 2 % vs. 19. 8 %; P < 0. 05) and erythema (0. 8 % vs. 9. 9 %; P < 0. 05) were recorded with the nano-emulsion gel. Conclusions: The nano-emulsion gel formulation of adapalene and clindamycin combination appears to be more efficacious and better tolerated than the conventional formulation for the treatment of acne vulgaris in Indian patients. Further studies can elucidate the comparative treatment benefits of this nano-emulsion gel formulation...|$|R

40|$|Background: Topical retinoids {{normalize}} desquamation, reduce comedogenesis and {{may enhance}} the penetration of other topicals providing more effective treatment of acne. Aim: We evaluated {{the effect of}} adapalene on skin penetration of <b>clindamycin</b> <b>phosphate</b> when it is applied concomitantly or after various time durations following adapalene application. Methods: The in vitro {{studies were carried out}} using excised rat skin, whereas the in vivo studies were conducted on healthy human volunteers. Radioactive <b>clindamycin</b> <b>phosphate</b> (1 &#x 0025;) gel was applied to rat skin sections and to the hands of human volunteers concomitantly and after the pretreatment of the skin for 3, 5 and 10 min with 10 mg of adapalene (0. 1 &#x 0025;) gel. Quantification of <b>clindamycin</b> <b>phosphate</b> was performed by liquid scintillation. Results: In vitro skin penetration and distribution of <b>clindamycin</b> <b>phosphate</b> was affected by the pretreatment time. Significantly higher skin concentration of <b>clindamycin</b> <b>phosphate</b> (15. 5 &#x 0025;) with largest proportion in viable skin layer (9. 4 &#x 0025; of applied dose) was found when <b>clindamycin</b> <b>phosphate</b> gel was applied after the pretreatment of the skin with adapalene gel for 5 min.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Acne {{is treated}} {{according}} to the clinical observations and pathophysiologically relevant mechanisms, such as hyper [...] keratinization, seborrhea and bacterial proliferation. In mild and moderate forms of inflammatory acne, topical antimicrobials are recommended as a monotherapy or in combination with topical retinoids. OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical effectiveness, tolerability, impact on {{quality of life and}} effect on sebum excretion of three antimicrobial preparations: <b>clindamycin</b> <b>phosphate,</b> benzoyl peroxide and a combination of <b>clindamycin</b> <b>phosphate</b> plus benzoyl peroxide. METHODS: In total, 240 patients were randomized into treatment groups for an 8 [...] week study. Every two weeks the patients were evaluated using the following methods: photography, the Global Acne Grading System, sebumetric evaluation, and the Acne [...] Specific Quality of Life questionnaire. In addition, 80 healthy controls were enrolled for the sebumetric evaluation. RESULTS: A significant improvement in acne and the quality of life was observed for all three therapies {{at the end of the}} study. The sebum excretion results for the three treatment groups displayed significant and unpredictable variation, whereas the controls groups exhibited no significant variation. The three treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of the three antimicrobial preparations likely results from their anti [...] inflammatory and bacteriostatic activities. In contrast, seborrhoea seems to be minimally impacted...|$|E
40|$|Facial acne vulgaris {{can have}} {{profound}} effects on health-related quality of life. In some studies, patients with acne vulgaris reported results {{similar to those}} noted with other chronic diseases, such as asthma, arthritis, or diabetes. Clinical objective assessments alone do not adequately capture the impact of acne vulgaris severity from a patient’s perspective. Health-related quality-of-life assessment is important in order to fully characterize the overall burden of disease and effectiveness of treatment as the perspectives of the patient are also taken into account. Previous studies {{of the impact of}} acne vulgaris treatment on health-related quality of life have been limited in their scope of assessment. Drawbacks of prior studies have included small numbers of patients, health-related quality-of-life parameters that were not adequately evaluated, inclusion of only a limited range of mild-to-moderate acne vulgaris severity, or being unblinded or observational in study design. The Acne Quality of Life is an acne-specific questionnaire developed to assess treatment impact on the health-related quality of life of patients with acne vulgaris. Its psychometric properties and degree of responsiveness are well-established. Improvement in Acne Quality of Life with the fixed combination <b>clindamycin</b> <b>phosphate</b> 1. 2 %/benzoyl peroxide 2. 5 % aqueous gel in the largest cohort of acne vulgaris patients where health-related quality of life was studied has been reported recently. Significant improvements in all four domains over 12 weeks were seen with <b>clindamycin</b> <b>phosphate</b> 1. 2 %/benzoyl peroxide 2. 5 % aqueous gel compared to patients treated with individual active ingredients or vehicle (p< 0. 001). Length and time required for completion of the 19 -item Acne Quality of Life questionnaire is likely to preclude its use in clinical practice. A condensed, validated Acne Q- 4 scale based on the four items most broadly representative of health-related quality of life combined {{with a high level of}} correlation to the Acne Quality of Life questionnaire has been suggested as a more realistic approach that may be applied by clinicians when managing patients with acne vulgaris. The authors present data on the effectiveness of <b>clindamycin</b> <b>phosphate</b> 1. 2 %/benzoyl peroxide 2. 5 % aqueous gel on health-related quality of life based on this Acne Q- 4 scale...|$|E
40|$|<b>Clindamycin</b> <b>phosphate</b> is an {{antibiotic}} which is effective against both Staphylococcus aureus and the anaerobic organisms. In thirteen patients, its concentration following joint replacement {{was measured by}} the agar diffusion method. In bone, the concentration was (mean +/- s. e. mean) 5. 01 microgram/ml +/- 1. 16, N= 10; in capsule, 3. 29 microgram/ml +/- 0. 71, N= 12; measured between 1. 75 and 3. 75 hr after intramuscular and intravenous injections, and in drainage fluid it amounted to 4. 61 microgram/ml +/- 0. 38, N= 11 in 48 hr. Two patients developed diarrhoea which settled within a short period...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND It {{has been}} shown that topical nanoliposomal {{formulations}} improve burn healing process. On the other hand, it {{has been shown}} that liposomal formulations increase drug deposition in the normal skin while decrease their systemic absorption; there is not such data available for burn eschar. Present investigation studies permeation of <b>clindamycin</b> <b>phosphate</b> (CP) through burn eschar from liposomal formulations to answer this question. In this investigation, permeation of CP through fully hydrated third-degree burn eschar was evaluated using solution, normal nanoliposomes and ultradeformable nanoliposomes. METHODS Liposomal CP were prepared by thin-film hydration and characterized in terms of size, size distribution, zeta potential...|$|E
