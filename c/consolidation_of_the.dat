Chapter 9, The Plan, addresses CBC's adaption to new technology and the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Canadian telecommunications industry. Stursberg details his struggles with the new CBC president Hubert Lacroix, who did not endorse Stursberg's strategy of providing popular content and initiated a new strategic planning process.

In 1952, he became a candidate for entry into the Central Committee and, in 1961, was inducted as a full member.

5|$|In the 1930s {{and early}} 1940s, the Navy divided carrier-borne bombers into two types: the torpedo bomber and the dive bomber, each with crews {{of two or}} three men. Wartime {{experience}} showed that pilots could aim bombs and torpedoes without assistance from other crewmembers as well as navigate with the aid of radio beacons and the development of more powerful engines meant that faster aircraft no longer needed a rear gunner for self-defense. Furthermore, the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two types of bombers greatly increased the flexibility of a carrier's air group and allowed the number of fighters in an air group to be increased.|$|E

40|$|Fine-grained sediments on land, or in a {{freshwater}} or marine environment, {{may become}} contaminated {{with a wide}} range of pollutants including hydrocarbons. This paper is concerned with preliminary studies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mobilization and transportation <b>of</b> hydrocarbons, during <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> <b>consolidation,</b> to adjacent sediments or water bodies. A modified Rowe Cell was used to measure <b>the</b> <b>consolidation</b> properties <b>of</b> prepared kaolinite and bentonite clay-water slurries, with and without <b>the</b> addition <b>of</b> oil, along with hydrocarbon-bearing drill-cuttings samples taken from the sea-bed adjacent to two North Sea oil-well platforms. <b>The</b> <b>consolidation</b> properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kaolinite and bentonite clay slurries were little altered by <b>the</b> addition <b>of</b> oil, which was present at concentrations of between 8073 and 59 572 mg kg(- 1). During each <b>consolidation</b> stage, samples <b>of</b> <b>the</b> expelled pore-fluids were collected and analysed for oil content. These values were very low in comparison with the original oil concentration in the samples and changed little between each <b>consolidation</b> stage. Analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slurry samples both before and after consolidation confirms that, proportionally, little oil is removed as a result <b>of</b> <b>consolidation.</b> <b>The</b> implication <b>of</b> these results is that, for <b>the</b> range <b>of</b> samples tested, <b>the</b> very high hydraulic gradients and particle rearrangements that occur during <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> are capable <b>of</b> releasing only proportionally small amounts of oil bound to the fine-grained clay and silt particles...|$|R
5|$|In {{the course}} of its breed surveys and monitoring, the Conservancy has found {{significant}} changes in the populations of several swine breeds. The Berkshire breed has increased significantly in number, partially due to international demand for its meat, while other breeds have shown significant decreases, most likely due to increasing <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pork industry to large producers who use only a few specialized pork strains. Breeds such as the Chester White and Poland China have seen population numbers reduced by over 25 percent between 1998 and 2003, while the Hampshire and Yorkshire breeds have decreased by more than 30 percent in the same time.|$|E
5|$|In {{the race}} for city commissioners, each party nominates two {{candidates}} and the top three are elected.

As in the other races, the Democrats triumphed, electing both Maurice S. Osser and Thomas P. McHenry. McHenry was an incumbent who had served as commissioner since 1945, while Osser was new to the office, having previously worked as a lawyer and {{as the leader of the}} 16th ward.

5|$|Manual {{removal of}} the Japanese {{knotweed}} has preserved heritage stations of common butterbur and hart's-tongue fern. Early hand pruning was conducive to orchids. The late mowing seems rather ineffective. The grubbing-up of the Canada golden-rod and American asters was successful. The bush clearing and selective logging have helped maintain the wood-fringe with narrow-leaved everlasting-pea and liquorice milkvetch. Common spotted orchid, zigzag clover and lesser butterfly-orchid, species non-adapted to open areas, benefited areas without clearing. The low dry-stone walls probably favored the installation of viviparous lizard or common wall lizard, observed in 2013, but also the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hart's-tongue fern population.|$|E
5|$|On July 11, 1844, Philadelphia {{passed an}} {{ordinance}} {{that gave the}} city a battalion of artillery, a regiment of infantry {{and at least one}} full troop of cavalry for the purpose of providing the preservation of peace within the city when necessary. The difficulty of quelling the riots and other crime led to the Pennsylvania General Assembly to pass an 1845 act that required Philadelphia, the township of Moyamensing and the unincorporated districts of Spring Garden, Northern Liberties, and Penn to maintain a police force of one man per 150 taxable inhabitants. In 1850, another act was passed that established that the Philadelphia police force would police the city and seven surrounding districts. The inability to maintain order effectively in Philadelphia's suburbs would be an important argument for the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city in 1854.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Capping is a {{cost-effective}} remediation method for soft contaminated sludge. The Madison Metropolitan Sewerage District evaluated different remediation alternatives to treat its polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contaminated sludge and the U. S. EPA agreed to permit capping as <b>the</b> method <b>of</b> remediation. Design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cap required knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>consolidation</b> behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sludge. In order to analyze this behavior, a series <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> tests was performed. The laboratory testing program included three large-scale consolidation tests and four conventional oedometer tests. <b>Consolidation</b> settlement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sludge {{was observed in}} two field test cells capped with a wood chip/soil mixture which was reinforced with a woven geotextile. Instrumentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> test cells included settlement plates, surface survey markers, and piezometers at different depths in the sludge. Laboratory and field observations were compared with results from conventional consolidation theory and a nonlinear finite-strain (large strain) numerical model (CS 2). Conventional theory exhibited some limitations in analyzing the results and underpredicted the time for completion <b>of</b> <b>consolidation.</b> However, <b>the</b> large strain model more accurately predicted the behavior observed in both the laboratory and the field...|$|R
