25|$|Almost all <b>civil</b> <b>work</b> is {{dealt with}} by either the High Court or County Courts. Prior to the Act, there was a simple {{financial}} boundary to decide which cases would go to which court—any contract or tort case valued at less than £5,000 {{would go to the}} County Courts, while any case valued at more than that would go straight to the High Court. Section 1 of the Act allows the Lord Chancellor to change the financial boundaries after consultation with senior judges such as the Lord Chief Justice and the Master of the Rolls, and also allows the Lord Chancellor to create categories based on things other than the financial value of the case, such as the complexity involved or the importance of any legal question likely to be raised. An exception to this rule is that the Lord Chancellor cannot ask a County Court to hear any case of judicial review.|$|E

To conduct activities within its <b>civil</b> <b>works</b> portfolio, the Corps received over $ 5 billion annually for fiscal years 2005 and 2006. During the last 4 years, GAO has issued five reports relating to the Corps' <b>Civil</b> <b>Works</b> Program. Four of these reports focused on the planning studies for specific Corps' projects or actions, which included a review of the cost and benefit analyses used to support the project decisions. The fifth report focused on the Corps management of its <b>civil</b> <b>works</b> appropriation accounts. For this statement, GAO was asked to summarize the key themes from these five studies. GAO made recommendations in the five reports cited in this testimony. The Corps generally agreed with and has taken or is taking corrective action to respond to these recommendations.
