40|$|The ontogenic {{evolution}} of nitrogen concentration in two rye cultivars, one of fast {{and the other}} one of moderate initial growth, was evaluated by vector diagrams. A field trial was carried out using a randomized complete block design, with a 2 x 6 factorial arrangement (cultivars x <b>clipping</b> <b>dates)</b> of treatments and three replications, during two consecutive years. After 30 days of plant emergence, a series of six clips were performed in experimental plots, with a frequency of one every 21 days, to determine total accumulation of aerial biomass dry matter (DM). From the clipped herbage mass, a subsample was taken for the determination of total nitrogen (N) concentration. The vector diagram was built up by plotting mean N concentrations (y – axis), against mean N contents (x – axis), and the third variable was DM accumulation (z – axis). Values of N concentration and DM accumulation were different (P< 0. 01) between cultivars and <b>clipping</b> <b>dates,</b> while N content was different (P< 0. 01) between <b>clipping</b> <b>dates.</b> The cultivar of moderate initial growth showed, at similar accumulated amounts of DM, higher N content and hence, higher concentration of N. For both cultivars, N concentration was high in the first clip, and decreased onwards. Within clip for the first three dates, decrease in N concentration {{can be explained by the}} dilution effect of plant growth; for clips 4 to 6, it may be due to reduced nutrient assimilation. The vector diagrams technique is a good tool to discriminate between nutrient concentration changes due to plant assimilation or DM accumulation differences...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the provision of palliative care services in England by voluntary hospices. The literature on voluntary hospices is fragmented and scattered within and across academic and practitioner discourses. Our argument is that we can consolidate this literature into a descriptive business model. This reveals how charitable income streams donated to voluntary hospices are significant relative to government funding. However, this charitable income is uncertain and volatile. Hospices operate with significant balance sheet reserves as a hedge against uncertainty but these funds, invested in capital markets, recycle uncertainty. Rubbing up against uncertainty, embedded in the hospice business model, is the fact that demand for palliative care will certainly increase. The population is expanding and we are generally living longer and this is set to inflate demand for hospice palliative care. Imaginative government policies, informed by the descriptive business model of hospice palliative care, are required if choice and demand for end of life palliative care are to be satisfied. Policies could include government: underwriting a higher share of hospice income, matching funds for an emergency contingency reserve, inventing ???hospice bonds??? with a <b>coupon</b> <b>clip</b> above treasury rate to boost income whilst also preserving development funds set aside. Without change, the capacity to deliver patient choice and hospice palliative care going forward is at risk...|$|R
