40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the effect of}} air-side fouling on the energy consumption of constant air volume (CAV) heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in residential and small commercial buildings. There is a particular focus on evaluating the potential energy savings that may result from the remediation of such fouling from coils, filters, and other air system components. A computer model was constructed to simulate {{the behavior of a}} building and its <b>duct</b> <b>system</b> under various levels of fouling. The model was verified through laboratory and field testing and then used to run parametric simulations to examine the range of energy impacts for various <b>climates</b> and <b>duct</b> <b>system</b> characteristics. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the impact of parameters like duct insulation, duct leakage, duct location, and duct design on savings potential. <b>Duct</b> <b>system</b> pressures, temperatures, and energy consumption for two houses were monitored for one month.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} an indoor <b>climate</b> <b>system</b> is to fulfil the needed thermal comfort and provide {{satisfactory}} {{indoor air quality}} {{with respect to a}} resource perspective. This study focused on the <b>duct</b> <b>system</b> and investigated the resulting life cycle cost (LCC) {{depending on the size of}} the duct components. In actual Swedish systems, the component sizes are discretely increasing with a ratio of 100. 1. It was of interest to determine the influence from the size ratio. The result shows that the size influence was small and that there was no need for more dimensions than the Swedish standard provides. To design a <b>duct</b> <b>system</b> towards an optimal constant pressure drop per length of duct does not increase the life cycle cost much compared to the best combination. It was also shown that the life cycle cost did increase 6 % if the dimension was discrete and held constant at each level of the <b>duct</b> <b>system</b> compared to the optimal combination of continuously sized ducts. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{method is}} {{presented}} to estimate the probability distributions of <b>climate</b> <b>system</b> properties based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. At {{the base of the}} model, we use simulations of a climate model in which the outputs depend on the <b>climate</b> <b>system</b> properties and can also be compared with observations. The degree to which the model outputs are “consistent ” with the observations is used to obtain the likelihood for the <b>climate</b> <b>system</b> properties. We define the <b>climate</b> <b>system</b> properties as those properties of the climate model that control the large-scale response of the <b>climate</b> <b>system</b> to external forcings.

40|$|We {{propose to}} replace the {{classical}} pyramid of climate models by a spectrum of <b>climate</b> <b>system</b> models. The spectrum includes an indicator which characterizes the number of components of the <b>climate</b> <b>system,</b> including the interaction among them, being explicitly described in a model. The location of several model types in the new spectrum is specified. In particular, {{the location of the}} so-called Earth system models of intermediate complexity (EMICs) is discussed. It be-comes apparent that there exists a broad range of EMICs. In some of them, the number of proc-esses and/or the detail of description is reduced for the sake of simulating the feedbacks between as many components of the <b>climate</b> <b>system</b> as feasible. Others, with a lesser degree of interac-tion are used for long-term ensemble simulations to study specific aspects of climate variability. EMICs appear to be closer to comprehensive coupled models of atmospheric and oceanic cir-culation (CGCMs) than to conceptual models or box models. We advocate EMICs as being complementary to CGCMs and conceptual models. Hence we argue that CGCMs are not per se the apex in the field of <b>climate</b> <b>system</b> modelling. Instead, we believe that there is an advantage of a spectrum of <b>climate</b> <b>system</b> models which are designed to tackle specific aspects of climate and which together provide the proper tool for <b>climate</b> <b>system</b> modelling...|$|R

5000|$|Climate [...] "forcings" [...] may push a <b>climate</b> <b>system</b> in the {{direction}} of warming or cooling, for example, increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases cause warming at the surface.
