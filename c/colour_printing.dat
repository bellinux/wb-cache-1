This method could produce almost all the colours in the spectrum with reasonable accuracy.|$|E

25|$|The table below {{shows the}} {{changing}} use of colours since Beck's first map. The current colours are taken from Transport for London's colour standards guide, which defines the precise colours from the Pantone palette, and also a colour naming scheme that is particular to TfL.

Improvements in <b>colour</b> <b>printing</b> technology have reduced this problem and the map has coped with the identification of new lines without great difficulty.|$|E
25|$|In 1865 Vincent Brooks became {{involved}} with the ‘inventor’ of <b>colour</b> <b>printing</b> George Baxter. He purchased many of Baxter’s plates and printed them using Baxter’s presses which he had lent him on the understanding that George Baxter Jr. took up the management of them and that George Baxter himself supervised the work. It was a complex process that required up to 20 blocks per image. The process failed to pay its way and Brooks sold the plant four years later to Abraham Le Blond.|$|E
25|$|In {{the metal}} type era, type-founding {{companies}} often would offer pre-formed illustrations as fonts showing objects and designs {{likely to be}} useful for printing and advertisements, the equivalent of modern clip art and stock photographs. As examples, the American Type Founders specimen of 1897 offered designs including baseball players, animals, Christmas wreaths, designs for cheques, and emblems such as state seals for government printing. The practice has declined as printing custom illustrations and <b>colour</b> <b>printing</b> using processes such as lithography has become cheaper, although illustration typefaces are still sold by some companies.

25|$|Hedley {{returned}} to 19 Company once {{the war was}} over, and remained with them until 1903, and he continued in surveying duties with the Ordnance Survey until 1906. He was then appointed as an advisor to the Survey of India in order to modernise map production methods, following efforts by the previous Viceroy of India, George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston, and to reform the Survey. Although Hedley faced some resistance to the proposals he made, he was ultimately successful in achieving reform and the Geodetic & Research Branch of the Survey of India still holds in its archives, Notes on the organization, methods and process of the photo-litho office, Calcutta by Major W.C Hedley.

This ink and wash work may have been executed in 1818, along with the addition of the frame lines, although this cannot be ascertained for certain. Several of the plates also bear evidence of rudimentary <b>colour</b> <b>printing,</b> a method with which Blake was experimenting in the 1790s, and these plates may represent his first attempts at this technique (whereby he used coloured inks to print rather than black). Several of the plates also feature examples of white line engraving, a technique where Blake would literally cut into the stop-out to create tiny furrows, which would be eaten away by the acid, creating a streak effect in the final print.|$|E

25|$|Jones's {{studies of}} the Alhambra in Granada were pivotal in the {{development}} of his theories on flat pattern, geometry and polychromy. His travelling companion, Jules Goury, had recently been working with Gottfried Semper on his analysis of the polychromy of Ancient Greek buildings, and this was very likely a key factor in Jones embarking on such a scientific and detailed appraisal of the decoration at the Alhambra. Goury died of cholera – at the age of 31 – during their six-month stay at the Alhambra, and Jones returned to London determined to publish the results of their studies. The standard of <b>colour</b> <b>printing</b> at that time was not sophisticated enough to do justice to the intricate decoration of the Alhambra, therefore Jones undertook the printing work himself. Collaborating with chemists and printers, Jones took it upon himself to research the new process of chromolithography. He issued this labour of love, Plans, Elevations, Sections and Details of the Alhambra, in twelve parts over a period of almost ten years, from 1836 to 1845. It was the world's first ever published work of any significance to employ chromolithography, and was to be a key milestone {{in the development of}} Owen Jones's reputation as a design theorist.|$|E
500|$|While <b>colour</b> <b>printing</b> in Japan {{dates to}} the 1640s, early ukiyo-e prints used only black ink. [...] Colour was {{sometimes}} added by hand, using a red lead ink in tan-e prints, or later in a pink safflower ink in beni-e prints. [...] <b>Colour</b> <b>printing</b> arrived in books in the 1720s and in single-sheet prints in the 1740s, with a different block and printing for each colour. [...] Early colours were limited to pink and green; techniques expanded over the following two decades to allow up to five colours. [...] The mid-1760s brought full-colour nishiki-e prints made from ten or more woodblocks. [...] To keep the blocks for each colour aligned correctly registration marks called kentō were placed on one corner and an adjacent side.|$|E

500|$|Even in the {{earliest}} monochromatic prints and books, colour was added by hand for special commissions. [...] Demand for colour in the early-18th century was met with tan-e prints hand-tinted with orange and sometimes green or yellow. [...] These were followed in the 1720s with a vogue for pink-tinted beni-e and later the lacquer-like ink of the urushi-e. [...] In 1744, the benizuri-e were the first successes in <b>colour</b> <b>printing,</b> using multiple woodblocks—one for each colour, {{the earliest}} beni pink and vegetable green.|$|E
500|$|In the mid-1850s, Evans and Foster visited Scotland {{to create}} {{sketches}} {{for a series}} of guide books, which Evans printed. He later engraved Foster's illustrations for Lady of the Lake, and Foster's illustrations for The Poetical Works of George Herbert (1856), printed in Edinburgh. Of the George Herbert engravings he states: [...] "these illustrations I consider the best that I ever engraved". By 1856 Evans had [...] "perfected a process of <b>colour</b> <b>printing</b> from wood blocks", and achieved a reputation as the preeminent wood engraver and best colour printer in London.|$|E
500|$|The Ming dynasty {{had seen}} {{considerable}} advancement {{in the process}} of <b>colour</b> <b>printing</b> in China. At his studio, Hu Zhengyan experimented with various forms of woodblock printing, creating processes for producing multi-coloured prints and embossed printed designs. As a result, he was able to produce some of China's first printed publications in colour, using a block printing technique known as [...] "assorted block printing" [...] (douban yinshua, [...] ). This system made use of multiple blocks, each carved with {{a different part of the}} final image and each bearing a different colour. It was a lengthy, painstaking process, requiring thirty to fifty engraved printing blocks and up to seventy inkings and impressions to create a single image. Hu also employed a related form of multiple-block printing called [...] "set-block printing" [...] (taoban yinshua, [...] ), which had existed since the Yuan period some 200 years earlier but had only recently come into fashion again. He refined these block printing techniques by developing a process for wiping some of the ink off the blocks before printing; this enabled him to achieve gradation and modulation of shades which were not previously possible.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the first}} half of the seventeenth century, the {{proliferation}} of the printing press coupled with the persistence of difficulties in and expense of <b>colour</b> <b>printing</b> prompted the development of a number of systems of hatching for the purpose of depicting heraldic designs without the use of colour.

2500|$|At {{the end of}} 1911, {{while he}} was {{developing}} his skills as an etcher, Blampied decided to try his luck as an independent artist with his own studio. The rapid developments in <b>colour</b> <b>printing</b> and advertising of the time were creating {{a great deal of}} work for commercial artists for [...] book and magazine publishers in London. The first recorded illustration was for a piece of sheet music entitled Glamour Valse, published by Ascherberg, Hopwood and Crew. Blampied quickly gained commissions to provide drawings for Pearson’s Magazine, The Sketch, The Sphere, The Ladies Field, The Queen and The Graphic, many of which were signed [...] "Blam", a diminutive first recorded in The Tatler in January 1916. He used this diminutive for much of his commercial work for books and magazines, including three children's books for the Edinburgh publisher Thomas Nelson and Sons, Blam's Book of Fun, The Jolly ABC, and The Breezy Farm ABC, all published in 1921, and for much of his work for Pearson's Magazine, Hutchinson's Magazine, The Bystander, and The Sketch between 1916 and 1939.|$|E
2500|$|Chromolithography {{became the}} most {{successful}} of several methods of <b>colour</b> <b>printing</b> developed by the 19th century; other methods were developed by printers such as Jacob Christoph Le Blon, George Baxter and Edmund Evans, and mostly relied on using several woodblocks with the colors. Hand-coloring also remained important; elements of the official British Ordnance Survey maps were colored by hand by boys until 1875. [...] Chromolithography developed from lithography and the term covers various types of lithography that are printed in color. The initial technique involved {{the use of multiple}} lithographic stones, one for each color, and was still extremely expensive when done for the best quality results. Depending on the number of colors present, a chromolithograph could take months to produce, by very skilled workers. [...] However much cheaper prints could be produced by simplifying both the number of colors used, and the refinement of the detail in the image. [...] Cheaper images, like the advertisement illustrated, relied heavily on an initial black print (not always a lithograph), on which colors were then overprinted. To make an expensive reproduction print as what was once referred to as a [...] "’chromo’", a lithographer, with a finished painting in front of him, gradually created and corrected the many stones using proofs to look as much as possible like the painting in front of him, sometimes using dozens of layers.|$|E
