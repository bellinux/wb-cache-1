5|$|HSP {{can develop}} after infections with streptococci (β-haemolytic, Lancefield group A), {{hepatitis}} B, herpes simplex virus, parvovirus B19, <b>Coxsackievirus,</b> adenovirus, Helicobacter pylori, measles, mumps, rubella, Mycoplasma and numerous others. Drugs linked to HSP, usually as an idiosyncratic reaction, include the antibiotics vancomycin and cefuroxime, ACE inhibitors enalapril and captopril, anti-inflammatory agent diclofenac, {{as well as}} ranitidine and streptokinase. Several diseases {{have been reported to}} be associated with HSP, often without a causative link. Only in about 35% of cases can HSP be traced to any of these causes.|$|E
5|$|Diseases {{may also}} affect the {{pericardium}} which surrounds the heart, which when inflamed is called pericarditis. This {{may result from}} infective causes (such as glandular fever, cytomegalovirus, <b>coxsackievirus,</b> tuberculosis or Q fever), systemic disorders such as amyloidosis or sarcoidosis, tumours, high uric acid levels, and other causes. This inflammation affects {{the ability of the}} heart to pump effectively. When fluid builds up in the pericardium this is called pericardial effusion, which when it causes acute heart failure is called cardiac tamponade. This may be blood from a traumatic injury or fluid from an effusion. This can compress the heart and adversely affect the function of the heart. The fluid can be removed from the pericardial sac using a syringe in a procedure called pericardiocentesis.|$|E
25|$|The {{viruses that}} cause the disease are of the Picornaviridae family. <b>Coxsackievirus</b> A16 {{is the most common}} cause of HFMD. Enterovirus 71 (EV-71) is the second-most common cause. Many other strains of <b>coxsackievirus</b> and {{enterovirus}} can also be responsible.|$|E
50|$|<b>Coxsackieviruses</b> {{are divided}} into group A and group B viruses based on early {{observations}} of their pathogenicity in neonatal mice. Group A <b>coxsackieviruses</b> were noted to cause a flaccid paralysis (which was caused by generalized myositis) while group B <b>coxsackieviruses</b> were noted to cause a spastic paralysis (due to focal muscle injury and degeneration of neuronal tissue). At least 23 serotypes (1-22, 24) of group A and six serotypes (1-6) of group B are recognized.|$|R
40|$|Aim: Study of {{the role}} of <b>Coxsackieviruses</b> B in the {{etiology}} of enterovirus infection and other forms of neurological pathology and also the frequency of isolation of enteroviruses excreted by children living on the territory of the Russian Federation. Materials and methods: We investigated 1722 samples from children with acute flaccid paralysis, 19030 samples from patients with enterovirus infection and 100 samples from healthy children from institutions of preschool education. Isolation and identification of enteroviruses were conducted according to WHO recommendations. Results: <b>Coxsackieviruses</b> B were detected in patients with acute flaccid paralysis and persons who had contacts with them. In the patients with enterovirus infection <b>Coxsackieviruses</b> B were isolated in 3, 6 % of cases, mainly in sporadic cases of enterovirus meningitis. In the structure of all isolated enteroviruses the percentage of <b>Coxsackieviruses</b> B was rather high (26 %) and it was only lower than those of enterovirus ECHO 30 (32, 2 %) which caused the season’s peaks of enterovirus infection in 2007 – 2009 and 2013. <b>Coxsackieviruses</b> B were also detected in the samples from children from preschool institutions. These viruses prevailed in the structure of all isolated enteroviruses and they were isolated in the samples from some children in two preschool institutions which served as the proof of the virus propagation after their importation to the institution when children start attending the institutions after summer holidays. Conclusion: <b>Coxsackieviruses</b> B constantly circulated on a great number of territories. They are the etiologic factor of mainly sporadic but also group cases of enterovirus meningitis. In the structure of all isolated enteroviruses these viruses occupied the leading position during almost all the years of 10 years of surveillance. The examination of the children without clinical symptoms of infection revealed that <b>Coxsackieviruses</b> B constituted the majority among isolated enteroviruses. That proves the possibility that healthy children are carriers of <b>Coxsackieviruses</b> B. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{isolation}} of group A <b>coxsackieviruses</b> from clinical specimens generally requires {{the use of}} suckling mice. By using guinea pig embryo cells, the following <b>coxsackieviruses</b> were isolated from throat swabs and stool samples obtained from patients with a variety of illnesses: two of type A 2, one each of types A 6 and A 8, and four of type 10. Distinct cytopathic effects were produced in 3 to 5 days in the guinea pig embryo cells inoculated with the clinical specimens. In addition, a number of prototype group A <b>coxsackieviruses,</b> including types 2 [...] 6, 8, 10, and 12, were readily propagated in guinea pig embryo cell cultures. Thus, guinea pig embryo cells appeared to be a sensitive alternative cell culture system for the isolation and propagation of certain types of group A <b>coxsackieviruses...</b>|$|R
25|$|In December 2011, the California Department of Public Health {{identified}} a strong {{form of the}} virus, <b>coxsackievirus</b> A6 (CVA6), where nail loss in children is common.|$|E
25|$|The {{viruses that}} cause HFMD are spread through close {{personal}} contact, {{through the air}} from coughing, and the feces of an infected person. Contaminated objects can also spread the disease. <b>Coxsackievirus</b> A16 {{is the most common}} cause and Enterovirus 71 is the second-most common cause. Other strains of <b>coxsackievirus</b> and enterovirus can also be responsible. Some people may carry and pass on the virus despite having no symptoms of disease. Other animals are not involved. Diagnosis can often be made based on symptoms. Occasionally throat or stool sample may be tested for the virus.|$|E
25|$|During an outbreak, a {{diagnosis}} {{can be made}} by determining recent exposure and parotitis. However, when the disease incidence is low, other infectious causes of parotitis should be considered such as HIV, <b>coxsackievirus,</b> and influenza. Some viruses such as enteroviruses may cause aseptic meningitis that is very clinically similar to mumps.|$|E
50|$|<b>Coxsackieviruses</b> {{are among}} the leading causes of aseptic {{meningitis}} (the other usual suspects being echovirus and mumps virus).|$|R
50|$|Both group A {{and group}} B <b>coxsackieviruses</b> can cause nonspecific febrile illnesses, rashes, upper {{respiratory}} tract disease, and aseptic meningitis.|$|R
50|$|In general, group A <b>coxsackieviruses</b> tend {{to infect}} {{the skin and}} mucous membranes, causing herpangina, acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, and hand, foot, and mouth (HFM) disease.|$|R
25|$|For example, Klebsiella pneumoniae and <b>coxsackievirus</b> B {{have been}} {{strongly}} correlated with ankylosing spondylitis and diabetes mellitus type 1, respectively. This has been {{explained by the}} tendency of the infecting organism to produce super-antigens {{that are capable of}} polyclonal activation of B-lymphocytes, and production of large amounts of antibodies of varying specificities, some of which may be self-reactive (see below).|$|E
25|$|Adenoviruses is {{the most}} common cause of viral {{conjunctivitis}} (adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis). Herpetic keratoconjunctivitis (caused by herpes simplex viruses) can be serious and requires treatment with acyclovir. Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis is a highly contagious disease caused by one of two enteroviruses, Enterovirus 70 and <b>Coxsackievirus</b> A24. These were first identified in an outbreak in Ghana in 1969, and have spread worldwide since then, causing several epidemics.|$|E
25|$|Adenoviruses are unusually stable to {{chemical}} or physical agents and adverse pH conditions, allowing for prolonged survival {{outside of the}} body and water. Adenoviruses are spread primarily via respiratory droplets, however they can also be spread by fecal routes. Research into the molecular mechanisms underlying adenoviral transmission provide empirical evidence in support of the hypothesis that cellular receptors for adenovirus and <b>coxsackievirus</b> (CARs) are needed to transport adenoviruses into certain naive/progenitor cell types.|$|E
50|$|The <b>coxsackieviruses</b> were {{discovered}} in 1948-49 by Dr. Gilbert Dalldorf, a scientist working at the New York State Department of Health in Albany, New York.|$|R
50|$|Timing is crucial, and <b>coxsackieviruses,</b> rotaviruses and {{lymphocytic}} choriomeningitis virus that can be protective when given very early and can provoke autoimmunity when given late (for instance at weaning).|$|R
40|$|Wallis, Craig (Baylor University College of Medicine, Houston, Tex.), Fred Morales, Joycelyn Powell, and Joseph L. Melnick. Plaque {{enhancement}} of enteroviruses by magnesium chloride, cysteine, and pancreatin. J. Bacteriol. 91 : 1932 – 1935. 1966. —Plaque formation of 21 echoviruses (types 1 – 6, 9, 13, 15 – 19, 23 – 26, 29 – 32) and 8 <b>coxsackieviruses</b> (B 1 – 6, A 7, and A 9) was enhanced by increased concentrations of MgCl 2, l-cysteine, and pancreatin in agar overlay medium. In most cases, cationic and anionic polymers (diethylaminoethyl dextran, dextran sulfate, or protamine sulfate) were ineffective. All strains of poliovirus and group B <b>coxsackieviruses</b> were enhanced under agar by MgCl 2. Five {{of the eight}} <b>coxsackieviruses</b> tested were also enhanced by cysteine or pancreatin. Certain enteroviruses, which {{have been difficult to}} assay by plaque method, can now be quantified effectively by incorporation of additives such as MgCl 2, cysteine, or pancreatin into the overlay medium...|$|R
25|$|Entry {{of adenoviruses}} into the host cell {{involves}} {{two sets of}} interactions between the virus and the host cell. Most of the action occurs at the vertices. Entry into the host cell is initiated by the knob domain of the fiber protein binding to the cell receptor. The two currently established receptors are: CD46 for the group B human adenovirus serotypes and the <b>coxsackievirus</b> adenovirus receptor (CAR) for all other serotypes. There are some reports suggesting MHC molecules and sialic acid residues functioning in this capacity as well. This {{is followed by a}} secondary interaction, where a motif in the penton base protein interacts with an integrin molecule. It is the co-receptor interaction that stimulates entry of the adenovirus. This co-receptor molecule is αv integrin. Binding to αv integrin results in endocytosis of the virus particle via clathrin-coated pits. Attachment to αv integrin stimulates cell signaling and thus induces actin polymerization resulting in entry of the virion into the host cell within an endosome.|$|E
2500|$|Hand, {{foot and}} mouth disease most {{commonly}} occurs in {{children under the}} age of 10 and tends to occur in outbreaks during the spring, summer, and autumn seasons. HFMD is most commonly caused by infection with <b>Coxsackievirus</b> A16. HFMD is more prevalent in rural areas when compared to urban areas, however, socioeconomic status and hygiene levels need to considered.|$|E
2500|$|Complications {{from the}} viral infections that cause HFMD are rare, but require {{immediate}} medical treatment if present. HFMD infections caused by Enterovirus 71 {{tend to be}} more severe {{and are more likely to}} have neurologic or cardiac complications including death than infections caused by <b>Coxsackievirus</b> A16. Viral or aseptic meningitis can occur with HFMD in rare cases and is characterized by fever, headache, stiff neck, or back pain. [...] The condition is usually mild and clears without treatment; however, hospitalization for a short time may be needed. Other serious complications of HFMD include encephalitis (swelling of the brain), or flaccid paralysis in rare circumstances.|$|E
40|$|This {{work was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine whether}} Acanthamoeba could {{play a role in}} the survival and transmission of <b>coxsackieviruses</b> and focused on in vitro interactions between Acanthamoeba castellanii and coxsackie B 3 viruses (CVB- 3). Residual virus titer evaluations and immunofluorescence experiments revealed a remarkable CVB- 3 adsorption on amoeba surfaces and accumulation inside cells. The survival of viruses was independent of the dynamics of amoeba replication and encystment. In addition, our results indicated that virus-infected amoebas can release infectious viruses during interaction with human macrophages. On the basis of these data, Acanthamoeba appears to be a potential promoter of the survival of <b>coxsackieviruses</b> and their transmission to human hosts...|$|R
50|$|Group B <b>coxsackieviruses</b> tend {{to infect}} the heart, pleura, pancreas, and liver, causing pleurodynia, myocarditis, pericarditis, and {{hepatitis}} (inflammation {{of the liver}} {{not related to the}} hepatotropic viruses). Coxsackie B infection of the heart can lead to pericardial effusion.|$|R
40|$|Despite replicating to {{very high}} titers, <b>coxsackieviruses</b> do not elicit strong CD 8 T-cell responses, perhaps because antigen {{presentation}} is inhibited by virus-induced disruption of host protein trafficking. Herein, we evaluated {{the effects of}} three viral nonstructural proteins (2 B, 2 BC, and 3 A) on intracellular trafficking. All three of these proteins inhibited secretion, to various degrees, and directly associated with the Golgi complex, causing trafficking proteins to accumulate in this compartment. The 3 A protein almost completely ablated trafficking and secretion, by moving rapidly to the Golgi, and causing its disruption. Using an alanine-scanning 3 A mutant, we show that Golgi targeting and disruption can be uncoupled. Thus, <b>coxsackieviruses</b> rely on the combined effects of several gene products that target a single cellular organelle to successfully block protein secretion during an infection. These findings have implications for viral pathogenesis...|$|R
2500|$|Patients {{with both}} Epstein-Barr virus and {{infectious}} mononucleosis have cited {{an increase in}} the sizes of perceived objects, coinciding with other symptoms of Alice in Wonderland Syndrome. Additionally, it has been observed that Epstein-Barr patients who cite hallucinations display abnormal MRI scans. The MRI may show swelling of the cerebral cortex, transient T2 prolongation, and transient lesions. [...] Unlike in MRI's, no abnormalities have been reported in CT scans. It is thus recommended that an Epstein-Barr patient who cites visual hallucinations have an MRI scan. Macropsia may appear either before the onset, or after the resolution, of all clinical symptoms associated with the illness. The duration of the disturbances have been shown to range between two weeks and seven months. Almost all patients with macropsia due to infectious mononucleiosis make full recoveries. [...] Patients with <b>Coxsackievirus</b> B1 have reported numerous symptoms of Alice in Wonderland Syndrome, the most common of which being macropsia and micropsia.|$|E
50|$|The {{viruses that}} cause the disease are of the Picornaviridae family. <b>Coxsackievirus</b> A16 {{is the most common}} cause of HFMD. Enterovirus 71 (EV-71) is the second-most common cause. Many other strains of <b>coxsackievirus</b> and {{enterovirus}} can also be responsible.|$|E

50|$|EV68 {{is one of}} {{the more}} than one hundred types of enteroviruses, a group of ssRNA viruses {{containing}} the polioviruses, <b>coxsackieviruses,</b> and echoviruses. It is unenveloped. Unlike all other enteroviruses, EV68 displays acid lability and a lower optimum growth temperature, both characteristic features of the human rhinoviruses. It was previously called human rhinovirus 87 by some researchers.|$|R
40|$|Exposing human {{lymphoid cell}} lines to uncloned or {{recently}} cloned group B <b>coxsackieviruses</b> {{results in the}} frequent establishment of chronically infected cultures. Persistence is maintained by a carrier culture mechanism involving virus spread through the medium and replication among a minority of cells at any given time.

40|$|A {{microplate}} double antibody sandwich ELISA {{was employed}} in an immuno-logical {{study of the}} group B <b>Coxsackieviruses.</b> The assay, described in detail, detected high dilutions of virion antigen (less than IO ng) in purified preparations and in crude infected cell extracts. Furthermore, by using a constant amount of antigen, group B virus antibodies in hamster antisera could be quantified with a sensitivity equivalent to the virus neutralization test. Titrations of virus antigens and antibodies {{were found to be}} type-specific when purified virions were employed in the assay. Urea disruption of virions exposed antigens common to all six group B viruses. The heterotypic reactivity of disrupted group B virions did not extend to the other viruses tested. Immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that, of the four virion structural polypeptides (VPI to 4), VPI con-tained the major common antigenic determinants shared by members of the group B <b>Coxsackieviruses...</b>|$|R

50|$|A 2004 {{systematic}} review analyzing a possible association between <b>coxsackievirus</b> B infection and {{type 1 diabetes}} was inconclusive.

40|$|Mersalyl (Salyrgan), {{an organic}} mercurial diuretic, was tested against {{human and animal}} viruses with in vivo model infections in mice and tissue culture systems. Mersalyl was active against <b>coxsackieviruses</b> A 21 and B 1 in mice if {{administered}} intraperitoneally immediately after infection. No effect was observed if intraperitoneal treatment was delayed 1 or 2 h postinfection, or if treatment was administered either subcutaneously or per os. Topical treatment with a 5 % aqueous solution of mersalyl produced a statistically significant effect against herpes simplex dermatitis in mice but the substance was inactive against systemic infections in mice with herpes simplex as well as Columbia SK, influenza, Semliki Forest, and Sendai viruses. Contact inactivation of <b>coxsackieviruses</b> A 21 and B 1 and herpes simplex virus was observed, but mersalyl was inactive in tissue culture against coxackieviruses A 21 and B 1, herpes simplex, influenza, rhinovirus, Semliki Forest, Sendai, and vaccinia viruses...|$|R
40|$|Therapeutic {{interference}} with virus-cell surface receptor interactions represents a viable antiviral strategy. Here we demonstrate that cytoplasmic {{expression of the}} serine protease inhibitor (serpin), plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 (PAI- 2), affords {{a high level of}} protection from lytic infection by multiple human picornaviruses. The antiviral action of PAI 2 was mediated primarily through transcriptional down-regulation of the following virus receptors: intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM- 1, a cellular receptor for the major group of rhinoviruses), decay-accelerating factor (a cellular receptor for echoviruses and <b>coxsackieviruses),</b> {{and to a lesser extent}} the coxsackie-adenovirus receptor protein (a cellular receptor for group B <b>coxsackieviruses</b> and group C adenoviruses). Expression of related cell surface receptors, including membrane cofactor protein and the poliovirus receptor, remained unaffected. These findings suggest that PAI- 2 and/or related serpins may form the basis of novel antiviral strategies against picornavirus infections and also therapeutic interventions against ICAM- 1 -mediated respiratory inflammation...|$|R
