40|$|Abstract‚ÄîA {{method for}} obtaining electrocardiographic {{potential}} through thin <b>cloth</b> <b>inserted</b> between the measuring electrodes {{and the skin}} of a subject‚Äôs dorsal surface when lying supine has been proposed. The method is based on capacitive coupling involving the electrode, the cloth, and the skin. Examination of a pilot device which employed the method revealed the following: 1) In spite of the gain attenuation in the high frequency region, the proposed method was considered useful for monitoring electrogardiogram (ECG) for nondiagnostic purpose. 2) The method was able to yield a stable ECG from a subject at rest for at least 7 h, and there was no significant adverse effect of long-term measurement {{on the quality of the}} signal obtained. 3) Electrode area was the factor that had most influence on the signal, compared with other factors such as cloth thickness and coupling pressure, but could be reduced to 10 cm for heart rate detection. 4) Input capacitance of the device was assumed to be the dominant factor for the gain attenuation in the high frequency region, and should be reduced with a view to diagnostic use. Although there is still room for improvement in terms of practical use, the proposed method appears promising for application to bedding as a noninvasive and awareness-free method for ECG monitoring.
