5|$|Dao: Daos are single-edged Chinese swords, {{primarily}} {{used for}} slashing and <b>chopping.</b> The {{most common form}} {{is also known as}} the Chinese sabre, although those with wider blades are sometimes referred to as Chinese broadswords. In China, the dao {{is considered one of the}} four traditional weapons, along with the gun (stick or staff), qiang (spear), and the jian (sword). The earliest dao date from the Shang Dynasty in China's Bronze Age, and are known as zhibeidao (直背刀)– straight backed knives. As the name implies, these were straight-bladed or slightly curved weapons with a single edge. Originally bronze, these weapons were made of iron or steel by the time of the late Warring States period as metallurgical knowledge became sufficiently advanced to control the carbon content. Originally less common as a military weapon than the jian– the straight, double-edged blade of China– the dao became popular with cavalry during the Han dynasty due to its sturdiness, superiority as a <b>chopping</b> weapon, and relative ease of use– it was generally said that it takes a week to attain competence with a dao/saber, a month to attain competence with a qiang/spear, and a year to attain competence with a jian/straight sword. Soon after dao began to be issued to infantry, beginning the replacement of the jian as a standard-issue weapon. Late Han dynasty dao had round grips and ring-shaped pommels, and ranged between 85 and 114 centimeters in length. These weapons were used alongside rectangular shields.|$|E

5|$|Alternative {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} for the diet of aetosaurs.

A 2009 study of the jaw biomechanics of the South American genus Neoaetosauroides suggested that the animal may have fed on larvae and insects without hard exoskeletons. This is because Neoaetosauroides lacks serrations or wear facets on the teeth and has a jaw leverage that is not designed for strong forces such as crushing and <b>chopping.</b> The study recognized that northern aetosaurs such as Desmatosuchus and Stagonolepis did have jaws that would have supported a strong musculature, and were likely better suited to eating plant material.|$|E

5|$|Freshly cut onions often cause a {{stinging}} sensation {{in the eyes}} of people nearby, and often uncontrollable tears. This is caused by the release of a volatile gas, syn-propanethial-S-oxide, which stimulates nerves in the eye creating {{a stinging}} sensation. This gas is produced by a chain of reactions which serve as a defence mechanism: <b>chopping</b> an onion causes damage to cells which releases enzymes called alliinases. These break down amino acid sulfoxides and generate sulfenic acids. A specific sulfenic acid, 1-propenesulfenic acid, is rapidly acted on by a second enzyme, the lacrimatory factor synthase, producing the syn-propanethial-S-oxide. This gas diffuses through the air and soon reaches the eyes, where it activates sensory neurons. Lacrimal glands produce tears to dilute and flush out the irritant.|$|E

40|$|Background and Aims: C/EBP {{homologous}} protein (<b>CHOP)</b> plays pro-apoptotic {{roles in the}} integrated stress response. Recently, a tumor suppressive role for <b>CHOP</b> was demonstrated in lung cancer via regulation of tumor metabolism. To explore the role of <b>CHOP</b> in hepatocarcinogenesis, we induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in wild type (wt) and <b>CHOP</b> knockout (KO) mice using the carcinogen N-diethylnitrosamine (DEN). Results: Analysis of tumor development showed reduced tumor load, with markedly smaller tumor nodules in the <b>CHOP</b> KO animals, suggesting oncogenic roles of <b>CHOP</b> in carcinogen-induced HCC. In wt tumors, <b>CHOP</b> was exclusively expressed in tumor tissue, with minimal expression in normal parenchyma. Analysis of human adenocarcinomas of various origins demonstrated scattered expression of <b>CHOP</b> in the tumors, pointing to relevance in human pathology. Characterization of pathways that may contribute to preferential expression of <b>CHOP</b> in the tumor identified ATF 6 as a potential candidate. ATF 6, a key member of the endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling machinery, exhibited a similar pattern of expression as <b>CHOP</b> and strong activation in wt but not <b>CHOP</b> KO tumors. Because HCC is induced by chronic inflammation, we assessed whether <b>CHOP</b> deficiency affects tumor-immune system crosstalk. We found {{that the number of}} macrophages and levels of IFNc and CCL 4 mRNA were markedly reduced in tumors from <b>CHOP</b> KO relative to wt mice, suggesting a role for <b>CHOP</b> in modulating tumor microenvironment and macrophage recruitment to the tumor...|$|R
40|$|Upon {{exposure}} to environmental stress, phosphorylation of the α subunit of eIF 2 (eIF 2 α-P) represses global protein synthesis, coincident with preferential translation of gene transcripts that mitigate stress damage or alternatively trigger apoptosis. Because {{there are multiple}} mammalian eIF 2 kinases, each responding to different stress arrangements, this translational control scheme {{is referred to as}} the integrated stress response (ISR). Included among the preferentially translated mRNAs induced by eIF 2 α-P is that encoding the transcription factor <b>CHOP</b> (DDIT 3 /GADD 153). Enhanced levels of <b>CHOP</b> promote cell death when ISR signaling is insufficient to restore cell homeostasis. Preferential translation of <b>CHOP</b> mRNA occurs by a mechanism involving ribosome bypass of an inhibitory upstream ORF (uORF) situated in the 5 '-leader of the <b>CHOP</b> mRNA. In this study, we used biochemical and genetic approaches to define the inhibitory features of the <b>CHOP</b> uORF and the biological consequences of loss of the <b>CHOP</b> uORF on <b>CHOP</b> expression during stress. We discovered that specific sequences within the <b>CHOP</b> uORF serve to stall elongating ribosomes and prevent ribosome reinitiation at the downstream <b>CHOP</b> coding sequence. As a consequence, deletion of the <b>CHOP</b> uORF substantially increases the levels and modifies the pattern of induction of <b>CHOP</b> expression in the ISR. Enhanced <b>CHOP</b> expression leads to increased expression of key <b>CHOP</b> target genes, culminating in increased cell death in response to stress...|$|R
