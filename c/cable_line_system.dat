40|$|Abstract [...] This paper, {{presents}} {{the effect of}} a <b>cable</b> <b>line</b> on the maximum overvoltage location along <b>cable</b> <b>line</b> and reliability indices in the power system with the combined transmission line (overhead line/cable line). Maximum overvoltage has a vital role in insulators design of high voltage cable. On the other hand, recently with the extension of power systems, maintaining the high degree service reliability is very important. High voltage cable insulations have undesirable effect on power system reliability. Therefore, in this study, the effect of <b>cable</b> <b>line</b> length and the number of span before a <b>cable</b> <b>line</b> are investigated on the amount and location of maximum overvoltage. Furthrmore, reliability indices are determined by changing length and age of a <b>cable</b> <b>line</b> in combined transmission line. Results show that <b>cable</b> <b>line</b> length does not change the maximum overvoltage location but has significantly effect on the amount of maximum overvoltage.

40|$|To {{meet the}} {{required}} operation speed for protection of meshed voltage source converter (VSC) high voltage direct current (HVDC) grids, traveling wave-based algorithms {{operating in the}} sub-millisecond time-frame must be used. The domain in which these algorithms operate, i. e., modal or phase, determines their performance in fault discrimination, fault type classification and faulted pole selection. In the recent literature, high-speed algorithms have been proposed for various VSC HVDC grid configurations and transmission line types; yet the choice of domain has received insufficient attention. This paper offers recommendations for the choice of domain for protection algorithm design of HVDC overhead <b>line</b> or <b>cable</b> <b>systems</b> in symmetric monopolar and bipolar configurations. The theoretical analysis of this paper, {{which is based on}} fundamental wave propagation theory, indicates that the most computationally efficient domain for protection algorithms for <b>cable</b> and overhead <b>line</b> <b>systems</b> are the phase and modal, respectively. Furthermore, the paper provides comprehensive guidelines to construct detection functions for both configurations and discusses the errors introduced by approximations.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper the authors {{investigate}} steady-state capabilities of very long EHVAC underground <b>cable</b> <b>lines,</b> without intermediate compensating stations, installed in meshed networks. Analytical formulas of cable length-loading relationship are presented to this purpose. The study shows that, in optimal operating conditions, most of the ampacity of such long underground <b>cable</b> <b>lines</b> can be exploited for active power transmission. Non-optimal operating envelopes are studied, showing the effect of terminal voltages and <b>line</b> losses on <b>cable</b> utilization and evidencing limited derating under realistic hypotheses. A parametric analysis of loading limits and possible voltage violations along the cable is shown; a simple criterion for optimal utilization of lossy <b>cable</b> <b>lines</b> is also proposed. Line-end shunt compensation requirements for integration of long EHVAC <b>cable</b> <b>lines</b> in transmission networks are then specified.

As an indicator of the reliability of the <b>cable</b> <b>line</b> the maximum mean time to failure (the value inversely proportional to the parameter of succession of failures), which is an order more for <b>cable</b> <b>lines</b> with XLPE insulation than for <b>cable</b> <b>lines</b> with paper insulation, is adopted. A comprehensive {{assessment of}} the convenience of installation of <b>cable</b> <b>lines</b> revealed that the installation of cable with XLPE insulation features a 1. 2 – 1. 6 times easier installation as compared to three-wire (voltage 10 kW) and 1. 4 times easier installation as compared to single-core oil-filled cables (voltage of 110 kW).
