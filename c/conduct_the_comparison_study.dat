40|$|Nasal spray, as an {{alternative}} drug delivery method rather than oral medication approach, can solve the formulation break-down in the digestive system and the detox within the liver system. Moreover, human airway drug delivery method has a better level of patient compliance in <b>comparison</b> with <b>the</b> intravenous methods, especially among children. In order to improve {{the performance of the}} nasal spray, it is necessary to investigate the external characteristics of atomized particles from these pharmaceutical spray devices. However, the studies for low pressure applications are left barely touched. Owing to the narrow passage structure, it is not feasible to conduct accurate in vivo experiment regarding particle deposition study. Meanwhile in vitro experiment can magnify the tiny nasal cavity for a better visualization, but with some drawbacks that can affect the accuracy of experimental outcome. Therefore, CFD simulation helps to solve this puzzle, however literature research found out that the previous studies neglect the initial particle characteristics. In this thesis, the detailed external characteristics of atomized particles after atomization for low pressure conditions are presented. Two commercial pharmaceutical spray devices were tested with different methods. The experiments were performed in three stages. The first stage was to mimic the real human actuation parameters by using lab equipment. The second stage was to capture the outline and break-up length of the spray cone during the fully developed stage and within the region between the nozzle and first break-up length. High Speed Camera (HSC) and spotlight were adopted to obtain the required data. The third stage was to study the droplet size and velocity distributions by using particle image velocimetry (PIV) and particle/droplet image analysis (PDIA). Furthermore, all these realistic results, gained from experimental study, were derived to form the boundary conditions, to be applied in the numerical study via CFD simulation for the first time. In the numerical study of this thesis, the conventional and a newly designed device were compared regarding the deposition fraction and the penetration depth. For the conventional device, laminar and turbulent flows were used under the inhalation rate of 15 L/min and two spray cones with four different particle sizes were utilised. In the parametric study of this thesis, the spray alignment was included. Three different spray directions were chosen to compare, where the middle direction was set as the reference. For the newly designed one, similar methodology and procedure was performed, but with a down scaled set of considerations and a new visualization technique. One device was used with both laminar and turbulent flows and four different sized particles. Since the particles deposited in both left and right chambers, the UV-unwrapping technique was adopted for better visualization. After <b>conducting</b> <b>the</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>study,</b> two sets of optimal spray parameters were drawn for each generation of the nasal spray device. Simultaneously, the newly designed device, claimed with noticeable advantages if compared to the conventional devices, was examined in terms of deposition fraction and the relative particle penetration depth in the middle lateral region...|$|R
40|$|Using psychophysical studies, {{the authors}} have {{evaluated}} the effectiveness of various strategies for compensating for physical degradations in SPECT imaging. The particular application was Ga- 67 -citrate imaging of mediastinal tumors, which was chosen because Ga- 67 is a particularly challenging radionuclide for imaging. The test strategies included compensations for nonuniform attenuation, distance-dependent spatial resolution, and scatter applied in various combinations as part of iterative reconstructions with the rescaled block iterative-expectation maximization (RBI-EM) algorithm. The authors also evaluated filtered backprojection reconstructions. Strategies were compared {{on the basis of}} human-observer studies of lesion localization and detection accuracy using the localization receiver operating characteristics (LROC) paradigm. These studies involved hybrid images which were obtained by adding the projections of Monte Carlo-simulated lesions to disease-free clinical projection data. The background variability in these images can provide a more realistic assessment of the relative utility of reconstruction strategies than images from anthropomorphic digital phantoms. The clinical datasets were obtained using a GE-VG dual-detector SPECT system with CT-estimated attenuation maps. After determining a target lesion contrast, they conducted pilot LROC studies to obtain a near-optimal set of reconstruction parameters for each strategy, and then <b>conducted</b> <b>the</b> strategy <b>comparison</b> <b>study.</b> <b>The</b> results indicate improved detection accuracy with RBI-EM as more compensations are applied within the reconstruction. The relative rankings of the test strategies agreed in most cases with those of previous studies that employed simulated projections of digital anthropomorphic phantoms, thus confirming the findings of those studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to introduce new advanced statistical methods for analysing gene expression profiles to consequently enhance our understanding of the spatial gradients of the proteins produced by genes in a gene regulatory network (GRN). To that end, {{this research}} has three main contributions. In this thesis, the segmentation Network (SN) in Drosophila melanogaster and the bicoid gene (bcd) as the critical input of this network are targeted to study. The first contribution {{of this research is}} to introduce a new noise filtering and signal processing algorithm based on Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) for extracting the signal of bicoid gene. Using the proposed SSA algorithm which is based on the minimum variance estimator, the extraction of bcd signal from its noisy profile is considerably improved compared to the most widely accepted model, Synthesis Diffusion Degradation (SDD). The achieved results are evaluated via both simulation studies and empirical results. Given the reliance of this research towards introducing an improved signal extraction approach, it is mandatory to compare the proposed method with the other well-known and widely used signal processing models. Therefore, the results are compared with a range of parametric and non-parametric signal processing methods. <b>The</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>study</b> confirmed <b>the</b> outperformance of the SSA technique. Having the superior performance of SSA, in the second contribution, the SSA signal extraction performance is optimised using several novel computational methods including window length and eigenvalue identification approaches, Sequential and Hybrid SSA and SSA based on Colonial Theory. Each introduced method successfully improves a particular aspect of the SSA signal extraction procedure. The third and final contribution of this research aims at extracting the regulatory role of the maternal effect genes in SN using a variety of causality detection techniques. The hybrid algorithm developed here successfully portrays the interactions which have been previously accredited via laboratory experiments and therefore, suggests a new analytical view to the GRNs...|$|R
