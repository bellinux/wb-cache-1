40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} {{dedicated}} to the geometry selection of a redundantly actuated cable-suspended parallel robot intended to manipulate heavy payloads over a wide workspace. Cable-suspended refers here to cable-driven parallel robots in a crane-like setting, where all the <b>cable</b> <b>drawing</b> points are located on top of the base frame, gravity being used to keep the cables taut. Geometry selection consists of determining the relative positions of the <b>cable</b> <b>drawing</b> points on the base frame and of the cable attachment points on the mobile platform together with the cable arrangement between these two sets of points. An original performance index is introduced. It is defined as the maximum acceptable distance between the mobile platform geometric center and the center of mass of the set consisting of the platform and a payload. This performance index is of particular interest in heavy payload handling applications. Used within a two-phase geometry selection strategy, it yields a new cable-suspended robot geometry having a very large workspace to footprint ratio and able to handle heavy payloads. A large-dimension redundantly actuated cable-suspended robot was built in order to demonstrate these capabilities...|$|R

40|$|In today’s {{industry}} it {{is starting}} to {{get more and more}} interesting with wireless systems and solutions for applications. To be able {{to reduce the amount of}} <b>cables</b> <b>drawn</b> to various machines which takes both space and an extra fee for every <b>cable</b> <b>drawn.</b> Some systems might require the user to use a handheld device that is directly connected by a cable which in some machines might be inelegant for the user. The goal with this bachelor thesis is to develop wireless monitoring of the machine operators position that is working with heavy industrial machinery. The thesis started out with researching different techniques for positioning a transmitter indoors, this was done in order to get a better understanding on how to go about. The technique that was chosen is positioning a transmitter by checking where the peak in signal strength is at its highest, this is done by rotating a parabolic reflector around the receiver’s antenna. The result is a solution to monitor the position of an operator at a rolling machine. The solutions function is to check at which angle the operator is currently positioned. By comparing this angle to the angles that is considered to be inside a dangerous zone, the system can determine if the operator is inside of that zone or not. ...|$|R

40|$|Four {{types of}} <b>cable</b> <b>drawn</b> farming systems, a single engine system, a double engine system, a {{perimeter}} system, and a double implement system, were analyzed {{to determine which}} was best suited for Arizona. The systems were compared in terms of relative cost, reliability/simplicity and field capacity. Field capacity computation variables were implement width, implement speed, tower travel speed, implement carrier travel speed, and implement rotation time. The analysis showed the single engine system was the least expensive, simplest system with a field capacity identical {{to that of the}} double engine system, eight percent lower than the double implement system, and approximately thirteen percent higher than the perimeter system. Based on these results, the single implement system was judged superior to the others. The parameters affecting single implement system performance were then examined to optimize performance. The evaluation yielded a recommendation that the system be designed to have a tower speed of 48 ft/min, and a rotation time of 7. 5 seconds. A positioning system for the mobile truss of a <b>cable</b> <b>drawn</b> farming system was also developed and tested. The system used a linear move irrigation system's above ground cable guidance system for steering, a wicket positioning system for stopping the machine at the indexing locations, and a wire-alignment system to control inner tower alignment. The system was tested over a length of 280 ft using a five tower, 575 ft long, linear move irrigation system. It was found that the above ground cable guidance system provided ± 0. 5 ft steering accuracy, the wicket positioning system controlled the power unit and end tower position within ± 0. 2 ft of the target destination, and that the wire alignment system controlled inner tower position within ± 0. 3 ft of the target destination. Statistical analysis of the test results showed the probability of position error being controlled to within ± 0. 4 ft and ± 0. 8 ft to be at the 99. 7 % and 99. 99 % confidence levels, respectively...|$|R

The cable is lowered into the river when the ferry is not operational and is stretched across the river during hours of operation. There is sufficient clearance for small boats to pass under the cable, but it is lowered when barges pass, though barge traffic on the Cape Fear river in this section ceased in the 1990s. The ferry {{is powered by a}} diesel engine and a propeller. Stopping is controlled by the operator's throttle. As the ferry cannot turn around, each end includes a ramp, and alignment of the ferry at each end is automatic.|$|R

We explored the use of a disposable MWD telemetry <b>cable,</b> <b>drawing</b> on the technology developed for missile guidance which deploys miles of fiber from a small spool at missile speeds approaching half the speed of sound.

50|$|The Tame Valley {{generating}} station {{consisted of three}} Yates and Thom, 815hp, vertical triple expansion steam engines. Each engine driving a Dick, Kerr & Co. 500kW, 60 pole alternator at 80rpm, giving a three-phase output of 6,000V at 40Hz. The station's six Lancashire boilers were supplied by Tinker, Shenton & Co, of Hyde. Most of the electrical switchgear was supplied by Witting, Eborall & Co. Power from the station was distributed at 6,000V via specially made three core <b>cables</b> <b>drawn</b> through glazed earthenware underground conduits. Each of the four SHMD towns had its own substation consisting of two sychronous motor generators, each rated at 200kW, converting the 6,000V three-phase input into an output of 525V dc to feed the overhead tram wires and 460V (±230V) three-wire dc for lighting circuits.
