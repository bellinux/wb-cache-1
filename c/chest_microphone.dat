Lung sound is monitored using a <b>chest</b> <b>microphone</b> from what after a filtering process we extract {{the information that}} contribute to four types of lung disease detection. We use the wavelet coefficients in order to extract the patterns that identify the lung disease. Neuro-fuzzy decision system implemented software is used in order to detect and alert the patient. A wireless communication based bluetoothTM chip is used to connect a {{wearable device}} to micro server that uses the TCP/IP protocol in order {{to communicate with the}} medic. Experimentally results are presented and future research direction is taken into account. Key-Words: lung sound, reconfigurable hardware, wavelets, neuro-fuzzy inference system, wearable devic...|$|E
