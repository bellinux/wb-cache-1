40|$|Aim: To {{identify}} the situational and offender characteristics associated with prison sentences for Apprehended Domestic Violence Order (ADVO) breaches. Method: Case narratives from police incident reports of ADVO breach incidents in NSW were analysed. Two samples were examined: (1) breach incidents where the offender involved was imprisoned (n= 250) and (2) breach incidents where the offender involved received a non-custodial sentence (n= 250). The {{nature of the}} breach and the characteristics of persons involved in these two breach samples were compared using descriptive data and logistic regression models. Results: The majority of ADVO breaches in both samples involved male to female offending in spousal/ex-spousal relationships, occurred in the victim’s house and involved face-to-face contact. Compared with offenders in the non-prison group, {{a higher proportion of}} offenders who received a <b>custodial</b> <b>penalty</b> for the breach ADVO matter were male, Indigenous, had 5 or more prior court appearances (including prior offences for domestic violence (DV), assault and breach ADVO), had 3 or more prior prison penalties and had breached two or more conditions of their order. Breaches resulting in prison also had a higher proportion of matters involving physical assault, property damage, psychological aggression and parties who had a history of violence. After controlling for other factors, the following factors were independently associated with imprisonment for ADVO; the offender’s gender, prior imprisonment, prior proven DV offence, history of violence, involvement of physical assault in the breach, victim/offender relationship and residing with the victim. Conclusion: The profile of offenders who receive imprisonment for a breach ADVO offence is significantly different from those who receive a non-custodial penalty for these offences. The nature of the breach and the circumstances surrounding the event also vary for matters where prison is imposed for an ADVO breach...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{results from}} a survey of public attitudes towards juvenile crime and the treatment of juvenile offenders in Romania. The study is based on research conducted {{as part of an}} MSc in Community Safety at Leicester University. Studies examining public opinion and crime are new to Romania – indeed, this survey represents the first attempt to explore such subjects. Results show that public opinion is inconsistent, with ambivalent attitudes about juvenile crime and sentencing; people concurrently favour retribution and tougher sentences for juvenile offenders, while supporting elements of restorative justice and non <b>custodial</b> <b>penalties.</b> Explanations for such contradictory views include inaccurate knowledge about juvenile crime, prejudices and distorted media reporting...|$|R
50|$|The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) defines {{decriminalization}} as {{the removal}} of a conduct or activity from the sphere of criminal law; depenalisation signifying merely a relaxation of the penal sanction exacted by law. Decriminalization usually applies to offences related to drug consumption and may include either the imposition of sanctions {{of a different kind}} (administrative) or the abolition of all sanctions; other (noncriminal) laws then regulate the conduct or activity that has been decriminalized. Depenalisation usually consists of personal consumption as well as small-scale trading and generally signifies the elimination or reduction of <b>custodial</b> <b>penalties,</b> while the conduct or activity still remains a criminal offence. The term legalization refers to {{the removal of}} all drug-related offences from criminal law: use, possession, cultivation, production, trading, etc.|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} analyses {{the current}} Italian prison system, {{which has been}} called upon to resolve its structural problems. In 2013, The Council of Europe condemned Italy for inhuman treatment in its prisons. The principal accusation concerns the problem of overcrowding. The country has responded with solutions such as {{the application of the}} open system, which provides cells that are used exclusively for sleeping in at night, and dynamic monitoring, an effective system for ensuring order in the institutions. These initiatives aim to promote re-educational activities and the social re-integration of prisoners. In addition, Italian institutions have made greater use of alternatives to <b>custodial</b> <b>penalties</b> in order to tackle overcrowding and to provide more opportunities for re-integration. This contribution focuses on the need to increase prisoners’ employment opportunities. In fact, Italy seems to have neglected this area, which is fundamental for re-integration into the community sphere...|$|R
40|$|Foreword Studies of the {{specific}} deterrent effect of criminal sanctions have mostly focused on prison. This is, in some ways, unfortunate as non-custodial penalties are far more frequently imposed than <b>custodial</b> <b>penalties.</b> In this study, the authors use propensity score matching to assess whether {{the length of a}} bond or suspended sentence makes any difference to the time to first new offence. The results suggest that it does and that offenders given long bonds or suspended sentences take longer to reoffend than offenders given short bonds or suspended sentences. These findings have significant implications for sentencing policy. However, as is highlighted, although the study controlled {{for a wide range of}} factors, results may have been affected by unmeasured differences between those who received long bonds or suspended sentences and those who received short bonds or suspended sentences. Further research is necessary before it is clear whether longer bonds and suspended sentences would be effective in reducing the overall rate of reoffending...|$|R
40|$|Many jurisdictions have {{developed}} mature infrastructures, both administratively and legislatively, to promote competition. Substantial {{funds have been}} expended to monitor activities that are anticompetitive and many jurisdictions also have adopted a form of "Cartel Leniency Program", first developed by the US Federal Trade Commission, to assist in cartel detection. Further, some jurisdictions are now criminalizing cartel behaviour so that cartel participants can be held criminally liable with substantial <b>custodial</b> <b>penalties</b> imposed. Notwithstanding these multijurisdictional approaches, {{a new form of}} possibly anticompetitive behaviour is looming. Synergistic monopolies („synopolies‟) involve not competitors within a horizontal market but complimentors within separate vertical markets. Where two complimentary corporations are monopolists in their own market they can, through various technologies, assist each other to expand their respective monopolies thus creating a barrier to new entrants and/or blocking existing participants from further participation in that market. The nature of the technologies involved means that it is easy for this potentially anti-competitive activity to enter and affect the global marketplace. Competition regulators {{need to be aware of}} this potential for abuse and ensure that their respective competition frameworks appropriately address this activity. This paper discusses how new technologies can be used to create a synopoly...|$|R
40|$|This {{summary of}} the most {{important}} results of this study is set up by answering the different questions in which this study’s theses consists (7. 2). The preceding chapters’ most important findings can be presented adequately and orderly by answering the theses. The three questions of which the theses consists will therefore be presented first (7. 1). The current chapter will end with a short conclusion (7. 3). 7. 1 Back to the theses In chapter 1 answering the following three questions was presented as goal of the current research. What is the meaning of the terrorist offence, the terrorist intent and the increase of <b>custodial</b> <b>penalties</b> of the Terrorist offences act from a criminal law perspective and how do they fit in the system of Dutch criminal law? How does the Terrorist offences act extend punishability for terrorist offences and how should these extensions be appreciated from a criminal law perspective? In which way does the terrorist offences act relate to prior penalizations of terrorism and what is the sentence that can actually be imposed for terrorist offences when a single attack consists of several acts or when a single act constitutes several terrorist offences...|$|R
40|$|On the 23 June 2006 the {{operative}} {{provisions of the}} Fisheries Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fishing Offences) Act 2006 (Cth) (the amending Act) came into force. The main purpose of the amending Act is to introduce <b>custodial</b> <b>penalties</b> for foreign fishing offences which are committed in Australia’s territorial sea. In so doing, the legislative drafters have acknowledged the legal distinction between the regimes of the territorial sea and the exclusive economic zone (EEZ). That is, the fact that under international law a coastal State may impose {{the full force of}} its criminal laws within the territorial sea whilst within the EEZ the coastal State’s rights in relation to the enforcement of its fisheries laws are limited by Art 73 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC). In terms of the fight against the persistent and increasing numbers of illegal foreign fishers visiting Australia’s waters, the distinction is long overdue. Whether the risk of incurring a custodial sentence will actually deter foreign fishers remains to be seen. In the interim, {{there are a number of}} observations to be made in relation to the amending Act. These observations are best appreciated when considered in the context of the legal framework under which Australian fisheries are managed, together with a brief account of the significant increase in the numbers of illegal fishers being sighted in the northern waters of the Australian Fishing Zone (AFZ) ...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{findings from}} a research study {{commissioned by the}} Youth Justice Board to identify the relative seriousness of offenses leading to custody and other high level penalties {{in a range of}} areas where differential patterns of custodial sentencing prevailed. Criminal statistics for England and Wales reveal substantial geographic variation in the pattern of youth sentencing. Statistics to the Youth Justice Board (YJB) provides evidence of this variation. This research study, commissioned by the YJB, explored any relationship between the use of high tariff disposal, with a particular emphasis on <b>custodial</b> <b>penalties,</b> and a range of possible influences upon patterns of sentencing. The study specifically investigated the distribution of sentences below the level of custody, case gravity, including the seriousness of current offending and previous convictions, the perceived range and quality of local youth justice services to support court orders short of custody, and the effectiveness of communication between the youth offending team and the court and the exchange of information between agencies involved in the delivery of youth justice. Highlights of key findings on distinguishing characteristics typical of high and low custody areas include for low custody areas: (1) greater use of lower level penalties; (2) lower use of community sentences; (3) greater use of unconditional bail; (4) magistrates express greater confidence in delivery of services; and (5) pre-sentence reports more effective as a mechanism for provision of information. Highlights of key findings for high custody areas include: (1) lower use of lower level penalties; (2) higher use of community penalties; (3) lower average case gravity scores for community sentences; (4) magistrates express reduced confidence in delivery of services; and (5) pre-sentence reports less effective as a mechanism for provision of information.

40|$|Pre-sentence or pre-sanction reports (PSRs) provide judges with {{information}} on the personal circumstances, background and attitude of a defendant, an assessment of risk of reoffending, and typically include sentence recommendations 1. Yet despite their potential {{to contribute to the}} sentencing process in Ireland, we know relatively little about how PSRs are constructed in practice, when and in what circumstances they are requested, how probation officers construct and ‘craft’ their report, how judges view or interpret the contents of the report, and perhaps most significantly, the impact that such reports have on sentencing practice. Previous sentencing research has shown that social and moral reasoning, in the form of information about the character, personality and circumstances of an individual, can be highly influential in sentencing, especially when judges are choosing between <b>custodial</b> and non-custodial <b>penalties</b> (Tombs and Jagger, 2006; Millie et al., 2007; Maguire, 2008; Tata et al., 2008; Beyens and Scheirs, 2010; Phoenix, 2010). While legal factors are also important, research shows that judicial interpretations of the offender’s character and attitude, as well as their interpretations of certain aspects of an individual’s personal and social circumstances, including employment and relationship status, are influential in terms of their decision to impose either a <b>custodial</b> or non-custodial <b>penalty</b> (Tombs and Jagger, 2006; Millie et al., 2007; Maguire, 2008, 2010, 2011). The type of information provided in pre-sentence reports is also the type of information that is influential in sentencing, however, to date there has been no research in the Irish context exploring the relationship between pre-sentence reports and sentencing. Similarly, the contribution that probation officers make to sentencing, through the provision of PSRs, is relatively unexplored (Carr and Maguire, 2012). Traditionally the role of the probation officer {{in the criminal justice system}} was considered to be more welfare than control oriented (Healy, 2015; Carr, 2016). Given this practice perspective and the history of the development of probation (i. e. as an alternative to custody) (McNally, 2007; 2009), probation officers would be expected to recommend the use of non-custodial over custodial sanctions. Similarly, pre-sentence reports would be expected to focus on the social aspects of the defendant’s situation and to contain information which would assist consideration of the appropriateness of a community based sanction. More recently it has been argued that more emphasis has been placed on control elements in probation practice in response to policy changes that have foregrounded public protection (Fitzgibbon et al., 2010). In Ireland, this is illustrated by the introduction of risk assessment tools in 2004 and by the increasing importance that the Probation Service places on the need to protect the community and provide for public safety (Richardson, 2008; Bracken, 2010; Healy, 2015). An important question is the extent to which pre-sentence reports now prioritise risk assessment over other forms of information and if this is the case, the influence that this may have on judicial sentencing practices. Pre-sentence reports also represent a key point of exchange between two distinct professional groups within the criminal justice system. Probation officers and judges have very different professional backgrounds and training and are likely to view issues from different perspectives. Previous research has explored pre-sentence reports as a form of communication between report writers and judges (Tata et al., 2008; Beyens and Scheirs, 2010; Wandall, 2010). This research is similarly focused on pre-sentence reports as a form of communication between report writers and judges and an important question which we explore is the extent to which the processes of communication embodied in the reports align with the specific aims and objectives of those writing the reports and with the expectations of those receiving and interpreting the reports...|$|R

Nagrinėjama individualizavimo, teisingumo principo reikšmė, skiriant bausmę. Analizuojamos teisės aktų nuostatos, reglamentuojančios bausmės tikslus, laisvės apribojimo bausmės skyrimą ir vykdymą, probacijos tarnybų paskirtį taikant šią bausmę. Tiriami praktiniai atvejai, kuomet skiriama laisvės apriojimo bausmė ir kaip užtikrinamas teisingumas – bausmės paskirties įgyvendinimas, taip pat situacijos, kuomet ji keičiama kita bausme (nepavykus įgyvendinti bausmės tikslų), analizuojama statistika ir šios bausmės vieta valstybės teisinėje sistemoje. Europos bausmių politika eina kryptinga linkme mažinant realios laisvės atėmimo bausmės skyrimą nuteistiesiems, taip mažindami kalinių skaičių ir siekdami efektyvios nuteistųjų socializacijos, integracijos į visuomenę, kurie pripažįsta teisinių normų egzistavimą, vykdant bausmę priimtinoje aplinkoje su tam tikrais suvaržymais. Įpareigojimai padeda taisyti elgesį ir požiūrį, daugeliu atveju – įgalūs užtikrinti, bausmės tikslų įgyvendinimą. Buvo analizuojama, kokiu būdu siekiama kiekvieną bendrąjį bausmės tikslą įgyvendinti taikant šią bausmę. Siekiant užtikrinti proporcingumo ir teisingumo principus, dažniausiai asmenims teisiamiems pirmą kartą už ne tokius sunkius nusikaltimus, teismas pagrįstai renkasi laisvės apribojimo bausmės rūšį, taikydamas įpareigojimus ir draudimus, kurie nukreipti į konkretaus asmens elgesio koregavimą. Dažnai susiduriama su problema, kad dalies nuteistųjų ši bausmė neveikia ir tenka keisti griežtesne bausme – areštu, kuri pati kaip bausmė – trumpalaikis sulaikymas nėra veiksminga. Kai bausmė netinkamai vykdoma ar nevykdoma – teismai keisdami bausmės rūšį turi teisę laisvai interpretuoti sąvoką „vengimas“ atlikti bausmę, todėl vertėtų nustatyti labiau apibrėžtus kriterijus, kada probacijos tarnyboms kreiptis dėl bausmės keitimo, nes šiuo metu daugelis teikimų lieka netenkinti. Išanalizavus mokslinę literatūrą, užsienio bei Lietuvos teisės aktus, Lietuvos teismų praktiką, daroma išvada, kad sutartinai daugelyje šalių bausmė nukreipta į: nubaudimą, bendrąją prevenciją ir reabilitaciją, todėl ne tokių sunkių nusikalstamų veikų atvejais galime taikyti bausmę, kuri labiau orientuota į asmens ankstesnio gyvenimo keitimą, imantis realių veiksmų (gydomųjų programų kitos pagalbos, individualizuotų įpareigojimų nustatymo). Nustatyta, kad viena pažangiausių kriminalinių bausmių, veikianti kaip savotiška nuteistųjų resocializacijos priemonė – laisvės apribojimo bausmė, Baudžiamajame kodekse egzistuoja pagrįstai, nes nuteistiesiems teikiant pagalbą ir taikant įpareigojimus galima pasiekti bausmės tikslus, nors ir ne pilna apimtimi, nes neįmanoma užtikrinti absoliutaus bausmės įgyvendinimo visų nuteistųjų atvejais, bet remiantis duomenimis matoma, kad didžioji dalis asmenų įvykdo bausmę pilna apimtimi ir realu tikėtis, jog jos vykdymas padeda padaryti išvadas dėl veiksmų ateityje. The {{aim of the}} Master {{thesis is}} to {{determine}} whether the application of <b>custodial</b> or non-custodial <b>penalty</b> of restriction of liberty is adequate and sufficient measure to achieve the common goals of punishment in various offenses cases, and whether this punishment is effective and reasonably exists in the Criminal Code of the Republic of Lithuania. The thesis analyzes the concept of punishment, the meaning of individualization and equity principles when sentencing. The Master thesis also analyzes the legislative provisions governing the objectives of the penalty established in Article 41 of the Criminal Code, the punishment of restriction of liberty set forth in Article 48 of the Criminal Code and the enforcement provided for in Article 47 of the Penal Code. The thesis provides a comparison of the general objectives of punishment and the objectives of the punishment of restriction of liberty, the thesis analyzes whether all the objectives can be achieved. The thesis studies practical cases in which a penalty of restriction of liberty has been imposed and how it has been enforced, the thesis also studies the situations when such penalty is replaced by another penalty (in case of the failure to implement the objectives of punishment), the Master thesis analyses statistics and the place of this punishment in the state legal system. The aim of the thesis is to answer the question whether the purpose for punishment of restriction of liberty ensures the implementation of the goals of punishment. The European penal policy is going in the purposeful direction towards reducing the punishment of an actual custodial sentence, thus reducing the number of prisoners and seeking the effective socialization of convicted persons and their integration into society. The individuals who recognize the existence of legal norms carry out the punishment in an acceptable environment with certain restrictions, which both help to correct the behavior and attitudes, and are able to ensure the realization of the objectives of punishment. Therefore, the thesis has analyzed the manner in which each of the common purposes of the punishment has been implemented when applying this penalty. In order to ensure the principles of proportionality and fairness, in most cases the court reasonably chooses the types of penalties for restriction of liberty for the accused persons, who are being sentenced for the first time for less serious crimes, by applying obligations and prohibitions directed at the particular individual’s correction and adequate implementation of the punishment goals. The most often problem {{is that some of the}} convicted persons are not affected by this punishment and it has to be replaced by a severe penalty – arrest, which as the punishment - a short-term detention, is not efficient. When the penalty is executed improperly or is not executed at all, changing the type of penalty the courts are free to interpret the concept of “avoidance” to carry out the sentence, therefore it would be advisable to set some more specific criteria based on which the probation service should apply for sentence modification, because currently many submissions remain not satisfied. The analysis of scientific literature, foreign and Lithuanian legislation, case law, leads to the conclusion that in many countries the punishment is directed to: punishment, general prevention and rehabilitation, therefore in cases of less serious offences we can apply a punishment that is more focused on the change of the person's previous life by taking real actions (healing programs, other assistance, determination of individualized obligations). It has been found out that one of the most advanced criminal penalties acting as a sort of re-socialization measure of the convicts - the penalty of restriction of liberty – reasonably exists in the Criminal Code of the Republic of Lithuania because by providing aid and applying obligations to the convicts the punishment goals can be achieved, though not to the full extent, because it is impossible to guarantee the absolute implementation of the punishment in all cases, but the information shows that most of the convicts execute the sentence to the full extent and it is realistic to expect that its implementation helps to draw conclusions for the future actions. Recommendations: in order to ensure that the punishment goals are achieved at the higher extent as possible, that the sentence has a real impact on convicts, it is suggested to establish in the Criminal and Penal Codes that in case of failure to carry out the sentence of restriction of liberty or in case of realizing that it is not effective, or that other measures would be more effective, the prohibitions or restrictions to the convict shall be revised or supplemented, if the obligations are carried out offhandedly, when it is possible to extend their implementation. What is more, to provide the possibility to change the penalty of restriction of liberty into not only arrest, but also into a fine. It is believed that it would be a more effective measure as it has been proven that a short-term arrest is not an effective punishment, while at least some people are concerned about their financial situation, therefore it is likely that they would make a greater effort to dutifully carry out the prohibitions and obligations imposed by the penalty of restriction of liberty. It is also advisable to clearly define the concept of what is considered to be “avoidance” to carry out the penalty of restriction of liberty, including the cases when there are other offenses, which also clearly show that the punishment objectives designed to influence a person to comply with the law cannot be fully achieved if a person is offhandedly looking at the nature of the punishment. It would be useful to establish in the Criminal Code the obligation to participate in the social rehabilitation programs as determined at the discretion of the court, to expand the variety of the existing programs (social - rehabilitation work), such as: emotions and anger management, aggressive behavior, etc. programs for persons convicted of violent crimes in order to prevent the recurrence of crimes. The mere supervision does not help to implement the goals of punishment, there has to be a direct work with convicted persons in order to ensure safe environment for the society in which the sentenced person lives both during the execution time of the sentence and after it...|$|R
