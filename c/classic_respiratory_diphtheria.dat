40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the epidemiologic, laboratory, and clinical features of <b>respiratory</b> <b>diphtheria</b> cases reported in the United States during 1980 through 1995. METHODS: <b>Respiratory</b> <b>diphtheria</b> cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were reviewed. Cases were defined as physician-diagnosed cases with signs and symptoms compatible with <b>respiratory</b> <b>diphtheria,</b> including the presence of a pseudomembrane without other apparent cause. RESULTS: From 1980 through 1994, 41 <b>respiratory</b> <b>diphtheria</b> cases were reported; none were reported in 1995, and no secondary cases were identified. Nine (22 %) case patients were 4 years of age or younger, and 28 (68 %) were 15 years of age or older. None of the case patients were up to date with diphtheria vaccination; 4 unvaccinated children died. Seventeen (43 %) of 40 case patients had positive culture results. CONCLUSIONS: Available surveillance data suggest that <b>respiratory</b> <b>diphtheria</b> has become a rare disease in the United States. However, importation and circulation of toxigenic strains continue to present a threat and require achieving and maintaining high coverage with diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccines in both children and adults...|$|R
40|$|Diphtheria is an {{uncommon}} {{disease in the}} United States. It is caused by infection with toxigenic strains of gram-positive Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Important sites of infection are the <b>respiratory</b> mucosa (<b>respiratory</b> <b>diphtheria)</b> and the skin (cutaneous diphtheria). Rarely, extra-respiratory mucosal sites, e. g., the eye, ear, or genitals, may be affected. Humans are the only known reservoir of C. diphtheriae. The disease is transmitted {{from person to person}} by respiratory droplets or direct contact with respiratory secretions, discharges from skin lesions or, rarely, fomites. The onset of <b>respiratory</b> <b>diphtheria</b> is insidious and begins after an incubation period of 2 – 5 days. Initial symptoms of illness include a sore throat, difficulty in swallowing, malaise, and low-grade fever. The hallmark of <b>respiratory</b> <b>diphtheria</b> is the presence of an exudate that organizes into a tough, grayish-white pseudomembrane over the tonsils, the pharynx, or larynx. The pseudomembrane is strongly adherent to the underlying tissue, and attempts to dislodge it usually result in bleeding. Accompanying inflammation of the cervical lymph nodes and surrounding soft-tissue swelling of the neck give rise to a “bull-neck ” appearance and are a sign of moderate to severe disease. The membrane may progressively extend into the laryn...|$|R

This Pennsylvania resident had reportedly never been vaccinated against diphtheria. From October 3 - 10, this man and seven other men from New York, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia had worked in a rural village in Haiti. On return to Pennsylvania, the man was admitted to a hospital because of his severe sore throat and <b>respiratory</b> distress. <b>Respiratory</b> <b>diphtheria</b> was suspected when, during a tracheostomy procedure, a pseudomembrane was seen throughout his upper airways consistent with <b>respiratory</b> <b>diphtheria.</b> Several days later, {{a sample of the}} pseudomembrane was PC R positive for Corynebacterium diphtheriae tox genes. Based on his history of travel to Haiti where diphtheria is endemic, his clinical symptoms, and the positive PC R results, this patient has a confirmed case of <b>respiratory</b> <b>diphtheria.</b> Primary diphtheria immunization with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) is recommended for all persons aged 6 weeks to 6 years of age. The five DTaP doses are administered at ages 2, 4, and 6 months, at 15 - 18 months and at 4 - 6 years. Adolescents and adults should receive the adult formulation of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) every 10 years.

Diphtheria is a WHO-notifiable disease and alerts both clinicians and public health authorities. Infections caused by toxigenic Corynebacterium diphtheriae are now extremely rare in industrialised countries and are mostly associated with travel or contact with a person from an endemic area such as India, Indonesia, Brazil or the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union. 1 <b>Respiratory</b> <b>diphtheria</b> is usually transmitted by droplets, whereas cuta-neous diphtheria often results from minor trauma and frequently shows co-infection with other bacteria such as staphylococci and streptococci.

40|$|Corynebacterium diphtheriae is {{commonly}} isolated from cutaneous skin lesions in the Northern Territory of Australia. We prospectively assessed 32 recent isolates from infected skin lesions, {{in addition to}} reviewing 192 isolates collected over 5 years for toxin status. No isolates carried the toxin gene. Toxigenic C. diphtheriae is now a rare occurrence in the Northern Territory.

40|$|In 2015, {{a cluster}} of <b>respiratory</b> <b>diphtheria</b> cases was {{reported}} from KwaZulu-Natal Province in South Africa. By using whole-genome analysis, we characterized 21 Corynebacterium diphtheriae isolates collected from 20 patients and contacts during the outbreak (1 patient was infected with 2 variants of C. 20 diphtheriae). In addition, we included 1 cutaneous isolate, 2 endocarditis isolates, and 2 archived clinical isolates (ca. 1980) for comparison. Two novel lineages were identified, namely, toxigenic sequence type (ST) ST- 378 (n = 17) and nontoxigenic ST- 395 (n = 3). One archived isolate and the cutaneous isolate were ST- 395, suggesting ongoing circulation of this lineage for > 30 years.

40|$|This {{review of}} the {{mechanical}} properties of the respiratory system is related to ventilator practice. As virtually all modern ventilators display traces of airway pressure (Paw), volume (V) and ¯ow (VÇ) the necessary information is immediately available with no additional effort. This review interprets {{the information contained in}} ventilator wave-forms. The review concentrates on three aspects where measurements are most useful, namely: (i) the diagnosis and management of patients with injured lungs; (iii) patients with airways obstruction; and (iii) the assessment of respiratory motor output. We will outline the precision and accuracy of the derived variables, discuss their scienti®c basis and review how decisions based on these measure-ments improve patient outcomes. We give a personal perspective even if it means taking sides in debates on controversial issues. Basic principles (For a full discussion of <b>classic</b> <b>respiratory</b> system mech-anics the reader is referred to refs 6 and 47). <b>Classic</b> <b>respiratory</b> mechanics is based on Newtonian physics as expressed in the equation of motion. The respiratory system {{is considered to be a}} resistive and elastic element in series. Any pressure applied to it is either stored as elastic pressure (Pel) or dissipated as resistive pressure (Pres) P(t) =Pel(t) +Pres(t) (1) where t indicates a particular time. In its simplest interpretation the elastic element repre-sents lungs and chest wall, while the resistive element represents ventilator tubing, tracheal tube and airways (we will discuss the pitfalls and limitations of this simplistic model in the context of the speci®c applications).

40|$|Prior to the {{completion}} of this and other studies, low effectiveness of diphtheria toxoid± containing vaccine was suspected {{to be a major}} contributing factor to the diphtheria epidemic that began in the Russian Federation in 1990. A vaccine effectiveness study was done in Moscow by enrolling physician-diagnosed cases and 10 control subjects per case. Controls were matched to cases by age (53 months) and clinic registration. Vaccination history was abstracted from a standardized form for case-patients and from clinic vaccination records for control subjects. Two hundred seventeen case-patients and 2169 matched controls were in-cluded in the study. Most controls (92 %) had received three or more doses of a diphtheria toxoid vaccine, compared with 72 % of case-patients. The vaccine effectiveness for three or more doses was 97 % (95 % con®dence interval: 94. 3 ± 98. 4). Low vaccine effectiveness was not a contributing factor to the diphtheria epidemic in the Russian Federation. To control and prevent diphtheria epidemics, it is necessary to achieve and maintain high vaccination coverage with three or more doses of diphtheria toxoid among adults and children.

40|$|AbstractThe {{sea urchin}} egg is a {{quiescent}} cell…until fertilization, when the egg is activated.

Here we quantitate the kinetics of hydrogen peroxide synthesis at a single-cell level using an imaging photon detector, showing that 60 nM hydrogen peroxide accumulates within the perivitelline space of each zygote. We find that the NADPH oxidation activity is enriched at the cell surface and is sensitive to a pharmacological inhibitor of NADPH oxidase enzymes. Finally, we show that a sea urchin dual oxidase homolog, Udx 1, is responsible for generating the hydrogen peroxide necessary for the physical block to polyspermy. Phylogenetic analysis of the enzymatic modules in Udx 1 suggests a potentially conserved role for the dual oxidase family in hydrogen peroxide production and regulation during fertilization...|$|R

However, until now, there have not been any studies concerning about analytical respiratory mechanics. In this paper, the author has obtained two types of motion equations (linear and nonlinear) for the airflow limitation from formulation of the analytical respiratory me chanics. Reconstructed flow-volume trajectories of the linear equation revealed a new relationship among the slope of the linear portion of trajectory, the coefficient of the dissipation function and the coefficient of the potential function. Reconstructed trajectories of the nonlinear equation suggested that a curved flow-volume trajectory would be caused by the emergence of regional hypoventilated clusters with airtrapped lobules. In conclusion, analytical respiratory mechanics will provide the basis for analyzing the mechanical properties of the respiratory system con cerning pulmonary functional images made by newly developed technologies. </span...|$|R
40|$|The {{metabolism}} of sulfide, sulfur, and acetate by Beggiatoa alba {{was investigated}} under oxic and anoxic conditions. B. alba oxidized acetate to carbon dioxide with the stoichiometric reduction of oxygen to water.

B. alba also carried out an oxygen-dependent conversion of sulfide to sulfur, a reaction that was inhibited by several electron transport inhibitors {{but not by}} dibromothymoquinone, indicating that the electrons released from sulfide oxidation were shuttled to oxygen without the involvement of ubiquinones. Intracellular sulfur stored by B. alba was not oxidized to sulfate or converted to an external soluble form under aerobic conditions. On the other hand, sulfur stored by filaments of Thiothrix nivea was oxidized to extracellular soluble oxidation products, including sulfate. Sulfur stored by filaments of B. alba, however, was reduced to sulfide under short-term anoxic conditions.

40|$|The {{epidemic}} of diphtheria in the Newly Independent States (NIS) {{of the former}} Soviet Union has drawn attention to our incomplete understanding of the epidemiology of diph-theria. Many unanswered questions remain concerning the reasons for a resurgence of diph-theria and for the shift {{in the age of}} patients and concerning the mechanisms for acquisition of immunity in adults through natural infection under unfavorable living conditions. Other unanswered questions relate to the precise role of socioeconomic factors and hygiene con-ditions in the initiation, buildup, and spread of the epidemic. Important characteristics of the NIS epidemic can be used to help predict the spread of future diphtheria epidemics. These characteristics include a high proportion of infected adults, a progressive spread of disease from urban centers to rural areas, and transition from initial ampli®cation of disease in groups with high rates of close contacts in focalized, well-distinguished outbreaks to a more gener-alized epidemic. At the beginning of the 1980 s, many countries in the world were progressing toward the elimination of diphtheria. Diph-theria incidence rates reached their lowest levels, and there was optimism that elimination of indigenous <b>respiratory</b> <b>diphtheria</b> could be achieved in the European Region by 1990 by main-taining and strengthening immunization services [1]. However, a striking resurgence of epidemic diphtheria in the Newly Independent States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union has drawn attention to our lack of a full understanding of the epidemiology of the disease. The epidemic began in the Russian Federation {{at the end of the}} 1980 s and had affected all 15 NIS countries by the end of 1994 [2 ± 4]. Since 1992, some of the diphtheria cases reported from other parts of Europe have been linked to transmission from the NIS epidemic: in Belgium (3 / 3 cases), in England and Wales (1 / 19 cases), in Finland (10 / 10 cases), in Germany (8 / 23 cases), and in Greece (1 / 3 cases) [5].

40|$|The optimal light {{intensity}} required for photosynthesis by mesophyll protoplasts of pea (Pisum sativum) is about 1250 microeinsteins per square meter per second. On exposure to supra-optimal {{light intensity}} (2500 microeinsteins per square meter per second) for 10 min, the protoplasts lost 30 to 40 % of their photosynthetic capacity. Illumination with normal light intensity (1250 microeinsteins per square meter per second) for 10 min enhanced {{the rate of}} dark respiration in protoplasts. On the other hand, when protoplasts were exposed to photoinhibitory light, their dark respiration also was markedly reduced along with photosynthesis. The extent of photoinhibition was increased when protoplasts were incubated with even low concentrations of <b>classic</b> <b>respiratory</b> inhibitors: 1 micromolar antimycin A, 1 micromolar sodium azide, and 1 microgram per milliliter oligomycin. At these concentrations, the test inhibitors had very little or no effect directly {{on the process of}} photosynthetic oxygen evolution. The promotion of photoinhibition by inhibitors of oxidative electron transport (antimycin A, sodium azide) and phosphorylation (oligomycin) was much more pronounced than that by inhibitors of glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle (sodium fluoride and sodium malonate, respectively). We suggest that the oxidative electron transport and phosphorylation in mitochondria {{play an important role in}} protecting the protoplasts against photoinhibition of photosynthesis.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the development of}} a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme for Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the causative agent of the potentially fatal upper <b>respiratory</b> disease <b>diphtheria.</b> Global changes in diphtheria epidemiology are highlighted by the recent epidemic in the former Soviet Union (FSU) and also by the emergence of nontoxigenic strains causing atypical disease. Although numerous techniques have been developed to characterize C. diphtheriae, their use is hindered by limited portability and, in some instances, poor reproducibility. One hundred fifty isolates from 18 countries and encompassing a period of 50 years were analyzed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Strain discrimination was in accordance with previous ribotyping data, and clonal complexes associated with disease outbreaks were clearly identified by MLST. The data produced are portable, reproducible, and unambiguous. The MLST scheme described provides a valuable tool for monitoring and characterizing endemic and epidemic C. diphtheriae strains. Furthermore, multilocus sequence analysis of the nucleotide data reveals two distinct lineages within the population of C. diphtheriae examined, one of which is composed exclusively of biotype belfanti isolates and the other of multiple biotypes. ...|$|R
40|$|Mitochondria {{isolated}} from 3 -mm long maize (Zea mays L. var Dea) root tips {{were found to}} be heterogeneous on Percoll density gradients. The ultrastructure of these isolated mitochondria correlated well with that of mitochondria observed in situ and was consistent with the existence of mitochondria at different stages of maturation during cell development. The mitochondria of higher density presented an ultrastructure with many cristae and a dense matrix. These mitochondria showed <b>classic</b> <b>respiratory</b> properties, although with low ADP/O ratios. In contrast, the mitochondria of lower density showed few cristae and a clear matrix and {{did not seem to be}} fully functional because their rate of respiration was low and showed weak respiratory control. Lower- and higher- density mitochondria were shown to be differentially affected during the first stages of glucose starvation. The higher-density mitochondria from glucose-starved maize root tips retained the ultrastructure and most of the respiratory properties of nonstarved mitochondria, whereas lower- and intermediate-density mitochondria were absent in the mitochondrial preparations from glucose-starved maize root tips and were not observed in situ. Quantitatively, there was a decrease of the total mitochondrial pool when expressed as the amount of mitochondrial protein per root tip. However, this decrease affected low- and intermediate-density mitochondria, but not higher-density mitochondria. Thus, it was shown that a significant pool of functional mitochondria is maintained in maize root tips during the first stages of glucose starvation. The reasons for these apparently selective effects of glucose starvation on mitochondria are discussed in relation to effects on mitotic and differentiation processes...|$|R

This study included 12 children with cystic fibrosis, with ages between 8 - 13 years.

40|$|Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the causative {{agent of}} the severe <b>respiratory</b> disease <b>diphtheria,</b> {{utilizes}} hemin and hemoglobin as iron sources for growth in iron-depleted environments. Because of the toxicity of high levels of hemin and iron, these compounds are often tightly regulated in bacterial systems. In this report, we identify and characterize the C. diphtheriae hrtAB genes, which encode a putative ABC type transporter involved in conferring resistance to the toxic effects of hemin. Deletion of the hrtAB genes in C. diphtheriae produced increased sensitivity to hemin, which was complemented by a plasmid harboring the cloned hrtAB locus. The HrtAB system {{was not involved in}} the uptake and use of hemin as an iron source. The hrtAB genes are located on the C. diphtheriae genome upstream from the chrSA operon, which encodes a previously characterized two-component signal transduction system that regulates gene expression in a heme-dependent manner. The hrtB promoter is activated by the ChrAS system in the presence of hemin or hemoglobin, and mutations in the chrSA genes abolish heme-activated expression from the hrtB promoter. It was also observed that transcription from the hrtB promoter is reduced in a dtxR deletion mutant, suggesting that DtxR is required for optimal expression of hrtAB. Previous studies proposed that the ChrS sensor kinase may be responsive to an environmental signal, such as hemin. We show that specific point mutations in the ChrS N-terminal transmembrane domain result in a reduced ability to activate the hrtB promoter {{in the presence of a}} heme source, suggesting that this putative sensor region is essential for the detection of a signal produced in response to hemin exposure. This study shows that the HrtAB system is required for protection from hemin toxicity and that expression of the hrtAB genes is regulated by the ChrAS two-component system. This study demonstrates a direct correlation between the detection of heme or a heme-associated signal by the N-terminal sensor domain of ChrS and the transcriptional activation of the hrtAB genes...|$|R
