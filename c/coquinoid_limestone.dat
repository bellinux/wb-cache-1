40|$|The fossil crab Propinnotheroides orangeburgensis is {{described}} from the Eocene Santee Limestone in Orangeburg County, South Carolina. The specimens, two nearly complete carapaces preserved in lithifi ed coquina, add signifi cant detail {{to our knowledge}} of the Eocene decapod faunas inhabiting the off-shore bryozoan bioherms on the southeastern coast of North America. The <b>coquinoid</b> <b>limestone</b> facies of the Santee Limestone and Ocala and Castle Hayne Limestone represent shallow offshore bioherms and patch reefs deposited on the upper shelf of the ancient continental shelf. The bryozoan bioherms and patch reefs provided a nutrient-rich environment in which fostered the development of a distinctive Eocene reef fauna, including a diverse decapod fauna...|$|E
40|$|A section {{through the}} Upper Cambrian black shales and limestones at Kakeled on Kinnekulle, Västergötland, Sweden, {{extends from the}} lower–middle part of the Agnostus pisiformis Zone into the Peltura scarabaeoides Zone. Fossils are usually {{preserved}} only in the stinkstones, but in the A. pisiformis Zone trilobites can be found also in the shales. Lithologically, the stinkstones can be subdivided into primary <b>coquinoid</b> <b>limestone,</b> which include {{the majority of the}} fos− sils, and early diagenetically formed limestone. The orientation of cephala and pygidia of A. pisiformis were measured on four shale surfaces and one stinkstone surface. The majority of the shields were deposited with the convex side up and showed a preferred orientation, suggesting that their positions were affected by currents. Above the A. pisiformis Zone the section comprises the Olenus/Homagnostus obesus Zone (0. 30 m), {{the upper part of the}} Parabolina spinulosa Zone (0. 05 m), the Peltura minor Zone (1. 15 m), and the Peltura scarabaeoides Zone (2. 50 m). The Leptoplastus and Protopeltura praecursor zones are missing. The Olenus/H. obesus Zone is represented only by the O. gibbosus and O. wahlenbergi subzones, whereas the O. truncatus, O. attenuatus, O. dentatus, and O. scanicus subzones are missing...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} and chemical composition of oil occurring within the Ordovician limestone mounds of the Siljan district is discussed. The oil {{is concentrated in}} the core fades Stromatactis and <b>coquinoid</b> <b>limestones</b> of the larger, least tectonically disturbed, mounds. Analysis has shown the oil to be an immature crude, of hybrid paraffinic-naphthenic type...|$|R
50|$|The {{bedrock of}} City Island {{is part of}} the Anastasia Formation of {{interbedded}} sands and <b>coquinoid</b> <b>limestones</b> (known as Coquina), created during the late Pleistocene Epoch. On top of the bedrock are layers of river sediments, built up and deposited by the Halifax River. Channel dredgings in the last 100 years were also deposited on City Island.|$|R
40|$|Early Middle Cambrian {{bituminous}} <b>coquinoid</b> <b>limestones</b> from a tectonically isolated outcrop {{in southwestern}} Kyrgyzstan yield a remarkably diverse fauna, with stem-group cnidarians, trilobites, rhynchonelliformean brachiopods, and other shelly fossils. The fossil site {{is in the}} northern foothills of the Turkestan Range and thus forms part of the westernmost extension of the South Tien Shan. The fauna includes two fairly well known trilobite species, Glabrella ventrosa Lermontova, 1940 and Dorypyge richthofeniformis Lermontova, 1940, that provide confident support for an Amgan age of the rocks. New described taxa include the stem-group cnidarian Cambroctoconus kyrgyzstanicus Peel sp. nov., the trilobite Olenoides sagittatus Geyer sp. nov., and the helcionelloid Manasoconus bifrons Peel gen. et sp. nov. Additional fossils within the samples include the trilobites Olenoides sp. A, Kootenia sp., and Pseudoeteraspis? sp.; the rhynchonelliform brachiopods Narynella cf. ferganensis (Andreeva, 1962), Narynella? sp., Austrohedra? sp. nov., and two species of uncertain generic affinity; the tommotiid Tesella sp.; the hyolithelminth Hyolithellus sp.; and the palaeoscolecid Hadimopanella oezgueli Gedik, 1977. Of particular interest is Cambroctoconus kyrgyzstanicus with an octagonal corallum and a sparsely septate calyx...|$|R
40|$|The Servino Formation, {{representing}} the Lower Triassic in the Lombardy Southern Alps, records a major tectono-eustatic transgression that flooded the Permian alluvial plains {{at the onset}} of the Triassic. The stratigraphy of the Servino Formation in central and eastern Lombardy is here revised taking into account both recently published and newly-measured stratigraphic sections. Recognition of roughly isochronous petrologic intervals, which can be traced in all considered sections, and improved biostratigraphic control thanks to a recently acquired paleontologic datum, allowed us to subdivide the Servino Formation with greater detail than possible so far and to introduce two new members formally. The new stratigraphic scheme comprises six superposed members, from hottom to top: 1) conglomerates and sandstones deposited in fan delta settings (Prato Solaro Member), locally transgressed by hyhrid oolitic arenites (Praso Limestone); 2) quartzose sandstones with abundant interstitial dolomite (Ca’ San Marco Member, firstly introduced herein); 3) oolitic <b>coquinoid</b> <b>limestones</b> yielding iron ores and passing laterally to red calcarenites and mudrocks (“Gastropod Oolite”); 4) arkosic sandstones, displaying pebbly lags in the Lake Como area (Acquaseria Member, firstly introduced herein); 5) carbonates and marls, at places coquinoid and yielding iron ores (“Myophoria Beds”); 6) variegated siltstones and marls (“Upper Member”). This scheme is useful for detailed mapping of the Servino Formation and represents a significant step towards correlation with the long established members of the Werfen Formation. In particular, correlation between the Ca’ San Marco and Siusi Members is documented by analogous Claraia assemblages in both Lombardy and the Dolomites. Thickness of Lower Triassic sediments from the Dolomites to Lombardy appears to decrease abruptly across the Giudicarie Line, rather than gradually, probably due to an inherited Permian paleotopograph...|$|R
