40|$|The International Union of Operating Engineers (IUOE) {{has been}} {{involved}} with work at Department of Energy (DOE) sites since the Manhattan Project. A 1995 EPA/NIEHS Labor Market Study showed Operating Engineers to be the main labor force on environmental clean-up jobs throughout the country. Therefore, the IUOE with its intensive hands-on clean-up work force is often impacted by risk decisions such as clean-up vs. leave in place. This has resulted in a vested interest in understanding risk to the workers and their families. A cooperative agreement with the Department of Energy in 1995 has allowed the IUOE to work with the DOE to conduct safety and health assessments of new environmental technologies and has produced several products that are providing far-reaching impact for protecting workers dur ing current clean-up activities and for the future, after workers retire and enjoy the long-term stewardship of their lives. Several of the current initiatives such as the Technology Safety Data Sheet (TSDS) and the consideration of the costs of complying with safety and health regulations are discussed here.

It is the function of this paper to explore some possible approaches to the problem of satisfying these needs. [...] approaches, many of which will be developed in greater detail in later papers at this conference. Our objective here will be to consider briefly the importance of a librarian's knowledge of the economic, civic, and social patterns which make up the fabric of community life, then the selection of materials which will give the library the informational resources to meet the particular needs of the community. In this development of the library's collection, the role of intelligent, interested citizens can be an important one. Our staff resources must next engage our attention, as we consider the qualifications of the reference librarian and the planning of staff time which will best utilize the special skills of professionally-trained personnel. Since none of our libraries can encompass all of the recorded information which our users may need, we must give <b>continuing</b> <b>consideration</b> to the means of interlibrary organization that will achieve prompt transmission of information between libraries.

40|$|The {{author is}} <b>continuing</b> <b>consideration</b> on {{marketing}} information system in an exporting enterpise. Proposal of organizing {{marketing information system}} presented in the article takes into account practical differences between spheres of production and turn-over in the Polish foreign trade system. Furthermore, the majority of national exporting enterprises in organized as a conglomeration of branch institutions possessing independence to a certain degree. The proposed concept of system organization avails itself of principles of centralization as we) ll as de-centralization informative activity. It means that the whole of actions {{in the sphere of}} marketing information, indispensable fol creation and proper realization of a certain concept of exporting enterprise management, should be concentrated in a proper functional service. In this way, the system's activity is based on central (forced) flow of marketing information what eliminates it's casualty. Other information activities (collecting, initial processing, as well as information transmission) are de-concentrated. They belong to competence of particular enterprise units. Such solution is fully concordant with the modern management model, in which only strategic decisions are centralized while decisions in operative actions are decentralized. The principle of marketing information system functioning presented in the article are of a model character. The detailed system's organization and functioning is then dependent on: real information needs of an exporting enterprise, existing organization, workers qualifications etc. The model approach should then facilitate for organization of marketing information system as well as for elaboration of principles of it's functioning adequate for a given enterprise.

40|$|The {{nineteenth century}} {{witnessed}} a continuous growth {{in both the}} number of lunatic asylums, and {{in the numbers of}} people held within them. For many, contemporaries, and more recent commentators alike, the period was marked by the growing failure of the asylum as a curative institution. The reasons cited for this failure have varied, and at different times attention has focussed on a number of key themes. The purpose of this thesis is to critically examine each of these themes and to assess the expectations of those who built the asylum, those who worked in it, those who lived near it, and perhaps most importantly of all, those who used it. As such, the six chapters examine the asylum management and their motivations; the social separation of the insane patient, and how this was affected by external factors; the asylum's relationship with the various Poor Law authorities; the motivations that the families of the insane had for committing, and not committing their kin; the treatment regimes within the asylums, and how they differed between the sexes; and the central role that the asylum attendants had in caring for the insane. In each of these areas, perceptions of the asylums' supposed failure will be called into question, {{and there will be a}} <b>continuing</b> <b>consideration</b> of its function as both a custodial and a curative institution. Recent studies of extra-institutional care have emphasised that treatment in the asylum remained just one option in the `mixed economy of care'. Building on this, this thesis contests that the continued growth and development of the asylum system could not rest on its custodial function alone. Conversely, it shows that its ability to `cure' significant numbers of people continued to be a significant factor throughout the period...|$|E

30|$|Moreover, {{the present}} {{research}} also addresses two limitations of prior research. Firstly, although previously {{there has been a}} lack of research concerning the factors that influence contextual listening choices (Kamalzadeh et al., [2012]), the arousing and aesthetic dimensions and consideration of injunctive norms begin to define the salient factors in contextualized music choices. Secondly, there remains little theoretical understanding of everyday music listening. To that end, the present results support recent findings suggesting that control is an important element of contextualized listening (e.g., Krause et al., [2013], [2014]). Further, given the evidence that listeners appear to adopt arousal-optimization strategies (rather than arousal-moderation strategies as predicted by research on experimental aesthetics), Mehrabian and Russell’s PAD dimensions seem to offer a viable theoretical model. Though additional research is needed to fully define dominance in terms of everyday music listening, the present results support the <b>continued</b> <b>consideration</b> of the PAD model.|$|R
40|$|Housing First' {{programmes}} in the US {{involve the}} provision of mainstream scatter sited permanent housing at the initial stage of support for homeless individuals with multiple needs.

Evaluations of Housing First indicate, however, that even those considered farthest from being housed can, with help, successfully maintain a mainstream tenancy of their own. It is asserted here that one locally based agency managing both the housing and assertively providing holistic non time-limited support packages may be important factors in the success rate of Housing First programmes. However, a caveat is added-to robustly assess the effectiveness of Housing First (and homelessness policy per se) requires <b>continued</b> <b>consideration</b> as to what 'success' refers to in the resettlement of formerly homeless people...|$|R
40|$|This Article interrogates the {{traditional}} role and effect of professionals and professionalism in America’s media and civic discourse landscape by revisiting “network news” history {{through the lens}} of Ivan Illich’s deschooling theory. The Author offers the professionalization of political discourse on broadcast television as evidence that institutions inevitably foster a discourse of dependence and perpetuation of existing hierarchies. The Author contends that media law reified this professionalization through early interpretations of the bona fide newscast and news interview exemptions to the equal time rule, which aided in fostering a “thin citizenship. ” According to the Author, such political news and discourse is essential to the maintenance of America’s self-governing democrary, but cautions that Illich’s belief that the Epimethean Man’s natural inquisitiveness will translate into a desire for and production of civic knowledge and political discourse is idealistic.
