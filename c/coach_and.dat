40|$|A qualitative, interpretive {{case study}} {{approach}} {{was developed to}} explore the role of <b>coaching</b> <b>and</b> mentoring in supporting the development of academic staff and organisational strategy {{during a period of}} organisational change.

40|$|The {{similarities}} and differences between life <b>coaching</b> <b>and</b> counselling are vigorously debated in the literature and amongst practitioners.

It reviews the distinctions between <b>coaching</b> <b>and</b> counselling presented in the literature and provides qualitative evidence to support, clarify and challenge current claims that the distinction is principally definitional. In so doing, it demonstrates substantive similarities between <b>coaching</b> <b>and</b> counselling and recommends collaboration rather than competition between the two disciplines...|$|R

40|$|In {{discussion}} recently, a {{group of}} <b>coaching</b> <b>and</b> mentoring students at Oxford Brookes University highlighted how studying <b>coaching</b> <b>and</b> mentoring, using rigorous methods to answer meaningful questions had developed their practice more than they could have ever anticipated. This issue of IJEBCM draws {{particular attention to the}} questions asked by those studying <b>coaching</b> <b>and</b> mentoring and illustrates the benefits to practice of undertaking meaningful and systematic research. The issue includes papers presented at the recent <b>Coaching</b> <b>and</b> Mentoring Research Conference, held at Oxford Brookes University on 7 th April 2006. Since research in the field of <b>coaching</b> <b>and</b> mentoring is relatively new, this annual conference was instigated specifically to provide an opportunity for postgraduate students from any institution to share their work with a much wider audience. The benefits to coaching practice of well-formed questions are articulated in the summary by P. Alex Linley of his keynote presentation at the conference. In this paper Linley, writing as an academic researcher, talks about the advantages of research for <b>coaching</b> <b>and</b> mentoring and the obstacles to research both for the academic and the practitioner.

40|$|In this dissertation, the {{researcher}} employed de Certeau 2 ̆ 7 s theoretical insights into cultural production {{in everyday life}} to examine how literacy <b>coaches</b> <b>and</b> teachers discursively negotiated issues of identity, power, <b>and</b> positioning during <b>coaching</b> interactions. The study also explored how literacy <b>coaches</b> <b>and</b> teachers enacted emotions within these discursive negotiations of identity, power, and positioning; and how physical, social, and ideological spaces were shaped by <b>and</b> reflected in <b>coaching</b> interactions. Data were generated during a yearlong qualitative study of literacy <b>coaches</b> <b>and</b> teachers interacting within a mid-size, suburban district in the U. S. Midwest. The researcher used a microethnographic approach to discourse analysis to closely examine brief, video-recorded interactions between <b>coaches</b> <b>and</b> teachers. Other data sources included semi-structured interviews, field observations, and artifact collection. Findings demonstrate how dominant Discourses of best practices, teacher development, collaboration, <b>and</b> <b>coaches</b> 2 ̆ 7 credibility were simultaneously reproduced, resisted, and appropriated within the <b>coaching</b> interactions. <b>Coaches</b> <b>and</b> teachers interacted within conditions of vulnerability as they attempted to maintain identities as 2 ̆ 2 good 2 ̆ 2 <b>coaches</b> <b>and</b> teachers and negotiated understandings of what professional learning means, what counts as relevant knowledge for instructional decision making, and who decides.
