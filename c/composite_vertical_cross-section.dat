40|$|The {{formative}} {{stages of}} {{the onset of the}} 1979 southwest monsoon was marked by a WNW-ESE oriented band of marine convection over the South Arabian Sea. This convection was first observed on June 10, 1979 using satellite cloud imagery. The marine convection appeared during a major acceleration of the upper troposphere easterly wind field. A <b>composite</b> <b>vertical</b> meridional <b>cross-section</b> of upper level winds for June 11, revealed the core of the Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ) at 115 mb, 9. 5 deg N. Time analysis of the upper level wind field over the Tropical Wind Observing Ship (TWOS) polygon show a lowering of both the pressure level of maximum wind and tropopause level with acceleration of the upper level easterlies. The tropopause was as much as 20 mb lower on the equatorial side of the TEJ. Streamline analysis of the maximum observed easterly winds over India did not reveal the horizontal position of the TEJ. Careful analysis of Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) data for June 11, 1979 showed relatively high values of ozone south of India. It was observed that the latitudinal position of the TEJ on June 11, at approximately 70 deg E coincided with the northern edge of relatively high ozone values. Using this as a reference, the TEJ core was identified as far as NE Bay of Bengal (the limits of the available TOMS data) ...|$|R

For the first time the full spectrum of singular vectors of the Eady model are considered. The importance and implications of the unshielding and modal unmasking mechanisms to the computed singular vectors are discussed. The computed singular vectors are used to analyse the vertical structure of the singular vector targeting function commonly used in observation targeting, in a <b>vertical</b> <b>cross-section.</b> Through comparison of this <b>vertical</b> <b>cross-section</b> to the dynamics of singular vectors, inferences about the scale and qualitative behaviour of the perturbations to which particular regions are 'sensitive' are made.

40|$|This is {{the fourth}} {{installment}} of the five-part saga on the Umbral Transfer-Matrix method, based on Gian-Carlo Rota's seminal notion of the umbra. In this article we describe the Maple packages USAP, USAW,andMAYLIS. USAP automatically constructs, for any specific r, an Umbral Scheme for enumerating, according to perimeter, the number of self-avoiding polygons with # 2 r horizontal edges per <b>vertical</b> <b>cross-section.</b> The much more complicated USAW does the analogous thing for self-avoiding walks. Such Umbral Schemes enable counting these classes of self-avoiding polygons and walks in polynomial time {{as opposed to the}} exponential time that is required by naive counting. Finally MAYLIS is targeted to the special case of enumerating classes of saps with at most two horizontal edges per <b>vertical</b> <b>cross-section</b> (equivalently column-convex polyominoes by perimeter), and related classes. In this computationally trivial case we can actually automatically solve the equations that were automatically generated by USAP. As an example, we give the first fully computer-generated proof of the celebrated Delest-Viennot result that the number of convex polyominoes with perimeter 2 n + 8 equals (2 n + 11) 4 n - 4 (2 n + 1) !/n! 2...|$|R

The longwise SSR contours on the <b>vertical</b> <b>cross-section</b> along longitude clearly show the poorly-constrained {{nature of the}} mainshock focal depth. The contours, moreover, lean to the west. Since the SSR distributions of the immediate aftershocks show the same feature, {{it may be that}} the scattering of hypocenters due to poorly-constrained focal depths produces the westward- and steeply dipping distribution of mainshock and aftershocks.|$|R
