30|$|Another {{impact of}} the {{projects}} raised by the host communities {{is that most of}} the sites (villages) of the boreholes were not provided with the pipeborne water that is channelled to the city, which causes a bit of grievance for the local communities.

40|$|Presently, {{at least}} 70 % {{of the total}} urban {{population}} in Zambia resides in peri-urban areas. Peri-urban settlements are characterized by high population growth, high poverty levels and inadequate access to water and sanitation which often result in increased prevalence of diseases. The situation is even made worse because of the position that many local authorities have taken regarding the implementation of infrastructure and service development in these settlements. Local authorities in developing countries have continuously focused on implementation of traditional and unsustainable technologies for service provision {{to meet the demand}} despite the technologies’ inability to serve the rapidly growing peri-urban areas. These technologies have high costs, lack proper operation and maintenance, and are not affordable to majority of peri-urban residents. Therefore, this study was set out to identify and evaluate the existing and possible low-cost technology options for sustainable water supply and sanitation in two selected peri-urban areas of Lusaka, Zambia, namely Kanyama and Chazanga. This was achieved through a household survey conducted in the selected communities. Questionnaires and focus group discussions were held in the respective areas to obtain baseline data on the current water supply and sanitation situation, the type of technologies used, challenges faced regarding water and sanitation technologies, and to get the communities perceptions and preferences of different technology options. Thereafter, a Multi-Criterion Analysis methodological approach was used to assess the selected technologies by the communities, taking into consideration of the economic, socio-cultural, technical, institutional and environmental aspects. Results from the study revealed that a few low-cost water supply and sanitation technologies are feasible for peri-urban areas. For Chazanga, <b>communal</b> <b>taps,</b> boreholes, protected wells, and rain water harvesting were found to be feasible for water supply. For sanitation, on-site sanitation services such as compost toilets, dry toilets, as well as Ventilated Improved Pits (VIP) and Pour-flush, Fossa Alterna and the Urine Diversion Dry Toilet (UDDT) are some of the low-cost technologies that can be implemented in the area. The VIP is suitable for households that rely on water from <b>communal</b> <b>taps</b> for their use. As majority of households in the area have taps on their plots, the Pour-flush can be an alternative. The Fossa Alterna and the Urine Diversion Dry Toilet (UDDT) have low initial cost and can accommodate different households. Additionally, the area has a lower household size and majority of the residents in the area landlords, which makes it easy to teach users how the toilet operates as well as its maintenance. For Kanyama, feasible and sustainable low-cost water supply facilities include boreholes and <b>communal</b> <b>taps.</b> Kanyama has limited plot sizes thereby causing the challenge of implementing infrastructure such as rainwater harvesting. Additionally, continuous increase in urban population in the area, coupled with the construction of unregulated households and sanitation facilities, renders protected wells not feasible to implement in Kanyama. In terms of sanitation, wet on-site sanitation facilities such as Ventilated Improved Pit (VIP) latrines are accepted by the community. The VIP does not require water for use and if properly constructed {{can be used as a}} bathroom. The Pour-flush toilet is also another alternative for provision of sanitation in the area. However, the latrine can be expensive to construct for majority of the residents. Dry sanitation such as the Urine Diversion Dry Toilet (UDDT) is not feasible for Kanyama. The UDDT requires continuous awareness on its use especially in rented households where tenants are constantly changing. The method of evaluating appropriate technology options for peri-urban areas and thereafter letting the users from the communities choose from the proposed technologies ensures a participatory approach. Results from Multi-Criterion Analysis (MCA) showed that stakeholders’ influence is essential for the selection of sustainable technology options. However, it is important that the implementation process of any technology in peri-urban areas consider different aspects including the local environmental, socio-cultural, economic, technical, and institutional conditions. Finally, the outcome of this study will not only provide baseline data for successful implementation of appropriate low-cost water supply and sanitation technology options in Chazanga and Kanyama, but also other peri-urban communities in Zambia...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This {{dissertation}} {{is focused}} on the (re) configuration of social relations around a <b>communal</b> <b>tap.</b> It looks at the different ways in which fetching water from a <b>communal</b> <b>tap</b> brings life within an impoverished community in Cape Town, South Africa. I examine how the people of Imizamo Yethu who are located in a constrained and heavily populated geographical space, where movement and sociality are limited, take advantage of the tap space to (re) build relations through various social interactions. Water, one of the elements basic to human needs, activates hope in the midst of suffering, while stabilising residents’ uncertainties. During a four month ethnographic study of life within this community, I participated in and observed the daily practice of fetching water, and the interactions around one of the community’s taps. Building on the idea of water as a total social fact, and also conviviality as theoretical frame, I argue that water is as much a giver of life as it is a catalyst for social living. Water provides an opportunity for residents to meet, exchange stories, and seek survival strategies, further strengthening communal bonds. Through water and the social relations that it (re) configures, residents activate dignity...|$|E
40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to examine the {{long-term}} impact of the introduction of communal piped water supply on pattern of water use and transmission of schistosomiasis haematobia in an endemic area of Kenya. In the study area, Mtsangatamu, a control program based on repeated selective mass-chemotherapy had been carried out for 6 years from 1987 to 1993. The pre-treatment overall prevalence and intensity of infection in 1987 were 59. 2 % and 10. 9 eggs/ 10 ml of urine (Muhoho et al., 1997). During the control program, the prevalence was kept at a low range of 20 to 40 % (Muhoho et al., 1994). At the end of the program, in 1994, gravity-fed water supply was provided to the village. Although the water facilities were damaged by flooding in 1998, new and further expanded gravity-fed water supply facilities consisting of 7 standpipes were introduced in 2000. The follow-up survey done in 1999 revealed reduced prevalence and intensity of infection, I. e. 23. 0 % and 1. 2 eggs/ 10 ml of urine (unpublished data). The present study was carried out in 2006, 6 years after the last mass-chemotherapy. Urine examination showed that the prevalence and intensity of infection had return to 52. 2 % and 7. 4 eggs/ 10 ml, nearly the same level as the pre-treatment level. The results of our study demonstrated that, over the long-term, the gravity-fed water supply facilities had little impact on the overall prevalence and intensity of infection in this village. However, analysis of the spatial pattern of infection, observation of human water contact at the river and a questionnaire on water use shed light on the possible impact of water supply on human water contact. The younger people (5 - 19 years old) with easy access to the standpipes showed a lower prevalence and intensity of infection, while the relationship was not clear in other age groups. The result of the questionnaire indicated that the long distance from household to standpipe was the major factor limiting the use of the <b>communal</b> <b>tap</b> water. Most of the villagers who used piped water as the main source of water lived within 800 m of the nearest standpipe, and villagers who used river water exclusively lived beyond that distance. Observation of water-related activities at the communal water facilities also indicated that the residents who lived near standpipes used the piped water more frequently. The frequency of total visits to river water sites did not differ between residents who lived near and far from the standpipe. However, water contact in the form of playing, the highest risk behavior, was observed exclusively among children who lived far (> 250 m) from standpipes, although the number of observations was small. The present study demonstrated that the water facilities had little effect on the dispersed population but might have a beneficial effect on some villagers given easy access to standpipes...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} safe water {{is defined by}} three principles: the {{health-related}} quality must be suitable, the supply/source must be accessible and the water must constantly be available in quantities sufficient for the intended use. If any one (or more) of these three elements is missing from a water services improvement programme, providing safe water is not successfully achieved. A study in a deep rural area in South Africa showed that providing small communities, using untreated river water as their only water source, with good quality water through a piped distribution system and accessible at <b>communal</b> <b>taps</b> did not fall within our parameters of safe water. The parameters for measuring the three principles were: absence of Escherichia coli in drinking water samples; accessibility by improving tap distances to within 200 m from each household; availability by assessing whether households have at least 25 L per person per day. Results show that although E. coli levels were reduced significantly, households were still consuming water with E. coli numbers at non-compliant levels. Access (distance) was improved {{from an average of}} 750 m from households to river source to an average of 120 m to new on-tap source points. This did not result in significant increases in household quantities, which on average remained around 18 L per person per day...|$|R
40|$|In Accra, Ghana, a {{majority}} of inhabitants lives in over-crowded areas with limited access to piped water supply, which is often also intermittent. This study assessed in a densely populated area the risk from microbial contamination of various sources of drinking water, by conducting a Quantitative Microbiological Risk Assessment (QMRA) to estimate the risk to human health from microorganism exposure and dose-response relationships. Furthermore the cost-effectiveness in reducing the disease burden through targeted interventions was evaluated. Five risk pathways for drinking water were identified through a survey (110 families), namely household storage, private yard <b>taps,</b> <b>communal</b> <b>taps,</b> <b>communal</b> wells and water sachets. Samples from each source were analyzed for Escherichia coli and Ascaris contamination. Published ratios between E. coli and other pathogenswere used for theQMRA and disease burden calculations. The {{major part of the}} burden of disease originated from E. coli O 157 :H 7 (78 %) and the least important contributor was Cryptosporidium (0. 01 %). Other pathogens contributed 16 % (Campylobacter), 5 % (Rotavirus) and 0. 3 % (Ascaris). The sum of the disease burden of these pathogens was 0. 5 DALYs per person per year, which is much higher than the WHO reference level. The major contamination pathway was found to be household storage. Disinfection of water at household level was the most cost-effective intervention (b 5 USD/DALY-averted) togetherwith hygiene education. Water supply network improvements were significantly less cost-effective...|$|R
40|$|Dissertation {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Master of Technology: Environmental Management in the Faculty of Applied Science at the Cape Peninsula University of TechnologyGreywater is domestic wastewater from daily kitchen, laundry, bath, shower, hand washing practices and does not include wastewater from the toilet. Greywater from informal settlement {{has been identified as}} important environmental pollution sources. Inadequate sanitation and poor drainage in informal settlements result in greywater being stagnant at the base of <b>communal</b> <b>taps.</b> This water has a potential to cause health problems to those who come in contact with it. Studies of greywater quality in informal settlements in South Africa tend to concentrate on physico-chemical analysis and microbial indicator organisms. In order to adequately manage greywater in informal settlements {{there is a need to}} understand the microbial pathogens present in such water. Therefore this study is aimed at determining the level of microbial contamination of stagnant greywater in the RR Section of Khayelitsha, Western Cape. Six sampling sites were identified and sampling of stagnant greywater was conducted twice a month (from January to May 2013) from the base of six <b>communal</b> <b>taps,</b> which served as the sampling sites. The microbial enumeration techniques employed in this study were the Most Probable Number (MPN) techniques, the Heterotrophic Plate Count (HPC) technique and the Flow Cytometric (FCM) technique. The API 20 E and the RapID™ ONE systems were used to identify possible pathogenic Gram-negative microorganisms, while possible pathogenic Gram-positive microorganisms were identified with the BBL Crystal™ Gram Positive (GP) Identification (ID) system. The highest MPN counts were 1. 6 x 108 microorganisms/ 100 mℓ recorded at Site A (weeks 3 and 5) as well as at Site B (week 5). The corresponding highest faecal coliform count was 4. 7 x 106 microorganisms/ 100 mℓ obtained at Site B (week 5). The highest E. coli count observed was 1. 8 x 106 microorganisms/ 100 mℓ recorded at Site A (week 5) and Site F (week 5). In comparison, the highest HPC count was 2. 9 x 105 microorganisms/mℓ recorded at Site C in week 4. The results obtained by the MPN and HPC techniques were significantly (p < 0. 05) higher than the water quality standards by Department of Water Affairs and Forestry (DWAF) (1996 a; 1996 b) and the SABS (2011). The highest total FCM and viable FCM counts were 3. 4 x 107 microorganisms/mℓ and 3. 1 x 107 microorganisms/mℓ, respectively recorded at Site A in week 5. The FCM technique displayed significantly (p < 0. 05) higher results than both the MPN and HPC techniques, which highlighted its reliability in obtaining more accurate enumeration results. The RapID™ ONE and the API 20 E identification systems mostly identified Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, K. oxytoca, Acinetobacter baumannii/calcoaceticus and Enterobacter cloacae, while the organisms more commonly identified by the BBL Crystal™ Gram Positive (GP) Identification (ID) system, were the Corynebacterium species, and Bacillus cereus. The presence of these organisms raises health concern to the community of RR Section, as some are known to cause waterborne diseases, while others are known to cause nosocomial infections...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{understand}} the problem of attaining safe and clean water that has contributed to high incidence of water borne diseases and to investigate its effects on the residents of Chawama Township, Lusaka, Zambia. A survey was used to collect data from 400 male and female participants to determine their source, treatment and storage of water; sanitary facilities; attitude, experience and knowledge of waterborne diseases. Findings indicated that, the most common source of water was <b>communal</b> city <b>taps</b> and residents did not boil or add chlorine to make it safe for use, making it susceptible for them to contract waterborne diseases. Pit latrines were the common type of toilet facility residents used. Almost all of the participants had a wide knowledge of waterborne diseases particularly cholera and diarrhea. An understanding of the link between unsafe water and waterborne diseases can be useful to the decision makers for planning, management and evaluation of water supply policies.

40|$|In the South African context, {{upgrading}} to, {{and delivery}} of a basic water-supply service to small-community households is expected to bring benefits such as reduced exposure to contaminated drinking water. A basic water-supply service mostly means that water is distributed to the community via <b>communal</b> <b>taps</b> that {{are not on the}} households’ premises (DWA, 2003). While this is seen as an improvement, people still have to use plastic containers (mostly 20 - 25 ℓ volume) to collect water from the taps and store in their houses (Nala et al., 2003). Authors report that, from a health-related microbial water quality perspective, the management (e. g. poor container-hygiene practices) of household containers cause microbial re-contamination of good quality water (Gundry et al., 2004; Jagals et al., 2004; Jensen et al., 2002). This implies that household container water pose a risk of microbial infection to an individual if used for drinking without any household level disinfection. Providing clean water to households, even thought they might still have to use the containers, does limit the extent of the recontamination because of consistent use with the clean water as opposed to when communities use these containers to source contaminated surface waters (Mokoena et al., 2010). When the supply system fails, which was reported to happen frequently in the study area (Rietveld et al., 2009), the affected communities will return to their original source of water, using the same containers to collect what is often contaminated water (Momba et al., 2006). While it is plausible that the probable risk of infection will change with these service inconsistencies, it has not conclusively been shown what the effect of it might be on risk. This submission demonstrates how a quantitative microbial risk assessment (WHO, 2004) {{can be used as a}} tool to assess these shifts in risk, offering another technique to assess the effectiveness of a small-community water supply service. The aim of the study was assess, after implementation with subsequent operation and maintenance of two small-community water supply schemes, the effect of service delivery on the annual risk of bacterial infection for individuals based on pathogenic E. coli in the water that the people in the community drink...|$|R
5000|$|As the United States industrialized {{during the}} 19th century, {{immigrants}} and {{workers from the}} countryside were housed in former middle-class houses and other buildings, such as warehouses, which were bought up and divided into small dwellings, and also, beginning {{as early as the}} 1830s in New York City's Lower East Side or possibly the 1820s on Mott Street, in jerry-built 3- and 4-floor [...] "railroad flats" [...] (so called because the rooms are linked together like a train) with windowless internal rooms.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. South Africa {{is still}} feeling {{the effects of}} the forced inequalities the {{apartheid}} system introduced and the resulting wide-spread poverty. Inequalities are particularly evident in the quality of services provided to different areas, which are in the majority still defined by race. The majority of White households have very good service provision, with water piped directly into the home. A great number of Black and Coloured households, by contrast, have very low levels of service where family members have to walk to collect water from <b>communal</b> <b>taps.</b> To this day, there are households in South Africa that {{do not have access to}} water infrastructure at all relying on rivers, streams or boreholes, with an increased risk of experiencing water borne diseases. With the end of apartheid and the beginning of democracy in 1994, the new government prioritised the redress of inequalities and sought to better the lives of the poor by providing them with improved services. This meant building or upgrading infrastructure as well as ongoing maintenance; whilst the initial costs were high, it became very quickly apparent that revenue needed to be collected in order to cover costs. Between 2008 and 2009, 26. 3 % of South Africans were living below the food poverty line of R 305 per person, and 52. 3 % were living below the upper bound poverty line, and this meant that many households were not able to afford the upgraded services. In recognising this challenge the Free Basic Water Policy (FBWP) was established in 2001, which provided a limited “lifeline” supply of water to every household for free, while any additional water usage would have to be paid for. When the FBWP was conceptualised, it was designed to meet certain implementation and supply quality goals and standards. However, over time criticism rose that these goals had not been achieved and that in some cases the policy proved counterproductive. The objective of this dissertation is to examine the implementation of FBWP thus far, and to assess whether or not it is achieving the originally intended goals and standards. Quantitative data was gathered and used to compare the progress of the implementation of the FBWP to the implementation goals in order to assess whether or not the goals are being met. Overall there were six major goals for the implementation of the FBWP, with specific targets and standards pertaining to each goal. For the purpose of this study, the data for each goal was analysed and discussed so that the progress in achieving each goal could be assessed. The findings show that significant progress and improvement has been made in supplying Free Basic Water (FBW]. Although access to water supply and FBW, the level of service provided and the quality of the water have improved, there are still households who are not receiving FBW at the required standards. From the rate of progress made it can be seen that the original intention of providing FBW for all by 2014 was over-optimistic. A second finding was that the FBWP is not financially sustainable at present and that there is currently a lack of asset management and maintenance planning in many municipalities in South Africa, which has resulted in substantial revenue losses. It was also found that the monitoring of the FBWP is currently not sufficient. Aspects such as appropriateness of the allocated amount can only be resolved with improved monitoring mechanisms. The effectiveness of education programmes on water usage requires assessment in order to understand how increased awareness can impact on households’ ability to safe water...|$|R
40|$|The study {{assessed}} {{the impact of}} the water supply intervention on the health-related microbiological water quality of source and stored water. The study area was a rural community with limited access to safe drinking water and sanitation systems for use. Previously, participating households had to collect water from remote sources (sub-villages near the river and irrigation canals), store water in various types of containers before use and under certain conditions in the domestic environment that may impact negatively on the water quality. These sub-villages were referred to as the Intervention group. The Reference group, were households from the same village (sub-villages away from the river) and for many years have collected and used water from <b>communal</b> <b>taps.</b> The water from the tap was pumped from a groundwater source of a better microbiological quality compared to the Intervention groups’ surface water. Communal standpipes that were installed several years ago were operationalised (water supply intervention) in the Intervention group {{at the time of the}} study and provided the opportunity to compare the various water sources and their impact on the health-related microbiological water quality of container-stored water. There were significant differences in the quality of various water sources used by the Intervention and Reference groups. The level of contamination was found to be higher in the Intervention group surface waters than in the Reference group tap water (groundwater source). Counts of total coliforms and E. coli were much higher in the Intervention group water sources than the Reference group, indicating that surface water was exposed to more pollution in the environment than the protected groundwater supplying taps. There were also significant differences in the water quality of source and container-stored waters used by both Intervention and Reference groups. The numbers of indicator organisms were significantly lower in the Intervention group container-stored river water than in the river source water, suggesting bacterial die-off in stored water. For the Reference group, higher counts of total coliforms and E. coli were found once tap water was sourced and stored in containers at home. The level of these indicators in the Reference group stored water supported the statement that water of good quality at the source often becomes contaminated during storage at home but in case of the Intervention group river water, the storage process brought about improvements in water quality. Container water quality of the Intervention group was assessed “before” and “after” the water supply intervention. A significant decrease was found in the indicator organism numbers (total coliforms and E. coli) “after” the intervention, showing a strong association between the use of an improved water supply and a good water quality. The results have also shown that the Reference group container-stored tap water had lower indicator organism numbers than the Intervention group container-stored river water before the intervention. After the Intervention group tap water was operationalised, its container-stored waters were compared to that of the Reference group (both groups now on tap water), and surprisingly there were significantly higher numbers of indicators in the Reference group stored water, suggesting poor domestic hygiene practices. No significant differences were expected because the same supply was used by both groups. Twenty eight households were randomly selected to assess the sustainability of the water supply intervention after one year of using tap water by the people of Folovhodwe, especially those from the Intervention group. There was a significant increase in the indicator organism numbers in container-stored water after one year of using tap water. Higher levels of indicator organisms (one year later) were probably associated with inadequate water handling practices at home, since the borehole groundwater after one year had zero indicator organisms (total coliforms and E. coli) indicating good water quality at the source. The health-related microbiological quality (at the source and in the containers) did not comply with the proposed safety limits in various water quality guidelines. A negative outcome in both groups was that E. coli was still higher than the WHO risk limit for water intended for drinking at the source and in storage containers suggesting continued faecal pollution of the water. Judging by the overall results, it is evident that the water supply intervention played a role in reducing the numbers of indicator organisms, although still above the guideline limits. It also appears that water supply interventions alone are not sufficient to improve and maintain water quality especially at the point of consumption; therefore hygiene practices around stored water at home need to be improved in order to achieve maximum health benefits.

40|$|Early life {{exposure}} to inorganic arsenic (iAs) {{has been shown}} to interfere with foetal and early childhood development, and is associated with morbidity and mortality in adulthood. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate {{exposure to}} As in utero, to determine the association between maternal and cord blood of As and birth outcomes in South African populations. Total arsenic was measured in maternal blood of a total cohort (n= 650) and in paired cord blood and urine of a subset cohort (n= 317). Overall, the geometric mean (GM) of As in maternal blood was 0. 62 μg/L (n= 650; 95 % CI, 0. 58 - 0. 66). In the subset cohort, the GM of maternal blood As was 0. 96 μg/L (n= 350; 95 % CI, 0. 91 - 1. 02); in paired cord blood, the GM was 0. 78 μg/L (n= 317; 95 % CI, 0. 74 - 0. 83); and in urine (creatinine-corrected), the GM was 14. 26 μg/g creatinine (n= 317; 95 % CI, 12. 64 - 16. 09). A linear correlation was found between log maternal blood As and log cord blood As (rho= 0. 80, p< 0. 001). Birth outcomes showed geographical differences. in gestational age (p< 0. 001), birth length (p= 0. 019), head circumference (p< 0. 001), Apgar score at 5 min (p< 0. 001) and parity (p< 0. 002). In a multivariate analysis, no association between maternal blood (AsB) levels and birth outcomes were found. However, the lower the gestational age, the higher the levels of maternal AsB (β=- 0. 054; 95 % CI- 0. 087 to - 0. 020) and mothers who had had at least one child were less likely to have higher AsB if compared to those who had never had any child (β=- 0. 177; 95 CI- 0. 322 to 0. 031). In both univariate and multivariate analyses, being single, and drinking water from <b>communal</b> outdoor <b>taps,</b> boreholes and rivers was associated with higher As levels. The findings suggest that more research is needed to evaluate the impact of low level As exposure on postnatal development.
