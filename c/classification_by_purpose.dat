30|$|Spitzner {{suggests}} the <b>classification</b> of honeypots <b>by</b> <b>purpose</b> [1]. There are research honeypots and production honeypots. The research honeypot {{is designed to}} gain information about the blackhat community {{and it does not}} add any direct value to the organization, which has to protect its information [7]. The main aim here is to get maximum information about the blackhats by giving them full access to penetrate the security system and infiltrate it [8]. A second type of purpose classified honeypot is the production honeypot, used within an organization’s environment to protect the organization and help mitigate risk [7]. An example of the production honeypot is a honeypot which captures, collects, and analyzes malware for anti-virus systems, intrusion detection system signatures, etc.|$|R
5000|$|Songs may {{be written}} {{for one or}} more singers to sing without {{instrumental}} accompaniment {{or they may be}} written for performance with instrumental accompaniment. The accompaniment used for a song depends on the genre of music and, in classical styles, the instructions of the composer as set out in the musical score. Songs may be accompanied by a single accompanist playing piano or guitar, by a small ensemble (e.g., a jazz quartet, a basso continuo group (in the case of Baroque music), a rock or pop band or a rhythm section) or even a big band (for a jazz song) or orchestra (for a classical aria). One division is between [...] "art songs", [...] "pop songs" [...] and traditional music which includes [...] "folk songs" [...] and early blues songs. Other common methods of <b>classification</b> are <b>by</b> <b>purpose</b> (sacred vs secular), by style (dance, ballad, Lied, etc.), or by time of origin (Renaissance, Contemporary, etc.). Songs may be learned and passed on [...] "by ear" [...] (as in traditional folk songs); from a recording or lead sheet (in jazz and pop) or from detailed music notation (in classical music). Some instrumental music which is played in a singing style may be named a song, e.g., Mendelssohn's Songs Without Words for solo piano.|$|R
40|$|In this correspondence, {{we propose}} design {{techniques}} for analysis and synthesis filters of 2 -D perfect reconstruction filter banks (PRFB's) that perform optimal reconstruction when a reduced number of subband signals is used. Based on the minimization of the squared error between the original signal and some low-resolution representation of it, the 2 -D filters are optimally {{adjusted to the}} statistics of the input images so {{that most of the}} signal's energy is concentrated in the first few subband components. This property makes the optimal PRFB's efficient for image compression and pattern representations at lower resolutions for <b>classification</b> <b>purposes.</b> <b>By</b> extending recently introduced ideas from frequency domain principal component analysis to two dimensions, we present results for general 2 -D discrete nonstationary and stationary second-order processes, showing that the optimal filters are nonseparable. Particular attention is paid to separable random fields, proving that only the first and last filters of the optimal PRFB are separable in this case. Simulation results that illustrate the theoretical achievements are presented...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a deep learning network for classification of different flowers. For this, we have used Visual Geometry Group's 102 category flower dataset having 8189 images of 102 different flowers from University of Oxford. The method is basically divided into two parts; Image segmentation and classification. We have compared the performance of two different Convolutional Neural Network architectures GoogLeNet and AlexNet for <b>classification</b> <b>purpose.</b> <b>By</b> keeping the hyper parameters same for both architectures, {{we have found that}} the top 1 and top 5 accuracies of GoogLeNet are 47. 15 % and 69. 17 % respectively whereas the top 1 and top 5 accuracies of AlexNet are 43. 39 % and 68. 68 % respectively. These results are extremely good when compared to random classification accuracy of 0. 98 %. This method for classification of flowers can be implemented in real time applications and can be used to help botanists for their research as well as camping enthusiasts. Comment: 4 page...|$|R

Among tumor characteristics we considered: histological type, TNM classification and stage, eventual loco-regional extra-axillary lymph node involvement (internal mammary chain and subclavear), nuclear grading, Mib 1 /Ki- 67 proliferation index, estrogen and progesteron receptors expression, Her 2 /neu status, and molecular subtypes. Moreover, we included other microscopical histological characteristics which are included in the more recent <b>classification</b> <b>purposed</b> <b>by</b> Veronesi and colleagues (Arnone et al. 2010) as previously described (Cedolini et al. 2014 a, b, c; Bertozzi et al. 2013; Bernardi et al. 2012 a, b), including multifocality/multicentricity, extensive intraductal component, perivascular invasion, peritumoral inflammation, lymph node extra-capsular invasion, and presence of bunched lymph nodes. Finally, we {{took into consideration}} also the therapeutic management: type of intervention on the breast (conservative breast surgery or mastectomy) and the axilla (sentinel lymph node biopsy or complete lymph node axillary dissection), eventual neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapies (chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, biological drugs, radiation therapy).|$|R

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the profit}} and loss account from the Romanian accounting regulations’ perspective in terms of format, structure, content, which is subject to the approval of OMPF no. 3055 / 2009 harmonized with the European accounting directives. Even if from the name it appears the compliance with the European accounting directives, the Romanian {{profit and loss}} account brings elements from the international standard IAS 1. Moreover, if we compare the structure of {{profit and loss account}} chosen by the Romanian policy makers with the structure proposed by the IV Directive, the list model, with the classification of operating expenses by nature, we conclude that they are similar, with small features found in the present order, an order which was also analyzed in the paper. We tried to explain and argue the preference of Romanian policy makers for the list model of profit and loss account, with the <b>classification</b> of expenses <b>by</b> nature, but also the necessity to present, in the explicative notes, the <b>classification</b> of expenses <b>by</b> <b>purpose,</b> which is actually a combination of regulations between the IV Directive and the IAS 1 standard. In {{the second part of the}} paper we considered interesting to analyze the content of certain elements related to the profit and loss account, namely: the extraordinary elements, the cost of sold goods and services of the Analysis of operating result to capture both Romanian specific features, as well as the elements of IAS 1 standard, the net turnover indicator, the items of gain and loss, the stocks variation element and the element Result on action...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Cyber {{attacks have}} greatly {{increased}} over the years, where the attackers have progressively improved in devising attacks towards a specific target. To aid in identifying and defending against cyber attacks we propose a cyber attack taxonomy called AVOIDIT (Attack Vector, Operational Impact, Defense, Information Impact, and Target). We use five major classifiers to characterize the nature of an attack, which are <b>classification</b> <b>by</b> attack vector, <b>classification</b> <b>by</b> attack target, <b>classification</b> <b>by</b> operational impact, <b>classification</b> <b>by</b> informational impact, and <b>classification</b> <b>by</b> defense. Our fifth category, <b>classification</b> <b>by</b> defense, is used to provide the network administrator with information of how to mitigate or remediate an attack. Contrary to the existing taxonomies, our taxonomy efficiently classifies blended attacks. Our taxonomy is applied using an application approach with pabulum to educate the defender on possible cyber attacks.

40|$|Background: Breast {{cancer is}} one of the most {{encountered}} cancers in women. Detection and classification of the cancer into malignant or benign {{is one of}} the challenging fields of the pathology. Objectives: Our aim was to classify the mammogram data into normal and abnormal <b>by</b> ensemble <b>classification</b> method. Patients and Methods: In this method, we first extract texture features from cancerous and normal breasts, using the Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCM) method. To obtain better results, we select a region of breast with high probability of cancer occurrence before feature extraction. After features extraction, we use the maximum difference method to select the features that have predominant difference between normal and abnormal data sets. Six selected features served as the classifying tool for <b>classification</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>by</b> the proposed ensemble supervised algorithm. For classification, the data were first classified by three supervised classifiers, and then by simple voting policy, we finalized the classification process. Results: After classification with the ensemble supervised algorithm, the performance of the proposed method was evaluated by perfect test method, which gave the sensitivity and specificity of 96. 66 % and 97. 50 %, respectively. Conclusions: In this study, we proposed a new computer aided diagnostic tool for the detection and classification of breast cancer. Th...|$|R
