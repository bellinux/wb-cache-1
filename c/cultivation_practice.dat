25|$|A {{major threat}} to forests of India are in its northeastern states. From ancient times, the locals have practiced slash-and-burn {{shifting}} cultivation to grow food. Locally called Jhum, it supports about 450,000 families in Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, Assam and Meghalaya. Approximately 15,000 square kilometers of forest land is under jhum cultivation, and just a sixth of this land is actually producing any crop at any given year. The tribal people consider it a tradition, and economic ecosystem. However, the slash and burn causes damage to a dense forest, to soil, to flora and fauna, as well as pollution. The crop yields are very poor with jhum cultivation. Between 2010 and 2012, satellite studies confirmed {{a net loss of}} forest cover over these northeastern states. The lost forest includes primary dense forests. There is a concerted effort by the state government officials to educate, incentivize and train jhum dependent families to horticulture and other high value crops, along with an offer of food supply security. Bamboo-based textiles and value added forest products industries are also being encouraged by the local officials. States such as Arunachal Pradesh reported reduction in Jhum <b>cultivation</b> <b>practice</b> in 2013.|$|E

50|$|Matengo Highlands (an {{evergreen}} montane forest) has {{a unique}} system of cultivation known as the “pit cultivation system” also called the “Ngara System” practiced by the local Matengo ethnic group in Mbinga district; other three {{ethnic groups in the}} district comprise the Ngoni, the Manda and Nyasa, with the Matengo constituting 60% of the population with a population density of 34 people/km², as of 2000. The pit <b>cultivation</b> <b>practice</b> is a unique farming system on the highlands' steep slopes referred to as ngolo. Under this system of cultivation, the local community has benefited with increased agricultural production. The system has also promoted environmental sustainability. Under this practice, tied ridges are created in the agricultural fields for in-situ composting, which also enables run off retention in the pits between the ridges. The pits are generally about a yard in diameter and a foot deep. Composting is created in the pits by mixing the loosened soil with cut grass, and then plant seeds in the light. These also help in stabilizing the soil in the hill slopes and mixing in grass and old plants enriches it. It is reported that the yield from this practice is generally better than the traditional flat land <b>cultivation</b> <b>practice,</b> and this trend continues over a long period. However, the limiting factors noted in this practice are non availability of labour force to work on the fields and inadequate supply of composting fertilizers. This practice developed since the 18th century has also been acclaimed as an effective soil conservation measure. This <b>cultivation</b> <b>practice</b> usually starts in March following the rainy season. However, specifically in the Matnego Highlands, where the Matengo population density was reported to be 120/km², there was pressure on land use which has resulted in people migrating from the highlands to the woodlands in the northeastern region for cultivation.|$|E

5000|$|In the {{cultural}} context of China, Falun Gong is generally described {{either as a}} system of qigong, or a type of [...] "cultivation practice" [...] (xiulian). Cultivation is a Chinese term that describes {{the process by which}} an individual seeks spiritual perfection, often through both physical and moral conditioning. Varieties of <b>cultivation</b> <b>practice</b> are found throughout Chinese history, spanning Buddhist, Daoist and Confucian traditions. Benjamin Penny, a professor of Chinese history at the Australian National University, writes [...] "the best way to describe Falun Gong is as a cultivation system.

5000|$|A further {{distinctive}} type of sects of {{the folk}} religion, that are possibly {{the same as}} the positive [...] "secret sects", are the martial sects.

They were outlawed by Ming imperial edicts that continued to be enforced until the fall of the Qing dynasty in the 20th century.

50|$|In {{addition}} to these things, practitioners of Falun Gong must abandon a variety of worldly attachments and desires. In the course of <b>cultivation</b> <b>practice,</b> the student of Falun Gong aims to relinquish the pursuit of fame, monetary gain, sentimentality, and other entanglements. Li's teachings repeatedly emphasize the emptiness of material pursuits; although practitioners of Falun Gong are not encouraged to leave their jobs or eschew money, {{they are expected to}} give up the psychological attachments to these things. Similarly, sexual desire and lust are treated as attachments to be discarded, but Falun Gong students are still generally expected to marry and have families. All sexual relations outside the confines of monogamous, heterosexual marriage are regarded as immoral. Although gays and lesbians may practice Falun Gong, homosexual conduct is said to generate karma, and is therefore viewed as incompatible with the goals of the practice.|$|E
