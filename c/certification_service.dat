[...] Many decided to adopt some Japanese industrial practices, including quality management, which was thought to have played a large part in the Japanese economic miracle. Beginning in the early 1980s, the quality standard BS 5750 (1979) became widely adopted by British companies. Yarsley Technical Centre already had a strong background in standards and accreditation and, in 1985, Fulmer established Yarsley Quality Assured Firms (YQAF) as an independent certification body, supported by the UK Department of Trade and Industry, which assessed conformity to BS 5750 and certified conforming companies. YQAF's <b>certification</b> <b>service</b> was overseen by an independent Certification Board under an independent chairman, thus ensuring {{that there was no}} conflict of interest with YQAF's consultancy services.|$|E
