5|$|The {{phonology}} {{of words}} {{has proven to}} be beneficial to vocabulary development when children begin school. Once children have developed a vocabulary, they utilize the sounds that they already know to learn new words. The phonological loop encodes, maintains and manipulates speech-based information that a person encounters. This information is then stored in the phonological memory, a part of short term memory. Research shows that children's capacities in the area of phonological memory are linked to vocabulary knowledge when <b>children</b> <b>first</b> begin school at age 4–5 years old. As memory capabilities tend to increase with age (between age 4 and adolescence), so does an individual's ability to learn more complex vocabulary.|$|E

25|$|With {{the move}} into San Francisco, the Temple more strenuously {{emphasized}} that its members live communally.

25|$|When <b>children</b> <b>first</b> {{learn how}} lying works, {{they lack the}} moral {{understanding}} of when to refrain from doing it. This takes years of watching people tell lies, {{and the results of}} these lies, to develop a proper understanding. Propensity to lie varies greatly between children, some doing so habitually and others being habitually honest. Habits in this regard are likely to change in early adulthood.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} few years, the band alternated album {{releases}} and touring (see Van Halen concert tours). Their Women and <b>Children</b> <b>First</b> album was released in 1980 and further cemented Van Halen's status. But in 1981, during the recording of the Fair Warning album, tensions rose. Eddie's desire for more serious and complex songs was at odds with Roth's poppy style. Nonetheless, Roth (and producer Templeman) acquiesced to Eddie's wishes.|$|E

25|$|Stella sank {{in eight}} minutes. Four {{lifeboats}} were successfully launched, while a fifth capsized. The women and <b>children</b> <b>first</b> protocol was observed, although one stewardess, Mary Ann Rogers, {{gave up her}} lifejacket and refused a place in a lifeboat. The capsized lifeboat was later righted by a freak wave and 12 people managed to climb into it. Four of these died of exposure during the night. The eight remaining survivors were rescued by the French Naval tug Marsouin.|$|E
25|$|In {{a similar}} study, Saffran found that adults and older <b>children</b> (<b>first</b> and second grade children) were also {{sensitive}} to syntactical information after exposure to an artificial language {{which had no}} cues to phrase structure other than the statistical regularities that were present. Both adults and children were able to pick out sentences that were ungrammatical at a rate greater than chance, even under an “incidental” exposure condition in which participants’ primary goal was to complete a different task while hearing the language.|$|E
25|$|Dynasty trust (also {{known as}} a generation-skipping trust): A type of trust in which assets are passed down to the grantor's grand{{children}}, not the grantor's children. The children of the grantor never take title to the assets. This allows the grantor to avoid the estate taxes that would apply if the assets were transferred {{to his or her}} <b>children</b> <b>first.</b> Generation-skipping trusts can still be used to provide financial benefits to a grantor's children, however, because any income generated by the trust's assets can be made accessible to the grantor's children while still leaving the assets in trust for the grandchildren.|$|E

25|$|Many {{lifeboats}} only carried half {{of their}} maximum capacity; there are many versions as to the reasoning behind half-filled lifeboats. Some sources claimed {{they were afraid of}} the lifeboat buckling under the weight, others suggested it was because the crew were following strict maritime tradition to evacuate women and <b>children</b> <b>first.</b> Additionally, doors and hatches were locked to prevent passengers on the lower decks from easily gaining access to and swamping the boats. Few men were allowed into the lifeboats on the port side, while the starboard side only allowed many men into boats after women and children boarded. Some of the final lifeboats were overfilled, and passengers noticed the seawater line was near the rim on some of the lifeboats.|$|E
25|$|As {{it comes}} to word {{formation}} processes such as derivation and compounding, the earliest derivational suffixes {{to show up in}} children's speech are those they hear adults use most frequently. (-er as the *'doer' of the action such as walker.) When {{it comes to}} compounds, <b>children</b> <b>first</b> make up names for agents and instruments that they don't know by a pattern (N-N), though some of them do not follow the pattern (*cutter grass for grass cutter). Then, they might have the right structure but the words are inappropriate since English already has words with the intended meaning such as car-smoke = exhaust. This process points to a preference for building words from other words, thus place less demand on memory than learning an entirely new word for each concept.|$|E
25|$|Tony is then {{shocked when}} he discovers he has {{testicular}} cancer and tells Darren although refuses to tell Diane. Cindy later finds out about Tony's cancer. Sinead then {{gives birth to}} her baby Katy which Diane initially adopts although Sinead then wants the baby and moves in with drug-dealer Ste Hay (Kieron Richardson). Sinead then starts drug-dealing and is reported to social services. Tony accuses Diane of reporting Sinead and is furious with her. He then moves in with Cindy. Diane later finds out about Tony's cancer, however, and Tony and Diane then re-unite with Tony moving back in with Diane. In October 2013, Tony and Diane decide {{to go to the}} seaside the day that Tony will get the news about whether his cancer has cleared or not. Tony and Diane discover that they met when they were children at the same seaside they are at now. Diane suddenly goes in to labor and she is rushed to the hospital. Tony's phone frequently rings as he is about to be told the news about his cancer, although he refuses to pick up as he wants to see Diane give birth to their <b>children</b> <b>first.</b> Diane gives birth to a boy named Anthony (the name Diane knew Tony as when they met as children) and Dee Dee (the name Tony knew Diane as). After this, Tony picks up his phone and is thrilled when he is told that his cancer has been cleared.|$|E
