40|$|Entanglement in bipartite continuous-variable {{systems is}} {{investigated}} {{in the presence}} of <b>partial</b> <b>losses</b> such as those introduced by a realistic quantum communication channel, e. g., by propagation in an optical fiber. We find that entanglement can vanish completely for <b>partial</b> <b>losses,</b> in a situation reminiscent of so-called entanglement sudden death. Even states with extreme squeezing may become separable after propagation in lossy channels. Having in mind the potential applications of such entangled light beams to optical communications, we investigate the conditions under which entanglement can survive for all <b>partial</b> <b>losses.</b> Different loss scenarios are examined, and we derive criteria to test the robustness of entangled states. These criteria are necessary and sufficient for Gaussian states. Our study provides a framework to investigate the robustness of continuous-variable entanglement in more complex multipartite systems...|$|R

Control effectiveness factors and stuck magnitudes are used to quantify faults entering control systems through actuators. Pseudorandom excitation inputs are used to help distinguish <b>partial</b> <b>loss</b> and stuck faults.

In {{order to}} {{determine}} the pipeline characteristics of the sand-wind simulation system, using the closed wind tunnel system, the <b>partial</b> <b>loss</b> of the fan’s pre-axial guide device was obtained from experiments at different openings. The <b>partial</b> <b>loss</b> of the axial guide device was simulated at different boundary conditions with FLUENT [1].

40|$|Perforin, a pore-forming toxin {{released}} from secretory granules of NK cells and CTLs, {{is essential for}} their cytotoxic activity against infected or cancerous target cells. Bi-allelic loss-of-function mutations in the perforin gene are invariably associated with a fatal immunoregulatory disorder, familial haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type 2 (FHL 2), in infants. More recently, {{it has also been}} recognized that <b>partial</b> <b>loss</b> of perforin function can cause disease in later life, including delayed onset FHL 2 and haematological malignancies. Herein we report a family in which a wide range of systemic inflammatory and neoplastic manifestations have occurred across three generations. We found that disease was linked to two missense perforin gene mutations (encoding A 91 V, R 410 W) that cause protein misfolding and <b>partial</b> <b>loss</b> of activity. These cases link the <b>partial</b> <b>loss</b> of perforin function with some solid tumours that are known to be controlled by the immune system, as well as haematological cancers. Our findings also demonstrate that perforin gene mutations can contribute to hereditary cancer predisposition...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{conventional}} {{idea for}} the determination of high energy muons is as follows: the energies of the muon are determined from their energy <b>losses</b> (<b>partial</b> energy <b>losses)</b> and their energy losses are proportional to their Cherenkov light yields. On the contrary to this conventional idea, we examine the interrelation between the <b>partial</b> energy <b>losses</b> and their primary energies of the muons and {{the correlation between the}} <b>partial</b> energy <b>losses</b> and the corresponding Cherenkov light yields in stochastic manner and discuss the application limits to the conventional procedure...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the endogenous {{formation of a}} partnership as the trade-off between efficiency gains and a 'cost' associated with the <b>partial</b> <b>loss</b> {{of control over the}} decisions the partnership takes. For instance, by forming a monetary union, countries benefit from a more coordinated monetary policy. However, due to the <b>partial</b> <b>loss</b> of control over the union decision, the policy implemented might differ from the policy a member would have taken on their own. We interpret this possible difference as a cost. We notably show that individuals with 'similar' characteristics form a partnership, and the more diverse the characteristics, the smaller the partnership size...|$|R

40|$|SERCA), encoded by ATP 2 A 2, is an {{essential}} component for G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) -dependent Ca 2 + signaling. However, whether the changes in Ca 2 + signaling and Ca 2 + signaling proteins in parotid acinar cells are affected by a <b>partial</b> <b>loss</b> of SERCA 2 are not known. Materials and Methods: In SERCA 2 +/- mouse parotid gland acinar cells, Ca 2 + signaling, expression levels of Ca 2 + signaling proteins, and amylase secretion were investigated. Results: SERCA 2 +/- mice showed decreased SERCA 2 expression and an upregulation of the plasma membrane Ca 2 + ATPase. A <b>partial</b> <b>loss</b> of SERCA 2 changed the expression level of 1, 4, 5 -tris-inositolphosphate receptors (IP 3 Rs), but the localization and activities of IP 3 Rs were not altered. In SERCA 2 +/- mice, muscarinic stimulation resulted in greater amylase release, and the expression of synaptotagmin was increased compared to wild type mice. Conclusion: These results suggest that a <b>partial</b> <b>loss</b> of SERCA 2 affects the expression and activity of Ca 2 + signaling proteins in the parotid gland acini, however, overall Ca 2 + signaling is unchanged...|$|R
