5|$|The aim of cognition-oriented treatments, {{which include}} reality {{orientation}} and cognitive retraining, is {{the reduction of}} cognitive deficits. Reality orientation <b>consists</b> <b>in</b> the presentation of information about time, place or person to ease {{the understanding of the}} person about its surroundings and his or her place in them. On the other hand, cognitive retraining tries to improve impaired capacities by exercitation of mental abilities. Both have shown some efficacy improving cognitive capacities, although in some studies these effects were transient and negative effects, such as frustration, have also been reported.|$|E
5|$|This species {{appears to}} have been confounded with C.distans; and from Lightfoot's {{description}} of the green angles of the fruit, I presume it to have been what he intended under that name. It is considerably larger than the real distans, the spikes black intermixed with green rather than yellowish, and the female ones often branched or compounded at their base. Its most essential and decisive character however <b>consists</b> <b>in</b> the two strong deep-green nerves or ribs which run along each side of the fruit externally near the edge. The arillus is also broader and more compressed than in C.distans.|$|E

50|$|In May 2000, the Ceará state {{government}} started {{to reform the}} stadium. The reformations were divided in three stages, and started on May 16, 2001. The first stage <b>consisted</b> <b>in</b> {{the recovery of the}} ditches, and of the bleachers junctions, as well as the recovery of the low walls. The second stage of the reformation started on July 20, 2001, and <b>consisted</b> <b>in</b> the recovery and strengthening of the stadium's physical structure.

50|$|The season <b>consisted</b> <b>in</b> six phases. The first phase, Torneo Apertura, had a {{round-robin}} format. The {{second phase}} <b>consisted</b> <b>in</b> a Pentagonal (three groups of five teams each one, playing {{against each other}} at home and away). The third phase, Torneo Finalización, had a similar format that Torneo Apertura. The fourth phase, Cuadrangular Inicial, <b>consisted</b> <b>in</b> two groups of four teams each one, playing against each other at home and away. The others phases, Repechaje and the finals, were not played due the cancellation of the tournament.|$|R
5|$|The Egyptologists {{identifying}} Sheshi with Salitis follow Josephus, Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius {{who report}} that Manetho credited Salitis with 19 years of reign in his Aegyptiaca. Ryholt relies instead on a statistical method and estimates {{the duration of}} Sheshi's reign to have been between 20 and 53 years. The method <b>consists</b> <b>in</b> tallying the seals of Yakbim Sekhaenre, Ya'ammu Nubwoserre, Qareh Khawoserre and 'Ammu Ahotepre with those of Sheshi. Then, knowing that the first four of these kings reigned for at least c. 30 years, implies that they have left between 7.5 and 20 seals per year on throne. Consequently, Sheshi's nearly 400 scarabs would correspond to 20 to 53 years, which Ryholt gives as c. 40 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{first line}} of defence <b>consists</b> <b>in</b> {{avoiding}} detection, through mechanisms such as camouflage, living underground, or nocturnality. Alternatively, prey animals may ward off attack, whether by advertising the presence of strong defences in aposematism, by mimicking animals which do possess such defences, by startling the attacker, by signalling to the predator that pursuit is not worthwhile, by distraction, by using defensive structures such as spines, and by living in a group. Members of groups are at reduced risk of predation, despite the increased conspicuousness of a group, through improved vigilance, predator confusion, and {{the likelihood that the}} predator will attack some other individual.|$|E

25|$|In some algorithms, an {{intermediate}} result is computed {{in a larger}} precision, then must be rounded to the final precision. Double rounding can be avoided by choosing an adequate rounding for the intermediate computation. This <b>consists</b> <b>in</b> avoiding to round to midpoints for the final rounding (except when the midpoint is exact). In binary arithmetic, {{the idea is to}} round the result toward zero, and set the least significant bit to 1 if the rounded result is inexact; this rounding is called sticky rounding. Equivalently, it <b>consists</b> <b>in</b> returning the intermediate result when it is exactly representable, and the nearest floating-point number with an odd significand otherwise; this is why it is also known as rounding to odd.|$|E
