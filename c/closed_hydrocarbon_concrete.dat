Due to this, highstrength concrete is particularly qualified for building catchment and barrier constructions. However, a penetration of the hardened cement materials by Trichlorethylene effects an extraction of water and a coarsening of the pore structure. In addition to this, chloride ions are produced in the structure of cement bound materials by the decay of Trichlorethylene.

40|$|Earthquakes {{occurring}} <b>close</b> to <b>hydrocarbon</b> fields under production {{are often}} under critical view of being induced or triggered. However, clear and testable rules to discriminate the different events have rarely been developed and tested. The unresolved scientific problem {{may lead to}} lengthy public disputes with unpredictable impact on the local acceptance of the exploitation and field operations. We propose a quantitative approach to discriminate induced, triggered and natural earthquakes, {{which is based on}} testable input parameters. Maxima of occurrence probabilities are compared for the cases under question, and a single probability of being triggered or induced is reported. The uncertainties of earthquake location and other input parameters are considered in terms of the integration over probability density functions (pdf). The probability that events have been human-triggered/induced is derived from the modeling of Coulomb stress changes and a rate and state dependent seismicity model. In our case a 3 D boundary element method has been adapted for the nuclei of strain approach to estimate the stress changes outside the reservoir, which are related to pore pressure changes in the field formation. The predicted rate of natural earthquakes is either derived from the background seismicity or, in case of rare events, from an estimate of the tectonic stress rate. Instrumentally derived, seismological information on the event location, source mechanism {{and the size of the}} rupture plane is of advantage for the method. If the rupture plane has been estimated, the discrimination between induced or only triggered events is theoretically possible if probability functions are convolved with a rupture fault filter. We apply the approach to three recent main-shock events: (1) the Mw 4. 3 Ekofisk 2001, North Sea earthquake close to the Ekofisk oil field, the 2004 Mw 4. 4 Rotenburg, Northern Germany earthquake in the vicinity of the Söhlingen gas field, and the Mw 6. 1 Emilia 2012, Northern Italy earthquake in the vicinity of a hydrocarbon reservoir.

We relocate 40 well-recorded earthquakes with MW prevailingly ≥ 4. 0 in the time interval from May 20 to June 12, 2012, plus an event that occurred in a nearby area on July 17, 2011 (MW 5. 0).

A DLGPC molecule has two saturated 24 -carbon acyl chains, giving the hydrocarbon core thickness of the monolayer approximately 28 A, which is <b>close</b> to the <b>hydrocarbon</b> core thickness of a membrane of a living system. NP(N) gammaT ensemble was used to reproduce the experimental observations, such as area/lipid, because surface tension is an essential factor in determining the monolayer structure. Data analysis on DLGPC/water monolayer shows that various liquid condensed-phase properties of the monolayer have been well reproduced from the simulation, indicating that surface tension 22. 9 mN/M used in the simulation is an appropriate condition for the condensed-phase NP(N) gammaT simulation. The simulation results suggest that this long-chain phospholipid monolayer shares many structural characteristics with typical short-chain 1, 2 -diacylphosphatidylcholine systems, such as DPPC/water monolayer in the condensed phase and DPPC/water bilayer in the gel phase. Furthermore, {{it was found that}} DLGPC/water monolayer has almost completely rotationally disordered acyl chains, which have not been observed so far in short-chain 1, 2 -diacylphosphatidylcholine/water bilayers.

The structural {{changes at the}} level of the head groups and the hydrocarbon chains as induced by the incorporation of phloretin and its analogues were investigated with deuterium and phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance. Membranes composed of 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (POPC) were selectively deuterated at the choline head group and at the hydrocarbon chains, and 2 H and 31 P NMR spectra were recorded with varying concentrations of dipolar agents. Incorporation of phloretin leaves the bilayer structure intact, induces only a small disordering of the hydrocarbon chains, and has no significant effect on the head-group dynamics. On the other hand, quite distinct structural changes are observed for the phosphocholine head group. While the -P-N+ dipole is oriented approximately parallel to the membrane surface for pure POPC bilayers, addition of phloretin, and to a lesser extent 4 -hydroxyvalerophenone and 2 -hydroxy-omega-phenylpropiophenone, rotates the N+ end of the -P-N+ dipole <b>closer</b> to the <b>hydrocarbon</b> layer. The resulting normal component of the -P-N+ dipole partly compensates the electric field of the dipolar agents. In addition to this structural change, phloretin also modifies the hydration layer at the lipid-water interface. Much less 2 H 2 O is adsorbed to the membrane surface when the bilayer contains phloretin, 4 -hydroxyvalerophenone, or 2 -hydroxy-omega-phenylpropiophenone. Moreover, a rather large change in the residual phosphorus chemical shielding anisotropy argues in favor of hydrogen-bond formation between the phosphate segment and the phloretin hydroxyl groups...|$|R
40|$|Geochemical {{characteristics}} in subsurface fluid systems provide {{a wealth of}} information about fluid sources, migration and storage conditions. Determining the extent of fluid communication in an aquifer system is complicated by multiphase systems containing oil, gas, water or supercritical fluids. For example, a buoyant gas phase may have a different transport pathway than the residual water, and thus there is potential to change geochemical signals over time. The residence time of fluids is critical in such systems and can vary from {{tens of thousands of years}} to billions of years. Our understanding of the length-scales in multiphase systems, while equally important, is more limited. Noble gas data from the Rotliegend natural gas field, northern Germany are used here to determine the length-scale and isolation-age of the combined water-gas system. We show that geologically bound volume estimates (i. e., gas-to-water volume ratios) match closed-system noble gas model predictions, suggesting the Rotliegend system has remained isolated as a <b>closed</b> system since <b>hydrocarbon</b> formation. Radiogenic helium data reveal the age of reservoir filling and corroborate long-term geologic isolation (63 – 129 Ma). It is critical that we have the ability to distinguish between fluid systems that – despite phase separation – have remained closed to fluid loss, from those that have lost oil or gas phases. These findings are the first to demonstrate that such systems remain isolated and fully gas-retentive on timescales > 100 Ma over km length scales and have broad implications for saline aquifer CO 2 disposal site viability and hydrocarbon resource prediction, which both require an understanding of the length-scales of crustal fluid transport pathways. </p...|$|R
40|$|This study reviews {{methods used}} to {{determine}} important characteristics of giant planet’s UV aurora (brightness,energy of the precipitating particles, altitude of the emission peak,...), based on the absorbing properties of methane and other hydrocarbons. Ultraviolet aurorae on giant planets are mostly caused by inelastic collisions between energetic magnetospheric electrons and the ambient atmospheric H 2 molecules. The auroral emission is situated <b>close</b> to a <b>hydrocarbon</b> layer and may be attenuated by methane (CH 4), ethane (C 2 H 6) and acetylene (C 2 H 2) at selected wavelengths. As methane is the most abundant hydrocarbon, it is the main UV absorber and attenuates the auroral emission shorward of 1350 Å. The level of absorption is used to situate the altitude/pressure level of the aurora, hence {{the energy of the}} precipitated electrons, whose penetration depth is directly related to their mean energy. Several techniques are used to determine these characteristics, from the color ratio method which measures the level of absorption from the ratio between an absorbed and an unabsorbed portion of the observed auroral spectrum, to more realistic methods which combine theoretical distributions of the precipitating electrons with altitude dependent atmospheric models. The latter models are coupled with synthetic or laboratory H 2 spectra and the simulated emergent spectra are compared to observations to determine the best auroral characteristics. Although auroral characteristics may be very variable with time and locations, several typical properties may be highlighted from these methods: the Jovian aurora is the most powerful, with brightness around 120 kR produced by electrons of mean energy 100 keV and an emission situated near the 1 lbar level (250 km above the 1 bar level) while Saturn’s aurora is fainter (10 kR), produced by electrons less than 20 keV and situated near the 0. 2 lbar level (1100 km).

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. The Anahuac Formation at Damon Mound, Texas includes a fault block of the Heterostegina limestone (Oligocene), raised to the surface by Cenozoic salt tectonism. Four cores drilled into the reef complex by Dresser Minerals (29 - 77, 19 - 77, 19 - A- 77, and L- 5) have been studied for calcareous algal succession paleoecological interpretation and isotopic diagenesis. The Damon Mound reef complex is an ancient analog to present Gulf Coast bathymetric highs. The reef column represents a sequence beginning with deep water substrata colonized by Porites douvillei shoaling upward into a massive reef boundstone. The column evidences numerous attempts at early colonization and emergence from a nepheloid layer. The succession of calcareous algae suggests a number of characteristic assemblages reflecting general paleoecological zonation and depth correlation between the four Dresser cores. Morphological adaptations suggest the presence of increasing herbivore pressure with the advancement of the reef complex and decreasing terrigenous sedimentation. Fifty-six isotopic analyses were performed at spaced intervals along the coralline algal bearing regions of the Dresser cores. Intergranular whole-rock drillings were used to minimize vital effects and focus the study on diagenesis. The isotopic data from the Heterostegina limestone exhibited a narrow range of values from - 5. 15 to - 2. 04 %o (O?. 030 %o) for 8180 and - 4. 85 to + 1. 36 %o (O?. 025 %o) for 813 C.

The whole volume of irradiated solution was 4. 000 ± 0. 005 L, the ratio between this volume and the geometrical apparent surface of the irradiated side of the photocatalytic membrane was 3. 8 ± 0. 1 cm, and the absorbed power 0. 30 W/cm (cylindrical geometry). A kinetic model was used, by which mineralisation of substrate to CO 2 was supposed to occur, by kinetic constants k 1, through one single intermediate, mediating the behaviour of all the numerous real intermediates formed in the path from the substrate to CO 2 (kinetic constants of formation of the latter being k 2). A competitive Langmuirian adsorption of both substrate and “intermediate” was also supposed to be operative, as expressed by apparent adsorption constants k 1 and k 2, possessing a, partly at least, kinetic significance. By Langmuir-Hinshelwood treatment of initial rate data, starting values of the k and K couples were obtained, from which, by a set of differential equations, the final optimised parameters, k 1 and k 1, k 2 and K 2, were calculated, able fit the whole photomineralisation curve, and not only its initial segment, as the Langmuirian parameters do.

Semibenzene methyl 7, 7 -diphenyl-p-mentha- 1 (7), 2, 5 -triene- 8 -carboxylate (1), {{which can}} be {{regarded}} as the para recombination product of triphenylmethyl and methyl isobutyryl radicals (5), affords exactly these intermediates on thermolysis or, inefficiently, on direct photolysis. Whereas thiophenol or triplet 9 -fluorenone aromatize 1, thermolysis in the presence of 1, 4 -cyclohexadiene allows trapping of 5 and oligomeric radicals. From the measured heat of aromatization, the C-C bond dissociation enthalpy of 1 and its analog lacking the side chain ("p-isotriphenylmethane") is calculated to be the lowest value known for any <b>closed</b> shell neutral <b>hydrocarbon.</b> Exposure of 1 to the atmosphere causes rapid autoxidation to the hydroperoxide. Part II. The thermolysis of 2, 3 -dimethyl- 2, 3 -bis(phenylazo) butane (16 a) leads exclusively to cleavage of the central C-C bond forming 2 -(phenylazo) isopropyl radicals (17 a). These radicals recombine to the C-N dimer 19 a about 40 times faster than to the more stable C-C dimer 16 a. The thermolysis of 2, 3 -dimethyl- 2, 3 -bis(tert-butylazo) butane (16 b) leads to C-N homolysis via a short lived β-azo radical 18 b. A mechanistic study of 16 b shows that C-N homolysis greatly dominates over C-C homolysis. Nevertheless, we estimate that the latter process would occur with ΔG† (150 ∘C) > 40. 3 kcal/mol, which implies that the RSE of aliphatic hydrazonyl radical 17 b is at least 6 kcal/mol below that of 17 a, and it is little or no more than the RSE of the 1, 1 -dimethylallyl radical. The nature of the decomposition products of 2 -cyclopropylazo- 2 -(phenylazo) -propane (26) suggests that the thermolysis of 26 mainly causes cleavage of one C-N bond on the cyclopropyl side, while photolysis of 26 leads to the predominant cleavage of the C-N bond on the phenyl side. Attempted determination of the heat of hydrogenation of the N=N double bond via catalytic hydrogenation of azo-n-butane (ANB) and oxidation of di-n-butyl hydrazine (DNBH) by HgO and O 2 gave varying values of ΔH H centering around 20 kcal/mol. 3 -Methyl- 1 -phenyl- 3 -(phenylazo) -butene- 1 (20) was prepared to study the thermolysis kinetics.

The emergence of “new” independent states in the region, such as Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, changed the geopolitical situation and put {{a question of the}} legal status of the Caspian Sea. Russian-Persian and Soviet-Iranian agreements had a centuries-old tradition but they did not draw up a legal status of the Caspian Sea or clarify the procedures of subsursafe management. Those agreements governed only laid down rules of navigation and fishery, without touching the issues of oil and gas field exploration, production and transportation, including pipelines {{on the floor of the}} Caspian Sea. It did not fit political and economic interests of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan and stimulate them to unilateral actions. Russia and Iran in turn insisted on saving the former rules and agreements. The absence of Convention on legal status of the Caspian Sea introduced uncertainty in the principles of oil and gas development and export, pushing Caspian countries toward making unilateral decisions. Russia and Iran kept close positions, insisting on following the former agreements. The other Caspian countries did not support that position and adopted a policy aimed at division of the Caspian Sea and asserting a certain control over its <b>hydrocarbons.</b> <b>Close</b> Russian and Iranian positions on legal status of the Caspian Sea became a strong deterrent for Caspian countries to let them divide the sea into national sectors and launch pipeline plans on the floor of the Caspian Sea. As the result Russian and Iranian relations had stabilizing effect in the Caspian region. At the same time, the Russian Federation aimed at following a flexible policy, taking into account the interests of the other Caspian countries. The settlement of the legal status of the Caspian Sea with Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan let Russia improve the relations with its neighbors but was not approved by Iran. Russian-Iranian relations were influenced by a profound effect of some western states, that imposed sanctions against Iran. Moreover, the fact that Iran was neglected when the export hydrocarbons routes were discussed and realized let new Caspian countries strengthen its positions.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{research for}} the past year on methods to enhance the environmental and economic performance of dry cooling towers. The work has concentrated on dry cooling towers utilizing periodic water to air heat exchangers. Periodic towers have sheet metal discs partially submerged in hot, power plant condenser effluent. As the discs rotate, the discs alternately absorb heat from the effluent and discharge heat to the air. The means of heat transfer on the air side can be either evaporative and/or convective, depending upon the amount of effluent carried into the air side {{on the surface of the}} plates. An oil layer, floated on the water's surface, has been shown to be effective in eliminating water carry-over to the air side. The advantages of the periodic tower lie in the low cost of the discs and the ability to operate dry. A periodic tower should be significantly less expensive than a conventional dry tower fabricated with finned tubes. Further, since the periodic tower can also operate wet, by removing the oil film, the high capacity losses incurred during warm months by conventional dry towers can be eliminated. In the past year, tests on a 20 inch model of the periodic tower indicated that at operational speeds of the full sized disc, no noticeable churning of the oil layer ocurred. Heat transfer rates measured with the 20 inch model were 20 percent higher than predicted by an approximate analysis. Finally, silicone oils' low vapor pressure make them superior to hydrocarbon oils on the basis of evaporation rates, but their higher costs and possible ecological impact necessitates a <b>closer</b> look at <b>hydrocarbon</b> oils. Construction of the full scale test facility is complete. Shaped, rigid five foot diameter discs have been designed, fabricated, and assembled into an initial test module. Instrumentation for heat transfer tests is also complete; including instrumentation for measuring disc temperatures, and both air and water flow rates and temperatures. A parametric study of the oil film thickness on the air side of the test module has been completed. Measured thicknesses were 20 percent less than that previously predicted. This thinner oil layer means an increase in the disc heat transfer. A test apparatus to study the further enhancement of disc performance by surface roughening has been constructed, instrumented and calibrated. The apparatus has reproduced experimental friction factor and heat transfer coefficient curves for flat plates, and will be used to evaluate enhancement as a function of rib shape, size, spacings and Reynold's number. Visits to several architectural engineers across the country were made with representatives of Air Preheater Company to gage their acceptance of the rotary concept. All felt that if the reliability of the rotary concept could be demonstrated and the costs were less than equivalent conventional dry towers, the rotary desing would be the preferred choice. Based on these findings, Air Preheater is planning to do design and cost studies of the rotary concept for the coming year.

40|$|Well {{integrity}} {{is an important}} topic in oil and gas well operations. The intention is to control the reservoir fluids and well pressures, by technical, operational and organizational barriers. Inadequate barriers can lead to unwanted influx and cause a kick, which can escalate further into a blowout. 	The Deepwater Horizon accident in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 raised concerns {{about the safety of}} offshore deepwater drilling. This rig was considered to be an efficient and safe drilling unit, until the fatal blowout occurred leading to the loss of eleven lives, and the worst environmental disaster in US history. The main objective of a well barrier is to prevent leakage from the wellbore to the external environment during the various well operations. Well barriers are classified as primary or secondary barriers. The primary barriers are the barriers <b>closest</b> to the <b>hydrocarbons</b> and are the first obstacle to unwanted flow of formation fluid. The secondary barrier acts as a backup barrier. Barriers can further be classified as static or dynamic. The static barriers apply for the production phase, meaning that they are present {{over a longer period of}} time. Dynamic barriers occur during drilling and well intervention, and these are the once that are most difficult to assess because of the constantly changing parameters involved. Various drilling types such as overbalanced (conventional) and underbalanced drilling are used in the search for oil and gas. The main difference between these types, is how the pressure in the wellbore is maintained, and for this different barriers are needed. Laws and regulations dictate the requirements the industry has to follow. The Petroleum Safety Authority governs the regulations in Norway, and gives requirements to well barriers. In their regulations, they also refer to other guidelines and standards for more detailed requirements. NORSOK D- 010 from 2013, &# 147;Well integrity in drilling and well operations&# 148;, is a widely used standard which defines requirements and guidelines relating to well integrity in drilling and well activities. Ways to regulate is found to vary between countries, such as for Norway and the US. 	During drilling, a dynamic barrier situation applies, where the activation of the barrier depends on the current situation, and there is no pre-made sequence of barrier activation. Overall, this makes the assessment a difficult task. Various approaches have been suggested for the assessment of dynamic barriers over the years, with contributions to the topic from oil-companies, standards and research papers. Most of what has been suggested has some kind of weaknesses, and no common approach has been accepted and put into use by the industry. As a contribution a new approach has been suggested in this thesis. An overbalanced drilling operation in deep waters initiated by a kick is selected as case study. The approach is based on using two different types of analysis, in combination. An event tree is used to illustrate the dynamics of the event, and various fault trees are used to analyze the barriers involved. To understand what can cause a kick, the possibility of avoiding it, and what to do if it happens are given attention. From the suggested approach, it emerges that the human factor plays an important role in the kick evaluation and to maintain the well integrity. If the primary barrier is lost, there will be a kick. For this to escalate into a blowout, the secondary barrier must also be lost. If the control equipment functions as intended, lack of detection and understanding, together with insufficient training and competence of personnel can make this happen. 	To prevent major accidents and hazardous events in the future, it is important to learn and gain experience from previous incidents and learn from each other, and the ability to work together, also between companies, on these difficult topics. </p...|$|R
