In order to better understand the controversial frequency dependence of NBTI, we study the frequency de-pendence of <b>hole</b> <b>capture</b> on individual defects by extending the time-dependent defect spectroscopy (TDDS) to the AC case.

40|$|Traps at {{the surface}} of devices cause delayed {{response}} of drain current to a step change of gate voltage. This is known as gate lag. Gate lag is usually caused by surface hole trapping.

Gate lag increasingly affects device switching at increasing ungated recess extension, suggesting that responsible deep levels be located at the ungated, recess surface of the HFET. Gate lag diminishes by making the off-state gate-source voltage less negative and by increasing the drain bias. Increasing the temperature makes the turn-on transient faster at low drain bias, while slightly delaying it at high drain bias. Numerical device simulations accounting for acceptor-like traps at the ungated surface predict gate-lag phenomena in good agreement with experiments, reproducing correctly the observed bias and temperature dependences.

Contemplating the common functionality of forces in previous active contours models, we propose the geometric attraction-driven flow (GADF), the binary edge function, and the binary balloon forces to detect objects in difficult cases such as varying illumination and complex shapes. The orientation of GADF is orthogonally aligned with the boundary of object and has the opposite direction across the boundary. It prevents the leakage on the weak edge. To reduce the interference from other forces, we design the binary edge function using the property of orientation in GADF. We also design the binary balloon force based on the four-color theorem.

40|$|Five {{different}} {{models have been}} proposed {{in recent years to}} interpret the quasi-saturation of interface trap generation in PMOS Transistors due to Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI). We use both analytical and numerical methods to capture the essence of these models and show that these models predict very different temperature, thickness, and voltage dependence regarding the onset of quasi-saturation. These predictions should be compared with experiments to uniquely identify the origin of quasi-saturation of NBTI characteristics. The physical mechanism of quasi-saturation determines the extrapolated lifetime of PMOS transistors and has important implications for reliability of Silicon Integrated Circuits. Keywords: MOSFET, NBTI, Reliability Theory and Modeling, Reaction-diffusion model 1. Introduction and Background: Since late 1990 s, Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) of PMOS transistors has become the leading reliability concern for Silicon ICs [1 - 2]. The prevailing view of NBTI degradation (see Fig. 1) is that when PMOS is stressed in inversion by applying a negative gate voltage (VGS), Si-H bonds at the Si/SiO 2 interface <b>capture</b> <b>holes</b> from the inversion layer.

The devices with a lower doping density is found to exhibit a lower capture probability and a higher photoconductive gain. The most pronounced change in the trapping characteristics upon doping is observed at a negative bias polarity when the photoexcited holes move toward the δ-doping plane.

The latter is essential for reducing the effective carrier density available for Auger quenching during thermalization of hot carriers. Subsequent de-trapping of electrons from Sr-La-V-Br complexes can activate Ce dopants that have previously <b>captured</b> a <b>hole</b> leading to luminescence.
