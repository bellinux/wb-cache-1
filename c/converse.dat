5|$|However, {{this seems}} unlikely, given {{that no one}} has ever {{documented}} that female euglossines produce pheromones; male euglossines produce pheromones using the chemicals they collect from orchids, and these pheromones attract females, rather than the <b>converse,</b> as Cullina (2004) suggests.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} (i) {{the prevalence of}} <b>conversing</b> {{on a cell phone}} while driving in New Zealand, (ii) respondents' perception of risk regarding this behaviour and (iii) attitudes towards legislation banning cell phone use while driving. In addition, the study examined the association between the prevalence of <b>conversing</b> on a cell phone and risk perception. Anonymous, self-reported, survey data was collected via the internet from 1057 drivers nationwide regarding the frequency of <b>conversing</b> on a cell phone, including hands-free and hand-held <b>conversing,</b> risk perception, views on legislation, and demographic information. A positive relationship was found between the frequency of <b>conversing</b> on a cell phone and risk perception; that is, as the frequency of <b>conversing</b> on a cell phone increased, the perceived risk of this behaviour decreased...|$|R
40|$|Previous work {{on use of}} {{cell phones}} while driving {{compared}} cell phone conversations while driving with driving only conditions. This study investigated how <b>conversing</b> {{on a cell phone}} differs from <b>conversing</b> with a passenger. Participants <b>conversed</b> about close-call situations they experienced. We compared how well drivers followed task instructions when driving only, when driving and <b>conversing</b> on a cell phone, and when driving and <b>conversing</b> with a passenger. The results show that the number of driving errors was highest in the cell-phone condition. Analyzing the conversations we found that in passenger conversations more references were made to traffic and more turn taking followed those references than in cell phone conversations. The results show that passenger conversations differ from cell phone conversations because the surrounding traffic becomes a topic of the conversation, helping driver and passenger to share situation awareness, and mitigating the potential effects of conversation on driving...|$|R

5|$|The {{fundamental}} theorem of arithmetic {{applies to}} any Euclidean domain: Any number from a Euclidean domain can be factored uniquely into irreducible elements. Any Euclidean domain {{is a unique}} factorization domain (UFD), although the <b>converse</b> is not true. The Euclidean domains and the UFD's are subclasses of the GCD domains, domains in which a greatest common divisor of two numbers always exists. In other words, a greatest common divisor may exist (for all pairs of elements in a domain), although {{it may not be}} possible to find it using a Euclidean algorithm. A Euclidean domain is always a principal ideal domain (PID), an integral domain in which every ideal is a principal ideal. Again, the <b>converse</b> is not true: not every PID is a Euclidean domain.|$|E
5|$|Ai {{initially}} {{refuses to}} see a connection between his sexuality and his mode of consciousness, preventing him from truly understanding the Gethenians; thus {{he is unable to}} persuade them of the importance of his mission. Ai's failure to comprehend shifgrethor and to trust Estraven's motives leads him to misunderstand much of the advice that Estraven gives him. As Ai's relationship to Estraven changes, their communication also changes; they are both more willing to acknowledge mistakes, and make fewer assertions. Eventually, the two are able to <b>converse</b> directly with mindspeech, but only after Ai is able to understand Estraven's motivations, and no longer requires direct communication.|$|E

5|$|As Griet cleans Vermeer's studio, {{which his}} wife Catharina (Essie Davis) never enters, the painter begins to <b>converse</b> {{with her and}} {{encourages}} her appreciation of painting, light and color. Vermeer gives her lessons in mixing paints and other tasks, taking care to keep this secret from his wife, who would react with anger and jealousy if she found out {{that her husband was}} spending time with Griet. In contrast, Vermeer's pragmatic mother-in-law, Maria Thins (Judy Parfitt), sees Griet as useful to Vermeer's career.|$|E
5|$|Brawl allows {{players to}} play against distant opponents via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Online {{multiplayer}} games can be played either with registered friends or with randomly selected participants. Additionally, players can <b>converse</b> with up to four phrases that are preset by the player, which appear as speech bubbles when activated. These names and phrases are not displayed in random-player matches. The Spectator mode allows players to watch matches being played between other players, and bet on the outcome using coins earned within the game. The winner of the match earns a jackpot of coins.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, {{such as in}} the UK, hares are {{not always}} seen as pests, and there are species action plans aiming to {{significantly}} increase their numbers. Some coursers say that coursing assists conservation because it leads to sporting landowners creating a habitat suitable for hares. Opponents of coursing say that the <b>converse</b> is true, namely that coursing takes place where hares live rather than hares living where coursing takes place. It is also the case that coursing kills slower hares, and it is said by some coursers that this leaves faster hares to breed and multiply.|$|E

5|$|Every {{configuration}} of Rule 90 has exactly four predecessors, other configurations {{that form the}} given configuration after a single step. Therefore, in contrast to many other cellular automata such as Conway's Game of Life, Rule 90 has no Garden of Eden, a configuration with no predecessors. It {{provides an example of}} a cellular automaton that is surjective (each configuration has a predecessor) but not injective (it has sets of more than one configuration with the same successor), showing that the <b>converse</b> of the Garden of Eden theorem is not true.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Richard Bulliet of Columbia University {{wrote that}} the {{dromedary}} exists in large numbers in areas from which the Bactrian camel has disappeared; the <b>converse</b> is also true to a great extent.
