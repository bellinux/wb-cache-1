40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to assess whether current surveillance capacity is sufficient to fulfill EU and Danish regulations to control a hypothetical foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) epidemic in Denmark, and whether enlarging the protection and/or <b>surveillance</b> <b>zones</b> could minimize economic losses. The stochastic spatial simulation model DTU-DADS was further developed to simulate clinical surveillance of herds within the protection and <b>surveillance</b> <b>zones</b> and used to model spread of FMD between herds. A queuing system was included in the model, and based on daily surveillance capacity, which was 450 herds per day, it was decided whether herds appointed for surveillance would be surveyed on the current day or added to the queue. The model was run with a basic scenario representing the EU and Danish regulations, which includes a 3 km protection and 10 km <b>surveillance</b> <b>zone</b> around detected herds. In alternative scenarios, the protection zone was enlarged to 5 km, the <b>surveillance</b> <b>zone</b> was enlarged to 15 or 20 km, or a combined enlargement of the protection and <b>surveillance</b> <b>zones</b> was modelled. Sensitivity analysis included changing surveillance capacity to 200, 350 or 600 herds per day, frequency of repeated visits for herds in overlapping <b>surveillance</b> <b>zones</b> from every 14 days to every 7, 21 and 30 days, {{and the size of the}} zones combined with a surveillance capacity increased to 600 herds per day. The results showed that the default surveillance capacity is sufficient to survey herds on time. Extra resources for surveillance did not improve the situation, but fewer resources could result in larger epidemics and costs. Enlarging the protection zone was a better strategy than the basic scenario. Despite that enlarging the <b>surveillance</b> <b>zone</b> might result in shorter epidemic duration, and lower number of affected herds, it resulted frequently in larger economic losses...|$|R

40|$|An {{epidemic}} of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in a FMD-free country with large exports of livestock and livestock products {{would result in}} profound economic damage. This could be reduced by rapid and efficient control of the disease spread. The objectives {{of this study were}} to estimate the economic impact of a hypothetical FMD outbreak in Denmark based on changes to the economic assumptions of the model, and to investigate whether the control of an FMD epidemic can be improved by combining the enlargement of protection or <b>surveillance</b> <b>zones</b> with pre-emptive depopulation or emergency vaccination. The stochastic spatial simulation model DTU-DADS was used to simulate the spread of FMD in Denmark. The control strategies were: the basic EU and Danish strategy; pre-emptive depopulation; suppressive or protective vaccination; enlarging protection or <b>surveillance</b> <b>zones,</b> and a combination of pre-emptive depopulation or emergency vaccination with enlarged protection or <b>surveillance</b> <b>zones.</b> Herds are detected either based on basic detection through the appearance of clinical signs, or as a result of surveillance in the control zones. The economic analyses consisted of direct costs and export losses. Sensitivity analysis was performed on uncertain and potentially influential input parameters. Enlarging the <b>surveillance</b> <b>zones</b> from 10 km to 15 km, combined with pre-emptive depopulation over a 1 km radius around detected herds resulted in the lowest total costs. This was still the case even when the different input parameters were changed in the sensitivity analysis. Changing the resources for clinical surveillance did not affect the epidemic consequences. In conclusion, an FMD epidemic in Denmark would have a larger economic impact on the agricultural sector than previously anticipated. Furthermore, the control of a potential FMD outbreak in Denmark may be improved by combining pre-emptive depopulation with an enlarged protection or <b>surveillance</b> <b>zone...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract The first {{documented}} {{transmission of}} Chikungunya within Europe {{took place in}} Italy {{during the summer of}} 2007. Chikungunya, a viral infection affecting millions of people across Africa and Asia, can be debilitating and no prophylactic treatment exists.

This paper proposed pan-European <b>surveillance</b> <b>zones</b> for Chikungunya, based on the climatic conditions necessary for vector activity and viral transmission. Pan-European surveillance provides the best hope for an early-warning of outbreaks, because national boundaries do not play a role in defining the risk of this new vector borne disease threat.
