50|$|Doug Campbell was an {{agricultural}} academic concerned about soil erosion. He had been suggesting {{the spread of}} both seed and fertiliser for erosion control and aerial spreading of trace minerals since the 1930s, but had not conducted trials until he met Pritchard. Campbell brought official backing and academic responsibility to Pritchard's work. Immediately after the war, he obtained permission to build a sheet metal hopper for ZK-AFH to test the spread of bluestone crystals. In 1946 the first pure topdressing flight was conducted without seed. Mixtures of bluestone crystals, sulphate of ammonia, slaked lime and carbon black were used. The lack of a lid for the hopper initially resulted in irritating dust spreading through the aircraft in turbulence: in cold wet conditions {{it was necessary to}} heat the hopper to prevent the fertiliser coagulating, while in dry conditions the powder tended to disperse in the wind before reaching the ground. Nevertheless, in July Campbell arranged for ZK-AFH to topdress 1,100 acres (4.5 km2) of a copper-deficient farm. In August 1947 trials with <b>cobalt</b> <b>sulphate</b> in liquid form were conducted on the farm of K. M. Hickson near Taumarunui, with a horseback-mounted radio used to convey results to the pilot. It was soon suggested that cobaltised superphosphate would be easier to spread, although it was felt a specialised aircraft would be needed to do this.|$|E

40|$|The electrocrystallisation of cobalt onto a glassy carbon {{electrode}} from <b>cobalt</b> <b>sulphate</b> electrolytes either {{with or without}} the addition of a small amount of copper ions was investigated through the electrochemical techniques of cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. Voltammetric results showed that the cobalt deposits obtained were impure and the overpotential for cobalt nucleation was low for electrolyte {{with a small amount of}} copper ions. Analysis of the current - time transients by chronoamperometry indicated that the nucleation mechanism of cobalt in <b>cobalt</b> <b>sulphate</b> solution occurred by a combination of two different kinds of parallel nucleation processes, instantaneous or progressive nucleation with two-dimensional or three-dimensional growth, which depended on the overpotential applied. However, in the presence of copper ions, the nucleation mechanism was in accordance with 3 D growth under diffusion control. Progressive nucleation occurred at a lower overpotential and instantaneous nucleation at a higher overpotential. The deviation of the experimental data from the theoretical model was explained...|$|E

40|$|Zinc-free cobalt {{deposits}} {{cannot be}} obtained from sulphate solutions even when Zn 2 + is present only in traces in the solution. In a 1 M solution of zinc and <b>cobalt</b> <b>sulphates,</b> if there is less than 6 per cent M ZnSO 4 the proportion of zinc in the deposits {{is about the same}} as in the solution, although the cathode potential is not below - 800 mV (sce). However, the presence of zinc favours hydrogen evolution. In solutions containing more than 6 per cent of M ZnSO 4 the proportion of zinc in the deposit is much higher than that in the solution. There is a limiting current density and the cathode potential falls below - 1 000 mV (sce). Microscopic observations during the electrolysis confirm an inhibition of the nucleation of the cobalt deposit. This {{can be explained by the}} preferential adsorption of the Zn 2 + cations on the surface. The increase in the hydrogen evolution thereby results in the formation of a zinc hydroxide film covering the surface, which allows, but at a more negative potential, the preferential discharge of Zn 2 + ions, as shown by the structure of the deposits in distinct layers. © 1965.

The current efficiency is more than 90 % in most cases and is highest {{in the case of}} D 2 EHPA (96 %) and lowest with VERSATIC 10 (86 %). The cathodic polarization from cyclic voltammetry indicates that the exchange current density (i 0) value is higher in the presence of organic impurities than in solutions containing no organic impurities. The organic impurities indicate an inhibition of electrocrystallization process due to suppression of nucleation. Cathodic polarization also indicates that Co 2 + reduction occurs slightly at less negative potential in solution containing organic impurities...|$|R

A variety of mechanism of cobalt redisisolution have been proposed in the literatures, however, {{it is still not}} very well understood. The influencing factors of cobalt redissolution such as detention time, oxidation, particle size of zinc dust and copper ion have been investigated in this paper. The redissolution does not occur when very large particles are used but the redissolution of cobalt is significant from small zinc particles. The redissolution is obvious with copper ion added, while the redissolution is not occurred from the zinc sulphated solution without copper ion added.

40|$|Producing {{nickel and}} cobalt metal by high {{pressure}} acid leaching (HPAL) of nickel laterites is {{becoming one of}} Australia's largest mineral processing industries. However, the background chemical information for this process, including the fundamental physicochemical properties of acidic metal sulphate leachate solutions, is not well known. In order to improve the efficiency of current and future HPAL plants, high quality physicochemical and thermodynamic data will be necessary. This thesis reports measurements on the densities and heat capacities of nickel and <b>cobalt</b> <b>sulphate</b> solutions and their mixtures along with detailed studies {{of the nature of}} the species present and the thermodynamics of their interconversions. Densities and heat capacities of nickel and <b>cobalt</b> <b>sulphate</b> and perchlorate solutions and their ternary mixtures were measured using a vibrating tube densimeter and a flow microcalorimeter respectively. These data were used to calculate the apparent molal volumes and heat capacities of these solutions. Standard partial molal quantities were then obtained by appropriate extrapolation procedures, along with the volume and heat capacity changes of ion pair formation. A comparison has been made between experimental densities and heat capacities with those predicted by Young's rule. Good agreement was obtained except when the degree of complexation varied significantly in the mixtures. The various ion pair species in nickel and <b>cobalt</b> <b>sulphate</b> solutions, along with those of magnesium sulphate (which is a major impurity in HPAL leachates), were reinvestigated by dielectric relaxation spectroscopy. Doubly solvent separated ion pairs, solvent shared ion pairs and contact ion pairs were shown to exist simultaneously in solution and their concentrations were determined from dilute to near-saturated concentrations. Evidence for the possible existence of a triple ion, M 2 SO 4 2 +, was also obtained in highly concentrated solutions. The equilibrium constants of the stepwise reactions and the effective hydration numbers of ions and ion pairs were also calculated. The heats of complexation of nickel(II) and cobalt(II) sulphate were determined at different ionic strengths in sodium perchlorate media by titration calorimetry. These data were fitted to a specific ion interaction model to obtain the standard state values. The corresponding entropies of complexation were calculated and were found to be the major contributor to the stability of the complexes...|$|E

NO reduction with C 3 H 6 {{in the presence}} of excess O- 2 was studied in a flow apparatus fed by a reactant mixture of NO:C 3 H 6 :O- 2 = 4000 : 2000 : 20, 000 ppm in He. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results showed that the presence of sulphates prevented the formation Of Co 3 O 4. XPS indicated the presence of Co(II) alone. Irrespective of the preparation method, Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) showed that catalysts with the same sulphate content had the same covalent sulphates. As the sulphate content in the sample increased, FTIR with CO or NO showed that the Lewis acid-strength of Co(II) increased, whereas the reducibility and heterogeneity of Co(II) decreased. Sulphated samples with a cobalt content higher than 2 atoms nm(- 2) were far more active and selective than the corresponding unsulphated CoOx/ZrO 2. The presence of sulphates had a weaker effect on the catalytic behaviour of samples with lower Co content (< 2 atoms nm(- 2)).

Using the moving Preisach model, the reversible (Mrev) and irreversible (Mirr) components of the magnetization were separated. The parameter η given by η= (dMrev / dMirr) Hi and the moving Preisach parameter km, were evaluated according to the relation η= kmχrev in order to investigate the behavior of Mrev. It was found that η is not proportional to the reversible susceptibility, therefore km {{is a function of}} the internal field. Isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) and DC demagnetization (DCD) curves were measured. From these data the δm curve and the Henkel plot were obtained showing that all the points remain under the Wohlfath line indicating that the local disorder dominates (demagnetizing-like effect) over the mean-field effect. The switching field distribution curves were obtained by differentiation of the IRM and DCD curves. The peak values of these switching field distributions differ by a factor of 2. 7.

Iron and cobalt sulphates contaminate the {{nickel sulphate}} stream due to dissolution during the matte leach process. While iron is an unwanted contaminant, <b>cobalt</b> <b>sulphate</b> production presents a potentially valuable by-product, as long as removal of these metal ions does not introduce other forms of contamination into the solution. Experimental work was performed to evaluate the removal of 1 g/l cobalt and 3 g/l iron from a sulphuric acid leach solution containing 80 g/l nickel using solvent extraction with Ni-Cyanex 272. The effects of various process parameters on preloading, extraction, and stripping were investigated. Based on full factorial experimental designs, the parameters with the largest effects on the process performance were determined to be pH and organic/aqueous (O/A) ratio for preloading, nickel loading and O/A ratio for extraction, and H 2 SO 4 concentration and O/A ratio for stripping. These variables were evaluated in further batch experiments to determine conditions {{that would allow the}} production of a high purity nickel sulphate solution and selective stripping of cobalt and iron from the organic phase, and the batch tests results were validated by performing continuous tests on a laboratory scale mixer-settler setup. A flow sheet that allows the production of refined nickel sulphate and <b>cobalt</b> <b>sulphate</b> solutions by extraction with nickel preloaded Cyanex 272 and selective stripping has been proposed.

The nature of the coating, studied by X-ray diffraction and high-resolution electron microscopy (HREM), reveals the epitaxial growth of the CoFe_ 2 O_ 4 layer on γ-Fe_ 2 O_ 3 provided the extent of coating (X_Co) is maintained ≤ 30 wt%. The pores within the γ-Fe_ 2 O_ 3 particles are coherently filled up as deciphered by the continuity in the HREM lattice fringes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Allergic contact {{dermatitis}} {{is a well-known}} cause of hand eczema, although the influence of contact allergens on different clinical types of hand eczema remains still unclear. OBJECTIVE: To identify most common positive tested allergens among hand eczema patients and to define the relation between specific contact allergies and clinical types of hand eczema according to the guidelines of the Danish Contact Dermatitis Group (DCDG). METHODS: We included 1571 hand eczema subjects who were patch tested from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2013. They were retrospectively classified according to the guidelines of the DCDG into six clinical types: recurrent vesicular hand eczema, chronic fissured hand eczema, hyperkeratotic palmar eczema, pulpitis, interdigital eczema and nummular hand eczema according to a newly developed flow chart. The prevalence of sensitizations and association with clinical type, atopic dermatitis, age and gender were studied. RESULTS: A total of 1395 subjects were classified {{into one of the}} six clinical types. The most frequently found clinical types were recurrent vesicular hand eczema (39. 7 %) and chronic fissured hand eczema (35. 5 %). Subjects with recurrent vesicular hand eczema {{were significantly more likely to}} have a contact allergy (OR 1. 55), whereas subjects with hyperkeratotic palmar eczema and pulpitis were less likely to be sensitized (OR 0. 51; OR 0. 44). Overall, metals (nickel <b>sulphate,</b> <b>cobalt</b> chloride), fragrances and preservatives (methylchloroisothiazoline/methylisothiazoline, methyldibromoglutaronitrile) were the most frequent sensitizers in patients with hand eczema. This did not deviate in the different clinical types, although subjects with recurrent vesicular hand eczema were significantly more frequently sensitized to nickel sulphate and other allergens compared to other clinical types of hand eczema. CONCLUSION: In the diagnostic work up of hand eczema subjects with recurrent vesicular hand eczema should be patch tested, especially women of older age, although the need for patch testing in males with hyperkeratotic palmar eczema might be less imperative...|$|R
40|$|A {{fluid bed}} dryer with inert {{particles}} represents a very attractive alternative to other drying technologies according to the main efficiency criteria, i. e. specific water evaporation rate, specific heat consumption and speci­fic air consumption. A high drying efficiency results from the large con­tact area and from the large temperature difference between the inlet and outlet air. A rapid mixing of the particles leads to nearly isothermal conditions throughout the bed. A {{fluid bed dryer}} with inert particles was used for drying of slurries. Experiments were performed in a cylindrical column 215 mm in diameter with glass spheres as inert particles. In this paper, results of drying experi­ments with slurries of Zineb fungicide, copper hydroxide, calcium carbo­nate and pure water used as the feed material are presented. In our fluidized bed we successfully dried {{a number of other}} materials such as: fungicides and pesticides (Ziram, Propineb, Mangozeb, copper oxy-chloride, copper oxy-sulphate, Bordeaux mixture), other inorganic compounds (calcium <b>sulphate,</b> <b>cobalt</b> carbonate, electrolytic copper, sodium chloride), and a complex compound (organo-bentonite). The effects of operating conditions on dryer throughput and product quality were investigated. Main performance criteria, i. e. specific water evaporation rate, specific heat consumption and specific air consumption, were quantified. Temperature profile along the bed was mapped, and nearly isothermal conditions were found due to thorough mixing of the particles. Analysis of drying and energy efficiencies as a function of inlet and outlet air temperature difference was performed for deeper insight in dryer behavior and for optimizing dryer design and operation from an energy point of view. A simple mathematical model based on an overall heat balance predicts the dryer performance quite well. The industrial prototype with fluid bed of 0. 8 m in diameter and capacity 650 kg of evaporated moisture per hour was realized on the basis of presented investigations on pilot unit. The most important results are 50 % decrease in energy consumption and no-additional grinding of dried product in comparison with old tunnel drying technology...|$|R

The average thickness of the film, obtained by calibrated ion milling, was found to be close to the values obtained by integration of the deposition current. The barrier height of the rectifying Co/GaAs interface was measured as 0. 88 #+-# 0. 05 V. Metal coated optical fiber probes, prepared by melt-pulling, were used as 100 nm apertures for near-field electrochemical photolithography. In situ STM feedback was used to position a probe within 100 nm of a Co-on-n-GaAs working electrode. Etching of two parallel features was achieved by the anodic biasing of the electrode and using the carriers generated by the near-field illumination. The line width of approximately 2 #mu#m was consistent with the diffusion length of holes in GaAs. A shear-force feedback system was used to position a probe within a few nanometers of a p-InP electrode. An anodic pre-treatment was used to sensitise the surface to light, prior to the near-field deposition of <b>cobalt</b> from a <b>sulphate</b> solution. Granular deposits were produced, within 2. 5 #mu#m of the centre of illumination. A new transmission X-ray absorption method was developed, in which the electrodeposited cobalt-on-n-GaAs films were used as both the sample and detector. The new method produced comparable results to the established, total-electron-yield technique. The discrepancies in the absorption spectra obtained for films of different thickness were explained using models based on the surface roughness measurements. A potentially fundamental problem, caused by a contribution of Auger electrons from the metal to the photocurrent measured by the new system, was considered. Experimental evidence, however, suggested that the contribution was negligible. MXCD calculations, performed using the X-ray spectra obtained using both methods, were used to derive values of the spin and orbital moments of the electrodeposited films. The average spin moment was found to be 1. 77 by the new method and 1. 43 by the total electron yield method, compared to a theoretical value of 1. 52. The value obtained for the orbital moment was 0. 4 in both cases, compared to the theoretical value of 0. 15. The orbital moment is affected by the bonding in the film, which could explain the discrepancy. (A statistical error of 0. 14 % was estimated from the fluctuations in a horizontal section of the spectra. This is much lower that systematic errors caused by surface roughness and calibration drift, and was therefore not quoted).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), total antioxidant status (TAS) and expression of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp 70) of porcine ovarian granulosa cells cultured in vitro after cobalt (Co) administrations. Ovarian granulosa cells were incubated with <b>cobalt</b> <b>sulphate</b> administrations as follows: group E 1 (0. 09 mg. ml- 1), group E 2 (0. 13 mg. ml- 1), group E 3 (0. 17 mg. ml- 1), group E 4 (0. 33 mg. ml- 1), group E 5 (0. 5 mg. ml- 1) and the control group without any additions for 18 h. Co administration developed stress reaction and promoted accumulation of Hsp 70 what resulted in increasing activity of SOD. TAS of granulosa cells increased with higher doses of Co whereas low doses had no effect on this parameter. Trace elements can adversely affect animal female reproductive system and its functions, through either direct or indirect effects on oxidative stress induction...|$|E
40|$|Physical and {{chemical}} processes in hydrothermal solution in which colloidal silica took part were researched. The rate of nucleation of orthosilicic acid molecules H 4 SiO 4 were calculated {{with the help}} of mathematical model. The order and constants of rate of silicic acid polymerization reaction were determined. The sizes and diffusion coefficients of colloidal silica particles were measured. Mechanism of coagulation and precipitation of colloidal silica particles by metal cations was investigated. In the experiments various types of metal cations were added to the solution: Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Co 2 +, Cu 2 +, Pb 2 +, Al 3 +, Fe 3 +. Cations were added to the solution with slaked lime, calcium chloride, magnesium sulphate, <b>cobalt</b> <b>sulphate,</b> cupric sulphate, plumbous nitrate, aluminium sulphate, aluminium chloride, ferric chloride, sea water. Also cations were added by electrocoagulation on electrodes with soluble metals such as aluminium, ferric and cupric electrodes.

40|$|Cobalt {{hexagonal}} nanoplatelets and cobalt nanoflakes {{were produced}} by electrodeposition onto aluminium from <b>cobalt</b> <b>sulphate</b> solutions. The {{dependence of the}} nanostructure morphology on cobalt ion concentration and potential was investigated under potentiostatic and pulsed-electrodeposition. Under potentiostatic electrodeposition, cobalt hexagonal nanoplatelets were obtained with cobalt ion concentration equal to 0. 01 and 0. 1 M, while cobalt hydroxide nanoflakes were formed as the cobalt ion concentration was increased to 0. 2 M. Under pulsed electrodeposition, both hexagonal nanoplatelets and hydroxide nanoflakes could be obtained with cobalt ion concentration equal to 0. 1 M by modulation of the imposed current/potential wave. The analysis of the current transients recorded under potentiostatic electrodeposition and the microscopic analysis of the deposits indicate that three-dimensional diffusion control cannot adequately describe {{the growth of the}} cobalt nanostructures. We propose that an aggregative growth mechanism involving the formation and the surface diffusion of cobalt nanoclusters can explain the influence of electrodeposition parameters on the morphology of the cobalt nanostructures.

40|$|A {{hydrometallurgical process}} has been {{developed}} for cobalt recovery from a waste catalyst (petroleum refining Indus- try). This waste catalyst containing about 2. 18 weight % of Co, is highly contaminated by Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mo. The major steps are: 1) The spent catalyst is roasted with flux material in an electrical furnace at very high temperature (700 °C) for a specific duration; 2) The roasted sample is leached with sulphuric acid to bring the metal con- tents into solution form; 3) For separating cobalt values from the leach solution, the solution pH is raised by NaOH ad- dition, where all cobalt content is precipitated at a pH of about 12; 4) This cobalt hydroxide precipitate is filtered and dissolved in minimum amount of sulphuric acid to get <b>cobalt</b> <b>sulphate</b> solution which is used as the electrolyte for the electrolytic recovery of cobalt. For optimizing various parameters like 1) H 2 SO 4 concentration; 2) Duration; 3) Cobalt concentration; 4) Current density; 5) Temperature; 6) Stirring etc. The particle surface morphology and deposited lay- ers have been characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

30|$|Due to the {{presence}} of sucrose in the vase solution, which is considered as an unfavorable condition and is associated with many problems, microbial growth occurs (Rodney and Hill 1993). The moisture enters the stem through the cut and exposed sides of the spikes and leads to blockage of the vascular bundles, thus creating an imbalance between water uptake and water loss. They also release secondary metabolites like enzymes or ethylene which are toxic and thus decrease the longevity of the cut spikes. So, addition of an antimicrobial element in sugar solution is essential to prevent the vascular blockage and enhance the vase life. Different chemicals, i.e. silver nitrate, aluminum sulphate, <b>cobalt</b> <b>sulphate,</b> 8 -hydroxyquinoline sulphate in different combinations and proportions (Reddy et al. 1997), 5 -Sulfo Salicylic Acid (5 -SSA) (Ezhilmathi et al. 2007), boric acid, citric acid, and α-lipoic acid (Singh 2005), are used in different formulations and combinations to enhance the vase life of cut flowers. Selection of appropriate vase solution or preservative is necessary to extend the vase life and floral quality by studying physiological and biochemical processes of floral senescence.|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{satisfactory}} short-term implant survivorship of metal-on-metal hip resurfacing arthroplasty, periprosthetic soft-tissue masses such as pseudotumours {{are being}} increasingly reported. Cytotoxic effects of cobalt or chromium {{have been suggested}} {{to play a role}} in its aetiology. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of clinically relevant metal nanoparticles and ions on the viability of macrophages in vitro. A RAW 264. 7 murine macrophage cell line was cultured in the presence of either: (1) cobalt, chromium and titanium nanoparticles sized 30 - 35 nm; or (2) <b>cobalt</b> <b>sulphate</b> and chromium chloride. Two methods were used to quantify cell viability: Alamar Blue assay and Live/Dead assay. The cytotoxicity was observed only with cobalt. Cobalt nanoparticles and ions demonstrated dose-dependent cytotoxic effects on macrophages in vitro: the cytotoxic concentrations of nanoparticles and ions were 1 x 10 (12) particles ml(- 1) and 1000 microM, respectively. The high concentration of cobalt nanoparticles required for cytotoxicity of macrophages in vitro suggests that increased production of cobalt nanoparticles in vivo, due to excessive MoM implant wear, may lead to local adverse biological effects. Therefore, cytotoxicity of high concentrations of metal nanoparticles phagocytosed by macrophages located in the periprosthetic tissues may be an important factor in pathogenesis of pseudotumours...|$|E
