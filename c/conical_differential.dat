40|$|Numerical MHD {{simulations}} play {{increasingly important}} role for understanding mechanisms of stellar magnetism. We present simulations of convection and dynamos in density-stratified rotating spherical fluid shells. We employ a new 3 D simulation code for {{the solution of}} a physically consistent anelastic model of the process with a minimum number of parameters. The reported dynamo simulations extend into a "buoyancy-dominated" regime where the buoyancy forcing is dominant while the Coriolis force is no longer balanced by pressure gradients and strong anti-solar differential rotation develops as a result. We find that the self-generated magnetic fields, despite being relatively weak, are able to reverse the direction of differential rotation from anti-solar to solar-like. We also find that convection flows in this regime are significantly stronger in the polar regions than in the equatorial region, leading to non-oscillatory dipole-dominated dynamo solutions, and to concentration of magnetic field in the polar regions. We observe that convection has different morphology in the inner and at the outer part of the convection zone simultaneously such that organized geostrophic convection columns are hidden below a near-surface layer of well-mixed highly-chaotic convection. While we focus the attention on the buoyancy-dominated regime, we also demonstrate that <b>conical</b> <b>differential</b> rotation profiles and persistent regular dynamo oscillations can be obtained in the parameter space of the rotation-dominated regime even within this minimal model.

40|$|International audienceThe global {{dynamics}} of a rotating star like the Sun involves the coupling {{of a highly}} turbulent convective envelope overlying a seemingly benign radiative interior. We use the anelastic spherical harmonic code {{to develop a new}} class of three-dimensional models that nonlinearly couple the convective envelope to a deep stable radiative interior. The numerical simulation assumes a realistic solar stratification from r = 0. 07 up to 0. 97 R (with R the solar radius), thus encompassing part of the nuclear core up through most of the convection zone. We find that a tachocline naturally establishes itself between the differentially rotating convective envelope and the solid body rotation of the interior, with a slow spreading that is here diffusively controlled. The rapid angular momentum redistribution in the convective envelope leads to a fast equator and slow poles, with a <b>conical</b> <b>differential</b> rotation achieved at mid-latitudes, much as has been deduced by helioseismology. The convective motions are able to overshoot downward about 0. 04 R into the radiative interior. However, the convective meridional circulation there is confined to a smaller penetration depth and is directed mostly equatorward {{at the base of the}} convection zone. Thermal wind balance is established in the lower convection zone and tachocline but departures are evident in the upper convection zone. Internal gravity waves are excited by the convective overshooting, yielding a complex wave field throughout the radiative interior...|$|E
40|$|The dual {{function}} of a surge tank is to reduce water-hammer waves in power station piping systems and {{to act as a}} rate-of-flow equalizer, from which immediate water or storage requirements following turbine load changes can be met. Design requirements are based on predictions of surging in the tank. Experimental performance figures from model and full-scale tanks are compared with various theoretical methods. Experimental investigations include comparison between the simple, widened, <b>conical,</b> throttled, <b>differential</b> and twin-type tanks, showing their uses and respective advantages. The effects of modifications of design are also examined. Finally, experimental results are presented which show the variation of water-hammer pressures with the different types of tank and system arrangement...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} flow {{characteristics}} of low-speed fluid in a micro-channel, a model including the silk gland middle section, transition section, and forepart of a silkworm silk gland was established. The flow characteristics of silk solution therein were studied, {{and under the}} same average velocity, the flow characteristics of water were investigated for comparison {{with those of the}} silk solution. Results show that under the same average velocity, the axial velocity of the water was lower than that of the silk solution; the resistance coefficient change is the same, the resistance coefficient (both in the middle section and forepart) is constant, and in the conical channel, the resistance coefficient decreases linearly. At different average velocities, the variation of the water-related parameters was consistent; the <b>conical</b> channel <b>differential</b> pressure accounted for about 1. 14 % of the full differential pressure, and the straight channel pressure difference was 98. 6 %. With increasing outlet velocity, the shear layer of the silk solution gradually thinned, and the frictional pressure gradient decreased while the flow resistance also decreased. Later the flow characteristics of water and protein in the conical channel were studied and the changing relationship of the resistance coefficient and Reynolds number was analyzed. Finally, experimental research was undertaken on a micro-channel: the data were compared to simulated values, and the error was within 6 %...|$|R
40|$|AA 2219 Al–Cu alloy {{is widely}} used in defence and {{aerospace}} applications due to required combination of high strength-to-weight ratio and toughness. Fabrication of components used for defence always involves welding. Even though the mechanical properties of the base metal are better, but the alloy suffers from poor mechanical and corrosion properties during fusion welding. To overcome the problems of fusion welding, friction stir welding (FSW) is recognized as an alternative solid state joining method aimed to improve the mechanical and corrosion properties. Tool profile {{is one of the}} important variables which affect the performance of the friction stir weld. In the present work the effect of tool profile on the microstructure and pitting corrosion of AA 2219 aluminium–copper alloy was studied. Electron backscattered diffraction results established that the grain size and orientation of weld nugget of triangle profile is finer than that of <b>conical</b> profile. <b>Differential</b> scanning calorimetric results show the evidence of precipitate dissolution during FSW. It was found that the microstructure changes, such as grain size and its orientation precipitate dissolution during FSW influence the hardness and corrosion behaviour. Pitting corrosion resistance of friction stir welds of AA 2219 was found to be better for triangle profile tool compared to conical profile which is attributed to material flow and strengthening precipitate morphology in various zones. Higher amount of heat generation during FSW made using triangle profile tool may be the reason for greater dissolution of strengthening precipitates in nugget zone and coarsening in thermo mechanically affected zone (TMAZ) and heat affected zone (HAZ) ...|$|R
50|$|The RX-8 was {{designed}} as a front mid-engine, rear-wheel drive four-door, four-seater quad coupe. The car has near 50:50 front-rear weight distribution and a low polar moment of inertia, achieved by mounting the engine behind the front axle and the fuel tank ahead of the rear axle. The front suspension uses double wishbones and the rear is multi-link. Weight is trimmed through the use of materials such as aluminium and plastic for several body panels. The rest of the body is steel, except for the plastic front and rear bumpers. The manual gearbox model uses a carbon fiber composite driveshaft to reduce the rotational mass (momentum of inertia) connected to the engine. At the heart of the Mazda RX-8 is its high-revving, 1.3-liter rotary engine.http://www.edmunds.com/mazda/rx-8/ Power is sent to the rear wheels through a torque-sensing <b>conical</b> limited slip <b>differential</b> for improved handling. While underpowered in comparison to the final RX-7, the RX-8 is considered its successor as Mazda's rotary engine sports sedan. Its layout and clever engineering, along with typical Mazda suspension tuning have endowed it with excellent driving dynamics which have garnered much praise and numerous awards. It has also proved popular in Japan among car enthusiasts as well as aftermarket equipment manufacturers and professional tuners.|$|R
40|$|The {{nature of}} the nematic-nematic phase {{transition}} in the liquid crystal dimer 1 '', 9 ''-bis(4 -cyanobiphenyl- 4 '-yl) nonane (CB 9 CB) has been investigated using techniques of calorimetry, dynamic dielectric response measurements, and H- 2 NMR spectroscopy. The experimental results for CB 9 CB show that, like the shorter homologue CB 7 CB, the studied material exhibits a normal nematic phase, which on cooling undergoes a transition to the twist-bend nematic phase (N-TB), a uniaxial nematic phase, promoted by the average bent molecular shape, in which the director tilts and precesses describing a <b>conical</b> helix.

Analysis of the dynamic dielectric response in both nematic phases has provided an estimate of the conical angle of the heliconical structure for the N-TB phase. Capacitance measurements of the electric-field realignment of the director in initially planar aligned cells have yielded values for the splay and bend elastic constants in the high temperature nematic phase.
