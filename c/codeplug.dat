5000|$|On each {{phone the}} MOTO Talk entry varies between 'MotoTalk' and 'DirecTalk' {{depending}} on {{the age of the}} phone and the branded carrier (Boost Mobile or Nextel). Otherwise, they are the identical function with a different name. Boost Mobile phones are not enabled for MOTO Talk use by default but can enabled by modifying the <b>codeplug</b> of the device (The Motorola i415 has the <b>codeplug</b> entry but not the needed transceiver hardware. As of 2011, it is the only device from Boost on the iDEN network that cannot use MOTO Talk.) ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{my opinion}} (AaronASB), the best iDEN radios with DirectTalk/MotoTalk (DTMT) feature are the phone models {{that allow you}} to connect and screw in a higher gain antenna such as the i365, {{additionally}} the i365 has <b>codeplug</b> options to automatically load the DTMT app and if exited accidently, it will run the app, keeping a non-technically inclined user in the app.|$|E
40|$|This {{version of}} the Radio Service Software (RSS) {{incorporates}} changes made to the GTX radio <b>codeplug</b> with regard to additions to the GTX radio “Basic ” model family. These changes are not backward compatible with previous versions of the GTX RSS. This {{version of the}} RSS will properly read all current <b>codeplug</b> archive files and radio codeplugs. However, codeplugs that are written with this version will not be readable by prior RSS versions. The changes are transparent to the radio’s firmware. Therefore, the changes are compatible with all current/ prior radio firmware versions. Use caution if you are distributing this version among several service locations {{to ensure that all}} locations begin use of this version at the same time. COMPUTER SOFTWARE COPYRIGHT...|$|E
5000|$|The {{audible alarm}} on the Minitor lasts {{only for the}} {{duration}} of the second activation tone. If there is bad reception, the pager may only sound a quick beep, and the user may not be alerted properly. This can be changed by editing the <b>codeplug's</b> [...] "Alert Duration" [...] from STD to Fixed, the user can then set the alert duration longer than the second tone. The user must be cautious, however, as setting the alert tone duration too high may cover some voice information. Also, some units may have the volume knob set to control the sound output of the audible alert as well. The user may have the volume turned down to an undetectable level either by accident or by carelessness, thus missing the page. A factory option for [...] "Fixed Alert" [...] (the only option on the earlier Minitor I), however, lets the alert tone override the volume and sound at maximum volume regardless of the volume knob's position. It is possible to program the pager to always vibrate when an alert is received, giving the possibility of either a silent (vibrating) alert or audible and vibrating alerts. Minitor I and II do not have vibrating capabilities standard).|$|R

To perform the alignment procedures, the radio must {{be connected to the}} PC, RIB (Radio Interface Box), and Test Set as shown inFigure 7 - 1. All SERVICE screens read and program the radio <b>codeplug</b> directly; you do NOT have to use the RSS GET/SAVE functions to program new tuning values. CAUTION Do NOT switch radios in the middle of any SERVICE procedure. Always use the EXIT key to return to the MAIN menu screen before disconnecting the radio. Improper exits from the SERVICE screens may leave the radio in an improperly configured state and result in seriously degraded radio or system performance. The SERVICE screens use the concept of the “Softpot”, an analog SOFTware controlled POTentiometer used for adjusting all transceiver alignment controls. Each SERVICE screen provides the capability to increase or decrease the ‘softpot ’ value with th...|$|E
