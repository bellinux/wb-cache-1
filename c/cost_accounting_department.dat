40|$|Following {{the lifting}} of the {{sanctions}} imposed on Libya by the UN in 2003, the need for developing cost allocation systems has become necessary. This includes aspects such as privatization, foreign industries, and competition. All these factors should be considered by the cost and management accounting practitioners of the Libyan industrial sector. Based on the findings of a questionnaire survey, supported by semi-structured interviews, this study has examined the state of cost allocation (CA) systems in terms of product costs of large and medium Libyan manufacturing companies (LMLMCs). A contingency theory approach is adopted and a frame-work is developed in order to investigate the accuracy of the product costs. The study revealed {{that the majority of the}} LMLMCs are influenced by the financial accounting mentality. Almost all of them are using simplistic traditional CA methods. A few of them have already contracted to develop (up-date or redesign) their CA system. In fact, almost all of them calculate inaccurate product costs when companies produce various products. The full cost-plus pricing method is rejected by almost all the surveyed companies that face high levels of competition. Instead, they traced the mechanism of market price or comparing product cost with the prevailing market prices. On the other hand, almost all the public companies are facing very low competition which enabled them to adopt the cost-plus pricing method. In contrast, almost all privately-owned companies are facing very high or high levels of competition. In terms of preparing cost information on time, some the LMLMCs do not prepare overhead budgets. Most of them prepare cost information annually and the majorities are preparing cost information in irregular periods. According to the important factors that influence the accuracy of product costs, it was found a strong negative relationship with the level of product diversity and accuracy, a strong negative relationship between the level of intensity of competition and the level of use of cost-plus pricing and a strong negative relationship between the level of ownership and the level of use of the cost-plus pricing method. Finally, the factors that constrict the CA development are as follows; absence of any internal leadership; lack of specialist managerial accountants; lack of top management support; lack of active training programs; centralization of decision-making; it is extremely expensive to develop the CA systems; absence of professional cost or managerial accounting bodies in Libya. With regards to the organization's size factor, lack of financial ability; lack of an independent <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>department</b> are important. In relation to the organization's ownership factor, it was found only the low level of competition is important. While most previous studies focused on the implementation of ABC in Western developed countries, this study has contributed further evidence to the value of studying CA systems in terms of product costs with a managerial emphasis in the Libyan context. In addition, this research describes the degree of accuracy and preparing cost information on time. However, it determined contingency factors that restrict the cost allocation system development and influenced the accuracy of product costs in the LMLMCs...|$|E

Previous to this position at the Ordnance Department, he was chief of the Division of <b>Cost</b> <b>Accounting</b> of the <b>Department</b> of Commerce. The filling of these positions gave him ample opportunity to become familiar with the war contract situation in its accounting aspects.

40|$|Objective – This article {{provides}} an overview of how university libraries research and adapt new <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> models, such as “activity-based costing” (ABC) and “time-driven activity-based costing” (TDABC), focusing on {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} both methods to determine which of these two is suitable for application in university libraries. Methods – This paper reviews and summarizes the literature on <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> and <b>costing</b> practices of university libraries. A brief overview of the history of <b>cost</b> <b>accounting,</b> <b>costing,</b> and time and motion studies in libraries is also provided. The ABC and the TDABC method, designed as a revised and easier version of the ABC by Kaplan and Anderson (Kaplan & Anderson 2004) at the beginning of the 21 st century, as well as the adoption and adaptation of these methods by university libraries are described, and their strengths and weaknesses, as well as their suitability for university libraries, are analyzed. Results – <b>Cost</b> <b>accounting</b> and <b>costing</b> studies in libraries have a long history, the first of these dating back to 1877. The development of <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> and time and motion studies can be seen as a natural evolution of techniques which were created to solve management problems. The ABC method is the best-known management accounting innovation of the last 20 years, and is already widely used in university libraries around the world. However, setting up an ABC system can be very costly, and the system needs to be regularly updated, which further increases its costs. The TDABC system can not only be implemented more quickly (and thus more cheaply), but also can be updated more easily than the traditional ABC, which makes the TDABC the more suitable method for university libraries. Conclusion – Both methods are suitable for university libraries. However, the ABC method can only be implemented in collaboration with an <b>accounting</b> <b>department.</b> The TDABC method can be tested and implemented by separate departments, and thus can contribute to the provision of better and more effective library services at lower costs.
