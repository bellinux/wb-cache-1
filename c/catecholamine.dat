50|$|There is also enzymatic {{degradation}} of the <b>catecholamines</b> by two main enzymes - monoamine oxidase and catechol-o-methyl transferase. Respectively, these enzymes oxidise monoamines (including <b>catecholamines)</b> and methylate the hydroxal groups of the phenyl moiety of <b>catecholamines.</b> These enzymes can be targeted pharmacologically.

40|$|Age, sex, {{hypertension}} and dietary sodium are proposed to affect plasma and urinary <b>catecholamines.</b> Yet no prior study {{has examined the}} simultaneous effects of these factors within the same study population, so results may have been confounded by factors not determined. We investigate, for the first time, the impact of simultaneously determined predictors of plasma and urinary <b>catecholamines,</b> {{and the relationship of}} <b>catecholamines</b> with the diagnosis of hypertension. Hypertensive and normotensive subjects (n= 308) were studied off antihypertensives in liberal and low sodium balance. Twenty-four hour urinary <b>catecholamines</b> (norepinephrine and epinephrine) were measured. Plasma <b>catecholamines</b> were measured supine after overnight fast. Repeated measures multivariate linear regression models examined effect of sex, race, age, body mass index, dietary salt (liberal salt vs. low salt), hypertension status, and mean arterial pressure on plasma and urinary <b>catecholamines.</b> Logistic regression determined the relationship of <b>catecholamines</b> with diagnosis of hypertension. Dietary sodium restriction and increasing age predicted increased plasma and urinary norepinephrine, with sodium restriction having greatest effect. Female sex predicted lower urinary and plasma epinephrine. Neither plasma nor urinary <b>catecholamines</b> predicted the diagnosis of hypertension.

5|$|Catecholamines are {{produced}} in chromaffin {{cells in the}} medulla of the adrenal gland, from tyrosine, a non-essential amino acid derived from food or produced from phenylalanine in the liver. The enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase converts tyrosine to L-DOPA in {{the first step of}} <b>catecholamine</b> synthesis. L-DOPA is then converted to dopamine before it can be turned into noradrenaline. In the cytosol, noradrenaline is converted to epinephrine by the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and stored in granules. Glucocorticoids produced in the adrenal cortex stimulate the synthesis of catecholamines by increasing the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and PNMT.|$|E

40|$|Comparative studies {{reveal that}} the {{ethylenediamine}} and the trihydroxyindole method when employed as suggested are suitable for assessing sympatho-adrenal activation under various stressful conditions that are accompanied by release of <b>catecholamines</b> into the circulation.

Use of sodium thiosulfate in the ethylenediamine procedure minimizes association of <b>catecholamines</b> with formed elements. If blood samples are cooled in ice water when collected, association of <b>catecholamines</b> with blood cells can be further reduced.

40|$|Adrenal hormones {{were studied}} as {{possible}} triggering substances of {{the synthesis of}} acute-phase reactants in rats. alpha-Macrofoetoprotein, which rises sharply in concentration during inflammation, was used to monitor the acute-phase reaction. In normal rats glucocorticoids and <b>catecholamines</b> induce alpha-macrofoetoprotein synthesis; glucocorticoids only increase alpha-macrofoetoprotein to moderate levels in plasma, but <b>catecholamines</b> enhance alpha-macrofoetoprotein synthesis to very high levels, comparable with those observed in the post-injury phase. However, <b>catecholamines</b> in vivo also activate the adrenal cortex, suggesting a synergistic effect of both kinds of adrenal hormones. Our study showed that in adrenalectomized rats, the effect of <b>catecholamines</b> on alpha-macrofoetoprotein synthesis is greatly diminished, whereas the moderate effect of glucocorticoids remains. Combination of glucocorticoids and <b>catecholamines</b> induces extremely high alpha-macrofoetoprotein levels in both adrenalectomized and normal rats.

Areas of depigmentation with loss of melanocyte photoactivity are associated with areas of anaesthaesia (Vemuri et al. 1995; Singh et al. 1983 a).

40|$|It is {{becoming}} increasingly clear that the autonomic nervous system and the immune system demonstrate cross-talk during inflammation by means of sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways(1, 2).

40|$|Introduction <b>Catecholamines</b> are {{chemical}} compounds which {{play an important}} role as neurotransmitters in many vital functions of the organism. The paper presents a short survey of their biosynthesis, disintegration and functions, with respect to the neuroanatomical location of cell groups which contain these compounds. <b>Catecholamines</b> in the human hypothalamus Because the authors were most interested in the behavior of <b>catecholamines</b> in the diencephalon, particularly in the hypothalamus, they focused their attention on cells secreting <b>catecholamines</b> (dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, octopamine). The paper also deals with the connections between cellular structures which emit and receive the neuronal impulses that transport <b>catecholamines</b> as neurotransmitters. These include the following dopaminergic systems: nigrostriatal, tuberohypophysial, retinal, periventricular, periglomerular and dopaminergic systems in mesolimbic, mesocortical and diencephalic regions.

25|$|Before the {{discovery}} of TAAR1, trace amines were believed to serve very limited functions.

The most common way to diagnose the tumor is measurement of the biochemical markers; <b>catecholamines</b> and their metabolites, methylated <b>catecholamines.</b> After observation that almost all normetanephrine results for women were higher than the upper reference limit and therefore pathological, the accuracy of the present reference intervals was questioned.

40|$|<b>Catecholamines</b> are host {{stress hormones}} that can induce {{the growth of}} many {{bacteria}} by facilitating iron utilization and/or regulate the expression of virulence genes through specific hormone receptors.
