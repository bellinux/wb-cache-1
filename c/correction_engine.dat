Earlier tests on automotive engines, made under sea-level conditions, showed that water vapor acts as an inert diluent, reducing engine power in proportion to the amount of vapor present. By combining the effects of atmospheric pressure, temperature, and humidity, it is shown that the indicated power obtainable from an engine is proportional to its mass rate of consumption of oxygen.

50|$|The {{original}} Soyuz had a separated orbital correction system (KTDU-35) {{from its}} orientation system. The latter, integrated a reaction control system called DPO and the attitude control system, called DO. The KTDU-35 had a main orbit <b>correction</b> <b>engine</b> SKD, the S5.60 and a backup orbital <b>correction</b> <b>engine</b> DKD, the S5.35. These two were gas generator engines burning UDMH and AK27I. The DPO and DO thrusters, {{on the other}} hand, were monopropellant pressure fed rockets that used catalytic decomposition of H2O2 to generate thrust. Having such dissimilar systems with different cycles, propellant, and feed systems added failure modes and required heavy backup equipment, like the backup de-orbit engine, the S5.35.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the changes}} made for Ranger 7 {{included}} new procedures to apply full power testing to the spacecraft {{off of the}} launch pad, {{where there was no}} risk of the midcourse <b>correction</b> <b>engine</b> activating on top of a fully fueled Atlas-Agena.|$|E
50|$|The {{full report}} as {{submitted}} to U.S. Congress came under criticism from several people at NASA, noting that, although the cameras lacked redundancy, {{any one of}} dozens of failure modes in the booster or spacecraft could also result in failure to return any TV images. In regards to the lack of adequate prelaunch testing, they brought up the incident back in 1961 with Ranger 1 deploying its solar panels during a ground test and that ground tests with full 60 W power had been discontinued on the Block II probes for fear of accidentally igniting the midcourse <b>correction</b> <b>engine</b> on the pad and destroying the entire launch vehicle in the process.|$|E

50|$|For {{this version}} of the KTDU, they used the {{pressure}} fed cycle for all rocket engines, and consolidated propellants on the UDMH/N2O4 combination, which gives superior density and specific impulse and can be stored for years in space. For the orbital <b>correction</b> <b>engine</b> (SKD), they developed the 11D426. That while less powerful than the S5.60 (3.09 kN versus 4.09 kN), it improved efficiency with a specific impulse of 292 seconds (the S5.60 had 278s). Also, the switch to pressure fed cycle eliminated the use of turbopumps and its associated cost and reliability issues. And it also enabled the reduction in minimum burn time and engine transients since there was no turbine start up and shut down hysteresis.|$|E
50|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{was of the}} Ranger Block I {{design and}} consisted of a hexagonal base 1.5 m across upon which was mounted a cone-shaped 4-meter-high tower of aluminum struts and braces. Two solar panel wings measuring 5.2 m from tip to tip extended from the base. A high-gain directional dish antenna {{was attached to the}} bottom of the base. Spacecraft experiments and other equipment were mounted on the base and tower. Instruments aboard the spacecraft included a Lyman-alpha telescope, a rubidium-vapor magnetometer, electrostatic analyzers, medium-energy range particle detectors, two triple coincidence telescopes, a cosmic-ray integrating ionization chamber, cosmic dust detectors, and solar X-ray scintillation counters.

40|$|We present {{research}} aiming to build tools for the normalization of User-Generated Content (UGC). We argue that processing {{this type of}} text requires the revisiting of the initial steps of Natural Language Processing, since UGC (micro-blog, blog, and, generally, Web 2. 0 user-generated texts) presents a number of nonstandard communicative and linguistic characteristics – often closer to oral and colloquial language than to edited text. We present a corpus of UGC text in Spanish from three different sources: Twitter, consumer reviews, and blogs, and describe its main characteristics. We motivate the need for UGC text normalization by analyzing the problems found when processing this type of text through a conventional language processing pipeline, particularly in the tasks of lemmatization and morphosyntactic tagging. Our aim with {{this paper is to}} seize the power of already existing spell and grammar <b>correction</b> <b>engines</b> and endow them with automatic normalization capabilities in order {{to pave the way for}} the application of standard Natural Language Processing tools to typical UGC text. Particularly, we propose a strategy for automatically normalizing UGC by adding a module on top of a pre-existing spell-checker that selects the most plausible correction from an unranked list of candidates provided by the spell-checker. To build this selector module we train four language models, each one containing a different type of linguistic information in a trade-off with its generalization capabilities. Our experiments show that the models trained on truecase and lowercase word forms are more discriminative than the others at selecting the best candidate. We have also experimented with a parametrized combination of the models by both optimizing directly on the selection task and doing a linear interpolation of the models. The resulting parametrized combinations obtain results close to the best performing model but do not improve on those results, as measured on the test set. The precision of the selector module in ranking number one the expected correction proposal on the test corpora reaches 82. 5 % for Twitter text (baseline 57 %) and 88 % for non-Twitter text (baseline 64 %).

40|$|New {{concept for}} {{reducing}} dose radiation exposure, which helps {{to decrease the}} duration and cost of deep space human missions is introduced. This concept can be efficiently realized, using modern materials, such as carbon nanotube composites. The dream of a flying reactor, which takes advantage of a nuclear power to bring humans to other planets, has been around the corner for many years [1]. To develop such a spacecraft, NASA and other space agencies have established number of projects such as NERVA [2], Project Prometheus [3], etc. However they were closed due to serious budget and technical problems. One of the main problems is to shield the crew from the radiation of the onboard reac-tor. Traditional shielding was so thick and heavy that it would significantly complicate liftoff [1]. The current NASA Advanced Exploration System project with Nuclear Cryo-genic Propulsion Stage (NCPS) [4] has same challenge. At present, the mass of required traditional shielding exceeds 7 tones [5]. However this problem can be easily solved by making a spacecraft from two separate modules: nuclear booster and manned module, which are connected to each other by a long rope (several ropes for safety reasons) with length of order 1 km, as shown in Fig. 1, where α is the small angle between the rope line and the directions of jetstreams. Both modules should {{have a number of}} small orbit <b>correction</b> <b>engines</b> for making mutual maneuvers. The required rope(s) can be made of modern developing materials, such as carbon nanotube (CNT) composites, to reduce the mass of the spacecraft. A novel-processing approach to production of CNTs that can be easily scaled up for industrial production, was recently introduced in Ref. [6]. In particular, the CNTs were stretched by pulling onto the rotating spool, which improves the tensile strength of the CNT composite ribbon by approximately 90 percent (to an average of 3. 5 gigapascals). The density of this stretch-wound composite is only 1. 25 g·cm− 3. Hence the mass of ropes is vanishing comparing to the rest of mass of the spacecraft. Usage of a nuclear engine without a heavy traditional shielding will significantly decrease the time of a spaceflight to Mars and other destinations, as well as the dose radiation exposure from cosmic rays.

50|$|Mariner 3 was {{launched}} at 2:22 PM EST on November 5, 1964 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 13. After an uneventful boost phase, the Agena completed it's burn {{to place the}} probe on a trajectory towards Mars. One hour after launch, the first telemetry transmissions from Mariner 3 were received, indicating that the scientific instruments were functioning correctly {{but there was no}} indication of any solar panel operation. Unsure of the exact problem, ground controllers issued a command to turn off the rate gyros to conserve power while they worked to figure out what had happened. Telemetry data suggested a separation failure of either the Agena or the payload fairing, however a below-normal velocity appeared to indicate that the fairing had not separated properly. A command was sent to manually jettison the payload shroud, but nothing happened. The ground controllers next considered firing Mariner 3's midcourse <b>correction</b> <b>engine</b> to blow off the shroud, however they ran out of time. Eight hours after launch, the batteries in the probe died and the mission was officially terminated. Even if the shroud could be removed, the mission probably would have failed anyway since the low velocity meant that Mariner 3 would miss Mars by several million miles.|$|E
50|$|The {{successful}} {{launch of}} Mariner 2 on August 22 momentarily blunted criticism of NASA and Jet Propulsion Laboratory and {{also seemed to}} verify the soundness of the Ranger design. Meanwhile, JPL engineers were {{still trying to figure}} out what had caused the computer failure on Ranger 4, which had occurred during a period when the probe was out of range of ground tracking. The malfunction was especially puzzling because the probe had been given very thorough ground testing without any anomalies occurring. Examination of telemetry records seemed to suggest that the failure had occurred during separation of Ranger 4 from the Agena, at the point where the electrical interface between the two was disconnected and Ranger 4 would have switched to internal power. The behavior of the probe indicated a transformer or inverter malfunction, probably a short circuit caused by loose metal coatings contacting the pins on the power umbilical attaching the probe to the Agena. Modifications to Ranger 5 included a backup timer to ensure continued operation of the telemetry system if the main computer failed, an additional nitrogen bottle to the attitude control system to reduce gas pressure, and an additional pyrotechnic igniter for the midcourse <b>correction</b> <b>engine.</b> Most importantly, extra diodes and fuses were added to the electrical lines to prevent another short from occurring.|$|E
50|$|Elation {{turned to}} dismay once again when high {{temperatures}} were {{detected in the}} computer system; shortly afterwards, power generation from the solar panels ceased. The gamma ray detector was turned on, but the computer did not issue the command to align the spacecraft with Earth. Even worse, the telemetry receivers at the tracking stations in Australia and South Africa malfunctioned, returning garbled data. It was obvious that an electrical short had disabled the solar panels, which meant that Ranger 5 now {{had only a few}} hours before it would run out of battery power. JPL technicians held out hope that they could still partially salvage the mission by firing the midcourse <b>correction</b> <b>engine</b> to ensure impact with the Moon, but they had to do it quickly before power ran out. Ground controllers sent commands to unfurl the high-gain antenna and align the probe for the midcourse burn, but during this time more electrical shorts apparently occurred because there was a momentary dropout from the telemetry transmitter. The midcourse engine was fired, but Ranger 5 exhausted its batteries halfway through the burn. The radio transponder and telemetry signals ceased, followed by uncontrolled tumbling of the probe. Ranger 5 passed 450 miles from the lunar surface en route to a permanent orbit around the Sun. Signals were still received from the tiny seismometer capsule until fading as the probe's distance from Earth became too great.Mission controllers tracked it to a distance of 1.3 million km (808,000) miles.|$|E

Summary This application note covers the design considerations of a Video Over IP networks system using the performance features of the LogiCORE ™ IP SMPTE 2022 - 5 / 6 Video Over IP transmitter and receiver cores. The design focuses on high bit rate, native media transport over 10 Gb/s Ethernet with a built-in forward error <b>correction</b> (FEC) <b>engine</b> and seamless protection switching. The design is able to support up to three SD/HD/ 3 G-SDI streams. The reference design has two platforms: the transmitter platform and the receiver platform. The transmitter platform design uses three SMPTE SDI cores to receive the incoming SDI video streams. The received SDI streams are multiplexed and encapsulated into fixed-size datagrams by the SMPTE 2022 - 5 / 6 Video Over IP transmitter core and sent out through two 10 -Gigabit Ethernet MAC cores. The 10 gigabit link is supported by two 10 -Gigabit Ethernet PCS/PMA cores using an optical cable connected to the receiver end. On the receiver platform, the Ethernet datagrams are collected at the 10 -Gigabit Ethernet MAC. The SMPTE 2022 - 5 / 6 Video Over IP receiver core filters the datagrams, de-encapsulates and de-multiplexes the datagrams into individual streams which are output through the SMPTE SDI cores. The Ethernet datagrams are buffered in DDR 3 SDRAM for both the transmitter and receiver. The DDR traffic passes through the AXI 4 interconnect to the 7 series AXI memory controller.

40|$|Nozzle {{guide vane}} (NGV) flow {{capacity}} {{is perhaps the}} most important parameter for engine optimization. Inaccurate evaluation of capacity would lead to incorrect performance evaluation, and unmatched stages. A new semi-transient technique has been developed and demonstrated that will allow turbine designers to measure experimentally the effective throat area of an annular cascade of nozzle guide vanes at engine-representative Mach number, Reynolds number, and mainstream-to-cooling-flow pressure ratio. The technique allows NGV capacity to be measured to bias and precision uncertainties to 95 % confidence of ± 0. 546 % and ± 0. 028 %, which compares well to large scale industrial facilities. Order-of-magnitude cost savings are offered over typical continuously running industrial facilities by running in blowdown mode from a receiver tank, thus removing the need for large scale compressor plant. To demonstrate the technique, a high mass flow rate blowdown tunnel was developed and commissioned at the University of Oxford, and the capacity of a high-pressure NGV from a large civil aircraft engine was experimentally determined. Experimental results are presented, which allow the precision error to be accurately calculated. A detailed uncertainty analysis is given from which the bias error is computed. It is shown that the low precision error the new technique offers means that it is ideally suited to investigations in which secondary influences on capacity are the subject of the investigation. The technique is of industrial significance because methods to compute engine capacity analytically or computationally do not yet provide sufficient accuracy for engine optimization, and the new technique offers equivalent accuracy at a much reduced cost over conventional experimental techniques. By performing an uncertainty analysis using experimental data it is shown that the increase in uncertainty due to the semi-transient (as opposed to steady state) nature of the technique is approximately 0. 004 % (to 95 % confidence), and is entirely negligible. The experimentally measured trend of capacity against pressure ratio is compared with simple 1 D, 2 D, and 3 D inviscid models, and an analytical correction for total pressure loss is performed. It is shown that while a simple 3 D model is better than a 1 D model (up to 1. 5 % improvement) for crude estimates of engine capacity, experimental trends are poorly predicted by such simple techniques. An analytical correction for total pressure loss increases the difference between 3 D prediction and experiment. The experimental data demonstrate the complex nature of the process by which nozzle capacity is determined and the need for accurate, low-cost experimental techniques for capacity measurement. <b>Correction</b> to <b>engine</b> conditions is discussed. © 2011 American Society of Mechanical Engineers...|$|R
5000|$|Early in {{the morning}} of January 31, the command was sent to fire the midcourse <b>correction</b> <b>engine,</b> which {{performed}} flawlessly and set the probe on an impact course with the Sea of Tranquility. On February 2, JPL technicians prepared for the final phase of the mission. Ranger 6 began its descent and trajectory calculations determined that impact would occur close to the intended area. With the probe's angle suitable for taking images, the order was given to turn on the camera with 13 minutes and 10 seconds until impact. After an initial warm-up phase, the command to power them on was sent. However, no imagery or any sign of camera operation appeared. Two more commands were sent to turn on the camera, but still nothing happened even though all other systems continued to operate normally. At 1:24 AM, impact with the Moon occurred and telemetry transmission from Ranger 6 ceased. The mission was over and for the 12th time in a row, a U.S. attempt to send a probe to the Moon had malfunctioned. Even worse, it had occurred one week before NASA officials were planning to announce to Congress their projected US$5.3 billion budget for fiscal year 1965, a good deal of it related to manned and unmanned lunar missions.

This is a phased approach that consists of an upgrade to the current Space Shuttle Main Engine Controller (SSMEC) to add turbomachinery synchronous vibration protection and addition of a separate Health Management Computer (HMC) that will utilize advanced algorithms to detect and mitigate predefined engine anomalies. The purpose of the Shuttle AHMS is twofold; one {{is to increase the}} probability of successfully placing the Orbiter into the intended orbit, and the other is to increase the probability of being able to safely execute an abort of a Space Transportation System (STS) launch. Both objectives are achieved by increasing the useful work envelope of a Space Shuttle Main Engine after it has developed anomalous performance during launch and the ascent phase of the mission. This increase in work envelope will be the result of two new anomaly mitigation options, in addition to existing engine shutdown, that were previously unavailable. The added anomaly mitigation options include engine throttle-down and performance <b>correction</b> (adjustment of <b>engine</b> oxidizer to fuel ratio), as well as enhanced sensor disqualification capability.

40|$|Thermal engine {{encapsulation}} is {{an increasingly}} popular design choice, which insulates the engine from {{the external environment}} and retains heat in the engine after it is turned off. This decelerates motor cool-down and increases the probability for high initial temperature at a subsequent engine start, resulting in shorter warm-up and reduced friction between engine parts.  This work investigates thermal engine encapsulation (TEE) {{as a means to}} reduce engine friction and fuel consumption during engine warm-up. In order to predict the effects of TEE on the fuel consumption, it is necessary to model a wide range of thermal phenomena in different subsystems of the powertrain. The presented work proposes an integrated simulation methodology that enables efficient numerical simulations of heat transfer in the powertrain cooling systems and the engine structures not only during dynamic driving but also during the process of engine cool-down when the vehicle is parked. The integrated simulation includes a number sub-models that capture relevant phenomena in the vehicle powertrain and underhood. Presented in detail is the simulation procedure, which ultimately predicts the continuous development of the temperatures of the engine oil and the coolant as well as the temperatures of the different engine parts and components from the powertrain cooling system. An automated coupling between the one-dimensional (1 D) thermal representation of the engine and powertrain cooling systems with a three-dimensional (3 D) CFD model of buoyancy-driven flow in the engine bay computes the heat rejection during engine cool-down. By use of an integrated friction <b>correction</b> map the <b>engine</b> model computes the variation of friction losses at different engine temperatures. The integrated simulation model makes possible to predict the temperature of engine structures after a long period of engine inactivity preceded by dynamic driving, the exact temperature development of engine structures and cooling fluids after a recurring engine start, as well as the variations in the instantaneous fuel consumption.  Furthermore, a TEE concept for a passenger vehicle has been designed. The presented simulation method is applied to evaluate the effect of the proposed encapsulation on the development of engine temperatures during cool-down and their effect on the fuel consumption during a sequence of two Worldwide harmonized light vehicle test cycles (WLTC) separated with a period of inactivity. The results indicate a significant capability of encapsulations with high degree of coverage to retain engine heat for long time periods after key-off. The obtained results show that the encapsulated engine setup has potential for up to 3. 1 % savings of the fuel burned during a WLTC by a non-encapsulated engine in a cold environment. The amount of fuel saved depends primarily on the specific engine (mass, size and geometry), encapsulation design (geometry, thickness and degree of coverage), ambient temperature, and time of inactivity between engine shut-down and start-up. For periods of inactivity between 2 to 8 hours the potential for fuel saving is at least 2. 5 % of the total fuel burned during WLTC at ambient temperature of 5 °C for encapsulation with 97 % coverage...|$|R
