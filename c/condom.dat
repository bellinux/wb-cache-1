5|$|Although {{couples are}} {{starting}} to use condoms during extramarital intercourse more frequently, <b>condom</b> use during marital sex is still viewed as inappropriate by many Malawians; in 2000, only 2.3% of people reported using condoms regularly during sexual intercourse with their spouses. Some people believe that condoms are only necessary during sex with high-risk partners such as sex workers, and that <b>condom</b> use during marital sex implies infidelity. Others believe that marital <b>condom</b> use violates the religious purposes of marriage: sexual pleasure and reproduction. In {{a study published in}} 2007 by Agnes M. Chimbiri, men claimed that they use condoms with their wives for the sake of avoiding unwanted pregnancies; on the other hand, they were more concerned about sexually transmitted infections when discussing <b>condom</b> use with extramarital sexual partners.|$|E

5|$|Many Western Catholics and non-Catholics have voiced {{disagreement}} on the Church's support for natural family planning, and contend {{it contributes to}} overpopulation and poverty. The Church's rejection of <b>condom</b> use is widely criticized, in particular with regard to countries where the incidence of AIDS and HIV has reached epidemic proportions. In its defense, Catholics cite countries such as Kenya and Uganda, where behavioral changes are encouraged instead of <b>condom</b> use, and where greater progress in controlling the disease has been made than in countries that promote <b>condom</b> use alone.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>condoms</b> have a {{reservoir}} tip or teat end, {{making it easier}} to accommodate the man's ejaculate. <b>Condoms</b> come in different sizes, from oversized to snug and they also {{come in a variety of}} surfaces intended to stimulate the user's partner. <b>Condoms</b> are usually supplied with a lubricant coating to facilitate penetration, while flavored <b>condoms</b> are principally used for oral sex. As mentioned above, most <b>condoms</b> are made of latex, but polyurethane and lambskin <b>condoms</b> also exist.|$|R

50|$|Female <b>condoms</b> {{are made}} of two {{flexible}} polyurethane rings and a loose-fitting polyurethane sheath. According to laboratory testing, female <b>condoms</b> are effective in preventing the leakage of body fluids and therefore the transmission of STIs and HIV. Several studies show that between 50% and 73% {{of women who have}} used this type of <b>condoms</b> during intercourse find them as or more comfortable than male <b>condoms.</b> On the other hand, acceptability of these <b>condoms</b> among the male population is somewhat less, at approximately 40%. Because the cost of female <b>condoms</b> is higher than male <b>condoms,</b> there have been studies carried out with the aim of detecting whether they can be reused. Research has shown that structural integrity of polyurethane female <b>condoms</b> is not damaged during up to five uses if it is disinfected with water and household bleach. However, regardless of this study, specialists still recommend that female <b>condoms</b> be used only once and then discarded.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{the vast}} scope of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, many Malawian men believe that HIV {{contraction}} and death from AIDS are inevitable. Older men in particular often claim that the HIV/AIDS epidemic is a punishment issued by God or other supernatural forces. Other men refer to their own irresponsible sexual behaviors when explaining why they believe that death from AIDS is inevitable. These men sometimes claim that unprotected sex is natural (and therefore necessary and good) when justifying their lack of <b>condom</b> use during sex with extramarital partners. Finally, some men identify as HIV-positive without having undergone testing for HIV, preferring {{to believe that they}} have already been infected so they can avoid adopting undesirable preventative measures such as <b>condom</b> use or strict fidelity. Because of these fatalistic beliefs, many men continue engaging in extramarital sexual relations despite the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Malawi.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 activist Bill Baird {{was arrested}} for distributing a {{contraceptive}} foam and a <b>condom</b> to a student during a lecture on birth control and abortion at Boston University. Baird's appeal of his conviction resulted in the United States Supreme Court case Eisenstadt v. Baird (1972), which extended the Griswold holding to unmarried couples, and thereby legalized birth control for all Americans.|$|E
5|$|This is {{believed}} to be due to the increased exposure of mucosal tissue to potential infection sites. Transmission risk from infected female to male is around 4â€“5% annually. Suppressive antiviral therapy reduces these risks by 50%. Antivirals also help prevent the development of symptomatic HSV in infection scenarios, meaning the infected partner will be seropositive but symptom-free by about 50%. <b>Condom</b> use also reduces the transmission risk significantly. <b>Condom</b> use is much more effective at preventing male-to-female transmission than vice versa. Previous HSV-1 infection may reduce the risk for acquisition of HSV-2 infection among women by a factor of three, although the one study that states this has a small sample size of 14 transmissions out of 214 couples.|$|E
40|$|Female <b>condoms</b> are an {{important}} option for dual protection from unintended pregnancy and HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, especially when male <b>condoms</b> cannot be used. Incorporating female <b>condoms</b> into other HIV prevention channels is a potential strategy to increase access for {{women and men in}} need of dual protection beyond male <b>condoms.</b> Policies recommend incorporating female <b>condoms</b> into two HIV prevention programs that have gained significant momentum and political support [...] prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) and voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC). However, {{there is a lack of}} clarity on how female <b>condoms</b> are being included at the programmatic level...|$|R
5000|$|Semen {{collectors}} are sheaths (<b>condoms)</b> made {{specifically for}} conception {{and approved by}} the FDA. Collection <b>condoms</b> are <b>condoms</b> primarily used to collect semen during sexual intercourse. Contraceptive <b>condoms</b> are generally made of latex, and are designed for contraception and preventing spread of sexually transmitted diseases. Collection <b>condoms</b> are sterile and made from silicone or polyurethane, as latex is somewhat harmful to sperm. They are usually non-lubricated and have a teat end or reservoir to collect the sperm. [...] Collection <b>condoms</b> may be used to facilitate the collection of semen by masturbation or they may be used to collect a semen sample through intercourse.|$|R
5000|$|The {{history of}} <b>condoms</b> goes {{back at least}} several centuries, and perhaps beyond. For most of their history, <b>condoms</b> have been used both {{as a method of}} birth control, and as a {{protective}} measure against sexually transmitted diseases. <b>Condoms</b> have been made from a variety of materials; prior to the 19th century, chemically treated linen and animal tissue (intestine or bladder) are the best documented varieties. Rubber <b>condoms</b> gained popularity in the mid-19th century, and in the early 20th century major advances were made in manufacturing techniques. Prior to the introduction of the combined oral contraceptive pill, <b>condoms</b> were the most popular birth [...] "control" [...] method in the Western world. In {{the second half of the}} 20th century, the low cost of <b>condoms</b> contributed to their importance in family planning programs throughout the developing world. <b>Condoms</b> have also become increasingly important in efforts to fight the AIDS pandemic. The oldest <b>condoms</b> ever excavated were found in a cesspit located in the grounds of Dudley Castle and were made from animal membrane, the <b>condoms</b> dated back to as early as 1642.|$|R
5|$|HIV/AIDS {{has had a}} {{great impact}} on society, both as an illness and as a source of discrimination. The disease also has large {{economic}} impacts. There are many misconceptions about HIV/AIDS such as the belief that it can be transmitted by casual non-sexual contact. The disease has become subject to many controversies involving religion including the Catholic Church's position not to support <b>condom</b> use as prevention. It has attracted international medical and political attention as well as large-scale funding since it was identified in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Non-governmental {{organizations}} such as Population Services International (Malawi), an organization that strives to improve the health of Malawians, and Banja La Mtsogolo, an organization that distributes information and resources related to family planning, have conducted campaigns advertising <b>condom</b> use as an effective form of protection against HIV/AIDS. Banja La Mtsogolo provides condoms to both men and women, and has significantly improved the availability of condoms for women in particular. Because of efforts by Population Services International, Banja La Mtsogolo, and many other organizations, condoms have become more widely available to many people in Malawi.|$|E
5|$|The most {{effective}} method of avoiding genital infections is by avoiding vaginal, oral, and anal sex. <b>Condom</b> use decreases the risk somewhat. Daily antiviral medication taken {{by someone who}} has the infection can also reduce spread. There is no available vaccine and once infected, there is no cure. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) and topical lidocaine {{may be used to}} help with the symptoms. Treatments with antiviral medication such as aciclovir or valaciclovir can lessen the severity of symptomatic episodes.|$|E

5|$|Globally, <b>condoms</b> are {{the most}} common method of birth control. Male <b>condoms</b> are put on a man's erect penis and {{physically}} block ejaculated sperm from entering the body of a sexual partner. Modern <b>condoms</b> are most often made from latex, but some are made from other materials such as polyurethane, or lamb's intestine. Female <b>condoms</b> are also available, most often made of nitrile, latex or polyurethane. Male <b>condoms</b> have the advantage of being inexpensive, easy to use, and have few adverse effects. Making <b>condoms</b> available to teenagers does not appear to affect the age of onset of sexual activity or its frequency. In Japan about 80% of couples who are using birth control use <b>condoms,</b> while in Germany this number is about 25%, and in the United States it is 18%.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to linen, <b>condoms</b> during the Renaissance were {{made out of}} intestines and bladder.

5|$|The risk {{of sexual}} {{transmission}} of syphilis {{can be reduced}} by using a latex <b>condom.</b> Syphilis can be effectively treated with antibiotics. The preferred antibiotic for most cases is benzathine penicillin G injected into a muscle. In {{those who have a}} severe penicillin allergy, doxycycline or tetracycline may be used. In those with neurosyphilis, intravenous penicillin G potassium or ceftriaxone is recommended. During treatment people may develop fever, headache, and muscle pains, a reaction known as Jarisch-Herxheimer.|$|E
5|$|Although condoms {{effectively}} {{prevent the}} sexual transmission of HIV, several factors have limited widespread <b>condom</b> distribution and uptake in Malawi. People living in non-urban areas often have difficulty accessing condoms, and condoms are not typically available at bars {{and other social}} locations where {{they could have a}} significant impact on HIV prevention. Many people oppose condoms because they believe that condoms make sex less enjoyable or because they question their ability to prevent the transmission of HIV. However, despite these factors, many unmarried couples have started using condoms more consistently as concern and fear about the HIV/AIDS epidemic have increased.|$|E
5|$|Consistent <b>condom</b> use {{reduces the}} risk of HIV {{transmission}} by approximately 80% over the long term. When condoms are used consistently by a couple in which one person is infected, the rate of HIV infection is less than 1% per year. There is some evidence to suggest that female condoms may provide an equivalent level of protection. Application of a vaginal gel containing tenofovir (a reverse transcriptase inhibitor) immediately before sex seems to reduce infection rates by approximately 40% among African women. By contrast, use of the spermicide nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of transmission due to its tendency to cause vaginal and rectal irritation.|$|E
50|$|Other {{terms are}} also {{commonly}} used to describe <b>condoms.</b> In North America <b>condoms</b> are also commonly known as prophylactics, or rubbers. In Britain they may be called French letters. Additionally, <b>condoms</b> may be referred to using the manufacturer's name.|$|R
50|$|Polyisoprene is a {{synthetic}} version of natural rubber latex.

5|$|Improvements of {{existing}} birth control methods are needed, as around {{half of those}} who get pregnant unintentionally are using birth control at the time.

5|$|In October 1960, {{the group}} left Koschmider's club {{to work at}} the Top Ten Club, which Peter Eckhorn ran, as he offered the group more money and a {{slightly}} better place to sleep. In doing so they broke their contract with Koschmider. When Best and McCartney went back to the Bambi Kino to retrieve their belongings they found it in almost total darkness. As a snub to Koschmider, McCartney found a <b>condom,</b> attached it to a nail on the concrete wall of the room, and set it alight. There was no real damage done, but Koschmider reported them both for attempted arson. Best and McCartney spent three hours in a local prison and were subsequently deported, as was George Harrison, for working under the legal age limit, on 30 November 1960.|$|E
5|$|Many Western Catholics have voiced {{significant}} {{disagreement with}} the Church's teaching on contraception. Catholics for Choice, a political lobbyist group which is not associated with the Catholic Church, stated in 1998 that 96% of U.S. Catholic women had used contraceptives {{at some point in}} their lives and that 72% of Catholics believed that one could be a good Catholic without obeying the Church's teaching on birth control. Use of natural family planning methods among United States Catholics purportedly is low, although the number cannot be known with certainty. As Catholic health providers are among the largest providers of services to patients with HIV/AIDS worldwide, there is significant controversy within and outside the church regarding the use of condoms as a means of limiting new infections, as <b>condom</b> use ordinarily constitutes prohibited contraceptive use.|$|E
5000|$|Distribution of <b>condoms</b> in the United States {{was limited}} by {{passage of the}} Comstock laws, which {{included}} a federal act banning the mailing of contraceptive information (passed in 1873) as well as State laws that banned the manufacture and sale of <b>condoms</b> in thirty states. In Ireland the 1889 Indecent Advertisements Act made it illegal to advertise <b>condoms,</b> although their manufacture and sale remained legal. Contraceptives were illegal in 19th century Italy and Germany, but <b>condoms</b> were allowed for disease prevention. Despite legal obstacles, <b>condoms</b> continued to be readily available in both Europe and America, widely advertised under euphemisms such as male shield and rubber good.
