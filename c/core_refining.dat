The superstructure includes multiple pathways for {{conversion of the}} synthesis gas to liquid hydrocarbons via Fischer-Tropsch synthesis or intermediate methanol synthesis. Low-temperature and high-temperature Fischer-Tropsch processes are examined using both iron and cobalt based catalysts. Methanol may be converted to hydrocarbons via the methanol-to-gasoline or methanol-to-olefins processes. The hydrocarbons will be refined into the final liquid products using ZSM- 5 catalytic conversion, oligomerization, alkylation, isomerization, hydrotreating, reforming, and hydrocracking. A process synthesis framework is outlined to select the refining pathway that will produce the liquid fuels as the lowest possible cost. A rigorous deterministic branch-and-bound global optimization strategy will be incorporated to theoretically guarantee that the overall cost of the solution chosen by the synthesis framework is within {{a small fraction of}} the best possible value. A heat, power, and water integration is incorporated within the process synthesis framework to ensure that the cost of utility production and wastewater treatment are simultaneously included with the synthesis of the <b>core</b> <b>refining</b> processes.

40|$|The core is {{a central}} {{solution}} concept in cooperative game theory, and therefore {{it is important to}} know under what con-ditions the core of a game is guaranteed to be non-empty. Two notions that prove to be very useful in this context are Linear Programming (LP) duality and convexity. In this work, we ap-ply these tools to identify games with overlapping coalitions (OCF games) that admit stable outcomes. We focus on three notions of the core defined in (Chalkiadakis et al. 2010) for such games, namely, the conservative <b>core,</b> the <b>refined</b> <b>core</b> and the optimistic core. First, we show that the conservative core of an OCF game is non-empty if and only if the core of a related classic coalitional game is non-empty. This enables us to improve the result of (Chalkiadakis et al. 2010) by giving a strictly weaker sufficient condition for the non-emptiness of the conservative core. We then use LP duality to characterize OCF games with non-empty refined core; as a corollary, we show that the <b>refined</b> <b>core</b> of a game is non-empty as long as the superadditive cover of its characteristic function is con-vex. Finally, we identify a large class of OCF games that can be shown to have a non-empty optimistic core using an LP-based argument. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} on whether actual tidal morphologies are in equilibrium with current environmental conditions or retain signatures of past climatic changes or human interventions is a classical and fascinating one, furthermore being of intellectual {{as well as}} practical interest. Understanding the dynamic response of tidal landscapes to past conditions is critical to predict their response to future environmental changes, such as rate of relative sea-level rise and sediment supply. This is an open and fundamentally important point, particularly in times of natural and anthropogenic changes, during which tidal environments are most exposed to possibly irreversible transformations with far-reaching socio-economic and ecological implications worldwide. The proposed work aims at analyzing the signatures of changing environmental forcings imprinted in the landscape and in the sedimentary record of the Venice Lagoon to refine our knowledge of tidal landforms dynamics. The thesis is developed following a biogeomorphic approach {{to the study of}} salt-marsh landscapes. Marsh biomorphological evolution, in response to changes in the environmental forcings, is analyzed investigating the relative role and mutual interactions and adjustments between physical and biological processes shaping the salt-marsh landscape. This thesis was carried out through a series of extensive temporal and spatial high-resolution morphological, sedimentological, geochronological and elemental analyses, aimed at exploring the main features of sub-surface marsh samples and lagoonal sediment cores. The study of sub-surface marsh samples highlights the mutual role of inorganic and organic accretion on salt marshes, which is mainly driven by the inorganic component near the channels, while the organic component largely contributes in the inner-marsh portion. The analyses carried out on sediment <b>cores</b> <b>refine</b> the knowledge of the latest Holocene sedimentary succession of the Venice Lagoon, and furnish a chronostratigraphical model for the evolution over the last two millennia.

40|$|International audienceWe are hereby {{presenting}} a new dating method based on inverse techniques, which aims at calculating consistent gas and ice chronologies for several ice cores. The proposed method yields new dating scenarios simultaneously for several cores {{by making a}} compromise between the chronological information brought by glaciological modeling (i. e., ice flow model, firn densification model, accumulation rate model), and by gas and ice stratigraphic constraints. This method enables us to gather widespread chronological information and to use regional or global markers (i. e., methane, volcanic sulfate, Beryllium- 10, tephra layers, etc.) to link the core chronologies stratigraphically. Confidence intervals of the new dating scenarios can be calculated thanks to the probabilistic formulation of the new method, which takes into account both modeling and data uncertainties.

Investigation of the stratigraphic occurrence of diatom species shows that the youngest diatom event observed in the area is the last occurrence (LO) of Proboscia curvirostris (Jousé) Jordan and Priddle. P. curvirostris is a robust species that can easily be identified in the sediments, and therefore can be a practical biostratigraphic tool.

Further, we have correlated the LO P. curvirostris to the oxygen isotope records of six <b>cores</b> to <b>refine</b> the age of this biostratigraphic event. The extinction of P. curvirostris is latitudinally diachronous through Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 9 to 8 within the North Atlantic. This is closely related to the paleoceanography of the area. P. curvirostris first disappeared within interglacial MIS 9 (324 ka) from the northern areas that are most sensitive to climatic forcing, like the East Greenland current and the sea-ice margin. It survived in mid-North Atlantic until the conditions of the MIS 8 (glaciation) became too severe (260 ka). In the North Pacific at ODP Site 883 the LO P. curvirostris falls within MIS 8.

A basin-scale well-to-well correlation based on {{magnetic susceptibility}} records was also performed involving unpublished <b>cores.</b> To <b>refine</b> the age model, a Monte Carlo simulation was conducted using the Chinese Jingbian section as a tuning target. Spectral {{analysis of the}} tuned record revealed c. 400, c. 100 and c. 41 ka cycles over the 2. 5 million years of the Quaternary fluvial succession. To ensure a complementary palaeoclimate proxy, the full width at half maximum of smectites was measured as a facies-independent indicator of weathering intensity. This investigation was carried out on a subset of samples involved in MS measurements representing a c. 400 ka time interval {{across the top of}} the Olduvai subchron. A phase-shift between MS and weathering intensity recorded in the clay mineralogy indicates different response times of the considered proxies. The fluvial MS record is determined by the climatic control on delivery and preservation of magnetic minerals, mainly of magnetite. Under cold-and-dry climate these minerals were released owing to frost shattering in the adjacent hinterlands and were transported to alluvial plains in the early postglacial periods thanks to the increasing discharge of rivers. With further warming the weathering-sensitive magnetic minerals soon disappeared from the soils of the catchment area and thus from the fluvial load. As a result, in fluvial successions early postglacial warmings are expressed by the occurrences of MS maxima (magnetic episodes), while the palaeotemperature maximum and the subsequent cooling remain concealed within the tract of low MS values. The early postglacial magnetic episodes may serve as ideal stratigraphical markers in regional and global correlations...|$|R

We start by quantifying {{the properties of the}} C code in terms of operation types, available parallelism, and other metrics. We then create an initial data path to exploit the available parallelism. We then apply designer-guided constraints to an interactive data path refinement algorithm that attempts {{to reduce the number of}} the most expensive components while meeting the constraints. Our experimental results show that our technique scales very well with the size of the C code. We demonstrate the efficiency of our technique on wide range of applications, from standard academic benchmarks to industrial size examples like the MP 3 decoder. Each processor core was constructed and refined in under a minute, allowing the designer to explore several different configurations in much less time than needed for manual design. We compared our selection algorithm to the manual selection in terms of cost/performance and showed that our optimization technique achieves better cost/performance trade-off. We also synthesized our designs with programmable controller and, on average, the <b>refined</b> <b>core</b> have only 23 % latency overhead, twice as many block RAMs and 36 % fewer slices compared to the respective manual designs...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{techniques}} have been finding increasing use {{in all aspects}} of fracture mechanics, and often provide the only means for analyzing fracture problems. The work presented here, is concerned with the application of the finite element method to cracked structures. The present work was directed towards the establishment of a comprehensive two-dimensional finite element, linear elastic, fracture analysis package. Significant progress has been made to this end, and features which can now be studied include multi-crack tip mixed-mode problems, involving partial crack closure. The crack tip <b>core</b> element was <b>refined</b> and special local crack tip elements were employed to reduce the element density in the neighbourhood of the core region. The work builds upon experience gained by previous research workers and, as part of the general development, the program was modified to incorporate the eight-node isoparametric quadrilateral element. Also. a more flexible solving routine was developed, and provided a very compact method of solving large sets of simultaneous equations, stored in a segmented form. To complement the finite element analysis programs, an automatic mesh generation program has been developed, which enables complex problems. involving fine element detail, to be investigated with a minimum of input data. The scheme has proven to be versati Ie and reasonably easy to implement. Numerous examples are given to demonstrate the accuracy and flexibility of the finite element technique...|$|R
40|$|Conventional Severe Plastic Deformation (SPD) processes, such {{as equal}} channel angular {{pressing}} (ECAP) and high pressure torsion (HPT), {{have been used}} for mechanical improvement of commercially pure titanium. These techniques usually impose a relatively homogeneous deformation to the whole material volume. In this way, the mechanical properties generated due to the grain refinement from the process are uniformly distributed throughout the workpiece. A new technique, known as Gradation Extrusion, has been developed with the objective to produce a deformation gradient in the workpiece through a process that combines SPD forming and impact extrusion. This method allows to create a fine-grained structure near the surface and an increasing grain size in radial direction of the extruded bar. This microstructure distribution influences the material properties, providing to the material a high mechanical strength near the surface and a relatively good ductility due to the less <b>refined</b> <b>core.</b> These properties are interesting for several applications, such as dental implant or bolt manufacturing. A high level of mechanical strength is obtained, while a sufficient level of ductility is maintained which is needed to form the inner shape of the product. This work aims to evaluate the main advantages of the proposed method to possible industrial applications. Numerical simulations, experimental tests, microstructure analysis and microhardness tests were developed to assist the investigation...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{reconstruction of}} the alluvial architecture of the Coevorden gas Field (Tubbergen Formation, Upper Carboniferous), which {{is located in the}} northeastern part of the Netherlands, is presented. This reconstruction is based on well logs, cross-sections and paleogeographic maps. Sedimentological analysis of a 93 m long <b>core</b> allowed to <b>refine</b> the interpretation of the depositional environment. Accurate width determinations are necessary to correctly correlate fluvial sandbodies and reconstruct alluvial architecture. Without using sedimentological information, sandbody width is likely to be overestimated. A method developed by Bridge and Tye (2000) was used to calculate the width of one sandstone body from cross-set thicknesses. On the basis of this calculation and the paleogeographic reconstructions, it may be stated that on average the width of the channel belts we studied in the Coevorden field does not exceed 4 km. Moreover, our paleogeographic reconstructions, which point to a northwestern direction of paleoflow, are in accordance with earlier observations from the study area. The Tubbergen Formation and timeequivalent sediments in Germany are reviewed briefly to put the Coevorden Field in a regional context. The thickness of the Tubbergen Formation is 450 m in our study area. In the adjacent German area, time-equivalent sedimentary sequences reach higher thicknesses. This may be attributed to tectonic movements along the Gronau Fault zone and the coming into existence of the Ems Low, of which the Coevorden Field is the westernmost part...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} results of TRIFFID {{simultaneous}} V- and B-band observations of the cores of the globular clusters M 15, M 92 and NGC 6712. A variability search of their dense centres was made feasible through performing post-exposure image sharpening on the images, increasing the image resolution {{by a factor of}} ∼ 2. The ISIS implementation of the image subtraction technique developed by Alard & Lupton was then used to detect flux variations in our image sets. We have obtained periods for all observable variables (in our field of view) in NGC 6712 and we have found two new RR Lyrae variables (an RRab and an RRc). We have confirmed three variables in our field of view of the M 92. For M 15, we detect 48 variables in our field of view, 23 of which are new discoveries. We obtain periods and amplitudes for all variables and classify new ones based on the light-curve shape, the most significant period and the mean magnitude in the V band. Among the detected RR Lyrae we find 19 RRc, 12 RRab and two RRd types. In the subsequent analysis we find a marked increase in RRc over RRab variables in the <b>core.</b> In a <b>refined</b> procedure to search for fainter objects we find no dwarf novae in our field of view of M 15. Simulations performed on the data set to quantify our sensitivity to such objects indicate that an upper limit of 10 dwarf novae (at 92 per cent probability) exist in our field of view. The implications this result has on globular clusters are discussed...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: With the {{consecutive}} {{progress in}} the process technology and state-of-the-art design methodology, multi-million gate-counts system-on-a-chip (SoC) design can be realistically fulfilled. However, the rapid prototyping verification and integration for SoC designs reveal a big challenge. In this paper, we propose an ARM-based SoC prototyping platform using Aptix to accelerate the verification and integration process. The developed infrastructure in the prototyping platform consists of an ARM 920 T <b>core</b> module, a <b>refined</b> EASY system, an AHB-compliant slave component and many reconfigurable function blocks. On one hand, before silicon proof, since ARM Inc. only provides the design sign-off model for the ARM processor core, designer needs to spend lots of time to simulate and verify the ARM-based SoC design with software-based simulation method. On the other hand, due to many available intellectual property (IP) designs from the public domain and academics, it is desired to shrink the integration time via a common platform. Thus, the proposed ARM-based SoC prototyping platform not only speeds up ARM-based SoC system verification using real hardware acceleration instead of the design sign-off model, but also provides the integration facility via AMBA bus for distinct IP components. Importantly, the ARM-based SoC prototyping platform is very suitable for computation-intensive multimedia applications such as JPEG- and MPEG-oriented SoC designs. To demonstrate the performance and functionality of this platform, we use JPEG as our reference application to expose how JPEG can be rapidly prototyped via hardware/software codesign and accelerated hardware simulation. Through ARM-based SoC prototyping platform, the experimental {{results show that the}} system verification can be significantly speeded up by a factor of 1410 compared with that using the desig...|$|R
