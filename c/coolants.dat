The group's {{task was to}} design the production nuclear reactors that would convert uranium into plutonium. At the time, reactors existed only on paper, and no reactor had yet gone critical. In July 1942, Wigner chose a conservative 100 MW design, with a graphite neutron moderator and water cooling. The choice of water as a coolant was controversial at the time.

5|$|In 1943, Urey {{brought in}} Hugh S. Taylor from Princeton University {{to look at}} the problem of a usable barrier. Libby made {{progress}} on understanding the chemistry of uranium hexafluoride, leading to ideas on how to prevent corrosion and plugging. Chemical researchers at the SAM Laboratories studied fluorocarbons, which resisted corrosion, and could be used as lubricants and <b>coolants</b> in the gaseous diffusion plant. Despite this progress, the K-25 Project was in serious trouble without a suitable barrier, and by August 1943 it was facing cancellation. On 13 August Groves informed the Military Policy Committee, the senior committee that steered the Manhattan Project, that gaseous diffusion enrichment in excess of 50 percent was probably infeasible, and that the gaseous diffusion plant would be limited to producing product with a lower enrichment that could be fed into the calutrons of the Y-12 electromagnetic plant. Urey therefore began preparations to mass-produce the Norris-Adler barrier, despite its problems.|$|E

40|$|Use of water-base <b>coolant</b> is a {{pre-requisite}} in an {{high speed}} grinding process to avoid thermal damage {{and to achieve}} better surface integrity as well as higher grinding ratio. However, the presence of hazardous chemical additives in the <b>coolant</b> causes environmental problems. As a result, stringent government legislation is being practiced for the <b>coolant</b> use and disposal, which consumes 7 - 17 % of the total machining cost. This paper reports the <b>coolant</b> flux minimization through controlled jet impingement so as to prolong the <b>coolant</b> replenishment cycle. Control of <b>coolant</b> flux was achieved through development of a "metered quantity coolant" (MQC) nozzle which supplies the required amount of <b>coolant</b> to the grinding zone. Also, this investigation has shown that <b>coolant</b> velocity has a significant influence on the high speed grinding performance. When the <b>coolant</b> velocity is inadequate, <b>coolant</b> could not penetrate into the grinding zone. The increase in <b>coolant</b> velocity was realized with reduction in nozzle opening area and does not use a large quantity of <b>coolant.</b> This is of significance to reduce environmental pollution and machining costs through extended <b>coolant</b> replenishment period.

The BMW-powered BT50 made its debut {{at the start of the}} 1982 season, taking advantage of the high-altitude Kyalami circuit in South Africa, which favoured turbocharged cars. However, the as yet unreliable BMW-powered cars were dropped for the next two races. Piquet finished first at the Brazilian Grand Prix in a BT49D, but was disqualified after a protest from Renault and Ferrari on the grounds that the car had raced underweight due to its water-cooled brakes. FISA ruled that in future all cars must be weighed before <b>coolants</b> were topped up, resulting in a boycott of the fourth race of the season by most of the DFV-powered teams, including Brabham. Under threat from BMW, Brabham did not use its Ford-powered BT49s again until the sixth race of the season, the Monaco Grand Prix, where one was entered for Riccardo Patrese alongside Piquet in a BT50. Patrese won the race after a chaotic final lap on which several other cars stopped. Patrese used the BT49 for the next two races, taking a second place behind Piquet's BMW-powered car in the BT49's final Formula One race, the 1982 Canadian Grand Prix.|$|E

Since the reactor <b>coolant</b> system is completely flooded during normal operations, {{there is no point}} in monitoring <b>coolant</b> level in any of the other vessels. But early awareness of a reduction of <b>coolant</b> level (or a loss of <b>coolant)</b> is important to the safety of the reactor core. The pressurizer is deliberately located high in the reactor containment building such that, if the pressurizer has sufficient <b>coolant</b> in it, one can be reasonably certain that all the other vessels of the reactor <b>coolant</b> system (which are below it) are fully flooded with <b>coolant.</b> There is therefore, a <b>coolant</b> level monitoring system on the pressurizer and it is the one reactor <b>coolant</b> system vessel that is normally not full of <b>coolant.</b> The other secondary function is to provide a [...] "cushion" [...] for sudden pressure changes in the reactor <b>coolant</b> system. The upper portion of the pressurizer is specifically designed to NOT contain liquid <b>coolant</b> and a reading of full on the level instrumentation allows for that upper portion to not contain liquid <b>coolant.</b> Because the <b>coolant</b> in the pressurizer is quite hot during normal operations, the space above the liquid <b>coolant</b> is vaporized <b>coolant</b> (steam). This steam bubble provides a cushion for pressure changes in the reactor <b>coolant</b> system and the operators ensure that the pressurizer maintains this steam bubble at all times during operations. Allowing this steam bubble to disappear by filling the pressurizer to the top with liquid <b>coolant</b> is called letting the pressurizer [...] "go hard" [...] meaning there is no cushion and any sudden pressure change can provide a hammer effect to the entire reactor <b>coolant</b> system. Some facilities also call this letting the pressurizer [...] "go solid," [...] although solid simply refers to being completely full of liquid and without a [...] "steam bubble." ...|$|R

5000|$|A Pressurizer is a {{component}} of a pressurized water reactor. The basic design of the pressurized water reactor includes a requirement that the <b>coolant</b> (water) in the reactor <b>coolant</b> system must not boil.

40|$|An {{analytical}} {{investigation on}} the effect of high aspect ratio (height/width) cooling channels, considering different <b>coolant</b> channel designs, on hot-gas-side wall temperature and <b>coolant</b> pressure drop for a liquid hydrogen cooled rocket combustion chamber, was performed. <b>Coolant</b> channel design elements considered were: length of combustion chamber in which high aspect ratio cooling was applied, number of <b>coolant</b> channels, and <b>coolant</b> channel shape. Seven <b>coolant</b> channel designs were investigated using a coupling of the Rocket Thermal Evaluation code and the Two-Dimensional Kinetics code. Initially, each <b>coolant</b> channel design was developed, without consideration for fabrication, to reduce the hot-gas-side wall temperature from a given conventional cooling channel baseline. These designs produced hot-gas-side wall temperature reductions up to 22 percent, with <b>coolant</b> pressure drop increases as low as 7. 5 percent from the baseline. Fabrication constraints for milled channels were applied to the seven designs. These produced hot-gas-side wall temperature reductions of up to 20 percent, with <b>coolant</b> pressure drop increases as low as 2 percent. Using high aspect ratio cooling channels for {{the entire length of the}} combustion chamber had no additional benefit on hot-gas-side wall temperature over using high aspect ratio cooling channels only in the throat region, but increased <b>coolant</b> pressure drop 33 percent. Independent of <b>coolant</b> channel shape, high aspect ratio cooling was able to reduce the hot-gas-side wall temperature by at least 8 percent, with as low as a 2 percent increase in <b>coolant</b> pressure drop. ne design with the highest overall benefit to hot-gas-side wall temperature and minimal <b>coolant</b> pressure drop increase was the design which used bifurcated cooling channels and high aspect ratio cooling in the throat region.

Still, a diesel engine can be left idling unattended for hours or even days, especially since practically every diesel engine used in locomotives has systems that automatically shut the engine down if problems such as a loss of oil pressure or coolant loss occur. In recent years, automatic start/stop systems such as SmartStart have been adopted, which monitor coolant and engine temperatures.
