25|$|Mariners' {{compasses}} {{can have}} two or more magnets permanently attached to a <b>compass</b> <b>card,</b> which moves freely on a pivot. A lubber line, {{which can be a}} marking on the compass bowl or a small fixed needle, indicates the ship's heading on the <b>compass</b> <b>card.</b> Traditionally the card is divided into thirty-two points (known as rhumbs), although modern compasses are marked in degrees rather than cardinal points. The glass-covered box (or bowl) contains a suspended gimbal within a binnacle. This preserves the horizontal position.|$|E
25|$|Originally, many {{compasses}} {{were marked}} only {{as to the}} direction of magnetic north, or to the four cardinal points (north, south, east, west). Later, these were divided, in China into 24, and in Europe into 32 equally spaced points around the <b>compass</b> <b>card.</b> For a table of the thirty-two points, see compass points.|$|E
25|$|Cash fares (single-use Compass tickets) {{purchased}} at ticket machines in stations on Sea Island include an AddFare of $5.00 {{on top of}} the normal fare. This charge is also added to trips initiated on Sea Island that travel east beyond Sea Island using <b>Compass</b> <b>Card</b> Stored Value or DayPasses. It is not applied to trips using monthly passes, nor to trips using DayPasses or single-use Compass tickets which were purchased outside the Airport Zone. The AddFare came into effect on January 18, 2010. The revenue collected from the AddFare goes back to TransLink.|$|E

25|$|It was {{announced}} on August 14, 2013, that bus-issued transfers (magnetic strip paper cards) {{would continue to}} be issued for cash fares paid on buses, but that these transfers would not work at SkyTrain or SeaBus station fare gates, which require the <b>Compass</b> <b>Card.</b> This means that a bus rider paying cash is required to pay a second fare to transfer to SkyTrain or SeaBus. Those transit users paying cash but beginning their trips at a SkyTrain or SeaBus station are not subject to this second fare because they are issued paper-based Compass Tickets which are accepted as valid transfers on TransLink buses.|$|E
25|$|On April 4, 2016, Translink's new fare gates were {{implemented}} for ridership on SkyTrain and SeaBus. To open the fare gates, to enter or exit the system, a <b>Compass</b> <b>Card</b> must be used. Compass Cards {{may be used}} to pay fares on and buses, although FareSaver tickets may still be used on buses. Buses continue issue paper passes for fares paid in cash. Neither FareSavers nor the transfer tickets {{may be used to}} open fare gates. Compass Cards work on all transit services using a tap in method to pay fares. Tap out however is not required on buses. The cards may be loaded with monthly passes, day passes, or stored value, or any combination, with the ability to auto-load the fare choice. Annual passes have been eliminated.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Compass</b> <b>Card</b> is {{an orange}} or yellow, credit-card-sized {{contactless}} smartcard which {{can hold a}} transit pass, such as a Day Pass, a 14-Day Pass, etc. The <b>Compass</b> <b>Card</b> card must tapped on an electronic <b>Compass</b> <b>Card</b> validator when entering and transferring within the system in order to validate the fare. [...] <b>Compass</b> <b>Card</b> readers are integrated in bus fareboxes, and standalone readers are located just outside the paid-area of Trolley and rail stations.|$|E
50|$|As of January 2012, {{customers}} may {{purchase and}} add value to <b>Compass</b> <b>Cards</b> at 42 Albertson’s grocery stores in North San Diego County.|$|R
50|$|Translink {{estimated}} that 80,000 users {{were using the}} system {{by the end of}} January 2014. As of June 2016, <b>Compass</b> <b>cards</b> had been tapped on the system more than 371 million times, at a rate of more than 1.5 million every weekday. Translink recorded a ridership increase of 1.8 percent and 3.2 percent in increased fare revenues in 2015, according to its 2015 annual report.|$|R
50|$|A FareCard was {{a monthly}} pass that entitles the holder to {{unlimited}} travel within the month shown. Until December 31, 2013, two adults (14 and older) {{and up to}} four children (13 and younger) were allowed to ride on one adult FareCard on Sundays and Holidays. Concession FareCards were valid for three zones. The last FareCards were issued {{for the month of}} December 2015 and were permanently replaced by <b>Compass</b> <b>Cards.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Fare {{collection}} {{is based on}} a proof-of-payment system. [...] The San Diego Trolley is a barrier-free (no turnstiles), self-service system. [...] Patrons must have proof of fare (ticket or pass) before boarding. [...] Self-serve ticket vending machines are located at each station. [...] <b>Compass</b> <b>Card</b> (see below) users must [...] "tap" [...] at a <b>Compass</b> <b>Card</b> validator (located at various points around each Trolley station, and on MTS buses) or on the <b>Compass</b> <b>Card</b> target on a ticket vending machine before boarding a trolley. [...] Random fare inspections are performed by roving transit enforcement personnel. [...] Based on frequent security inspections, nearly 98% of the 37 million patrons have proper fares.|$|E
2500|$|The {{military}} forces {{of a few}} nations, notably the United States Army, continue to issue field compasses with magnetized compass dials or cards instead of needles. [...] A magnetic card compass is usually equipped with an optical, lensatic, or prismatic sight, which allows the user to read the bearing or azimuth off the <b>compass</b> <b>card</b> while simultaneously aligning the compass with the objective (see photo). [...] Magnetic card compass designs normally require a separate protractor tool {{in order to take}} bearings directly from a map.|$|E
2500|$|Because the Earth's {{magnetic}} field's inclination {{and intensity}} vary at different latitudes, compasses are often balanced during manufacture {{so that the}} dial or needle will be level, eliminating needle drag which can give inaccurate readings. [...] Most manufacturers balance their compass needles for one of five zones, ranging from zone 1, covering most of the Northern Hemisphere, to zone 5 covering Australia and the southern oceans. This individual zone balancing prevents excessive dipping of {{one end of the}} needle which can cause the <b>compass</b> <b>card</b> to stick and give false readings.|$|E
5000|$|In September 2008, SANDAG {{introduced}} a new contactless [...] "Compass Card", made possible by Cubic Transportation Systems, Inc. The [...] "Compass Card" [...] allows passengers from MTS and NCTD to store regional transit passes and cash value on a rewritable RFID card. Customers can purchase passes and add cash value on the Internet or at any ticket vending machine. Prior to boarding a train, customers tap their <b>Compass</b> <b>Cards</b> on the ticket validator located on the train platform. The LED display on the validator then lights up with lights resembling that of a stoplight, and the LCD display shows text regarding the passenger's fare account.|$|R
25|$|Construction of SkyTrain fare {{gates was}} {{completed}} in May 2014 but they remained unclosed until April 2016 owing to multiple system problems. While open for the nearly two-year period, holders of paper-based monthly passes, bus-issued transfers, and FareSaver tickets continued {{to pass through the}} gates into the stations' fare-paid zones unimpeded, although they were subject to having their fare inspected by transit security or transit police once inside the fare-paid zone. Starting in April 2016, they were initially fully closed only during peak hours, with one gate remaining open during off-peak times for people with accessibility issues who could not reach their <b>Compass</b> <b>Cards</b> to the fare gates to tap in or out. Full implementation of the fare gates was also delayed by problems with <b>Compass</b> <b>Cards</b> when riders were tapping out as they exited buses. The tapping-out process on buses was too slow and did not always record the tap which—because the system initially deducted a three-zone fare until a tap-out was recorded and a refund was issued to those having only travelled one or two zones—often resulted in customers being charged for travelling through three zones when in fact they had only travelled through one or two. This was a serious setback for TransLink as the entire system was supposed to be operational by 2013. A solution was finally implemented where the requirement to tap out of buses was removed and all bus travel was considered as within a single zone, creating significant savings for those travelling multiple zones using buses only and in some cases changing transit usage patterns. The last fare gates left open for users with accessibility issues were closed on July 25, 2016, and the system has been in full operation since.|$|R
25|$|A similar {{process is}} used to {{calibrate}} the compass in light general aviation aircraft, with the <b>compass</b> deviation <b>card</b> often mounted permanently just above or below the magnetic compass on the instrument panel. Fluxgate electronic compasses can be calibrated automatically, and can also be programmed with the correct local compass variation so as to indicate the true heading.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>Compass</b> <b>Card</b> {{is a form}} of {{electronic}} ticketing used on public transport services within San Diego County, California. It is administered by the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) [...] and is valid for travel on a number of different transit systems within San Diego County including MTS buses, the San Diego Trolley, North County Buses, the Coaster commuter rail line and the SPRINTER (a light rail line in north San Diego County). The card and fare collection systems are manufactured by Cubic Transportation Systems, and SANDAG administers the Compass Call Center (CCC), a central call center for all agencies.|$|E

50|$|It was {{announced}} on August 14, 2013, that bus transfer system (magnetic strip paper cards) {{would continue to}} be used for cash fares, and bus to bus transfers, but would not work at the turnstiles at train stations, which will require a <b>Compass</b> (RFID) <b>card.</b> This means that a bus rider paying cash would be required to buy an additional ticket to transfer to a train.|$|R
5000|$|Goos' famous world map titled Atlas ofte Water-Weereld was in two parts, one {{for each}} hemisphere. The {{colourful}} presentation included the two poles. His maritime maps encompassed not only Europe, Great Britain and Ireland but also the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. The Zee Atlas covered the English Channel, the Mediterranean and the Arctic Ocean {{as well as the}} Indian and Pacific Oceans. He also published regional maps covering the coastal areas of all the continents, facilitating navigation by including details of sandbars, sea depths and the islands near the coast. [...] A particular feature of the Goos maps was that they were embellished with [...] "large descriptive cartouches" [...] supplemented with sketches of ships, <b>compass</b> <b>cards,</b> and wind roses. His sea atlas of 1666, one of the most complete maritime atlases in existence {{in the second half of}} the seventeenth century, contained a frontispiece which featured ships in combat.Printed on thick paper with gilding, people bought the colourful maps just to decorate their offices and homes. At least one of Goos' atlases was published by his widow.|$|R

6000|$|A [...] "Departure" [...] is {{not what}} a vain people of landsmen may think. The term [...] "Landfall" [...] is more easily understood; you fall in with the land, {{and it is a}} matter of a quick eye and of a clear atmosphere.

But there is this {{difference}} in the Departure: that the term does not imply so much a sea event as a definite act entailing a process--the precise observation of certain landmarks by means of the <b>compass</b> <b>card.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then I feel a fan on my cheek, faint, so faint, that I {{can just}} sense it ere it is gone. But another comes, and another, until {{a real and}} just {{perceptible}} breeze is blowing. How the Snark's sails manage to feel it is beyond me, but feel it they do, as she does as well, for the <b>compass</b> <b>card</b> begins slowly to revolve in the binnacle. In reality, it is not revolving at all.

6000|$|With a blow {{from the}} top-maul Ahab knocked off the steel {{head of the}} lance, and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining, bade him hold it upright, without its {{touching}} the deck. Then, with the maul, after repeatedly smiting {{the upper end of}} this iron rod, he placed the blunted needle endwise on the top of it, and less strongly hammered that, several times, the mate still holding the rod as before. Then going through some small strange motions with it--whether indispensable to the magnetizing of the steel, or merely intended to augment the awe of the crew, is uncertain-- he called for linen thread; and moving to the binnacle, slipped out the two reversed needles there, and horizontally suspended the sail-needle by its middle, over one of the <b>compass</b> <b>cards.</b> At first, the steel went round and round, quivering and vibrating at either end; but at last it settled to its place, when Ahab, who had been intently watching for this result, stepped frankly back from the binnacle, and pointing his stretched arm towards it, exclaimed,--"Look ye, for yourselves, if Ahab be not the lord of the level loadstone! The sun is East, and that compass swears it!" ...|$|R
50|$|The compass {{shows the}} aircraft's heading {{relative}} to magnetic north. Errors include Variation, or {{the difference between}} magnetic and true direction, and Deviation, caused by the electrical wiring in the aircraft, which requires a <b>Compass</b> Correction <b>Card.</b> Additionally, the <b>compass</b> is subject to Dip Errors. While reliable in steady level flight it can give confusing indications when turning, climbing, descending, or accelerating due to the inclination of the Earth's magnetic field. For this reason, the heading indicator is also used for aircraft operation, but periodically calibrated against the compass.|$|R
50|$|Flux-gate {{compasses}} {{are built}} into several models of dive computer {{as an extra}} function. They may require calibration when powered up, but calibration usually lasts {{as long as the}} processor is running. They are usually insensitive to tilt as there are no moving parts to jam.

60|$|The gong clanged down below. The {{balanced}} vibration of the dead-slow speed ceased {{together with}} every sound and tremor in the ship, {{as if the}} great stillness that reigned upon the coast had stolen in through her sides of iron and taken possession of her innermost recesses. The illusion of perfect immobility seemed to fall upon her from the luminous blue dome without a stain arching over a flat sea without a stir. The faint breeze she had made for herself expired, as if all at once the air had become too thick to budge; even the slight hiss of the water on her stem died out. The narrow, long hull, carrying its way without a ripple, seemed to approach the shoal water of the bar by stealth. The plunge of the lead with the mournful, mechanical cry of the lascar came at longer and longer intervals; and the men on her bridge seemed to hold their breath. The Malay at the helm looked fixedly at the <b>compass</b> <b>card,</b> the Captain and the Serang stared at the coast.|$|E
60|$|The steam gear clattered, stopped, clattered again; and the helmsman's eyeballs {{seemed to}} project out of a hungry face as if the <b>compass</b> <b>card</b> behind the {{binnacle}} glass had been meat. God knows how long he had been left there to steer, as if forgotten by all his shipmates. The bells had not been struck; {{there had been no}} reliefs; the ship's routine had gone down wind; but he was trying to keep her head north-north-east. The rudder might have been gone for all he knew, the fires out, the engines broken down, the ship ready to roll over like a corpse. He was anxious not to get muddled and lose control of her head, because the compass-card swung far both ways, wriggling on the pivot, and sometimes seemed to whirl right round. He suffered from mental stress. He was horribly afraid, also, of the wheelhouse going. Mountains of water kept on tumbling against it. When the ship took one of her desperate dives the corners of his lips twitched.|$|E
60|$|Compass for use at night.--The great {{majority}} of compasses are well-nigh useless in the dark, that is, when it is most important {{to be able to}} consult them. They are rarely so constructed, that the difference between the north and south sides is visible by moonlight or by the light of a cigar or piece of tinder. The more modern contrivances are very effective; in these the southern half of the <b>compass</b> <b>card</b> is painted black, the northern being left white. With a very faint light, this difference can be appreciated. In compasses consisting simply of a needle, {{the north end of the}} needle should have a conspicuous arrow-head. It is extraordinary how much the power of seeing a compass or a watch at night is increased by looking nearly at it through a magnifying-glass. Thus, young people who can focus their vision through a wide range may be observed poring with their eyes close to their books when the light wanes. So again, at night-time, a placard, even in large type, is illegible at a short distance, but easily read on approaching it. It seems, in order that a faint image on the retina should be appreciated by the nerves of sight, that image must have considerable extent.|$|E
5000|$|When a German {{military}} aircraft emerged from its production plant, {{it was given}} a four-letter Stammkennzeichen code (factory radio code), which was an individual aircraft's radio code before it entered service and staying with the aircraft throughout its entire existence. This format was also usually used for prototype aircraft {{if they did not}} bear a German national [...] "D-xxxx" [...] style civil registration. The entire Stammkennzeichen was usually on the fuselage sides, and also often repeated on the undersides of both wings, with the four letters spread out along the entire wing's under-surfaces. The code could also be placed on such things as the manufacturer's identification plate, and sometimes even the <b>compass</b> correction <b>card</b> for a particular aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Nearly half of Translink’s {{revenues}} {{come from}} fares. Translink uses a three-zone fare {{system in the}} region for SkyTrain, Canada Line, West Coast Express and SeaBus service, with single adult fares ranging from $2.85 to $5.60 on weekdays. All fares on buses across the region are set at the one zone rate of $2.85, a switch Translink made during the roll out of the <b>Compass</b> contactless smart <b>card</b> payment system.|$|R
2500|$|At sea, a ship's compass {{must also}} be {{corrected}} for errors, called deviation, caused by iron and steel in its structure and equipment. The ship is swung, that is rotated about a fixed point while its heading is noted by alignment with fixed points on the shore. A <b>compass</b> deviation <b>card</b> is prepared so that the navigator can convert between compass and magnetic headings. The compass can be corrected in three ways. First the lubber line can be adjusted {{so that it is}} aligned with the direction in which the ship travels, then the effects of permanent magnets can be corrected for by small magnets fitted within the case of the compass. The effect of ferromagnetic materials in the compass's environment can be corrected by two iron balls mounted {{on either side of the}} compass binnacle. The coefficient [...] representing the error in the lubber line, while [...] the ferromagnetic effects and [...] the non-ferromagnetic component.|$|R
