The highly interwoven financial operations of local government units and their utilities indicate the need for analysis of consolidated financial statements of local governments and utility companies {{in order to gain}} an insight into the real financial “health” of local units. Accordingly, the main aim {{of this paper is to}} analyze the size and the structure of the consolidated (local government and utility companies) local public debt in Croatia.

Although the current Budget Law does not require formal preparation of consolidated financial statements by local governments and their utility firms, consolidation is stipulated by International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS).

However, it remains silent {{when it comes to}} exposing the reason why a public sector entity should consolidate its financial statements. The literature is almost as silent as IPSAS on this issue. Which means that {{there is a lack of}} both theoretical and empirical knowledge on this subject. This paper explores the usefulness of the <b>consolidation</b> of financial <b>statements</b> (CFS) for different categories of users. It aims at investigating for which purposes consolidation is most useful and whether enlarging the scope of the consolidate group serves these purposes. Five purposes are considered: information, decision- making, accountability, risk-assessment, statistics improvement. The paper also aims at investigating if some categories of users consider CFS more useful than others. The issue is essentially empirical. Therefore it is examined in light of the results of an in-person interviews. We surveyed 25 members of parliament, officials, creditors, and consultants of the Swiss central government. The results show that consolidating FS is considered especially important and useful for risk- assessment, information and accountability and to a somewhat lesser extent for decision-making and statistics improvement. Extending the scope of CFS may improve the situation when it comes to statistics but it would only marginally make CFS more relevant for decision making. Consultants and, to a lesser extent, members of the finance ministry are those respondents who deem the scope enlargement to be the most useful...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{determine}} whether the requirement for New Zealand organisations to switch from the ownership-based method of consolidation to the control-based method of consolidation increased the value relevance of consolidated financial statements in New Zealand. It takes advantage of the unique situation whereby all listed entities in New Zealand were required to comply with FRS 37 : Consolidating Investments in Subsidiaries (FRS 37) in a year relatively free from changes to other financial standards. Motivation: The study was motivated by research undertaken by Hsu et al. (2012). Their research focused on the movement from the ownership-based method to the control-based method of <b>consolidation</b> of financial <b>statements</b> and whether this better reflected market value. They took advantage of the situation in Taiwan which similarly required all public firms to adopt Taiwan’s SFAS 7 : Consolidated Financial Statements (TSFAS 7) at a set time. Research question: Did the change from the ownership-based method of consolidation under SSAP 8 to the control-based method of consolidation under FRS 37 increase the value relevance of consolidated financial statements in New Zealand? Sample selection and design: A sample of 54 entities listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZX) was used. The sample, although small, represented all of the final available population. Analysis of common accounting ratios was carried out and accounting variables affected by the switch to FRS 37 were analysed to determine changes in the value relevance of the consolidated financial statements. Findings: The adoption of FRS 37 led to an increase in value relevance of financial statements in New Zealand. However the ability to apply judgement to the application of control highlighted entities holding a larger number of subsidiaries and associates had a more complex structure than anticipated. Therefore holdings indirectly controlled may not have been captured with a lower instance of consolidation being achieved than was anticipated...|$|R

The empirical material collected was used to verify several hypotheses related to non-controlling interests of the groups whose parents are registered in Poland and whose securities are traded on a regulated, Polish capital market (Warsaw Stock Exchange). The empirical evidence is that non-controlling interests represent a very small part of group’s equity (taking the mean of about 3. 5 %, but the median below 1 %) and obviously, they are significantly lower than the share of majority interests. Their deviation among the different classes of companies (big, small and banks) is negligible. Slightly higher is the share of minority interests in the group’s net profit and total comprehensive income. However, no significant difference is to be found between the shares of non-controlling interests in the group’s equity, net profit and total comprehensive income. Overall, shares of majority (minority) interests in a group’s income are in line with their shares in the group’s equity. The hypothesis on comparable returns on non-controlling and majority interests (in terms of ROE) cannot be rejected if both net profit and losses are considered. How-ever, if losses are skipped then there is evidence that non-controlling interests are more profitable than majority interests. Analysis of the impact of the number of subsidiaries in groups on non-controlling interests indicates the existence of such an effect only in relation to the equity (rather obvious but weak). No effect is observed for the impact on net profit for the entire sample...|$|R

Regarding the justification on the election for the theme stands out about the value that information can cost to the company and the impact that it will get in return, which is an important fact in spreading spontaneously. The theoretical platform used as a structure for this study was about the theory of disclosure, with issues of interest to disclose information to the external environment organizations. Complementarily, it was addressed the understanding of risk management, which highlights the characterization of risk, determined by the CPC nº. 40 / 09 relating to its evidence. The classification of the research is understood as descriptive, documentary and quantitative with the use of multivariate analysis technique, called Principal Components Analysis (PCA) for data analysis. The results show that the user needs information to support the decision process, that is latent in the research area and is a fact that contributes to the proper analysis of the evolution of the enterprises at the environment. Regarding to the method for analysis, it was noted that there is an evidence of information in the main components, because of the existence of high grouping of information. The variable of risk exposure, both in nature and in extent, became inverted, which represents a misalignment in relation to it is presented as a foundation, but with disclosure of information. rec� to(ڟ py� ement and disclosure and also in the Financial Statements.

The opportunity to develop this study is related to the intense search for better accounting practices, and the preparation of financial statements that convey its users reliability and transparency of public accounts, and the comparability of these statements from the authorities. In terms of methodology, the study was descriptive, documentary and qualitative. Data were collected on the websites of the surveyed entities, between the years of 2009 and 2010. The results show, from the analyzes carried out in this study, that the NBC T SP 16. 6, which deals with Financial Statements, was not observed in any of the states analyzed in 2009. The situation repeated itself in 2010, with the exception of the State of Santa Catarina which presented the Statement of Cash Flows in its Balance Sheet as well as the new structure of the Balance Sheet. What can be concluded is that NBC 16. 6 T was little observed by the states under review. However, NBC 16. 7 T, which addresses the <b>consolidation</b> of financial <b>statements,</b> was observed by virtually all states in the two years under review, with the exception only of the state of Rio Grande do Sul.  O propósito desta pesquisa é analisar o nível de evidenciação da natureza e extensão dos riscos decorrentes dos instrumentos financeiros nas Notas Explicativas (NE) de empresas listadas na BM&FBOVESPA que fazem parte do setor de produção industrial, com um total de 31 empresas.
