5000|$|The <b>crested</b> <b>guan</b> (Penelope purpurascens) is {{a member}} of an ancient group of birds of the Cracidae family, which are related to the Australasian mound builders. It is found in the Neotropics, in {{lowlands}} forests ranging from south Mexico and the Yucatán Peninsula to western Ecuador and southern Venezuela. The sexes are similar in appearance; the plumage is mainly dark brown with white spotting, an area of bare skin round the eye, bright red wattles, a bushy crest, a long broad tail and pink legs. It is a social bird, often seen in pairs or small family groups. It feeds in trees, mainly on fruit, and builds a nest of twigs on a branch. The two or three white eggs are incubated by the female. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated this bird's conservation status as [...] "least concern".|$|E
5000|$|Regardless {{of whether}} or not the dish was {{constructed}} in the pre-Hispanic period as it is today, the ancient Mayans would have had access to all of the basic ingredients used in the modern dish. Corn, tomatoes, and chiles were all staples in the Mesoamerican diet. Pumpkin seeds, likewise, were an important part of the Mayan diet. [...] Chicken eggs were unknown to pre-Hispanic Mayans, but several other fowl capable of providing eggs were known and eaten. Turkeys and muscovy ducks were both domesticated, and both produce edible eggs. In addition to that, the Mayans ate non-domesticated fowl including the curassow, <b>crested</b> <b>guan,</b> horned guan, chachalaca, and ocellated turkey, although it is unclear the extent to which edible eggs could have been obtained from these birds. [...] Aside from the eggs of fowl, iguana eggs were also used in Mayan cooking and could conceivably have been used to make this dish.|$|E
50|$|Of {{particular}} note is {{the presence}} of a number of species in the protected area considered endangered or vulnerable, and in need of protection within Belize. These include one of the two large game species (the great curassow), and the keel-billed motmot (Electron carinatum). The near threatened harpy eagle (Harpia harpyia) has also been recorded from Bladen (Marlin, pers. com., 2006, 2010) and in December 2010 researchers from Belize Foundation for Research and Environmental Education (BFREE) discovered a breeding pair of harpy eagles with a chick, the first ever recorded in Belize and also representing the extreme of their northerly range. The rare solitary eagle (Harpyhaliaetus solitarius) has been recorded from the adjacent Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary and Doyle’s Delight, with a high probability that its range includes Bladen. Other birds highlighted as being of concern include the second large game species <b>crested</b> <b>guan</b> (P. purpurascens), the ornate hawk-eagle (Spizaetus ornatus), and seasonally, the regionally endangered subspecies of the scarlet macaw (Ara Macao).|$|E
50|$|West Indian {{manatees}} were illegally hunted in the Port Honduras area in Belize {{at least}} {{until the end of the}} 1990s. Poachers were suspected to come from Guatemala and Honduras. Manatees were killed for meat, and their bones used for carving trinket and other souvenirs sold in local markets in the Yucatán Peninsula. In 2002, it was estimated that about 40 manatees are killed annually along the eastern Nicaraguan coast and in inland wetlands by poachers and incidental drowning in fishing nets.Other species poached in Central American countries and in the Dominican Republic for being traded alive include Geoffroy's spider monkey, margay, ocelot, great horned guan, <b>crested</b> <b>guan,</b> great curassow, ocellated turkey, great green macaw, Hispaniolan amazon, Hispaniolan parakeet, red-billed toucan, chestnut-mandible toucan, raptors, rosy boa, rattlesnake, Galápagos tortoise, beaded lizard, green iguana, poison dart frogs and freshwater turtles. Snakes, spectacled caiman, Morelet’s and American crocodiles are killed for their skins. Black iguana, mangrove cockle and queen conch are poached for consuming their meat.|$|E
5000|$|... 650 {{species of}} birds were {{identified}} in a 1993 survey, of which many are threatened.Species found in the most humid areas include the Baudo guan (Penelope ortoni), Berlepsch's tinamou (Crypturellus berlepschi), blue-whiskered tanager (Tangara johannae), brown wood rail (Aramides wolfi), crowned woodnymph (Thalurania colombica), El Oro parakeet (Pyrrhura orcesi), El Oro tapaculo (Scytalopus robbinsi), indigo flowerpiercer (Diglossa indigotica), long-wattled umbrellabird (Cephalopterus penduliger) and scarlet-breasted dacnis (Dacnis berlepschi).Species found in less humid areas include grey-backed hawk (Pseudastur occidentalis), ochraceous attila (Attila torridus) and rufous-headed chachalaca (Ortalis erythroptera). Humboldt's sapphire (Hylocharis humboldtii) is found only in the mangroves to the north. Species that have almost been wiped out due to hunting and habitat fragmentation include <b>crested</b> <b>guan</b> (Penelope purpurascens), great curassow (Crax rubra), great green macaw (Ara ambiguus), great tinamou (Tinamus major) and harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja).Endangered birds include banded ground cuckoo (Neomorphus radiolosus), Baudo guan (Penelope ortoni), Esmeraldas woodstar (Chaetocercus berlepschi), great green macaw (Ara ambiguus), grey-backed hawk (Pseudastur occidentalis), grey-cheeked parakeet (Brotogeris pyrrhoptera), rufous-brown solitaire (Cichlopsis leucogenys) and slaty becard (Pachyramphus spodiurus).|$|E
50|$|Bladen has {{two large}} {{resident}} game bird species, the great curassow (Crax rubra) and <b>crested</b> <b>guan</b> (Penelope purpurascens). Both these species, {{along with their}} more common relative, the plain chachalaca, are representatives of the Cracidae family - the most threatened of the Neotropical bird families and common hunting targets. Cracids are important seed dispersers and are a major protein source for local communities. Within Belize, both the curassow and the guan are locally common, and outside of protected areas such as Bladen, they are legal game species for those with hunting permits. However, the increase in agricultural colonists and seasonal Central American workers adjacent to the nature reserve has led to increased illegal hunting within the protected area, resulting in reduced populations of both species. This was noted by the 1992 and 1997 expeditions to Columbia River Forest Reserve directly south of Bladen, with reports that game species were unexpectedly scarce in even the upper elevations, suggesting increasing hunting pressure, with relatively easy access from Guatemala. Whether this is impacting Bladen itself is currently unknown, but the implications are that these areas, once considered pristine, should now be considered under threat. This pronounced negative response to hunting pressure makes these two species especially valuable as indicator species in areas where hunting still occurs.|$|E
