25|$|By now, the {{imminent}} threat of invasion {{had all but}} passed as the Luftwaffe had failed to gain the prerequisite air superiority. The aerial bombing was now principally aimed at the destruction of industrial targets, but also continued {{with the objective of}} breaking the morale of the civilian population. The attacks were focused against western ports in March. These attacks produced some breaks in morale, with <b>civil</b> <b>leaders</b> fleeing the cities before the offensive reached its height. But the Luftwaffes effort eased in the last 10 attacks as seven Kampfgruppen moved to Austria in preparation for the Balkans Campaign in Yugoslavia and Greece. The shortage of bombers caused OKL to improvise. Some 50 Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive-bombers and Jabos (fighter-bombers) were used, officially classed as Leichte Kampfflugzeuge ("light bombers") and sometimes called Leichte Kesselringe ("Light Kesselrings"). The defences failed to prevent widespread damage but on some occasions did prevent German bombers concentrating on their targets. On occasion, only one-third of German bombs hit their targets.|$|E
25|$|The Peloponnese peninsula, {{with its}} long {{tradition}} {{of resistance to the}} Ottomans, was to become the heartland of the revolt. In the early months of 1821, with the absence of the Ottoman governor of the Morea (Mora valisi) Hursid Pasha and many of his troops, the situation was favourable for the Greeks to rise against Ottoman occupation. The crucial meeting was held at Vostitsa (modern Aigion), where chieftains and prelates from all over the Peloponnese assembled on 26January. There, Papaflessas, a pro-revolution priest who presented himself as representative of Filiki Eteria clashed with most of the <b>civil</b> <b>leaders</b> and members of the senior clergy, such as Metropolitan Germanos of Patras, who were sceptical and demanded guarantees about a Russian intervention. As news came of Ypsilantis' march into the Danubian Principalities, the atmosphere in the Peloponnese was tense, and by mid-March, sporadic incidents against Muslims occurred, heralding the start of the uprising. According to the tradition, the Revolution was declared on 25March 1821 (N.S. 6April) by Metropolitan Germanos, who raised the banner with the cross in the Monastery of Agia Lavra, although some historians question the historicity of the event. There are no contemporary accounts of Metropolitan Germanos declaring independence. The story first appears in 1824 in a book written by a French diplomat François Pouqueville. British historian David Brewer has suggested that Poqueville may have fabricated the story to denounce Britain.|$|E

500|$|According to Neapope's {{erroneous}} report, Wabokieshiek ("White Cloud"), {{a shaman}} known to Americans as the [...] "Winnebago Prophet", had claimed that other tribes {{were ready to}} support Black Hawk. Wabokieshiek's mother was a Ho-Chunk (Winnebago), but his father had belonged to a Sauk clan that provided the tribe's <b>civil</b> <b>leaders.</b> When Wabokieshiek joined the British Band in 1832, he would become the ranking Sauk civil chief in the group. His village, Prophetstown, was about thirty-five miles up the Rock River from Saukenuk. The village was inhabited by about 200 Ho-Chunks, Sauks, Meskwakis, Kickapoos, and Potawatomis who were dissatisfied with tribal leaders who refused {{to stand up to}} American expansion. Although some Americans would later characterize Wabokieshiek as a primary instigator of the Black Hawk War, the Winnebago Prophet, according to historian John Hall, [...] "actually discouraged his followers from resorting to armed conflict with the whites".|$|E
2500|$|After an {{extended}} period of mourning for his father, Black Hawk resumed leading raiding parties over the next years, usually targeting the traditional enemy, the Osage. Black Hawk did not belong to a clan that provided the Sauk with hereditary <b>civil</b> <b>leaders,</b> or [...] "chiefs". He achieved status through his exploits as a warrior and by leading successful raiding parties. Men like Black Hawk are sometimes called [...] "war chiefs", but historian Patrick Jung writes, [...] "It is more accurate to call them 'war leaders' since the nature of their office and the power that it wielded was much different from that of a civil chief." [...] Twenty-first century historians such as John W. Hall have suggested the term [...] "war captain" [...] for this role.|$|E
2500|$|Biblical patriarchy as {{expressed}} by the Vision Forum is similar to Complementarianism in that it affirms the equality of men and women, but goes further in its expression of the different gender roles. Many {{of the differences between}} them are ones of degree and emphasis. While Complementarianism holds to exclusively male leadership in the church and in the home, biblical patriarchy extends that exclusion to the civic sphere as well, so that women should not be <b>civil</b> <b>leaders</b> and indeed should not have careers outside the home. Thus, William Einwechter refers to the traditional Complementarian view as [...] "two point complementarianism" [...] (male leadership in the family and church), and regards the biblical patriarchy view as [...] "three-point" [...] or [...] "full" [...] complementarianism, (male leadership in family, church and society). In contrast to this, John Piper and Wayne Grudem, representing the Complementarian position, say that they are [...] "not as sure in this wider sphere which roles can be carried out by men or women". Grudem also acknowledges exceptions to the submission of wives to husbands where moral issues are involved.|$|E

50|$|One {{particular}} {{activity that}} has not been funded - because it typically is not allowable under most national or bilateral funding - is the exchange of scientists and <b>civil</b> defence <b>leaders</b> between the various Decade Volcano projects of developing countries, for example, between the Philippines and Indonesia, or between Mexico, Guatemala, and Colombia, or across the Pacific and Atlantic. Often, scientists and <b>civil</b> defence <b>leaders</b> from developing countries can relate better to each other's experiences than they can to the experience of counterparts from industrialized countries. Also, <b>civil</b> defence <b>leaders</b> who have experienced volcanic crises are far more credible witnesses, in the eyes of local <b>civil</b> defence <b>leaders,</b> than either local or visiting scientists might be.|$|R
2500|$|According to {{historian}} John Mack Faragher, {{the religious}} and ethnic dimensions of the Expulsion of Acadians are in addition to, and deeply connected to, the military exigencies cited as causes for the Removals. There is significant evidence in the correspondence of military and <b>civil</b> <b>leaders</b> for Anti-Catholicism. Faragher writes, [...] "The first session of the Nova Scotia Assembly ... passed a series of laws intended to institutionalize Acadian dispossession" [...] including an act titled [...] "An Act for the Quieting of Possessions to Protestant Grantees of land formerly occupied by the French." [...] In it and two subsequent acts the Church of England was made the official religion. These acts granted certain political rights to Protestants while the new laws excluded Catholics from public office and voting and forbade Catholics from owning land in the province. It also empowered British authorities to seize all [...] "popish" [...] property (Church lands) for the crown and barred Catholic clergy from entering or residing in the province, as they wanted no repeat of Le Loutre and his type of war. In addition to other anti-Catholic measures, Faragher concludes [...] "These laws—passed by a popular assembly, not enacted by military fiat—laid {{the foundation for the}} migration of Protestant settlers." ...|$|E
