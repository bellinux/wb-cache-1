50|$|Pyridazines {{are rare}} in nature, {{possibly}} reflecting {{the scarcity of}} naturally occurring hydrazines, common building blocks for the synthesis of these heterocycles. The pyridazine structure is a popular pharmacophore which is found within a number of herbicides such as credazine, pyridafol and pyridate. It is also found within the structure of several drugs such as <b>cefozopran,</b> cadralazine, minaprine, pipofezine, and hydralazine.|$|E
50|$|Currently {{there are}} only two drugs in this category, Ceftobiprole and Ceftaroline. These new drugs are also the only β-lactam {{antibiotics}} that are effective against methicillin-resistant-Staphylococcus-aureus (MRSA). Ceftobiprole is a pyrrolidinone-3-ylidenemethyl cephem. The C-3 side chain was specifically designed to have a strong binding affinity to PBP2a and PBP2x. PBP2a is known to give staphylococci resistance to other β-lactam drugs and PBPx does the same for pneumococci. Ceftobiprole also has an aminothiazoylhydroxyimino side chain at the C-7 position which is known to give good resistance to β-lactamase from S. aureus. Together these active groups make Ceftobiprole bactericidal to MRSA. Ceftobiprole has poor water solubility and is therefore administered intravenously as an ester prodrug called Ceftobiprole medocaril. It is rapidly broken down into active Ceftobiprole by plasma esterases.Ceftaroline was developed from the fourth generation cephalosporin <b>Cefozopran.</b> It retains the alkoxyimino group at position C-7 from earlier generations so it is fairly stable in the presence of many β-lactamases. Since MRSA and penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae have resistance dedicated to new types of PBP, PBP2a and PBP2x respectively, both Ceftaroline and Ceftobiprole have C-3 side chains specially engineered to bind these new PBP. In the case of Ceftaroline this side chain contains a 2-thioazolythio spacer linkage optimised for its anti-MRSA activity. Ceftaroline has low water solubility but this problem was overcome by attaching a N-phosphonoamino group to the molecule making the intravenous prodrug Ceftaroline fosamil. The prodrug is dephosphorylated in plasma to form active Ceftaroline.|$|E
40|$|The {{therapeutic}} effect of <b>cefozopran</b> (SCE- 2787), a new semisynthetic parenteral cephalosporin, against experimental infections in mice was examined. <b>Cefozopran</b> {{was more effective}} than cefpiramide and was as effective as ceftazidime and cefpirome against acute respiratory tract infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae DT-S. In the model of chronic respiratory tract infection caused by K. pneumoniae 27, <b>cefozopran</b> was as effective as ceftazidime. The {{therapeutic effect}} of <b>cefozopran</b> against urinary tract infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa P 9 was superior to that of cefpirome and was equal to those of ceftazidime and cefclidin. In addition, <b>cefozopran</b> was more effective than ceftazidime and was as effective as flomoxef in a thigh muscle infection caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus 308 A- 1. Against thigh muscle infections caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus N 133, <b>cefozopran</b> was the most effective agent. The potent therapeutic effect of <b>cefozopran</b> in those experimental infections in mice suggests {{that it would be}} effective against respiratory tract, urinary tract, and soft tissue infections caused by a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in humans...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{radiation}} sterilization {{is one of}} the best methods for sterilizing vulnerable degradation drugs like <b>cefozopran</b> hydrochloride. Results: Chemical stability of radiosterylized <b>cefozopran</b> hydrochloride, was confirmed by spectrophotometric and chromatographic methods. EPR studies showed that radiation has created some radical defects whose concentration was no more than several dozen ppm. The antibacterial activity of <b>cefozopran</b> hydrochloride irradiated with a dose of 25  kGy was unaltered for Gram-positive bacteria but changed for two Gram-negative strains. The radiation sterilized <b>cefozopran</b> hydrochloride was not in vitro cytotoxic against human CCD 39 Lu normal lung fibroblast cell line. Conclusions: <b>Cefozopran</b> hydrochloride in solid state is not resistant to {{radiation sterilization}} and this method cannot be used for sterilization of this compound...|$|E
40|$|The {{concentration}} of <b>cefozopran</b> which inhibits binding of [MC]benzylpenicillin to penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 5 of Enterococcus faecalis TN 2 OO 5 by 50 % was 11 mg/L, and its MIC was 12. 5 mg/L. Ceftazidime and cefmenoxime, which were inactive at 100 mg/L, showed no affinity for PBP 5 at this concentration. Ampicillin, benzylpenicillin and imipenem showed higher affinity for PBPs 3 / 4 and PBP 5 than <b>cefozopran,</b> and their MICs {{were lower than}} that of <b>cefozopran.</b> No correlation between MICs of the test compounds and the affinity for PBP 1, 2 or 6 was found. These results suggest that <b>cefozopran</b> exhibits antimicrobial activity against E. faecalis TN 2 OO 5 by binding to PBP 5...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} {{reported that the}} Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates from clinical failure cases treated with cefdinir and aztreonam, β-lactams exhibited high MICs. These resistant isolates were clearly separated from the isolates exhibiting {{a low level of}} resistance to β-lactams as shown by the MIC distribution of <b>cefozopran.</b> Restriction fragment length polymorphism DNA typing revealed that the outbreak of cefozopran-resistant isolates in Kitakyushu, Japan, occurred as a result of clonal spread...|$|E
40|$|Three {{types of}} multiple-drug-resistant mutants which were phenotypically similar to {{previously}} described nalB, nfxB, and nfxC mutants were isolated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO 1 and two clinical isolates. Type 1 (nalB-type) mutants showed cross-resistance to meropenem, cephems, and quinolones. They overproduced an outer membrane protein with an apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa (OprM). Type 2 (nfxB-type) mutants showed cross-resistance to quinolones and new cephems, i. e., cefpirome and <b>cefozopran,</b> concomitant with overproduction of an outer membrane protein with an apparent molecular mass of 54 kDa (OprJ). Type 3 (nfxC-type) mutants showed cross-resistance to carbapenems and quinolones. They produced decreased amounts of OprD and increased amounts of a 50 -kDa protein (OprN), which {{was almost the}} same molecular weight as that of OprM, but it was distinguishable from OprM by its heat modifiability on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In the presence of salicylate, the parent strains showed an increased level of resistance to carbapenems and quinolones and produced decreased amounts of OprD and increased amounts of OprN. Salicylate caused the repression of OprJ production {{and the loss of}} resistance to cefpirome and <b>cefozopran</b> in two of the three OprJ-overproducing mutants, although salicylate slightly increased the level of resistance in the parent strains. The changes in susceptibilities were transient in the presence of salicylate. These data suggest that at least three different outer membrane proteins, OprM, OprJ, and OprN, are associated with multiple drug resistance in P. aeruginosa...|$|E

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Background and Objectives <b>Cefozopran</b> is a parenteral cephalosporin {{with a broad}} spectrum of activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the pharmacokinetics of cef-ozopran after single- and multiple-dose intravenous administration in healthy subjects, to provide clinical guidance in its application. Methods This was a single-center, open-label, random-ized, two-phase study conducted in 12 subjects.

40|$|The C- 3 ' {{quaternary}} ammonium cephems belong to group IV of the microbiological classification of cephalosporins. This group {{is divided into}} two subgroups according to the position of the {{quaternary ammonium}} moiety (C- 3 or C- 7). These compounds are structurally related to the third-generation cephalosporins (or group III of the microbiological classification), but in addition are featured with two {{or more of the following}} properties: broad-spectrum activity including Pseudomonas aeruginosa; activity against Enterobacteriaceae producing type 1 β-lactamase; the presence of a quaternary moiety. The zwitterionic properties of the C- 3 ' quaternary cephalosporins allow rapid penetration through the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, stability to and low affinity for type 1 β-lactamases in the periplasmic space and high affinity for the penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). Among the currently available analogues cefpirome and <b>cefozopran</b> exhibit a well-balanced antibacterial spectrum against Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci. Cefepime is less active against Staphylococcus aureus...|$|E
40|$|Expression of the multidrug efflux system MexC-MexD-OprJ in nfxB mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{contributes}} to resistance to fluoroquinolones and the “fourth-generation” cephems (cefpirome and <b>cefozopran),</b> {{but not to}} most β-lactams, including the ordinary cephems (ceftazidime and cefoperazone). nfxB mutants also express a second multidrug efflux system, MexA-MexB-OprM, due to incomplete transcriptional repression of this operon by the mexR gene product. To characterize {{the contribution of the}} MexC-MexD-OprJ system to drug resistance in P. aeruginosa, a site-specific deletion method was employed to remove the mexA-mexB-oprM region from the chromosome of wild-type and nfxB strains of P. aeruginosa. Characterization of mutants lacking the mexA-mexB-oprM region clearly indicated that the MexC-MexD-OprJ efflux system is involved in resistance to the ordinary cephems as well as fluoroquinolones and the fourth-generation cephems but not to carbenicillin and aztreonam. Rabbit polyclonal antisera and murine monoclonal antibody against the components of the MexA-MexB-OprM system were prepared and used to demonstrate the reduced production of this efflux system in the nfxB mutants. Consistent with this, transcription of the mexA-mexB-oprM operon decreased in an nfxB mutant. This reduction appears to explain the hypersusceptibility of the nfxB mutant to β-lactams, including ordinary cephems...|$|E
40|$|Various Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO 1 NfxB mutants were {{isolated}} on agar plates containing cefpirome and ofloxacin. They were classified into type A and type B, {{based on the}} degrees of changes in their susceptibilities. Type A mutants were four to eight times more resistant to ofloxacin, erythromycin, and new zwitterionic cephems, i. e., cefpirome, cefclidin, <b>cefozopran,</b> and cefoselis, than was the parent strain, PAO 1. In contrast, type B mutants were more resistant to tetracycline and chloramphenicol, as well as ofloxacin, erythromycin, and the new zwitterionic cephems, than was PAO 1, and they were four to eight times more susceptible to carbenicillin, sulbenicillin, imipenem, panipenem, biapenem, moxalactam, aztreonam, gentamicin, and kanamycin that was PAO 1. The changes in susceptibilities of type B mutants were greater than those of type A mutants. The susceptibilities of both type A and type B mutants were restored {{to the level of}} PAO 1 by transformation with plasmid pNF 111, which contained the wild-type nfxB gene, demonstrating that they are NfxB mutants. Immunoblot analysis with a monoclonal antibody to OprJ revealed that type B mutants produced larger amounts of outer membrane protein OprJ than did type A mutants and that PAO 1 produced an undetectable amount of it. Moreover, transconjugants obtained with the different types of NfxB mutants as the donor strains showed almost the same phenotypes as the corresponding donor strains. These results suggest that {{there are at least two}} nfxB mutations that show different phenotypes and that production of OprJ is associated with changes in susceptibilities of NfxB mutants...|$|E
