5000|$|Arc {{discharges}} at {{the atmospheric}} pressure are self-sustained DC [...] electric discharges with large electric currents, typically higher than 1 A, {{in some cases}} reaching up to 100.000 A, and relatively low voltages, typically {{of the order of}} 10 - 100 V. Due to high collision frequencies of plasma species, atmospheric pressure arcs are in thermal equilibrium having temperatures of the order of 6.000 - 12.000 C. Most of the arc volume is electrically neutral except for thin anode and cathode layers where strong electric fields are present. These typically collision-less layers have voltage drops of about 10 - 20 V. Ions, which are produced within the <b>cathode</b> <b>layer,</b> accelerate in this voltage and impact the cathode surface with high energies. This process heats the cathode stimulating thermal electron emission, which sustains the high discharge currents. On the cathode surface the electric currents concentrate at fast moving spots with sizes of 1 - 100 µm. Within these spots, the cathode material reaches local temperatures of 3000 C, leading to its evaporation and a slow cathode erosion.|$|E

A further increase of the electrochemical performance was obtained by increasing the grain size of the outer cathode current collector layer: the highest performance was achieved with non-ground LSM powder. In addition, {{it was found that the}} thickness of the <b>cathode</b> functional <b>layer</b> and <b>cathode</b> current collector <b>layer</b> also affects the electrochemical performance, whereas no obvious detrimental effects occurred with the different qualities of YSZ powder for the <b>cathode</b> functional <b>layer.</b> The highest performance, i. e. 1. 50 +/- 0. 05 A cm(- 2) at 800 degrees C and 700 mV, was obtained with a <b>cathode</b> functional <b>layer,</b> characterised by an LSM/YSZ mass ratio of 50 / 50, a d(90) of the LSM powder of 1. 0 mu m, non-calcined YSZ powder, and a thickness of about 30 mu m, and a <b>cathode</b> current collector <b>layer,</b> characterised by d(90) of the LSM powder of 26. 0 mu m (non-ground), and a thickness of 50 - 60 mu m.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the development of a three-dimensional computational model of water transport phenomena in the <b>cathode</b> catalyst <b>layer</b> (CCL) of PEMFCs. The catalyst layer in the numerical simulation was developed using the optimized sphere packing algorithm. The optimization technique named the adaptive random search technique (ARSET) was employed in this packing algorithm. The ARSET algorithm will generate the initial location of spheres and allow them to move in the random direction with the variable moving distance, randomly selected from the sampling range, based on the Lennard-jones potential of the current and new configuration. The solid fraction values obtained from this developed algorithm are in the range of 0. 631 to 0. 6384 while the actual processing time can significantly be reduced by 8 % to 36 % {{based on the number of}} spheres. The initial random number sampling range was investigated and the appropriate sampling range value is equal to 0. 5. This numerically developed <b>cathode</b> catalyst <b>layer</b> has been used to simulate the diffusion processes of protons, in the form of hydronium, and oxygen molecules through the <b>cathode</b> catalyst <b>layer.</b> The movements of hydroniums and oxygen molecules are controlled by the random vectors and all of these moves has to obey the Lennard-Jones potential energy constrain. Chemical reaction between these two species will happen when they share the same neighborhood and result in the creation of water molecules. Like hydroniums and oxygen molecules, these newly-formed water molecules also diffuse through the <b>cathode</b> catalyst <b>layer.</b> It is important to investigate and study the distribution of hydronium oxygen molecule and water molecules during the diffusion process in order to understand the lifetime of the <b>cathode</b> catalyst <b>layer.</b> The effect of fuel flow rate on the water distribution has also been studied by varying the hydronium and oxygen molecule input. Based on the results of these simulations, the hydronium: oxygen input ratio of 3 : 2 has been found to be the best choice for this study. To study the effect of metal impurity and gas contamination on the <b>cathode</b> catalyst <b>layer,</b> the <b>cathode</b> catalyst <b>layer</b> structure is modified by adding the metal impurities and the gas contamination is introduced with the oxygen input. In this study, gas contamination has very little effect on the electrochemical reaction inside the <b>cathode</b> catalyst <b>layer</b> because this simulation is transient in nature and the percentage of the gas contamination is small, in the range of 0. 0005 % to 0. 0015 % for CO and 0. 028 % to 0. 04 % for CO 2. Metal impurities seem to have more effect on the performance of PEMFC because they not only change the structure of the developed <b>cathode</b> catalyst <b>layer</b> but also affect the movement of fuel and water product. Aluminum has the worst effect on the <b>cathode</b> catalyst <b>layer</b> structure because it yields the lowest amount of newly form water and the largest amount of trapped water product compared to iron of the same impurity percentage. For the iron impurity, it shows some positive effect on the life time of the <b>cathode</b> catalyst <b>layer.</b> At the 0. 75 wt% of iron impurity, the amount of newly formed water is 6. 59 % lower than the pure carbon catalyst layer case but the amount of trapped water product is 11. 64 % lower than the pure catalyst layer. The lifetime of the impure <b>cathode</b> catalyst <b>layer</b> is longer than the pure one because the amount of water that is still trapped inside the pure <b>cathode</b> catalyst <b>layer</b> is higher than that of the impure one. Even though the impure <b>cathode</b> catalyst <b>layer</b> has a longer lifetime, it sacrifices the electrical power output because the electrochemical reaction occurrence inside the impure catalyst layer is lower...|$|R

40|$|In {{arc welding}} {{the quality of}} the weld is {{strongly}} influenced by the thermal history of the workpiece which is itself governed by the electric arc heat source. The models for predicting weld properties thus need a good evaluation of the distribution of the heat input from the arc to the workpiece. To have a predictive model of arc heat source it is necessary {{to take into account the}} cathode and its coupling with the plasma. The coupling allows to calculate the temperature and current density distributions along the cathode surface rather than prescribing them. This thesis focuses on the arc-cathode coupling for a plasma assumed to be in local thermal equilibrium. A self-consistent coupling boundary model for high-intensity electric arc on a refractory cathode (thoriated tungsten) was developed accounting for the physics of the sub-layers of the <b>cathode</b> <b>layer</b> and the non-uniformity of the cathode surface physical state. The <b>cathode</b> <b>layer</b> model accounts for the non-equilibria in the <b>cathode</b> <b>layer.</b> It was tested in one-dimensional calculations and then extended to a cathode-plasma coupling boundary condition for gas tungsten arc implemented in OpenFOAM. Different modelling assumptions commonly used for developing the model were questioned and investigated. It was checked that the secondary electron emission is negligible compared to the effect of emitted electrons and ions. It was verified that it is justified to neglect the space charge of emitted electron when calculating the cathode surface electric field. It was verified that Richardson-Dushman electron emission law supplemented with Schottky correction is used within its domain of validity in GTA applications even for low work function emitters.

Electrolyte layer of 8 YSZ (8 mol % yittria stabilized zirconia) is employed by dip-coating an anode honeycomb substrate of Ni/YSZ, followed by being coated with <b>cathode</b> <b>layer</b> of La 0. 7 Sr 0. 3 MnO 3. Current-voltage and current-power density {{characteristics of the}} cells having different anode and cathode flow channel configurations at 850 ℃ were measured. The results show promising performances of the cell {{as a starting point}} to develop stacks composed of multiple honeycomb cells...|$|E
40|$|Thin <b>cathode</b> <b>layers</b> of 200 nm {{thickness}} of Mg-Al and Mg-Al-Zr alloys and pure Zr were formed on glass substrates using a magnetron sputtering technique. X-ray diffraction and {{atomic force microscopy}} were used for structure and morphology analysis of magnetron sputtered alloys. The corrosion resistance of the sputtered Mg-Al and Mg-Al-Zr coatings in 0. 1 M (NH 4) 3 BO 3 and 0. 1 M NaCl solution (pH = 8. 6), was evaluated according to anodic polarization behavior.

40|$|The {{synchrotron}} based scanning transmission soft X-ray microscopy (STXM) utilizing {{near edge}} X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) {{is a novel}} technique for characterization of membrane electrode assembly (MEA) components in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). Component maps for carbon support, Pt and ionomer in the <b>cathode</b> catalyst <b>layer</b> and perfluorosulphonic acid (PFSA) membrane including the reinforced layer have been obtained from full C 1 s multi-energy image sequences and maps from images at four energies in the C 1 s and F 1 s regions. The ability of this technique to distinguish both structural and chemical differences in <b>cathode</b> catalyst <b>layers</b> from two significantly different designs has been demonstrated. The ionomer distribution in the <b>cathode</b> catalyst <b>layer</b> of an advanced catalyst coated membrane (CCM) structure is {{compared to that of}} the cathode in a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) ...|$|R
