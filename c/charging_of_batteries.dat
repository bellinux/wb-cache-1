50|$|The Rosenberg {{generator}} is {{very similar}} to the Metadyne generator, both in its construction and its electrical connection. It generally does not have a compensation winding, so that the whole of the armature reaction opposes the initial excitation. Parts of the magnetic circuit are normally not laminated, which creates delays between excitations and fluxes, but the machines are used in applications where a quick response is not essential. Their predominant use has been in trains, where they are axle-driven, and used to provide lighting and the <b>charging</b> <b>of</b> <b>batteries.</b> An axle-driven generator is subject to variable speeds and changes in the direction of rotation, but the characteristics of the machine allow it to produce useful energy down to very low speeds. At slow speeds, the output voltage increases with the square of the speed, but the magnetic circuit soon becomes saturated, resulting in much smaller increases as the speed increases. When used in circuits which include batteries charged from the output, a rectifier or reverse-current cut-out is normally required to prevent discharge of the batteries through the generator at very low speeds, or when the train stops.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Solar {{energy is}} a vital that can make {{environment}} friendly energy more flexible and commercially widespread. As Sun is not available the whole day and during cloudy days, storage of electricity is required. Storage batteries are expensive {{and so are the}} solar photovoltaic (PV) panels. Hence, it is imperative that each stand-alone PV system is suitably designed depending on load (resistive) and autonomy requirements. In this work, 2 KW to 5 KW stand-alone photovoltaic systems for variable load requirements for <b>charging</b> <b>of</b> <b>batteries</b> is studied.

40|$|Electric {{vehicles}} (EV’s) {{are yet to}} be seen as {{a serious}} “green ” alternative to traditional gasoline vehicles for a number of reasons. One of the main issues is the limited range of the batteries due to their low capacity. The issue is being addressed at several levels as there is research regarding increased battery capacity at several universities and companies. However until larger batteries are available an alternative has to be provided. The company Better Place is building battery replacement stations so that users can replace their empty battery with a fully charged in less than 5 minutes.

A different option is to actively involve users in the charging process by letting them interact directly with the virtual power plant(VPP’s).

The series connected boost converter topology is discussed and several advantages over existing technologies are illustrated. Besides being small, lightweight, and efficient, this topology has the added benefit of inherent fault tolerance. A positive ground power system test bed has been developed for the TROPIX spacecraft program. Performance of the SCBC in the test bed is described in detail.

This IPT system should in the future be implemented in Aros Electronics self-balancing robot Glenn. The system can transfer 153 W over a 3 cm air gap with an efficiency of 84. 5 %.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a low voltage-stress AC-linked charge equalizing system for balancing the energy in a serially connected, valve-regulated {{lead acid battery}} string using a modular converter that consists of multiple transformers coupled together. Each converter was coupled through an AC- linked bus to increase the overall energy transfer efficiency {{of the system and}} to eliminate the problem of the unbalanced <b>charging</b> <b>of</b> <b>batteries.</b> Previous solutions are based on centralized and modularized topologies. A centralized topology requires a redesign of the hardware and related components. It also faces a high voltage stress when the number of batteries is expanded. Modularized solutions use low-voltage-stress, double-stage, DC-linked topologies which leads to poor energy transfer efficiency. The proposed solution uses a low-voltage stress, AC-linked, modularized topology that makes adding more batteries easier. It also has a better energy transfer efficiency. To ensure that the charge equalization system operates smoothly and safely charges batteries, a small intelligent microcontroller was used in the control section. The efficiency of this charge equalization system is 85 %, which is 21 % better than other low-voltage-stress DC-linked charging techniques.

40|$|Electrical {{resistance}} {{of both the}} electrodes of a lead-acid battery increases during discharge due to formation of lead sulfate, an insulator. Work of Metzendorf 1] shows that resistance increases sharply at about 65 % conversion of active materials, and battery stops discharging once this critical conversion is reached. However, these aspects are not incorporated into existing mathematical models. Present work uses the results of Metzendorf 1], and develops a model that includes the effect of variable resistance. Further, it uses a reasonable expression {{to account for the}} decrease in active area during discharge instead of the empirical equations of previous work. The model's predictions are compared with observations of Cugnet et al. 2]. The model is as successful as the non-mechanistic models existing in literature. Inclusion of variation in {{resistance of}} electrodes in the model is important if one of the electrodes is a limiting reactant. If active materials are stoichiometrically balanced, resistance of electrodes can be very large at the end of discharge but has only a minor effect on <b>charging</b> <b>of</b> <b>batteries.</b> The model points to the significance of electrical conductivity of electrodes in the charging of deep discharged batteries.

40|$|The <b>charging</b> <b>of</b> <b>batteries</b> of plug-in hybrid {{electric}} vehicles {{at home at}} standard outlets {{has an impact on}} the distribution grid which may require serious investments in grid expansion. The coordination of the charging gives an improvement of the grid exploitation in terms of reduced power losses and voltage deviations with respect to uncoordinated charging. The vehicles must be dispatchable to achieve the most efficient solution. As the exact forecasting of household loads is not possible, stochastic programming is introduced. Two main techniques are analyzed in this paper: quadratic and dynamic programming. Both techniques are compared in results and storage requirements. The charging can be coordinated directly or indirectly by the grid utility or an aggregator who will sell the aggregated demand of PHEVs at the utility. PHEVs can also discharge and so inject energy in the grid to restrict voltage drops. The amount of energy that is injected in the grid depends on the price tariffs, the charging and discharging efficiencies and the battery energy content. The impact of a voltage controller embedded in a PHEV charger is regarded in this paper. A day and night tariff are applied. The charging and discharging of vehicles can respond to real-time pricing or on a price-schedule as well.

40|$|My {{research}} {{has been focused on}} characterization and control of the interfacial processes in advanced electrochem. systems presented by solid acid fuel cells (SAFC) and Li ion batteries. The performance of these electrochem. systems is closely related to the processes occurring at the interface of electrodes and electrolytes. The electrocatalysis at the interface of the super-protonic (at 245 °C) CsH_ 2 PO_ 4 solid acid and electrodes occurs at active sites which are also accessible to the humidified gases. Pt remains the best catalyst for both H_ 2 oxidn. and O_ 2 redn. reactions in the anodes and cathodes of the solid acid fuel cells. Since the electrocatalysis of the H_ 2 → H+ is an efficient process at 245 °C, the structure of the interface {{plays a major role in}} overall performance of the anodes. 3 D nanostructures of carbon nanotubes decorated carbon fibers coated with Pt provide an efficient contact between electrolyte, Pt coatings, and H_ 2 gas. Interestingly, the activity of such structures correlates with the film thickness, where thinner films show higher activity. On the cathode side, because of the strong O=O bond, oxygen redn. is a slow reaction even on a Pt surface at 245 °C, requiring high loadings of the precious Pt catalyst. Solid state TiO_ 2 catalysts are an attractive alternative. The activity of the TiO_ 2 films grown on Ti metal under slightly oxidizing environment at elevated temp. (600 - 900 °C) is controlled by the phase and thickness of the films. Thinner films with more rutile phase show higher activity. In Li ion batteries, our anal. shows high mol. wt. oligomerized species are formed as a part of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Nature of the formed SEI and degree of oligomerization can be controlled by using electrolyte additives such as vinylene carbonate and Vinyl ethylene carbonate. Interfacial and bulk mech. effects also play a major role in capacity retention, and battery performance. Advanced Sn based anodes, depending on their SnO_x content, exhibit significant changes in compressive and tensile surface stresses which directly influences their performance. In graphite anodes, our anal. shows that the mech. effects scale with the charging rate, which explains the chemo-mech. degrdn. effects common during fast <b>charging</b> <b>of</b> <b>batteries...</b>|$|E

40|$|Antennas are {{traditionally}} designed for far-field {{applications such as}} wireless communications, radar, etc., where the antenna systems interact with other systems and objects which {{are located in the}} far-field zone of the antennas. For this reason, the characterization of antennas in the far-field is well-defined and measurable by well-developed measurement techniques both in line-of-sight and multipath environments. However, with the recent increase in applications for near-field microwave systems such as in detection and sensing, wireless power transfer or near-field communication, {{there is a need for}} the study of design criteria of antennas tailored for near-field applications. This thesis addresses some aspects of this topic. In order to assess the antenna's ability to transfer power to a desired target in the near-field, penetration ability is introduced and investigated besides the directivity which is a far-field characteristic. It can be demonstrated that these near-field and far-field characteristics are not explicitly correlated and that the penetration ability is dependent on the depth of interest in the near-field as well as the loss in the medium. The axial pattern cannot be defined and used in lossy media since in the presence of loss, the field intensity is affected by a monotonous attenuation with distance from the antenna. The 3 dB near-field beam radius is introduced as a measure to characterize the antenna's focusing behavior in lossy media in the near-field and it is further used to find an optimal size of the uniform field apertures for the near-field detection of foreign objects in lossy media. In the final part, array signal processing techniques are applied to the transmitting aperture field modes in order to determine the optimal aperture distribution that maximizes the power transmission through lossy media. The optimal apertures which are determined by this method are applicable in many near-field systems, such as the detection of foreign objects in lossy matters (e. g. food contamination detectors), wireless <b>charging</b> <b>of</b> <b>batteries</b> of human body implanted devices, and for near-field communication systems.

40|$|Wireless sensors are an {{emerging}} technology {{that has the}} potential to revolutionize the monitoring of simple and complex physical systems. One of the biggest challenges with wireless sensors technology is power management and hence cost. A wireless sensor system incapable of managing its power consumption either by maintaining long battery life and/or harvesting from its surroundings, is simply not cost effective. Prolonging or eliminating the battery entirely would reduce the cost of battery replacement and maintenance. A viable family of materials for this purpose is piezoelectric materials because of their inherent ability to convert vibrations into electrical energy. Currently, a wide variety of piezoelectric materials are available and the appropriate choice for harvesting energy depends on their characteristics and properties. In addition to the material choice, energy harvesting circuitry is needed to efficiently convert and filter the signal from the piezoelectric device into a form that can be used by a load (battery). This thesis addresses the theoretical and experimental use of a type of pre-stressed PZT- 5 A Unimorph called a Thunder® to actively convert mechanical vibrations into useable power. Two types of devices of Thunder diaphragms are used: (1) a composite made of stainless steel, plain polyimide, a piezoelectric layer, plain polyimide, and copper; (2) and a second composite made with the same materials except that micro nickel inclusions are suspended into the polyimide layer. The first type produced a maximum average power of 2, 585 μW (~ 2. 6 mW) with a power density of 1411 μW/cm 2 (~ 1. 4 mW). The maximum total energy was 541, 114 μJ (~ 0. 54 J). The second type produced a maximum average power of 3, 800 μW (~ 3. 8 mW) with a power density of 2, 073 μW/cm 2 (~ 2 mW/cm 2). The maximum total energy produced 1, 187, 939 μJ (~ 1. 19 J). Based on these energy calculations, it was found that a plain polyimide diaphragm could theoretically charge a 1000 mA-hr battery in a range from 3. 32 hours to 32. 32 hours depending on the energy harvesting circuit while nickel polyimide diaphragm could charge it in a range from 3. 38 hours to 20. 01 hours. These results show that THUNDER can effectively generate power from a steady sinusoidal source at frequencies below 10 Hz for the <b>charging</b> <b>of</b> <b>batteries</b> or for directly powering a device...|$|E
