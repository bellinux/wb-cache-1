40|$|The {{effectiveness}} <b>of</b> <b>self-regulation</b> {{to promote}} corporate social responsibility, with <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> conduct as most common means, {{continues to be}} the subject of widespread interest. This article explores the effectiveness <b>of</b> corporate <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> conduct, focusing on the issue of child labour. This issue is all the more pronounced, because a strict approach, involving firing child workers or terminating relationships with suppliers that employ them, does not change underlying causes. Effectiveness is explored by a close examination of the nature <b>of</b> child labour <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> six pioneering international garment companies, and by a survey among a focus group of opinion leaders in companies and stakeholders, who were asked for their views on the different dilemmas surrounding codes and child labour. Overall, our research shows that corporate codes are considered to be important, though not the only instruments for addressing child labour. Possible negative side effects and limitations <b>of</b> <b>codes</b> are not seen as crucial factors that harm their effectiveness. Codes must be specific, strictly implemented and monitored, and combined with alternative arrangements for under-age child workers. The importance of a supply-chain approach and attention for the host-country context is recognized.

40|$|Promotional {{competitions}} are competitions {{in which}} prizes are awarded by lot or chance {{in order to}} promote goods or services. In order to protect participants and consumers against abuse, these competitions are usually regulated by gambling or consumer protection legislation. However, the relevant legislation is often complemented by self-regulation, which is the focus <b>of</b> this contribution. <b>Self-regulation</b> entails the regulation or governing of an industry by the role players in that industry. This article commences by explaining the relevant terminology and exploring self-regulation in general, including the various forms <b>of</b> <b>self-regulation</b> and the binding force thereof. The nature <b>of</b> <b>self-regulation</b> is discussed together with the advantages and challenges associated with this form of regulation. This is followed by some examples <b>of</b> <b>self-regulation</b> on a global level in order to provide a comparative perspective on the topic. The provisions of the International Chamber <b>of</b> Commerce's Consolidated <b>Code</b> <b>of</b> Advertising and Marketing Communications Practice are summarised and the European Advertising Standards Alliance's role in self-regulation is considered. Attention is also given to the relevant industry codes in the United Kingdom in view of the comprehensive way in which promotional competitions are covered by self-regulation in that country. The main part of the article centres on the self-regulatory position in South Africa. A brief overview of the role and function of the Advertising Standards Authority of South Africa (ASASA) is provided.

40|$|Purpose – Electronic {{commerce}} or e-commerce {{constitutes a}} commercial {{activity on the}} rise. Although it has many advantages, there are several lingering factors that prevent its consolidation, such as the lack of trust of the potential consumer/user. In order to overcome that obstacle, instruments <b>of</b> <b>self-regulation</b> were created {{in the field of}} advertising. Firms that wish to distinguish themselves favorably against their competitors have the option of adopting those instruments, which play a praiseworthy role regarding the target audience and constitutes a considerable improvement of consumer rights. However, on occasions, problems arise in the market when those systems <b>of</b> <b>self-regulation</b> bind third parties that did not voluntarily enter into a contract.

We can frequently observe the symptoms of institutionalisation in these groups of children and adolescents, which is a major obstacle to their functional <b>self-regulation</b> <b>of</b> behaviour and to their return to the natural social environment. The research sample was comprised of 2, 776 children and adolescents from the natural and institutional environment in the Czech Republic (children and adolescents living in total institutions such as correctional institutions for children and minors and children's homes). The Self-regulation Questionnaire (SRQ) used in the study contained 12 items aimed at 3 areas <b>of</b> <b>self-regulation</b> <b>of</b> behaviour: Affect, Awareness and Empowerment. The results have shown that the level <b>of</b> <b>self-regulation</b> <b>of</b> behaviour is lower among children in the institutional environment. We recorded the most significant differences between children from the institutional and natural environment in the area of Affect (i. e. the regulation of emotions). It means that children and adolescents from institutional environments have more trouble controlling their emotions than children from a natural environment. We also found that the level <b>of</b> <b>self-regulation</b> <b>of</b> behaviour is dependent on the perceived level of problematic behaviour of children and adolescents. A higher level of problematic behaviour of children and adolescents indicates a lower level <b>of</b> <b>self-regulation</b> <b>of</b> their behaviour.
