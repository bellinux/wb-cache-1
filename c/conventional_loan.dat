50|$|This {{structure}} has some advantages over {{the structure of}} a <b>conventional</b> <b>loan.</b> Most importantly, payments to the merchant cash advance company fluctuate directly with the merchant's sales volumes, giving the merchant greater flexibility with which to manage their cash flow, particularly during a slow season. Advances are processed quicker than a typical loan, giving borrowers quicker access to capital. Also, because MCA providers like typically give more weight to the underlying performance of a business than the owner’s personal credit scores, merchant cash advances offer an alternative to businesses who may not qualify for a <b>conventional</b> <b>loan.</b> An example transaction is as follows: A business sells $25,000 of a portion of its future credit card sales for an immediate $20,000 lump sum payment from a finance company. The finance company then collects its portion (generally 15-35%) from every credit card and/or debit card sale until the entire $25,000 is collected.|$|E
50|$|Loans - Loans may be low- or no-interest contributions. Financing {{methods and}} {{repayment}} requirements vary from <b>conventional</b> <b>loan</b> arrangements to {{situations in which}} the business fronts the costs, submits the costs to the agency, receives reimbursement for all or {{a portion of the}} costs, and then at a pre-determined date, the business begins to pay back the loan.

50|$|If a {{borrower}} has poor {{to moderate}} credit history, MMI probably {{is much less}} expensive with an FHA insured loan than with a <b>conventional</b> <b>loan</b> regardless of LTV - sometimes as little as one-ninth as much depending on the borrower's credit score, LTV, loan size, and approval status. Conventional mortgage insurance rates increase as credit scores decrease, whereas FHA mortgage insurance rates do not vary with credit score. Conventional mortgage premiums spike dramatically if the borrower's credit score is lower than 620. Due to a sharply increased risk, most mortgage insurers will not write policies if the borrower's credit score is less than 575. When insurers do write policies for borrowers with lower credit scores, annual premiums may {{be as high as}} 5% of the loan amount.|$|E

We find robust evidence that the default rate on Islamic loans {{is less than half}} the default rate on <b>conventional</b> <b>loans.</b> The evidence comes from a variety of specifications that contain pertinent combinations of time-varying borrower, loan contract and bank characteristics, and time, borrower, bank and borrower*bank fixed effects. For the same borrower taking both <b>conventional</b> and Islamic <b>loans</b> from the same bank, the hazard rate on Islamic loans drops to one fifth the hazard rate on <b>conventional</b> <b>loans.</b> Islamic loans are less likely to default during Ramadan and in big cities if the share of votes to religious-political parties increases, suggesting that religion [...] either through individual piousness or network effects [...] {{may play a role in}} determining loan default.

50|$|The {{purpose of}} tax-exempt bonds, or private {{activity}} bonds, {{is to promote}} job creation and increase economic development in local areas; therefore, they {{are not limited to}} housing creation. These bonds are issued by state Housing Finance Agencies (similar to LIHTCs) or by local government development agencies. Since the interest on the bonds is exempt from state and local taxes, lenders who purchase the bonds pass on this savings onto borrowers through lower interest rates. Tax-exempt bonds are similar to <b>conventional</b> <b>loans</b> in that the borrower must pay back the principle plus interest to the lender; however, tax-exempt bonds typically have longer financing periods compared to <b>conventional</b> <b>loans.</b> In general, this type of bonding is utilized for projects over one million dollars.|$|R

Results: The main finding indicates that customers perceived the equity sharing features in diminishing partnership home financing mode differ from the <b>conventional</b> <b>loan</b> and other existing Islamic home financing modes.

40|$|Purchase {{of a house}} {{requires}} three interrelated household financial decisions: {{what level}} of debt to obtain, whether to select an adjustable or fixed rate mortgage (ARM or FRM) and whether to choose an FHA or a <b>conventional</b> <b>loan.</b> While some have analyzed the mortgage debt decision and the ARM/FRM choice, virtually no one has studied the FHA/conventional mortgage choice or the interrelation among the mortgage debt and instrument decisions. In our sample of 819 young home purchasers, debt and mortgage choice is driven by a need to finesse the downpayment and payment constraint ratios and to lower mortgage insurance costs. ...|$|E

However, households are not restricted to putting 20 percent down and choosing a fixed- rate loan. When we allow households to select the optimal LTV and mortgage type (adjustable or fixed-rate with Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or conventional insurance), the percentage of our sample that is credit constrained declines from 71 to 49. Moreover, the measured impact on the homeownership rate of the constraints falls to only 4 percentage points. Further, FHA loans are estimated to increase homeownership by only 0. 1 to 0. 2 percentage points. ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the assumable loan value in creative financing. It is shown that, even in perfect markets {{and with an}} identical risk assigned to first and secondary mortgages on the same house, the assumable loan value {{as determined by the}} cash equivalence method is overstated. The impact of unexpected changes in market interest rates will reduce the premium paid for the assumable loan. Furthermore, under efficient markets with transaction costs, homebuyers will not pay the value as indicated by traditional cash equivalence for the assumable loan. The buyer's expected payoff could instead be higher by taking a new <b>conventional</b> <b>loan</b> on the house. The result explains some empirical findings of studies using cash equivalence that have found capitalization rates less than 100 % of the assumable loan value into home selling prices.

40|$|Zorn, and seminar {{participants}} at MIT and West Virginia University for helpful comments. We also thank Glenn Canner {{for assistance in}} obtaining some of the data, and Shawn Rohlin and Michael Eriksen for excellent research assistance. Any errors are our own. Secondary markets for credit are widely believed to improve efficiency and increase access to credit. In part, {{this is because of}} their greater ability to manage risk. Nevertheless, the degree to which secondary markets expand access to credit is virtually unknown. Using the mortgage market as an example, we begin to fill that gap. Our conceptual model suggests that secondary credit markets have potentially ambiguous effects on interest rates, but unambiguous positive effects on the number of loans issued. We focus our empirical analysis on the latter using 1992 - 2004 HMDA files for conventional, conforming, home purchase loans in conjunction with Census tract data. Findings confirm that an active secondary market increases mortgage origination rates.

40|$|Globally, {{there has}} been a {{substantial}} {{increase in the number of}} people who are not able to buy their own dwellings due to the phenomenal appreciation of real estate prices. In line with this trend, a large proportion of the population in the KSA (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) also appears to have had neither the chance to own their chosen property nor benefit from the real estate appreciation. It seems that this situation has arisen because the financial system does not correspond to the non-traditional characteristics of their clientele. The cultural and religious heritage and the personal attitude towards borrowing are distinctly different in the KSA. These characteristics, which are explored in detail in this paper, affect how a client would engage with a financial institution in acquiring a loan/mortgage. Furthermore, the client's lifelong needs - such as upgrading the dwelling - are not addressed by the <b>conventional</b> <b>loan</b> system. This paper proposes a framework for lifelong (ongoing) financing to address these issues.
