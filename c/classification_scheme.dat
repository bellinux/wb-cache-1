40|$|Abstract <b>Classification</b> <b>schemes</b> are an {{important}} but still rather unexplored issue in the collective use of large document collections. We have investigated the classification of technical documentations in two engineering domains: a steel mill and a sewerage plant company. In both cases we found a coexistence of different <b>classification</b> <b>schemes</b> and problems resulting from distributed local archive. In supporting human actors to maintain different <b>classifications</b> <b>schemes</b> while working on a common archive, we developed the concept of context grabbing. It allows assigning context information efficiently {{in the form of}} metadata. Based on a document management system, a tool kit for context grabbing was developed. It was introduced into the sewerage work company to maintain different <b>classification</b> <b>schemes</b> on a shared archive...|$|R

Before this, Coolbrith had resisted library trustee attempts to classify the books; she had wished to continue the reading-room atmosphere that she had established.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, strombid {{gastropods}} {{were believed}} to be carnivores. This erroneous conception was based on the writings of French naturalist Jean Baptiste Lamarck, whose <b>classification</b> <b>scheme</b> grouped strombids with carnivorous sea snails. Subsequent studies have refuted the concept, proving beyond doubt that strombid gastropods are herbivorous animals. In common with other Strombidae, Laevistrombus canarium is known to be a herbivore, feeding on algae and occasionally detritus.|$|E
40|$|The content {{management}} systems (content {{management systems}}, CMS) are software packages that allow to create, publish, and archive digital content. On these platforms {{play a key}} role <b>classification</b> <b>schemes.</b> This work evaluates the implementation of features for <b>classification</b> <b>schemes</b> in these tools. To do this, we have defined a test method, and have been studied ten software packages, with the aim of determining the different types of <b>classification</b> <b>schemes</b> supported, in relation to the content that they manage. The evaluation was carried out by heuristic analysis, presence / absence of functionalities, and numerical indicators. The results have been collected in comparative tables.

5|$|In {{the early}} part of the 20th century, {{information}} about the types and distances of stars became more readily available. The spectra of stars were shown to have distinctive features, which allowed them to be categorized. Annie Jump Cannon and Edward C.

5|$|The first {{spectral}} {{classification of}} these distant supernovae {{was performed by}} Rudolph Minkowski in 1941. He categorized them into two types, based {{on whether or not}} lines of the element hydrogen appeared in the supernova spectrum. Zwicky later proposed additional types III, IV, and V, although these are no longer used and now appear to be associated with single peculiar supernova types. Further sub-division of the spectra categories resulted in the modern supernova <b>classification</b> <b>scheme.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{science of}} stellar {{spectroscopy}} was pioneered by Joseph von Fraunhofer and Angelo Secchi. By comparing the spectra of {{stars such as}} Sirius to the Sun, they found differences in the strength and number of their absorption lines—the dark lines in a stellar spectra caused by the atmosphere's absorption of specific frequencies. In 1865 Secchi began classifying stars into spectral types. However, the modern version of the stellar <b>classification</b> <b>scheme</b> was developed by Annie J. Cannon during the 1900s.|$|E
5|$|Conservation efforts {{include both}} land and species protection. Approximately 8.95km2 (equal to 3.4% of total land area) divided among 34 {{reserves}} are protected in Puerto Rico. According to the IUCN there are 21 threatened species in Puerto Rico: 2 mammals, 8 breeding birds, 8 reptiles, and 3 amphibians. The U.S. federal government lists 5 mammals, 2 amphibians, 8 birds, and 10 reptiles under the Federal Endangered Species Act. The Puerto Rican government, through the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DNER), produces its own threatened species list which includes 18 critically endangered species (3 amphibians, 7 birds, 3 reptiles, 2 fish and 3 invertebrates), and 14 endangered species. The DNER follows the IUCN <b>classification</b> <b>scheme</b> for species' priority assignment.|$|E
5|$|In the {{modified}} Hubble sequence galaxy morphological <b>classification</b> <b>scheme</b> of French astronomer Gérard de Vaucouleurs, M87 is categorized as an E0p galaxy. The E0 designation {{is used for}} an elliptical galaxy that displays no flattening—that is, it appears spherical. A 'p' suffix indicates a peculiar galaxy that does not fit cleanly into the classification scheme; in this case, the peculiarity denotes {{the presence of the}} jet emerging from the core. M87 is considered a type-cD galaxy, which is a supergiant D class galaxy. The latter category, first proposed by American astronomer William W. Morgan in 1958, is a galaxy that has an elliptical-like nucleus surrounded by an extensive, dustless, diffuse envelope.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the influence of}} ideological and scholarly-ethnographic <b>classification</b> <b>schemes,</b> {{as well as those}} pertaining to population censuses, on the formation of ethnic identities and ethnic structure in Civil Croatia and Slavonia from 1785 to 1860. Proceeding from the theory of social systems and institutions, the author examines the power of <b>classification</b> <b>schemes</b> and their influence on the construction of ethnic identities. It has been shown that changes in social orders also lead to changes in the principles of constructing <b>classification</b> <b>schemes.</b> Thus, in the modern social order, the combination of commonsensical, ideological, scholarly and official statistic <b>classification</b> <b>schemes</b> {{led to the creation of}} a specific ethno-nationalist discourse, which strongly influenced the formation of ethnic identities, overcoming traditional ethnic particularities and formation of modern ethnic communities on the territories of Civil Croatia and Slavonia in the early modern period...|$|R
5|$|Max Tegmark {{developed}} a four-part <b>classification</b> <b>scheme</b> {{for the different}} types of multiverses that scientists have suggested in various problem domains. An example of such a model is the chaotic inflation model of the early universe. Another is the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. Parallel worlds are generated {{in a manner similar to}} quantum superposition and decoherence, with all states of the wave function being realized in separate worlds. Effectively, the multiverse evolves as a universal wavefunction. If the Big Bang that created our multiverse created an ensemble of multiverses, the wave function of the ensemble would be entangled in this sense.|$|E

This was a romantic era of botanical explorers, intrepid plant hunters and gardener-botanists.

5|$|Ramaria {{botrytis}} {{was designated}} the type species of Ramaria in 1933 by Marinus Anton Donk. Modern molecular analysis indicates that Ramaria is a polyphyletic assemblage of species with clavarioid fruit bodies. According to the infrageneric <b>classification</b> <b>scheme</b> proposed by Marr and Stuntz, R.botrytis {{is included in}} the subgenus Ramaria, which includes species that have grooved spores, clamps present in the hyphae, and fruit bodies with a large, profusely branched cauliflower-like appearance. Phylogenetic analysis of nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA suggests that R.botrytis is closely related to R.rubripermanens and R.rubrievanescens, and that these species form a clade that is sister (sharing a recent common ancestor) to the false truffle genus Gautieria, the most derived group within the studied taxa.|$|E
