40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{influence}} of big rotation angles on the classical solution of analytical process. Close-range photogrammetry differs from traditional aerial photogrammetry, for the former usually adopts oblique photography or <b>convergent</b> <b>photography,</b> while the latter is similar to take vertical photos wherein the orientation elements are very small. In this paper, {{an exploration of the}} algorithm in every step of the analytical process from dependent relative orientation to absolute orientation is described. In order to emphasize the differences, contrasts will be made between the solution of the classical aerial photography and the algorithm of the close-range photogrammetry. A practical close-range photogrammetry experiment is presented to demonstrate this new algorithm. Through the example, it is pointed that with this new algorithm, the coordinates of the ground points and the exterior orientation can be accurately calculated. The results indicate that the algorithm deduced in this paper is applicable in the close-range photogrammetry with big rotation angle. 1...|$|E
40|$|Commercial digital photogrammetric {{software}} {{has been}} applied to <b>convergent</b> stereoscopic <b>photography</b> of human tooth replicas prepared to exhibit optical texture resulting in successful generation of 3 D coordinate data. Tooth replicas were imaged using a semi-metric 35 mm camera and f = 100 mm macro lens on extension bellows. Model precision was within acceptable limits of 12 μm or better for manual target matching and 21 μm or better for automatic image matching. Further improvement in optical texture is required to achieve automatic image matching precision comparable to that of manual target matching. Small errors in interior orientation parameters attributed to instability in the bellows as well as small errors in the relative orientation resulted in some systematic errors. The use of a fixed camera lens system is expected to reduce these errors. When combined with commercially available, moderately priced, digital SLR cameras this brings 3 D model generation closer to everyday clinical dental practice...|$|R

By conducting an inclusive design analysis, with reference to zoological street furniture, thesis content evaluates its effectiveness as an analytical tool, contributing to a heightened understanding of the topic to assist older and disabled people. With zoological gardens functioning as a societal microcosm, findings hold broad implications relating to the application of inclusivity ideals outside of a zoology framework. Research has been underpinned by a constructivist epistemology and interpretivist theoretical perspective. Case study research has been employed as the thesis research methodology, incorporating photography, interviews, and experiments, as <b>convergent</b> research methods. <b>Photography</b> {{has been used to}} document zoological street furniture, interviews have provided insights from subject experts, and experiments have gathered feedback from zoological garden visitors. Data collection took place at the Welsh Mountain Zoo, Chester Zoo, Edinburgh Zoo, and Belfast Zoo. Findings have shown that when general guidance for accessible street furniture provision is applied to zoological street furniture, nuanced environmental factors influence the relevance and assertion of inclusive design. This suggests that each inclusive design analysis is context dependant and that contextually aware reinterpretation of access guidance is required to form effective and accessible design solutions. Thesis content explains the unique nature of zoological street furniture accessibility in the United Kingdom to underline this intellectual position...|$|R
40|$|Non-carious {{cervical}} lesion’ (NCCL) is a {{term used}} to describe loss of hard tissue in the cervical one-third of teeth. NCCLs are commonly encountered in dental practice and frequently require clinical intervention. There are few reports of high quality mapping and monitoring of NCCLs, and dental practitioners currently have no reliable method for measuring and monitoring their progress. Improved understanding of the underlying causes and progression of NCCLs will rely on reliable and practical methods of mapping their topography and monitoring their progress. NCCLs on the facial surfaces of teeth can be easily imaged, either directly or on cast replicas, and therefore may be well suited to mapping using a photogrammetric approach. A preliminary investigation {{led to the development}} of a casting material that incorporated optical texture so that photogrammetric image-matching techniques could be utilized. Three-dimensional coordinate data for tooth replicas was successfully generated using the casting material, <b>convergent</b> stereoscopic <b>photography</b> and commercial digital photogrammetric software. Imaging was performed initially using a semi-metric 35 mm film camera, then a high-resolution digital SLR camera, and finally a fixed-base digital SLR stereo camera. The quality of the surface data and the capacity to align tooth surfaces was investigated. Two specific examples of NCCLs were mapped and monitored at baseline, 12 month and 24 month time periods. For the film camera and the single digital camera, the photogrammetric solutions were not highly stable, with systematic height errors of up to 80 μm attributed to unstable exterior orientation. However, for the fixed-base stereo camera, model precision was shown to be in the order of 13 μm and the accuracy of surfaces derived from automatic measurement was approximately 3 μm. The error associated with aligning independent measurements of tooth surfaces was approximately 17 μm. Change detection of the two NCCL surfaces was sensitive to 30 μm, with change ranging from 30 to 320 μm per annum for one surface and 30 to 70 μm per annum for the second surface. Different rates of change were clearly evident in different areas of the same surfaces. The replication, stereoimagery, photogrammetric processing, and detection of changes to the surfaces were shown to be reliable and convenient. The results of this investigation show that stereo-photogrammetric techniques can be applied to the mapping of NCCLs, and that the surfaces can be mapped at sufficient accuracy to enable change to be monitored. The two examples suggest that annual change detection studies will provide a clearer picture of the rate of progression and the geometry of progression and, in combination with other analytical techniques, a more detailed explanation of the natural history of non carious cervical lesions...|$|R
40|$|My {{experiments}} {{consider the}} manner in which different fabric surfaces and colours respond to, absorb and reflect projected patterns. As they take the format of photographs they present the concept of 'live' fabric and costume captured as printed surface pattern but not in the usual sense. Because the subject is a moving one, the patterns seems to appear, disappear, merge and spill out of or leave and return to the fabric and the body. This process contemplates the physicality of the fabric and the body albeit in a virtual reality. The photographs present a captured performance that includes material and costume design independently but only {{for the duration of the}} performance. In this sense the patterns are ephemeral in nature. Because the pattern movement is in real time and multi-dimensional the narrative is reiterated, supplemented, complimented and enhanced. <b>Convergent</b> <b>Photography</b> considers the development from traditional photographs to images produced using digital technologies and includes sound in their making. The practice involves combining digital technologies to transform what was formerly a static photographic space into a platform for experimentation. Projections of sound and motion triggered designs and imagery onto a range of surfaces including fabrics and the body, have the potential to mutate constantly because they are created by a live sonic input. The incorporation of digital elements activated by sonic and motion triggers that rapidly produce numerous visual iterations, turns the photo generation process into an interaction between the photographer, the digital elements, the use of the space and the live performativity and response of the costume, its fabric and the body. My PhD research differs from other digital mise-en-scene research in that the sound and motion activated visual iterations are created in real-time. Technological developments in both photography and computing are now facilitating the amalgamation of traditional photographic methodologies and genres with new forms of scientific enquiry linked to immersive digital environments. ...|$|E
