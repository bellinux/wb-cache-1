50|$|Cantaloupe soup is {{prepared}} with cantaloupe {{as a primary}} ingredient. It may be prepared in puréed form and is typically served chilled. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} muskmelon soup. Cantaloupe soup may be served as a first course or starter dish prior to a main course. The use of well-ripened cantaloupe can create an optimal texture and enhance the sweet flavor of the soup. Additional ingredients can include lime juice, lemon juice, apple juice, orange juice, salt, pepper, herbs such as mint or basil, cayenne pepper and balsamic vinegar. Spicy versions may be prepared using chili peppers. A cantaloupe soup recipe using one large cantaloupe melon, one-half <b>cup</b> <b>orange</b> <b>juice</b> and one-quarter cup of honey has 147 calories per one-cup serving.|$|E
5000|$|When {{cardinal}} utility is used, {{the magnitude}} of utility differences is treated as an ethically or behaviorally significant quantity. For example, suppose a <b>cup</b> of <b>orange</b> <b>juice</b> has utility of 120 utils, {{a cup of tea}} has a utility of 80 utils, and a cup of water has a utility of 40 utils. With cardinal utility, it can be concluded that the <b>cup</b> of <b>orange</b> <b>juice</b> is better than the cup of tea by exactly the same amount by which the cup of tea is better than the cup of water. One cannot conclude, however, that the cup of tea is two thirds as good as the cup of juice, because this conclusion would depend not only on magnitudes of utility differences, but also on the [...] "zero" [...] of utility. For example, if the [...] "zero" [...] of utility was located at -40, then a <b>cup</b> of <b>orange</b> <b>juice</b> would be 160 utils more than zero, a cup of tea 120 utils more than zero.|$|R

2500|$|Inuit {{often are}} {{relentless}} in making known {{that they are}} not like Qallunaat {{in the sense that they}} do not eat the same food and they are communal with their food. Qallunaat believe that the person who purchases the food is the owner of the food and is free to decide what happens to the food. Searles describes the Inuit perspective on food by saying that [...] "in the Inuit world of goods, foods as well as other objects associated with hunting, fishing, and gathering are more or less communal property, belonging not to individuals but to a larger group, which can include multiple households." [...] Food in an Inuit household is not meant to be saved for the family who has hunted, fished, gathered, or purchased it, but instead for anyone who is in need of it. Searles and his wife were visiting a family in Iqaluit and he asked for permission to have a <b>cup</b> of <b>orange</b> <b>juice.</b> This small gesture of asking was taken as offensive because Inuit do not consider food belonging to one person.|$|R
50|$|At lunch, Abe and Jill overhear a conversation; a {{woman says}} she will lose her {{children}} in a custody battle because of a seemingly unethical judge in family court. Abe is troubled by the injustice and, without telling Jill, decides to help the woman by murdering the judge. Abe reasons he's unlikely to be caught because he isn't {{involved in the case}} and, therefore, won't be suspected. Abe steals a key to the college's chemistry lab from Rita where he procures cyanide. He then discovers one of the judge's routines: an early morning jog followed by sipping a <b>cup</b> of <b>orange</b> <b>juice</b> on a bench in the local park. Abe puts the poison in an identical cup and exchanges the cups surreptitiously on the bench while the judge is reading a newspaper. He subsequently dies from cyanide poisoning. Abe feels reborn upon learning of the judge's death. He tells himself that he has finally done something worthwhile with his life by ridding the world of one evil man. Consequently, his mood improves dramatically. Abe and Jill's friendship then blossoms into a romance but Jill says nothing to her boyfriend, Roy (Jamie Blackley). However, Roy strongly suspects Jill is in love with Abe and breaks up with her.|$|R

Thirteen volunteers (nine healthy subjects and four stone formers) sequentially received distilled water, <b>orange</b> <b>juice,</b> or lemonade while on constant metabolic diet. Twenty-four-hour urine samples were collected for acid-base parameters and stone risk analysis. <b>Orange</b> <b>juice</b> but not lemonade provided alkali as evidenced by higher net gastrointestinal alkali absorption and higher urinary pH and citrate compared with control. Urinary calcium was not significantly different, but urinary oxalate was higher during the <b>orange</b> <b>juice</b> phase.

A commercial <b>orange</b> <b>juice</b> (COJ) was selected as a control, and colour-modified <b>orange</b> <b>juices</b> were prepared by adding red or green food dyes (ROJ and GOJ) that did not alter the flavour of the juice. A series of paired comparison tests were performed by 30 naive panellists to {{determine the influence of}} <b>orange</b> <b>juice</b> colour on flavour intensity, sweetness, and sourness. Then, 100 <b>orange</b> <b>juice</b> consumers were asked to rate expected liking of <b>orange</b> <b>juice</b> samples initially by visual evaluation and subsequently for actual liking upon consumption, using a labelled affective magnitude scale. Results: Results of pair comparison tests indicated that colour changes did not affect flavour intensity and sweetness, but the greenish hue (GOJ) significantly increased the perceived sourness. Results of the consumers’ study indicated significant differences in expected liking between the <b>orange</b> <b>juice</b> samples, with ROJ having the highest expected liking.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of microfluidization and ultrasonication processing techniques used in the industrial mercantile on the ascorbic acid concentration of <b>orange</b> <b>juice.</b> The research question was: “Is there a significant mean difference between the ascorbic acid concentrations in the fresh, microfluidized and ultrasonicated orange juices?” It is hypothesized that there should be a significant mean difference between the ascorbic acid concentration in the fresh, microfluidized and ultrasonicated <b>orange</b> <b>juices</b> since the microfluidization and ultrasonication dilute and shear the <b>orange</b> <b>juice</b> by removing and breaking down its particles which may reduce the ascorbic acid content. A common titration technique was used to calculate the ascorbic acid concentration in the <b>orange</b> <b>juices.</b> With the help of the reagents indophenol (blue colored indicator), metaphosphoric acid and ascorbic acid, standard values of ascorbic acid was collected to use in the formula which is used to determine the ascorbic acid concentration in the <b>orange</b> <b>juice.</b> By the use of indophenol in the titration, the color of the <b>orange</b> <b>juice</b> solution will turn into pink as the indophenol nullifies the ascorbic acid content in the <b>orange</b> <b>juice</b> solution. The volume of indophenol solution will be recorded in order to use in the formula which is to find the amount of ascorbic acid in the <b>orange</b> <b>juice.</b> Moreover, the blank trial and standardization data are recorded to be used in the same formula. The Anova results, P-value and graphical investigation accept the alternate hypothesis which suggests there should be a difference between average ascorbic acid concentrations of processed and unprocessed juices. The average concentration of ascorbic acid in the fresh <b>orange</b> <b>juice</b> was 4. 82 g/lt, the concentration of ascorbic acid in the microfluidized <b>orange</b> <b>juice</b> was 4. 10 g/lt and the concentration of ascorbic acid in the ultrasonicated <b>orange</b> <b>juice</b> was 3. 00 g/lt.
