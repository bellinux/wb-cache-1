In short, she could popularize while she could neither discover nor invent.|$|E

25|$|Of a {{firm and}} unselfish but abrupt and passionate disposition, Ashkenazi {{everywhere}} aroused the discontent and {{hatred of the}} rich and the scholarly. Extensive learning, keen intelligence, and exceptional linguistic attainments, all combined to make him one of the most distinguished men of his day. All his contemporaries, even those who knew him only {{as the head of the}} Klaus at Altona, unite in praising his profound learning, his astuteness, his <b>clearness</b> of exposition, which never degenerated into the subtleties of the pilpul, and his absolute disregard for the influence of money. He would suffer serious deprivation rather than accept pecuniary assistance; and this characteristic, interpreted by the wealthy of that day as obstinacy and arrogance, became to him a source of much suffering and enmity.|$|E
25|$|Glass is in {{widespread}} use {{largely due to}} the production of glass compositions that are transparent to visible light. In contrast, polycrystalline materials do not generally transmit visible light. The individual crystallites may be transparent, but their facets (grain boundaries) reflect or scatter light resulting in diffuse reflection. Glass does not contain the internal subdivisions associated with grain boundaries in polycrystals and hence does not scatter light {{in the same manner as}} a polycrystalline material. The surface of a glass is often smooth since during glass formation the molecules of the supercooled liquid are not forced to dispose in rigid crystal geometries and can follow surface tension, which imposes a microscopically smooth surface. These properties, which give glass its <b>clearness,</b> can be retained even if glass is partially light-absorbing—i.e., colored.|$|E
25|$|The main magical {{system of}} the series relies on a system of {{attributes}} which are inherent to every living creature. These attributes are transferable to and from both man and animal, so brawn from a dog can be transferred to a man. Once an individual gives an attribute to another, the giver loses that particular attribute until {{the death of the}} recipient. Each person can only give one endowment in their lifetime. Endowments include brawn (physical strength), grace (physical dexterity), wit (memory and <b>clearness</b> of thought), metabolism (speed at which the body's processes operate), glamor, voice, stamina, sight, hearing, smell, touch, taste, talent, will, bloodlust, and pain. The third and fourth last are more difficult to create and are only known by the Inkarrans. The last two are perverse in nature and were devised by the one true master of evil to strengthen her troops and torture the humans, specifically Fallion.|$|E
25|$|The responsa of the epoch {{came from}} various countries, and from schools having {{different}} tendencies, thus showing {{the position and}} the type of spiritual life in general and of Talmudic learning in particular, since all these factors prevailed in the different countries at the time. Especially noteworthy is the divergence between the French and the Spanish school in the twelfth century, the second half of this period. For the most part the rulings of this period receive their basis or their confirmation from a passage in the Talmud, and in this motivation the difference between the French and the Spanish exegesis of the Talmud is clearly shown. The Spanish school was the more logical, and strove for brevity and lucidity in the deduction of its rulings from the Talmud, while the French school was more dialectic, and frequently gave full play to casuistry at the expense of <b>clearness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Empedocles is {{considered}} the last Greek philosopher to write in verse and the surviving fragments of his teaching are from two poems, Purifications and On Nature. Empedocles was undoubtedly acquainted with the didactic poems of Xenophanes and Parmenides– allusions to the latter {{can be found in}} the fragments,– but he seems to have surpassed them in the animation and richness of his style, and in the <b>clearness</b> of his descriptions and diction. Aristotle called him the father of rhetoric, and, although he acknowledged only the meter as a point of comparison between the poems of Empedocles and the epics of Homer, he described Empedocles as Homeric and powerful in his diction. Lucretius speaks of him with enthusiasm, and evidently viewed him as his model. The two poems together comprised 5000 lines. About 550 lines of his poetry survive, although because ancient writers rarely mentioned which poem they were quoting, it is not always certain to which poem the quotes belong. Some scholars now believe that there was only one poem, and that the Purifications merely formed the beginning of On Nature.|$|E
25|$|Penniman {{had more}} than the {{ordinary}} intellectual endowment; bold, striking, and original in her conceptions, and of singular facility and <b>clearness</b> in her expression. She was educated from early life to disbelieve in the capacity or general intelligence of the masses for efficient self-government. All her prejudices were nurtured {{in favor of the}} British Constitution as developed by Magna Charta, and administered by a king and ministers responsible to the nation; which form of government she believed to be above all comparison the best in the world. Yet, in spite of all these deeply-rooted prejudices, with a grasp of thought that could look at and examine questions of inherent right, on their original basis—with the abiding principles of the Christian faith to serve as a guide in judging of human duty in governments, and with the daily recurring practical examples of the conflicts of opinion between the Colonies and the mother country, which the American Revolution presented, she saw and acknowledged the wrongs inflicted on the Colonies—the justice of that cause in which they had, at length, banded for a higher measure of liberty, and the growing capacity of the people to maintain those rights. She was thus made an intellectual convert to the doctrines of the Revolution, and became a most useful and capable counsellor to Allen, in the subsequent critical periods of his life. Her mind was, indeed, a counterpart, in its boldness and originality, to that of her husband, whose intuitive mode of reaching conclusions enabled him to put into the shape of acts, what it might have sorely puzzled him sometimes to reason out; and what, indeed, if he could have reasoned ever so well, his bold and fiery zeal, and crushing rapidity of action, put him out of all temper to submit to the slow process of ratiocination. He also felt the happy influences of manners, opinions, and sentiments at once dignified and frank, yet mild and persuasive.|$|E

[...] Charles Dawes, who was slated to be Comptroller of the Currency as soon as the incumbent left office, was also a McKinley confidant. [...] Joseph Bristow, whose duties as Fourth Assistant Postmaster General under McKinley involved patronage appointments, later wrote that the President [...] "gave Hanna's requests great consideration and had confidence in the <b>clearness</b> of his opinion, but in the end he always followed his own judgment".|$|E
500|$|In {{the receipt}} of an {{impression}}, the soul is purely passive and the impression reveals not only its own existence, but that also of its cause—just as light displays itself and the elements that are in it.

500|$|In {{the first}} scene the two girls are {{returning}} from school, Agnes accompanied by her punning attribute, a lamb with a cruciform halo, and carrying a martyr's palm. They are accosted by Procopius, the young son of the Prefect of Rome, who has {{fallen in love with}} Agnes and shows her an open casket of jewels to persuade her to marry him. The inside of the casket is white, the only colour of opaque enamel in the original work, used only for a few highlights like the tiny area of the host held by Christ {{on the inside of the}} cover. Agnes [...] rejects him, with the words Illi sum desponsata cui angeli serviunt ("I am betrothed to him who the angels serve") in a banderole above. In the Caxton her rejection is unequivocal and not polite, and she points out that her heavenly fiancé has promised her much better jewels. [...] The Prefect stands behind his son, and in the next scene has sentenced her to serve in a brothel for being a Christian who refuses to sacrifice to the goddess Vesta. Caxton's Legend fills in the intervening action: Then made she of the bordel her oratory, ... All they that entered made honour and reverence to the great <b>clearness</b> that they saw about St. Agnes, and came out more devout and more clean than they entered. At last came the son of the provost with a great company for to accomplish his foul desires and lusts. And when he saw his fellows come out and issue all abashed, he mocked them and called them cowards. And then he, all araged, entered for to accomplish his evil will. And when he came to the <b>clearness,</b> he advanced him for to take the virgin, and anon the devil took him by the throat and strangled him that he fell down dead. In the next scene on the cup, Agnes stands outside the sentry box-like brothel, looking down at the Prefect's son who has been strangled to death by the devil crouched over him; a banderole reads Quo modo cecidisti qui mane oriebaris ("How has thou fallen that risest in the morning", [...] ), and the Prefect looks on sadly.|$|E
500|$|George Gilfillan, in an 1845 {{essay on}} Keats, placed the poem among [...] "The finest of Keats' smaller pieces" [...] and {{suggested}} that [...] "In originality, Keats has seldom been surpassed. His works 'rise like an exhalation.' His language has been formed on a false system; but, ere he died, was clarifying itself from its more glaring faults, and becoming copious clear, and select. He {{seems to have been}} averse to all speculative thought, and his only creed, we fear, was expressed in the words— Beauty is truth,—truth beauty". The 1857 Encyclopædia Britannica contained an article on Keats by Alexander Smith, which stated: [...] "Perhaps the most exquisite specimen of Keats' poetry is the 'Ode to the Grecian Urn'; it breathes the very spirit of antiquity,—eternal beauty and eternal repose." [...] During the mid-19th century, Matthew Arnold claimed that the passage describing the little town [...] "is Greek, as Greek as a thing from Homer or Theocritus; it is composed with the eye on the object, a radiancy and light <b>clearness</b> being added." ...|$|E
500|$|... 'Parthian frontality', {{as we are}} now {{accustomed}} to call it, deeply differs both from ancient Near Eastern and from Greek frontality, though it is, no doubt, an offspring of the latter. For both in Oriental art and in Greek art, frontality was an exceptional treatment: in Oriental art it was a treatment strictly reserved for {{a small number of}} traditional characters of cult and myth; in Greek art it was an option resorted to only for definite reasons, when demanded by the subject, and, on the whole, seldom made use of. With Parthian art, on the contrary, frontality becomes the normal treatment of the figure. For the Parthians frontality is really nothing but the habit of showing, in relief and in painting, all figures full-face, even at the expense (as it seems to us moderns) of <b>clearness</b> and intelligibility. So systematic is this use that it amounts to a complete banishment de facto of the side-view and of all intermediate attitudes. This singular state of things seems to have become established {{in the course of the}} 1st century A.D.|$|E
500|$|Learned Hand wrote {{approximately}} {{four thousand}} judicial opinions during his career. Admired for their clarity and analytic precision, {{they have been}} quoted more often in Supreme Court opinions and by legal scholars than those of any other lower-court judge. Both Hand's dissent in United States v. Kennerley and his ruling in United States v. Levine have often been cited in obscenity cases. Hand's view that literary works should be judged {{as a whole and}} in relation to their intended readership is now accepted in American law. His use of historical data to gauge legislative intent has become a widespread practice. According to Archibald Cox: [...] "The opinions of Judge Hand have had significant influence both in breaking down the restrictions imposed by the dry literalism of conservative tradition and in showing how to use with sympathetic understanding the information afforded by the legislative and administrative processes." [...] Hand's decision in the 1917 Masses case influenced Zechariah Chafee's widely read book, Freedom of Speech (1920). In his dedication, Chafee wrote, [...] " [...] during the turmoil of war courageously maintained the traditions of English-speaking freedom and gave it new <b>clearness</b> and strength for the wiser years to come." ...|$|E
500|$|The second {{quadrangle}} {{is larger}} than the first quadrangle, measuring 103feet 6inches by 94feet 6inches (31.55 by 28.80m). The central plot of the quadrangle was filled with gravel from at least 1695; grass was laid in 1859. All four sides of the quadrangle are Grade I listed buildings. Pevsner described the second quadrangle as [...] "a uniform composition", noting the [...] "regular fenestration by windows with round-arched lights, their hood-moulds forming a continuous frieze". The Dutch gables have ogee sides and semi-circular pediments. Norwich described the second quadrangle as having [...] "a strong feeling of unity owing to the somewhat relentless succession of ogival gables", adding that [...] "One is grateful for the projecting bay, oriel, chimneybreast and clock on the east side for breaking the monotony". He pointed out that it was [...] "almost a carbon copy" [...] of the front quadrangle of University College, Oxford, which was begun in 1634: in describing University College, he wrote that [...] "There are the same two-light windows, the same continuous rising and falling head-moulds on the three storeys, even the same oddly shaped gables" [...] as in Jesus College. Tyack, too, said that the gables were [...] "clearly influenced" [...] by University College. The writer Simon Jenkins said that the quadrangle has [...] "the familiar Oxford Tudor windows and decorative Dutch gables, crowding the skyline like Welsh dragons' teeth and lightened by exuberant flower boxes". Betjeman, describing the first and second quadrangles, said that they had [...] "what look like Cotswold manors on all sides", adding that [...] "The <b>clearness</b> of the planning of Jesus College and the relation of the heights of the buildings {{to the size of the}} quadrangles make what would be undistinguished buildings judged on their detail, into something distinguished". The 19th-century antiquarian Rowley Lascelles, however, described the ogee gables as [...] "dismal" [...] and called for them to be cut down into [...] "battlements" [...] (crenellations) to match those on the hall bay window; he went further, saying that [...] "this whole College requires to be gothicised, as it is called; that is, mannered into the pointed style. It is a good subject for it". Casson said that the second quadrangle was [...] "much the same mixture" [...] as the first, but looked [...] "a bit cramped and stiff".|$|E
