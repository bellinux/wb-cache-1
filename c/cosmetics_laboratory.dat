50|$|Due to {{its unique}} properties, mercury {{has been used}} in various {{products}} and processes for hundreds of years. Currently, it is mostly utilised in industrial processes that produce chlorine (mercury chlor-alkali plants) or vinyl chloride monomer for polyvinyl chloride (PVC) production, and polyurethane elastomers. It is extensively used to extract gold from ore in artisanal and small-scale gold mining. It is contained in products such as electrical switches (including thermostats), relays, measuring and control equipment, energy-efficient fluorescent light bulbs, batteries and dental amalgam. It is also used in <b>laboratories,</b> <b>cosmetics,</b> pharmaceuticals, including in vaccines as a preservative, paints, and jewellery. Mercury is also released unintentionally from some industrial processes, such as coal-fired power and heat generation, cement production, mining and other metallurgic activities such as non-ferrous metals production, as well as from incineration of many types of waste.|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} of cosmetics constitutes a challenge mainly {{due to the}} large variety of ingredients and formulations, and {{to the complexity of}} cosmetic products, in particular due to huge matrix variability. In 2009, the European Commission issued a Regulation (Regulation (EC) N° 1223 / 2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council) establishing the requisites for cosmetic products and the responsibilities of the stakeholders. While the manufacturers' are responsible {{to ensure the safety of}} the products put on the market and for the selection of the most appropriate method to perform the production, the quality control, the storage and the shipment of their cosmetic products according to the ISO 22716 Standard, the Competent Authorities testing laboratories should ensure the analytical control of the products in the frame of the market surveillance. The Regulation (EC) N° 1223 / 2009 also establishes that "the sampling and {{analysis of}} cosmetic products shall be performed in a reliable and reproducible manner. In the absence of any applicable Community legislation, reliability and reproducibility shall be presumed if the method used is in accordance with the relevant harmonised standards, the references of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union". In this frame JRC-IRMM was requested by the CEN/TC 392 on cosmetics to provide advice and guidelines on an appropriate pattern for method validation to allow the analysis of cosmetic products in the frame of Art. 12 of Regulation (EC) No 1223 / 2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council. This document therefore describes an original and pragmatic approach not only for method validation in this frame but also for further standardisation if deemed necessary. Finally the document was discussed and endorsed by the three main stakeholders active in the field of cosmetics analysis, namely the PEMSAC AM (Platform of European Market Surveillance Authorities for Cosmetics Analytical Methods group), set by the European Commission, the Official <b>Cosmetics</b> Control <b>Laboratories</b> (OCCL) Network, Council of Europe - EDQM and the CEN/TC 392 'Cosmetics'. All three groups are composed of Member States Competent Authorities for control; the manufacturers' representatives are observer members of the CEN/TC 392. JRC.

40|$|The recent {{advent of}} microphysiological systems - {{microfluidic}} biomimetic devices that aspire {{to emulate the}} biology of human tissues, organs and circulation in vitro - is envisaged to enable a global paradigm shift in drug development. An extraordinary US governmental initiative and various dedicated research programs in Europe and Asia have led recently to the first cutting-edge achievements of human single-organ and multi-organ engineering based on microphysiological systems. The expectation is that test systems established on this basis would model various disease stages, and predict toxicity, immunogenicity, ADME profiles and treatment efficacy prior to clinical testing. Consequently, this technology could significantly affect the way drug substances are developed in the future. Furthermore, microphysiological system-based assays may revolutionize our current global programs of prioritization of hazard characterization for any new substances to be used, for example, in agriculture, food, ecosystems or <b>cosmetics,</b> thus, replacing <b>laboratory</b> animal models used currently. Thirty-six experts from academia, industry and regulatory bodies present here {{the results of an}} intensive workshop (held in June 2015, Berlin, Germany). They review the status quo of microphysiological systems available today against industry needs, and assess the broad variety of approaches with fit-for-purpose potential in the drug development cycle. Feasible technical solutions to reach the next levels of human biology in vitro are proposed. Furthermore, key organ-on-a-chip case studies, as well as various national and international programs are highlighted. Finally, a roadmap into the future is outlined, to allow for more predictive and regulatory-accepted substance testing on a global scale...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} new sensor platforms {{of molecular}} self-assembly monolayers (SAMs) on semiconductor materials. We designed and characterized an amine terminated quartz surfaces that can anchor retinal molecules. We mimicked {{the environment of}} the opsin protein which accommodates the binding of chromophore molecules in the human eye. Each coupling step was characterized by water contact angle, ellipsometry, atomic force microscopy (AFM), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and transmission infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). After we confirmed the chromophores’ immobilization via Schiff base, we functionalized silicon-based microcantilevers in order to recognize the binding of retinal molecules to the surfaces. Our results indicated that properly designed and functionalized microcantilevers can be used to construct economical, fast and sensitive sensors for quality control in <b>cosmetics.</b> In our <b>laboratory,</b> we also studied SAMs of alkanethiols and DNA biomolecules on gallium phosphide. By the use of surface sensitive techniques, we quantitatively characterized the nature and organization of alkanethiol adsorbates on GaP (100) substrates. Water contact angle, AFM, FT-IR and XPS data showed evidence of the wettiability, roughness, molecular orientation, characteristic chemical and elemental composition, adlayer thicknesses, tilt angles and molecular coverages for the different adsorbates. Subsequent {{to the understanding of the}} alkanethiol surface modification, we used microcontact printing (ìCP) and dip-pen nanolithography (DPN) to create patterns on GaP (100). A complete characterization was done in order to understand the quality of each type of pattern, its chemical structure and the organization of the molecules on the surface. The differences between the two methods were dependent on the chosen molecular “ink. ” After a comprehensive study of lithographic methods on gallium phophide using alkanethiols, we described the SAMs of DNA biomolecules on H-doped GaP (100). Various analytical techniques confirmed the molecular well-packed DNA molecules and the DNA’s bioactivity on the inorganic surface. The results of this series of studies demonstrated the high-quality performance of SAMs on semiconductor materials. These modification methodologies can be applied for passivation methods and as possible biosensor platforms. ...|$|R
