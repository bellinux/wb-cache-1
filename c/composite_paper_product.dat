Tree-level models were constructed to estimate biomass of the different plant components of A. cyclops and A. saligna from stem diameter at knee height. An existing volume regression equation for A. mearnsii was adapted and the estimated volumes, based on diameter at breast height, and tree height, were converted to mass. Sample plots were used to estimate mass per unit area by tree component, species and region.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to find out how business-to-business companies are using social me- dia through a case study of global forest and <b>paper</b> <b>product</b> companies' use of Twitter. Previous social media research has placed focus on business-to-consumer types of organizations and this study aims to add to research of business-to-business types of organizations' use of social media through study of Twitter content. The intention {{of this study is to}} answer two main research questions and two sub questions. The first main research question: (1) How do forest and <b>paper</b> <b>product</b> companies use Twitter?, is an- swered by two sub questions: (1 a) What different types of content do forest and <b>paper</b> <b>product</b> companies publish on Twitter?, and, (1 b) Do forest and <b>paper</b> <b>product</b> companies use elements that support interaction on Twitter? The second research question asks: (2) Are there differences between North American and Northern European companies? This research project uses a quantitative content analysis to study the content of tweets and find differences between the chosen companies. This study looks at the 713 tweets published by 16 for- est and <b>paper</b> <b>product</b> companies from Canada, Finland, Sweden and the United States of Ameri- ca. Dialogic principles are used to study the use of interaction supporting elements. The main use of Twitter as a communication channel is defined through three main categories composed of fif- teen individual tweet types.
