The eight members of the <b>core</b> <b>research</b> team headquartered in New York, along with 16 outside consultant analysts, prepared the country and territory reports. The analysts used a broad range of sources of information—including foreign and domestic news reports, academic analyses, nongovernmental organizations, think tanks, individual professional contacts, and visits to the region—in preparing the reports.|$|E
25|$|Extremophiles, organisms able {{to survive}} in extreme environments, are a <b>core</b> <b>research</b> element for astrobiologists. Such organisms include biota which are {{able to survive}} several {{kilometers}} below the ocean's surface near hydrothermal vents and microbes that thrive in highly acidic environments. It is now known that extremophiles thrive in ice, boiling water, acid, alkali, the water core of nuclear reactors, salt crystals, toxic waste and {{in a range of}} other extreme habitats that were previously thought to be inhospitable for life. This opened up a new avenue in astrobiology by massively expanding the number of possible extraterrestrial habitats. Characterization of these organisms, their environments and their evolutionary pathways, is considered a crucial component to understanding how life might evolve elsewhere in the universe. For example, some organisms able to withstand exposure to the vacuum and radiation of outer space include the lichen fungi Rhizocarpon geographicum and Xanthoria elegans, the bacterium Bacillus safensis, Deinococcus radiodurans, Bacillus subtilis, yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, seeds from Arabidopsis thaliana ('mouse-ear cress'), as well as the invertebrate animal Tardigrade.|$|E

25|$|The Delaware Biotechnology Institute, or DBI, was {{organized}} {{as an academic}} unit of the University of Delaware in 1999 and moved into dedicated research facilities in 2001. DBI supports a statewide partnership of higher education, industry, medical, and government communities committed to the discovery and application of interdiscplinary knowledge in biotechnology and the life sciences. With some 180 people resident in the DBI facilities, including 20–25 faculty members representing 12 departments, 140 graduate and post-graduate students, and 20 professional staff members, DBI emphasizes a multi-disciplinary approach to life-science research. The <b>core</b> <b>research</b> areas pursued by DBI-affiliated faculty include agriculture, human health, marine environmental genomics, biomaterials, and computational biology/bioinformatics. Research in these and other areas is done in collaboration with faculty at Delaware State University, Delaware Technical and Community College, Wesley College, Christiana Care Health System, and Nemours Hospital for Children. One of the primary objectives of the Institute is to provide state-of-the-art research equipment to facilitate life science research and six core instrumentation centers and specialized facilities, each {{under the direction of}} an experienced researcher or administrator, is supported at DBI and made available to university researchers.|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{non-availability}} {{and growing}} proliferation concerns {{regarding the use}} of highly enriched uranium (HEU) fuel in nuclear research reactors, some HEU <b>cores</b> of <b>research</b> reactors around the world have already been converted into low enriched uranium (LEU) cores. However, a large number of HEU <b>cores</b> of <b>research</b> reactors could not be converted into LEU cores in the past due to the non-availability of suitable LEU fuel. Infact, the conversion of an HEU core into an LEU core without loss of performance requires several times higher density LEU fuel to replace the HEU fuel. The highest density LEU fuel developed, qualified and licensed up till now is based on U 3 Si 2 -AI with density 4. 8 gU/cm 3 and more higher density fuels are being developed for the conversion of existing HEU <b>cores</b> of <b>research</b> reactors around the world into LEU cores.

5000|$|Bertler {{researches}} climate history using [...] ice cores. During her PhD Nancy established collaborations {{with international}} partners in Germany and the USA and initiated New Zealand’s ice <b>core</b> <b>research</b> capability in the Ross Sea. As postdoctoral fellow with guidance and help by her mentors, Profs. Peter Barrett, Tim Naish, Alex Malahoff, Bertler {{went on to}} establish major infrastructure in support of ice <b>core</b> <b>research</b> in New Zealand. This included {{the development of a}} national ice <b>core</b> <b>research</b> facility with GNS Science, the building of a New Zealand intermediate ice core drilling system with Victoria University of Wellington. Since her joint appointment with Victoria University of Wellington and GNS Science in 2004, Bertler has led and managed the National Ice <b>Core</b> <b>Research</b> Programme. This culminated in the successful development of international science projects - in particular the NZ contribution to the International TransAntarctic Scientific Expedition (ITASE) project and the NZ-led 9-nation Roosevelt Island Climate Evolution (RICE) project, the latter of which she is the Chief Scientist.|$|E
