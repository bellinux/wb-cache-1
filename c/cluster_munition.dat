The ICBL and the CMC campaigns remain separate and continue to remind governments of their commitments to implement and promote both treaties. Landmine and <b>Cluster</b> <b>Munition</b> Monitor continues its unique civil society monitoring program on the humanitarian and developmental consequences of landmines, cluster munitions, and explosive remnants of war.|$|E
25|$|The ICBL {{monitors}} the global mine and <b>cluster</b> <b>munition</b> situation (through Landmine and <b>Cluster</b> <b>Munition</b> Monitor, its research and monitoring arm), and conducts advocacy activities, lobbying for implementation and universalization of the Mine Ban Treaty, humanitarian mine action programs geared toward {{the needs of}} mine-affected communities, support for landmine survivors, their families and their communities, and a stop to the production, use and transfer of landmines, including by non-State armed groups. The ICBL participates in the periodical meetings of the Mine Ban Treaty process, urges states not parties to the treaty to join and non-state armed groups to respect the mine ban norm, condemns mine use and promotes public awareness and debate on the mine issue, organizing events and generating media attention.|$|E
25|$|After some {{fighting}} {{on the outskirts of}} the village, Alkhan-Kala itself was hit by OTR-21 Tochka tactical missiles tipped with <b>cluster</b> <b>munition</b> warheads, killing or wounding many civilians. The rebels moved on, but a number of wounded fighters, including Khadzhi-Murat Yandiyev, were left in the local hospital and were captured by the Russians. On February 4, Russian forces, allegedly attempting to stop the Chechens from any further retreat, bombed the village of Katyr-Yurt. Up to 20,000 refugees desperately fled an intense bombardment that lasted for two days and killed hundreds of civilians, including the bombing of a civilian convoy which had been trying to leave the settlement during a lull in the fighting. A rebel post-operative war council was held in the village of Alkhan-Yurt, where it was decided that the Chechen forces would withdraw into the inaccessible Vedeno and Argun gorges in the southern mountains to carry on a guerrilla campaign against the Russians. The rebels then withdrew into the mountains.|$|E

50|$|All {{of these}} {{organizations}} share a common goal of preventing the adverse humanitarian and development impacts from <b>cluster</b> <b>munitions</b> and providing assistance to the victims and survivors of <b>cluster</b> <b>munitions,</b> as well as ensuring their inclusion in society. Organizations and individuals {{that make up the}} CMC also work directly to address the effects of <b>cluster</b> <b>munitions</b> through the course of their work in conflict zones, providing assistance to victims, clearing areas contaminated by <b>cluster</b> <b>munitions,</b> investigating human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law.|$|R
40|$|<b>Cluster</b> <b>munitions</b> are air-dropped or ground-launched munitions that {{release a}} number of smaller submunitions {{intended}} to kill enemy personnel or destroy vehicles. <b>Cluster</b> <b>munitions</b> were developed in World War II and are part of many nations' weapons stockpiles. <b>Cluster</b> <b>munitions</b> have been used frequently in combat, including the early phases of the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. <b>Cluster</b> <b>munitions</b> have been highly criticized internationally for causing {{a significant number of}} civilian deaths, and efforts have been undertaken to ban and regulate their use...|$|R

This report discusses the two major international initiatives that address cluster munitions: the Convention on <b>Cluster</b> <b>Munitions</b> (CCM) and negotiations under the UN Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW). Currently, the Obama Administration has reiterated U.

5000|$|The <b>Cluster</b> <b>Munitions</b> Ban Advocates are a {{group of}} {{individuals}} whose lives {{have been affected by}} <b>cluster</b> <b>munitions,</b> a particular type of explosive weapon that has been banned for its indiscriminate area effects and risk from unexploded ordnance. They come from Afghanistan, Albania, Cambodia, Croatia, Ethiopia, Iraq, Lao PDR, Lebanon, Tajikistan, Serbia and Vietnam. The Ban Advocates took {{an active role in the}} Oslo Process on <b>cluster</b> <b>munitions</b> that led to the Convention on <b>Cluster</b> <b>Munitions,</b> a treaty banning <b>cluster</b> <b>munitions</b> and providing innovative provisions to assist the victims of these weapons. The Ban Advocates initiative was launched in October 2007 by Handicap International Belgium, a founding member of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning International Campaign to Ban Landmines. The Ban Advocates spoke in front of the international community on many occasions. According to the Irish Minister for Justice, [...] "The indomitable spirit of the Ban Advocates, overcoming terrible injuries to bear witness to the horrors of <b>cluster</b> <b>munitions,</b> inspired us throughout." [...] The Ban Advocates blog provides regular updates on their work around the world.|$|R

50|$|The US {{military}} is developing new cluster bombs that it claims {{could have a}} much lower (less than 1%) dud rate. Sensor-fused weapons that contain {{a limited number of}} submunitions that are capable of autonomously engaging armored targets may provide a viable, if costly, alternative to <b>cluster</b> <b>munitions</b> that will allow multiple target engagement with one shell or bomb while avoiding the civilian deaths and injuries consistently documented from the use of <b>cluster</b> <b>munitions.</b> Certain such weapons may be allowed under the recently adopted Convention on <b>Cluster</b> <b>Munitions,</b> provided {{they do not have the}} indiscriminate area effects or pose the unexploded ordnance risks of <b>cluster</b> <b>munitions.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL) is a {{coalition}} of non-governmental organizations whose stated objective is a world free of anti-personnel mines and <b>cluster</b> <b>munitions,</b> where mine and <b>cluster</b> <b>munitions</b> survivors see their rights respected and can lead fulfilling lives.|$|R
5000|$|Possibly {{the most}} {{effective}} type of unguided ("dumb") weapon used during SEAD strikes are cluster bombs.

The Mk-20 Rockeye II anti-armor <b>cluster</b> <b>munition</b> and the CBU-87 general-purpose <b>cluster</b> <b>munition</b> are typical examples of these types of weapons.|$|E

Without funding, HALO warns, the removal of all the minefields and <b>cluster</b> <b>munitions</b> will take longer, leaving impoverished rural communities blighted by mines and <b>cluster</b> <b>munitions</b> for years to come.|$|R

5000|$|On 7 April, Thailand {{admitted}} using Dual-Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) {{during the}} clash, {{which has been}} identified by the <b>Cluster</b> <b>Munition</b> Coalition (CMC) {{as a type of}} <b>cluster</b> <b>munition.</b> These contain up to hundreds of small grenades or [...] "bomblets" [...] that scatter over vast areas, and are banned by the majority of countries under the Convention on Cluster Munitions. Thailand has not signed the pact, but has publicly pledged not to use such weapons. The CMC said this was the first confirmed use of cluster munitions since the convention became international law.|$|E
50|$|Cluster munitions {{remain in}} many areas, {{both on the}} surface and buried. Since late 2007 three <b>cluster</b> <b>munition</b> {{accidents}} have caused the deaths of two people and severe injuries to a further five adults and children. Similarly to the threat posed by mines, cluster munitions impact most on the financially marginalised elements of society who rely on scrap collecting, woodcutting and cultivation for their livelihood. They also have an impact upon infrastructure projects and HALO has found and destroyed cluster munitions of road widening projects. Occasionally clearance cannot keep up with development and at least one <b>cluster</b> <b>munition</b> was uncovered by road construction teams in 2010.|$|E
50|$|In total since 1999, HALO {{has cleared}} over 38 ha of mine {{contaminated}} land and 1,263 ha of <b>cluster</b> <b>munition</b> contaminated land. In the process, HALO has destroyed 4,330 mines and 5,377 cluster submunitions and other explosive items.|$|E

As a leader on the steering committee of the <b>Cluster</b> <b>Munitions</b> Coalition, Survivor Corps used its past experience with the Mine Ban Treaty to help ensure that the Convention on <b>Cluster</b> <b>Munitions</b> included the strongest possible requirements to provide assistance to victims of the weapon, their families and communities.|$|R
