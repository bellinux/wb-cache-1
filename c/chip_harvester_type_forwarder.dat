40|$|Thanks to miniaturization, {{it is now}} {{possible}} to imagine self-powered systems that can harvest energy from the environment to produce electrical energy. Out-of-plane electret-based vibration energy harvesters (E-EVHs) are an effective and inexpensive energy <b>harvester</b> <b>type</b> that has attracted much attention. Increasing the capacitance of variable capacitors is an effective way to improve the output power of E-EVHs. In this paper, firstly an accurate capacitance theoretical model of a double-ended fixed beam out-of-plane E-EVHs which has 97 % reliability compared with FEM (COMSOL Multiphysics) results is presented. A comparison of capacitance between the double-ended fixed beam structure and a cantilever structure of the same size indicates that the double-ended fixed beam structure has greater capacitance and capacitance variation. We apply this theoretical capacitance model to the mechanical-electrical coupling model of double-ended fixed beam out-of-plane E-EVHs and study harvesters’ output performances for different electret lengths by numerical and experimental method, respectively. There exists an optimal electret length to harvest maximum power in our simulation results. Enhanced electrostatic forces with increasing the electret length emphasizes the soft spring effect, which widens the half power bandwidth and lowers the resonance frequency. Increasing the length of the electret can reduce the resistance of the optimum load. The experimental results show trend consistent with the numerical predictions. The maximum output power can reach 404 µW (134. 66 µW/cm 2 /g) at the electret length of 40 mm when the external acceleration and the frequency were 5 m/s 2 and 74 Hz, respectively. The maximum bandwidth reaches 2. 5 Hz at the electret length of 60 mm. Therefore, the electret length should be placed between 40 mm and 60 mm, while ensuring a higher output power and also get a larger bandwidth in practical applications...|$|R

40|$|Waste harvesting, {{which occurs}} mostly but not {{exclusively}} at open waste dumps in Zimbabwe, constitutes {{one of the}} most important survival options for the urban poor. This paper analyses and discusses socio-economic benefits of informal waste harvesters in Victoria Falls town. Victoria Falls town has an estimated population of 31, 000 and is presently the fastest growing urban centre in Zimbabwe. An estimated 8000 tonnes of solid wastes are generated in the town every month. Questionnaires were administered to informal waste harvesters who recover materials mostly from three large open waste dumps. Thirteen dumpsite harvesters, who were available at the time of the survey and willing to participate, were interviewed during the month of October 2002. The questionnaire solicited for information on the character and dynamics of recuperative activities in the town, socio-economic and demographic characteristics of waste <b>harvesters,</b> <b>type</b> of materials recovered and their uses, and income derived from sale of harvested materials and how it is spent. Additional data were obtained from field observations. The study identified two categories of waste harvesters. The first group specialises in the recovery of foodstuffs mainly for household use. The second group comprises informal waste harvesters who specialise in the recovery of building materials such as bricks and river sand and scrap metal primarily for sale. Data provided by dumpsite waste harvesters interviewed show that the mean monthly income from the sale of harvested materials varied from Z$ 7500 (for 23. 1 % of the respondents) to Z$ 22, 500. 5 (for 15. 3 % of the respondents). Using the income they obtain from waste harvesting, most respondents (84. 6 %) indicated that they can now afford to pay school fees for their children in time while 61. 5 % stated that after engaging in resource recovery, they moved from informal settlements to Chinotimba where they now stay to a more decent accommodation with electricity, piped water and flush toilets. Prior to engaging in waste recovery, over a half of the informal waste harvesters indicated that were staying in informal settlements. The findings of this study, in particular the income and expenditure data, demonstrate that by engaging in waste harvesting, some of the urban poor are able to eke out living in an urban environment where economic opportunities are very limited.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This work {{addresses}} the accuracy and convergence of reduced-order models (ROMs) of energy <b>harvesters.</b> Two <b>types</b> of energy <b>harvesters</b> are considered, a magnetostrictive rod in axial vibrations and a piezoelectric cantilever beam in traverse oscillations. Using general-ized Hamilton’s principle, the partial differential equations (PDEs) and associated boundary conditions governing {{the motion of}} these harvesters are obtained. The eigenvalue problem is then solved for the exact eigenvalues and modeshapes. Furthermore, an exact expression for the steady-sate output power is attained by direct solution of the PDEs. Subsequently, the results are compared to a ROM attained following the common Rayleigh–Ritz procedure. It is observed that the eigenvalues and output power near the first resonance frequency are more accurate and has a much faster convergence to the exact solution for the piezoelectric cantilever-type har-vester. In addition, it is shown that the convergence is governed by two dimensionless constants, one that {{is related to the}} electromechanical coupling and the other to the ratio between the time constant of the mechanical oscillator and the harvesting circuit. Using these results, some inter-esting conclusions are drawn in regards to the design values for which the common single-mode ROM is accurate.

These <b>types</b> of <b>harvesters</b> have their maximum efficiency in a very narrow bandwidth around their natural frequency and are therefore unfit for being used in presence of random or wide spectrum excitation. In this study, a periodic substructure for multi-frequency energy harvesting with single piezoelectric patch is proposed. This system is able to harvest energy from several modes (the lower ones) and, through proper design, these modes may be obtained in a narrow frequency band. The substructure is designed through an analytical model that allows to place modes exactly where required and tests are carried out to validate the proposed analytical model. The results confirm {{the validity of the}} proposed model that could be exploited to determine solutions for further improving both the bandwidth and overall efficiency of the harvester by helping of nonlinearity phenomena...|$|R
40|$|Endocochlear {{potential}} (EP) is a battery-like electrochemical gradient {{found in}} and actively {{maintained by the}} inner ear [superscript 1, 2]. Here we demonstrate that the mammalian EP {{can be used as}} a power source for electronic devices. We achieved this by designing an anatomically sized, ultra-low quiescent-power energy <b>harvester</b> <b>chip</b> integrated with a wireless sensor capable of monitoring the EP itself. Although other forms of in vivo energy harvesting have been described in lower organisms [superscript 3, 4, 5], and thermoelectric [superscript 6], piezoelectric [superscript 7] and biofuel [superscript 8, 9] devices are promising for mammalian applications, there have been few, if any, in vivo demonstrations in the vicinity of the ear, eye and brain. In this work, the chip extracted a minimum of 1. 12 nW from the EP of a guinea pig for up to 5 h, enabling a 2. 4 GHz radio to transmit measurement of the EP every 40 – 360 s. With future optimization of electrode design, we envision using the biologic battery in the inner ear to power chemical and molecular sensors, or drug-delivery actuators for diagnosis and therapy of hearing loss and other disorders.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{introduces}} a relevant concept of energy harvesting for passive UHF {{radio frequency identification}} (RFID) relying on the exploitation of the power carried by the third harmonic signal generated by the RFID chip. The idea consists {{on the use of}} the sole third harmonic energy to power up an associated sensor to the RFID tag. The proposed concept is first demonstrated in simulation thanks to an equivalent model for the RF front-end of a passive UHF RFID chip. Although the proposed model is simplified, it considers the generated nonlinear signals, allowing an efficient design of the rectifier circuit, which is responsible of harvesting the third harmonic power besides ensuring the activation of the RFID chip in order to communicate with the reader. The power driving between the RFID <b>chip,</b> third harmonic <b>harvester,</b> and antenna at the fundamental and third harmonic frequencies is achieved by designing a low-loss distributed three-port impedance matching network. Simulation results confirm the operation of the matching network and the exploitation of the third harmonic signal by analyzing the power at different nodes in the circuit. Measurement results validate the proposed nonlinear chip model. A prototype of the RFID tag harmonic-harvester produces 39 μW of dc power harvested from the harmonic signal, showing good agreement with the simulation results. Finally, a sensor application exploiting the harmonic harvested power to energize a commercial temperature sensor at a distance of 80 cm from the reader is demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Short-rotation coppice (SRC) is an {{important}} source of woody biomass for bioenergy. Despite the research carried out on several aspects of SRC production, many uncertainties create barriers to farmers establishing SRC plantations. One of the key economic sources of uncertainty is harvesting methods and costs; more specifically, the performance of contemporary machine methods is reviewed. We collected data from 25 literature references, describing 166 field trials. Three harvesting systems predominate: 127 used single pass cut-and-chip harvesters, 16 used double pass cut-and-store harvesters, 22 used the cut-and-bale harvester, and one study used a cut-and-billet harvester. Mean effective material capacity (EMC) was 30 Mg fresh weight h- 1 (cut-and-chip technique), 19 Mg fresh weight h- 1 (cut-and-store technique) and 14 Mg fresh weight h- 1 (cut-and-bale technique). However, this comparison does not consider engine power, which varies with harvesting technique; cut-and-chip harvesters are by far the most powerful (> 200 kW). When limiting harvesters to a maximum engine power of 200 kW, cut-and-chip harvesters achieved the lowest EMC (5 Mg fresh weight h- 1), but they also perform a higher degree of material processing (cutting and <b>chipping)</b> than cut-and-store <b>harvesters</b> (only cutting) or than the cut-and-bale harvester (cutting and baling). The trend in commercial machinery is towards increased engine power for cut-and-chip and cut-and-store harvesters. No trends in EMC were documented for the recently developed cut-and-bale harvesting technique, which is presently produced in one version only. Field stocking (5 – 157 Mg fresh weight ha- 1 in the reviewed studies) has a significant effect on harvester EMC. Lower field stocking can constrain the maximum EMC achieved by the machine given that harvesting speed can only be increased to a point. While the reviewed studies did not contain sufficient harvesting cost data for a thorough analysis, harvesting costs ranged between 6 and 99 € Mg- 1 fresh weight...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} numerical and experimental investigations {{related to the}} piezoelectric energy harvester that operates at multifrequency mode. Employment of such operation principle {{provides an opportunity for}} obtaining frequency response characteristics of the harvester with several resonant frequencies and in this way increasing efficiency of the harvester at a wide spectrum of excitation frequencies. The proposed design of the energy harvester consists of five cantilevers which forms square type system. Cross sections of the cantilevers are modified by periodical cylindrical gaps in order to increase strain value and to obtain more uniform strain distribution along the cantilevers. Cantilevers are rigidly connected to each other and compose an indissoluble system. Square <b>type</b> <b>harvester</b> has seismic masses at every corner. These masses are placed under specific angle in order to reduce natural frequencies of the system and to create additional rotation moments in the body of harvester. Results of the numerical investigation revealed that harvester has five resonance frequencies in the range from 15 [*]Hz to 300 [*]Hz. Numerical analysis of the harvester revealed that the highest open circuit voltage density is 19. 85 [*]mV/mm 3. Moreover, density of the total electrical energy reached 27. 5 [*]μJ/mm 3. Experimental investigation confirmed that frequency response characteristics are obtained during numerical investigation and showed that energy density of the whole system reached 30. 8 [*]μJ/mm 3...|$|R
