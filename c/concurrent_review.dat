40|$|Objectives. To {{identify}} 1) {{the characteristics}} of patients receiving non acute (inappropriate) care and 2) the variables associated to inappropriate hospital use, in order to 3) estimate {{the relevance of the}} problem and to 4) focus future <b>concurrent</b> <b>reviews</b> and efforts to allocate patients to alternative health care settings. Design. A prospective review of a random sample of adult patients who presented to the Emergency Department of the Molinette Hospital. Patients were assessed at admission and on day 3, 5 and 8 using the Appropriateness Evaluation Protocol (Italian validated version). Patients: 490 overall; 312 (64 %) medical and 178 (36 %) surgical. Outcome measures. Acute (appropriate) and non acute (inappropriate) admissions, Major Disease Category, costs, mean weights of Diagnosis Related Groups, and length of stay (days). Results. The proportion of patients requiring acute care declined rapidly from presentation (84. 5 %) to the fifth day of admission (60. 9 %). Patients admitted during weekends showed a higher rate of inappropriate stay on day 5 (P= 0. 04). The proportion of inappropriate admissions was higher for medical rather than surgical patients (P= 0. 07) at presentation and at day 5 (P < 0. 01). Traditional social-demographic variables were not significant risk indicators for inappropriate admissions. The likelihood ratio for inappropriate admission at presentation was significantly higher for minor illnesses and disturbances (P= 0. 03). Inappropriate stay on day 5 was significantly associated with lower cost (P < 0. 01), lower mean DRG weight (P < 0. 01) and shorter length of stay (P= 0. 05) for medical but not for surgical admissions. Conclusions. Traditional epidemiological indicators are inadequate to target prospective <b>concurrent</b> <b>reviews.</b> Qualitative studies focusing on patient physician dialogue in different situations and contexts could widen our understanding of the problem and suggest new theoretical frameworks and theories to provide us with more detailed explanations...|$|R

Due to efforts of the Uzbek Government and international donors for the last 15 years, the microfinance sector could become a separate financial segment and address above-mentioned needs in progressive manner. On the other hand, the sector has relatively small share {{in the composition of}} financial mediation and its further development requires also consideration of such socio-economic and administrative factors as urbanization process along with uneven development of microfinance sector, acceleration of workforce growth due to increasing youth, the need for government’s transition away from costly poverty control methods, etc. Based on the sector development analysis by <b>concurrent</b> <b>reviewing</b> of these factors the paper reveals the lack of diversified sources of resources for microfinance institutions (MFIs), stiffness of regulatory framework, the need for improving the sector infrastructure in terms of covering credit risks, building up sector’s capacity in covering operational risks.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} the effects of a utilization management program on patterns of medical care among children and adolescents. METHODS: From 1989 through 1993, the program conducted 8568 reviews of pediatric patients, ranging in age from birth to 18 years. The program used preadmission and <b>concurrent</b> <b>review</b> procedures to review and certify patients' need for care. This study used multivariate analyses to assess changes in the number of days of inpatient care approved by the program and to determine whether limitations imposed on length of stay affected the risk of 60 -day readmission. RESULTS: <b>Concurrent</b> <b>review</b> reduced the number of requested days of inpatient care by 3. 2 days per patient. Low-birthweight infants and adolescent patients with depression or alcohol or drug dependence accounted for a disproportionate share of the reduction. Patients classified as admitted for medical or mental health care and whose stay was restricted by <b>concurrent</b> <b>review</b> were more likely (P <. 05) to be readmitted within 60 days after discharge. CONCLUSIONS: By limiting care through its review procedures, the utilization management program decreased inpatient resource consumption but also increased the risk of readmission for some patients. Continued investigation should be conducted of the effects of cost-containment programs on the quality of care given to children and adolescents, especially in the area of mental health...|$|E

40|$|During 1976 {{teachers}} in Taranaki, {{as in other}} parts of New Zealand, were expressing concern for children who appeared to make scant progress in language skills despite the best endeavours of teacher and pupil. Discussions with psychologists and education department officers resulted, in a research programme being structured to survey such a group. In view of the then current interest in visual and auditory perception deficiencies which were believed to contribute to learning difficulties, investigations were to be made of several strategies. It was planned to institute proceedings which would not only remedy deficiencies but could also become the basis for preventive action with similar pupils at an earlier age. At that time teachers were available to allow staffing of the project and so two schools were selected for field trials. Teacher nominations of candidates were tested and groups of children isolated who would benefit from the programme. Staff training commenced to build up a set of practices which would subsequently be modified as experience was gained. Teachers were also helped to devise monitoring behaviours to ensure adequate and comparable data collection strategies were instituted. During the investigation, changes in approach were made as programmes developed and from new insights resulting from <b>concurrent</b> <b>reviews</b> of the literature which became available. Two major shifts occurred, the second resulting in the abandonment of some major precepts concerning remedial programming. Investigations are still proceeding related to the early identification and preventive aspect. THE PROPOSAL It is now time {{to go back to the}} beginning. At that stage the writer held certain beliefs on causation and remediation of reading disabilities which became the basis for examining the hypotheses: • That learning disabled children present a number of neuro-sensory deficits which led to their disability. • That remedial programmes which build up these areas and reading programmes which are tailored to avoid use of those deficits will result in improved performance...|$|R

5000|$|Historically, Health {{maintenance}} organizations (HMO) tended {{to use the}} term [...] "health plan", while commercial insurance companies used the term [...] "health insurance". A health plan can also refer to a subscription-based medical care arrangement offered through HMOs, preferred provider organizations, or point of service plans. These plans are similar to pre-paid dental, pre-paid legal, and pre-paid vision plans. Pre-paid health plans typically pay for a fixed number of services (for instance, $300 in preventive care, a certain number of days of hospice care or care in a skilled nursing facility, a fixed number of home health visits, a fixed number of spinal manipulation charges, etc.). The services offered are usually at the discretion of a utilization review nurse who is often contracted through the managed care entity providing the subscription health plan.

We conducted a telephone survey {{to determine the}} status of utilization management in Canadian hospitals. The sample comprised a random selection of 30 % of acute-care hospitals with over 100 beds for adults in Ontario and Quebec and all such hospitals in the other provinces.

Of those, 90 (91 %) {{agreed to participate in}} an in-depth survey or to designate a senior administrator to be interviewed who was most knowledgeable about the program. High occupancy rates and funding issues were the most common environmental triggers for the development of utilization management programs; funding issues were listed more frequently by respondents in Ontario than by those elsewhere (p = 0. 0008). Retrospective review alone was used in half of the hospitals, <b>concurrent</b> <b>review</b> or some mixed approach being used in the other half.

40|$|Background: Eighty {{percent of}} {{patients}} treated medically for gastroesophageal reflux disease relapse after treatment. Many of these patients require indefinite treatment with omeprazole to prevent recurrence. Nissen fundoplication {{has been shown to}} be effective, safe and cost effective in the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease. We suggest a treatment algorithm, which encourages early surgical intervention in cases of recurrent esophagitis after a previously successful two-month course of omeprazole. Methods: We have offered laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication since 1993. Patients who received Nissen fundoplication since 1990 were asked to report return to baseline activity, medications, and lifestyle changes. <b>Concurrent</b> chart <b>review</b> of patients treated with omeprazole was conducted to analyze cost. Results: Patients receiving laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication were discharged significantly sooner and spent significantly less time convalescing when compared to those who underwent open Nissen fundoplication. Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication became cost effective at 1. 5 to 2 years when compared to omeprazole.
