2500|$|As an alumnus of a Quaker-affiliated college, {{he avoided}} {{military}} service during the Vietnam War by registering {{as a religious}} conscientious objector. Notwithstanding his father's vocation, Barry decided [...] "early on" [...] {{that he was an}} atheist. He said, [...] "The problem with writing about religion is that {{you run the risk of}} offending sincerely religious people, and then they <b>come</b> <b>after</b> <b>you</b> with machetes." ...|$|E
60|$|Limb. Yes, we will <b>come</b> <b>after</b> <b>you,</b> bully Brainsick: but I {{hope you}} will not draw upon us there.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, you are. There's a whole crowd who <b>come</b> <b>after</b> <b>you.</b> It {{all depends}} on how many other guests there are besides Mr. Peters." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't want {{much for}} your money, do you?" [...] laughed his cousin. [...] "I rather think if a bear <b>came</b> <b>after</b> <b>you</b> you'd take to your heels." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; they <b>came</b> <b>after</b> <b>you</b> went to India--from Oxford. Her {{husband died}} there, and she lost some money, I believe. They bought The Firs on the Bassett Road. She's a very sweet woman, and we're {{very fond of}} them both." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{letter from}} Miss Triscoe <b>came</b> <b>after</b> <b>you</b> were gone, {{asking us to}} find rooms in some hotel {{for her and her}} father to-morrow. He isn't well, and they're coming. And I've telegraphed them to come here. Now what do you say?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Youth, large, lusty, loving--Youth, full of grace, force, fascination! Do {{you know}} that Old Age may <b>come</b> <b>after</b> <b>you,</b> with equal grace, force, [...] fascination? ...|$|E
6000|$|But the Mule {{interrupted}} her by saying, [...] "Go ahead {{if you want}} to, and I'll <b>come</b> <b>after</b> <b>you.</b> A mule is as brave as a lion any day." ...|$|E
6000|$|In the bedroom, {{she spoke}} about Mr. Pope. [...] "He was dreadfully upset," [...] she said. [...] "His {{first thought was}} to <b>come</b> <b>after</b> <b>you</b> both with a pistol. If--if he hadn't married you----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I saw you in {{the street}} just now. You may suppose I am not able to walk as fast as you, with my short legs and short breath, and I couldn't {{overtake}} you; but I guessed where <b>you</b> <b>came,</b> and <b>came</b> <b>after</b> <b>you.</b> I have been here before, today, but the good woman wasn't at home.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{said you}} was going acwoss ve wiver,' panted Wee Willie Winkie, {{throwing}} himself off his pony. 'And nobody--not even Coppy--must go acwoss ve wiver, and I <b>came</b> <b>after</b> <b>you</b> ever so hard, but you wouldn't stop, and now you've hurted yourself, and Coppy will be angwy wiv me, and--I've bwoken my awwest! I've bwoken my awwest!' ...|$|R
2500|$|A {{week after}} Mandela's death, Julius Malema, {{leader of the}} Economic Freedom Fighters led a crowd of EFF members to Mandela's Houghton home {{to pay tribute to}} the late statesman. He said: [...] "Thank you for {{ushering}} in political freedom... Those who <b>came</b> <b>after</b> <b>you</b> failed to deliver economic freedom." [...] He shouted: [...] "Viva the militant Nelson Mandela, viva." [...] EFF members then laid red roses on a wall of tributes near Mandela's house.|$|R
6000|$|... "Anne, look here! Didn't I <b>come</b> <b>after</b> <b>you</b> {{for fifteen}} years? It's you I always have wanted and want yet, if I can get you. I don't care a rap for Harriet Warren or anyone but you. Now that's the truth right out, Anne." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are {{all your}} {{old friends and}} neighbors <b>come</b> <b>after</b> <b>you</b> to Essex," [...] cried Joan de Tany, laughingly, {{addressing}} Mary. [...] "Today it is Roger de Conde, yesterday it was the Outlaw of Torn. Methinks Derby will soon be depopulated unless you return quickly to your home." ...|$|E
6000|$|With a bound [...] Rise to thy feet, signor, {{and give}} thy hand [...] Unto thy lady, whom, tenderly drooping, [...] Support thou with thy strength, {{and to the}} table [...] Accompany, while the guests <b>come</b> <b>after</b> <b>you.</b> [...] And last of all the husband follows....|$|E
60|$|Cel. You see, ladies, {{the least}} breath of yours {{brings me to}} you: I have been seeking you at your lodgings, and from thence <b>came</b> hither <b>after</b> <b>you.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "What did {{you expect}} to find? A big hotel, {{and a lot of}} cockneys? If <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>after</b> grouse, <b>you</b> must <b>come</b> to what the grouse thinks pretty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. I {{decided that}} {{it ought to be}} over before he <b>came.</b> <b>After</b> that <b>you</b> can look him in the face, and so can I. Our concealments will matter nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mr Boffin {{intended}} to have placed {{this in the}} carriage for you this morning. He wished you to have it, as a little keepsake he had prepared--it is only a purse, Miss Wilfer--but as he was disappointed in his fancy, I volunteered to <b>come</b> <b>after</b> <b>you</b> with it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} not get ill. If you do, and I hear of it--I shall <b>come</b> <b>after</b> <b>you</b> with a troupe of doctor's and nurses. If I am a failure as a wife, {{no one has}} ever said I was {{anything}} but a success as a district visitor...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, madam!" [...] {{cried the}} {{impatient}} Burke. [...] "You settle {{the matter with}} the parsons, and I haven't a doubt {{you can make it}} all right; and I'll be off! Everything has got to be on board to-night. I'll <b>come</b> <b>after</b> <b>you</b> early this evening." [...] With this he departed.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Zillah left, and Mr. Heathcliff wished me to <b>come,</b> soon <b>after</b> <b>you</b> went to London, {{and stay}} till you returned. But, step in, pray! Have you walked from Gimmerton this evening?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not!" [...] he cried. [...] "But it has {{the hotel}} mark upon it! Ha, {{it must have been}} written by that tall Englishman who <b>came</b> in <b>after</b> <b>you</b> had gone. He said--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If William Brisket had {{anything}} to say of a rival, he said it out honest. 'Maryanne,' said he to me once, 'if that young man <b>comes</b> <b>after</b> <b>you</b> any more, I'll polish his head off his shoulders.' Now, that was speaking manly; and, if you could behave like that, you'd get yourself respected. But as for them rampagious Billingsgate ways before a lady, I for one haven't been used to it, and I won't put up with it!" [...] And so she bounced out of the room.|$|R
6000|$|... "What, he is here?" [...] said Jonathan Faux, coming forward. [...] "My {{mother would}} have no nay, as he'd been away so long, but I must see after him. And it struck me he was very like <b>come</b> <b>after</b> <b>you,</b> because we'd been talking of you o' late, and where you lived." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} what you mean, and I should like to gratify you," [...] said Bartley. [...] "Not that I care a rap what {{all the people in}} Equity think. I'll tell you what I'll do, I'll go down there with you and hang round a day or two; and then I'll <b>come</b> <b>after</b> <b>you,</b> when your time's up, and stay a day or two there. I couldn't stand three weeks in Equity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "MacNelly's got nerve, and his rangers are all {{experienced}} men. If {{they find}} out you're here they'll <b>come</b> <b>after</b> <b>you.</b> MacNelly's no gun-fighter, but he wouldn't hesitate to do his duty, even if he faced sure death. Which he would in this case. Duane, you mustn't meet Captain MacNelly. Your record is clean, if it is terrible. You never met a ranger or any officer except a rotten sheriff now and then, like Rod Brown." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{is easy to}} talk so {{when you}} are not feeling,' said Caterina, the tears flowing fast. 'It is bad to bear now, {{whatever}} may <b>come</b> <b>after.</b> But <b>you</b> don't care about my misery.' ...|$|R
6000|$|However, when he {{was leaving}} her cabin a little later with the empty dishes he whispered very low, [...] "Leave on your clothes an' roll up your blankets. Ay <b>come</b> back <b>after</b> <b>you</b> purty soon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But sincerely. Last year, when I {{found that}} you had gone to England, I <b>came</b> on <b>after</b> <b>you</b> {{as soon as the}} firm could spare me. And I found you engaged to this Freddie excrescence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{would both}} get it. He desires nothing unfair. Whatever he takes from you, {{so much he}} will give. And {{it is not only}} for this generation. Is it nothing to you that the chiefs of your own family who shall <b>come</b> <b>after</b> <b>you</b> shall be able to hold their heads up among other British peers? Would you not wish that your own son should come to be Earl Lovel, with wealth {{sufficient}} to support the dignity?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{you will}} have to put a label on your back, 'Second-hand!' or her velvet will be a scandal. I can't wear out that at home like this flagrant, flowery thing, that I saw Miss Curtis looking at as rather a disreputable article. There's preferment for you, Ailie! What do you think of a general's widow with six boys? She is <b>come</b> <b>after</b> <b>you.</b> We had a great invasion--three Curtises and this pretty little widow, and various sons!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Verena {{spoke with}} breathless haste and eagerness; {{there was a}} kind of passion in the way she tried to expiate her former want of candour. Olive listened, staring; at first she seemed {{scarcely}} to understand. But Verena perceived that she understood sufficiently when she broke out: [...] "You deceived me--you deceived me! Well, I must say I like your deceit better than such dreadful revelations! And what does anything matter when he has <b>come</b> <b>after</b> <b>you</b> now? What does he want--what has he come for?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I’m {{here by the}} cap’n’s orders," [...] said Tucker faintly. [...] "I don’t want to be here—far from it. As {{for people}} saying that I <b>come</b> here <b>after</b> <b>you,</b> them as knows me would laugh at the idea." ...|$|R
6000|$|MR. RICHARDS: [...] "Upon my soul, I don't {{know what}} you mean! I DON'T know what I've done. When you came at me, last night, with my ring and {{presents}} and other little traps, you might have knocked me down with the lightest of the lot. I was perfectly dazed; I couldn't say anything before you were off, and all I could do was to hope that you'd be more like yourself in the morning. And in the morning, when I came round to Mrs. Philips's, I found you were gone, and I <b>came</b> <b>after</b> <b>you</b> by the next train." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sure, Charlotte, both Denbigh and Egerton {{appear to}} have a great respect for religion; they are {{punctual}} at church, and very attentive to the service:" [...] Mrs, Wilson smiled as he proceeded, [...] "but religion may <b>come</b> <b>after</b> marriage, <b>you</b> know." ...|$|R
