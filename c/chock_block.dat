50|$|A {{cheap and}} simple {{alternative}} to catch points or a derail is a <b>chock</b> <b>block,</b> {{which is a}} piece of timber that can be positioned and locked over one of the rails {{at the end of a}} siding to protect the main line from runaways. In order for the siding to be used the <b>chock</b> <b>block</b> must be removed.|$|E
50|$|The M816 {{was used}} to recover {{disabled}} or stuck trucks and lift large components. A rotating, telescoping, and elevating hydraulic boom could lift a maximum of 20,000 lb. Although the truck {{was not meant to}} carry a load, the boom could support 7,000 lb when towing. They had 20,000 lb front and 45,000 lb rear winches, outriggers, boom braces, <b>chocks,</b> <b>block</b> and tackle, oxygen-acetylene torches, and other automotive tools.|$|R
50|$|The M62 and 543 were wreckers used {{to recover}} {{disabled}} or stuck trucks and lift large components. A rotating, telescoping, and elevating hydraulic boom could lift {{a maximum of}} 20,000 lb. The M62 had an Austin Western boom; its replacement, the M543, had one by Gar Wood. Although the truck {{was not meant to}} carry a load, the boom could support 7,000 lb when towing. They had 20,000 lb front and 45,000 lb rear winches, outriggers, boom braces, <b>chocks,</b> <b>block</b> and tackle, oxygen-acetylene torches, and other automotive tools.|$|R
50|$|The 15 cm Mörser M 80 {{was a heavy}} {{howitzer}} used by Austria-Hungary in World War I. It had {{a bronze}} barrel and was intended for siege work, although it had carriages suitable for both field and siege duties. The siege carriage was a steel sledge-type and was equipped with a hydraulic braking device to help absorb the recoil forces. Two wheels could {{be attached to the}} front of the carriage and a limber attached to the rear for transport. The field carriage relied on <b>chock</b> <b>blocks</b> and a rope brake device to absorb the gun's recoil.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Chock</b> a' <b>block</b> : Refers {{literally}} to {{the situation}} where pulling on the working line will not raise the load any further because the cheeks of one lifting block are already against the other. Figuratively this has come to mean that something is as full or as close as it can be.|$|R

[...] "Must I be all the time cleaning after you fellows? Blast ye! I spent an hour on that 'ere gun-carriage this very mornin'. But it all comes of White-Jacket there. If it warn't for having one too many, there wouldn't be any crowding and jamming in the mess. I'm blessed if we ar'n't about <b>chock</b> a' <b>block</b> here! Move further up there, I'm sitting on my leg!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, it wasn't; I {{said the}} corpusants {{have mercy on}} us all; and I hope they will, still. But do they only have mercy on long faces?--have they no bowels for a laugh? And look ye, Mr. Starbuck--but it's too dark to look. Hear me, then; I take that mast-head flame we saw for a sign of good luck; for those masts are rooted in a hold {{that is going to}} be <b>chock</b> a' <b>block</b> with sperm-oil, d'ye see; and so, all that sperm will work up into the masts, like sap in a tree. Yes, our three masts will yet be as three {{spermaceti}} candles-- that's the good promise we saw." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ray Rahman of Entertainment Weekly was {{somewhat}} less enthusiastic, calling The Life of Pablo [...] "an ambitious album that finds the rapper struggling to compact his many identities into one weird, uncomfortable, glorious whole ... Like the man himself, {{the album is}} emotional, explosive, unpredictable, and undeniably thrilling." [...] Alexis Petridis was more critical in The Guardian, finding it [...] "at turns, rambling, chaotic, deeply underwhelming, impressively audacious, and completely infuriating", suggesting that [...] "it appears to have had ideas thrown at it until it feels messy and incoherent" [...] despite concluding that [...] "when The Life of Pablo is good, its very good indeed." [...] The Daily Telegraphs Neil McCormick wrote, [...] "The Life of Pablo is certainly rich in musical scope, <b>chock</b> a <b>block</b> with inspired ideas", but also felt the work to be [...] "so self-involved it crosses over into self-delusion, marked by such a tangible absence of perspective and objectivity {{it is as if}} West has actually lost sight of the elemental basics of his art." [...] Writing for the Chicago Tribune, Greg Kot felt that [...] "The Life of Pablo sounds like a work in progress rather than a finished album." [...] In another mixed review, PopMatters Evan Sawdey wrote that [...] "The Life of Pablo obscurities and eccentricities make it ripe for endless dissection by Wests fans and followers, but make no mistake: this album is flawed, it’s problematic, and most of all, it’s no masterpiece." ...|$|R
