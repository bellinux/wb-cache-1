30|$|Having ones dignity {{protected}} {{requires the}} abolition of dominance through participation in a <b>co-legislative</b> <b>procedure.</b> Dignity and the moral package {{that goes with it}} is reflected in the clauses for inclusion and for equal-treatment that are entrenched in present-day political arrangements as well as visible in the contestation, critique and opposition to power structures. They are salient standards for critique and validation. These rights and rules are consensual principles protecting the internal dignity and external freedom of individuals. They are moral in nature and command the observance of all. The rules for inclusion and for equal treatment personify the principles of equal citizenship and membership in a body that inclusively and continuously engages in processes of collective self-determination – in processes of opinion and will formation. Only bodies that tie representatives into a structure of political accountability – of contestation and public deliberation – can claim to have institutionalised political equality and protected individuals’ dignity.|$|E
