2500|$|The centrepin reel (or centerpin, <b>center</b> <b>pin,</b> or float reel) is {{one which}} runs freely enough on its axle (its [...] "centrepin") to permit {{distance}} casting {{by allowing the}} line to be drawn off by {{the momentum of the}} cast from the rotating reel. [...] The centrepin reel uses a large diameter spool typically mounted to a 12–17 foot surfcasting rod. [...] A bracket attached to the reel that allows it to be rotated 90° to the rod for casting and returned to a position to retrieve line. In the casting position the spool is perpendicular to the rod, opening the face of the reel allowing the line to run {{off the side of the}} spool when released in the cast.|$|E
2500|$|In 1889, Colt {{introduced}} the Model 1889, the first truly modern double action revolver, which differed from earlier double action revolvers {{by having a}} [...] "swing-out" [...] cylinder, {{as opposed to a}} [...] "top-break" [...] or [...] "side-loading" [...] cylinder. Swing out cylinders quickly caught on, because they combined the best features of earlier designs. Top-break actions gave the ability to eject all empty shells simultaneously, and exposed all chambers for easy reloading, but having the frame hinged into two halves weakened the gun and negatively affected accuracy, due to lack of rigidity. [...] "Side-loaders", like the earlier Colt Model 1871 and 1873, gave a rigid frame, but required the user to eject and load one cylinder at a time, as they rotated the cylinder to line each chamber up with the side-mounted loading gate. Smith & Wesson followed 7 years later with the Hand Ejector, Model 1896 in [...]32 S Long caliber, followed by the very similar, yet improved, Model 1899 (later known as the Model 10), which {{introduced the}} new [...]38 Special cartridge. The Model 10 {{went on to become the}} best selling handgun of the 20th century, at 6,000,000 units, and the [...]38 Special is still the most popular chambering for revolvers in the world. These new guns were an improvement over the Colt 1889 design since they incorporated a combined center-pin and ejector rod to lock the cylinder in position. [...] The 1889 did not use a <b>center</b> <b>pin</b> and the cylinder was prone to move out of alignment.|$|E

5000|$|Two {{parallel}} {{tracks of}} [...] were set approximately 9 ft apart. Between these two tracks, the standard and narrow gauge tracks descended into a pit, one from {{each end of}} the pit, overlapping in the center and having a common center line. Beams resting on trucks riding on the 18 in gauge tracks were inserted under the car to have its trucks changed. The car was then pushed over pit, resting on the beams.

We propose that the anisotropic critical driving force for the vortex motion will be modulated by both the shape of the individual <b>pinning</b> <b>center</b> and the periodic structure of the pinning lattice. Moreover, we find that the anisotropic depinning transition of the driven vortices is very sensitive to the shift between the two pinning sublattices. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B,V.

The two <b>center</b> <b>pins</b> are commonly used for the receiver, and the outer pins connect the transmitter, so that a reversal of pin connection is unaffected. Standard handset receivers functions normally when their polarity is reversed, but the electret microphone transmitter used in most modern handsets may not. Many telephones include polarity protection, so that the polarity may be reversed without affecting operation. Handsets manufactured before 1985 using a carbon microphone transmitter are not sensitive to polarity. Some hands-free headsets also may have a 4P4C connector, but the wiring may differ from the above diagram.|$|R
