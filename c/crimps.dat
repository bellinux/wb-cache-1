25|$|Competition {{shooters}} {{also often}} sort bullets by weight, often down to 0.10 grain (6.5mg) increments. The bullet {{is placed in}} the case mouth by hand, and then seated with the press. At this point, the expanded case mouth is also sized back down. A crimp can optionally be added, either by the seating die or with a separate die. Taper <b>crimps</b> are used for cases that are held in the chamber by the case mouth, while roll <b>crimps</b> may be used for cases that headspace on a rim or on the cartridge neck. Roll <b>crimps</b> hold the bullet far more securely, and are preferred in situations, such as magnum revolvers, where recoil velocities are significant. A tight crimp also helps to delay the start of the bullet's motion, which can increase chamber pressures, and help develop full power from slower burning powders (see internal ballistics).|$|E

40|$|Minimization of {{response}} times and costs and maximization of {{the efficiency and}} quality in producing a product are imperative for survival in the competitive manufacturing industry. Sheet metal forming is a widely used and costly manufacturing process, to which these considerations apply. This work will be done to study the finite element (elastic-plastic) analysis of sheet metal <b>crimp</b> forming process using the finite element software. Ansys simulation is carried out to gain accurate and critical understanding of <b>crimp</b> forming process. Simulation of elastoplastic behavior of aluminum sheet is carried out with non-linear condition to investigate sheet metal <b>crimping</b> process. Maximum stress regions are identified. This can be improved by suitable curvature radius which is possible once FEM process is understood. In the present work contact elements are generated between <b>crimp</b> and <b>crimp</b> nut and the sliding dies for forming process. The contact pressure, vonmises stress and load requirements are captured for different angle of <b>crimp</b> sheets. The results shows drop in <b>crimp</b> load requirements with <b>crimp</b> metal inclination. Also a uniformity of contact is observed between <b>crimp</b> nut and <b>crimp</b> metal which is desirable feature for leak proof joints.

PET/PTT {{conjugate}} yarn has a three-dimension spiral and permanent <b>crimp,</b> which endow the yarn and loomage with excellent performances of <b>crimp</b> extension and <b>crimp</b> recovery. The residual deformation and internal {{stress of the}} self-crimp yarn can be eliminated after the moist heat treatment, {{in order to develop}} the favorable <b>crimp</b> extension and <b>crimp</b> recovery of the self-crimp yarn, and to give the loomage soft handle and good dimension stability. <b>Crimp</b> shrinkage, <b>crimp</b> module, etc, of the different types of PET/PTT yarn, were tested, and the axial morphology of the yarn was observed, to investigate the effect of linear density, moist heat temperature on PET/PTT yarn...|$|R
40|$|Generally, {{hand-operated}} and hydraulic compressors use <b>crimping</b> {{of connection}} terminals. However, this equipment often causes compressed defects because non-uniform pressure is {{applied in the}} circumferential direction of the terminal during <b>crimping.</b> A defective terminal often leads to fire in electric equipment due to overheating. Therefore, {{there is a need}} to develop a new <b>crimping</b> process for manufacturing highly durable terminals. MPC (magnetic pulse <b>crimping)</b> uses uniform electromagnetic pressure by a high magnetic field interaction between coil and terminal. This process uses only electromagnetic pressure for <b>crimping,</b> so the terminal can be <b>crimped</b> without physical contact, thereby producing a highly durable connection terminal. In this study, a MPC process was developed to fabricate a prototypical terminal. The result was compared with other <b>crimping</b> processes in terms of durability. The <b>crimped</b> part using MPC has a lower rising temperature and higher tensile strength than those using other <b>crimping</b> process. It is inferred from the experimental results that an optimal charging voltage exists in the MPC proces...|$|R

2500|$|Slugs for shotgun shells {{are also}} {{commonly}} cast from pure lead by handloaders, for subsequent reloading into shotgun shells. [...] Although roll <b>crimps</b> of shotgun hull cases {{are commonly used}} for handloading these cast lead slugs, {{in place of the}} fold <b>crimps</b> that are used when reloading shot into shotgun shells, some published recipes specifically do include fold <b>crimps.</b> [...] For published recipes using fold <b>crimps</b> and shot wads used as sabots, slugs can be easily reloaded using standard shotshell presses and techniques, without requiring any roll crimp tools. [...] Whether roll <b>crimps</b> or fold <b>crimps</b> are used, cast lead slugs are commonly used in jurisdictions where rifles are banned for hunting, under the reasoning that fired slugs will not travel but over short distances, unlike rifle bullets which can travel up to several miles when fired. [...] Use of cast lead slugs is therefore very common when hunting large game near populated areas.|$|E
2500|$|Primer pocket swages can {{be either}} standalone, bench-mounted, {{specialized}} presses, or, alternatively, a special swage anvil die that can be mounted into a standard [...] "O" [...] style reloading press, along with a special shell holder insert with either a large or a small primer pocket insert swage that is then inserted into the position on the [...] "O" [...] press where a normal shell holder is usually clicked into position. [...] This way, both small and large primer pockets on different types of military cases can be properly processed to remove primer pocket <b>crimps.</b> [...] Both types of presses {{can be used to}} remove either ring <b>crimps</b> or stab <b>crimps</b> found on military cartridges when reloading them. [...] Reamers for removing primer pocket <b>crimps</b> are not associated with presses, being an alternative to using a press to remove military case primer pocket <b>crimps.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Removal of the primer, called decapping, in {{reference}} to primers being often previously called primer caps or just caps, is usually done with a die containing a steel pin that punches out the primer. Berdan primed cases require a different technique, either a hydraulic ram or a hook that punctures the case and levers it out from the bottom. Military cases often have crimped-in primers, and decapping them leaves a slightly indented ring (most common) or, for some military cartridges, a set of stabbed ridges located {{on the edge of}} the primer pocket opening that inhibits or prevents seating a new primer into a decapped case. A reamer or a swage is used to remove both these styles of crimp, whether ring <b>crimps</b> or stab <b>crimps.</b> [...] The purpose of all such primer <b>crimps</b> is to make military ammunition more reliable under more extreme environmental conditions. [...] Some military cartridges also have sealants placed around primers, in addition to <b>crimps,</b> to provide additional protection against moisture intrusion that could deactivate the primer for any ammunition exposed to water under battlefield [...] conditions. [...] Decapping dies, though, easily overcome the additional resistance of sealed primers, with no significant difficulty beyond that encountered when removing non-sealed primers.|$|E

2500|$|Dies for {{bottle neck}} cases usually are {{supplied}} in sets {{of at least}} two dies, though sometimes a third is added for crimping. This is an extra operation and is not needed unless a gun's magazine or action design requires crimped ammunition for safe operation, such as autoloading firearms, where the cycling of the action may push the bullet back in the case, resulting in poor accuracy and increased pressures. [...] Crimping is also sometimes recommended to achieve full velocity for bullets, through increasing pressures so as to make powders burn more efficiently, and for heavy recoiling loads, to prevent bullets from moving under recoil. [...] For FMJ bullets mounted in bottle neck cases, roll crimping is generally not ever used unless a cannelure is present on the bullet, to prevent causing bullet deformation when crimping. [...] Rimless, straight wall cases, on the other hand, require a taper crimp, because they headspace on the case mouth; roll crimping causes headspacing problems on these cartridges. Rimmed, belted, or bottleneck cartridges, however, generally can safely be roll crimped when needed. Three dies are normally supplied for straight walled cases, with an optional fourth die for crimping. <b>Crimps</b> for straight wall cases may be taper <b>crimps,</b> suitable for rimless cartridges used in autoloaders, or roll <b>crimps,</b> which are best for rimmed cartridges such as are used in revolvers.|$|E

2500|$|Shotshell presses are {{generally}} a single {{unit of the}} [...] "H" [...] configuration that handles all functions, dedicated to reloading just one gauge of shotshell. Shotshell reloading is similar to cartridge reloading, except that, instead of a bullet, a wad and a measure of shot are used, and after loading the shot, the shell is crimped shut. Both 6 and 8 fold <b>crimps</b> are in use, for paper hulls and plastic hulls, respectively. [...] Likewise, roll <b>crimps</b> are in use for metallic, paper, and plastic hulls. [...] The shotshell loader contains stations to resize the shell, measure powder, load the wad, measure shot, and crimp the shell. Due to the low cost of modern plastic shotshells, and the additional complexity of reloading fired shells, shotshell handloading is not as popular as cartridge handloading. [...] For example, unlike when handloading rifle and pistol cartridges, where all the various components (cases, gas checks, powder, primers, etc.) from different manufacturers are usually all interchangeable, shotshells typically are loaded for particular brands of shotshell cases (called hulls) only with one specific brand of wad, shot cup (if used), primer, and powder, further increasing the complexity and difficulty of reloading shotshells. Substitution of components is not considered safe, as changing just one component, such as a brand of primer, can increase pressures {{by as much as}} 3500 PSI, which may exceed SAAMI pressure limits. [...] Reloading shotshells is therefore more along the lines of precisely following a recipe with non-fungible components. [...] Where shotshell reloading remains popular, however, is for making specialized shotgun shells, such as for providing lowered recoil, when making low-cost [...] "poppers" [...] used for training retrievers before hunting season to acclimate hunting dogs to the sound of a gun firing without actually shooting projectiles, for achieving better shot patterning, or for providing other improvements or features not available in commercially loaded shotshells at any price, such as when handloading obsolete shotshells with brass cases for gauges of shotshells that are no longer commercially manufactured.|$|E

30|$|The {{waviness}} or {{distortion of}} a yarn that {{is due to}} interlacing in the fabric is termed as <b>crimp.</b> In woven fabrics, the <b>crimp</b> {{is measured by the}} relation between the length of the fabric sample and the corresponding length of yarn when it is removed there from and straightened under suitable tension. <b>Crimp</b> may be expressed numerically as percentage <b>crimp</b> or <b>crimp</b> ratio. Position of whip roller has significant effect on Crimp% of woven fabric as warp yarn tension is an important player in case of crimp%.

2500|$|Double wire, twin loop, or Wire-O binding {{is a type}} of binding that is {{used for}} books that will be viewed or read in an office or home type environment. The binding {{involves}} the use of a [...] "C" [...] shaped wire spine that is squeezed into a round shape using a wire closing device. Double wire binding allows books to have smooth crossover and is affordable in many colors. This binding is great for annual reports, owners manuals and software manuals. Wire bound books are made of individual sheets, each punched with a line of round or square holes on the binding edge. This type of binding uses either a 3:1 pitch hole pattern with three holes per inch or a 2:1 pitch hole pattern with two holes per inch. The three to one hole pattern is used for smaller books that are up to 9/16" [...] in diameter while the 2:1 pattern is normally used for thicker books as the holes are slightly bigger to accommodate slightly thicker, stronger wire. Once punched, the back cover is then placed on to the front cover ready for the wire binding elements (double loop wire) to be inserted. The wire is then placed through the holes. The next step involves the binder holding the book by its pages and inserting the wire into a [...] "closer" [...] which is basically a vise that <b>crimps</b> the wire closed and into its round shape. The back page can then be turned back to its correct position, thus hiding the spine of the book.|$|E
