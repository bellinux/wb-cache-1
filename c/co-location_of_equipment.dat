40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{contribute}} to the understanding of spatial concentration of logistics firms by empirically analyzing synergies through co-location and investigating whether <b>co-location</b> <b>of</b> logistics establishments in specialized logistics concentration areas results in benefits compared to co-location in diverse logistics concentration areas. Methodology: A survey among managers of 128 logistics establishments located in logistics concentration areas was used to test for differences between synergies through co-location on specialized versus diverse logistics parks. Findings: The findings show that logistics firms co-located on fresh logistics parks more often share knowledge, combine transport and storage capacity, and trade products last minute than other co-located logistics firms do. Research implications: This research shows that there are synergies through <b>co-location</b> <b>of</b> logistics activities on specialized logistics parks. Managers of logistics companies may need to take these benefits into account in location decisions, academics in facility location models, and policy makers in spatial planning. Originality/value: Although anecdotic evidence suggests that <b>co-location</b> <b>of</b> logistics activities can bring several benefits to the co-located logistics companies and hence, can be important to incorporate in the location decisions of these companies, these benefits are not (much) empirically researched before.

40|$|Background: Several {{countries}} have co-located General Practitioners (GPs) in Primary Care Centres (PCCs) with other {{health and social}} care professionals {{in order to improve}} integrated care. It is not clear whether the <b>co-location</b> <b>of</b> a multidisciplinary team actually facilitates a positive patient experience concerning GP care. The aim {{of this study was to}} verify whether the <b>co-location</b> <b>of</b> GPs in PCCs is associated positively with patient satisfaction with their GP when patients have experience of a multidisciplinary team. We also investigated whether patients who frequently use health services, due to their complex needs, benefitted the most from the <b>co-location</b> <b>of</b> a multidisciplinary team. Methods: The study used data from a population survey carried out in Tuscany (central Italy) at the beginning of 2015 to evaluate the patients’ experience and satisfaction with their GPs. Multilevel linear regression models were implemented to verify the relationship between patient satisfaction and co-location. This key explanatory variable was measured by considering both the list of GPs working in PCCs and the answers of surveyed patients who had experienced the <b>co-location</b> <b>of</b> their GP in a multidisciplinary team. We also explored the effect modification on patient satisfaction due to the use of hospitalisation, access to emergency departments and visits with specialists, by performing the multilevel modelling on two strata of patient data: frequent and non-frequent health service users. Results: A sample of 2025 GP patients were included in the study, 757 of which were patients of GPs working in a PCC. Patient satisfaction with their GP was generally positive. Results showed that having a GP working within a PCC and the experience of the co-located multidisciplinary team were associated with a higher satisfaction (p < 0. 01). For non-frequent users of health services on the other hand, the <b>co-location</b> <b>of</b> multidisciplinary team in PCCs was not significantly associated with patient satisfaction, whereas for frequent users, the strength of relationships identified in the overall model increased (p < 0. 01). Conclusion: The <b>co-location</b> <b>of</b> GPs with other professionals and their joint working as experienced in PCCs seems to represent a greater benefit for patients, especially for those with complex needs who use primary care, hospitals, emergency care and specialized care frequently...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 This {{historical}} sociospatial analysis {{explored the}} question: What {{policies and practices}} enabled the construction of Chinatowns in the U. S. West as spaces of marginalization? Within this, the dissertation examined two secondary questions: (a) What mechanisms resulted in the spatial marginalization of Chinatowns? (b) What mechanisms resulted in the <b>co-location</b> <b>of</b> Chinatowns and red-light districts? The study looked in particular at five potential dimensions of spatial marginalization: location, infrastructure, laws and regulations, social norms, and co-location. The dissertation has three main components. It first presents an overview of Chinatowns in the U. S. West from 1848 through the 1910 s and {{the rise and fall}} of red-light districts, nationally, from the 1890 s to the 1920 s. GIS maps were constructed from historical census data to show the growth of Chinese communities in the U. S. West prior to 1880 and their contraction by 1900. It then presents the two linked studies that form the heart of the dissertation. Using historical census data and Sanborn maps, the first study examined the role of location, infrastructure, and <b>co-location</b> as mechanisms <b>of</b> marginalization in five U. S. western towns - Prescott, Arizona; Bakersfield, California; Reno, Nevada; Baker City, Oregon; and Walla Walla, Washington. Analyses focused on characterizing the spatial layout of each town in 1890, providing evidence of spatial marginalization strategies, and uncovering <b>co-location</b> <b>of</b> Chinatowns and red-light districts in each of these towns from the 1890 s to the 1920 s. The second study, an in-depth case study of Reno, examined the role of laws and regulations and social norms, and uncovered the policies behind the <b>co-location</b> <b>of</b> its Chinatown and red-light district. These studies, in combination with the contextual investigation, provided compelling findings on the sociospatial factors resulting in the marginalization of Chinatowns in the U. S. West. The dissertation expands on extant studies by looking at the role of sociospatial factors across five Western Chinatowns. It also contributes new findings on the influence Whites had in the process <b>of</b> <b>co-location</b> <b>of</b> Chinatowns and red-light districts. Methodologically, the dissertation adds to the very small body of research by historians of social welfare using spatial analyses...|$|R
