40|$|Power {{issues in}} the {{relationship}} between service users and <b>clinical</b> <b>psychologists</b> have received little attention from a postmodern perspective. The recovery approach and the scientist-practitioner model as recommended in best practice guidelines creates an argument for investigating power dynamics in academic and practical disseminations. 	This study aimed to investigate the social construction of service users and <b>clinical</b> <b>psychologists</b> in articles. 	Twelve articles and opinion pieces written by <b>clinical</b> <b>psychologists</b> and service users were sampled from publications of the Clinical Psychology Forum. A Foucauldian Discourse Analytic method was used to identify dominant discourses and counter-discourses. The discourses were linked to the power dynamics in play between relevant institutions. 	The analysis identified an economic discourse, a technical-rational discourse and an expert discourse as constructing service users and <b>clinical</b> <b>psychologists.</b> 	<b>Clinical</b> <b>psychologists</b> were found to have more discourse availability than service users, and {{in a position to make}} choices, whereas service users were found to have availability to a limited number of discourses with fewer options of subjectivity. A need for <b>clinical</b> <b>psychologists</b> to make conscious choices in practice was implied...|$|R

Sexologist Gloria Brame wrote in her book The Truth about Sex, a Sex Primer for the 21st Century that the Magic Wand was one of the more successful masturbation aids marketed, and stated it was popular due to its non-penetrative nature. Australian <b>clinical</b> <b>psychologist</b> and sex therapist Bettina Arndt reported that a couple she corresponded with had success using the Magic Wand while simultaneously engaging in sexual intercourse. Physician and sex columnist Hilda Hutcherson recommended the Magic Wand in her book Pleasure, and suggested women could place a soft cloth over their vulva if they felt it was needed to decrease delivered intensity from the device. Cosmopolitan magazine reported that the Magic Wand was the vibrator most often suggested by sex therapists.|$|E

50|$|The United States Army had no unified {{program for}} the use of <b>clinical</b> <b>psychologists</b> until 1944, towards the end of World War II. Before this time, no <b>clinical</b> <b>psychologists</b> were serving in Army {{hospitals}} under the supervision of psychiatrists. This had to do with psychologists’ opposition to this type of service and also to the limited role the Army assigned to psychiatry. At this time, the only psychiatric interview that was being processed on the ever-increasing numbers of military recruits lasted only three minutes and could only manage to weed out the severely disturbed recruits. Under these conditions, it was impossible to determine which seemingly normal recruits would crack under the strain of military duties, and the need for <b>clinical</b> <b>psychologists</b> grew. By 1945 there were over 450 <b>clinical</b> <b>psychologists</b> serving in the U.S. Army.|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} clarify issues faced by <b>clinical</b> <b>psychologists</b> in {{multidisciplinary}} medical teams. It examined three points: 1) the difficulties faced by <b>clinical</b> <b>psychologists</b> in multidisciplinary medical teams; 2) {{the skills and}} knowledge required in such teams; and 3) the areas in which graduate school education could be improved. The data used in the study was open data from surveys of <b>clinical</b> <b>psychologists</b> (N = 731). First, we conducted qualitative analysis of answers given to an open-ended question asking why collaboration among <b>clinical</b> <b>psychologists</b> remains undeveloped. Second, we conducted quantitative analysis of subjects’ responses to questions about the knowledge and skills useful for collaboration, and how they acquired these skills. The results indicated that 1) the personal characteristics of <b>clinical</b> <b>psychologists,</b> such as how flexible and sociable they are, can cause difficulties in multidisciplinary collaboration, so these “ non-professional ” skills need to be specifically taught, 2) “ assessment ” and “psychotherapy” are useful skills, but are mainly acquired through practice, and 3) education on skills application needs to be provided in graduate school...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the current perceptions and practices of discussing firearm risk management with patients diagnosed with selected mental health problems. A three-wave survey was mailed to a national random sample of <b>clinical</b> <b>psychologists</b> and 339 responded (62 %). The majority (78. 5 %) believed firearm safety issues were greater among those with mental health problems. However, the majority of <b>clinical</b> <b>psychologists</b> did not have a routine system for identifying patients with access to firearms (78. 2 %). Additionally, the majority (78. 8 %) reported they did not routinely chart or keep a record of whether patients owned or had access to firearms. About one-half (51. 6 %) of the <b>clinical</b> <b>psychologists</b> reported they would initiate firearm safety counseling if the patients were assessed as at risk for self-harm or harm to others. Almost half (46 %) of <b>clinical</b> <b>psychologists</b> reported not receiving any information on firearm safety issues. Thus, the findings of this study suggest that a more formal role regarding anticipatory guidance on firearms is needed in the professional training of <b>clinical</b> <b>psychologists...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study components of desired characteristics of Thai <b>Clinical</b> <b>Psychologists.</b> The sample consisted of 169 Thai <b>clinical</b> <b>psychologists</b> who have Thai clinical license and work on psychiatric in the hospital selected by simple random sampling technique. The research instrument was characteristics of Thai <b>Clinical</b> <b>Psychologists</b> questionnaires. Data were analyzed by means of second order confirmatory factor analysis using LISREL version 8. 72. The results of the research revealed that desired characteristics of Thai <b>Clinical</b> <b>Psychologists</b> consisted of 3 components; ability, personality and ethics. The characteristics of Thai <b>Clinical</b> <b>Psychologists</b> was congruent with the empirical data.

The results of second order confirmatory factor analysis of model in the characteristics of Thai <b>Clinical</b> <b>Psychologists</b> were found that model was fitted with empirical data.

25|$|<b>Clinical</b> <b>psychologist</b> Gershen Kaufman's view {{of shame}} {{is derived from}} that of affect theory, namely that shame {{is one of a}} set of instinctual, short-duration {{physiological}} reactions to stimulation.
