25|$|On 6 December 2002, {{the first}} ground {{tests of the}} BA609 {{prototype}} began, and the first flight took place on 6 March 2003 in Arlington, Texas, flown by test pilots Roy Hopkins and Dwayne Williams. After 14 hours of helicopter-mode flight testing, the prototype was moved to a ground testing rig to study the operational effects of the conversion modes. Following the completion of ground-based testing, on 3 June 2005 the prototype resumed flight testing, focusing on the expansion of its flight envelope. On 22 July 2005, the first conversion from helicopter to aeroplane mode while in flight took place. By October 2008, 365 flight-hours had been logged by two prototype aircraft. The AW609 demonstrated a safe dual-engine failure in normal <b>cruise</b> <b>flight</b> on 15 May 2009. By February 2012, this had risen to 650 hours, and {{it was reported that}} 85 percent of the AW609's flight envelope had been explored. Test pilot Paul Edwards has stated that the AW609 was not susceptible to the vortex ring state phenomena, naturally slipping out of the vortex on its own since both rotors will not simultaneously enter the vortex ring state.|$|E

40|$|Albatrosses {{are known}} to expend {{only a small amount}} of energy during flight. The low energy cost of {{albatross}} flight has been attributed to energy-efficient gliding (soaring) with sporadic flapping, although little is known about how much time and energy albatrosses expend in flapping versus gliding during <b>cruising</b> <b>flight.</b> Here, we examined the heart rates (used as an instantaneous index of energy expenditure) and flapping activities of free-ranging black-browed albatrosses (Thalassarche melanophrys) to estimate the energy cost of flapping as well as time spent in flapping activities. The heart rate of albatrosses during flight (144 beats min- 1) was similar to that while sitting on the water (150 beats min- 1). In contrast, heart rate was much higher during takeoff and landing (ca. 200 beats min- 1). Heart rate during <b>cruising</b> <b>flight</b> was linearly correlated with the number of wing flaps per minute, suggesting an extra energy burden of flapping. Albatrosses expend only 4. 6 % ± 1. 4 % of their time in flapping during <b>cruising</b> <b>flight,</b> which was significantly lower than those during and shortly after takeoff (9. 8 % ± 3. 5 %). Flapping activity, which amounted to just 4. 6 % of the time in flight, accounted for 13. 3 % of the total energy expenditure during <b>cruising</b> <b>flight.</b> These results support the idea that albatrosses achieve energy-efficient flight by reducing the time spent in flapping activity, which is associated with high energy expenditure...|$|R

2500|$|The USAF SR-71 Blackbird {{strategic}} {{reconnaissance aircraft}} made {{frequent use of}} air-to-air refueling. Indeed, design considerations of the aircraft made its mission impossible without aerial refueling. Based at Beale AFB in central California, SR-71s had to be forward deployed to Europe and Japan prior to flying actual reconnaissance missions. These trans-Pacific and trans-Atlantic flights during deployment were impossible without aerial refueling. The SR-71's designers traded takeoff performance for better high-speed, high-altitude performance, necessitating takeoff with less-than-full fuel tanks from even the longest runways. Once airborne, the Blackbird would accelerate to supersonic speed using afterburners to facilitate structural heating and expansion. The magnitude of temperature changes experienced by the SR-71, from parked to its maximum speed, resulted in significant expansion of its structural parts in <b>cruise</b> <b>flight.</b> To allow for the expansion, the Blackbird's parts had to fit loosely when cold, so loosely, in fact, that the Blackbird constantly leaked fuel before heating expanded the airframe enough to seal its fuel tanks. Following the supersonic dash, and to stop the fuel leaks, the SR-71 would then rendezvous with a tanker to fill its now nearly empty tanks before proceeding on its mission. This {{was referred to as}} the LTTR (for [...] "Launch To Tanker Rendezvous") profile. [...] LTTR had the added advantage of providing an operational test of the Blackbird's refueling capability within minutes after takeoff, enabling a Return-To-Launch-Site abort capability if necessary. At its most efficient altitude and speed, the Blackbird was capable of flying for many hours without refueling. The SR-71 used a special fuel, JP-7, with a very high flash point to withstand the extreme skin temperatures generated during Mach 3+ <b>cruise</b> <b>flight.</b> [...] While JP-7 could be used by other aircraft, its burn characteristics posed problems in certain situations (such as high-altitude, emergency engine starts) that made it less than optimal for aircraft other than the SR-71.|$|E
