5|$|After the Danish Reformation, {{involving}} {{the suppression of}} the Catholic bishopric in 1536, the city enjoyed a sustained period of prosperity from the 1530s to the mid-17th century, becoming northern Funen's commercial centre. One of the main sources of income was the sale of cattle, providing substantial funds for the construction of fine half-timbered houses for the local merchants. The local nobility also participated in the city's development by building residences where they spent the winter months. But the city's prosperity <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>abrupt</b> end in the late 1650s heavy taxes were imposed {{after the end of the}} Swedish Wars.

A brief, low-key European tour was undertaken in June and July 1980, featuring a stripped-down set without the usual lengthy jams and solos. On 27 June, at a show in Nuremberg, Germany, the concert <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>abrupt</b> halt {{in the middle of}} the third song, when Bonham collapsed onstage and was rushed to hospital.

5|$|The {{battle has}} been {{described}} {{as one of the most}} decisive of the ancient world. The forces of Athens and Thebes were destroyed, and continued resistance was impossible; the war therefore <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>abrupt</b> end. Philip was able to impose a settlement upon Greece, which all states accepted, with the exception of Sparta. The League of Corinth, formed as a result, made all participants allies of Macedon and each other, with Philip as the guarantor of the peace. In turn, Philip was voted as strategos (general) for a pan-Hellenic war against the Persian Empire, which he had long planned. However, before he was able to take charge of the campaign, Philip was assassinated, and the kingdom of Macedon and responsibility for the war with Persia passed instead to his son Alexander.|$|E
5|$|The {{design was}} reimagined in 1944, {{intended}} to operate {{along with the}} s and proposed aircraft carriers to make up powerful task forces able to challenge the American fleet. In this role it {{would need to be}} a more powerful ship than the original design, taking over for the now-cancelled Kronstadts. They were intended to fend off enemy attacks and protect the carriers when bad weather prevented flying. A series of at least four were planned, and Stalingrad finally began construction in 1951. Supported primarily by Joseph Stalin and opposed by a considerable part of the naval staff, the project <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>abrupt</b> end with his death in 1953. By this time a second example was under construction and abandoned on the slipway, while a third was never started. The partially completed Stalingrad ended as a target ship for testing anti-ship missiles, before being broken up around 1962.|$|E
5|$|During 1928–1973, the Soviet Union {{was growing}} {{economically}} {{at a pace}} that would eventually catch up with the United States and Western Europe. This was true despite the advantage the United States had — the USSR was hampered by the effects of World War II, which had left most of Western USSR in ruins. In 1973, the process of catching up {{with the rest of the}} West <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>abrupt</b> end, and 1973 was seen by some scholars as the start of the Era of Stagnation. The beginning of the stagnation coincided with a financial crisis in Western Europe and the U.S. By the early 1970s, the Soviet Union had the world's second largest industrial capacity, and produced more steel, oil, pig-iron, cement and tractors than any other country. Before 1973, the Soviet economy was expanding at faster rate than that of the American economy (albeit by a very small margin). The USSR also kept a steady pace with the economies of Western Europe. Between 1964 and 1973, the Soviet economy stood at roughly half the output per head of Western Europe and a little more than one third that of the U.S.|$|E

5|$|Karađorđe's {{descendants}} {{adopted the}} surname Karađorđević in his honour. His murder {{resulted in a}} violent, decades-long feud between his descendants and those of Obrenović, with the Serbian throne changing hands several times. The feud <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>abrupt</b> end in June 1903, when rebellious Royal Serbian Army officers killed the Obrenović king, Alexander, and his wife, Queen Draga, thereby rendering the Obrenović line extinct. Karađorđe's grandson, Peter Karađorđević, then ascended to the throne. In order to tie himself to his grandfather's legacy, Peter commissioned a bronze crown cast from a piece of Karađorđe's first cannon. In addition, the Order of Karađorđe's Star was introduced as Serbia's highest state decoration. The first feature-length film to emerge from Serbia and the Balkans, whose plot revolves around Karađorđe and his actions before, {{during and after the}} First Serbian Uprising, was released in 1911. Work soon began on the construction of the Church of Saint George, a Karađorđević dynasty mausoleum at Oplenac, near Topola. In 1923, Karađorđe's head was repatriated from Greece and reunited {{with the rest of his}} body. His remains were buried in a white marble sarcophagus within the church in 1930.|$|E
5|$|Some {{important}} roads {{cross the}} site of the new city. Most important of these is Watling Street from London to Chester. Originally, the Northampton to London road joined the Watling Street at Fenny Stratford, via Broughton and Simpson. The Oxford to Cambridge route came through Stony Stratford, Wolverton and Newport Pagnell. Unfortunately, the heavy clay soils, poor drainage and many streams made these routes frequently impassable in winter. The Hockliffe to Dunchurch stretch of Watling Street became a (paved) Turnpike in 1706 (the first turnpike to be approved by parliament). Simpson remained a quagmire and in 1870 the new Northampton/London turnpike diverted away at Broughton to take the higher route through Wavendon and Woburn Sands to join Watling Street near Hockliffe. On the east/west route, the Stony Stratford to Newport Pagnell turnpike of 1814 extended the Woodstock, Oxfordshire/Bicester/Stony Stratford turnpike of 1768. Turnpikes provided a major boost to the economy of Fenny Stratford and particularly Stony Stratford. In the stage coach era, Stony Stratford was a major resting place and exchange point with the east/west route. In the early 19th century, over 30 coaches a day stopped here. That traffic <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>abrupt</b> end in 1838 when the London–Birmingham Railway (now the West Coast Main Line) opened at nearby Wolverton.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} Creangă's death, efforts began {{to collect his}} {{manuscript}} writings and the updated versions of his printed works. This project involved his son Constantin, alongside A. D. Xenopol, Grigore Alexandrescu and Eduard Gruber, the latter of whom obtained the works from Tinca Vartic. The first edition was published as two volumes, in 1890–1892, but the project <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>abrupt</b> halt due to Gruber's insanity and death. Creangă's final known work, the fragment of Făt-frumos, fiul iepei, was published by Convorbiri Literare in 1898. The Gruber copies were sold to a Dr. Mendel, and {{only a part of}} them was recovered by exegetes, alongside various fragments accidentally discovered at Iași market, where they were being used for wrapping paper. The collection, structured into a whole by folklorist Gheorghe T. Kirileanu, was published by Editura Minerva in 1902 and 1906. In addition to being mentioned in the memoirs of several prominent Junimists, Creangă had his political career fictionalized and satirized by Iacob Negruzzi, who transformed him, as Popa Smântână, into a character of his satirical poems Electorale ("Electorals"). The same author referred to his counterpart in one of his epigrams.|$|E

5|$|In 1976, the Dunstan Government {{stepped up}} its {{legislative}} efforts. Some bills, {{such as the one}} to remove the sodomy law and decriminalise male homosexuality, had been initially blocked by the Legislative Council. However, the bill to abolish capital punishment passed with ease, and the homosexuality law reforms eventually passed in September. Rape law was properly codified and defined as a crime within marriage {{for the first time in}} Australia. Shopping hours, previously the most restrictive in the nation, became the most open. Following a royal commission, Friday night shopping was introduced for the city and Thursday night shopping for the suburbs. The deposits on beverage containers was finally passed. The first signs of Monarto's eventual failure began to appear: birth rates started dropping significantly, immigration slowed and the economy was stagnant. South Australia's robust population growth, previously the highest per capita among the states, <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>abrupt</b> halt. However, state money continued to be poured into the Monarto project, despite the fact that the Whitlam government cut funding to $600,000 in 1975, while his Liberal successor Malcolm Fraser gave nothing at all the following year. However, by the time Monarto was eventually scrapped after Dunstan's departure, no less than $20 million had been used to buy land, plant trees and formulate development plans, and the failed project is often seen as Dunstan's greatest failure. In addition, the federal government removed subsidies for shipbuilding at Whyalla, forcing the operations to be scaled down.|$|E
