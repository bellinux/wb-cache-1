5|$|According to biographer C. Douglas Kroll, {{the first}} {{evidence}} of a form of football at the United States Naval Academy came in 1857, but the school's cadets lost interest in the game shortly afterward. However, {{it is widely believed}} by football researchers that the playing of intercollegiate football began in November 1869, when a player at Rutgers University challenged another player at the nearby <b>College</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> Jersey (now Princeton). The contest more closely resembled soccer, with teams scoring by kicking the ball into the opponent's net, and lacked a uniform rules structure. The game developed slowly; the first rules were drafted in October 1873, and only consisted of twelve guidelines. Even though the number of teams participating in the sport increased, the game was still effectively controlled by the <b>College</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> Jersey, who claimed eight national championships in ten years. Only Yale presented any form of challenge, claiming four national championships in the same time period.|$|E
5|$|Asch was shy when {{he moved}} to the United States and did not speak English fluently. He went to the {{neighborhood}} public school, P.S. 147, to attend 6th grade. As a result of the language barrier, Asch had a very difficult time understanding in class. He learned English by reading Charles Dickens. Asch later attended Townsend Harris High School, a very selective high school attached to the City <b>College</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York. After high school, he attended the City <b>College</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York, majoring in both literature and science. He became interested in psychology towards the end of his undergraduate career after reading the work of William James and a few philosophers. In 1928, when he was 21 years old, he received his Bachelor of Science.|$|E
5|$|George Hammell Cook (1818-1889), a {{professor}} of chemistry and natural sciences, influenced the state to select Rutgers over the <b>College</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> Jersey (now Princeton University). Cook was appointed state geologist in 1864 and later became the college's vice president. With the college's land grant status and new funding for scientific studies, Cook expanded his research and teaching into geology and agriculture.|$|E

5|$|While the {{controversy}} raged, American Presbyterians were also concerned with expanding their influence. In 1740, a New York Board of the Society in Scotland for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge was established. Four years later, David Brainerd was assigned as a missionary to the Native Americans.

5|$|After {{graduating from}} high school in 1979, Obama moved to Los Angeles to attend Occidental College. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to {{participate}} in the disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation's policy of apartheid. In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in Pakistan and India for three weeks. Later in 1981, he transferred as a junior to Columbia University in New York City, where he majored in political science with a specialty in international relations and in English literature and lived off-campus on West 109th Street. He graduated with a BA degree in 1983 and worked for about a year at the Business International Corporation, where he was a financial researcher and writer, then as a project coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group on the City <b>College</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York campus for three months in 1985.|$|E

5|$|As of 2014, {{there have}} been 13 Nobel laureates {{affiliated}} with the City University of New York (CUNY). CUNY considers any laureate who attended one of its senior colleges as an affiliated laureate. Arthur Kornberg, who graduated from the City <b>College</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York, a senior college of CUNY, in 1937, was the first CUNY laureate, winning the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1959. Herbert A. Hauptman and Jerome Karle, both of whom graduated from the City College in 1937 with Kornberg, jointly won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1985, the only CUNY laureates to do so. Six CUNY laureates have won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, {{more than any other}} category. Ten of the CUNY laureates graduated from the City College, two laureates, Rosalyn Sussman Yalow and Gertrude B. Elion, graduated from Hunter College, another CUNY senior college, and one laureate, Stanley Cohen, graduated from Brooklyn College, one of CUNY's senior colleges, in 1943.|$|E
5|$|Born in Albemarle County, Virginia to John Breckinridge (1760-1806) and Mary Hopkins Cabell Breckinridge (1769-1858), Breckinridge {{moved to}} Kentucky {{with his parents}} in 1793. When John Breckinridge {{was elected to the}} U.S. Senate in 1801, Cabell {{traveled}} with him to Washington, D.C., and completed preparatory studies at New London Academy (now Colby–Sawyer College). In 1806, he enrolled in the <b>College</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> Jersey (now Princeton University). His studies were interrupted in 1807 when he participated in a student protest against the strict rules and rigorous curriculum at the institution, but after a year-long break, he returned and completed his bachelor's degree in 1810. After graduation, he married Mary Clay Smith, daughter of Samuel Stanhope Smith, the university's president.|$|E
5|$|Davy Bisslik {{represented}} Aruba as {{a swimmer}} in the men's 100meters butterfly, {{and was the}} only male Aruban athlete participating in swimming that year. Born in Aruba, Bisslik participated in the athletic programs at The <b>College</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> Jersey, and attended the 2000 Sydney Olympics on Aruba's behalf in the men's 50meters freestyle, where he ranked 62nd during the qualification round. Bisslik returned to the Olympics at age 22, although he entered in a different event entirely. During the qualification round on August 19, Bisslik competed against seven other athletes. He finished the event in 57.85seconds, ranking last in his heat behind Guam's Daniel O'Keeffe (57.39seconds), who placed seventh, and Indonesia's Andy Wibowo (56.86seconds) who placed sixth. His heat was led by Czech swimmer Michal Rubáček (54.87seconds) and Uzbekistan's Oleg Lyashko (55.90seconds). Of the 59 participants in the qualification round, Bisslik ranked 56th. He did not advance to later heats.|$|E

5|$|Difficulties {{with the}} {{diffusers}} and pumps paled into insignificance besides {{those with the}} porous barrier. In order to work, the gaseous diffusion process required a barrier with microscopic holes, but not subject to plugging. It had to be extremely porous, but strong enough to handle the high pressures. And, like everything else, it had to resist corrosion from uranium hexafluoride. The latter criterion suggested a nickel barrier. Foster C. Nix at the Bell Telephone Laboratories experimented with nickel powder, while Edward O. Norris at the C. O. Jelliff Manufacturing Corporation and Edward Adler at the City <b>College</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York worked on a design with electroplated metallic nickel. Norris was an English interior decorator, who had developed a very fine metal mesh for use with a spray gun. Their design appeared too brittle and fragile for the proposed use, particularly on the higher stages of enrichment, but there was hope {{that this could be}} overcome.|$|E
5|$|Discussions {{regarding}} {{the founding of}} a college in the Province of New York began as early as 1704, at which time Colonel Lewis Morris wrote to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, the missionary arm of the Church of England, persuading the society that New York City was an ideal community in which to establish a college. However, {{it was not until}} the founding of the <b>College</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> Jersey (the present Princeton University) across the Hudson River in New Jersey that the City of New York seriously consider founding a college. In 1746, an act was passed by the general assembly of New York to raise funds for the foundation of a new college. In 1751, the assembly appointed a commission of ten New York residents, seven of whom were members of the Church of England, to direct the funds accrued by the state lottery towards the foundation of a college.|$|E
5|$|In 1801, when Breckinridge was 12 years old, {{his father}} {{was elected to the}} U.S. Senate. The family moved to Bedford County, Virginia, where they lived with {{relatives}} in order to be closer to the elder Breckinridge during the congressional session at Washington, D.C.. While there, Cabell Breckinridge attended New London Academy (now Colby–Sawyer College). A case of measles prevented him from attending William and Mary College (now College of William & Mary), his father's alma mater, where his cousin, future Congressman James Breckinridge, was enrolled. In 1803, he accompanied his father to the capital where he witnessed the debates over the Louisiana Purchase before returning to college in October. After Congress adjourned in March, John Breckinridge met his son in Virginia, and they arrived back at Cabell's Dale, the family estate near Lexington, on April 18, 1804. He did not return to Virginia with his father in late 1804, instead pursuing preparatory studies under Colonel Samuel Wilson in advance of his enrollment at the <b>College</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> Jersey (now Princeton University).|$|E
