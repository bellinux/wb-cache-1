40|$|Background. Recent {{guidelines}} for infant cardiopulmonary resuscitation emphasize that all rescuers should minimize interruption of chest <b>compressions,</b> even for endotracheal intubation. We compared {{the utility of}} the Pentax-AWS Airwayscope (AWS) with the Glidescope (GS) during chest <b>compressions</b> on an infant manikin. Methods. Twenty-four anesthesiologists with more than two years of experience performed tracheal intubation on an infant manikin using the AWS and GS, with or without chest <b>compressions.</b> Results. In GS trials, none of the participants failed without <b>compressions,</b> while three failed with <b>compressions.</b> In AWS trials, all participants succeeded regardless of chest <b>compressions.</b> Intubation time was significantly longer with chest <b>compressions</b> with the GS (P< 0. 05), but not with the AWS. Difficulty of operation on a visual analog scale (VAS) for laryngoscopy did not increase significantly with chest <b>compressions</b> with either the GS or the AWS, while the VAS for tube passage through the glottis increased with <b>compressions</b> with the GS, but not with the AWS. Conclusion. We conclude that in infant simulations managed by anesthesiologists, the AWS performed better than the GS for endotracheal intubation with chest <b>compressions...</b>|$|R

40|$|Starting chest <b>compressions</b> {{immediately}} after a defibrillation shock might be harmful, if the victim {{already had a}} return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and yet was still being subjected to external <b>compressions</b> at the same time. The objective {{of this study was}} to study the influence of chest <b>compressions</b> on circulation during the peri-cardiac arrest period. Prospective, randomized controlled study. Animal experimental center in Peking Union Medical Collage Hospital, Beijing, China. Healthy 3 -month-old male domestic pigs. 44 pigs (28 ± 2 kg) were randomly assigned to three groups: Group I (non-arrested with <b>compressions)</b> (n = 12); Group II (arrested with <b>compressions</b> only) (n = 12); Group III (ROSC after <b>compressions</b> and defibrillation) (n = 20). In Groups I and II, <b>compressions</b> were performed to a depth of 5 cm (Ia and IIa, n = 6) or a depth of 3 cm (Ib and IIb, n = 6) respectively, while in Group III, the animals which had just achieved ROSC (n = 18) were compressed to a depth of 5 cm (IIIa, n = 6), a depth of 3 cm (IIIb, n = 6), or had no <b>compressions</b> (IIIc, n = 6). Hemodynamic parameters were collected and analyzed. Hemodynamics were statistically different between Groups Ia and Ib when different depths of <b>compressions</b> were performed (p < 0. 05). In Group II, <b>compressions</b> were beneficial and hemodynamics correlated with the depth of <b>compressions</b> (p < 0. 05). In Group III, <b>compressions</b> that continued after ROSC produced a reduction in arterial pressure (p < 0. 05). Chest <b>compressions</b> might be detrimental to hemodynamics in the early post-ROSC stage.

50|$|CPR {{involves}} chest <b>compressions</b> {{for adults}} between 5 cm and 6 cm deep {{and at a}} rate of at least 100 to 120 per minute. The rescuer may also provide artificial ventilation by either exhaling air into the subject's mouth or nose (mouth-to-mouth resuscitation) or using a device that pushes air into the subject's lungs (mechanical ventilation). Current recommendations place emphasis on early and high-quality chest <b>compressions</b> over artificial ventilation; a simplified CPR method involving chest <b>compressions</b> only is recommended for untrained rescuers. In children, however, only doing <b>compressions</b> may result in worse outcomes.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, the American Heart Association and International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation updated their CPR guidelines. The {{importance}} {{of high quality}} CPR (sufficient rate and depth without excessively ventilating) was emphasized. The order of interventions was changed for all age groups except newborns from airway, breathing, chest <b>compressions</b> (ABC) to chest <b>compressions,</b> airway, breathing (CAB). An exception to this recommendation is for those {{believed to be in}} a respiratory arrest (airway obstruction, drug overdose, etc.). The most important aspect of CPR are: few interruptions of chest <b>compressions,</b> a sufficient speed and depth of <b>compressions,</b> completely relaxing pressure between <b>compressions,</b> and not ventilating too much. It is unclear if a few minutes of CPR before defibrillation results in different outcomes than immediate defibrillation.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess cardiopulmonary resuscitation quality and rescuer fatigue when rescuers perform one or two minutes of continuous chest <b>compressions.</b> METHODS: This prospective crossover study included 148 lay rescuers who were continuously trained in a cardiopulmonary resuscitation course. The subjects underwent a 120 -min training program comprising continuous chest <b>compressions.</b> After the course, half of the volunteers performed one minute of continuous chest <b>compressions,</b> and the others performed two minutes, both on a manikin model. After 30 minutes, the volunteers who had previously performed one minute now performed two minutes on the same manikin and vice versa. RESULTS: A comparison of continuous chest <b>compressions</b> performed for one and two minutes, respectively, showed that there were significant differences in the average rate of <b>compressions</b> per minute (121 vs. 124), the percentage of <b>compressions</b> of appropriate depth (76 % vs. 54 %), the average depth (53 vs. 47 mm), and the number of <b>compressions</b> with no errors (62 vs. 47 %). No parameters were significantly different when comparing participants who performed regular physical activity with those who did not and participants who had a normal body mass index with overweight/obese participants. CONCLUSION: The quality of continuous chest <b>compressions</b> by lay rescuers is superior when it is performed for one minute rather than for two minutes, independent of the body mass index or regular physical activity, even if they are continuously trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It is beneficial to rotate rescuers every minute when performing continuous chest <b>compressions</b> to provide higher quality and to achieve greater success in assisting a victim of cardiac arrest...|$|R
5|$|When the rarefication wave {{reaches the}} other (open) {{end of the}} tube, air rushes in to fill the slight vacuum. A {{little more than a}} 'neutral' amount of air enters the tube and causes a <b>compression</b> wave to travel back up the tube (image 4). Once the <b>compression</b> wave reaches the {{mouthpiece}} end of the 'tube', it is reflected again back down the pipe. However at this time, either because the <b>compression</b> wave 'bumped' the reed or because of the natural vibration cycle of the reed, the gap opens and another 'puff' of air is sent down the pipe.|$|E

40|$|Chest <b>compressions</b> in {{cardiopulmonary}} resuscitation are {{of utmost importance}} although not without a risk. Many injuries are described but the incidence of these is hard to define due to methodological differences. It is strenuous to perform chest <b>compressions</b> and therefore mechanical chest <b>compressions</b> have been looked upon with interest. This thesis presents new insights on the panorama and incidence of injuries in modern CPR and a comparison of safety and efficacy between manual chest <b>compressions</b> and mechanical chest <b>compressions</b> with the LUCAS™ device. We also evaluated if computed tomography could be an aid in the detection of these injuries. Two pilot trials were conducted and one presented no difference in early survival with 26 % and 31 % having return of spontaneous circulation when comparing manual chest <b>compressions</b> with the LUCAS device in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The other revealed no difference in autopsy-detected injuries. A third multicentre autopsy trial revealed that in patients treated with manual chest <b>compressions</b> 78. 3 % {{had at least one}} injury and 63. 9 % had at least one rib fracture. The corresponding numbers for patients treated with the LUCAS device was 92. 8 % (p = 0. 002) and 77. 7 % (p= 0. 022). Sternal fractures occurred in 54. 2 % and in 58. 3 % of the cases treated with manual chest <b>compressions</b> and the LUCAS device respectively (p = 0. 556). The median number of rib fractures was 7 in the group receiving manual chest <b>compressions</b> and 6 in the group receiving chest <b>compressions</b> with the LUCAS device. In 31 cases a computed tomography was conducted prior to autopsy and we found a very strong correlation in the discrimination of patients with or without rib fractures (kappa= 0. 83). Mean difference between the two methods in detecting rib fractures was 0. 16. The detection of other injuries did not have a strong correlation. In conclusion there is no difference in early survival between the two methods and mechanical chest <b>compressions</b> adds 14 - 15 % more patients with rib fractures but the amount of rib fractures, sternal fractures and other injuries is equal. CT can aid but not replace autopsies in the detection of these injuries...|$|R
