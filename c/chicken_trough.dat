The ongoing {{traffic jam}} present {{around the town}} square of {{downtown}} Murfreesboro has led to efforts to develop what is being called [...] "New Square" [...] in an old shopping center, prone to flooding, {{off one of the}} bypasses. The project was initiated by Judy Ull, proprietor of Thickset Pants, though she does not yet have any pants in stock, only artistic renderings of the envisioned square. Another confirmed tenant thus far is Old Books, run by Juanita Hazelchest, which is a very specific kind of used book store, only offering books of a specific vintage, which means that many of the items for sale are falling apart or eaten through with bugs. Leslie Dollarhyde, famous seller of fox-faced cats—cats bred to look like foxes in the face (as well as the accidental half-fox-faced cats)--was to have established her operation in the old well house. However, the federal government accused Dollarhyde of practicing gene splicing without a license and attempted to confiscate Murfreesboro's population of fox-faced cats. Though Jackie encouraged people to turn in their animals to one of the three collection sites in town, Dollarhyde, Inky (her lover), and several enthusiastic pet owners holed themselves up in Big Lots as an act of resistance. The federal government ended up backing down from their demands, but at the present, Dollarhyde's future with the New Square operation is in question. In addition to these three, Judy Ull worked to attract a restaurant to the site, initially talking with Orange <b>Chicken</b> <b>Trough,</b> a Chinese restaurant in Smyrna, before announcing the establishment of Golden Monster II at New Square. Though owned by the same people who operate the Golden Monster Chinese buffet restaurant on the Old Square, Golden Monster II offers Brazilian cuisine.|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} predict the true metabolizable energy (TMEn) of compounded starter feeds of broiler <b>chickens</b> <b>trough</b> their chemical composition using precision-feeding method of Sibbald in male boilers. In the first, eight compounded feed samples provided from eight feed plants and their chemical composition determined in laboratory. Results of chemical composition showed that average values of dry matter, crude protein, ether extract, crude ash, crude fiber, calcium and phosphorus were 90. 47, 20. 99, 2. 79, 2. 88, 6. 69, 1. 08 and 0. 49 percent, respectively with coefficient of variation between 2. 01 to 13. 29 percent. The average value of TMEn in compounded starter feeds was also obtained 3006 Kcal/kg with variation from 2884 to 3275 Kcal/kg and differences between them were significant. The variation between metabolizability values in the compounded feeds was 0. 7 to 0. 8 percent and differences between their values were not significant. The average value of dry matter true metabolizability in starter feeds was obtained as 54 percent and those having higher crude fiber, showed lower dry matter true metabolizability. The TME and TMEn values of compounded starter feeds showed a negative correlation as 0. 38 and 0. 59 percent with crude ash of feeds, so that the feeds containing higher crude ash had lower TME and TMEn values. Regression analysis showed that we can predict the TMEn value of broiler compounded starter feeds via regression equations from crude ash, crude protein, calcium and phosphorus contents of feeds from their crude ash, crude protein, calcium and phosphorus with R 2 value as 0. 67 (P= 0. 002) ...|$|R
40|$|Water troughs {{from deep}} litter and caged <b>chicken</b> water <b>troughs</b> (drinkers) fixed {{to each of}} the {{different}} 3 -tier cages containing layer chickens in Farms A, B and C were subjected to a 7 -day study which involved the monitoring of poultry farm hygiene. Drinkers were washed before filling with water on Day 1. For Days 3, 5 and 7 water was served without prior washing. The occurrence and characterization of the bacteria isolates were investigated and data obtained were analyzed and compared. For the bacterial count on Day 1, for layer chickens on cage system, no significant differences (p> 0. 05) among the farms and between the farms tier interactions. On Day 3, no significant difference (p> 0. 05) among the parameters. On Day 5, there was significant difference (p 0. 05) among the tiers nor between the interactions of the farms and tiers. The bacterial count in water <b>troughs</b> of layer <b>chickens</b> in deep litter system, on Day 1, had no significant differences (p> 0. 05) between the farms, water troughs and their interactions. On Day 3, no significant difference (p> 0. 05) among the parameters. On Days 5 and 7, there were significant difference (p Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermis, Klebsiella sp., Salmonella sp., Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus salivarius and Corynebacterium sp. Farm B had Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermis, Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium sp., Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis and Klebsiella sp. while for Farm C, apart from the prevalent bacteria isolates obtained in Farms A and B, additional 2 bacterial isolates, Lactobacillus salivarius and Pseudomonas aeuriginosa were found. In conclusion, water troughs when cleaned on daily basis carry minimum bacterial load. Those left for 3, 5 and 7 days uncleaned had progressively high bacterial loads, suggesting that the flock of birds and the consumers of the eggs and meat from the chickens are at risk of bacterial infection unless strict farm hygiene is ensured through regular monitoring...|$|R
