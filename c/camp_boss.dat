Although {{he had hoped to}} go to Alaska, he was {{assigned}} that year to the Northern Rocky Mountain Experiment Station at Missoula, Montana. Marshall's research at the experimental station focused on the dynamics of forest regeneration after fires. He had to fight a widespread fire after a July storm started more than 150fires in Idaho's Kaniksu National Forest. He was put in charge of supporting and provisioning one of the crews led by the Forest Service. As he later recalled, Marshall worked [...] "18 to 20hours a day as time-keeper, Chief of Commissary, <b>Camp</b> <b>Boss,</b> and Inspector of the fire line". [...] Spending time with loggers and fire fighters, and seeing the conditions under which they worked, Marshall learned vital lessons about labor issues and natural resource use. At the experimental station, Marshall became interested in the unsafe conditions for many working Americans. He began to develop [...] liberal and socialist philosophies.|$|E

The short-statured Mr. Wainwright, who spoke with Shakespearean diction and fancied himself an amateur detective (as a result of the famous mystery novels his company published), eventually let Henry stay with the firm, after the latter proved adept in helping him solve the mystery of Sara's stolen purse. Wainwright no longer appeared in person after the first season, but was referred to. Later, {{at the start of the}} fifth season, Graham Jarvis began appearing as Wainwright in a few guest appearances.|$|R

5000|$|The Rivers stories {{take the}} form of first-person {{narratives}} by the protagonist told to companions whose identities vary, but who have in common the fact that their contributions to the conversation are omitted, and must be inferred from those of Rivers. Every story is an anecdote from Rivers' career as a conductor of time safaris to previous eras, both to hunt prehistoric creatures and for scientific purposes (and, occasionally, anti-scientific purposes). In addition to Rivers, the main recurring characters include fellow members of his safari firm, including his partner Chandra Aiyar, <b>camp</b> <b>boss</b> Beauregard Black, and cook Ming. In most instances, the actions of their human clients prove more troublesome than those of the extinct fauna, a theme set in [...] "Faunas", a 1968 poem by de Camp that precedes the stories. An afterword by the author tells how he came to write the series.|$|E

The doctor {{had been one of the}} ten men who had helped to clear out the camp. When not professionally employed he worked at a claim some distance from that of Ned Hampton's party, and as he and his partners messed together instead of taking their meals at either of the saloons Ned seldom saw him.

5000|$|A young orphan boy, whose name, age, and {{background}} are {{unknown in the}} beginning of the book, is struggling to make ends meet for himself. He bounces from migrant family to migrant family, surviving by picking crops, but he makes no profit due to his wages being taken by the families he stays with. Near the beginning of the book, he makes his first friend, a girl named Raidy. Raidy befriends him and says he should have a name. Before she can decide on one, their friendship is cut short when Raidy is killed in a farming accident. Exhausted, hungry, and distraught over his only friend's death, the boy takes off on his own and collapses onto the ground without knowing or caring where he is or if he will survive. He is in Montana, where he is found by a woman named [...] "Boss" [...] and her dog Jupiter. Boss is a modern-day shepherd, tending a flock of 900 sheep with the help of two dogs, and she brings the boy to her camp, caring for him until he recovers. <b>Boss's</b> <b>camp</b> tender, Tex explains to the boy how Boss's son, Ben, was killed by a bear and that Boss sometimes hunts the bear that killed her son. He talks to the boy, motivating him to keep the place clean and do what Ben would have done for Boss. Pointing to a random page in the Bible, the boy chooses the name [...] "David," [...] which Boss takes a sign that she is supposed to help him (David was also a shepherd). Angie, Ben's widow, brings David some of Ben's old clothing, gives him a haircut, and intends to teach him how to read and write. Throughout the story there is a pattern: each person that David meets expresses interest in helping him. David is understandably quite skeptical of people's intentions and feels like he's only a stray or a burden. However, he grows from a loner to someone who welcomes love and other people into his life. He also learns about the give and take of civilization, and how to handle the responsibility of caring for Boss's sheep and doing chores as he accepts help from others to meet his own needs and overcome his hardships.|$|R

5000|$|When the Cariboo Gold Rush {{was in full}} swing, {{there was}} demand for an easier route for {{shipping}} and passenger travel to the remote goldfields towns around Barkerville, by then the largest town in the Interior. Waddington applied for a license to construct a wagon road {{from the head of}} Bute Inlet to Fort Alexandria on the Fraser and the existing roads from there to the goldfields and southwards. He first conceived of the idea in 1862 and struggled financially with the project until 1864, when work crews began work on the road and came into conflict with warriors Tsilhqot'in warriors who they had hired to help. The Tsilhqot'in were hungry and the survivors of the devastating Great Smallpox of 1862 which had destroyed the indigenous population of British Columbia in vast numbers. The Tshilqot'in had been among the hardest hit, with an estimated 90% wiped out in a few short weeks. When the warriors realized what they were building, they protested to the work <b>camp</b> <b>boss,</b> who threatened them with smallpox.|$|E
5000|$|As for {{the second}} criticism, the {{reliance}} on oral history does not address many of {{the facts of the}} case. Voutilainen was a trapper who had maintained trap lines in the Onion Lake area for several years, and thus, intimately familiar with the area. [...] How could an experienced trapper with an intimate knowledge of the local environment fall through ice and drown in (at most) three and a half feet of water? The testimony of the official coroner, Dr. Crozier, also raises doubts. Not only was his testimony highly agitated and hostile, but Crozier also belonged to an anti-union [...] "citizens' group" [...] formed {{around the time of the}} Winnipeg General Strike. Other inconsistencies include contradictory statements from the <b>camp</b> <b>boss,</b> Maki, and evidence of injuries on the bodies suggesting a struggle before their drowning. [...] That violent methods were used by employers, the authorities, and/or vigilantes to disrupt or discourage union activity around this time in North America is not unusual. Numerous instances such as the lynching of Frank Little, the case of Sacco and Vanzetti, the Everett Massacre, or the Estevan Riot, to name only a few, clearly show that violent and brutal means were common place in class conflict.|$|E
40|$|Fishing for {{shrimp in}} San Francisco Bay started about 1869. The first {{fishermen}} were Italians {{and there were}} 8 boats engaged in the fishery. They used small meshed seines 60 feet long and 8 feet deep with a bag in the center. The nets were used in deep water and took very few small shrimp or fish. They usually took from 50 to 75 pounds of shrimp in a haul and made from 3 to 5 hauls on each tide. In 1871 the Chinese introduced the Chinese shrimp net and began to take large quantities of shrimp, but as the market for fresh shrimp has always been limited, the greater portion of the catches was dried for export to China. The Chinese fished in Tomales Bay and San Francisco Bay. The Tomales Bay camps were abandoned during the early nineties. In 1885 public opinion became aroused against the Chinese nets, as they took large quantities of young fish, and the controversy on this subject continued until 1901, when the Legislature passed a law placing a closed season on shrimp fishing for the months of May, June, July and August. The Chinese hired attorneys to fight this. A boat crew was arrested for a test case, which the State won through all the courts {{up to and including}} the United States Supreme Court. In 1905 the shrimp interests managed to get the four-month closed season removed, {{but at the same time}} it was made unlawful to export dried shrimps. In 1909 a closed season of three months, June, July and August, was again adopted, and in 1911 the use of the Chinese nets was prohibited altogether. During the period from 1900 to 1911 there was constant trouble over the shrimp fishing. Fish and game deputies were arresting the Chinese crews and there was continual agitation. In 1915 the backers of the Chinese put through a bill which again allowed shrimp fishing on south San Francisco Bay (District 13) with the Chinese shrimp nets. At about the same time a trawl was put in use in the northern end of the bay. The law prohibiting the exportation of dried shrimps was retained until 1919, when it was repealed. From 1919 to the present time Chinese shrimp nets have been used in District 13, the shrimp trawls in District 12, and not more than one-half of any one catch could be dried legally. Shrimp fishing is carried on under several methods of organization. Frank Spenger Company and Quan Brothers maintain their own camps and buy the shrimps from the trawlers, who fish for them at a definite price per pound. The fishermen in this case have no more interest in the shrimps after they have delivered them. The Chinese camps in South San Francisco are organized under three working plans. The larger number of camps are owned by Chinese companies maintaining offices in Chinatown. These camps are leased to a group of men who work on shares among themselves. The company which owns the camp is paid for its use by handling the total catch at a definite price which allows it a profit. The price paid to the camps for fresh shrimps, for instance, has been 5 ½ cents per pound for a number of years. The camp crew maintains the boats, gear and buildings, and manages its own commissary as a community affair. One man is usually <b>camp</b> <b>boss</b> and has the responsibility of supervising the activities of the camp. There are two camps which depart from this procedure. In one of these, two men own the camp and gear and pay definite wages and found to the crew, and in the other, two men own the boat and gear and work in partnership, sometimes hiring a third man. The present day camps vary from a 2 man outfit fishing 20 nets to a camp of 8 men using 50 nets. The first of September is the beginning of the fiscal year in the camps. At this time the shareholders are at liberty to break away if they choose and go to some other camp. Very few groups stay together more than a year, and there is considerable shifting around, though few men leave the fishery and very few new men come in. The beds maintained by each company are held from year to year. They were originally laid out on a first-come-first-served basis. There are unwritten rules concerning the staking of new beds. A new bed must be far enough away so it will not "cork" an old bed. "Claim jumping" is rare, but a controversy over this between two large companies nearly precipitated a tong war in 1930. The matter was, however, amicably arranged. A bed does not necessarily have to be operated to be held. The larger companies generally have two or more beds, although they seldom work more than one. In some portions of the bay the beds can be used only during the summer due to weather conditions, and these are left idle during the winter...|$|E
