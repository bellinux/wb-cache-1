While the exact mechanisms of tree death are still unknown, even without fire (Anderegg et al. 2015), statistical models of fire-caused tree mortality based on fire injuries and tree size are useful and necessary until process-based models are developed (Butler and Dickinson 2010, Kavanagh et al. 2010).|$|E

The plots included a range of genetic types established on north- and south-facing aspects. Modelled carbon was highly correlated with directly measured <b>crown,</b> <b>stem,</b> and above ground biomass data, with r = 0. 92, 0. 97 and 0. 98, respectively. LiDAR canopy percentile height (P 30) and cover, based on all returns above 0. 5 m, explained 81, 88, and 93 % of the variation in directly measured <b>crown,</b> <b>stem,</b> and above ground live carbon and 75, 89 and 88 % of the modelled carbon, respectively. LAI (all surfaces) ranged between 8. 8 – 19. 1 in the 10 plots measured at age 9 years. The difference in canopy percentile heights (P 95 –P 30) and cover based on first returns explained 80 % of the variation in total LAI.

Link) are {{two common}} invasive {{species of the}} Pacific Northwest. While many methods currently exist to control these two species, both posses inherent characteristics and structures making them resistant to existent methods in the forms of aggressive vegetative growth and resprouting from root fragments and large persistent seed banks. The goal of this thesis is to explore the potential application of solarization as a control method for these two species. In a field trial, the effectiveness of solarization was to tested against several existent control methods focusing on the stem and root crown survivorship. In a subsequent greenhouse experiment, the seed banks of R. armeniacus and C. scoparius were subjected to solarization at varying soil temperatures. Results indicate that solarization does have the potential of killing root crowns and reducing the seed banks of R. armeniacus and C. scoparius. Clear plastic solarization {{was found to be}} more effective at increasing the soil temperature than black plastic and increases in soil temperature resulted in reduced root <b>crown,</b> <b>stem,</b> and seed bank survival.

40|$|The {{wildfire}} {{season of}} 2000 will be recorded {{as one of}} the most widespread and damaging in recent history. As such, it will unquestionably have both short- and long-term effects on management activities in forested stands of the intermountain West. Some of those effects may be initiation of bark beetle or other insect outbreaks. In some cases, existing outbreaks may be prolonged. It will be important to determine to the extent possible which trees are likely to succumb to fire damage, which might survive fire effects but be killed by bark beetles, and which others may be more susceptible to fungal infection and degradation. The sooner those assessments can be made and preventive or corrective measures implemented, the more successfully adverse effects or economic loss will be avoided. Research conducted in the Northern Rocky Mountains within the past two decades can make prognoses of tree survival and appropriate management responses more effective. Ryan (1982, 1989) has shown that trees survive the effects of fire in relation to damage to <b>crown,</b> <b>stem,</b> or roots. Further, the amount of damage individual trees can sustain and still survive is dependent upon characteristics of its species (needle length and bark thickness), its size (diameter and height), and site factors on which it is growing.

The plants were grown individually in pots in a semi-protected environment and harvested at 74, 104, 134, 164, 194 and 224 days. Crioula populations varied in terms of height, leaf area, root volume, dry matter yield, and the Crioula-LI population outnumbered that of Crioula-SI. For height, length of internode and primary stem, Alfagraze (45. 1 cm, 2. 1 cm and 16. 7 cm) was similar to Crioula-SI (37. 6 cm, 2. 3 cm and 18. 2 cm); however, the leaf area (2. 028 cm²) and dry matter yield (20. 3 g) did not differ from those of Crioula-LI (2. 021 cm², 21 g). The Alfagraze cultivar surpassed the Crioula population in terms of procumbency, crown diameter and <b>crown</b> <b>stem</b> number. At the flowering stage, the Crioula-LI cultivar had total stem number (61 /plant) higher than Alfagraze (47 /plant) and Crioula-SI (41 /plant) cultivars.

40|$|In trees, {{water and}} sugars are transported by xylem and phloem {{conduits}} which are hydraulically linked. A simultaneous study of both flows is interesting, since they concurrently influence important {{processes such as}} stomatal regulation and growth. A few mathematical models have already been developed to investigate the influence of both hydraulically coupled flows. However, none of these models were so far tested using real measured field data. In the present study, a comprehensive whole tree model is developed that enables simulation of the stem diameter variations driven by both {{the water and the}} sugar transport. Stem diameter variations are calculated as volume changes of both the xylem and the phloem tissue. These volume changes are dependent on: (i) water transport according to the cohesion-tension theory, (ii) sugar transport according to the Münch hypothesis, (iii) loading and unloading of sugars and (iv) irreversible turgor-driven growth. The model considers three main compartments (<b>crown,</b> <b>stem</b> and roots) and is verified by comparison with actual measured stem diameter variations and xylem sap flow rates. These measurements were performed on a young oak (Quercus robur L.) tree in controlled conditions and on an adult beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) tree in a natural forest. A good agreement was found between simulated and measured data. Hence, the model seemed to be a realistic representation of the processes observed in reality. Furthermore, the model is able to simulate several physiological variables which are relatively difficult to measure: phloem turgor, phloem osmotic pressure and the Münch’s counter flow. Simulation of these variables revealed daily dynamics in their behaviour which were mainly induced by transpiration. Some of these dynamics are experimentally confirmed in literature, while others are not...|$|E
40|$|The {{colonization}} of winter oilseed rape plants and epidemiology of phoma stem canker differed between A/Tox(+) and B /Tox(0) Leptosphaeria maculans. In France and England, where plant colonization was investigated during {{two and three}} growing seasons, respectively, {{there was a difference}} in timing of leaf infection; A/Tox(+) L. maculans was predominant on leaves in the autumn (October/ November) but there was an increase in the incidence of B/Tox(0) in the winter (January/ February). In May, June and July both species could be isolated from all external parts of the plant (root to the upper stem) and all <b>crown</b> (<b>stem</b> base) tissues, although they differed in their distribution. At the root and crown, A/Tox(+) L. maculans was predominant and was located throughout the cortex, wood and pith tissues, but the rarer B/Tox(0) was located mainly in the cortex. Approximately equal numbers of A/Tox(+) and B/Tox(0) isolates were obtained from the upper stem - there was a greater proportion of B/Tox(0) isolates than at the crown. In England, after harvest in 1999 and 2000, pseudothecia on the lignified tap root and crown tissues produced predominantly A/Tox(+) ascospores (94 %), while pseudothecia higher up the stem produced more B/Tox(0) ascospores (60 %) than A/Tox(+) ascospores (40 %). The timing of the onset of leaf spotting, earlier in the season for A/Tox(+) than B/Tox(0) L. maculans, and the predominance of mycelium of A/Tox(+) at the crown are consistent with the assumption that A/Tox(+) is more likely to cause the most damaging stem cankers than B/Tox(0) L. maculans.

40|$|Fusarium {{head blight}} (FHB) is an {{important}} disease of wheat worldwide caused mainly by Fusarium graminearum (syn. Gibberella zeae). This fungus can be highly aggressive and can produce several mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol (DON), a well known harmful metabolite for humans, animals, and plants. The fungus can survive overwinter on wheat residues and on the soil, and can usually attack the wheat plant at their point of flowering, being able to infect the heads and to contaminate the kernels at the maturity. Contaminated kernels can be sometimes used as seeds for the cultivation of the following year. Poor knowledge {{on the ability of}} the strains of F. graminearum occurring on wheat seeds to be transmitted to the plant and to contribute to the final DON contamination of kernels is available. Therefore, this study had the goals of evaluating: (a) the capability of F. graminearum causing FHB of wheat to be transmitted from the seeds or soil to the kernels at maturity and the progress of the fungus within the plant at different growth stages; (b) the levels of DON contamination in both plant tissues and kernels. The study has been carried out for two years in a climatic chamber. The F. gramineraum strain selected for the inoculation was followed within the plant by using Vegetative Compatibility technique, and quantified by Real-Time PCR. Chemical analyses of DON were carried out by using immunoaffinity cleanup and HPLC/UV/DAD. The study showed that F. graminearum originated from seeds or soil can grow systemically in the plant tissues, with the exception of kernels and heads. There seems to be a barrier that inhibits the colonization of the heads by the fungus. High levels of DON and F. graminearum were found in <b>crowns,</b> <b>stems,</b> and straw, whereas low levels of DON and no detectable levels of F. graminearum were found in both heads and kernels. Finally, {{in all parts of the}} plant (heads, <b>crowns,</b> and <b>stems</b> at milk and vitreous ripening stages, and straw at vitreous ripening), also the accumulation of significant quantities of DON- 3 -glucoside (DON- 3 G), a product of DON glycosylation, was detected, with decreasing levels in straw, <b>crown,</b> <b>stems</b> and kernels. The presence of DON and DON- 3 G in heads and kernels without the occurrence of F. graminearum may be explained by their water solubility that could facilitate their translocation from stem to heads and kernels. The presence of DON- 3 G at levels 23 times higher than DON in the heads at milk stage without the occurrence of F. graminearum may indicate that an active glycosylation of DON also occurs in the head tissues. Finally, the high levels of DON accumulated in straws are worrisome since they represent additional sources of mycotoxin for livestock...|$|R

To assess {{the effects of a}} reduction in LiDAR pulse densities on model precision. Area of study : The study area is located in Galicia, NW Spain. The forests are representative of Eucalyptus globules stands in NW Spain, characterized by low-intensity silvicultural treatments and by the presence of tall shrub. Material and methods : Linear, multiplicative power and exponential models were used to establish empirical relationships between field measurements and LiDAR metrics. A random selection of LiDAR returns and a comparison of the prediction errors by LiDAR pulse density factor were performed to study a possible loss of fit in these models. Main results : Models showed similar goodness-of-fit statistics to those reported in the international literature. R 2 ranged from 0. 52 to 0. 75 for stand crown biomass, from 0. 64 to 0. 87 for stand stem biomass, and from 0. 63 to 0. 86 for stand aboveground biomass. The RMSE/MEAN · 100 of the set of fitted models ranged from 17. 4 % to 28. 4 %. Models precision was essentially maintained when 87. 5 % of the original point cloud was reduced, i. e. a reduction from 4 pulses m – 2 to 0. 5 pulses m – 2.

40|$|Graduation date: 1990 Ungerminated {{seed and}} recent germinants from 39 open-pollinated Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) {{families}} were planted {{in each of}} three competitive environments {{in order to determine}} the degree to which growth differences among families are influenced by competitive environment, seed weight, and date of emergence. The three competitive environments were a mixture of individuals from all families planted at a narrow spacing (4 x 4 cms), single (pure) family blocks planted at a narrow spacing (4 xL cms), and individuals from all families planted at a wide, non-competitive spacing (16 xl 6 cms). Despite some large changes in the relative ranking of families between competitive environments for total dry weight, the family x competitive environment interaction was non-significant (p<O. O 5). Furthermore, families did not differ significantly in competitive ability or density tolerance. Competitive environment, however, had a large effect on estimates of variance components, heritability, and genetic gain. Analysis of correlated response to selection indicated that testing and selection in mixture would result in the largest estimated gains in seedling dry weight, irrespective of the competitive environment anticipated for outplanting. Families differed significantly in seed weight, total percent emergence, and rate of emergence. Nevertheless, correlations between seed weight and rate of emergence, seed weight and seedling size, and rate of emergence and seedling size were not strong. The magnitude of the correlation between seed weight and seedling size of families was no less when germinants were used than when ungerminated seed was used. Thus, using germinants did not appear to be useful for controlling seed weight effects in this study. In addition the magnitude of the correlation between seed weight and seedling size was not influenced by interfamily competition. Genetic variation in seedling architecture (the form and structure of a seedling's <b>crown,</b> <b>stem,</b> and root system, as well as the proportion of total biomass partitioned to each) was assessed in order to explore the potential for realizing gains from ideotype breeding. Families differed significantly for all traits and estimates of heritability were mostly moderate (ranging from h 2 =O. 07 to 0. 49). Relative family performance for traits of seedling architecture was dependent upon the density at which families were grown for all traits except crown width relative to height, but intergenotypic competition did not affect relative family performance. Phenotypic relationships among traits of seedling architecture and seedling size were generally consistent across competitive environments, but genetic relationships did depend to some extent on competitive environment. These results using seedlings indicate that the potential exists to realize gains from ideotype breeding. However, relative family performance for seedling architecture traits may depend upon the density at which families are grown. Correlated responses to selection as determined by genetic correlations between traits may also depend upon competitive environment...|$|E
40|$|Pojava propadanja i odumiranja stabala hrasta lužnjaka jedan je od najznačajnijih gospodarskih i ekoloških problema u šumarstvu Hrvatske. Gospodarski problemi odnose se na smanjenje kakvoće drva, poremećaje u potrajnom gospodarenju te povećanje troškova gospodarenja i smanjenje prihoda. Ekološki problemi odnose se na stalne promjene stanišnih uvjeta i smanjenje stabilnosti šumskih ekosustava. Cilj istraživanja bio je analizirati iskorištenje drvnog obujma različito oštećenih stabala hrasta lužnjaka. Prosječna osutost stabala uz cestu Županja - Lipovac iznosila je 57 %, a na području spačvanskih šuma 24 %. Utvrđeno je intenzivno odumiranje sta bala hrasta lužnjaka uz cestu Županja-Lipovac u 2003. godini, koje je iznosilo 30 %. U svim stupnjevima osutosti utvrđena su stabla s biotskim oštećenjima. Kod stabala sa značajnom osutošću krošanja (> 25 %) utvrđeno je smanjenje udjela tehničkog drva za oko 10 %, odnosno isto toliko povećanje otpada.

Management with {{forests of}} pedunculate oak, the {{principal}} commercial tree species in Croatia, is burdened with increasing instances of tree decline and dieback. A combination of factors, such as decreased height and diameter increment, lower value of wood assortments, disturbances {{in planning and}} management and rising management costs, have made this the most important management and ecological problem in Croatian forestry. Tree decline is a gradual, continuous, or in some cases, rapid loss of tree vita lity. In forestry, tree decline is assessed {{on the basis of}} the exterior appearance of a tree, i. e. on the basis of tree damage assessment. Tree damage relates to <b>crown,</b> <b>stem</b> and root damage. Crown damage assessment is based on crown defoliation and changes in leaf colour. Tree dieback is sudden death of trees due to diseases or a complex action of adverse factors. It can often stem from a continuous decline of trees and a disturbed stability of forest ecosystems. In Croatia, the most severely affected tree species are the two principal ones: pe dunculate oak and silver fir. Tree decline and dieback incur high financial los ses, amounting to as much as 40 % of the potential market value of forest assortments. However, a decrease in non-market forest functions is much more serious. The economic consequences of tree decline are reflected on the quality and lower value of wood assortments. Dieback of pedunculate oak trees leads to sapwood degradation and a decrease in assortment diameter, which may amount to as much as 33 % of the diameter. The goal of research was to determine the impact of pedunculate oak da mage on the structure and volume of wood assortments. Research was con ducted on tree samples from four management units in Vinkovci ForestAdministration, along the Županja - Lipovac road. Wood volume utilization of dead and differently damaged trees of pedunculate oak was analyzed. Tree crowns along the Županja - Lipovac road were found to be more defo liated compared to those in the “Spačva basin” area. Crown defoliation of pe­dunculate oak was about 60 %, which indicates decreased tree vitality. Severely defoliated and dead trees manifested significantly higher biotic da mage in relation to slightly and moderately defoliated trees. The percentage share of veneer logs and class I logs, as well as stacked wood, was higher in trees with the first and second defoliation class. The share of lower class logs (II and III class), as well as the percentage share of waste was higher in trees with higher defoliation classes. Of the total wood volume, there were 20 % of veneer logs in defoliation classes 1 and 2 (slight and moderate defoliation), and 10 % of veneer logs in defoliation classes 3 and 4 (severe defoliation). Ac cording to the percentage share of assortments in the total technical roun dwood, there were 37 % of veneer logs in trees with defoliation classes 1 and 2, and 18 % of veneer logs in defoliation classes 3 and 4. The proportion of lower-class technical assortments was higher in higher classes of crown defo liation. The proportion of second class logs in defoliation classes 1 and 2 was 11 %, and in defoliation classes 3 and 4 it was 19 %. The proportion of third class logs in defoliation classes 1 and 2 was 15 %, while in defoliation classes 3 and 4 it reached 19 %. There was more waste in defoliation classes 3 and 4 (30 %), and slightly less in defoliation classes 1 and 2 (27 %). Tree damage lowers the quality of logs and lessens the income from pedun culate oak management. Tree damage assessment may reduce the amount of snags and increase management yields. Timely and appropriate tree damage assessments have a positive effect on overall management with pedunculate oak. The selection of damaged trees for felling is a key factor that ensures the quality of the wood matter in disturbed and unstable forest ecosystems...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} on the use of a semiempirical {{algorithm}} derived from a two layer radar backscatter model for forest canopies. The model stratifies the forest canopy into <b>crown</b> and <b>stem</b> layers, separates the structural and biometric attributes of the canopy. The structural parameters are estimated by training the model with polarimetric SAR (synthetic aperture radar) data acquired over homogeneous stands with known above ground biomass. Given the structural parameters, the semi-empirical algorithm has four remaining parameters, <b>crown</b> biomass, <b>stem</b> biomass, surface soil moisture, and surface rms height that can be estimated by at least four independent SAR measurements. The algorithm has been used to generate biomass maps over the entire images acquired by JPL AIRSAR and SIR-C SAR systems. The semi-empirical algorithms are then modified to be used by single frequency radar systems such as ERS- 1, JERS- 1, and Radarsat. The accuracy. of biomass estimation from single channel radars is compared with the case when the channels are used together in synergism or in a polarimetric system...|$|R

Perithecia referable to a Calonectria species were consistently detected on <b>crowns</b> and <b>stems</b> of symptomatic plants. Based on morphology, cultural features and molecular analysis, the species was identified as Calonectria ilicicola. Koch’s postulates were fulfilled by pathogenicity tests carried out on potted Laurus nobilis seedlings. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} report of the occurrence of a disease caused by Ca. ilicicola on Laurus nobilis...|$|R
50|$|Stem {{tetrapods}} are {{the animals}} {{belonging to the}} lineage leading to tetrapods from their divergence from the lungfish, our nearest relatives among the fishes. In addition {{to a series of}} lobe-finned fishes, they also include some of the early labyrinthodonts. Exactly what labyrinthodonts are in the stem group tetrapods rather than the corresponding crown group is uncertain, as the phylogeny of early tetrapods is not well understood. This example shows that <b>crown</b> and <b>stem</b> group definitions are of limited value when there is no consensus phylogeny.|$|R
40|$|To {{examine the}} {{hypothesis}} that both <b>stem</b> and <b>crown</b> mass affect the resistance of a tree to uprooting and that tree resistance increases {{with the increase in}} crown mass, we conducted tree-pulling experiments on three Picea glehnii plantations (stands A, B, and C: 27 - 32 years old) that differed in tree density and slenderness ratio. Allometries between <b>crown</b> and <b>stem</b> masses and between the critical uprooting moment and stem mass differed significantly among the three stands, with the crown mass and critical moment significantly larger in Stand C than in Stands A or B, despite the same stem mass. These results quantitatively verified our hypothesis. Allometries between <b>crown</b> and <b>stem</b> masses and between critical uprooting moment and stem mass were highly significant in each stand but were stand specific. Therefore, these allometries can be used to estimate tree resistance to uprooting in a given stand but not for data compiled from stands of various conditions and tree shapes. The allometry between critical moment and aboveground mass did not differ among the three Picea stands; thus, it is not stand specific and is generally appropriate to use for estimating tree resistance. To increase tree resistance to uprooting, we recommend light management for Picea glehnii plantations and probably other coniferous plantations as well...|$|R
40|$|Trees show {{considerable}} {{variation and}} flexibility in their size of <b>crowns,</b> height, <b>stem</b> diameters, <b>crown</b> height and <b>crown</b> length. <b>Stem</b> diameter at breast height {{is an important}} tree characteristics and an accurate prediction of tree growth dimensions. Relationships between <b>stem</b> diameter and <b>crown</b> length with other variables of Daniella oliveri was studied. The result reveal positive correlations between stem diameter, tree height, crown height and crown length which were all significant at F 0. 05 (1), 8. The corresponding F-values from analyses of variance were also significant (P= 0. 05) except for <b>stem</b> diameter with <b>crown</b> ratio, which show no relationship. The values of Pearson correlation coefficients (r) between the stem diameter, tree height, crown height and crown length were 0. 693, 0. 693 and 0. 733 respectively. The coefficients of determination (r 2) were 0. 480, 0. 617 and 0. 537 also respectively. Taking the crown length as a predictor variable, there were also positive correlations with tree height and crown height. Here the r-values were 0. 679 and 0. 698 respectively and the r 2 -values were 0. 461 and 0. 487 also respectively. These means that stronger correlations were found with tree height and crown height when the stem diameter was taken as predictor variable than crown length...|$|R
