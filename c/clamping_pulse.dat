Under such conditions the early outward current was just about maximal {{at the time of}} termination of the <b>clamping</b> <b>pulse.</b> An integration of the early current versus time record gave 1. 2 μcoulomb/cm 2 pulse, while a measurement of the extra Na 24 efflux resulting from repetitive pulsing gave a charge transfer of 1. 4 μcoulomb/cm 2 pulse. In sodium-containing sea water and with pulses 50 - 75 mv more positive than ENa the Na 24 efflux is about 3 times the measured charge transfer. The efflux of K 42 from a previously loaded axon into normal sea water is only 50 per cent of the measured charge transfer when the membrane is held for about 5 msec. at a potential such that there is no early current, and such pulses are at 10 - 20 /sec.

40|$|Membrane current {{following}} prolonged {{periods of}} rapid stimulation was examined in short (less than 1. 5 mm) canine cardiac Purkinje fibers of radius less than 0. 15 mm. The Purkinje fibers were repetitively stimulated by delivering trains of depolarizing voltage <b>clamp</b> <b>pulses</b> at rapid frequencies. The slowly decaying outward current following repetitive stimulation ("post-drive" current) is eliminated {{by the addition}} of 10 (- 5) M dihydro-ouabain. The post-drive current is attributed to enhanced Na/K exchange caused by Na loading during the overdrive. Depolarizing voltage <b>clamp</b> <b>pulses</b> initiated from negative (- 80 mV) or depolarized (- 50 mV) holding potentials can give rise to post- drive current because of activation of tetrodotoxin-sensitive or D 600 - sensitive channels.

The time constant of decay of the post-drive current depends on extracellular [K] in accordance with Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The Km is 1. 2 mM bulk [K], [K]B.

They have been studied in terms of rectangular pulse-width or pulse-height modulation. In order {{to take into account}} the complexity of the EMG signal within the bursts, we used a dynamic recurrent neural network (DRNN) for the identification of this pattern in subjects performing fast elbow flexion movements. Biceps and triceps EMGs were fed to all 35 fully-connected hidden units of the DRNN for mapping onto elbow angular acceleration signals. DRNN training was supervised, involving learning rule adaptations of synaptic weights and time constants of each unit. We demonstrated that the DRNN is able to perfectly reproduce the acceleration profile of the ballistic movements. Then we tested the physiological plausibility of all the networks that reached an error level below 0. 001 by selectively increasing the amplitude of each burst of the triphasic pattern and evaluating the effects on the simulated accelerating profile. Nineteen percent of these simulations reproduced the physiological action classically attributed to the 3 EMG bursts: AG 1 increase showed an increase of the first accelerating pulse, ANT an increase of the braking pulse and AG 2 an increase of the <b>clamping</b> <b>pulse.</b> These networks also recognized the physiological function of the time interval between AG 1 and ANT, reproducing the linear relationship between time interval and movement amplitude.

Voltage <b>clamp</b> <b>pulses</b> which induced calcium influx caused an absorbance decrease of the pH dyes indicating an internal acidification. The onset of the pH drop lagged the onset of Ca 2 + influx by 200 - 400 ms, and pH continued to decrease for several seconds after pulse termination which shut off Ca 2 + influx. Trains of action potentials also produced an internal pH decrease. Recovery of the pH change required periods greater than 10 min. The magnitude of the pH change was largely unaffected by external pH in the range 6. 8 - 8. 4. The voltage dependence of the internal p/ change {{was similar to the}} voltage dependence of calcium influx determined by arsenazo III, and removal of calcium from the bathing saline eliminated the pH signal. In neurons injected with EGTA (1 - 5 mM), the activity- induced internal Ca 2 + changes were reduced or eliminated, but the internal pH drop was increased severalfold in magnitude. After the injection of EGTA, voltage <b>clamp</b> <b>pulses</b> produced a decrease in arsenazo III absorbance instead of the normal increase. Under these conditions the dye was responding primarily to changes in internal pH. Injection of H+ caused a rise in internal free calcium.

40|$|We {{used the}} two-microelectrode voltage clamp {{technique}} and tetrodotoxin (TTX) {{to investigate the}} possible occurrence of slow inactivation of sodium channels in canine cardiac Purkinje fibers under physiologic conditions. The increase in net outward current during prolonged (5 - 20 s) step depolarizations (range - 70 to + 5 mV) following the application of TTX is time dependent, being maximal immediately following depolarization, and declining thereafter towards a steady value. To eliminate the possibility that this time-dependent current was due to inadequate voltage control of these multicellular preparations early during square <b>clamp</b> <b>pulses,</b> we also used slowly depolarizing voltage clamp ramps (range 5 - 100 mV/s) to ensure control of membrane potential. TTX-sensitive current also was observed with these voltage ramps; the time dependence of this current was demonstrated by {{the reduction of the}} peak current magnitude as the ramp speed was reduced. Reducing the holding potential within the voltage range of sodium channel inactivation also decreased the TTX-sensitive current observed with identical speed ramps. These results suggest that the TTX-sensitive time-dependent current is a direct measure of slow inactivation of canine cardiac sodium channels.

Excitation of the TnCDANZ within the muscle cell (325 nm) revealed a marked fluorescence at 510 nm and {{was similar to that}} observed in vitro, which was absent at 400 or 600 nm after subtraction of the fibre autofluorescence. High Ca 2 + salines increased the fluorescence at 510 nm by roughly 2 times.

Cells were held at- 80 mV and stimulated with 15 - 20 ms test depolarizations preceded and followed by voltage steps designed to isolate the slow calcium current. The slow calcium current had a threshold for activation of about 0 mV; the peak amplitude of the current reached a maximum at 30 to 40 mV and then declined for still stronger depolarizations. The calcium transient had a threshold of about- 10 mV, and its amplitude increased as a sigmoidal function of test potential and did not decrease again even for test depolarizations sufficiently strong (> 50 mV) that the amplitude of the slow calcium current became very small.

The temperature perturbation was accomplished by firing the laser beam obtained from a neodymium rod through the solution surrounding a single node. The temperature step was achieved within 1 msec using the laser in the normal mode of operation. During the voltage-clamped steady-state current a temperature jump from 4 °C increased the current to a new steady-state value within {{the time course of}} the T-jump. This finding suggests that the maximum potassium permeability PK has a rapid relaxation time and that the steady-state value of n (the value of potassium permeability divided by its maximum value) is relatively independent of temperature. T-jumps applied during the voltage-clamped sodium currents showed that the sodium permeability changed with a relaxation time that was also shorter than the duration of the normal mode laser output. T-jumps observed during a hyperpolarization or at the resting potential showed no detectable conductance change. When a T-jump immediately preceded a voltage <b>clamp</b> <b>pulse</b> the technique was then used to investigate the effect of changes in the steady-state temperature on the ionic conductances.

40|$|The {{influence}} of voltage-dependent conductances on the receptor potential of Limulus ventral photoreceptors was investigated. During prolonged, bright illumination, the receptor potential {{consists of an}} initial transient phase followed by a smaller plateau phase. Generally, a spike appears on the rising edge of the transient phase, and often a dip occurs between the transient and plateau. Block of the rapidly inactivating outward current, iA, by 4 -aminopyridine eliminates the dip under some conditions. Block of maintained outward current by internal tetraethylammonium increases {{the height of the}} plateau phase, but does not eliminate the dip. Block of the voltage-dependent Na+ and Ca 2 + current by external Ni 2 + eliminates the spike. The voltage-dependent Ca 2 + conductance also influences the sensitivity of the photoreceptor to light as indicated by the following evidence: depolarizing voltage- <b>clamp</b> <b>pulses</b> reduce sensitivity to light. This reduction is blocked by removal of external Ca 2 + or by block of inward Ca 2 + current with Ni 2 +. The reduction of sensitivity depends on the amplitude of the pulse, reaching a maximum at or approximately + 15 mV. The voltage dependence is consistent with the hypothesis that the desensitization results from passive Ca 2 + entry through a voltage-dependent conductance...|$|R

Several spontaneously active smooth muscles have interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) or ICC-like cells. We therefore examined cells from freshly dispersed uterine muscle strips (from pregnant human and rat myometrium) and in situ uterine preparations to determine the cell types present. Both preparations revealed numerous ICC-like cells; they were multipolar, with spider-like projections and enlarged central regions. These cells were readily distinguished from uterine myocytes by their morphology and ultrastructure, i. e., no myofilaments, numerous mitochondria, caveolae, and filaments. In addition, the ICC-like cells were noncontractile. These cells were negative to c-kit, a classic marker for ICCs. They stained positive for the intermediate filament, vimentin, a marker for cells of mesenchymal origin but not differentiated myocytes. The ICC-like cells had {{a more or less}} stable resting membrane potential of - 58 +/- 7 mV compared with smooth-muscle cells, - 65 +/- 13 mV, and produced outward current in response to voltage <b>clamp</b> <b>pulses.</b> However, in contrast with uterine myocytes, inward currents were not observed.

40|$|The inward-rectifying K+ current (IK 1) in cat {{ventricular}} myocytes, like inward-rectifying K+ {{currents in}} many other preparations, exhibited a negative slope conductance region at hyperpolarized membrane potentials that was time-dependent. This was evident as an inactivation of inward current elicited by hyperpolarizing voltage- <b>clamp</b> <b>pulses</b> resulting in a negative slope region of the steady-state current-voltage relationship at potentials negative to - 140 mV. Removing extracellular Na+ prevented {{the development of the}} negative slope in this voltage region, suggesting that Na+ can block IK 1 channels in a time- and voltage-dependent manner. The time and voltage dependence of Cs+-induced block of IK 1 was also examined. Cs+ blocked inward current {{in a manner similar to}} that of Na+, but the former was much more potent. The fraction of current blocked by Cs+ in the presence of Na+ was reduced in a time- and voltage-dependent manner, which suggested that these blocking ions compete for a common or at least similar site of action. In the absence of Na+, inactivation of IK 1 could also be induced by both Cs+ and Li+. However, Li+ was less potent than Na+ in this respect. Calculation of the voltage sensitivity of current block by each of these ions suggests that the mechanism of block by each is similar...|$|R
40|$|The voltage {{dependence}} of the intracellular Ca 2 + transients was measured in single rat ventricular myocytes with the fluorescent Ca 2 + indicator dye fura- 2. The whole-cell voltage clamp technique {{was used to measure}} the membrane current, and 0. 9 mM fura- 2 was loaded into the cell by including it in the dialyzing solution of the patch electrode. A mechanical light chopper operating at 1200 Hz was used to obtain simultaneous measurements of the intracellular Ca 2 + activity with fluorescence excitation {{on either side of the}} isosbestic point (330 nm and 410 nm). The symmetry of the two optical Ca 2 + signals was used as a criterion to guard against artifacts resulting, for instance, from motion. The voltage {{dependence of}} peak Ca 2 + current and the Ca 2 + transient measured 25 ms after depolarizing clamps from a holding potential of - 40 mV were bell-shaped and virtually identical. The Ca 2 + entry estimated from the integral of the Ca 2 + current (0 mV, 25 ms) corresponds to a 5 - 10 microM increase in the total intracellular Ca 2 + concentration, whereas the optical signal indicated a 100 microM increase in total intracellular Ca 2 +. Repolarization of <b>clamp</b> <b>pulses</b> from highly positive potentials were accompanied by a second Ca 2 + transient, the magnitude of which, when summed with that measured during depolarization, was nearly constant. Ryanodine (10 microM) had little or no effect on the peak Ca 2 + current but reduced the magnitude of the early Ca 2 + transients by 70 - 90 %. Epinephrine (1 microM) increased the Ca 2 + current and the Ca 2 + transients, accelerated the rate of decline of the Ca 2 + transients at potentials between - 30 and + 70 mV, and reduced the intracellular [Ca 2 +] below baseline at potentials positive to + 80 or negative to - 40 mV, where <b>clamp</b> <b>pulses</b> did not elicit any Ca 2 + release. Elevation of intracellular cAMP mimicked the relaxant effect of epinephrine at depolarizing potentials, whereas elevation of extracellular [Ca 2 +] did not. These results suggest that most of the activator Ca 2 + in rat ventricular cells is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum as a graded response to sarcolemmal Ca 2 + influx. Consistent with a graded Ca 2 +-induced Ca 2 + release we find that epinephrine increases the internal Ca 2 + release by increasing the Ca 2 + current. Epinephrine may also increase the Ca 2 + content of the sarcoplasmic reticulum that may, in turn, increase the Ca 2 +-induced Ca 2 + release. The relaxant effect of epinephrine appears to be caused by enhanced rate of Ca 2 + resequestration and is mediated by adenylate cyclase system...|$|R
40|$|The net outward {{current in}} {{bursting}} pace-maker neurones of the snail (Helix pomatia) during sustained and repeated voltage <b>clamp</b> <b>pulses</b> was studied. The properties of currents remaining in cobalt-Ringer or after TEA injection {{were compared with}} those in untreated cells. 2. With sustained voltage clamp depolarizations the net outward current first increases to a maximum at 150 msec and then declines to 60 % or less of its peak intensity. This depression, which is greater during repetition of short pulses (e. g. 100 msec pulses at 0 - 5 sec intervals), represents a true decrease in the outward flow of K (designated IK) and is not due to a decreased driving force resulting from extracellular K accumulation. The steady-state current-voltage (I-V) relationship for IK is N-shaped (Heyer & Lux, 1976). 3. A component of IK persists when Ca and Mg in the medium are replaced by Co (ICo-res). With voltage clamp depolarizations ICo-res increases rapidly to a maximum and then partially inactivates with voltage dependent time constants of hundredths or tenths of seconds. Repolarization removes the inactivation. Thus, repeated stimulation with short pulses does not increase the depression of ICo-res-ICo-res (e. g. measured during voltage steps from holding potentials of - 50 to near 0 mV) is smaller in test pulses preceded by depolarization and larger in pulses preceded by hyperpolarization. The steady state I-V relationship is not N-shaped. ICo-res is blocked by intracellular injection of tetraethylammonium (TEA). 4. Repeated voltage clamp depolarization to near 0 mV with 100 msec pulses for neurones with large Ca currents in normal Ringer produces a long-term depression which is maximal with 300 - 400 msec repolarizations (to - 50 mV) between pulses. This corresponds with stimulus parameters for the maximum Ca current (Heyer & Lux, 1976). Intracellular injection of Ca 2 + (also Ba 2 + and Co 2 +) likewise reduces the total net outward current and especially the delayed outward current under voltage clamp. 5. The component of IK which is removed by Co is identified as Ca dependent and designated IK(Ca). With single voltage <b>clamp</b> <b>pulses</b> IK(Ca) follows the approximate time course and voltage dependence of the slow inward Ca current (Iin slow; Heyer & Lux, 1976). Several lines of evidence suggest that Ca ions moving through the membrane activate IK(Ca). 6. Part of IK cannot be blocked by intracellular TEA injection. In different neurones {{the magnitude of the}} IK component resistant to TEA (ITEA-res) is approximately proportional to the relative magnitudes of Iin slow. ITEA-res does not inactivate with sustained depolarization and shows pronounced long-term depression with repetitive stimulation at intermediate intervals and an increased outward current {{at the onset of the}} second and subsequent pulses following short repolarizations. The steady-state I-V relationship is N-shaped. ITEA-res is abolished by extracellular Co. 7. A net inward current with low depolarizations can be measured after TEA injection [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Hormone {{release from}} nerve {{terminals}} in the neurohypophysis is a sensitive function of action potential frequency. We {{have investigated the}} cellular mechanisms responsible for this frequency-dependent facilitation by combining patch clamp and fluorimetric Ca 2 + measurements in single neurosecretory terminals in thin slices of the rat posterior pituitary. In these terminals both action potential-induced changes in the intracellular Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) and action potential duration were enhanced by high-frequency stimuli, all with a frequency dependence {{similar to that of}} hormone release. Furthermore, brief voltage <b>clamp</b> <b>pulses</b> inactivated a K+ current with a very similar frequency dependence. These results support a model for frequency-dependent facilitation in which the inactivation of a K+ current broadens action potentials, leading to an enhancement of [Ca 2 +]i signals. Further experiments tested for a causal relationship between action potential broadening and facilitation of [Ca 2 +]i changes. First, increasing the duration of depolarization, either by broadening action potentials with the K(+) -channel blocker tetraethylammonium or by applying longer depolarizing voltage clamp steps, increased [Ca 2 +]i changes. Second, eliminating frequency-dependent changes in duration, by voltage clamping the terminal with constant duration pulses, substantially reduced the frequency-dependent enhancement of [Ca 2 +]i changes. These results indicate that action potential broadening contributes to frequency-dependent facilitation of [Ca 2 +]i changes. However, the small residual frequency dependence of [Ca 2 +]i changes seen with constant duration stimulation suggests that a second process, distinct from action potential broadening, also contributes to facilitation. These two frequency-dependent mechanisms may also contribute to activity-dependent plasticity in synaptic terminals...|$|R

The delayed outward K+ current was measured in Ca 2 +-free ASW containing tetrodotoxin (TTX), using brief depolarizing <b>clamp</b> <b>pulses.</b> External TEA blocks the delayed K+ current reversibly in a dose-dependent manner. The experimental results are well fitted with a Michaelis-Menten expression, assuming a one-to-one reaction between TEA and a receptor site, with an apparent dissociation constant of 6. 0 mM. The block depends on membrane voltage and is reduced at positive membrane potentials. The Ca 2 +-activated K+ current was measured in Ca 2 +- free artificial seawater (ASW) containing TTX, using internal Ca 2 + ion injection to directly activate the K+ conductance. External TEA {{and a number of}} other quaternary ammonium ions block the Ca 2 +-activated K+ current reversibly in a dose-dependent manner. TEA is the most effective blocker, with an apparent dissociation constant, for a one-to- one reaction with a receptor site, of 0. 4 mM. The block decreases with depolarization. The Ca 2 +-activated K+ current was also measured after intracellular iontophoretic TEA injection. Internal TEA blocks the Ca 2 +- activated K+ current (but the block is only apparent at positive membrane potentials), is increased by depolarization, and is irreversible.

40|$|The {{homogeneity}} of voltage clamp control in small bundles of frog atrial tissue under double sucrose-gap voltage clamp conditions {{was assessed by}} intracellular microelectrode potential measurements from cells in the test node region. The microelectrode potential measurements demonstrated that (1) good voltage control of the impaled cell existed {{in the absence of}} the excitatory inward currents (e. g., during small depolarizing <b>clamp</b> <b>pulses</b> of 10 - 15 mV), (2) voltage control of the impaled cell was lost during either the fast or slow excitatory inward currents, and (3) voltage control of the impaled cell was regained following the inward excitatory currents. Under nonvoltage clamp conditions the transgap recorded action potential had a magnitude and waveform similar to the intracellular microelectrode recorded action potentials from cells in the test node. Transgap impedance measured with a sine-wave voltage of 1, 000 Hz was about 63 % of that measured either by a sine-wave voltage of 10 Hz or by an action potential method used to determine the longitudinal resistance through the sucrose-gap region. The action potential data in conjunction with the impedance data indicate that the extracellular resistance (Rs) through the sucrose gap is very large with respect to the longitudinal intracellular resistance (Ri); the frequency dependence of the transgap impedance suggests that at least part of the intracellular resistance is paralleled by a capacitance. The severe loss of spatial voltage control during the excitatory inward current raises serious doubts concerning the use of the double sucrose-gap technique to voltage clamp frog atrial muscle...|$|R
40|$|Background Neurotransmitters, neuropeptides and hormones are {{released}} from secretory vesicles of nerve terminals and neuroendocrine cells by calcium-activated exocytosis. A key {{step in this}} process is {{the formation of a}} fusion pore between the vesicle membrane and the plasma membrane. Exocytotic fusion leads to an increase in plasma membrane area that can be measured as a proportional increase in plasma membrane capacitance. Scope of review High resolution capacitance measurements in single cells, nerve terminals and small membrane patches have become possible with the development of the patch clamp technique. This review discusses the methods of whole cell patch clamp capacitance measurements and their use in conjunction with voltage <b>clamp</b> <b>pulse</b> stimulation and with stimulation by photorelease of caged calcium. It also discusses patch capacitance measurements for the study of single exocytotic events and fusion pore properties in neuroendocrine cells and nerve terminals. Major conclusions Capacitance measurements provide high resolution information on the extent and time course of fusion for the characterization of vesicle pools and the kinetics of exocytosis. They allow the characterization of the mode of fusion including distinction of single vesicle full fusion, transient kiss-and-run fusion or multivesicular compound exocytosis. Furthermore, measurement of fusion pore conductances and their dynamic behavior has enabled the characterization of fusion pore properties in a way that resembles the characterization of ion channel function through single channel recordings. General significance The combination of patch clamp capacitance measurements with pharmacological and molecular manipulations of exocytosis is emerging as a powerful approach to investigate the molecular mechanisms of calcium-activated exocytotic fusion pore formation.

40|$|Extensive studies {{performed}} in nonexcitable cells and expression systems {{have shown that}} type 1 transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC 1) channels operate mainly in plasma membranes and open through phospholipase C-dependent processes, membrane stretch, or depletion of Ca 2 + stores. In skeletal muscle, it is proposed that TRPC 1 channels are involved in plasmalemmal Ca 2 + influx and stimulated by store depletion or membrane stretch, but direct evidence for TRPC 1 sarcolemmal channel activity is not available. We investigated here the functional role of TRPC 1 using an overexpressing strategy in adult mouse muscle fibers. Immunostaining for endogenous TRPC 1 revealed a striated expression pattern that matched sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca 2 + pump immunolabeling. In cells expressing TRPC 1 -yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), {{the same pattern of}} expression was observed, compatible with a longitudinal SR localization. Resting electric properties, action potentials, and resting divalent cation influx were not altered in TRPC 1 -YFP-positive cells. Poisoning with the SR Ca 2 + pump blocker cyclopiazonic acid elicited a contracture of the fiber {{at the level of the}} overexpression site in presence and absence of external Ca 2 + which was not observed in control cells. Ca 2 + measurements indicated that resting Ca 2 + and the rate of Ca 2 + increase induced by cyclopiazonic acid were higher in the TRPC 1 -YFP-positive zone than in the TRPC 1 -YFP-negative zone and control cells. Ca 2 + transients evoked by 200 -ms voltage <b>clamp</b> <b>pulses</b> decayed slower in TRPC 1 -YFP-positive cells. In contrast to previous hypotheses, these data demonstrate that TRPC 1 operates as a SR Ca 2 + leak channel in skeletal muscle...|$|R
40|$|In heart, {{a robust}} {{regulatory}} mechanism {{is required to}} counteract the regenerative Ca 2 +-induced Ca 2 + release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Several mechanisms, including inactivation, adaptation, and stochastic closing of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) have been proposed, but no conclusive evidence has yet been provided. We probed the termination process of Ca 2 + release by using a technique of imaging local Ca 2 + release, or “Ca 2 + spikes”, at subcellular sites; and we tracked the kinetics of Ca 2 + release triggered by L-type Ca 2 + channels. At 0 mV, Ca 2 + release occurred and terminated within 40 ms after the onset of <b>clamp</b> <b>pulses</b> (0 mV). Increasing the open-duration and promoting the reopenings of Ca 2 + channels with the Ca 2 + channel agonist, FPL 64176, did not prolong or trigger secondary Ca 2 + spikes, even though two-thirds of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + remained available for release. Latency of Ca 2 + spikes coincided with the first openings {{but not with the}} reopenings of L-type Ca 2 + channels. After an initial maximal release, even a multi-fold increase in unitary Ca 2 + current induced by a hyperpolarization to − 120 mV failed to trigger additional release, indicating absolute refractoriness of RyRs. When the release was submaximal (e. g., at + 30 mV), tail currents did activate additional Ca 2 + spikes; confocal images revealed that they originated from RyRs unfired during depolarization. These results indicate that Ca 2 + release is terminated primarily by a highly localized, use-dependent inactivation of RyRs but not by the stochastic closing or adaptation of RyRs in intact ventricular myocytes...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} protein kinase C (PKC) were studied on {{dihydropyridine}} (DHP) -sensitive Ca channels from rabbit skeletal muscle T tubule membranes. To determine which channel subunits become phosphorylated under the conditions used for electrophysiological studies, we first performed biochemical studies of phosphorylation. T tubular membranes were fused with vesicles of the lipid mixture {{used in the}} planar bilayers, and phosphorylation was assessed using the same concentrations of PKC, adenosine 5 '-triphosphate, and buffers as {{were used in the}} electrophysiological experiments. The alpha 1 subunit of the DHP receptors was phosphorylated by PKC to an extent of 1 mol phosphate/mol protein. The beta subunit was also phosphorylated but to a significantly lesser extent. The DHP-sensitive Ca channel activity was studied after fusing T tubule membranes with planar bilayers (Ma, J., C. Mundiña-Weilenmann, M. M. Hosey, and E. Ríos. 1991. Biophys. J. 60 : 890 – 901). The bilayers were held at - 80 mV and activated by depolarizing voltage <b>clamp</b> <b>pulses.</b> The observed Ca channels exhibited two open states (tau o 1 = 5 ms and tau o 2 = 25 ms). On addition of purified PKC to the intracellular side, the proportion of the longer open state increased threefold. The average open probability during a 2 -s, maximally activating pulse (Pmax) increased from 10 to 15 %. The voltage dependence of activation was not changed by PKC; the Boltzmann parameters were V 1 = - 20. 5 mV and K = 10. 5 mV, which were not significantly different from the reference channels. The deactivation (closing) time constant was increased from 7 to 12 ms after PKC. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{models of}} the {{cerebrovascular}} smooth muscle cell have not addressed {{the interaction between the}} electrical, chemical and mechanical components of cell function during the development of active tension. These models are primarily electrical, biochemical or mechanical in their orientation, and do not permit a full exploration of how the smooth muscle responds to electrical or mechanical forcing. To address this issue, we have developed a new model that consists of two major components: electrochemical and chemomechanical subsystems of the cell. Included in the electrochemical model are {{models of the}} electrophysiological behavior of the cell membrane, fluid compartments, Ca 2 + release and uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and cytosolic Ca 2 + buffering, particularly by calmodulin. With this subsystem model, we can study the mechanics of the production of intracellular Ca 2 + transient in response to membrane voltage <b>clamp</b> <b>pulses.</b> The chemomechanical model includes models of: (a) the chemical kinetics of myosin phosphorylation, and the formation of phosphorylated myosin cross-bridges with actin, as well as, attached latch-type cross-bridges; and (b) a model of force generation and mechanical coupling to the contractile filaments and their attachments to protein structures and the skeletal framework of the cell. The two subsystem models are tested independently and compared with data. Likewise, the complete (combined) cell model responses to voltage pulse stimulation under isometric and isotonic conditions are calculated and compared with measured single cell length-force and force-velocity data obtained from literature. This integrated cell model provides biophysically-based explanations of electrical, chemical and mechanical phenomena in cerebrovascular smooth muscle, and has considerable utility as an adjunct to laboratory research and experimental design.
