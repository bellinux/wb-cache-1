Demonstrados laboratorialmente níveis séricos tóxicos de chumbo, foi submetido à quelação com EDTA e à retirada cirúrgica do projétil, com boa recuperação da polineuropatia, sem necessidade ulterior de corticosteróides.

40|$|Manganese (Mn) is an {{essential}} element for metabolic pathways {{but it can be}} toxic when present in excessive amounts in the body. Hypermanganesemia along with dystonia, polycythemia, characteristic MRI brain findings in the basal ganglia, and chronic liver disease are the hallmarks of an inherited Mn transporter defect due to mutations in the SLC 30 A 10 gene. We are reporting three siblings who presented with features of dystonia, polycythemia, MRI brain showing basal ganglia hyperintensity on T 1 weighted images and chronic liver disease. Blood Mn levels were markedly elevated in the affected patients. Mutation analysis of DNA samples of the affected children confirmed a homozygous missense mutation in SLC 30 A 10. Chelation therapy with intravenous <b>disodium</b> <b>calcium</b> <b>edetate</b> was started in two siblings and led to a marked decrease in whole blood Mn.

40|$|The {{project was}} aimed at {{evaluation}} of comparative therapeutic efficacy of two treatment regimes {{for the treatment of}} lead poisoning in sheep. For this purpose 20, two-months-old, lambs of Buchi breed were used as experimental animals. Five animals were kept as healthy control, whereas the remaining 15 animals were given oral aqueous solution of lead acetate daily. The dose was started from 5 mg/kg bodyweight and was increased gradually till it reached 100 mg/kg body weight by the end of 2 nd month when clinical toxicosis was observed. Clinical findings included diarrhea, hindquarter weakness and reduction of feed intake, accompanied by anemia and elevated blood lead levels up to 2. 72 ppm. The 15 toxicated animals were divided into three groups A, B and C comprising of 5 animals each. <b>Disodium</b> <b>calcium</b> <b>edetate,</b> which was used to treat animals of group A, resulted in 52. 7 % fall in blood lead level in 5 days. A combination of <b>disodium</b> <b>calcium</b> <b>edetate</b> and thiamine hydrochloride was used to treat animals of group B, which showed 73. 8 % fall in blood lead levels.

40|$|The {{appropriate}} clinical {{management of}} children who are moderately poisoned with lead (Pb) is under active investigation. To determine the pattern of change in blood Pb (BPb) levels in the absence of chelation therapy, we followed moderately Pb-poisoned children (initial blood Pb levels 1. 21 - 2. 66 mumol/l or 25 - 55 micrograms/dl) for 6 months with repeated BPb level measurements. Chelation therapy was not administered because all the children had negative lead mobilization tests indicating limited response to the chelating agent, <b>calcium</b> <b>disodium</b> <b>edetate</b> (CaNa 2 EDTA). Eligible children received the following interventions: notification of the health department to remediate lead hazards; reinforced educational efforts about the toxicity sources and treatment of Pb during 10 clinic and 3 home visits; and iron therapy for children with ferritin levels less than 16 micrograms/l. To quantify the lead paint hazards in the home, we combined a visual rating of the surfaces (intact to peeling) with an X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurement of the lead content of the painted surface. The sum of these assessments is termed the home environmental score (HES). Data were analyzed from 79 children. BPb levels declined by 27 %, on average, over 6 months. HES was correlated with BPb at enrollment, but neither the initial nor later HES measurements predicted BPb at other time points. The HES was highest at enrollment and declined by 50 % and 75 % at the second and third home visits, respectively. However, only a minority of the children (20 %) achieved an HES of 0, indicating no lead paint hazards at home. Despite some ongoing Pb exposure, a parallel fall in BPb levels was observed in subgroups of children with either initially low or high HES (above or below the median HES of 37). Iron status did not account for the change in BPb levels. These data provide evidence that our measure, the HES, is quantifiably related to BPb levels in children, that this correlation is significant only prior to intervention; and that BPb levels decline in children who are moderately poisoned with Pb after they are enrolled in a comprehensive intervention program, {{even in the absence of}} chelation therapy and in the presence of ongoing lead paint exposure and Fe deficiency...|$|E

40|$|Although {{manganese}} is {{an essential}} trace metal, {{little is known about}} its transport and homeostatic regulation. Here we have identified a cohort of patients with a novel autosomal recessive manganese transporter defect caused by mutations in SLC 39 A 14. Excessive accumulation of manganese in these patients results in rapidly progressive childhood-onset parkinsonism–dystonia with distinctive brain magnetic resonance imaging appearances and neurodegenerative features on post-mortem examination.

Stomach to caecum transit time was measured by environmental hydrogen analysis. Ileal infusion of a range of free fatty acids including petroselinic, oleic, myristoleic, erucic, linoleic, and linolenic all significantly slowed stomach to caecum transit time, as did the detergents (sodium bis (2 -ethyl hexyl) sulphosuccinate and sodium linoleyl sulphate), the triglyceride corn oil, and the phospholipid lecithin. Although the lipid soluble deconjugated bile acid deoxycholic acid slowed stomach to caecum transit time, the water soluble conjugated bile acid taurocholic acid accelerated it. Infusion of the lipid alcohol oleyl alcohol and the <b>calcium</b> chelating agent <b>disodium</b> <b>edetate</b> (EDTA) into the ileum did not delay the passage of the meal through the stomach and small intestine.

It is used in topical treatment of dry eyes and is now commercially available in oil based surfactant containing eye drops. Surfactants can irritate the eye surface causing burning, itching and irritation of the conjunctiva, and oil-based drops can result in blurred vision. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop surfactant free aqueous 0. 05 % (w/v) CyA eye drops where the drug is present in an aqueous vehicle containing CyA/cyclodextrin (CyA/CD) nanoparticles. The effects of the natural α-, β- and γ-cyclodextrins (αCD, βCD and γCD), as well as of the water soluble hydroxypropyl derivatives of γCD and αCD (HPγCD, HPαCD) and randomly methylated βCD (RMβCD), were determined in pure water. αCD had the best solubilizing effect increasing the solubility of CyA above 0. 05 % upon addition of only 5 % (w/v) αCD. γCD did not have as good solubilizing effect but was tested further due to its superior ability to form nanoparticles and its favorable toxicological profile.
