40|$|Structural {{airframe}} {{maintenance is}} {{a subset of}} aircraft maintenance, which is often performed at <b>scheduled</b> intervals <b>to</b> detect and repair cracks that would otherwise affect {{the safety of the}} aircraft. With the progress of structural health monitoring (SHM) techniques, which uses on-board sensors and actuators to assess damage status, condition-based maintenance (CBM) is considered as an alternative <b>to</b> traditional <b>scheduled</b> <b>maintenance.</b> By applying SHM techniques, CBM can access damages status as frequently as needed and unscheduled maintenance can be asked once the damage exceeds a particular threshold. Due to the harsh working environment and sensor limitation, the measurement data acquired from SHM is often quite noisy. In this paper, Extended Kalman filter is used to filer the noise to provide an accurate estimation of crack size and crack growth parameters together with their associated uncertainty. This knowledge is used to obtain a probabilistic estimate of the remaining useful service life of the structure. Based on these estimates, two maintenance philosophies are developed and further compared in terms of maintenance stop number or replaced panel number. The results indicate that both these two strategies reduce considerably the maintenance stop number compared <b>to</b> <b>scheduled</b> <b>maintenance...</b>|$|R

The analysis involves the derivation of the stationary distribution of the S-dimensional stochastic process corresponding to the time elapsed since the last S orders were placed. This distribution is then used to obtain an expression for the expected cost rate of operating the system in steady state as a function of S. A computer program has been developed to compute optimal S values and expected annual costs.

40|$|The {{traditional}} approach for <b>maintenance</b> <b>scheduling</b> concerns single-resource (machine) maintenance during production {{which may not}} be sufficient to improve production system reliability as a whole. Besides, in the literature many researchers <b>schedule</b> <b>maintenance</b> activities periodically with fixed maintenance duration. However, in a real manufacturing system maintenance activities can be executed earlier and the maintenance duration will become shorter since less time and effort are required. A practical example is that in a plastic production system, the proportion of machine-related downtime is even lower than mould-related downtime. The planned production operations are usually interrupted seriously because of the mismatch among the maintenance periods between injection machine and mould. In this connection, this paper proposes <b>to</b> jointly <b>schedule</b> production and <b>maintenance</b> tasks of multi-resources in order to improve production system reliability by reducing the mismatch among various processes.

40|$|Summary: Rising {{maintenance}} costs {{due to the}} complexity of naval vessel systems have empha¬sised the importance of cost-effective maintenance practises. The current preventative mainte¬nance approach <b>schedules</b> <b>maintenance</b> based on fixed-time intervals, leading to excess cost and time spent on maintenance. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} develop alternative maintenance practises. Challenges exist due to both the naval context and implementation of an alternative maintenance strategy. While reliability-based approaches are popular, they do not include a measure of severity of failure. This is necessary to produce a more-informed <b>maintenance</b> <b>schedule.</b> Risk-based <b>maintenance</b> (RBM) approaches use the product of severity and failure probability as an estimate of risk <b>to</b> <b>schedule</b> <b>maintenance.</b> Such an approach provides greater flexibility in maintenance intervals, allowing maintenance to be performed ‘on-condition’. RBM had existed since the 1970 s when it was developed for the nuclear power industry, though it had not been widely adopted for naval vessels to date. The present paper aims to describe the history of RBM for mobile maritime assets such as naval ships; by determining when RBM methodologies were developed. Eight RBM methodologies were identified, seven of which focused on components and one on a subsystem. Research focus on the development of RBM for mobile maritime assets had been found follow an increasing trend since the 1980 s. Future research directions are proposed for the development of RBM for naval vessels...|$|R

However, due to large forces {{as a result of}} hourly and seasonal variations in wind speed and direction, {{wind turbines}} experience stochastic loading that often lead to failures of wind turbine components such as the gearbox and generator.

The results indicated that there are five groups of shovels according to their repair duration.

Road roughness regions are required to be efficiently detected and located in order to ensure their maintenance. Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) systems provide a rapid and cost-effective alternative by providing accurate and dense point cloud data along route corridor. In this paper, an automated algorithm is presented for detecting road roughness from MLS data. The presented algorithm is based on interpolating smooth intensity raster surface from LiDAR point cloud data using point thinning process. The interpolated surface is further processed using morphological and multi-level Otsu thresholding operations to identify candidate road roughness regions. The candidate regions are finally filtered based on spatial density and standard deviation of elevation criteria to detect the roughness along the road surface. The test results of road roughness detection algorithm on two road sections are presented.
