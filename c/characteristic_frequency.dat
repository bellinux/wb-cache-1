Several of these oscillations have <b>characteristic</b> <b>frequency</b> ranges, spatial distributions and are associated with different states of brain functioning (e.g., waking and the various sleep stages). These oscillations represent synchronized activity over a network of neurons.

25|$|An {{external}} {{electromagnetic field}} at a frequency {{associated with a}} transition can affect the quantum mechanical state of the atom without being absorbed. As the electron in the atom makes a transition between two stationary states (neither of which shows a dipole field), it enters a transition state which does have a dipole field, and which acts like a small electric dipole, and this dipole oscillates at a <b>characteristic</b> <b>frequency.</b> In response to the external electric field at this frequency, the probability of the electron's entering this transition state is greatly increased. Thus, the rate of transitions between two stationary states is increased beyond that of spontaneous emission. A transition from the higher to a lower energy state produces an additional photon with the same phase and direction as the incident photon; this {{is the process of}} stimulated emission.|$|E

40|$|A new {{approach}} for frequency analysis of complex fractionated atrial electrograms Minh Phuong Nguyen, Christopher Schilling and Olaf Dössel Abstract — Atrial fibrillation (AFib) {{is the most}} common cardiac arrhythmia. Areas in atrial tissue with complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs) are among others responsible for the maintenance of AFib. Those areas are ideal target sites for ablation to eliminate AFib and restore sinus rhythm. As CFAEs are associated with high fibrillatory frequency, automated identification of CFAEs with spectral analysis helps developing objective strategies for AFib ablation. While the application of current techniques is restricted, this paper introduces a {{new approach}} to determine <b>characteristic</b> <b>frequencies</b> during AFib. By using Teager’s energy operator we calculate the signal envelope and study its spectrum after Fast Fourier Transformation. Harmonic analysis of distinctive peaks in the power spectrum is carried out to assess <b>characteristic</b> <b>frequencies</b> of a CFAE. While the currently available methods only find one dominant frequency in the spectrum of the signal, our method is capable to find multiple <b>characteristic</b> <b>frequencies,</b> if present.
