2500|$|The {{history of}} {{sertraline}} {{dates back to}} the early 1970s, when Pfizer chemist Reinhard Sarges invented a novel series of psychoactive compounds based on the structure of the neuroleptic <b>chlorprothixene.</b> Further work on these compounds led to lometraline and then to tametraline, a norepinephrine and weaker dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Development of tametraline was soon stopped because of undesired stimulant effects observed in animals. A few years later, in 1977, pharmacologist Kenneth Koe, after comparing the structural features of a variety of reuptake inhibitors, became interested in the tametraline series. He asked another Pfizer chemist, Willard Welch, to synthesize some previously unexplored tametraline derivatives. Welch generated a number of potent norepinephrine and triple reuptake inhibitors, but to the surprise of the scientists, one representative of the generally inactive cis-analogs was a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Welch then prepared stereoisomers of this compound, which were tested in vivo by animal behavioral scientist Albert Weissman. The most potent and selective (+)-isomer was taken into further development and eventually named sertraline. Weissman and Koe recalled that the group did not set up to produce an antidepressant of the SSRI type—in that sense their inquiry was not [...] "very goal driven", and the discovery of the sertraline molecule was serendipitous. According to Welch, they worked outside the mainstream at Pfizer, and even [...] "did not have a formal project team". The group had to overcome initial bureaucratic reluctance to pursue sertraline development, as Pfizer was considering licensing an antidepressant candidate from another company.|$|E
50|$|An {{intrinsic}} antidepressant {{effect of}} <b>chlorprothixene</b> has been discussed, but not proven yet. Likewise, it is unclear, if <b>chlorprothixene</b> has genuine (intrinsic) analgesic effects. However, <b>chlorprothixene</b> {{can be used}} as comedication in severe chronic pain. Also, like most antipsychotics, <b>chlorprothixene</b> has antiemetic effects.|$|E
50|$|If <b>chlorprothixene</b> {{is given}} {{concomitantly}} with opioids, the opioid dose should be reduced (by approx. 50%), because <b>chlorprothixene</b> amplifies the therapeutic actions and {{side effects of}} opioids considerably.|$|E

50|$|<b>Chlorprothixene</b> is {{structurally}} {{related to}} chlorpromazine, {{with which it}} shares, in principle, all side effects. Allergic side effects and liver damage seem to appear with an appreciable lower frequency. The elderly are particularly sensitive to anticholinergic side effects of <b>chlorprothixene</b> (precipitation of narrow angle glaucoma, severe obstipation, difficulties in urinating, confusional and delirant states). In patients >60 years the doses should be particularly low.|$|E
50|$|Dehydration of the {{tertiary}} (8) {{is accomplished}} by acylation of the tertiary hydroxyl group using acetyl chloride and the subsequent pyrolysis of the formed acetate, {{which leads to the}} desired <b>chlorprothixene.</b> In the second case, dehydration of the tertiary alcohol (9) {{is accomplished by}} chlorination of the tertiary alcohol group by thionyl chloride, forming the diene 2-chloro-9-(3-propen-1-iliden)thioxanthene (10), the addition to which of dimethylamine at high temperature forms the desired <b>chlorprothixene</b> (11).|$|E
50|$|<b>Chlorprothixene</b> may {{increase}} the plasma-level of concomitantly given lithium. In order to avoid lithium intoxication, lithium plasma levels should be monitored closely.|$|E
50|$|Consider {{additive}} sedative {{effects and}} confusional states to emerge, if <b>chlorprothixene</b> is given with benzodiazepines or barbiturates. Choose particular low doses of these drugs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chlorprothixene</b> (Cloxan, Taractan, Truxal) is {{a typical}} {{antipsychotic}} drug of the thioxanthene class {{and was the first}} of the series to be synthesized. It was introduced in 1959 by Lundbeck.|$|E
5000|$|Exert {{particular}} {{caution in}} combining <b>chlorprothixene</b> with other anticholinergic drugs (tricyclic antidepressants and antiparkinsonian agents): Particularly the elderly may develop delirium, high fever, severe obstipation, even ileus and glaucoma [...]|$|E
50|$|There {{is no good}} {{evidence}} that trifluoperazine is more effective for schizophrenia than lower-potency antipsychotics like chlorpromazine, <b>chlorprothixene,</b> thioridazine and levomepromazine, but trifluoperazine appears to cause more adverse effects than these drugs.|$|E
50|$|The initial {{doses of}} <b>chlorprothixene</b> {{should always be}} as low as {{possible}} (e.g. 30 mg at bedtime, 15 mg morning dose) and be increased gradually. Patients receiving 90 mg daily (and more) of the drug should be hospitalized, particularly during the initial phase of treatment. The theoretical maximum is 800 mg daily which can usually not be given due to side effects as stated above. Elderly and pediatric patients should be treated with particular low initial doses. Dose increments should be done slowly. If <b>chlorprothixene</b> is to be withdrawn, it should not be stopped abruptly, but the dose should be decreased steadily.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chlorprothixene</b> (2-chloro-9(1-dimethylamino)-3-propylidenthioxanthene) is made {{starting}} from 2-Chlorothioxanthone. 2-Chlorothioxantone, in turn, is prepared from 2-mercaptobenzoic acid (1), {{the reaction of}} which with 1-bromo-4-chlorobenzene (2) forms 2-(4-chlorophenylthio)benzoic acid 5, which upon reaction with phosphorus pentachloride transforms into acid chloride (6), and further undergoes intramolecular cyclization {{with the use of}} aluminum chloride to give 2-chlorthioxantone (6).|$|E
50|$|<b>Chlorprothixene</b> has {{a strong}} {{sedative}} activity with {{a high incidence of}} anticholinergic side effects. The types of side effects encountered (dry mouth, massive hypotension and tachycardia, hyperhidrosis, substantial weight gain etc.) normally do not allow a full effective dose for the remission of psychotic disorders to be given. So cotreatment with another, more potent, antipsychotic agent is needed.|$|E
50|$|After the war, Lundbeck {{continued}} to grow and in 1957 the company introduced Truxal (<b>chlorprothixene)</b> {{for the treatment of}} schizophrenia, entering the market for brain disorders. In 1954, the Lundbeck Foundation was established to maintain and expand the activities of Lundbeck Group and also to provide funding for scientific research of the highest quality. From the late 1970s and up through the 1980s, Lundbeck diverted its old agency business and thus became a dedicated pharmaceutical company focusing on the production of drugs used to treat disorders and diseases of the central nervous system. In 1989, Lundbeck launched the antidepressant Celexa (citalopram), which became the cornerstone for the company’s international expansion and in 2009 Lundbeck, bought Ovation and established a commercial platform in the USA.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{various other}} TCAs, {{trimipramine}} shows marked antagonism of presynaptic dopamine autoreceptors, potentially resulting in increased dopaminergic neurotransmission. This effect {{has also been}} observed with low-potency tricyclic antipsychotics like thioridazine and <b>chlorprothixene.</b> Notably, these two antipsychotics have been claimed many times to also possess antidepressant effects. As such, blockade of inhibitory dopamine autoreceptors and hence facilitation of dopaminergic signaling could {{be involved in the}} antidepressant effects of trimipramine. However, other authors have attributed the claimed antidepressant effects of antipsychotics like the two previously mentioned to α2-adrenergic receptor antagonism, although trimipramine specifically has only weak affinity for this receptor. Aside from antidepressant effects, low doses of antipsychotics have been found to increase REM sleep, and so dopamine autoreceptor antagonism could be involved in the unique effects of trimipramine in terms of REM sleep and sleep architecture.|$|E

40|$|The {{psychological}} {{effects of}} abrupt withdrawal of ataractic drugs {{have been studied}} by others.

In each of the chlorpromazine and thioridazine groups, three patients had gastrointestinal symptoms within 48 hours, lasting one to eight days. One patient on <b>chlorprothixene,</b> 450 mg. daily, experienced symptoms for six days. Perphenazine withdrawal produced no such symptoms. Thioridazine has little antiemetic action but perphenazine is prescribed for vomiting; hence it seems unlikely that the reported symptoms are due to a rebound action on the vomiting centre...|$|E
40|$|Aim. To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} pipofezine, tianeptine and <b>chlorprothixene</b> on blood pressure (BP) level and neuropsychological performance in patients with {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD) and arterial hypertension (HT). Material and methods. Young males with ADHD and HT (n= 58) were included into the study. Patients were split into three treatment groups: group 1 (n= 19) received pipofezine 50 mg/day, group 2 (n= 20) — tianeptine 25 mg/day, group 3 (n= 19) — <b>chlorprothixene</b> 50 mg/day. Clinicopsychopathologic and neurophysiological findings were evaluated at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment. BP self-monitoring, analysis of psychiatric disorders severity with Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, electroencephalography (EEG) were performed. Results. The positive dynamics of disregulatory-motor hyperactivity, subjective-cognitive and emotional-vegetative components of ADHD was observed. The positive dynamics of neurophysiological parameters (increase in EEG frequencies index) in groups 1 and 2 (from 0. 37 ± 0. 05 to 0. 54 ± 0. 07 and 0. 38 ± 0. 06 to 0. 50 ± 0. 05, respectively, p 0. 05).

40|$|The {{effect of}} some centrally-active {{and other drugs}} on the {{transmission}} of single nerve impulses through the isolated superior cervical ganglion preparation of the rabbit has been studied by recording both preganglionic and postganglionic action potentials. Block of conduction in the axon could be distinguished from block of the synaptic mechanism. The drugs {{did not appear to}} exert any one characteristic form of blocking action. A continuous spectrum of drug action linked an agent such as meprobamate which acted predominantly on the synapse to benactyzine which acted mainly by blocking axonal conduction. The drugs have been divided into three groups. Group I: hexamethonium, meprobamate, paraldehyde, amylobarbitone, methylpentynol and azacyclonal; these acted relatively selectively at the ganglion. Group II: N 714 C (the cis-isomer of <b>chlorprothixene),</b> prochlorperazine, methylpentynol carbamate, pipradrol, promethazine, perphenazine and procaine; the action of these drugs on the ganglion could be accounted for entirely in terms of their axonal depressant action. Group III: <b>chlorprothixene,</b> promazine, N 720 (dihydrochlorprothixene), chlorpromazine, hydroxyzine and benactyzine; these drugs also blocked axonal conduction but in addition they appeared to exert a “facilitating” action at the ganglionic synapse. The actions of adrenaline, adrenochrome, iproniazid, ergotoxine, mescaline and lysergic acid diethylamide on transmission were also studied. The implications of the modifications of ganglionic transmission produced by these drugs is discussed...|$|E

We applied luminol-dependent chemiluminescence to test the ability of these drugs to scavenge the biologically relevant oxygen-derived species: hydroxyl radical, superoxide radical, hypochlorous acid in vitro. We found that the phenothiazines were powerful scavengers of hydroxyl and superoxide radicals. <b>Chlorprothixene,</b> amitriptyline and imipramine had no scavenge activity to the superoxide radical. All drugs showed a moderate scavenger effect on hypochloric anion...|$|E
40|$|Seven structurally-related {{compounds}} {{consisting of}} three antidepressant drugs (imipramine, desmethylimipramine and amitriptyline), three tranquillizing agents (promazine, chlorpromazine and <b>chlorprothixene)</b> and a hybrid, desmethylpromazine, {{have been examined}} {{in a series of}} tests involving autonomic functions and antagonism of reserpine. Activities of the compounds in antagonizing reserpine-induced ptosis in rabbits and prolongation of alcohol hypnosis in mice give good correlation with their clinical actions, whilst their activities in augmenting excitation of rats by amphetamine and yohimbine toxicity in mice, and in reversing reserpine-induced bradycardia in rats offer further evidence for drug-induced sensitization to adrenergic or tryptaminic mechanisms, which is not however specific for antidepressant agents. No evidence has been obtained to indicate that a central parasympatholytic action is {{an important component of the}} antidepressant activity of imipramine and related drugs...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{widespread}} prevalence of resistant parasites, chloroquine (CQ) {{was removed from}} front-line antimalarial chemotherapy in the 1990 s despite its initial promise of disease eradication. Since then, resistance-conferring mutations {{have been identified in}} transporters such as the PfCRT, that allow for the efflux of CQ from its primary site of action, the parasite digestive vacuole. Chemosensitizing/ chemoreversing compounds interfere with the function of these transporters thereby sensitizing parasites to CQ once again. However, compounds identified thus far have disappointing in vivo efficacy and screening for alternative candidates is required to revive this strategy. In this study, we propose a simple and direct means to rapidly screen for such compounds using a fluorescent-tagged CQ molecule. When this screen was applied to a small library, seven novel chemosensitizers (octoclothepin, methiothepin, metergoline, loperamide, <b>chlorprothixene,</b> L- 703, 606 and mibefradil) were quickly elucidated, including two which showed greater potency than the classical chemosensitizers verapamil and desipramine...|$|E
40|$|Reviewed on a layman's {{level was}} {{research}} on psychopharmacology with the emotionally and behaviorally disturbed. General conclusions {{drawn from the}} man y studies were {{that the effect of}} drugs on intellectual functioning had not been determined and that there was little evidence to indicate that the learning process was consistently and reliably affected in certain predictable ways. It was advised that the psychologist be informed when a subject was receiving drug medication, the drug name, and dosage. The review concerned stimulants, tranquilizers, and sedatives frequently used by pediatricians. Stimulants referred to in research included dextroamphetamine, D-amphetamine, methylphenidate, rnonoaminoxidase inhibitors, amitriptyline, proamitriptyline, and cholinergics; methylphenidate was the drug used most often. Tranquilizers cited were thioridazine, chlorpromazine, reserpine, phenothiazines, diphenylmethanes, fluphenazine hydrochloride, <b>chlorprothixene</b> hydrochloride, primazine hydrochloride, and thiorpropazate; drugs were found to be an advisable treatment for behaviorally disordered children.

40|$|Reprofiling of {{existing}} drugs to treat conditions not originally targeted {{is an attractive}} means of addressing the problem of a decreasing stream of approved drugs. To determine if 3 D shape similarity {{can be used to}} rationalize an otherwise serendipitous process, we employed 3 D shape-based virtual screening to reprofile existing FDA-approved drugs. The study was conducted in two phases. First, multiple histamine H(1) receptor antagonists were identified to be used as query molecules, and these were compared to a database of approved drugs. Second, the hits were ranked according to 3 D similarity and the top drugs evaluated in a cell-based assay. The virtual screening methodology proved highly successful, as 13 of 23 top drugs tested selectively inhibited histamine-induced calcium release with the best being <b>chlorprothixene</b> (IC(50) 1 nM). Finally, we confirmed that the drugs identified using the cell-based assay were all acting at the receptor level by conducting a radioligand-binding assay using rat membrane...|$|E
40|$|The need to {{discover}} and develop new antimalarial therapeutics is overwhelming. The annual mortality attributed to malaria, currently approximately 2. 5 million, is increasing due primarily to widespread resistance to currently used drugs. One strategy to identify new treatment alternatives for malaria is to examine libraries of diverse compounds for the possible identification of novel scaffolds. Beginning with libraries of drug or drug-like compounds is an ideal starting point because, {{in the case of}} approved drugs, substantial pharmacokinetic and toxicologic data should be available for each compound series. We have employed a highthroughput screen of the MicroSource Spectrum and Killer Collections, a library of known drugs, bioactive compounds, and natural products. Our screening assay identifies compounds that inhibit growth of Plasmodium falciparum cultured in human erythrocytes. We have identified 36 novel inhibitors of P. falciparum, of which 19 are therapeutics, and five of these drugs exhibit effective 50 % inhibitory concentrations within similar ranges to therapeutic serum concentrations for their recently indicated uses: propafenone, thioridazine, <b>chlorprothixene,</b> perhexiline, and azlocillin. The findings we report here indicate that this is an effective strategy to identify novel scaffolds and therefore aid in antimalarial drug discovery efforts.

40|$|Antipsychotics are the {{commonly}} prescribed {{drugs in the}} treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, which is {{the most common form of}} dementia. Atypical antipsychotics are an effective short-term (6 - 12 weeks) treatment in relieving the depression, psychotic symptoms (hallucinations and delusions) and behavioral disturbances (physical and verbal aggression, motor hyperactivity, repetitive mannerisms and activities, and combativeness). But several placebo studies & clinical based evidences which recorded the deaths of the patients concluded that this medication nearly doubles the risk of death in patients over two to three years by developing cerebrovascular adverse events, upper respiratory infections, oedema or extra pyramidal symptoms. The use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI’s), Nor- epinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NERI’s) and Tricyclic antidepressants (TCA’S) may relieve depression but still they are associated with serious adverse effects such as insomnia, agitation, confusion and GI adverse effects. So there is a need for applying non-pharmacological treatment i. e. Psychotherapy rather than the Pharmacotherapy in minimizing the symptoms & anticipates further research in developing the appropriate medication, alternative to the antipsychotics which minimizes the suffering of the patient. Typical antipsychotics were the first generation of the drugs aimed to treat psychosis by antagonizing D 2 receptors. As a result, they reduce dopaminergic neurotransmission in the four dopamine pathways. Typical Antipsychotics include Chlorpromazine, <b>Chlorprothixene,</b> and Haloperidol etc. Atypical Antipsychotics are the drugs which not only block dopamine receptors but also serotoni...|$|E
40|$|To image mouse {{cortical}} retinotopy maps, {{we followed}} the method developed by Kalatsky and Stryker (2003). Adult mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of urethane (1. 0 g/kg in 10 % saline solution) supplemented by <b>chlorprothixene</b> (0. 2 mg/mouse i. m.). In addition, lidocaine (2 % xylocaine jelly) was applied locally to all incisions. Atropine (5 mg/kg mouse) and dexamethasone (0. 2 mg/mouse) were injected subcutaneously. The animals were placed in a stereotaxic apparatus, their temperature was maintained at 37. 5 °C, and electrocardiograph leads were attached to monitor the heart rate continuously throughout the experiment. A tracheotomy was performed in some experiments. A craniotomy was made over the visual area of the left hemisphere; the dura mater was left intact. Low-melting point agarose (3 % in saline) and a glass coverslip were placed over the exposed area. All experimental procedures were approved by the UCSF Committee on Animal Research.
