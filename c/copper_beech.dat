5|$|NY132 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with the concurrency of US202 and NY35 {{in front of}} Franklin D. Roosevelt State Park {{in the town of}} Yorktown. NY132 proceeds north along Old Yorktown Road, crossing through a residential section of Yorktown. After passing a junction with Meadowcrest Drive, the route takes a turn to the northwest then returns to its northerly progression near Strang Boulevard. Remaining a two-lane residential street through Yorktown, NY132 passes Lakeland <b>Copper</b> <b>Beech</b> Middle School and turns northwest once again towards more homes and into a partial diamond interchange with the Taconic State Parkway. At this interchange, there is no access from NY132 to the northbound Taconic, and no access from the southbound Taconic to NY132.|$|E
25|$|The estate {{woodlands}} contains typical species, such as <b>copper</b> <b>beech,</b> horse-chestnut, yew, bay-laurel, oaks, ornamental pines, {{and a fine}} walnut. Several {{very large}} beeches and sycamores are also present. The Glenfield Ramblers recorded two especially rare species {{in the area of}} the Lainshaw Estate, the lesser wintergreen and the bird's nest orchid. Unfortunately no precise details of the site were recorded.|$|E

Built in 1966 as a rectangular structure, the library's convex wall of glass facing the campus' park blocks was added in 1989 to surround and preserve a large <b>copper</b> <b>beech</b> tree that was planted in 1890.|$|E

2500|$|As {{in other}} parts of New York City, centuries of tumultuous change have not totally obliterated old landmarks. [...] Within Woodside, the {{double-decker}} station of the Long Island Rail Road (built in 1869) and the IRT Flushing Line (built in 1917) both remain, and were renovated in 1999. A trolley barn at Northern Boulevard and 51st Street has been preserved as the Tower Square Shopping Center. [...] The New York and Queens Railroad Company built the barn in 1896. A transportation hub like the LIRR/IRT stations, it was the largest car barn in Queens. Woodside also possesses an ancient tree, not the great chestnut (which was gone {{by the end of the}} 19th century) but a large <b>copper</b> <b>beech</b> of somewhere between 150 and 300 years' age. [...] Documents in the archive of the Queens Historical Society suggest that it might have been planted during the time of the Revolutionary War. Among the oldest of Woodside's historic landmarks are its cemeteries. Calvary Cemetery was founded in 1845 by trustees of Manhattan's St. Patrick's Cathedral for Roman Catholic burials and was later expanded by the addition of three sections comprising New Calvary. Calvary and New Calvary's combined [...] contain over three million burials. Located on 54th Street between 31st & 32nd Avenues, the Moore-Jackson Cemetery is much older and smaller than Calvary. [...] Established in 1733, it is one of the oldest cemeteries in New York. Only fifteen graves remain visible, the earliest dated 1769.|$|E

6000|$|... "Their {{reasons for}} their conduct. But you shall have it all just as it occurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and drove me in his dog-cart to the <b>Copper</b> <b>Beeches.</b> It is, as he said, {{beautiful}}ly situated, {{but it is not}} beautiful in itself, for it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are grounds round it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the Southampton highroad, which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door. This ground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part of Lord Southerton's preserves. A clump of <b>copper</b> <b>beeches</b> immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place.|$|R

60|$|There {{were several}} other guests in the house, {{and the party}} {{spent most of the}} hot {{afternoon}} about the tennis net and lounging under the shadow of a big <b>copper</b> <b>beech</b> on the lawn.

60|$|We were {{as good as}} our word, for it {{was just}} seven {{when we reached the}} <b>Copper</b> <b>Beeches,</b> having put up our trap at a wayside public-house.

60|$|She {{sat down}} smiling, and Miss Clavier {{regarded}} {{her out of}} half‐closed eyes. There was nobody very near them, and only two dim colored lights above their heads. Somebody was singing, and a sweet tenor voice floated away into {{the stillness of the}} moonlit night. Miss Clavier glanced swiftly round into the shadows of the <b>copper</b> <b>beech</b> that fell blackly athwart the seat.|$|E
60|$|Holmescroft was a large, two-storied, low, creeper-covered residence. A {{verandah}} at {{the south}} side gave on to a garden and two tennis courts, separated by a tasteful iron fence from a most park-like meadow {{of five or six}} acres, where two Jersey cows grazed. Tea was ready {{in the shade of a}} promising <b>copper</b> <b>beech,</b> and I could see groups on the lawn of young men and maidens appropriately clothed, playing lawn tennis in the sunshine.|$|E
60|$|Leslie was {{sprawled on}} a camp-chair, under a <b>copper</b> <b>beech</b> on the lawn, his cigar glowing. He watched the ash grow strange and grey {{in the warm}} daylight, and he felt sorry for poor Nell Wycherley, whom he had driven that morning to the station, for would she not be frightfully cut up as the train whirled her further and further away? These girls are so daft with a fellow! But she was a nice little thing—he'd get Marie to write to her.|$|E

60|$|She {{took him}} across the lawn to a bench beneath a <b>copper</b> <b>beech,</b> and Festing braced himself when a girl got up. She wore white and {{the shadow of the}} leaves {{checkered}} the plain dress. He noted the unconscious grace of her pose as she turned towards him, and her warm color, which seemed to indicate a sanguine temperament. Helen Dalton was all that he had thought, and something more. He knew her level, penetrating glance, but she had a virility he had not expected. The girl was somehow stronger than he portrait.|$|E
60|$|A <b>copper</b> <b>beech</b> threw a cool shadow {{across the}} small table and basket chairs; the china and silver were old and good. Beyond the belt of {{wavering}} shade, the recently mown grass gave out a moist smell {{in the hot}} sun. The grass grew fine and close, for the turf was old, but there were patches of ugly weeds. The borders by the house were thinly planted and the color plan was rude, but one could not do much with a rheumatic gardener and a boy. There used to be two men, but Mrs. Osborn had insisted on cutting wages down.|$|E
60|$|The churchyard {{was full}} of fine trees. On one side a {{magnificent}} cedar; on the other a great <b>copper</b> <b>beech.</b> Here and there among the tombs and headstones many beautiful blossoming trees rose from the long green grass. The laburnum glowed in the June afternoon sunlight; the lilac, the hawthorn and the clustering meadowsweet which fringed {{the edge of the}} lazy stream mingled their heavy sweetness in sleepy fragrance. The yellow-grey crumbling walls were green in places with wrinkled harts-tongues, and were topped with sweet-williams and spreading house- leek and stone-crop and wild-flowers whose delicious sweetness made for the drowsy repose of perfect summer.|$|E
50|$|The {{calabash}} pipe {{is associated}} with Sherlock Holmes because early portrayers, particularly William Gillette and Basil Rathbone, made an artistic decision to use something large and easily recognized as a pipe. A calabash pipe has a large air chamber beneath the bowl that provides a cooling and mellowing effect. Holmes preferred harsh and strong tobaccos and therefore would eschew such a pipe. In fact, most stories, particularly The Adventure of the <b>Copper</b> <b>Beeches,</b> described him as preferring a long-stemmed cherry-wood or a clay pipe.|$|R
50|$|Crescent {{now sits}} on 40 acres of mature grounds and gardens {{landscaped}} by Fr William Troddyn {{and the late}} school gardener, P.J. Brennan. Fr Troddyn was introduced to professional gardening whilst a scholastic at Emo Park, {{and some of his}} efforts are still visible there. Amongst the many trees he planted at Crescent is a mature avenue of <b>copper</b> <b>beeches,</b> and thousands of daffodils that spring forth annually in May. The school also maintains a nature garden to attract wildlife to the campus and make students environmentally aware.|$|R
60|$|And a bar {{between her}} and her aunt seemed to have vanished, as they drove up the now {{familiar}} slope, and under the leafless <b>copper</b> <b>beeches.</b> Blood is thinker than water, and what five months ago had seemed to be exile, had become the first step towards home, if not home itself, for now, like Valetta, she welcomed the sound of her mother's voice in her aunt's. And there were Valetta and Fergus rushing out, almost under the wheels to fly at her, and Aunt Ada's soft embraces in the hall.|$|R
