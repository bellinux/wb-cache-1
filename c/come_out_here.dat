[...] Ray stated [...] "It took a long while to get Jim out here, but finally we managed it." ...|$|E
500|$|The team hosted {{an event}} to honor wounded {{veterans}} of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom at Heinz Field. Players signed autographs and held on-field drills with the veterans, while soldiers and Marines spoke of their experiences. Chris Hoke, {{who attended the}} event said, [...] "These {{are the people who}} fight for us to have our freedom and be who we are as Americans. To <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> and spend a couple hours with them and hear their stories is unbelievable. There's nothing better than this." ...|$|E
500|$|Kent Hughes {{took to the}} Chairman {{role with}} gusto, {{although}} his relationship with Brundage was never cordial. During a visit to Melbourne in 1955 to inspect the preparations, Brundage was less than impressed with the progress achieved under Kent Hughes's chairmanship and condemned Kent Hughes's apparent lack of concern at the looming deadline for the Games. Not one to take criticism lightly, Kent Hughes {{was quoted as saying}} that he had enough to worry about without having [...] "Chicago blow-ins <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> and blow their tops over nothing in particular and annoy everyone in general." ...|$|E

60|$|CAPT. G. I <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> and {{the whole}} thing went phut. She wrote to say {{that there had been a}} mistake, and then she married.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not. I <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> {{to escape}} college--and my father's business." [...] He laughed. [...] "But don't betray me. I'm {{supposed}} to be 'slowly improving.'" ...|$|R
500|$|Gunslinger began {{production}} in February 1956, as the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees {{and the film}} studios renegotiated for a five-day work week instead of six. Director Roger Corman decided to film a low-budget Western in six days before the new contract took effect, with Gene Corman providing half of the financing. Shot at the Jack Ingram Western Movie Ranch in Topanga, California, it rained for five days during the shoot. Corman had to go over schedule, taking seven days instead of six, which he recounted as {{the only time he}} had ever done so. The rain made the area muddy, causing trucks, cameras, and lighting equipment to sink. When the crew left the set, Corman did not hire a guard, telling the film's assistant director that [...] "anyone who'd <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> steal the equipment, and carry it through this mud is welcome to get it." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} couple of months, they were merely [...] "killing time", {{according}} to Robertson, with many early sessions devoted to covers. [...] "With the covers Bob was educating us a little", recalls Robertson. [...] "The whole folkie thing was still very questionable to us—it wasn't the train we came in on. ... He'd come up with something like 'Royal Canal', and you'd say, 'This is so beautiful! The expression!' ... He remembered too much, remembered too many songs too well. He'd come over to Big Pink, or wherever we were, and pull out some old song—and he'd prepped for this. He'd practiced this, and then <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> to show us." [...] Songs recorded at the early sessions included material written or made popular by Johnny Cash, Ian & Sylvia, John Lee Hooker, Hank Williams and Eric Von Schmidt, as well as traditional songs and standards. Linking all the recordings, both new material and old, {{is the way in which}} Dylan re-engaged with traditional American music. Biographer Barney Hoskyns observed that both the seclusion of Woodstock and the discipline and sense of tradition in The Hawks' musicianship were just what Dylan needed after the [...] "globe-trotting psychosis" [...] of the 1965–66 tour. Continued recording at the Big Pink was impossible because of the fanbase that had built up around Dylan. He even reported finding a couple in his bed once.|$|E

60|$|May 16: Istra <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here.</b> Seems very discontented. I'm afraid she's {{the kind}} to want novelty and {{attention}} incessantly, {{she seems to}} forget that I'm pretty busy.|$|R
2500|$|We're {{being taken}} {{for the biggest}} ride I can {{remember}} – the umpiring, the crowd and Charlie. I promise I won't say anything to anybody, but it is downright cheating...this isn't England vs the West Indies...Some of the remarks from the crowd are too awful, shouting [...] "kill" [...] at us. I must be bloody mad to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Popcorn Pictures {{gave the}} film {{two and a}} half stars out of four, writing: [...] "Screamers isn't terrible. The scenes inside the {{refinery}} are creepy enough with them stalking and being stalked by the Screamers. But the intro and finale are terrible ways to start and end a film respectively. There was a good film waiting to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> it's a shame only half of it did." ...|$|E
2500|$|Navetta died October 31, 2008 after {{becoming}} ill {{over the course}} of a few days. [...] "What I was told by his family", said Stevenson, [...] "was that he died from a diabetic coma and he never came to, he just died in his sleep. But suffice it to say that Frank was in very poor health. Maybe the last ten years of his life, I saw a real decline there [...] Of course, we rekindled our friendship years later in a way that was very ultimate and very real, and it didn’t involve the band because he wasn’t in the band. He would <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> every year and stay for about a month with me, every year. He did it for years, until he died." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, I can't say how far I'll go. I'm undecided. Just <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> for {{a little}} fresh air, you know, with no {{definite}} plans," [...] explained the stranger.|$|R
2500|$|It's not ill-conceived to look {{at certain}} people and {{question}} when they <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> what they bring with them ... We have strict quarantine laws {{and it should be}} the same when it comes to cultures that do not want to integrate. We should be very careful about where certain Muslims come from and what they believe. If you come here, you should behave yourself – it's as simple as that... If people come and live in any country and their way of life is so different they need their own special laws, then possibly they have to pick somewhere else to live. The idea of any Muslim being photographed for a passport or a licence with one of those shrouds on – sorry, it just can't happen.|$|E
2500|$|As of , {{at least}} four demonstrations have been held {{around the country in}} {{response}} to DuBose's death. A Black Lives Matter vigil and rally in support of DuBose was held in Cincinnati on , the third such event since the shooting. The victim's mother said, [...] "As long as we stand up for the righteous, we going to be OK. I would <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> every night, I will go city to city because now I'm involved, my child was involved." [...] Participants chanted [...] "I am Sam DuBose." [...] Around 300 participants subsequently walked through Over-the-Rhine to Fountain Square. Six people were arrested on charges of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest during the march. One hundred protesters joined a [...] "United March for Justice" [...] on , linking DuBose's killing with the deaths of Tamir Rice, John Crawford, and Samantha Ramsey.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "that {{brings us}} to the {{question}} why you <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here.</b> Was it because you had heard {{that it was a good}} country for hunting and fishing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps you're right," [...] said Maxton; [...] "I {{confess that}} I have troubled myself {{very little about}} {{religion}} since I <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> but my conscience has often reproached me for it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Viterelli told Larry King {{that before}} he acted, [...] "I {{had a couple}} of beer joints that I sold in New York and I <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> (in California) and I was looking around." ...|$|R
