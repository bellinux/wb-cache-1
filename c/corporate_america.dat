5|$|Krusty is {{inspired}} {{to return to}} doing low-key events, where he structures a new image for himself as a stand-up comedian who tells the truth, criticizes commercialism, and refuses to sell out to <b>corporate</b> <b>America.</b> He also changes his appearance, sporting a dark sweater and tying his hair in a ponytail. Observing his newfound popularity, two marketing executives try to persuade Krusty to endorse a new sport utility vehicle called the Canyonero. Although he tries to resist, he eventually succumbs to the lure of money. After promoting the Canyonero at a comedy performance in Moe's Tavern, he is booed off stage by the patrons. He finally admits to himself that comedy is not in his blood and selling out is. The episode ends with an extended advertisement for the Canyonero, as Krusty and Bart leave Moe's tavern in Krusty's new SUV.|$|E
25|$|Although {{originally}} {{conceived as}} a one-dimensional, recurring villain who might occasionally enter the Simpsons' lives and wreak some sort of havoc, Mr. Burns' popularity has led to his repeated inclusion in episodes. He is a stereotype of <b>corporate</b> <b>America</b> in his unquenchable desire to increase his own wealth and power, inability to remember his employees' names (including Homer's, despite frequent interactions– {{which has become a}} recurrent joke) and lack of concern for their safety and well-being. Reflecting his advanced age, Mr. Burns is given to expressing dated humor, making references to Jazz Age popular culture, and aspiring to apply obsolete technology to everyday life. Conan O'Brien has called Mr. Burns his favorite character to write for, due to his arbitrarily old age and extreme wealth.|$|E
25|$|Professor Katarina Sjöberg {{argues in}} The Wall Street Culture {{that within the}} media {{negative}} images of Wall Street are painted {{in terms of the}} district's market falls, money losses and deceitful gains. However, this is not what Wall Street investors are bothered by. Instead, it is the public's words and opinions which they feel mold their image. Sjöberg notes that in the American culture, money making is of utmost importance and knowing how to make money is considered to be respectable. Therefore, Wall Street investors prioritize their work as well as strive to climb the corporate ladder. They also feel obligated to maintain the image the public creates, because it strengthens their position as a Wall Street employee. They value seeing themselves as experts in their field, especially since they live in a society that values wealth. This justifies their acts of greed, and allows them to take part in activities often deemed as criminal because they feel as though it is expected. Moreover, they do not regret their actions because to them, it is part of being an American. Aside from living up to the public's image, Wall Street workers justify their high salaries with an argument pointed out by Karen Ho in Disciplining Investment Bankers, Disciplining the Economy: Wall Street's Institutional Culture of Crisis, the Downsizing of <b>Corporate</b> <b>America.</b> She argues that {{due to the fact that}} the financial market is volatile in conjunction with the existence of job insecurity, Wall Street workers are compensated through their salaries.|$|E

[...] Zack de la Rocha's lyrics and choruses are defined by a heavy use of sloganeering and repetition on songs like Bulls on Parade, Guerrilla Radio, Testify, and Down Rodeo. Guitarist Tom Morello, on the other hand, was considered the guitar player but also the DJ in Rage.|$|E

In keeping with the political themes of Folie à Deux, the tour featured symbolic commentary on the current state of <b>corporate</b> <b>America.</b> The group began the sets with a [...] "corporate retreat" [...] in which the group performed in dress suits with policemen in riot gear playing drums {{by the side of the}} stage. Afterwards, the band would change to casual attire for the rest of the set.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe defined benefit (DB) pension system that provides retirement security to 44. 5 million Americans faces significant challenges. At {{the end of}} 2003, the system was underfunded by $ 350 billion, there were 82, 696 fewer plans then during the system peak (in 1985), and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) responsible for ensuring retirees receive their retirement benefits even after a plan terminates, reported a deficit of $ 11. 49 billion. This thesis examines the challenges facing the DB pension plan system, beginning with {{an overview of the}} DB plan system, a review of the different plan types, the benefits received, and funding rules. Next, examining the PBGC, its purpose, its organization, and the role that it plays in the DB pension system. Followed by an identification of the challenges facing the pension plan system, and <b>corporate</b> <b>America's</b> frustrations with the system. Finally, the thesis presents some recent reform proposals, and provides <b>corporate</b> <b>America's</b> response to them. A changing workforce demanding leaner retirement options, plans that allow multiple career changes, provide beneficiaries with lump sum benefits, provide early vesting characteristics, and are easily understood, is challenging the future of the DB plan system. To survive the DB plan system must continue to change. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|R

2500|$|Even {{though the}} {{movement}} behind inserting [...] "under God" [...] into the pledge {{might have been}} initiated by a private religious fraternity and even though references to God appear in previous versions of the pledge, author Kevin Kruse asserts that this movement was an effort by <b>corporate</b> <b>America</b> to instill {{in the minds of}} the people that capitalism and free enterprise were heavenly blessed. Kruse acknowledges the insertion of the phrase was influenced by the push-back against atheistic communism during the Cold War, but argues the longer arc of history shows the conflation of Christianity and capitalism as a challenge to the New Deal played the larger role.|$|E

2500|$|Members of {{the upper}} class control and own {{significant}} portions of <b>corporate</b> <b>America</b> and may exercise indirect power through the investment of capital.

There is disagreement over whether the [...] "nouveau riche" [...] should be included as members {{of the upper}} class or whether this term should exclusively be used for established families. Many sociologists and commentators make a distinction between the upper class (in the sense of those in the families of inherited wealth) and the corporate elite.

Some argued that the conservative justices were equally activist, but that their sympathies lay with <b>corporate</b> <b>America.</b> However, general adherence to the principle of stare decisis, along with minority support, left most of the major landmark case decisions (such as Brown, Miranda, and Roe v.
