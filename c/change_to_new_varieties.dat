We are focusing these requirements on accesible credits to small producers, such as the 5 - 5 - 5 credit ($ 5000 dollars to 5 years, 5 %) that the National Government gives though the Banco Nacional de Fomento. It will also serve as a support to SEBIOCA (Espol Entity) to encourage his banana planter clients <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>to</b> this <b>new</b> <b>variety</b> of seed in an appropriate way so it won´t affect its regular economy. At last and the most important purpose of this Project is to stimulate the banana productivity in Ecuadorian households, which are affected most of the time because of the low Price (P) that exporters pay for the fruit, increasing the quantity (Q) of banana production to balance the entries (I) of all banana clients in general. This process will help to the growth of the Ecuadorian PIB...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{was carried out}} to determine the factor of farmer shifting in varieties of coconut production. This study was conducted at Muar, Johor for 4 months. The determination of the factor was classified into three independent factors which there are demographic, attitude and market factor which respond to dependent factor which is farmer shifting in variety and was used six parameters to identify the factor. This study also used interview the farmer and questionnaire {{to carry out the}} survey. About 150 coconut farmers were interview and fill questionnaire form at Muar, Johor. The questionnaire was design in 19 questions which 12 question for independent factor, 3 questions for dependent factor and 4 questions for socio profile of farmers. The 5 questions under demographic factor, 4 questions under attitude factor, 3 questions under market factor, and 3 questions for dependent factor. Result of the study showed that the market factor was significant to farmer shifting in variety of coconut production because there had high demand of <b>new</b> <b>variety</b> in the market and high price in current market. For the demographic factor, there is no influence the farmer to shift in the current <b>variety</b> <b>to</b> <b>new</b> <b>variety.</b> This is because most farmers are not frequent to extension program indirectly slow to use the extension service in their coconut production activity. This will make the farmers not gain new information about a certain variety, so this will indicate that demographic factor does not influence the shifting in variety among coconut farmers. For the attitude factor, the result show attitude factor does not influence farmers to shift from current <b>variety</b> <b>to</b> <b>new</b> <b>variety</b> because the incentive provide by the government still cannot support them to shifting from current <b>variety</b> <b>to</b> <b>new</b> <b>variety.</b> The result also showed that the market factor as a domain factor which influence the farmer shifting in varieties in coconut production...|$|R
