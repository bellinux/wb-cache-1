Because {{of the complexity}} of the processed materials and their properties, manufacturing of rubber products is treated as high-tech technology. This work presents the integration of a new laser beam system on the confection machine of the Savatech Company. The lasers on the confection machine are used to project beams on the intermediate products in order to help a worker to <b>correctly</b> <b>place</b> the <b>materials.</b> The old system of three lasers was adjustable by hand. Manual adjustability was inaccurate, so the mistakes leading to the financial losses were very common. A system for automatic laser beam positioning was made, which decreases the inuence of human factor. By assuring more accurate production of the intermediate products finally produced pneumatics are of better quality. New automatic system for laser positioning includes two lasers, servo motor which is regulated by servo regulator, and movable bus. Our task was to make a program for programmable logic controller and the settings of servo motor. We added new screen on the graphical user interface of the confection machine for following the actions of the automatic positioning system...|$|R

40|$|Simultaneous {{inhibition}} of the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) and raphe obscurus (ROb) decreased the systemic CO 2 response by 51 %, an effect greater than {{inhibition of}} RTN (− 24 %) or ROb (0 %) alone, suggesting that ROb modulates chemoreception by {{interaction with the}} RTN (19). We investigated this interaction further by simultaneous dialysis of artificial cerebrospinal fluid equilibrated with 25 % CO 2 in two probes located in or adjacent to the RTN and ROb in conscious adult male rats. Ventilation was measured in a whole body plethysmograph at 30 °C. There were four groups (n = 5) : 1) probes <b>correctly</b> <b>placed</b> in both RTN and ROb (RTN-ROb); 2) one probe <b>correctly</b> <b>placed</b> in RTN and one incorrectly placed in areas adjacent to ROb (RTN-peri-ROb); 3) one probe <b>correctly</b> <b>placed</b> in ROb and one probe incorrectly placed in areas adjacent to RTN (peri-RTN-ROb); and 4) neither probe <b>correctly</b> <b>placed</b> (peri-RTN-peri-ROb). Focal simultaneous acidification of RTN-ROb significantly increased ventilation (V̇e) up to 22 % compared with baseline, with significant increases in both breathing frequency and tidal volume. Focal acidification of RTN-peri-ROb increased V̇e significantly by up to 15 % compared with baseline. Focal acidification of ROb and peri-RTN had no significant effect. The simultaneous acidification of regions just outside the RTN and ROb actually decreased V̇e by up to 11 %. These results support a modulatory role for the ROb with respect to central chemoreception at the RTN...|$|R

At any time - even before all ten headlines were placed - the contestant could check his or her progress using one of five [...] "hot buttons," [...] which gave the contestant the number of <b>correctly</b> <b>placed</b> headlines, but not the specific headlines that were <b>correctly</b> <b>placed.</b> Placed headlines could be moved to a different year until time expired.|$|R

40|$|The project “Pedicle Screw Placement with Intraoperative EMG Monitoring” is a {{retrospective}} study that hopes {{to narrow the}} findings of previous studies done to find EMG threshold readings in milliamps that correlate to <b>correctly</b> <b>placed</b> pedicle screws. The current literature states that a threshold greater than 8. 0 mA, 11. 0 mA, or 15 mA correlates with an intact pedicle screw. Our study hopes to take data from patients who have had pedicle screws placed at The University of Missouri Hospital and find a more precise EMG threshold that correlates with a <b>correctly</b> <b>placed</b> pedicle screw. The secondary aim {{of the study is}} to determine what changes in the EMG recordings are most predictive of neuronal injury and hence postoperative deficit. It is proposed that breach of the cortex by a pedicle screw leads to a low threshold stimulation of the nerve root when current is applied to the screw head. A retrospective chart review was performed of 97 patients looking at pertinent patient demographic and surgical data which was compiled into a spreadsheet format. This data will be coupled with analysis of post-operative CTs and EMG recordings to determine the most precise current that correlates to a <b>correctly</b> <b>placed</b> pedicle screw without neuronal injury...|$|R
