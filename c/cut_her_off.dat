25|$|Authorities {{initially}} {{arranged for}} Genie's {{admission to the}} Children's Hospital Los Angeles, where a team of doctors and psychologists managed her care for several months, and her subsequent living arrangements {{became the subject of}} rancorous and protracted debate.

Soon after turning 18, in mid-1975, Genie returned to live with her mother, who after a few months decided she could not adequately care for her.

As a result, her physical and mental health severely deteriorated, and her newly acquired language and behavioral skills very rapidly regressed.|$|E
25|$|With Calder's fleet patrolling off Cape Finisterre in {{anticipation}} of the arrival of the combined Franco-Spanish fleet under Pierre-Charles Villeneuve, Prowse and the Sirius, in company with HMS Egyptienne were despatched to scout for the enemy. Villeneuve had been reported as having arrived in the area and on 22 July Prowse located the allied feet, with the frigate Siréne at the rear, towing a captured merchant. Prowse closed on the Siréne, intending to <b>cut</b> <b>her</b> <b>off</b> and board her, but Villeneuve ordered his ships to wear in succession and reverse their course to meet Calder's advancing fleet. Prowse suddenly found himself facing the entire combined fleet, which was fast bearing down on him, led by the Spanish Admiral Federico Gravina aboard the Argonauta. With his tiny frigate heavily outclassed, Prowse began to beat away to leeward as the fleet passed him on the opposite tack. Gravina, aware of the convention that a ship of the line did not open fire on a frigate, ordered that the Sirius not be fired upon and the next Spanish ships also held fire. Shortly afterwards Calder's van came into range of the fleet and a general action ensued, whereby the Sirius was fired on by the España and had two men killed and three wounded. After the battle Prowse was sent to Plymouth with the captured Spanish 74-gun Firme in tow.|$|E
