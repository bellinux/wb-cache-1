40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the development of}} a <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> system in China. We first outline the rationale for having a <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> system through reviewing the literature on asymmetric information. We then proceed to discuss how the <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> system works in China. First we present a case study of a private <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> agency in Chengdu that was established in 2000. This was the first <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> agency in Chengdu and one of the earliest in China. Second, we discuss the progress the People’s Bank of China has made in establishing a unified national <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> system since 2004. It is clear that China has made much progress in developing a <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> system, already operating the largest <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> database in the world.

Individuals who are [...] "rate shopping" [...] for a mortgage, auto loan, or student loan over a short period (two weeks or 45 days, depending on the generation of FICO score used) will likely not experience a meaningful decrease in their scores {{as a result of}} these types of inquiries, as the FICO scoring model considers all of those types of hard inquiries that occur within 14 or 45 days of each other as only one. Further, mortgage, auto, and student loan inquiries do not count at all in a FICO score if they are less than 30 days old. While all credit inquiries are recorded and displayed on personal <b>credit</b> <b>reports</b> for two years, they have no effect after the first year because FICO's scoring system ignores them after 12 months.
