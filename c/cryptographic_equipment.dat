5|$|Henry Edward Roberts studied Electrical Engineering at the University of Miami before enlisting in the U.S. Air Force in 1962. He {{soon became}} an {{electronics}} {{instructor at the}} <b>Cryptographic</b> <b>Equipment</b> Maintenance School at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. To augment his meager enlisted man's pay, Roberts worked on several off-duty projects and even set up a one-man company, Reliance Engineering. The most notable job was to create the electronics that animated the Christmas characters in the window display of Joske's department store in San Antonio. In 1965, he was selected for an Air Force program to complete his college degree, and became a commissioned officer. Roberts earned an Electrical Engineering degree from Oklahoma State University in 1968 and {{was assigned to the}} Weapons Laboratory at Kirtland AFB in Albuquerque, New Mexico.|$|E
25|$|Full-scale {{models of}} her {{pressure}} hull were constructed, and used during mid-1942 for underwater tests of experimental shaped charge anti-submarine bombs. In a highly secret British project, Graph {{was also used}} {{as a model for}} the construction of three, full-sized, mock-ups of the control compartment, wardroom and radio room of a Type VII U-boat. These were used to train specialist groups of sailors, who would form boarding parties whenever a damaged U-boat was blown to the surface. They were trained to operate a U-boat's ballast-tank valves, to reverse any scuttling attempts by the crew, and to search quickly for <b>cryptographic</b> <b>equipment</b> and documents.|$|E

50|$|The AN/CYZ-10 Data Transfer Device, {{often called}} a Filler, Crazy 10, ANCD or DTD, is a United States National Security Agency-developed, portable, {{hand-held}} fill device, for securely receiving, storing, and transferring data between compatible <b>cryptographic</b> and communications <b>equipment.</b> It {{is capable of}} storing 1,000 keys, maintains an automatic internal audit trail of all security-relevant events that can be uploaded to the LMD/KP, encrypts key for storage, and is programmable. The DTD is capable of keying multiple information systems security (INFOSEC) devices and is compatible with such COMSEC equipment as Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) radios, KY-57 VINSON, KG-84, and others that are keyed by common fill devices (CFDs). The AN/CYZ-10 supports both the DS-101 and DS-102 interfaces.|$|R
50|$|The AN/PYQ-10 Simple Key Loader (SKL) is a ruggedized, portable, {{hand-held}} fill device, for securely receiving, storing, and transferring data between compatible <b>cryptographic</b> {{and communications}} <b>equipment.</b> The SKL {{was designed and}} built by Ralph Osterhout and then sold to Sierra Nevada Corporation, with software developed by Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) {{under the auspices of}} the United States Army. It is intended to supplement and eventually replace the AN/CYZ-10 Data Transfer Device (DTD). The PYQ-10 provides all the functions currently resident in the CYZ-10 and incorporates new features that provide streamlined management of COMSEC key, Electronic Protection (EP) data, and Signal Operating Instructions (SOI). Cryptographic functions are performed by an embedded KOV-21 card developed by the National Security Agency (NSA). The AN/PYQ-10 supports both the DS-101 and DS-102 interfaces, as well as the KSD-64 Crypto Ignition Key. The SKL is backward-compatible with existing End Cryptographic Units (ECU) and forward-compatible with future security equipment and systems, including NSA's Key Management Infrastructure.|$|R
