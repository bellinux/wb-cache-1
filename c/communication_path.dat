40|$|A {{promising}} {{approach to}} access efficient network services in dynamic network environment {{is to provide}} network awareness in <b>communication</b> <b>paths.</b> Network services across a wide area network still remains a challenging task and the difficulty mainly comes from the heterogeneous and constantly changing network environment, which usually causes undesirable user experience for network-oblivious applications. A promising approach to address this is to provide network awareness in <b>communication</b> <b>paths.</b> Many challenging problems remain, in particular: how to automatically create effective network paths whose performance is optimized for encountered network conditions; how to dynamically reconfigure such paths when network conditions change; and how to manage and distribute network resources among different paths and between different network regions. This paper describes solutions for these problems, built into a programmable network infrastructure called Switching Network Services (SNS). The SNS infrastructure provides applications with network-aware <b>communication</b> <b>paths</b> that are automatically created and dynamically modified...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{amount of}} software and computational capabilities in voice endpoints, switches, and networks creates {{an opportunity for}} embedding advanced applications in voice <b>communication</b> <b>paths.</b> Particularly in an enterprise environment, such applications can alter the traditional behavior of voice communications from simply connecting two or more people to software-assisted connection establishment and enhanced on-call features. In this paper, we claim that embedding context-aware applications in <b>communication</b> <b>paths</b> can greatly increase the efficiency, effectiveness, and convenience of enterprise communications and thus the productivity of enterprise users. We identify the challenges associated with embedding context-aware applications in <b>communication</b> <b>paths</b> and exemplify our central claim by presenting a context-aware voice communications application CallerID++. CallerID++ aims at improving the aged concept of caller ID {{as the basis for}} a callee’s decision to accept or reject an incoming call. Through a call acceptance negotiation between caller and callee prior to call establishment, CallerID++ allows the callee to assess the importance of an incoming call relative to the callee’s current activity. CallerID++ thus helps minimizing unwanted interruptions without rejecting important calls. 1...|$|R

As packet based networks are becoming the common transport for most applications requiring {{clock synchronization}}, accuracy requirements are becoming increasingly stringent. In this paper we introduce a novel approach that uses multiple <b>communication</b> <b>paths</b> between the master and slave clocks to improve the clock accuracy without increasing the total rate of protocol messages.

40|$|Abstract: While {{software}} {{building blocks}} and their interdependencies can be {{recovered from the}} source code using static fact extraction, behavior and <b>communication</b> <b>paths</b> at runtime are typically gathered from instrumented executions of the system. However, {{more often than not}} {{it is not possible to}} retrieve data from the running system – either due to a high effort for instrumentation, missing (hardware) infrastructure, or because of advanced communication mechanisms hidden by middleware, frameworks or platforms. In this paper, we present an approach to semiautomatically reconstruct runtime components and connectors using source code analysis, pattern matching, and expert knowledge. We present two applications where we could recover runtime <b>communication</b> <b>paths</b> and component interactions despite the absence of runtime traces. ...|$|R
