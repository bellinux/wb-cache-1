50|$|The <b>double-eyed</b> <b>fig</b> <b>parrot</b> {{generally}} forages for figs, berries, seeds, nectar, and the grubs of wood-boring insects. This foraging is done {{in pairs}} or in a flock {{of only a few}} individuals. It tends to fly in a quick and direct manner. It produces a short and shrill call. Unlike many other parrots which generally use existing holes in trees for nests, <b>double-eyed</b> <b>fig</b> <b>parrots</b> excavate their own nest cavities, usually in a rotten tree.|$|R

50|$|Eight {{subspecies}} of the <b>double-eyed</b> <b>fig</b> <b>parrot</b> are described. The {{first five}} {{are restricted to}} New Guinea and associated islands; the last three are restricted to Australia.|$|R
50|$|As {{with other}} {{subspecies}} of the <b>double-eyed</b> <b>fig</b> <b>parrot,</b> Coxen's <b>fig</b> <b>parrot</b> excavates its own nesting hollow in decaying wood of living or dead forest trees. Although signs of nest excavating have been found, no active nests have been recorded.|$|R
50|$|Coxen's <b>fig</b> <b>parrot</b> (Cyclopsitta diophthalma coxeni), {{also known}} as the blue-browed, red-faced or {{southern}} <b>fig</b> <b>parrot</b> or lorilet, is one of the smallest and least known Australian parrots.

5000|$|<b>Fig</b> <b>parrots</b> [...] {{are a small}} tribe (Cyclopsittini) {{consisting}} of five species in two small genera of parrots (Cyclopsitta and Psittaculirostris) of the family Psittaculidae found in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and tropical Australia. The <b>double-eyed</b> <b>fig</b> <b>parrot</b> is 13-16 cm in length and is the smallest Australian parrot.|$|R
50|$|The <b>double-eyed</b> <b>fig</b> <b>parrot</b> (Cyclopsitta diophthalma), {{also known}} as the blue-faced <b>fig</b> <b>parrot,</b> red-faced <b>fig</b> <b>parrot,</b> dwarf <b>fig</b> <b>parrot,</b> and the two-eyed <b>fig</b> <b>parrot,</b> {{primarily}} inhabits forests on New Guinea and nearby islands, but is also found in isolated communities along the tropical Australian coast, east of the Great Dividing Range. With an average total length of about 14 cm, it is the smallest parrot in Australia.|$|R
50|$|<b>Double-eyed</b> <b>fig</b> <b>parrots</b> utter high-pitched, clipped, two {{or three}} note zzzt-zzzt or zeet-zeet calls, unlike the rolling or trilling screeches typical of lorikeets. These calls are mostly made in flight, but {{sometimes}} when perched. When engrossed in feeding, it may also make a variety of softer, chattering noises.|$|R
5000|$|Australia holds three <b>fig</b> <b>parrot</b> taxa, all {{of which}} are {{subspecies}} of the <b>double-eyed</b> <b>fig</b> <b>parrot</b> (Cyclopsitta diophthalma), which is also found in New Guinea. Inhabiting the rainforest canopy, they are tiny (14 cm in length), mostly green in colour, with various red and blue markings on and around the face. The three distinct and geographically discrete Australian subspecies are: ...|$|R
50|$|Most {{subspecies}} of the <b>double-eyed</b> <b>fig</b> <b>parrot</b> {{are sexually}} dimorphic, with males having more red (less silvery and blue) {{to the face}} than the females. It is predominantly green with a very short tail, a disproportionately large head and bill, and red and blue facial markings. Its name {{is derived from the}} cheek patches of some subspecies that vaguely resemble eyes.|$|R
50|$|Birds {{are found}} in ones or twos, {{although}} groups of up to 35 individuals may gather at fruit trees. Their predominantly green plumage makes them hard to spot against foliage. They have been recorded feeding with <b>double-eyed</b> <b>fig</b> <b>parrots,</b> fruit pigeons (Ptilinopus), honeyeaters, and starlings. They consume fruit including figs. Nesting takes place in small hollows high up in large trees, although {{little is known about}} this aspect of their behaviour.|$|R
50|$|Ficus hispida is a {{small but}} well {{distributed}} species of tropical fig tree. It occurs {{in many parts of}} Asia and as far south east as Australia. There is a large variety of local common names. Like a number of ficus, the leaves are sandpapery to touch. An unusual feature is the figs which hang on long stems. In Australia the fruit are eaten by cassowaries and <b>double-eyed</b> <b>fig</b> <b>parrots.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ficus variegata {{is a well}} {{distributed}} {{species of}} tropical fig tree. It occurs {{in many parts of}} Asia, islands of the Pacific and as far south east as Australia. There is a large variety of local common names including common red stem fig, green fruited fig and variegated fig. A non strangling fig which may reach 30 metres in height. In Australia the fruit are eaten by cassowaries and <b>double-eyed</b> <b>fig</b> <b>parrots.</b>|$|R
50|$|Coxen's <b>fig</b> <b>parrot</b> {{is about}} 15-16 cm long, {{larger than the}} other {{subspecies}} of <b>double-eyed</b> <b>fig</b> <b>parrot.</b> Its very short tail gives it a top-heavy, big-headed appearance. It is predominantly bright yellowish-green in colour with a blue forehead surrounded by a few scattered red feathers, and with orange-red cheeks bordered below by a variable mauve-blue band. The female is similar in appearance to the male, though slightly duller in colouration. Its flight is rapid and direct, generally above the forest canopy. It can be distinguished from little and musk lorikeets by its dumpier build, more rounded wings and seemingly tail-less silhouette. In flight its call is harsher and more staccato {{than that of the}} little lorikeet. However, because it is small, rare, green, silent when feeding and tends to stay high in the foliage of the forest canopy, it is very seldom seen.|$|R
5|$|The <b>double-eyed</b> <b>fig</b> <b>parrot</b> (Cyclopsitta diophthalma) {{eats the}} fruit of Ficus obliqua, {{steadily}} depositing fruity detritus on the ground. The rainbow lorikeet (Trichoglossus moluccanus) is another parrot that consumes the fruit and disperses the seeds; other Australian bird species include the southern cassowary (Casuarius casuarius), brown cuckoo-dove (Macropygia phasianella), rose-crowned fruit dove (Ptilinopus regina), wompoo fruit dove (P. magnificus), wonga pigeon (Leucosarcia melanoleuca), topknot pigeon (Lopholaimus antarcticus), silvereye (Zosterops lateralis), pied currawong (Strepera graculina), black-faced cuckoo-shrike (Coracina novaehollandae), olive-backed oriole (Oriolus sagittatus), Australasian figbird (Sphecotheres vieilloti), green catbird (Ailuroedus crassirostris), regent bowerbird (Sericulus chrysocephalus), satin bowerbird (Ptilonorhynchus violaceus), and Lewin's honeyeater (Meliphaga lewinii). The tree is an important food source for the western Polynesian species the many-coloured fruit dove (Ptilinopus perousii) and crimson-crowned fruit dove (P. porphyraceus), and has been recommended for amenity planting in Tonga for these birds. The spectacled flying fox (Pteropus conspicillatus) and grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus) also eat the fruit.|$|R
