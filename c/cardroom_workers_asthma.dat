Being exposed to indoor air {{pollutants}} in the workplace makes it difficult to control asthma and can lead to asthma attacks. This study was conducted by a workplace physician of a textile factory in Denizli, 2009, and it was investigated whether <b>workers</b> with <b>asthma</b> were affected or not in the workplace. Material and Method: Some data about health/diseases status and individual characteristics of 41 workers who had previously been diagnosed with asthma were collected. Spirometric measurements were made. PEF (peak expiratory flow) meters recordings were made 4 times a day during 4 weeks to indicate the effects of the workplace. PEF rates were calculated using the measurements before and after the shift. Results: There were 1553 workers in the factory and 41 of them had asthma (2. 6 %). Twenty-eight of them were female. Nearly half of the <b>workers</b> with <b>asthma</b> were smoking more than 5 cigarettes per day. PFT (pulmonary function test) measurements were lower in <b>workers</b> with <b>asthma.</b> PFT measurements were lower in current smoker <b>workers</b> with <b>asthma</b> than in nonsmoker. When we evaluated PEF measurements; we found 8 % decrease between the start and end of the shifts. Nearly half of the PFT results of <b>asthma</b> <b>workers</b> were found to be normal. Daily PEFR variability of more than 20 % was 4. 4 %. Conclusion: The 75. 6 % of asthmatic workers were current smokers. Also, all workers having a daily PEFR variability higher than 20 % were current smokers. These findings indicate that smoking is the most important problem that must be solved.

The objective of this thesis was to investigate associations between {{a broad array of}} different factors and sick leave in <b>workers</b> with <b>asthma</b> and COPD. Factors we investigated were disease characteristics, health complaints, functional limitations, work characteristics, psychosocial variables, and workers? knowledge about the management of the disease and about their diagnosis. We especially focused on adaptation to functional limitations regarding sick leave. Adaptation is considered as an active way of coping in which an individual adapts to the chronic disorder he is suffering from. This involves a behavioural change, in which he accepts the consequences of the chronic disorder and adapts to this situation. We conducted three studies. First, a qualitative study was conducted using focusgroup interviews (2001). For the second study, a cohort of 189 <b>workers</b> with <b>asthma</b> and COPD underwent a pulmonary function test and completed questionnaires (2002). In the third study, 165 participants completed questionnaires again after one year. The main finding of this study was that inadequate adaptation was associated with sick leave in <b>workers</b> with <b>asthma</b> and COPD. Secondly, within a population of <b>workers</b> with <b>asthma</b> and COPD, parameters expressing the severity of the disease, such as level of pulmonary obstruction (FEV 1), were not associated with sick leave.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} {{study was to investigate}} predictors of 1 -year changes in sick leave in <b>workers</b> with <b>asthma.</b> METHODS: The initial cohort consisted of 111 <b>workers</b> with <b>asthma.</b> One-hundred and one participants completed the follow-up after 1 year. Self-reported sick leave over the past 12 months was reported at baseline and at follow-up. At the start of this study, all participants completed questionnaires on adaptation to functional limitations, psychosocial variables, working conditions, lung function characteristics, disease history characteristics, health complaints and functional limitations, and person characteristics ('potential predictors'). Three multivariate logistic regression models were calculated, with an increase in sick leave, a decrease in sick leave, and stable high sick leave as dependent (outcome) variables, and the potential predictors as independent (explanatory) variables. RESULTS: An increase in sick leave was predicted by a lower level of education and perceiving more functional limitations in activities of daily life. A decrease in sick leave was predicted by spending all energy at work less often and perceiving fewer health complaints in social activities (adaptation criteria 4 and 5). Stable high sick leave was predicted by less job satisfaction, perceiving more support from the employer and perceiving more health complaints in social activities (adaptation criterion 5). Lung function characteristics, or disease history characteristics were not predictive for changes in sick leave in any of the groups. CONCLUSION: We conclude that adaptation to functional limitations {{played a major role in}} changes in sick leave in <b>workers</b> with <b>asthma.</b> Lung function characteristics hardly played a role...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{exploratory}} {{study was to investigate}} associations between sick leave in <b>workers</b> with <b>asthma</b> or COPD and disease-related variables, psychosocial variables, and work characteristics. Hundred and eighty-nine patients with physician-diagnosed asthma (N= 118) or COPD (n= 71) who had paid work in the past 12 months completed questionnaires on sick leave, health complaints, functional limitations, work characteristics and psychosocial issues, and underwent a pulmonary function test (FEV 1 and FVC before and after bronchodilation). Logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate variables independently associated with high sick leave (i. e. more than twice a year and/or longer than 1 month per episode). Asthma patients, not having an emotionally difficult job, with low job satisfaction, who had changed employers, utilized job control, and who encountered pulmonary aggravating factors at work were found to have a higher incidence of sick leave. COPD patients, who had informed the employer or colleagues about the disease, who did not have difficult tasks at work, who did not hide dyspnea and limitations, and who reported high fatigue were showing higher sick leave.

40|$|Lung {{cancer risk}} in {{subjects}} exposed to organic dust: an unexpected and surprising story In a recently published multicentre caseâ€“ control study evaluating lung cancer risk among subjects exposed to organic dusts, 1 the authors could not confirm {{the findings from}} previous reports in which a decreased risk was found among workers in the cotton industry and animal farmers. 2 Regarding a decreased risk of lung cancer among cotton workers 3 â€“ 7 the authors quite rightly concluded that their material was not suitable to evaluate this relationship as their subgroups did not reflect the critical exposure groups, i. e. those exposed {{to high levels of}} endotoxin such as <b>cardroom</b> <b>workers</b> and weavers. 8 For farmers we believe that the multicen-tre caseâ€“control study findings have the same shortcomings for the following reasons. In the Veneto region of Italy, where the first study reporting a decreased risk of lung cancer among farmers was carried out, 9 the number of farmers has progres-sively decreased over the last three decades. People leaving dairy farming have taken employment in industries and services in which the exposure level to organic dusts is low. In a cohort of dairy farmers enrolled in this region, the number of active workers in 1998 was 541 of 5634 (9. 6 %) workers who reported working in dairy farms sometime during their lifetime. 10 The results in the cohort study suggest an exposure-dependent reduction in the risk of lung cancer for dairy farmers during the observation period 1970 â€“ 1984, when most subjects were working on their farms, but not during the period 1985 â€“ 1998 when they presumably had other occupations. A cohort nested caseâ€“control study controlling for age and smoking habits confirmed that recent exposure to dairy farm dust protected against lung cancer while this protective effect was no longer present when more than 15 years had elapsed since working on the farm to the end of follow-up or death. 10 Because protection by endotoxin-containing dust seems to diminish over time after the cessation of exposure, the increased risk of lung cancer reported in the multicentre caseâ€“control study would pre-sumably be an effect of other exposures, as shown by the association between occupa-tional exposure to diesel exhaust and lung cancer which has recently been reported in the same set of cases and controls. 1...|$|R

The long-term effect of exposure as well as the widespread use of hypoallergenic gloves warrant further investigation on larger cohorts of subjects...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Powder {{painting}} {{is an alternative}} to solvent-based spray painting. Powder paints may contain organic acid anhydrides (OAAs), which are irritants to the airways and may cause sensitisation. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of respiratory symptoms and immunological response among powder painters and to describe the exposure to OAAs. Methods: In all, 205 subjects in 32 enterprises participated: 93 exposed and 26 formerly exposed workers in 25 powder paint shops and 86 unexposed workers. They completed a questionnaire about working conditions and symptoms and took part in a medical examination, which included a lung function test. Urine samples, for determination of two OAAs, and blood samples, for analysis of specific antibodies against the OAAs, were taken. In addition, 33 paint samples were analysed for nine OAAs. Results: The powder painters reported more work-related respiratory symptoms than unexposed subjects did. The prevalence of three or more symptoms was 24 % in subjects with low exposure, 44 % in highly exposed individuals, 46 % in formerly exposed subjects and 19 % in unexposed <b>workers.</b> <b>Asthma</b> symptoms were frequent, 7 %, 40 %, 15 % and 2 %, respectively. Regression analyses of the lung volumes did not show any influence of exposure. IgG, but not IgE, against the OAAs and metabolites of OAAs was found in some subjects, but no associations with the exposure could be observed. OAAs were found in only small amounts in the paint samples. Conclusions: The exposure to organic acid anhydrides was estimated to be low, and yet, IgG antibodies to OAA were observed in some subjects. The prevalence of work-related symptoms from the eyes and the airways was relatively high among the powder painters, and these symptoms, but not the lung volumes, were clearly related to exposure. The symptoms were probably caused by irritative properties of the powder paint dust...|$|R

Methods: Between 1970 and 1990 in a Dutch aluminium-production plant, 179 workers had been diagnosed as having potroom asthma. We carried out a follow-up study (n = 122) in the population still present at the factory 5 years after their relocation to an exposure-free department.

To correct for confounding factors, we included age, pre-employment FEV 1 -% pred, allergy, medical treatment, and smoking in the analysis. Results: The mean FEV 1 -% pred at follow-up was within the normal range (90. 3, SD 13. 5). Long exposure time was significantly associated with a low FEV 1 -% pred at follow-up (P = 0. 0046).

The present study was conducted to determine the role of occupational exposure as a determinant of occurrence of bronchial asthma and to assess the possible role of total serum IgE; eosinophil count and GSTM 1 and GSTT 1 null polymorphism as risk factors for the development of bronchial asthma. MethodsA case control study was conducted in which 100 <b>workers</b> with bronchial <b>asthma</b> were compared to 100 non asthmatic controls regarding their occupational characteristics, bronchodilator responsiveness, blood analysis for eosinophil count, total serum IgE, GSTM 1 and GSTT 1 genotypes. ResultsExposure to irritants and allergens were significantly higher among <b>workers</b> with bronchial <b>asthma</b> compared to controls (86 % vs. 64 %, respectively, P= 0. 00). Moreover, workers exposed to irritants were found to be 4 times at a higher risk of developing bronchial asthma, and those exposed to high molecular weight (HMW), and/or low molecular weight (LMW) were about three times at a higher risk of developing bronchial asthma. There was no significant difference detected between the cases of bronchial asthma and the controls regarding the frequency of the Null-genotype for either GSTT 1 or GSTM 1. However, the frequency of combined Null-genotype for both GSTT 1 and GSTM 1 was significantly higher in asthmatic workers than in controls. A significant positive correlation was found between total serum IgE level and pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC% (r= 0. 29, and P= 0. 03). ConclusionOccupational exposure to irritants and/or allergens is a significant risk factor for the occurrence of bronchial <b>asthma</b> among <b>workers.</b> On the other hand, eosinophil count and total serum IgE neither predicts the occurrence of bronchial asthma nor affects the severity and pattern of the disease among <b>workers</b> with bronchial <b>asthma.</b> Moreover, the present study concluded that GSTM 1 and GSTT 1 Null-genotypes are not likely to act as risk factors for the development of bronchial asthma.

40|$|Asthma is {{a common}} chronic illness {{characterized}} by episodes of reversible airflow obstruction. A cornerstone of asthma management is identifying and avoiding agents that cause bronchospasm. The workplace is an important potential source of respirable exposures that can cause or trigger asthma.

Although BAL CD 8 + lymphocytes predominate in both diseases, CD 4 /CD 8 ratio is significantly higher in BFD.

While patients with HP had high IgG reactivity tomoulds and especially recognized Penicillium glabrum antigens of molecular weight of 12 - 13. 5 kDa and 33 kDa, we could not find evidence of IgE sensitisation to these fungi in asthmatics. Cork workerâ€™s Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis has a different clinical profile compared with Bird Fancierâ€™s Disease, suggesting that different antigenic ex-posures may result in a different dynamic of the lung immune/inflammatory response.

Recent studies indicate that asthma is a frequent manifestation of NRL allergy among workers manufacturing NRL materials and among health-care providers using NRL <b>workers.</b> NRL-induced <b>asthma</b> should receive increasing attention as it can lead to permanent respiratory sequelae and occupational disability. The need for early and accurate diagnosis is outlined and the different diagnostic approaches are reviewed. Specific issues pertaining to the management of affected subjects and to the prevention of exposure to airborne NRL are discussed. Ares of future research should include: 1) further characterization of relevant NRL allergens; 2) development and validation of methods for quantitative assessment of allergen content in NRL devices and workplace environment; 3) evaluation of the natural history and risk factors of NRL-induced asthma; and 5) analysis of effectiveness and cost of preventive strategies...|$|R
40|$|Various {{reactive}} dyes can elicit occupational asthma in exposed {{textile industry}} workers. To date, {{there has been}} no report of occupational asthma caused by the red dye Synozol Red-K 3 BS (Red-K). Here, we report a 38 -year-old male textile <b>worker</b> with occupational <b>asthma</b> and rhinitis induced by inhalation of Red-K. He showed positive responses to Red-K extract on skin-prick testing and serum specific IgE antibodies to Red-K-human serum albumin conjugate were detected using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A bronchoprovocation test with Red-K extract resulted in significant bronchoconstriction. These findings suggest that the inhalation of the reactive dye Red-K can induce IgE-mediated occupational asthma and rhinitis in exposed workers...|$|R
40|$|Asthma {{prevalence}} {{continues to}} increase across the United States of America, affecting more than 43. 1 million people and projected to affect over 50 million people by 2025. Asthma prevalence differs by demographic characteristics, such as race, ethnicity, socio-economic status, education, age and gender. Poor {{quality of life is}} common among people who suffer from asthma, in addition to school and work absenteeism. In 2008, children 5 - 17 years old with at least one reported asthma attack missed 10. 5 million school days in the past year (CDC, 2010). Healthcare use for asthma is high and disparities remain in asthma healthcare use and reimbursement. In community settings, reimbursement for asthma education and prevention has been problematic due to current reimbursement mechanisms (Bodenheimer et al. (2003); Halterman (2010); CDC (2011) and Laster et al. 2010) that do not go far enough in assisting low-income communities manage their asthma medically nor have uniform standards for billable services associated with asthma management provided by both healthcare professionals and public health workers. A change in reimbursement policy is advocated and the evidence for the effectiveness of community health <b>workers</b> in <b>asthma</b> management is examined...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{associations of}} sick leave in 165 <b>workers</b> with <b>asthma</b> and COPD with three {{components of the}} Model of Planned Behavior (MPB) : attitudes, social norms towards sick leave, and perceived control over sick leave and over health complaints. All participants underwent lung-function tests and completed questionnaires on sick leave, and on the MPB-components. Differences were calculated {{between high and low}} sick leave (frequency and duration) for the total group of asthma and COPD and separately for asthma and COPD. The most relevant variable within each MPB-component was selected for multivariate analysis. In the total group and in the group with asthma, low sick leave was associated with more perceived control over fatigue. In COPD, the attitude 'finding the negative consequences of sick leave more unpleasant' was associated with high sick leave. It was concluded that similarities exist in a population of asthma and COPD patients, but that different MPB-components play a role in sick leave in asthma and COPD. Perceived control over health complaints is more important in asthma than in COPD. Attitudes towards sick leave appear to be more important in COPD patients...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that bakery <b>workers</b> may develop <b>asthma</b> and {{rhinitis}} {{as a result of}} their occupation and approximately 30 % of bakery workers and wheat farmers will become sensitised. This ratio can change depending on the exposure time and a history of atopy. The present study has looked at the relationship between nasal and environmental flora and pulmonary function in such workers to see if it can explain the occurrence of <b>asthma</b> and rhinitis. <b>Workers</b> from three of the largest bakery companies in Istanbul were recruited, a total of 372 people; 223 bakery workers and 149 administrative employees of the same companies as a control group. Face to face interviews were con-ducted to determine asthma status and all were give...|$|R
