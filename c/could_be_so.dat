25|$|While {{most experts}} agreed that a torpedo had exploded, they {{differed}} on {{what caused the}} explosion. Many Russians {{did not believe that}} Kursk <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> easily sunk. The tragedy spawned a number of wild conspiracy theories to explain the disaster. One theory offered was an explosion located in the high-pressure air tanks used to blow the ballast tanks, located near the torpedo tubes. Mainstream publications like Der Spiegel, Berliner Zeitung, and the Sunday Times claimed to possess documentation proving that the submarine was struck by a missile fired by Pyotr Velikiy. This was the largest naval exercise that the Russian navy had conducted in more than a decade, which increased the chances of a friendly fire incident. Other theories included Chechen espionage, human error, sabotage, and that Kursk was testing a new top-secret torpedo, Shkval (Squall), capable of speeds in excess of , for which the Western navies have no defence. Another theory was that USS Memphis had fired a torpedo at Kursk.|$|E
25|$|Newton's theory {{could be}} used to predict the {{reflection}} of light, but could only explain refraction by incorrectly assuming that light accelerated upon entering a denser medium because the gravitational pull was greater. Newton published the final version of his theory in his Opticks of 1704. His reputation helped the particle theory of light to hold sway during the 18th century. The particle theory of light led Laplace to argue that a body <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> massive that light could not escape from it. In other words, it would become what is now called a black hole. Laplace withdrew his suggestion later, after a wave theory of light became firmly established as the model for light (as has been explained, neither a particle or wave theory is fully correct). A translation of Newton's essay on light appears in The large scale structure of space-time, by Stephen Hawking and George F. R. Ellis.|$|E

25|$|The two craft {{were brought}} down to Langstone Harbour for {{competitive}} trials. On its trials on a misty morning, {{the noise from}} the two 120hp Chryslers in the Birmabright alloy hull scared some mothers who hurried their children away from the Isle of Wight beaches as the craft came inshore. The conclusions of the trial left no one in doubt. A platoon of Royal Marines disembarked from the Fleming craft in {{a quarter of the}} time taken by the platoon in the Thornycroft, the silhouette of the Fleming craft was less, it created less disturbance when steaming, and it beached better. But, and this was later the deciding factor, the Birmabright craft was so noisy that it meant sacrificing tactical surprise, while it was impossible to mount armour on its sides. The failings of the Thornycroft craft on the other hand could all be overcome. A second prototype from Thornycroft had a double-diagonal mahogany hull with twin engines and those features — low silhouette, quiet engines, little bow wave — which appealed to the Centre's staff in their search for a craft that could make surprise landings. The craft beached satisfactorily, a quality retained in all LCA designs, but the troops took too long to disembark across this prototype's narrow ramp. Armour could easily take the place of the outer mahogany planking, the exit could be lowered, the silhouette could be cut down and the engines <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> silenced {{that they would not be}} heard at twenty-five yards. So although the Fleming boat won at the trial, it was the Thornycroft design, duly altered, that became the assault landing craft. A third prototype — ALC No 2 — was therefore built after the DNC had worked with Thornycroft on modifications to the design.|$|E

500|$|A {{typical power}} divider {{is shown in}} figure 13. [...] Ideally, input power would be divided equally between the output ports. [...] Dividers are made up of {{multiple}} couplers and, like couplers, may be reversed and used as multiplexers. [...] The drawback is that for a four channel multiplexer, the output consists of only 1/4 the power from each, and is relatively inefficient. [...] The {{reason for this is that}} at each combiner half the input power goes to port 4 and is dissipated in the termination load. [...] If the two inputs were coherent the phases <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> arranged that cancellation occurred at port 4 and then all the power would go to port 1. [...] However, multiplexer inputs are usually from entirely independent sources and therefore not coherent.

500|$|Lasser {{was one of}} {{the founders}} of the American Rocket Society which, under its initial name of the [...] "Interplanetary Society", {{announced}} its existence in the pages of the June 1930 Wonder Stories. Several of Wonders writers were also members of the Interplanetary Society, and perhaps as a consequence of the relationship Wonder Stories Quarterly began to focus increasingly on fiction with interplanetary settings. A survey of the last eight issues of Wonder Stories Quarterly by Bleiler found almost two-thirds of the stories were interplanetary adventures, while only a third of the stories in the corresponding issues of Wonder Stories <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> described. Wonder Stories Quarterly added a banner reading [...] "Interplanetary Number" [...] to the cover of the Winter 1931 issue, and retained it, as [...] "Interplanetary Stories", for subsequent issues. Lasser and Gernsback were also briefly involved with the fledgling Technocracy movement. Gernsback published two issues of Technocracy Review, which Lasser edited, commissioning stories based on technocratic ideas from Nat Schachner. These appeared in Wonder Stories during 1933, culminating in a novel, The Revolt of the Scientists.|$|E
