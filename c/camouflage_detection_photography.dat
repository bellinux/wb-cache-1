Here, we present an approach to enhance human color vision by breaking its inherent binocular redundancy, providing different spectral content to each eye. We fabricated and tested a set of optical filters that "splits" the response of the short-wavelength cone between the two eyes in individuals with typical trichromatic vision, simulating the presence of approximately four distinct cone types ("tetrachromacy"). Such {{an increase in the number}} of simulated cone types can reduce the prevalence of metamers - pairs of distinct spectra that resolve to the same perceived color.

40|$|This thesis proposes an {{improvement}} on segmentation of camouflaged objects by combining information from multiple static cameras with overlapping views onto a common reference plane. Previous <b>camouflage</b> <b>detection</b> work {{relies on a}} single camera and focuses on pattern recognition, gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) computation, convexity detection and operations such as connected components or morphology. These methods make real-time implementation computationally expensive. The proposed work diverges from these techniques, {{taking advantage of the}} added information from several viewpoints. Background subtraction is performed on each individual camera and then, the segmentation result is transformed onto a common plane using homography. A multiple camera view is generated by averaging the transformed views from each camera. This multiple camera view is used to achieve a better segmentation of the camouflaged object. A multi-camera surveillance system is developed in Matlab as part of this research. The surveillance system includes processes such as classification, centroid calculation, tracking using a Kalman Filter and bounding the target with a rectangle. In addition, a graphic user interface was designed to be able to choose from several cameras, viewpoints and motion detection methods. ^ Experiments were run to test the performance of the background subtraction method versus two other reference model methods. Tests were also run to observe the challenges faced by background subtraction under camouflaged conditions. Additional experiments compare the tracking from individual cameras to the results from the Kalman Filter and Multi-Camera Average. The computation time between the proposed method and GLCM was also studied. The results indicate that a multiple camera surveillance system provides an improved segmentation of a camouflaged target and is capable of tracking targets more consistently than individual cameras. Further results indicate that a multi-camera system can perform faster than GLCM in some circumstances. ...|$|R

Here, we used online “citizen science” games to test how quickly humans could detect cryptic birds (incubating nightjars) and eggs (of nightjars, plovers and coursers) under trichromatic and simulated dichromatic viewing conditions. Trichromats had an overall advantage, although there were significant differences in performance between viewing conditions. When searching for consistently shaped and patterned adult nightjars, simulated dichromats were more heavily influenced by the degree of pattern difference than were trichromats, and were poorer at detecting prey with inferior pattern and luminance camouflage. When searching for clutches of eggs—which were more variable in appearance and shape than the adult nightjars—the simulated dichromats learnt to detect the clutches faster, but were less sensitive to subtle luminance differences. These results suggest there are substantial differences in the cues available under viewing conditions that simulate different receptor types, and that these interact with the scene in complex ways to affect camouflage breaking.

40|$|Radiation {{emissions}} within territories that accommodate {{nuclear power}} facilities are monitored by stationary gamma radiation measuring systems. Any facilities that may contemplate the hazard of radioactive emissions {{must meet the}} safety requirements {{both in terms of}} normal conditions of their operation and in case of accidents. Thus, radioactive materials now in use must comply with strict rules. The account for and control of radioactive materials, their proper application, compliance with the rules and security measures minimize their impact on the environment. However, the loss of professional control over the above materials (various emergencies, losses in the course of transportation, plunders) may involve serious consequences. One of the most effective ways of reconnaissance of territories exposed to radioactive contamination to assure the search for the sources of radionuclides represents remote measurement of surface gamma radiation performed by radiation meters installed on unmanned airborne vehicles (UMAV). The main advantage of UMAV is that it may be used as the carrier of radiation meters. In addition to the gamma radiation meter, the system can take a video of different sources of hazards. The article demonstrates the results of tests of the unmanned radiation meter designated for remote sensing of the surface gamma radiation. The option of assessment of the intensity of the radiation and the concentrations of radionuclide fields is considered.

40|$|Since the {{astronomer}} and composer Sir Frederick William Herschel (1738 - 1822) discovered in 1800 the infrared {{portion of the}} electromagnetic spectrum, many other scientists became interested {{in this kind of}} invisible radiation. It lasted, however, until 1904 for the first near-infrared photograph to be taken. From the 1930 s onwards, this unusual type of imaging was practised more elaborately, specifically to examine damaged and censored writings or study blood patterns for medical purposes. After 1935 – the year in which one of the earliest infrared aerial photographs was taken from a stratosphere balloon – the trend was set. Less than a decade afterwards, aerial infrared colour film became extensively used for its <b>camouflage</b> <b>detection</b> capabilities in WWII. Today, orbital and aerial NIR recording serves a great number of applications, being intensively used by the military as well as the scientific fields of hydrology, geology, forestry and archaeology. Up till now, NIR radiation was mostly captured in an analogue way by infrared sensitive plates or film emulsions (black-and-white or colour), or digitally by satellites or high-tech multispectral sensors. For various reasons (cost, resolving power, lack of hardware etc.), aerial archaeologists use(d) the analogue NIR approach to study their objects (some examples are – amongst others – the work of Bradford, Strandberg, Solecki, Edienne and Martin). Such a film-based workflow is however very error-prone, as the emulsions need to be stored cooled and developed by specialised labs directly after exposing them. Moreover, determining the right exposure is not as straightforward as with conventional/standard (i. e. visible light) photography. Together with some ignorance and/or lack of knowledge about the subject, this critical imaging process severely restricted NIR radiation to be captured by aerial archaeologists so far. However, this changed completely with the advent of digital cameras. As their sensors are very sensitive to NIR radiation, the whole process of taking NIR photographs is much less of a cumber stone. The poster under consideration wants to show how NIR imagery can be taken with normal (and converted) digital cameras, what the images look like, compare the advantages (and disadvantages) to normal aerial imaging (e. g. haze penetration, enhanced clarity of detail and visualization of stressed vegetation) as well as outline a basic approach of NIR image processing...|$|R

We aim to achieve a fundamental understanding of these phenomena by designing experiments that can be used to test and alter modern theory and computational modeling. One example illustrating recent investigations into the details of the ultrafast processes that form the basis for photoinduced charge separation at a molecular/bulk interface relevant to dye-sensitized solar cells is briefly presented here: Kinetics of interfacial PET and charge recombination processes were measured by fs and ns transient spectroscopy in a heterogeneous donor-bridge-acceptor (D-B-A) system, where D is a Ru(II) (terpyridyl-PO 3) (NCS) 3 complex, B an oligo-p-phenylene bridge, and A nanocrystalline TiO 2. The forward ET reaction was found to be faster than vibrational relaxation of the vibronic excited state of the donor. Instead, the back ET occurred on the micros time scale and involved fully thermalized species. The D-A distance dependence of the {{electron transfer}} rate was studied by varying the number of p-phenylene units contained in the bridge moiety. The remarkably low damping factor beta = 0. 16 angstroms(- 1) observed for the ultrafast charge injection from the dye excited state into the conduction band of TiO 2 is attributed to the coupling of electron tunneling with nonequilibrium vibrations redistributed on the bridge, giving rise to polaronic transport of charges from the donor ligand to the acceptor solid oxide surface...|$|R
