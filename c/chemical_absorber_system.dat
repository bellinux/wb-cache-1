40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{performance}} of proposed modified Active Remote Dynamic <b>Absorber</b> (ARDA) <b>systems.</b> The modification is intended to improve the practicability of the previously proposed ARDA technique. The current ARDA concept utilizes an <b>absorber</b> <b>system</b> identical to the primary system (the system whose vibration is to be controlled) and two voltage amplifiers. The modification to the current ARDA system employs one amplifier only and a smaller <b>absorber</b> <b>system.</b> The mathematical model of the modified ARDA systems is developed based on a finite element approach. The developed mathematical model is programmed and solved using Maple. The program is validated by comparing the first two natural frequencies of the uncontrolled primary system (yielded by the program itself) with those engendered by the exact solution of the continuous system, the commercial finite element program ANSYS, and the experimental work. The results of the analyses do not demonstrate a significant improvement over the current ARDA system. For the modified ARDA system to be practical, the system requires a high amplifier gain and a large <b>absorber</b> <b>system.</b> The investigation results suggest that further efforts is needed to explore the feasibility of the modified ARDA system, such as investigating the effects of different materials of the absorber beam {{and the use of}} more advanced sensors or actuators...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} method for {{detecting}} gravitational magnification of distant sources, like quasars, due to <b>absorber</b> <b>systems</b> detected in their spectra. We first motivate the use of metal absorption lines rather than Lyman-alpha lines, then we show how to relate the observed moments of the source magnitude distribution to the mass distribution of absorbers. In order to illustrate the feasibility of the method, we use a simple model to estimate the amplitude of the effect expected for MgII absorption lines, and show that their lensing signal might already be detectable in large surveys like the SDSS. Our model suggests that quasars behind strong MgII absorbers are in average brightened by - 0. 05 to - 0. 2 magnitude due to magnification. One must therefore revisit the claim that, in magnitude limited surveys, quasars with strong absorbers tend to be missed due to extinction effects. In addition to constraining the mass of <b>absorber</b> <b>systems,</b> applying our method will allow for the quantification of this bias. Comment: 21 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Ap...|$|R

The {{vehicle suspension}} system consists of wishbones, the spring and the shock absorber to transmit and also filter all forces between the body and road.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{research into}} two novel techniques {{for improving the}} low frequency performance, tunability and efficiency of membrane absorbers. The first approach uses a loudspeaker surround as the mounting for the membrane, increasing the moving mass, thereby lowering the resonant frequency of the system. Using a loudspeaker surround also allows for more accurate prediction of the absorber’s performance as the mounting conditions are such that the membrane can be more accurately represented by a lumped mass moving as a piston. The second approach expands upon this technique and uses a loudspeaker within a sealed cabinet to act as the membrane absorber. Passive electronic components can be connected across the terminals of the loudspeaker to adapt the mechanical resonance properties of the system. Tests were performed on the <b>absorber</b> <b>systems</b> using a specially constructed low frequency impedance tube. It was found that varying a complex electrical load connected to the driver terminals enabled the range of obtainable resonant frequencies of the system to be dramatically increased. Varying a solely resistive load {{has also been shown}} to alter the absorption bandwidth. An analogue circuit analysis of the <b>absorber</b> <b>system</b> is presented and demonstrates good agreement with impedance tube measurements.

As MgII lines {{can be observed in}} the range 0. 37 < zabs < 2. 2, the absorbing galaxies are in general not identified in SDSS images, but they produce systematic light excesses around QSOs which can be detected with a statistical analysis. In this Letter we present a 6 σ detection of this effect over the whole sample in i-band, rising to 9. 4 σ for a low-redshift subsample with 0. 37 < zabs ≤ 0. 82. We use a control sample of QSOs without strong MgII absorption lines to quantify and remove systematics with typical 10 - 20 % accuracy. The signal varies as expected as a function of absorber redshift. For the low zabs subsample we can reliably estimate the average luminosities per MgII <b>absorber</b> <b>system</b> in the g, r, and i bands and find them to be compatible with a few-hundred-Myr old stellar population of Mr ∼ − 21 in the rest frame.
