40|$|We {{find the}} Casimir-like {{energies}} for strings and membranes. We {{show that the}} related Casimir forces {{can be interpreted as}} quantum corrections to the classical tensions of the strings and membranes.

So we find that the quantum vacuum can break the (tensional) isotropy of the rectangular and <b>cylindrical</b> <b>membranes.</b> Also obtaining the nonzero-temperature Casimir energy, we find relations for the tensions at nonzero temperature.

40|$|The {{applications}} of membranes are increasing rapidly in various fields {{of engineering and}} science. The geometric, material, force and contact non-linearities complicate their analysis, which increases the demand for computationally efficient methods and interpretation of counter-intuitive behaviours. The {{first part of the}} present work studies the free and constrained inflation of circular and <b>cylindrical</b> <b>membranes.</b> The membranes are assumed to be in contact with a soft substrate, modelled as a linear spring distribution. Adhesive and frictionless contact conditions are considered during inflation,while only adhesive contact conditions are considered during deflation. For a circular membrane, peeling of the membrane during deflation is studied, and a numerical formulation of the energy release rate is proposed. The second part of the thesis discusses the instabilities observed for fluid containing <b>cylindrical</b> <b>membranes.</b> Limit points and bifurcation points are observed on primary equilibrium branches. The secondary branches emerge from bifurcation points, with their directions determined by eigenvectors corresponding to zero eigenvalues at the bifurcation point. Symmetry has major implications on stability analysis of the structures, and the relationship between eigenvalue analysis and symmetry is highlighted {{in this part of the}} thesis. In the third part, wrinkling in the pressurized membranes is investigated,and robustness of the modified membrane theory and tension field theory is examined. The effect of boundary conditions, thickness variations, and inflating media on the wrinkling is investigated. It is observed that, with a relaxed strain energy formulation, the obtained equilibrium solutions are unstable due to the occurrence of pressure induced instabilities. A detailed analysis of pressure induced instabilities in the wrinkled membranes is described in the thesis. QC 20160518 </p...|$|R

40|$|We analyze open {{membranes}} {{immersed in}} a magnetic three-form field-strength $C$. While <b>cylindrical</b> <b>membranes</b> {{in the absence of}} $C$ behave like tensionless strings, when the $C$ flux is present the strings polarize into thin membrane ribbons, locally orthogonal to the momentum density, thus providing the strings with an effective tension. The effective dynamics of the ribbons can be described by a simple deformation of the Schild action for null strings. Interactions become non-local due to the polarization, and lead to a deformation of the string field theory, whereby string vertices receive a phase factor proportional to the volume swept out by the ribbons. In a particular limit, this reduces to the non-commutative loop space found previously. Comment: revte...|$|R

More specifically, the influence of transmembrane pressure (Δp) and temperature on flux and separation ability during ultrafiltration combined with continuous diafiltration is investigated. Two different types of membranes were used, a spiral polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) (molecular weight cut-off [MWCO 75 kDa) {{and a set of}} 18 <b>cylindrical</b> PVDF <b>membranes</b> (MWCO 100 kDa).

40|$|The {{hydrogen}} {{chemical potential}} in metallic membranes {{is affected by}} the self-stresses generated by the interstitial transport within the lattice (stress-induced diffusion). This article provides analytical and numerical evidence that, in the presence of stress-induced diffusion, hydrogen transport in thin metallic <b>cylindrical</b> <b>membranes</b> can exhibit macroscopic features qualitatively different from those observed in planar structures. This is a consequence of the different ways diffusion-induced stresses propagate in planar and in the cylindrical structures. We focus on the investigation of the uphill diffusion effect (observed experimentally in Pd and I'd alloy membranes) originally explained {{as a consequence of the}} failure of the Fick law for solid-state diffusion. We show that the classical stress-induced diffusion (SID) model applied to a cylindrical structure leads to a Fickian-type transport equation, which indeed displays the uphill effect solely as a consequence of the non-linear, non-local time-dependent boundary conditions corresponding to permeation experiments.
