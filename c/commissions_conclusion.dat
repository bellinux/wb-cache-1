40|$|Professors Goldberg vigorously {{attacks the}} merits of the Three Tenors {{decision}} while emphasizing the issue of whether the challenged restraint resides within the boundaries of the firm. Professor Muris responds that the Commissions analysis is correct {{as a matter of law}} and fact, and that Professor Goldbergs call for a market power screen for all horizontal restraints ignores the legal costs of rulemaking. I take a third view of the debate. While conceding that per se rule is properly applied to naked restraints, I show that the Commissions analysis relies on an inappropriately narrow view of the ancillary restraints doctrine in order to justify application of the per se rule. In particular, the Commissions emphasis on the timing of the restraint as well as its hostility towards PolyGrams free rider defense are not supported as a matter of law. In any event, the facts of the Three Tenors do not support the <b>Commissions</b> <b>conclusion</b> that the moratorium agreement was not ancillary to the joint venture. ...|$|E

In 1985 he ordered the removal of 100 Mbayá people from his 75,000 hectare landholding in the Alto Paraná Department; he had previously pressured them for ten years to leave their ancestral Paso Romero community, after he had purchased the property. In 2012 the violent removal of occupying farmers from Riquelme's land in the Canindeyú Department sparked the impeachment of Fernando Lugo.

In particular, the late emergence of the knowledge did not provide proof of fabrication and is expected in the case of genuine sacred information, lack of recording in the literature was not inconsistent with the material, that it was inappropriate to assert that a particular spiritual belief was irrational, Wilson's testimony was not reliable and Mileras was a personal belief and not evidence of fabrication.

40|$|Embedded in Burundi’s peace process, the {{creation}} of judicial and nonjudicial transitional justice (TJ) mechanisms promised truth, reconciliation and justice {{to the victims of}} crimes committed during conflict. Yet, an analysis of the dynamics of the localization of TJ reveals multiple subversion techniques mobilized by national and international actors, leading to counterproductive outcomes. This article explores these dynamics and formulates two arguments. First, these subversion techniques are the consequence of a double phenomenon. On the one hand, the conjunction of the normalization of TJ in the postconflict toolbox {{and the nature of the}} internationalization of Burundi’s peace process has made the pursuit of TJ inevitable. On the other, the incompatibilities between TJ and divergent priorities, interests and agendas have made its realization equally impossible. Secondly, this subversion has led to a triple form of (transitional) injustice: a denial of justice through ‘temporary immunities’; an absence of justice through a negotiation process more oriented towards noninception than {{the creation}} of TJ mechanisms; and a risk of biased justice through the modalities and timing of the National Truth and Reconciliation <b>Commission.</b> <b>Conclusions</b> of this article call for a greater questioning of the TJ model promoted and deeper research into the localization dynamics, especially in post peace-settlement contexts. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|Introduction - The Dutch {{implementation}} of the black border provision in the 2001 European Union Tobacco Products Directive (TPD) is studied to examine the implications of tobacco industry involvement in the implementation phase of the policy process. Methods - A qualitative analysis was conducted of Dutch government documents obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests, triangulated with in-depth interviews with key informants and secondary data sources (publicly available government documents, scientific literature, and news articles). Results - Tobacco manufacturers’ associations were {{given the opportunity to}} set implementation specifications via a fast-track deal with the government. The offer of early {{implementation of}} the labelling section of the TPD was used as political leverage by the industry, and underpinned by threats of litigation and arguments highlighting the risks of additional public costs and the benefits to the government of expediency and speed. Ultimately, the government agreed to the industry's interpretation, against the advice of the European <b>Commission.</b> <b>Conclusions</b> - The findings highlight the policy risks associated with corporate actors’ ability to use interactions over technical product specifications to influence the implementation of health policy and illustrate the difficulties in limiting industry interference in accordance with Article 5. 3 of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). The implementation phase is particularly vulnerable to industry influence, where negotiation with industry actors may be unavoidable and the practical implications of relatively technical considerations are not always apparent to policymakers. During the {{implementation of the}} new TPD 2014 / 40 /EU, government officials are advised to take a proactive role in stipulating technical specifications...|$|R

40|$|In the U. S. federal system, “crisis commissions” are {{powerful}} instruments of social learning that actively mediate {{the politics of}} disaster and reform. Typically endowed with the legal authority to establish causes of dramatic policy failures and make recommendations to prevent their recurrence, commissions can prompt major governmental reorganizations. Yet commissions are also frequently accused of being influenced by dominant interests and faulted for articulating incomplete or politically expedient narratives of failure. Even when <b>commission</b> <b>conclusions</b> are accepted, the reforms they propose are not always adopted. Using the 9 / 11 Commission as a conceptual backdrop, this dissertation explores the relationship between disaster, public investigation, and reform by undertaking a detailed study of the Space Shuttle Columbia Accident Investigation Board and Iraq Study Group. Together, the cases constitute {{a study of the}} national security state seeking to correct failures across different domains of state power: border security, war-making capability, and dominance in space. I argue that commissions, as one-shot diagnostic and therapeutic instruments, are more effective than standing political institutions at confronting entrenched ways of seeing and knowing in complex systems of the national security state, which are defined by the interaction of ideology, large bureaucracies, and advanced technologies. The ability of commissions to see critically for society itself is not given but rather constructed through investigative and deliberative processes that must overcome the action of political interests. Commission credibility is therefore not an essential trait that derives a priori from the inherent stature of its members, but is rather the output of the investigative phase as commissions identify, compile, and publicize errors made by the state. In this adversarial process, an aggressive professional staff emerges as a determinant of commission success, leading to an important distinction between investigative commissions with “super staffs” and advisory commissions that lack them. Process tracing recommendations over a multi-year period nevertheless reveals dynamics of agency and resistance at play between commissions and the institutions they attempt to reform, highlighting the partial success commissions are likely to achieve at coercing entrenched institutions to implement their recommendations.
