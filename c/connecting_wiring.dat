50|$|Resistors above about 1 ohm {{in value}} can be {{measured}} {{using a variety of}} techniques, such as an ohmmeter or by using a Wheatstone Bridge. In such resistors, the resistance of the <b>connecting</b> <b>wires</b> or terminals is negligible compared to the resistance value. For resistors of less than an ohm, the resistance of the <b>connecting</b> <b>wires</b> or terminals becomes significant, and conventional measurement techniques will include them in the result.|$|R

5000|$|The loctal tube's {{structure}} was supported {{directly by the}} connecting pins passing through the glass [...] "button" [...] base. Octal tube structures were supported on a glass [...] "pinch", formed by heating {{the bottom of the}} envelope to fusing temperature, then squeezing the pinch closed. Sealing the pinch embedded the <b>connecting</b> <b>wires</b> in the pinch's glass and gave a vacuum-tight seal. The <b>connecting</b> <b>wires</b> then passed through the hollow base pins, where they were soldered to make permanent connections.|$|R

50|$|Terminal blocks (also called {{terminal}} boards or strips) provide a convenient means of <b>connecting</b> individual electrical <b>wires</b> without a splice or physically joining the ends. They are usually used to <b>connect</b> <b>wiring</b> among various items of equipment within an enclosure {{or to make}} connections among individually enclosed items. Since terminal blocks are readily available {{for a wide range}} of wire sizes and terminal quantity, they are one of the most flexible types of electrical connector available. Some disadvantages are that <b>connecting</b> <b>wires</b> is more difficult than simply plugging in a cable and the terminals are generally not very well protected from contact with persons or foreign conducting materials.|$|R
