50|$|This service {{provides}} a way of learning about and understanding the world - best {{thought of as a}} form of citizenship education. It is not religious or political, but is centrally concerned with our shared humanity. At the core of humanitarian action and thinking is a desire to <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>saving</b> lives and reducing suffering. Humanitarian education invites exploration of those actions and thoughts. Humanitarian Education helps students examine what motivates people, including themselves, and extends to other societies, times and cultures. It explores the wider issues, sometimes surprisingly complex, that arise when people help each other.|$|E

50|$|The German Labour Delegation {{published}} the Neue Volkszeitung, {{which was at}} first a daily, then later a weekly newspaper. The organisation {{did not have a}} large membership. Its members were those who in the Weimar Republic had generally belonged to {{the right wing of the}} SPD. The organisation was therefore strongly against any cooperation with the Communist Party of Germany, the KPD. However, its effectiveness was also constrained by internal conflicts. Amongst these were the dispute over Grzesinski's work in the Council for a Democratic Germany, which saw itself as a gathering point for all the German emigrants, including members of the KPD. There was also very little success in securing financial donations. The GLD was only able to maintain an office with the support of the Jewish Labor Committee. However, the GLD did manage to <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>saving</b> several hundred endangered Social Democrats from arrest by the German authorities and getting them out of France in 1940. The GLD also worked on developing plans for the reconstruction of the workers' movement and the introduction of democratic structures in post-Nazi Germany. Due to its small size and its activities in planning, the organization is sometimes seen by scholars as a research institution.|$|E

The percent reduction in the average age-adjusted rate of PYLL due to uterine cancer and the years of life saved per 100, 000 females were greater in the high coverage-rate areas than in the control areas.

40|$|The critiquing-based {{recommender}} system mainly aims to guide users {{to make an}} accurate and confident decision, while requiring them to consume {{a low level of}} effort.

Current financial support for the Universal Service Fund is problematic in that only telecommunications carriers providing interstate services are required to contribute to the fund. The author maintains that the contribution base should be expanded to include companies providing broadband internet access. With its preexisting mandate to bring telecommunications services to underserved communities in rural areas, the Universal Service Fund is a logical conduit for funding of broadband deployment. Such deployment could ultimately have a significant positive effect on both the local and national economies, and improve access to education, healthcare, and public safety...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a couple of}} new truss structures based on fractal geometry. One is the famous Sierpinski Gasket and another is a fractal triangle derived by means of applying a process forming leaves of a cedar tree using M. F. Barnsley’s contraction mapping theory. Therefore a pair of x-y coordinates of an arbitrary nodal point on the structures are generated easily if IFS(Iterated Function System) codes and a scale of them are specified. Structural members are defined similarly. Thus data for frame analysis can be generated automatically, which is significant if the objective structure has complex configuration. Next analytical results under vertical and wind loadings in Japanese Building Code are shown. Here members {{are assumed to be}} timber and to have cross section of 15 cm× 15 cm. Finally authors conclude that geometrically new truss structures were developed and automatic data generation for frame analysis was attained using IFS.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simultaneous engineering and rapid prototyping approach that {{was applied to}} conceptualise an ergonomic in-vehicle HMI of an advanced driver information system. Computer simulations of the human machine interface (HMI) and simple representation of a driving task were applied to conceptualise the HMI in {{an early stage of}} the project. To face the challenge of a user and safety oriented design of the HMI for this type of system, the approach was chosen to develop an ergonomic HMI of an in-vehicle information system in parallel with the other sub-systems. Different interaction concepts were selected and implemented according to boundary conditions and technical developments in the project and then realised as virtual prototypes. In summary it can be stated that the prototyping approach using driving scenarios as well as computer demonstration/simulation of the HMI has proven to be useful for the conceptualisation of in-vehicles HMI. It has to be mentioned that user tests performed with virtual prototypes lead to applicable results and can <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>saving</b> costs and time in the development process...|$|E

40|$|Human {{rights are}} {{a central part}} of a social worker’s value base in {{contemporary}} practice, but the structures by which social work services are delivered can adversely affect practitioners’ abilities to uphold service user rights. This article describes the organisational development of social work services in England and the evolution of a rights focus for the practice of social work. It uses two cases, participation by children and young people looked after by the local authority and parents with learning difficulties, to determine what prevents the delivery of rights at practice level. We argue that the structures which are the product of historical development prevent workers delivering a service that is anti-oppressive and grounded in a rights based approach to practice. This suggests that the recent changed arrangements for the delivery of social work offer the opportunity to address human rights within practice and reinvigorate the profession. The division of the profession between children’s trusts and adult social services within separate local authority departments or care trusts should make dialogue between specialist social workers, which has been suppressed by internal structures, possible. Such a dialogue could <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>saving</b> the profession from the disintegration that its division threatens, while advancing the human rights agenda...|$|E
