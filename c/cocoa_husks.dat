40|$|Increasing yield {{is one of}} {{the goals}} in the tropics. Traditional farming is {{replaced}} in many cases by agroindustrial production which often leads to environmental pollution due to the marked use of pesticides and fertilizers. In Tabasco, Amashito pepper (Capsicum annum var. glabriusculcum) is cultivated in the traditional way in backyards or cocoa fields with no chemical inputs. The germination of these kind of peppers is difficult to achieve, since wild peppers seeds have a large range of dormancy. Plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPRs) are used as inoculants for biofertilization, phytostimulation and biocontrol. Soil fauna has an important function in regulating rhizosphere microbial processes and therefore significantly affects plant growth. Earthworms produce indirect effects through changes in the environment of the roots or via interactions with organisms that affect root growth and production. Our aim was to study the effects of different fresh organic matter, earthworms (P. corethrurus, oligochaeta) and rhizobacteria (A. brasiliensis) on plant growth, and yield production of amashito pepper (Capsicum annuum var. glabriusculum). We established a three factorial outdoors mesocosms experiment.

A cocoa product rich in cocoa fiber (CP) has been produced from <b>cocoa</b> <b>husks</b> and this study assessed whether its regular consumption may be a strategy to improve lipid profile, serum glucose and antioxidant activity as well as blood pressure in moderately hypercholesterolemic subjects. Methods: In this free-living, non-controlled, non-randomized, two-month-long, open intervention trial. 21 volunteers consumed daily two servings of CP, which provided 12 g of dietary fiber and 283 mg of soluble polyphenols. Subjects were moderately hypercholesterolemic (> 200 mg dl - 1), non-vegetarian, non-smoker, women and men between 18 and 45 years old, with a body mass index under 30 kg m - 2, not suffering from any other chronic pathology. Blood samples were drawn and anthropometric measurements, systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures were evaluated at the baseline, and at weeks 2, 4, and 8. Serum lipids, creatinine, uric acid, glucose, C-reactive protein, ferric reducing/antioxidant power and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were analyzed. Results: Glucose (p = 0. 019), SBP (p = 0. 001), DBP (p = 0. 001) and MDA (p = 0. 036) decreased, HDL-cholesterol slightly increased, whereas the rest of the parameters remained similar. Conclusions: This preliminary study suggests that CP might be considered part of a dietary approach or a functional food or ingredient for the food industry to achieve hypotensive and hypoglycemic effects in moderately hypercholesterolemic subjects without inducing changes in body weight and waist circumference, although results should be confirmed in a longer, controlled human study. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012.

The earth bricks were moulded with different percentages of <b>Cocoa</b> Pod <b>Husk</b> Ash consisting of 0 %, 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 % and 25 %. Using a mould dimension of 200 mm x 100 mm x 75 mm, earth bricks were manually casted and cured for 28 days. Data results showed remarkable improvement in all the properties studied on the earth bricks but varied depending on the ash content. The study also revealed that <b>cocoa</b> pod <b>husk</b> ash {{can be used as a}} stabilizer in the production of earth bricks especially when the <b>Cocoa</b> pod <b>husk</b> ash content is 10 % by weight as higher ash contents slightly decline the engineering properties...|$|R
40|$|Worldwide, {{composting}} {{is increasingly}} becoming a popular option as an environmentally sustainable {{method of recycling}} agricultural and municipal wastes. Yet, in Ireland, this technology has not been applied to large volume wastes (pig slurry, spent mushroom compost, <b>cocoa</b> <b>husks,</b> sawdust, shredded paper and poultry litter) for their profitable conversion to economically viable 'green' fertilizers. Our preliminary work describes the technology to separate pig slurry solids and the subsequent incomplete (90 -day) co-composting with locally available agricultural wastes as absorbent materials. An estimated yield of 2. 6 tonnes fresh solids per 100 m of slurry separated was obtained assuming the separator had a throughput of 20 m h using `perforated rotary drum separator' equipment. During composting carbonaceous material is mineralized {{as evidenced by the}} declining C/N ratios in all the 4 batches over time. Concurrently, trends of increasing ash, Ec and bulk density further indicate composting is proceeding albeit slowly in batches 6, 7 and 9. The marked decline in pH from 8. 88 to 6. 69 and ammonia 0. 37 % to 0. 005 % in batch 5 indicate a more advanced decomposition during the same 90 -day period. The preliminary results may further suggest that by facilitating better control of environmental parameters the `in vessel' process will result in more efficient composting ultimately producing a more uniform substrate. Pathogen screening of undifferentiated pig slurry indicated that 58 % of samples contained Salmonella species and 21 % contained Campylobacter species. The presence of oocysts of Cryptosporidium was also detected but the absence of Shigella, E. coli 0157 and Yersinia species were confirmed. Temperature maxima of 61 [...] 68 C were achieved during the initial 90 -day co-com [...] ...|$|E
30|$|Insufficient waste {{management}} {{has led to}} growing interests in approaches to safe emptying, transport, and disposal of faecal sludge (FS) (Strauss and Montangero 2002). Numerous technical developments have attempted {{to address the problems}} of emptying, transporting, and disposal of FS from urban centres (Boot and Scott 2008). Currently, the focus of research is shifting from FS disposal to reuse, with fertilizer and soil conditioner being among the most common reuse options. FS, like animal manure, is a good soil conditioner and a renewable source of plant nutrients, such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) (Cofie et al. 2004), and organic matter. These are lacking in arable soils found in the tropics. There is, therefore, need to transform this valuable waste into useful soil amendments for crop production. This will represent an important option for both sustainable {{waste management}} and sustainable agriculture (Chang and Davila 2007; Dick and McCoy 1993). Although FS contains these beneficial resources that can be applied to arable soils, the raw sludge contains high pathogen concentrations and direct use without prior treatment puts both farmers and consumers at risks. Composting is one way to sanitize dewatered FS (DFS). On its own, there is too little organic content to achieve thermophilic conditions (i.e., temperatures above 55  °C) during composting, which is necessary for complete pathogen destruction. Co-composting with carbon-rich materials, such as oil palm empty fruit bunches (EFB) and cocoa pod husks (CPH), can impart two key benefits: (a) enabling of thermophilic temperatures and (b) prevention of nitrogen volatilization (Jeong and Kim 2001). Previous composting studies in Ghana experimented with co-composting DFS with municipal solid wastes and sawdust (Kone et al. 2007; Cofie et al. 2009). The use of other agricultural wastes, such as EFB and CPH, has received very little research attention in terms of co-composting with DFS. It is estimated that approximately 400, 000 tonnes of cocoa beans are produced annually (Ofosu-Budu et al. 2001, personal communication), and based on this annual production, an estimated 550, 750 tonnes of dry <b>cocoa</b> <b>husks</b> are produced (Adamtey 2005). Annual production of EFB in Ghana can be estimated based on annual production of approximately 3, 135, 000 tonnes of fresh oil palm fruit bunches (calculation based on average yield of 11 tonnes per hectare) (Toledano et al. 2004). Agro-industrial wastes are posing serious challenges for the agro-industries (Abu Qdais and Al-Widyan 2016). Similarly, an estimated amount of about 3.5 million tonnes of human excreta is produced in Ghana based on an average production of 400  g cap− 1  day− 1 (Mann 1976). This leaves a lot of human and agricultural wastes in the environment, which are traditionally directly incinerated or deposited in landfills resulting in the production of significant amounts of greenhouse gases (Zhang et al. 2013) or sometimes reapplied to land as a conditioner and could pose health and environmental risks. Many studies have reported that organic wastes composts, such as from sewage sludge (Perez-Murcia et al. 2006), municipal solid waste (Ostos et al. 2008), animal manure (Atiyeh et al. 2001; Eklind et al. 2001), green waste (Grigatti et al. 2007; Ribeiro et al. 2007), and agro-industrial waste (Papafotiou et al. 2004; Bustamante et al. 2008) can be used with very good results as growth medium instead of peat (Kala et al. 2012). These composts and other solid manures are great, but they have one major disadvantage of taking a longer time to breakdown in the soil to release nutrients. Therefore, for successful growing of vegetables and other horticultural crops, such as tomato, which require rapid nitrogen sources, the use of compost tea could play a significant role. Compost tea has evolved from historical horticultural practices, such as steeping manure or plants in water, with the liquid applied to crops for nutritional and plant health reasons. In recent decades, the majority of published studies examining compost tea have focussed on foliar plant disease suppression using liquid materials produced by steeping compost in water for several days to weeks (Scheuerell 2004). It is increasingly being used as an alternative plant disease control measure in commercial horticulture (Diver 2001; Scheuerell and Mahaffee 2002). Compared to the numerous reports on the use of compost tea for managing foliar diseases, little work has been done to assess the nutritional benefits of compost tea on plant growth (Pant 2009). Studies into the nutritional effect of compost tea on horticultural plants are, therefore, necessary. As a liquid fertilizer, its high nutrient value and rapid availability make it a great tonic for the plants. This study, therefore, aims at (i) co-composting DFS, EFB, and CPH at different formulations to determine the appropriate formulation that will produce safe compost for use in soilless medium for tomato transplant production and (ii) to assess the nutritional effect of compost tea brewed from the FS-based compost on the vegetative growth of tomato.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the study carried out during 2004 - 2007 was to evaluate the in-fluence of three types of substrates (peat, sawdust and <b>cocoa</b> <b>husk)</b> on yield, quality and chemical composition of highbush blueberries cv. ‘Sierra’. On 4 -year average, the lowest yield per a bush (0. 89 kg) was obtained from bushes grown in <b>cocoa</b> <b>husk</b> substrate and these berries had the lowest weight of 100 fruit (64 g) and were the smallest. On the other hand, they had the highest firmness, measured both vertically (512 G mm- 1) and horizontally (275 G mm- 1). The highest soluble solids content (14. 45 %) and titratable acidity (1. 02 g of citric acid equivalents 100 g- 1) were found in fruit harvested from bushes growing in peat. The substrates did not affect significantly total sugar (11. 98 - 12. 30 g 100 g- 1) and vitamin C contents (26. 0 - 27. 9 mg 100 g- 1). The nitrates content in blueberries was low, ranging from 17. 5 (peat) to 34. 7 mg kg- 1 (sawdust) whereas the content of nitrites varied from 0. 85 (peat) to 1. 10 mg kg- 1 (sawdust). Blueberries obtained from peat- and cocoa husk-bedded bushes had significantly higher total phenolics content (231. 03 mg and 222. 29 mg per 100 g- 1, respectively) compared to these grown in sawdust (181. 74 mg 100 g- 1). Similarly, the berries originating from peat- and cocoa husk-grown plants showed higher total anthocyanin content (144. 55 mg 100 g- 1 and 146. 73 mg 100 g- 1, respectively) than fruit collected from sawdust-bedded bushes (120. 92 mg 100 g- 1). Taking into account the yield alone, the best effects were obtained from ‘Sierra’ bushes grown in sawdust. However, regarding chemical composition, the berries from bushes grown in peat and <b>cocoa</b> <b>husk</b> were richest in nutritional components and, especially, in phenolic compounds...|$|R
