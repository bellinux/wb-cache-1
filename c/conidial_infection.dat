40|$|Aspergillosis is {{the most}} common fungal disease of the avian {{respiratory}} tract and is caused primarily by Aspergillus fumigatus. The respiratory macrophages provide important defence against aspergillosis. T- 2 toxin (T- 2), a trichothecene mycotoxin produced by Fusarium spp. in improperly stored agricultural products, has immunomodulatory effects. We studied the impact of T- 2 on the antifungal response of the chicken macrophage cell line HD- 11 against A. fumigatus infection. The macrophages were first exposed to 0. 5 to 10 ng/ml T- 2 for 24 h, and then their viability, antifungal activity, and cytokine expression in response to A. fumigatus <b>conidial</b> <b>infection</b> were determined. The viability of macrophages decreased when exposed to T- 2 at concentrations higher than 1 ng/ml. One hour after <b>conidial</b> <b>infection,</b> phagocytosed conidia were observed in 30 % of the non-T- 2 -exposed macrophages, but in only 5 % of the macrophages exposed to 5 ng/ml T- 2. Seven hours after infection, 24 % of the conidia associated with non-T- 2 -exposed macrophages germinated, in contrast to 75 % of those with macrophages exposed to 5 ng/ml T- 2. A. fumigatus infection induced upregulation of interleukin (IL) - 1 β, CXCLi 1, CXCLi 2 and IL- 12 β, and downregulation of transforming growth factor-β 4 in macrophages. Exposure of A. fumigatus-infected macrophages to T- 2 at 1 to 5 ng/ml further upregulated the expression of IL- 1 β, IL- 6, CCLi 2, CXCLi 1, CXCLi 2, IL- 18 (at 1 and 2 ng/ml) and IL- 12 β, and further downregulated that of transforming growth factor-β 4 (at 5 ng/ml). In conclusion, T- 2 impaired the antifungal activities of chicken macrophages against A. fumigatus conidia, but might stimulate immune response by upregulating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and T-helper 1 cytokines...|$|E
40|$|Fusicladium eriobotryae (Cav.) Sacc. is {{the causal}} agent of loquat scab, {{which is the}} main disease {{affecting}} loquat (Eriobotrya japonica Lindl.) in the Mediterranean basin. F. eriobotryae infects leaves, shoots and fruits; scabby fruits are unsuitable for the market, resulting in significant economic losses. To predict the infection of loquat fruits, a mechanistic, weather-driven, disease model has been developed. By simulating <b>conidial</b> <b>infection</b> processes following a rain event, the model estimates the percentage of conidia that successfully infected loquat fruits {{at the end of}} an infection period; input data are hourly values of air temperature, rainfall, relative humidity and leaf wetness. The model is mainly derived from equations developed from recent in vitro and plant experimental results. Three data sets have been used to validate the model: (1) percentage of affected fruit in an unsprayed loquat orchard during two growing seasons (2011 and 2012); (2) infection occurrence in an unsprayed loquat orchard during 2013; and (3) expert appreciation of disease level on seven loquat growing seasons (expert elicitation). Results from this validation showed that the model is able to predict the infection periods and the development of the disease. The model could be used to improve the timing of fungicide sprays, thus reducing the number of applications...|$|E

40|$|A mechanistic, {{dynamic model}} was {{developed}} to predict infection of loquat fruit by conidia of Fusicladium eriobotryae, the causal agent of loquat scab. The model simulates scab infection periods and their severity through the sub-processes of spore dispersal, infection, and latency (i. e., the state variables); change from one state to the following one depends on environmental conditions and on processes described by mathematical equations. Equations were developed using published data on F. eriobotryae mycelium growth, <b>conidial</b> germination, <b>infection,</b> and <b>conidial</b> dispersion pattern. The model was then validated by comparing model output with three independent data sets. The model accurately predicts the occurrence and severity of infection periods {{as well as the}} progress of loquat scab incidence on fruit (with concordance correlation coefficients > 0. 95).

40|$|Aspergillus fumigatus is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} airborne fungal pathogen and causes fatal invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients. Given the essential role of dendritic cells (DC) in initiating and regulating immune responses, we investigated the impact of A. fumigatus <b>conidial</b> <b>infection</b> on human DC. A. fumigatus conidia were rapidly internalized and induced the release of tumor necrosis factor alpha within the first 8 h. After A. fumigatus infection, the majority of DC underwent full maturation, although CCR 7 expression was observed only in DC that had internalized the conidia. Additionally, the analysis of regulatory cytokines showed that infected DC simultaneously produced interleukin- 12 p 70 (IL- 12 p 70) and significant amounts of IL- 10. IL- 10 neutralization {{was not able to}} further increase IL- 12 p 70 production from infected DC. Whereas the central role of IL- 12 in the generation of Th 1 cells has long been appreciated, recently two other members of the IL- 12 family, IL- 23 and IL- 27, were reported to play important roles in the regulation of gamma interferon (IFN-γ) production from naïve and memory T cells. A. fumigatus-infected DC were also able to express high levels of IL- 23 p 19 and low levels of IL- 27 p 28 at later stages of infection. According to this expression pattern, A. fumigatus-infected DC were able to prime IFN-γ production of naïve T cells.

40|$|The {{last two}} years we {{measured}} the amounts of leaf litter and ascospore production per unit of leaf litter area in 7 organic pear orchards throughout the Netherlands. In one of the orchards, adapted managements strategies were implemented two years ago, being grass/clover that is grown as ground cover on the tree-strip, and organic cattle-manure that replaces chicken manure pellets, in order to stimulate the earthworm population and change the palatability of the leaf litter. First results indicate large differences between orchards in percentage of ground covered by dead leaves {{at the time of}} major ascospore infections, but also in number of ascospores per cm 2 leaf litter and in resulting potential ascospore dose. We used these data, together with weather data (temperature, rainfall), in a simple multivariate analysis to gain insight in the dynamics of the system. In 2010, 85 % of the variation in pear scab was explained with a model with rainfall during summer and the amount of asco sores per unit of leaf area. In 2011, 81 % of the variation was explained by a model with the amounts of ascospores per unit leaf area and the potential ascospore dose. In the adapted management experiment we measured no changes in leaf litter in the treatments yet. We discuss that our first results show that, to a limited degree, leaf litter was indeed important for the scab epidemic in 2011, whereas in 2010 the high amount of rainfall {{in the second part of}} the growing season must have led to a high <b>conidial</b> <b>infection</b> pressure. Surprisingly, in both years ascospore number per unit leaf area was of more importance than leaf litter area or potential ascospore dose.

The fungus Aspergillus fumigatus is {{a leading cause of}} infectious death in the rapidly expanding immunocompromised patient population. Current antifungal treatments for invasive aspergillosis are often ineffective, and novel therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. We demon-strate that a mutant of A. fumigatus lacking the calcineurin A (cnaA) catalytic subunit exhibited defective hyphal morphology related to apical extension and polarized growth, which resulted in drastically decreased filamentation. The cnaA mutant lacked the extensive lattice of invading hyphae seen with the wild-type and complemented strains.

40|$|Leptosphaeria maculans and L. biglobosa cause {{stem canker}} and dry rot disease on {{brassica}} crops. Although {{the disease has}} been reported to be present in New Zealand brassica cropping areas a comprehensive assessment of the causal agent and epidemiology has not been carried out. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the causal agent(s) and to investigate the epidemiology under New Zealand conditions. Sampling of the disease tissue characteristic to stem canker/dry rot collected from different regions revealed that both Leptosphaeria maculans and L. biglobosa are present. Leptosphaeria maculans was the predominant species accounting for 97 % (n= 127) of the colonies recovered with the remaining 3 % (n= 4) identified as L. biglobosa. Initial species identification based on colony morphology was confirmed using molecular methods (species-specific PCR and sequencing). Leptosphaeria maculans was recovered from both symptomatic oilseed rape (OSR) and swede plants. Determination of the mating type ratio from 39 representative isolates of L. maculans showed that the population deviated from the expected 1 : 1 mating type ratio, being 5 : 1 ratio (MAT 1 - 1 :MAT 1 - 2), with differences between regions. The previously sequenced avirulence alleles Avr 1, Avr 6, and Avr 4 - 7 were present in the L. maculans with Avr 6 being the most common and amplified from all 39 isolates. The most common allele structure was a single Avr 6 (n= 20), followed by multiple avirulence alleles Avr 1, 6 (n= 3), Avr 1, Avr 6, 4 - 7 (n= 12), and Avr 4 - 7, 6 (n= 4). Pathogenicity tests using conidial suspensions of different L. maculans isolates showed that this species is pathogenic on both OSR and swede, with no correlation between pathogenicity and crop origin observed. Leaf lesions which developed on the L. maculans inoculated seedlings were characteristic of the reported symptoms being pale grey lesions with abundant pycnidia. Leptosphaeria maculans progressed systemically from the leaf lesions into the petiole and the adjoining stem to cause stem lesions. Stem lesions were first observed 42 day-post inoculation (dpi) on OSR and swede in the greenhouse experiments. The systemic progression was verified by isolation of the pathogen from the symptomless petiole and stem of inoculated plants, and also from the observation of fungal hyphae in the same tissue under fluorescent microscopy. At 65 dpi, some of the inoculated OSR and swede plants were killed. Swede was more susceptible than OSR, regardless of the tolerance ranking of cultivars. Mating type did not influence disease development in either OSR or swede. Although L. biglobosa was also pathogenic on OSR and swede, developing characteristic leaf lesions, stem/tuber lesions did not develop on inoculated plants after 65 dpi. Stem cankers developed both from systemic infection following leaf inoculation and also from direct conidial inoculation of the stem at the six-leaf stage for both swede and OSR. Symptom expression resulting from direct infection was more severe on swede compared to OSR. Mature leaves of seven month old swede plants were not susceptible to either ascospore or <b>conidial</b> <b>infection</b> and dry rot symptoms did not develop on the bulbs indicating no systemic progression. Direct inoculation of mature swede bulbs with either ascospores or conidia resulted in the development of dry rot symptoms. Symptoms developed four weeks earlier with ascospore inoculation compared with conidia. Spore trapping conducted in 2012 - 2013 using a 7 -day Burkard and Rotorod spore sampler trapped ascospores of L. maculans/L. biglobosa in the field. Ascospores of both species were confirmed by nested-PCR using species-specific primers of the DNA extracted from the melinex tape, and showed that ascospores from both species were released concurrently. In field experiments, the effects of different stubble management practices on disease development in OSR were studied in two years. In 2012, there was no significant difference (P= 0. 844) in the disease incidence between stubble treatments (in direct drill, slashing and disking plots) and was probably due to cross-contamination by ascospores between plots. In 2013, the disease incidence in the direct drill treatment (72. 7 %) was significantly higher than in the ploughing (39. 3 %) and disking treated plots (36. 0 %). Results showed that the development of stem canker in the field resulted from systemic progression, with the timing of leaf lesion development coinciding with the timing of ascospore release. Systemic progression was verified by isolation of L. maculans from the symptomless petiole and stem of the plants which developed leaf lesions. The effect of the combination of burial and treatment of the OSR stubble with 5 % urea on the development of pseudothecia was studied. The results showed that burial stimulated stubble degradation, with urea having no significant effect (P= 0. 234) on stubble weight. The combination of urea and burial reduced pseudothecial development with no fruiting bodies recovered from the stubble after 17 weeks. Both bacterial and fungal diversity assessed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) differed across assessment times. The burial treatment affected the carbon utilisation profile, analysed using the MicroRespTM system, of the soil microbial community associated with the stubble at the April (8 weeks) assessment, but urea application had not effect. Overall findings from this study showed that both ascospores and conidia of L. maculans were able to cause stem canker/dry rot disease. The disease was initiated by ascospores in the field with the high risk period of ascospore release between May-August. The disease can be reduced by targeting and eliminating the overwintering inoculum and hence primary spore production. From this study, a combination of 5 % urea application and burial of the stubble after harvest was indicated as a method to reduce inoculum carry over...|$|E

To investigate the role of SNARE proteins in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, MoSec 22, an ortholog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae SNARE protein Sec 22, was identified and the MoSEC 22 gene disrupted. MoSec 22 restored a S. cerevisiae sec 22 mutant in resistance to cell wall perturbing agents, and the DMosec 22 mutant also exhibited defects in mycelial growth, <b>conidial</b> production, and <b>infection</b> of the host plant. Treatment with oxidative stress inducers indicated a breach in cell wall integrity, and staining and quantification assays suggested abnormal chitin deposition on the lateral walls of hyphae of the DMosec 22 mutant.

40|$|Conidia are {{specialized}} structures {{produced at}} the end of the asexual life cycle of most filamentous fungi. They are responsible for fungal dispersal and environmental persistence. In pathogenic species, they are also involved in host recognition and <b>infection.</b> <b>Conidial</b> production, survival, dispersal, germination, pathogenicity and virulence can be strongly influenced by exposure to solar radiation, although its effects are diverse and often species dependent. UV radiation is the most harmful and mutagenic waveband of the solar spectrum. Direct exposure to solar radiation for a few hours can kill conidia of most fungal species. Conidia are killed both by solar UV-A and UV-B radiation. In addition to killing conidia, which limits the size of the fungal population and its dispersion, exposures to sublethal doses of UV radiation can reduce conidial germination speed and virulence. The focus of this review is to provide an overview of the effects of solar radiation on conidia and on the major systems involved in protection from and repair of damage induced by solar UV radiation. The efforts that have been made to obtain strains of fungi of interest such as entomopathogens more tolerant to solar radiation will also be reviewed...|$|R
40|$|Grapevine powdery mildew, {{caused by}} Erysiphe necator, is a {{cosmopolitan}} pathogen that threatens grape production worldwide. Accurate disease forecasts would enhance disease management, particularly where severity varies substantially between years, {{such as in}} New York State. Ascospore release occurred before local bud break of Vitis vinifera in NY, WA, NC and NJ, and was quantitatively related to accumulation of degree days and rain events during overwintering. Acute cold temperature events (< 8 °C) induced transient resistance in V. vinifera to E. necator that lasted for 24 to 36 h and reduced infection efficiency and colony development. Acute cold temperatures also damaged existing colonies, with the highest observed levels of mortality occurring in 3 -day-old colonies. Occurrence of cold events as defined above was documented for many viticultural areas of the United States, Europe, and Australia. With respect to leaf surface temperatures, acute cold events probably occur more frequently than indicated in historical data bases of air temperature due to radiational cooling of the leaf surface during clear, calm nights, e. g., grape leaf surfaces in a Geneva, NY research vineyard were 0. 9 to 6. 6 degrees cooler than the air on clear nights. A regression model was developed from 23 years of historical weather and disease data to forecast fruit disease severity on unsprayed vines using the previous autumn's heat accumulation and pan evaporation (Epan) rates (or Epan estimated from evapotranspiration [Eto]) from 2 wks pre- to 6 wks post-bloom; timeframes relevant to production of (i) cleistothecia capable of surviving winter, and (ii) <b>conidial</b> availability for <b>infection</b> of susceptible berries. Monte Carlo simulation coupled historical and forecasted weather data to predict a likely range of future Eto values, which were then used to predict favorability for disease.

Cumulative ascospore productivity, monitored in the plantation with vaseline coated slide traps and an ascospore liberation tunnel and in controlled temperature cabinets with the ascospore liberation tunnel, was related to degree days base 0 C. A Gompit transformation linearized cumulative ascospore productivity-degree day curves. Utilization of historic degree day data and the equation developed from controlled temperature chambers allowed prediction of seasonal ascospore productivity;Conidia of Septoria musiva were collected from overwintered pycnidia in April. Conidia produced from infected foliage during the growing season generally increased on a weekly basis starting in June. Vaseline coated slide traps collected most conidia in weeks with low levels of rain, while a water collection spore trap monitored highest conidial levels in periods with high rain fall;Foliar infection of a susceptible clone was found whenever measurable levels of conidia or ascospores were collected. Foliar infection ratings were highly correlated with ascospore densities while correlations with conidial densities were generally nonsignificant. Stem infection of a susceptible clone (NC 5272) occurred in periods of peak ascospore and conidial release while a moderately resistant clone (NC 5271) was infected only during peak periods of ascospore collection. Environmental parameters monitored in the field were highly correlated with foliar and stem infection and were used to develop regression equations. In laboratory experiments, both foliage and stems were infected after a four-hour post inoculation wetness period;Bottoms of leaves were more susceptible to infection than tops of leaves of both clones.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{incidence of}} fruit rot, caused by Didymella bryoniae, in glasshouse cucumbers in the Netherlands {{gave rise to}} a study of the biology of the pathogen, the epidemiology of the disease, and control methods. Stems, leaves and growing tips may be attacked, and fruits may be infected internally as well as externally. Internal infection of fruits starts at the blossom end and is initially hard to observe externally. With external fruit rot, lesions occur on any place of the fruit, predominantly in the post harvest period. The survival of the fungus outdoors and in glasshouses was studied. Outdoors, the fungus was able to survive winters with 14 days of frost. A temperature above 5 °C was needed for growth and fructification of the fungus. Diseased plant residues remained an infection source {{as long as they were}} not decomposed. Deliberate introduction of diseased plant debris in the glasshouse caused an earlier appearance of symptoms, and increased the severity of the disease. Hygienic measures are advised to eliminate infection sources. The number of daily trapped ascospores showed a peak after sunset, both outdoors near diseased plant debris and in glasshouses with diseased plants. Watering the plants in the glasshouse favoured ascospore release. Under controlled environmental conditions, ascospores were not released at a high relative humidity or after a change in relative humidity. They could only be trapped after wetting of the substrate. The first ascospores in glasshouses were trapped at about the same time the first symptoms on the plants appeared. Wounding was essential to achieve external fruit rot. The degree of rot was increased by more severe wounding. The rotting of the fruits increased progressively from 12 to 23 °C; it decreased at higher temperatures and no rot at all occurred at 35 °C. To reduce rotting without diminishing the shelf life, fruits have to be stored at 12 °C in the post harvest period. Relative humidity during storage had no effect on fruit decay. A low nitrogen fertilization of the crop decreased the degree of fruit rot but reduced also the production. The difference in fruit rot in the light and in the dark had no practical significance. Internal fruit rot was achieved by inoculation of the open flower; however, the majority of the fruits escaped infection. It took more than two days for the fungus to reach the fruit after infection of the style. Neither the method of inoculation, nor amending nutrients to the inoculum suspension influenced the incidence of internal fruit rot. Slight wounding by removing parts of the flower had no effect on the incidence of internal fruit rot, whereas severe wounding by blossom excision reduced it with 75 %. Inoculation of wilted flowers resulted in 60 % less infection than inoculation of fresh flowers. Some powdery mildew resistant cultivars showed resistance to internal fruit infection. This resistance was associated with a long style and a short flowering period. However, no obvious effect of the flowering period within a cultivar on the incidence of internal fruit rot was observed. Growing plants under drought stress markedly increased internal fruit infection. Duration of fruit growth and fruit thinning had no effect on fruit infection. Relative humidity had no effect either. For flower infection no free water seems to be needed. It is not yet clear whether some kind of defence mechanism to fruit infection existst from which the fungus may escape under certain circumstances. Under controlled environmental conditions infection of growing tips and leaves was rare at 60 % r. h., it increased at 95 % r. h. and was most serious if the plants were kept wet. A period of 1 hour of free water was sufficient for the initial stage of infection. For further expansion of the disease, leaf wetness was required. A high relative humidity did not predispose leaves to infection. Wounding was essential for infection of older leaves, but not for infection of young plant tissue. A higher <b>conidial</b> concentration increased <b>infection.</b> The effect of leaf wetting on the number of infected sites was comparable with the effect of a tenfold conidial concentration. In glasshouses with cucumbers grown in a commercial way, a lower night temperature in the pre-inoculation period, between 12 and 24 °C, increased the disease incidence later on in the season, whereas no postponed effect of the day temperature, between 17 and 26 °C, was observed. The daily maximum relative humidity was about 10 % lower in glasshouse compartments with a minimum ventilator opening than in compartments without a minimum ventilator opening. This decreased the disease incidence on uninoculated plants to 35 % and on fruits to 40 %. The spread of the disease from inoculated plants to uninoculated ones was more rapid under humid than under drier conditions. However, production was higher under more humid conditions. Disease incidence was higher at an interval of 5 °C between heating and ventilation than at an interval of 2 °C. Little ventilation with an electric fan at an interval of 5 °C between heating and ventilation hardly influenced the incidence of the disease. The influence of transition to day temperature 3 h before, 1 h before, 1 h after and 3 h after sunrise on the incidence of the disease was studied. The later the transition to day temperature took place, the longer the periods with high relative humidity were maintained, the longer the periods the fruits stayed wet by condensation of water and the higher the incidence of the disease on inoculated plants and fruits was. Inoculation of plants resulted in a high infection pressure and in an increase of the disease incidence on plants and fruits as well as in an increase of the number of misshapen fruits. Inoculation reduced the number of internodes by 18 % after four weeks and the number of fruits by 10 %. The male and female flowering cultivar Spotvrije was as susceptible to stem and fruit rot as the female flowering hybrid Farbio. The tested breeding material showed plant resistance, both in the young and mature stage, and resistance to external fruit rot if the fruits were slightly wounded. Resistance to internal fruit rot was not observed. Not always a correlation was found between the activities of fungicides in vitro and in vivo. Testing fungicides on young inoculated plants under humid conditions was a reliable method. Best control was obtained with benzimidazole fungicides, tolylfluanid and chlorothalonil. Ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors, used to control powdery mildew, and dicarboximides, used to control Botrytis, gave also some control of D. bryoniae. Frequent, preferably weekly sprays were necessary to obtain a reasonable effect. The disease has to he controlled by a combination of hygienic measures, chemical control and manipulation of the glasshouse environment, especially by preventing humid conditions. A contribution of resistance breeding is expected in the future...|$|R
