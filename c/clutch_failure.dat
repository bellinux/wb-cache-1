5|$|During the mid-1930s, George Eyston set many speed {{records with}} his Speed of the Wind car, powered by an unsupercharged Rolls-Royce Kestrel. In 1937 {{he built a}} massive new car, Thunderbolt, powered by two R engines to attempt the {{absolute}} land speed record. At first Eyston experienced <b>clutch</b> <b>failure</b> due to the combined power of the engines. Nevertheless, he took the record in November 1937, reaching 312mph (502km/h), and in 1938 when Thunderbolt reached 357.5mph (575km/h). When first built at Bean Industries in Tipton, the nearside engine fitted to Thunderbolt was R27 which had powered S1595 when it set the air speed record in 1931. The other was R25, used by the same aircraft to win the Schneider Trophy two weeks earlier. Eyston had also borrowed R17 from Sir Malcolm Campbell and, with the continuing support that Rolls-Royce extended to both Campbell and Eyston, he also {{had the option of}} using R39.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} session on Friday afternoon, Nico Rosberg was fastest, setting a time of 1:21.531. With the track tarmac still being very new, the surface was {{slippery}} and it was another session that {{saw a lot of}} drivers get caught out. The biggest accident of the practice came after just five minutes, when Max Verstappen crashed at the exit of the stadium, bringing out red flags. After the running resumed, Valtteri Bottas lost the rear of his Williams FW37, caused by a fault in his DRS flap, and crashed at turn one. He {{was not the only one}} having problems in the first corner, as Sergio Pérez, Carlos Sainz Jr. and Pastor Maldonado also went off there. Lewis Hamilton meanwhile had an off-track moment at turn four. Romain Grosjean had to end his first practice of the weekend early, when a <b>clutch</b> <b>failure</b> saw him park his car 28 minutes into the session. Jenson Button ran 25 laps and finished ninth fastest albeit spending half of the session in the pit lane, while the team equipped his car with a new power unit. Behind Rosberg, the two Red Bull drivers were second and third, ahead of Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel.|$|E

5000|$|In 2005, the BAII F6 Typhoon was disqualified from Motor {{magazines}} annual Performance Car of the Year competition due to {{a series}} of <b>clutch</b> <b>failures.</b> After initially blaming the magazines testers, FPV labelled the car as [...] "simply too powerful" [...] and withdrew the car from sale for several months while they engineered a fix. All of the cars released with the clutch issues were recalled.|$|R
5000|$|The {{transmission}} was {{a common}} problem; a clutch {{did not seem to}} exist which combined the ability to withstand [...] on a regular basis with the ability to give a smooth start. <b>Clutch</b> <b>failures</b> were commonplace.

25|$|In 1964 {{he drove}} in Formula Three for Tyrrell. His debut, {{in the wet}} at Snetterton on 15 March, was dominant; he took a 25-second lead in just two laps before {{coasting}} home to a win by 44 seconds. Within days, he was offered a Formula One ride with Cooper, but declined, preferring to gain experience under Tyrrell; he failed to win just two races (one to <b>clutch</b> <b>failure,</b> one to a spin) in becoming F3 champion.|$|E
25|$|For 2001, Häkkinen {{pledged to}} make a {{challenge}} for the World Championship, citing inspiration from {{the birth of his}} son Hugo. He also added that he was under less pressure to compete, saying that results over the previous year increased his desire to win. The season started badly for Häkkinen: He was forced into retirement in the opening round held in Australia due to a failure with his car's suspension resulting in his car spinning violently into a tyre barrier. The McLaren cars were off the pace in Malaysia, with Häkkinen managing to end at the 6th place. He retired from the following race in Brazil when his car stalled on the starting grid, Further points came at the San Marino Grand Prix. At the Spanish Grand Prix, Häkkinen looked on course to win his first victory of the season, until the final lap of the race, when his car was hampered with a <b>clutch</b> <b>failure</b> and was classified ninth.|$|E
25|$|Double world {{champion}} Alain Prost's McLaren {{had been having}} problems all weekend with the Frenchman finding the McLaren MP4/5 hard to set up, and when his two stop strategy was ruined by a <b>clutch</b> <b>failure,</b> {{he knew he had}} to continue the race having made just one of his scheduled two pit stops on the notoriously abrasive Rio circuit. He finished second. Nigel Mansell secured a surprising win for the Scuderia, with no problems despite ongoing gearbox faults all weekend and a lack of winter testing (Mansell also had the steering wheel come loose on the back straight and had to have it changed in his final stop, which luckily was scheduled for the end of that lap). The final step of the podium was taken by local Maurício Gugelmin. Grand Prix debutant Johnny Herbert, Derek Warwick and Alessandro Nannini scored the remaining points. Warwick was desperately unlucky. He lost over 20 seconds in a slow pit stop and only finished 17.8 seconds behind Mansell at the finish suggesting a win (which would have been both his and Arrows' first) or podium place had gone begging.|$|E
50|$|The Cromwell and Centaur {{were given}} {{additional}} {{time to work}} out these problems. The Cromwell's problems were mostly related to oil leaks and brake and <b>clutch</b> <b>failures,</b> an observer noting that these were well-known and should already have been corrected. The crews, however, expressed their love for the design, and especially its speed and handling. The Centaur was largely dismissed, with one observer expressing his hope that units were being equipped with it only for training purposes. The same reviewers unanimously supported the Sherman. A similar test in November demonstrated the Cromwell was improving, while the underpowered Centaur fared {{no better than the}} first test.|$|R
50|$|The {{front engine}} dragster came about due to engines {{initially}} being {{located in the}} car's frame {{in front of the}} driver. They did not use (and current dragsters still do not use) any form of suspension. Because of this, these types of vehicles were prone to becoming unstable at speed. This is due to their making , plus having poor tire technology, short wheelbases, and very light weight. (This was demonstrated to extremes in the Fuel Altereds.) The driver sits angled backward, {{over the top of the}} differential in a cockpit situated between the two rear tires, a design originating with Mickey Thompson in 1954, as a way of improving traction. This position led to many drivers being maimed when catastrophic <b>clutch</b> <b>failures</b> occurred.|$|R
40|$|Our {{goal was}} to {{document}} effects of year-round supplemental feeding on breeding ecology of the Buff-throated Partridge, Tetraophasis szechenyii, within a Tibetan sacred site. We evaluated effects of supplemental feeding used as religious/cultural practices which could potentially aid conservation of endangered phasianids. We compared fed breeding groups to neighboring nonfed groups. Fed groups initiated first clutches significantly earlier than nonfed groups. Earlier laying groups within fed and nonfed groups showed significantly lower hatching rates than later groups; however, fed groups showed significantly higher hatching rates than nonfed groups laying in the same period. Earlier laying increased opportunities to renest. All six fed groups with <b>clutch</b> <b>failures</b> renested compared to only one of five nonfed groups with <b>clutch</b> <b>failures.</b> Fed female breeders showed significantly greater investment in their young with larger clutches and larger eggs, which likely increased survivability of early hatchlings. We observed no predation on birds at feeding sites and recorded only four cases of predation on incubating females, which showed no detectable difference between fed and nonfed groups. Ground-nesting birds typically face high risks of predation. Ten of the 48 groups nested in trees, which occurs in few phasianid species. Tree nests showed significantly higher hatching rates compared to ground nests; however, we found {{no significant difference in}} tree nesting between fed and nonfed groups. This partridge is one of four gallinaceous species with cooperative breeding. Breeding groups with helpers had significantly greater reproductive success than single pairs, and fed female breeders with helpers laid bigger eggs than single pairs. Comparing annual reproductive output per group, fed groups not only produced significantly more independent young (≥ 150 days post-hatching), their young hatched significantly earlier, which likely have greater reproductive value over later hatched young of nonfed groups. Supplemental feeding year-round is likely what enabled the successes of the fed partridges...|$|R
25|$|Jamie Whincup {{began his}} title defence {{in a strong}} manner, taking pole {{position}} for both of the Saturday races. He {{went on to win}} the first race of the weekend ahead of Chaz Mostert and Fabian Coulthard. Scott McLaughlin, after qualifying third, failed to start the race after his car's oil pump failed on the warm-up lap. Whincup dropped down the order in the second race due to a puncture, while Coulthard took victory with James Courtney and Craig Lowndes rounding out the podium. McLaughlin jumped the start and served the resulting ten-second penalty under safety car conditions, which led to another ten seconds being added to his race time, while Mostert hit the wall at turn eight and retired from the race. Michael Caruso also hit the wall at turn eight after contact with David Reynolds led to a puncture. Will Davison, after retiring from the first race, failed to start the second after a <b>clutch</b> <b>failure</b> on the warm-up lap. Courtney won the final race of the weekend on Sunday ahead of Shane Van Gisbergen and Garth Tander. Whincup and Mostert made contact on the last lap while battling for fourth, which led to Mostert hitting the wall and being collected by James Moffat. Both Mostert and Moffat failed to complete the lap. Marcos Ambrose, after struggling on Saturday, qualified inside the top ten on Sunday and finished twelfth. Courtney left the event with the championship lead ahead of Coulthard and Tander.|$|E

50|$|In some cases, {{when the}} {{electronics}} {{of the trailer}} (especially the ABS sensors in the wheels) get wet, the brake pedal would not operate as normal, and even the slightest touch {{would result in a}} wheel-lock. There are problems with the calculation of the mileage available for the remaining fuel. Cases have been reported when the fuel has run out with the computer showing 25 more miles to go. Also, the statistics of average speed and fuel consumption are prone to failure when driving a digital tachograph truck without a driver card. This problem has now been solved by a software update from Mercedes.

50|$|Packard's {{successful}} {{development of}} its own automatic transmission was unique; no other independent (non-Big Three) automaker managed such a feat. The company's worsening situation throughout the 1950s, however, did not permit sufficient funds {{to keep up with}} the transmission development of the larger companies; Packard's attempts to update the Ultramatic were not sufficiently tested to iron out the problems, and those problems did damage to the company's reputation. Some automotive historians have argued that Packard should have dropped the Ultramatic after 1954, and purchased a more modern transmission design from another manufacturer but such opinions prove worthless when considering Packard's use of a locking torque converter was not only up to date but ahead of its time. In addition, the only true new modern transmission to appear was the Dual Coupling Hydra-Matic but that did not appear until 1956 and had serious teething problems {{of its own}}. In retrospect Packard's Twin Ultramatic's most serious design flaw was during the low to high shift transition where a poorly timed high clutch application and low band release over much of the allowable upshift range resulted in many premature high <b>clutch</b> <b>failures.</b> This situation resulted in an unusual sensitivity to individual driving habits determining useful clutch life. Therefore, while this transmission was certainly designed to physically accept a high torque V8, its control system likely needed another year of development.|$|R

50|$|Copulation {{occurs during}} and after nest building. The {{egg-laying}} period varies with latitude, weather, and possibly food supply. In the Canadian parts of the range, laying occurs from {{the latter part of}} April through late June, whereas farther south laying occurs from about March 20 through mid May. The earliest recorded clutch was in January in Utah and laying could occur as late as July 3 in Canada. Egg-laying occurs at two-day intervals with incubation starting when the first egg is laid. Incubation is shared by both sexes with each taking approximately the same number of shifts during the 32-day average incubation period.

50|$|The {{first race}} for the R86V was at the 500 km of Suzuka, entered by the lone Hoshino Racing Chassis 86G-5. The car caught fire and didn't start the race. The Person Racing Team car managed to qualify 10th and finish 5th in their first race, the 1000 km of Fuji, again, the only Nissan car to enter the event. Nissan Motorsport bought the 86G-5 Chassis for one race, the 24 hours of Le Mans 1986, failing to finish with gearbox failure after {{qualifying}} a distant 24th on the grid. Pearson Racing and Hoshino Racing both brought a car each to the Fuji 500 Mile race, the Person chassis 86G-8 qualifying 8th and finishing 12th and the Hoshino Racing car earning the pole, but retiring due to tire failure. The Hoshino car would gain its second pole position in a row at the Suzuka 1000 km, with the Person car qualifying 2nd on the grid, {{as well as the}} factory-backed Nismo Sport car (Chassis 86G-6) gaining 8th on the grid. Despite this, neither the Hoshino or Person cars nor the Nissan factory run car managed to finish the race, both the Nismo Sport and Hoshino cars retiring with <b>clutch</b> <b>failures,</b> the Person car having tire troubles. The Fuji 1000 km saw the streak of pole positions come to an end, yet also the streak of failing to finish a race coming to an end too, with the Hoshino car qualifying 4th and finishing 10th, the Nismo Sport factory car qualifying 5th and finishing 11th and the Person car qualifying 9th and suffering an engine failure. At the 500 km Fuji race, the last round of the 1986 season, the three cars managed to once again dominate the front row of the grid in qualifying, with the Nismo factory car taking pole, the Hoshino car scoring 2nd and the Person car qualifying 4th, though none of the three cars could finish this race either, with two transmission failures for the Hoshino and Nismo cars and a brake failure on the Person racing car.|$|R

Hence, an accurate estimation of the heat flux and temperatures on the friction surfaces is essential for proper design of the <b>clutch</b> to avoid <b>failure</b> due to thermal stresses. The dimensionless radius ratio (R=inner disc radius/outer disc radius) is the main key quantifying the quantities of heat flux and temperature on friction materials of clutch. Furthermore, the effect of (R) on the axial force, inner and outer radius, peripheral velocity and torque is investigated as well.

In this study, reproductive performance of Red-backed Shrikes breeding in grasslands in a 75 -km farmland landscape and clear-cuts in a 75 -km forest landscape was compared during 1994 - 1995. During 2003, order of settlement and reproductive performance as well as food abundance and nest predator abundance were assessed in a 3 -km area in each landscape type. The average number of fledglings was significantly higher in clear-cuts than in grasslands. Furthermore, post-fledgling survival and the probability of replacement <b>clutches</b> following nest <b>failure</b> {{were likely to be}} higher in clear-cuts than in grasslands due to the significantly earlier arrival date to clear-cuts.
