50|$|Also {{known as}} <b>cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine,</b> tetrahexamine tetranitramine, or octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine, HMX was first made in 1930. In 1949 it was {{discovered}} that HMX can be prepared by nitrolysis of RDX. Nitrolysis of RDX is performed by dissolving RDX in a 55% HNO3 solution, followed by placing the solution on a steambath for about six hours. HMX is used almost exclusively in military applications, including as the detonator in nuclear weapons, in the form of polymer-bonded explosive, and as a solid rocket propellant.|$|E

Three experimental approaches are presented. The following observed effects are discussed: reduction of particle size, alteration of particle morphology, and fracture of individual crystals...|$|E

Quantitation limits in the low nanogram per kilogram range proved the reliability of the method {{for the detection of}} explosives at ultra-trace levels. The reduced sample preparation allowed for low costs and high-throughput analyses. Finally, the superior extraction capability of the method was proved by obtaining DESI-HRMS responses at least five times higher than those achieved by performing DESI-HRMS analyses of solid-liquid extracts spotted onto commercial polytetrafluoroethylene slides...|$|E
40|$|The {{particle}} size distribution and morphology of HMX (<b>cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine)</b> in the plastic-bonded explosive, PBX 9501 (95 % HMX and 5 % polymeric binder, by weight), are important to understanding the micromechanical behavior of this material. This paper shows that the size distribution of the {open_quotes}as-received{close_quotes} HMX powder, as measured by light scattering, is not preserved through the processing operations of formulation into molding powder and subsequent consolidation through hydrostatic pressing. Morphological features such as cracking and twinning are examined using reflected light microscopy. This technique helps confirm and interpret {{the results of the}} {{particle size}} analysis. These results suggest that use of the {{particle size distribution}} of the {open_quotes}as-received{close_quotes} powder could potentially yield significant errors in detailed simulations of formulated materials...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} at Los Alamos National Laboratory explored the efficacy of ammonium hydroxide solutions in converting HMX (<b>cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine,</b> or Octogen) and HMX-based explosives to nonenergetic, nonhazardous materials. When 80 g of explosive was converted in a reactor operating at 85 psig pressure at 140 C, the principal gaseous products were nitrous oxide (46 % to 51 %), nitrogen (22 % to 32 %), and ammonia (17 % to 28 %). Formate and hexamethylene-tetramine (hexamine) account for effectively 100 % of the carbon-bearing aqueous species. Nitrate, nitrite, and acetate {{were present in the}} liquid in trace amounts. The process effectively treated molding powders of the plastic-bonded explosives PBX 9501 (2. 5 % estane), LX- 04 (15 % viton), and PBX 9404 (3 % nitrocellulose).

40|$|Abstract — Commonly available, nonconventional {{energetic}} {{materials such as}} H 2 O 2, ammonium nitrates (AN), as well as reactive materials (e. g., mixtures of metals and metal oxides), and con-ventional plastic explosives primarily made of pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), cyclotrimethyl-ene trinitramine (RDX), <b>cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine</b> (HMX), and triaminotrinitrobenzene (TATB), are often materials used in terrorist acts and become threats to homeland security. Thus, characterizing thermochemical properties of these materials at the blast-relevant conditions of pressure, temperature, and composition is critical for developing chemical methods to mitigate the associated threats. In this year, we have completed the investigation of chemical sensitivity of AN and its mixtures with hexane (i. e., ANFO) and aluminum (Ammonal), and made signifi cant progress on main group I peroxides, including Li 2 O 2 and Na 2 O 2 – adding to the previously studied H 2 O 2. The experiments employ diamond anvil cells (DAC), confocal micro-Raman spectroscopy, and third-generation synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The results on both AN and peroxides are signifi cant not only to understanding the fundamental properties of these high-value {{energetic materials}}, but also to gaining insights into what causes chemical sensitivity in energetic materials and fi nding the condi-tions limiting blast or detonation of AN and peroxides...|$|E
40|$|Compaction waves {{traveling}} through porous <b>cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine</b> (HMX) are computationally modeled using the Eulerian hydrocode CTH and validated with gas gun experimental data. The method employed {{use of a}} newly generated set of P-α parameters for granular HMX in a Mie-Gruneisen equation of state. The P-α model adds a separate parameter to differentiate between the volume changes of a solid material due to compression from the volume change due to compaction, void collapse in a granular material. Computational results are compared via five validation schema for two different initial-porosity experiments. These schema include stress measurements, velocity rise times and arrival times, elastic sound speeds though the material and final compaction densities {{for a series of}} two different percent Theoretical Maximum Density (TMD) HMX sets of experimental data. There is a good agreement between the simulations and the experimental gas gun data with the largest source of error being an 11 % overestimate of the peak stress which may be due to impedance mismatch on the experimental gauge interface. Determination of these P-α parameters are important as they enable modeling of porosity and are a vital first step in modeling of precursory hotspots, caused by hydrodynamic collapse of void regions or grain interactions, prior to deflagration to detonation transition of granular explosives...|$|E
40|$|Background: The defect {{structure}} of organic materials is important as it {{plays a major}} role in their crystal growth properties. It also can play a subcritical role in “hot-spot” detonation processes of energetics and one such energetic is <b>cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine,</b> in the commonly used beta form (β-HMX). Results: The as-grown crystals grown by evaporation from acetone show prismatic, tabular and columnar habits, all with 011, 110, (010) and (101) faces. Etching on (010) surfaces revealed three different types of etch pits, two of which could be identified with either pure screw or pure edge dislocations, the third is shown to be an artifact of the twinning process that this material undergoes. Examination of the 011 and 110 surfaces show only one type of etch pit on each surface; however their natural asymmetry precludes the easy identification of their Burgers vector or dislocation type. Etching of cleaved 011 surfaces demonstrates that the etch pits can be associated with line dislocations. All dislocations appear randomly on the crystal surfaces and do not form alignments characteristic of mechanical deformation by dislocation slip. Conclusions: Crystals of β-HMX grown from acetone show good morphological agreement with that predicted by modelling, with three distinct crystal habits observed depending upon the supersaturation of the growth solution. Prismatic habit was favoured at low supersaturation, while tabular and columnar crystals were predominant at higher super saturations. The twin plane in β-HMX was identified as a (101) reflection plane. The low plasticity of β-HMX is shown by the lack of etch pit alignments corresponding to mechanically induced dislocation arrays. On untwinned 010 faces, two types of dislocations exist, pure edge dislocations with b = [010] and pure screw dislocations with b = [010]. On twinned (010) faces, a third dislocation type exists and it is proposed that these pits are associated with pure screw dislocations with b = [010]...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this work, conductor-like {{screening}} for real solvents (COSMO-RS) calculations {{were carried out}} using COSMOtherm program in conjunction with Gaussian 03 packages. The objective was to predict thermodynamic properties for two nitrogen-rich energetic materials which are less harmful for the environment than the conventional ones, namely 3, 6 -di(hydrazino) - 1, 2, 4, 5 - tetrazine (DHT) and 3, 3 ’-azo-bis(6 -amino- 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetrazine) (DAAT) for which no experimental data are available to our best knowledge. COSMO-RS approach {{is a combination of}} quantum chemical and statistical thermodynamic basis, which allow a physically meaningful description of molecular interactions between pure molecules and solvents in solution. Recently, this approach has been used for the prediction of an enormous number of physicochemical properties especially aqueous solubility, Henry’s law constant, vapor pressure and partition coefficient. The vapor pressure of pure compounds {{is one of the most}} important thermodynamic properties required for the chemical process design as well as for the fate assessment of pollutants in the environment. To validate the accuracy of COSMO-RS approach for the two molecules of interest, six reference energetic molecules have been studied, for which experimental data are available, such as <b>cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine</b> (HMX), 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT), cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX), 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 -hexanitro- 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 -hexaazaisowurtzitane (CL- 20), 1, 1 -diamino- 2, 2 -dinitroethylene (FOX- 7) and n-methyl-p-nitroaniline (MNA). From predicted results, a good agreement has been noted. DAAT molecule shows a lower volatility in the medium so that a low detectability compared to the DHT and other reference molecules. Both DHT and DAAT showed negative logarithmic values of Octanol-Water partition coefficients, this means that they don’t have the tendency to enhance the bioaccumulation process in soils...|$|E
40|$|Energetic cocrystals are a {{new class}} of {{materials}} that consist of two or more reactive species in a unique crystal structure. The multicomponent crystal structure can possess significantly different properties than either component, and therefore it is possible that ignition phenomenon could be different than a physical mixture. In this paper we report the time to ignition and reaction dynamics of cocrystallized HNIW energetic materials under CO 2 laser heating. An effort was made to minimize the material used in comparison to previous laser ignition. 1 : 1 molar Trinitrotoluene (TNT) : Hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL- 20) produced by slurry and precipitation methods and 1 : 2 molar <b>cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine</b> (HMX) :CL- 20 produced by slurry and LabRAM methods were investigated in addition to the individual constituents and equivalent molar physical mixes for each. Cylindrical pellets with diameters of 3. 2 mm and heights between 1 and 2 mm were pressed of each material and a CO 2 laser was used to ignite the samples at irradiances ranging from 310 to 1446 W/cm 2. Visual light data was collected with a high speed camera and ultraviolet (UV) spectral data was collected with spectrometer coupled to a UV streak camera. Additionally, high speed schlieren imaging was performed to investigate the ignition dynamics prior to light generation. Ignition was characterized by both a ‘fully developed flame kernel’ and ‘first effect’ criteria in order for a more accurate comparison between materials. The cocrystallized materials were found to generate gas quicker than the constituents or a physical mixture although the times to the final flame kernel were less conclusive. Specific species identified with the spectrometer include OH and CN. Qualitatively the cocrystallized materials ignited similarly to their constituents. In particular the TNT:CL- 20 cocrystals ignited similarly to CL- 20 at low irradiances but resembled TNT at higher irradiances. ...|$|E
40|$|Recently criminals {{have used}} {{homemade}} explosives. Homemade explosives may refer to unconventional explosives (TATP, HMTD, UN, etc.) or conventional explosives (RDX, TNT, PETN, ANFO, etc.) prepared illegally. In {{order to prevent}} the use of homemade explosives as weapons, four different studies were performed {{in order to better}} understand the physical properties of these homemade explosives for the purposes of enhanced detection and safe destruction. ^ The vapor signature of diacetone diperoxide (DADP) and hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD) were examined by a gas chromatography (GC) headspace technique over the range of 15 to 55 °C. Parallel experiments were conducted to re-determine the vapor pressures of 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT) and triacetone triperoxide (TATP). The TNT and TATP vapor pressures were in agreement with previously reported results. Vapor pressure of DADP was determined to be 17. 7 Pa at 25 °C, which is approximately 2. 6 times higher than TATP at the same temperature. The Clapeyron equation, relating vapor pressure and temperature, was Ln P (Pa) = 35. 9 - 9845. 1 /T (K) for DADP. Heat of sublimation, calculated from the slope of the line for the Clapeyron equation, was 81. 9 kJ/mole. HMTD vapor pressure was not determined due to reduced thermal stability resulting in vapor phase decomposition products. ^ Thermal behaviors, vapor pressures, densities, and drop weight impact results, as well as analytical protocols, are reported for three tetranitrate esters: erythritol tetranitrate (ETN), 1, 4 -dinitrato- 2, 3 -dinitro- 2, 3 bis(nitratomethylene) butane (DNTN), and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN). ETN and DNTN both melt below 100 °C and have ambient vapor pressures comparable to TNT. While LC/MS was shown to be a viable technique for analysis of all three tetranitrate esters, only ETN was successfully analyzed by GC/MS. Performance of these nitrate esters as evaluated in lab using the small-scale explosivity device (SSED) suggested RDX 3 ̆e 3 ̆e DNTN 3 ̆e PETN 3 ̆e ETN. Detonation velocities were calculated using Cheetah 6. 0. Since the starting material is now widely available, it is likely that law enforcement will find ETN in future improvised explosive devices. This paper with its analytical schemes should prove useful in identification of this homemade explosive. ^ Vapor pressure is a fundamental physical characteristic of chemicals. Some solids have very low vapor pressures. Nevertheless numerous chemical detection instruments aim to detect vapors. Herein we address issues with explosive detection and use thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to estimate vapor pressures. Benzoic acid, whose vapor pressure is well characterized, was used to calculate instrumental parameters related to sublimation rate. Once calibrated, the rate of mass loss from TGA measurements was used to obtain vapor pressures of the 12 explosives at elevated temperature: explosive salts-guanidine nitrate (GN); urea nitrate (UN); ammonium nitrate (AN); as well as mono-molecular explosives hexanitrostilbene (HNS); <b>cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine</b> (HMX), 4, 10 -dinitro- 2, 6, 8, 12 -tetraoxa- 4, 10 -diaza-tetracyclododecane (TEX), cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX), pentaerythritol tetranitrate(PETN), 3 -nitro- 1, 2, 4 -triazol- 5 -one (NTO), 3 -nitro- 1, 2, 4 -triazol- 5 -one (TNAZ), triacetone triperoxide (TATP), and diacetone diperoxide (DADP). Ambient temperature vapor pressures were estimated by extrapolation of Clausius-Clapeyron plots (i. e. ln P versus 1 /T). With this information, potential detection limits can be assessed. ...|$|E
