Even though, {{there is a relationship}} between celebrity endorsement and <b>customer</b> <b>based</b> brand equity, many scholars have implied that several variables and dimensions also impact on these celebrity endorsement and <b>customer</b> <b>based</b> brand equity broadly. This qualitative comprehensive review explores with the various literature supports for the relationship variables to celebrity endorsement and <b>customer</b> <b>based</b> brand equity. To extend and facilitate further studies contextually and empirically, a comprehensive model is presented to demonstrate how these relationship variables relate to celebrity endorsement and <b>customer</b> <b>based</b> brand equity.

5|$|Bowling as a {{participation}} sport {{flourished in}} the early 1960s, but its popularity was diluted due to overbuilding; the number of bowling alleys sanctioned by the then-American Bowling Congress peaked at about 11,000 by mid-decade, and Kona was {{one of more than}} 30 in southern California alone. A decline in league bowling starting in the 1980s was also blamed for the downturn, but an AMF Bowling official argued that the <b>customer</b> <b>base</b> remained steady because an increase in open bowling made up for fewer league bowlers.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to a small}} <b>customer</b> <b>base</b> in Japan, Alisia Dragoon sold few copies on {{its release}} (April 24, 1992); the console it was made for, the Sega Mega Drive, was not a popular device in Japan, selling 33.5million units (10% of all Mega Drives/Genesis sold around the world). The game was {{published}} earlier by Sega for North America and Europe, on March 30. However, it was a subdued release; Sega did not place major advertisements for {{the game in the}} media. To localize the contents for the Western market, the video game publisher made several cosmetic changes to Alisia Dragoon. Instead of a big-eyed heroine drawn in typical anime styling, Alisia was portrayed as a golden bikini-wearing female barbarian on the box covers outside Japan. The Western version of Alisia was likened to the scantily clad females in artist Boris Vallejo's work.|$|E

5|$|Miri Hospital started {{operation}} on 6 May 1995, located 2.5km away from Miri city centre {{and with an}} area of 87.11 hectares. The hospital has 339 beds, and it provides specialist services such as surgery, ophthalmology, obstetrics and gynaecology (ONG), and radiology. It is also the secondary referral hospital in the northern region of Sarawak. There are also 2 polyclinics in Miri namely Miri polyclinic and Tudan polyclinic. Miri City Medical Centre is a private hospital that started its operation in 2002 and has 30 beds. It is located at Hokkien Road, Miri. Columbia Asia Medical Centre was formerly known as Selesa Medical Centre. It was acquired in 1998, located 4km downtown Miri. It serves the communities from Miri, Limbang, Marudi, and Brunei. Shell employees make up the largest <b>customer</b> <b>base</b> for this private hospital.|$|E
5|$|The company faced a {{difficult}} situation again in 1967 when {{the total number of}} vehicles produced was just 381 units. At the beginning of 1968 VAT fired 40 of the 400 employees. Vanaja had its staunch <b>customer</b> <b>base</b> and the vehicles were generally well regarded but the overall market share remained low; in 1963 just 4‚Äì5% of the newly registered heavy lorries in Finland were Vanajas. The highly customised production had led to an excessive diversity of models, which made spare part supply difficult. Moreover, the customising presumably took resources away from technical development work. There was no change for the better although the company introduced its modern forward control model B6-76 which was expected to become the next volume model.|$|E
5|$|After the 2000 acquisition, Renault renamed Samsung Motors as Renault Samsung Motors (RSM). That year, the company's sales {{began to}} improve. Journalists {{attribute}} {{this to the}} success of the first car manufactured at Busan in taxi fleets (the SM5), which led to increased confidence of the model within the rest of their <b>customer</b> <b>base.</b> During the following years, the company introduced a new vehicle range, including the SM3 in 2002, the SM7 in 2004 and the crossover QM5 in 2007. Over time, RSM changed its products from a Nissan-based architecture to a Renault-based one. As part of the Renault group, Renault Samsung basically became an export-oriented manufacturer. Despite not being exported under their own brand, Renault Samsung-manufactured vehicles have over the time been rebadged as Renault or Nissan, and sold in markets such as Europe (QM5 and SM5), Russia, Ukraine, Mexico, Egypt, Central and South America, the Middle East (SM3 and SM5), China (SM7), Australia (QM5), or the United States and Canada (the Rogue).|$|E

40|$|Purpose ‚Äì The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{increase}} the knowledge about technology based services affection of the ability of retail banks to build <b>customer</b> <b>based</b> brand equity among students. Design/methodology/approach ‚Äì A conceptual model has been developed from theories regarding <b>customer</b> <b>based</b> brand equity, switching barriers and choice criteria. Based on this conceptual model, seven in depth interviews including several brand elicitation techniques were conducted. Findings ‚Äì The findings show that students perceive the target banks to be rather similar, especially regarding technologies. In addition, the students are satisfied with their bank, however; the technology based services have difficulties in creating true <b>customer</b> <b>based</b> brand equity. Behind this difficulties are the special character of financial service combined with the student role. Together, these results suggest that the banks need to do something besides the actual services in order to build <b>customer</b> <b>based</b> brand equity and keep the customers for a long term relationship. These strategies must be developed and implemented carefully in order to keep the current image of credibility. Research limitations/implications ‚Äì The paper has not included comprehensive eliciting techniques and this must be taken into account when reflecting about unconscious brand associations. ¬† Practical implications ‚Äì The findings include good insights and advices that bank managers can use to create meaningful differentiations in the future and attract and keep students as customers for a long time. ¬† Originality/value - The paper combines <b>customer</b> <b>based</b> brand equity with switching barriers, which give valuable insights to both banks and researchers. Moreover, the time period of the study related to the technological innovation provides the brand equity research in the financial sector with updated knowledge...|$|R
5|$|The period {{also saw}} the {{development}} of charter fairs in England, which reached their heyday in the 13th century. From the 12th century onwards, many English towns acquired a charter from the Crown allowing them to hold an annual fair, usually serving a regional or local <b>customer</b> <b>base</b> and lasting {{for two or three}} days. The practice increased in the next century and over 2,200 charters were issued to markets and fairs by English kings between 1200 and 1270. Fairs grew in popularity as the international wool trade increased: the fairs allowed English wool producers and ports on the east coast to engage with visiting foreign merchants, circumnavigating those English merchants in London keen to make a profit as middlemen. At the same time, wealthy magnate consumers in England began to use the new fairs as a way to buy goods like spices, wax, preserved fish and foreign cloth in bulk from the international merchants at the fairs, again bypassing the usual London merchants.|$|E
5|$|West {{points out}} that Kaifeng shopkeepers rarely had time to eat at home, so they chose {{to go out and}} eat at a variety of places such as restaurants, temples, and food stalls. Restaurant {{businesses}} thrived on this new clientele, while restaurants that catered to regional cooking targeted customers such as merchants and officials who came from regions of China where cuisine styles and flavors were drastically different than those commonly served in the capital. The pleasure district mentioned above‚Äîwhere stunts, games, theatrical stage performances, taverns and singing girl houses were located‚Äîwas teeming with food stalls where business could be had virtually all night. West makes a direct connection between the success of the theatre industry and the food industry in the cities. Of the fifty some theatres within the pleasure districts of Kaifeng, four of these could entertain audiences of several thousand each, drawing huge crowds which would then give nearby businesses an enormous potential <b>customer</b> <b>base.</b> Besides food, traders in eagles and hawks, precious paintings, as well as shops selling bolts of silk and cloth, jewelry of pearls, jade, rhinoceros horn, gold and silver, hair ornaments, combs, caps, scarves, and aromatic incense thrived in the marketplaces.|$|E
5|$|While {{the key to}} Albany's {{economic}} prosperity in the 19th century was transportation, industry and business also played a role. Largely thanks to the city's Dutch and German roots, beer was one of its biggest commodities. Beverwyck Brewery, originally known as Quinn and Nolan (Nolan being mayor of Albany 1878‚Äì1883), was the last remaining brewer from that time when it closed in 1972. The city's location at {{the east end of}} the Erie Canal gave it unparalleled access to both raw products and a captive <b>customer</b> <b>base</b> in the west. Albany was known for its publishing houses, and to some extent, still is. Albany was second only to Boston in the number of books produced for most of the 19th century. Iron foundries in both the north and south ends of the city brought thousands of immigrants to the city. To this day, one can see many intricate wrought-iron details on older buildings. The iron industry waned by the 1890s due to increased costs associated with a newly unionized workforce and the opening of mines in the Mesabi Range in Minnesota.|$|E
