5|$|<b>Combat</b> <b>in</b> {{the game}} is similar to its predecessor, with the main series of {{missions}} beginning after an opening tutorial. The game features ground-based hack-and-slash gameplay and aerial <b>combat.</b> <b>In</b> ground combat, the player controls multiple characters, switching between them via the pause menu {{in order to use}} their different weapons. The characters use physical attacks using character weapons for short-range battle, while magical attacks are used for long-range attacks and groups of enemies. The magical attacks vary between the playable characters. Weapons, characters and magical abilities leave up and grow stronger as the player gains experience points in combat: weapons have a four-level cap.|$|E

5|$|Alternatively, Pachycephalosaurus {{and other}} pachycephalosaurid genera may {{have engaged in}} flank-butting during {{intraspecific}} <b>combat.</b> <b>In</b> this scenario, an individual may have stood roughly parallel or faced a rival directly, using intimidation displays to cow its rival. If intimidation failed, the Pachycephalosaurus would bend its head downward and to the side, striking the rival pachycephalosaur on its flank. This hypothesis {{is supported by the}} relatively broad torso of most pachycephalosaurs, which would have protected vital organs from trauma. The flank-butting theory was first proposed by Sues in 1978, and expanded upon by Ken Carpenter in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>combat</b> <b>in</b> {{the game}} follows a {{strictly}} turn-based formula, the turn {{sequence of the}} characters you have are calculated based on the speed statistic of the character, {{and in some cases}} characters are allowed to strike before enemies can act if they possess sufficient speed.
