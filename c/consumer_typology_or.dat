40|$|Co-creation with {{consumers}} is increasingly attracting {{the interest of}} Companies, as {{a rich source of}} innovation and value creation. However, the drivers of consumer’s interest toward co-creation and how they change among different segments are still unclear. This article explores these questions, by investigating the triggers of consumer’s interest in terms of (i) product-related drivers, namely product industry, product knowledge and prior co-creation experience, and (ii) personal motivations and inhibitors. Further, the work investigates the way personality traits of the consumer affect perceived motivations and inhibitors and co-creation tools preference. Findings from 509 participants in a survey study reveal that both personal and product-related drivers affect the interest toward co-creation projects: monetary and personal benefits {{have a positive impact on}} co-creation interest as well as prior co-creation experience and high product knowledge. Further, motivations, inhibitors and co-creation tools preferences vary according to the <b>consumer</b> <b>typology.</b> Hence, this work underlines the importance of delivering tangible benefits to attract consumers in co-creation projects and to design the activity according to the <b>consumer</b> <b>typology</b> the firm wants to attract...|$|R

The authors further add an additional dimension to defining “luxury”. Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory design utilising multiple qualitative research tools (semi-structured interviews, focus groups) provides the basis for this research. A grounded analysis was applied. Findings: Findings map motivational drivers to purchasing luxury products and establish a fourth consumer type “indulgers”. Well-being further emerged as a key characteristic that defines “luxury”. Research limitations/implications: The sample size is limited to Chinese consumers purchasing luxury fashion in the UK, and thus may not be generalised. Practical implications: This research helps managers to understand the consumer types and underlying motivations of Chinese consumers purchasing luxury fashion in the UK. As one of the largest target groups, this research informs managers on how to further capitalise on this market. Originality/value: This paper creates a new <b>consumer</b> <b>typology</b> that not only categorises consumers according to their consumption aspects, but further identifies their underlying motivations to do so...|$|R

Basing market segmentations on consumer lifestyles enables the development of purposeful advertising strategies and the design of new products meeting future demands. The present paper introduces a new growing self-organizing neural network which identifies lifestyles, or rather consumer types, in survey data largely autonomously. Before applying the algorithm to real marketing data we are going to demonstrate its general performance and adaptability by means of synthetic 2 D data featuring distinct heterogeneity with respect to the arrangement of the individual data points.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop <b>consumer</b> <b>typology,</b> classify <b>consumers</b> by using food-related decision-making styles and link the resulting <b>typology</b> with <b>consumer</b> shopping behaviour. A modified Sproles and Kendall’s CSI instrument was used to identify decision-making styles in food-product context in Croatia. The data obtained from the survey was analysed using factor, cluster and ANOVA analyses. Three groups of consumers were identified: Recreational, Novelty-driven and Economic consumers. The study confirms that food-related consumers’ decision-making (CDM) styles can be used for market segmentation. Significant differences among groups were found for monthly food expenditure, expenditure at main retailers and expenditure on major trips. Marketers should take into account the characteristics of the identified groups while developing marketing programmes...|$|R
40|$|Marketers {{have for}} several years dealt with {{consumer}} heterogeneity by segmenting the market to identify and address different consumer clusters.

In addition, whilst the role of emotions in consumer decision making is well-documented in the marketing literature (e. g., Han, Lerner and Keltner 2007; Kwortnik and Ross 2007), there is no <b>consumer</b> <b>typology</b> based on online users’ feelings.

40|$|Macroinvertebrate {{community}} {{patterns are}} often analysed {{and related to}} the ecological quality or conservation value of a water body, using an ecological <b>typology</b> <b>or</b> assessment system. The goal {{of this study was}} to determine the effect on the development or application of a <b>typology</b> <b>or</b> assessment system of different choices concerning (1) taxonomic adjustment of the data, (2) the data that are included in the analyses and the community variables focussed on, and (3) the techniques chosen. It appeared that it is very difficult to distinguish and characterise macroinvertebrate communities unambiguously. In developing a <b>typology</b> <b>or</b> assessment system the results depend on the taxonomic level used and on the completeness of the data. Also, the choice of the technique influences the final result. In applying a <b>typology</b> <b>or</b> assessment system it is of importance to use the same taxonomic level as the data used for development and to include all taxa collected. Even taxa with low abundances or small distribution ranges appeared to be important. The number of rare taxa was indicative for a high ecological quality, in contrast to the total number of taxa in a sample. Communities composed of a high number of characteristic species were easier to distinguish than communities composed of more generalists. In conclusion, community analysis is not an objective process, because of the large effect of small technical changes. This is also caused by the fact that any classification of species assemblages is artificial. A community only exists of a combination of populations at a moment on a site and it is impossible to collect the complete community in a sample. Communities are a continuum along an environmental gradient. Species are adapted to their environment (which is characterised by stability, favourability and impairment) by their life tactics. Therefore, water management should rather focus on these life tactics in relation to the environment to investigate the stressor(s) present and the possibilities for restoration. To establish the conservation value of a site, the number of rare species can be used...|$|R

40|$|<b>Consumer</b> <b>typologies</b> reveal {{categories}} of the consumer that stretch from the vulnerable to the empowered notion of the consumer citizen. At the empowered end of this spectrum, consumers in Europe have a developing, normative, organisational structure that provides channels for the consumer to influence consumer policy at the European level. This is an organisational structure with mechanisms for developing an effective consumer empowerment and enforcement framework across all EU Member States. It is a framework that forms a coherent whole with the European-level consumer institutions. This paper examines the integrated nature of these institutions and their role in influencing the development of consumer policy through a multi-level platform of new governance. It discusses the normative processes that, through empowerment and engagement, are encouraging a consumer citizenship practice to exploit these channels of communication in order to influence policy development...|$|R
40|$|Online group buying, as a {{new form}} of e-commerce, {{is one of the most}} {{innovative}} e-commerce business models. This model offers great opportunities for e-marketers, but also brings new challenges. In the last four years, more than 5000 online group buying vendors in China have gone out of business. Existing literature suggests that online group buying is distinctive from online shopping, and consumers are motivated to use online group buying to enjoy different benefits. As little research has been conducted on understanding consumers in this context, group buying websites have few guidelines to follow to improve competitiveness. This thesis addresses this challenge by exploring the hierarchical motivations underlying consumers’ online group buying behaviour and the development of <b>consumer</b> <b>typologies</b> from a new perspective. Specifically, utilising a Uses and Gratifications (U&G) approach and Means-End Chain (MEC) theory perspective, this study aims not only to explore the content of online group buyers’ motivations, but also uncover the inter-relationships among these motivations. Moreover, it aims to introduce a new method to segment consumer, based on benefit-level motivations, which can provide more accurate <b>consumer</b> <b>typologies.</b> To reach these objectives the laddering interview technique was used to collect data from 58 online group buyers in China. A context-specific hierarchical motive model was developed, based on the 35 motivations identified, which not only indicated consumer value/goal fulfilment paths, but also illustrated the relative importance of different paths. Moreover, three typologies of group buyers with distinct value/goal fulfilment paths were identified, fundamentally different from existing shopper typologies in the e-commerce context. As a timely topic using a novel approach to explore consumer online group buying motivations, this study adds to the online group buying literature, introduces a new segmentation approach that overcomes the limitations of the traditional rating-scale based segmentation, and demonstrates theories and techniques derived from other disciplines that can be effectively applied to information systems and e-commerce research. This study will also help practitioners involved in online group buying businesses to better plan and design strategies to attract and retain current and potential consumers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{analysis}} of the consumer behavior {{has become one of}} the most important aspects in the way companies make their decision and the way they develop their strategy. Knowing the motivation and the behavior of buying of the consumers can help companies develop their strategy accordingly and by this to convince the consumers to buy more. Besides this, the behavior of the consumer is a good reflection of the image of the society, its values and its important aspects. So knowing the motivation of buying doesn’t only give directions to companies for their strategy, but also shows the development of a society. The facts presented in this article are based on an experiment about the behavior of the consumers in different retail formats in Romania. More precisely, from the observed behavior of the Romanian consumers there were build six clusters, which present the way consumers shop and the product groups which are more important for them.
