40|$|Culture {{can be a}} {{challenging}} issue that many business leaders encounter. A business leader does experience the difficulty of understanding and communication of another culture and may easily breach the cultural customs of a foreign country without being educated of this particular culture. First important <b>cultural</b> <b>issue</b> is stereotyping. When scrutinizing a culture, a business leader must be extremely careful not to stereotype about personality traits once he/she sees. All cultures do have significant personality differences. Second important <b>cultural</b> <b>issue</b> is that business leaders need to take cultural lessons about that particular foreign country that they wish to do business with. Many cultures have the utmost respect for higher levels of ritual. For example, a Japanese business negotiator may observe long silent pauses (silent communication) when a business leader’s convincing point is being considered. Third important <b>cultural</b> <b>issue</b> is language issue. Business leaders {{need to understand the}} foreign country’s language as well as regional differences that may be too subtle to notice.

5|$|It {{took two}} hours of intense {{discussion}} to elect the presidium of the Seimas.

Other members were Antanas Smetona, priest Petras Būčys, and Juozas Stankūnas; the secretaries were Liudas Gira, Pranas Klimaitis, and Juozas Gabrys-Paršaitis. The organizational committee proposed a rather academic agenda geared toward <b>cultural</b> <b>issues</b> for the assembly; this initial agenda was vetoed by the delegates. They adopted a new schedule that was more political and highlighted two main goals: holding hearings on the current situation in Lithuania, and deciding which political demands should be submitted to the Tsarist authorities. A major portion of the first day's proceedings was devoted to reports presented by delegates from rural areas. The content of these reports was repetitious and did not carry much weight. The most important question was that of Lithuanian autonomy.|$|E
