Then we will introduce the concept of monolithic arrays, and the idea of symmetry of array axes. Finally, we will discuss parallelism. In Section 2, we compare our work with array theories.

40|$|A SAS {{index is}} a search file {{associated}} with a data file. Given a key, the file is searched and, if the key is found, its record ID is returned and used to retrieve the data file record. For many practical tasks, this works sufficiently fast. But fast is never fast enough- SAS indexes are disk-resident and so leave much room for acceleration. SAS automaintains its indexes, which is splendid. But oftentimes the trade-off is programmatic rigidity. When either overweighs the pain to program, the indexing scheme suddenly appears to virtually lend itself to custom crafting. Being no longer tied to a particular search algorithm or storage medium, you can let your programming fancy fly, {{the power of the}} SAS language being at your disposal. The pain disappears. The disk-resident index file yields to a memory-based look-up returning a file pointer. B-trees are defenestrated in favor of search algorithms chosen for speed and/or to fit a particular key structure. This is a how-to paper about “external ” indexing.

40|$|It is {{notoriously}} difficult to program a solid web application. Besides addressing web interactions, state maintenance, and whimsical user navigation behaviors, programmers must also avoid a minefield of security vulnerabilities. The problem is fundamentally twofold. On the one hand, we lack {{a clear understanding}} of the essence of the new computation model underlying web applications. On the other hand, we lack proper abstractions for hiding common and subtle <b>coding</b> <b>details</b> that are orthogonal to the business functionalities of specific web applications. This report addresses both issues. First, we present a high-level language BASS for declarative server-side scripting. BASS allows programmers to work in an ideal world, using some new abstractions to tackle common but problematic aspects of web programming. The meta properties of BASS provide useful security guarantees. Second, we present a low-level language MOSS reflecting realistic web programming concepts and scenarios, thus articulating the computation model behind web programming. Finally, we present a rigorous translation from BASS to MOSS, demonstrating how the ideal programming model and security guarantees of BASS can be implemented and enforced in practice. 1...|$|E
40|$|The Box Counting {{algorithm}} {{is a well-known}} method for the computation of the fractal dimension of an image. It is often implemented using a recursive subdivision of the image into a set of regular tiles or boxes. Parallel implementations often try to map the boxes to different compute units, and combine the results to get {{the total number of}} boxes intersecting a shape. This paper presents a novel and highly efficient method using OpenCL kernels to perform the computation on a per-pixel basis. The mapping and reduction stages are performed in a single pass, and therefore require the enqueuing of only a single kernel. Each instance of the kernel updates the information pertaining to all the boxes containing the pixel, and simultaneously increments the box counters at multiple levels, thereby eliminating the need for another pass to perform the summation. The complete implementation and <b>coding</b> <b>details</b> of the proposed method are outlined. The performance of the method on different processors are analysed with respect to varying image sizes...|$|E
40|$|The {{quality of}} a J 2 EE web {{application}} depends on both the correctness of the code {{as well as the}} efficiency and flexibility of its architecture. Unfortunately, the design and development process is complex and includes tedious <b>coding</b> <b>details,</b> making it error-prone. Part of the problem lies in the incomplete abstractions provided by the J 2 EE specification. The artifacts of the distributed system environment are still present in applications and cannot be ignored, notably interfaces for distributed objects, name space information, and deployment information. In this paper, we present the detailed design of our design-pattern-based J 2 EE development system, RoadMapAssembler. This system shows that a J 2 EE architectural framework can be generated by assembling a set of design patterns in an incremental fashion, exploiting our knowledge of pattern implementations and inter-pattern relationships. This same knowledge also allows us to generate code for the distributed system artifacts that pollute J 2 EE applications. We demonstrate these features through the development of an example J 2 EE application...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Spatial reuse is an {{important}} challenge in multi-cell WLAN networks, such as Ad-Hoc and Mesh Networks, as well as sectorized antenna WLANs. However, the asynchronous handshake employed in the 802. 11 MAC protocol is a severe limiting factor. Multiple parallel communications occurring between transmit/receive node pairs separated by a sufficient distance may be suddenly impaired by the asynchronous change of direction in the transmission occurring when a node replies with an ACK frame (this phenomenon, duly discussed in this paper, will be hereafter referred to as Hidden ACK Phenomenon). Goal {{of this paper is}} to show that Interference Cancellation mechanisms implemented as PHY-layer enhancements on the receiver side provide the ability to improve reception of frames interfering with bursty ACK transmissions in the proximity of the receiver. This improvement is achieved without requiring changes to the legacy MAC IEEE 802. 11 basic access mode. Quantitative results are obtained for the widespread 802. 11 g PHY, taking into account its modulation and <b>coding</b> <b>details.</b> We quantify the Signal-To-Interference ratio under which ACK interference cancellation is effective, and derive the corresponding distance region where ACK cancellation is achievable. We conclude the paper by discussing the system-level applicability of our findings, with particular reference to the topological analysis to overcome the Hidden ACK Phenomenon through Interference Cancellation.

40|$|The {{past thirty}} years have seen a rapid growth in the {{popularity}} and use of Genetic Algorithms for searching for optimal or near-optimal solutions to optimisation problems. One {{of the reasons for}} their immense success {{is the fact that the}} principles governing the algorithm are simple enough to be appreciated and understood. The major differences between one Genetic Algorithm and another lie within the schemes used to represent chromosomes, the semantics of the genetic operators, and the measures used to evaluate their fitness. Yet, these very differences make Genetic Algorithms so complex to design and implement when opposed with most real-world optimisation problems. The truth is that the people faced with these types of optimisation problems are not necessarily computer sci- entists or machine learning experts. Indeed, these types of problems constantly appear in various non-computing disciplines ranging from biology to manufacturing and economics. In this report, we present a simple, yet powerful, high-level technique that can be used to describe the structure of chromosomes and how their fitness can be evaluated. The method is abstract enough to insulate the practitioner from all the implementation, design, and <b>coding</b> <b>details</b> usually associated with a Genetic Algorithm. Nonetheless, a wide array of optimisation problems ranging from the classical travelling salesman problem and the n-Queens problem to time-table scheduling and dynamic programs can be described. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Mashups {{have emerged}} as an {{innovative}} software trend that re-interprets existing Web building blocks and leverages the composition of individual components in novel, value-adding ways. Additional appeal also derives from their potential to turn non-programmers into developers. Daniel and Matera have written the first comprehensive reference work for mashups. They systematically cover the main concepts and techniques underlying mashup design and development, the synergies among the models involved {{at different levels of}} abstraction, and the way models materialize into composition paradigms and architectures of corresponding development tools. The book deliberately takes a balanced approach, combining a scientific perspective on the topic with an in-depth view on relevant technologies. To this end, {{the first part of the}} book introduces the theoretical and technological foundations for designing and developing mashups, as well as for designing tools that can aid mashup development. The second part then focuses more specifically on various aspects of mashups. It discusses a set of core component technologies, core approaches, and architectural patterns, with a particular emphasis on tool-aided mashup development exploiting model-driven architectures. Development processes for mashups are also discussed, and special attention is paid to composition paradigms for the end-user development of mashups and quality issues. Overall, the book is of interest to a wide range of readers. Students, lecturers, and researchers will find a comprehensive overview of core concepts and technological foundations for mashup implementation and composition. Even without low-level <b>coding</b> <b>details,</b> practitioners like software architects will find guidance on key implementation concepts, architectural patterns, and development tools and approaches.
