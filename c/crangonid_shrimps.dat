50|$|Another study {{examined}} {{the rate at which}} the discarded invertebrates sank to the bottom and their ultimate fates. O. ophiura sank relatively slowly and was preyed upon by seabirds, and the arms were eaten by fish. On the sea bed, a succession of benthic scavengers thrived on their remains with <b>crangonid</b> <b>shrimps</b> and crabs such as Carcinus maenas and Liocarcinus depurator being prominent. In six hours, little remained except the limbs of crustaceans and the discs of ophiuroids. The crab Pagurus bernhardus was the most likely scavenger to consume O. ophiura in baited traps.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{collected}} {{a total of}} 336 specimens of Pacific cod, Gadus macrocephalus during April, May and June 1989 - 1992 off the eastern coast of Hokkaido. Examination of their stomach contents revealed that fishes (mainly walleye pollock, Theragra chalcogramma) and decapod crustaceans (mainly <b>crangonid</b> <b>shrimps)</b> were major diet. The cod showed an obvious body size related dietary shift; the importance of shrimps (Neocrangon communis and Argis lar) and myctophid fishes for 5300 mm individuals switched abruptly to walleye pollock and other fishes (e. g. Sardinops melanostictus, Laemonema longipes, stichaeid and cottid fishes) and octopus, Paroctopus spp. for larger individuals. The cod showed an obvious feeding periodicity with a peak of feeding during 0600 - 1200 h. The comparison of prey size and prey type (benthos and nekton) for different size classes of predators indicated that the cod diet is determined by predator-prey size relationship. 1...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{growth and}} reproduction biology of Philocheras trispinosus (P. trispinosus) with abundance of other caridean shrimps caught by beam trawl in the Southern Black Sea. Methods: Samplings {{were carried out}} monthly with a beam trawl of 2 m length and 15 mm cod-end mesh size between December 2012 and November 2013. All individuals were sampled between 1 and 40 + m water depth from 146 hauls. Results: A total of 550 P. trispinosus, 618 Palaemon adspersus, 12 Palaemon serratus, 11 Philocheras fasciatus and 10 Crangon crangon were sampled during the study period. The <b>crangonid</b> <b>shrimps</b> started appearing during the winter and spring {{and the number of}} individuals increased to reach their highest value in mid-winter and mid-spring. The seasonal von Bertalanffy growth parameters for P. trispinosus were estimated as L∞ = 29. 3 mm total length, K = 0. 860 /year, t 0 = – 0. 900 year, C = 0. 180, and ts = 0. 010. The start of the slow growth period was at the beginning of July (WP = 0. 510). Ovigerous females appeared in the sampling area between January and April. Size at sexual maturity was estimated as 25. 69 mm total length. Conclusions: The results supported the distribution and abundance of caridean shrimp species from the study area and the population dynamics of the most abundant shrimp species, P. trispinosus. The current study can be answered as baseline data prior to management strategies to ensure sustainable conservation of the shrimp species...|$|E
40|$|Three {{specimens}} of the <b>crangonid</b> sand <b>shrimp</b> species Crangon uritai are reported from the muddy intertidal zone of Newport in Port Phillip Bay, Victoria. The {{discovery of the}} species in the bay is the first record of the genus Crangon from Australian waters and the first report of the East Asian coastal species Crangon uritai from the southern hemisphere. Its status as an introduced species is suggested and the likely vector for introduction is discussed. A key to the identification of <b>crangonid</b> <b>shrimp</b> species from Port Phillip Bay is included...|$|R

Development to the first juvenile stage took 15 days at 18 °C and 36 ‰ salinity.

40|$|A new genus of <b>crangonid</b> <b>shrimp</b> {{from the}} Arafura Sea is {{described}} and illustrated. Pontocheras arafurae sp. n. occurs in shallow silty waters off northern Australia. The new genus {{is closely related}} to the genus Pontocaris Bate, 1888, but it is remarkable in the modifications of the dactyls of the fifth pcreiopods, a mechanism attaching the branchiostogite to the thoracic sternites and the presence of a probable stridulating mechanism on the carpus of the third pereiopod...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{geographical}} {{range of a}} deep-water <b>crangonid</b> <b>shrimp,</b> Aegaeon rathbuni (De Man, 1918), is extended north in the Northwestern Pacific from Taiwan to Boso Peninsula, central Japan. Description and illustrations are given in order to supplement the taxanomic information of this species. Close examination has shown that A. rathbuni has minute tegumental scales on the body integument. This discovery represents the first certain example of the crangonid species having tegumental scales. A preliminary examination of selected species from Aegaeon and the two closely related genera, Pontocaris and Parapontocaris, has been made, {{and the presence of}} the tegumental scales is confirmed only in the congeneric A. lacaze...|$|R
40|$|Philocheras breviflagella, a {{new species}} of <b>crangonid</b> <b>shrimp,</b> is {{described}} and illustrated {{on the basis of}} a single ovigerous female collected from O'ahu, Hawai'i, at subtidal depth. The new species is most similar to P. sabsechota (Kemp, 1911) known with certainty only from the Andaman Islands, eastern Indian Ocean. It differs from P. sabsechota in several features, including the much narrower rostrum, the unarmed second lateral carina of the carapace, and the truncate posterior margin of the uropodal exopod. Other differences include the shorter fingers (each with an elongate unguis) of the second pereopod, and medially notched posterodorsal margins of the second and fourth abdominal somites. The new species is the first representative of the genus found to occur in the central Pacific...|$|R
40|$|Winter {{flounder}} (Pseudopleuronectes americanus) stock complexes {{have been}} heavily exploited {{in the recent}} past, consequently decreasing abundances to record low levels. Despite management efforts to reduce further stock losses due to fishing mortality, discrete sub-populations of flounder continue to decrease {{for reasons that are}} unknown. Predation on the early life history stages of flatfish is recognized as the most important factor regulating year-class formation and recruitment. Winter flounder eggs and juveniles possess few morphological qualities that benefit the species in predator defense. Subsequently, survival of the early life stages of winter flounder depends on the effectiveness of spatial and temporal refuges in minimizing epibenthic predation. There is circumstantial evidence that increasing seasonal water temperature in several northern-temperate estuaries compromise these prey refuges, thereby exposing early-stage flounder to intense predator-induced mortality. The objectives of this study were twofold: (1) identify the importance of sand shrimp (Crangon septemspinosa) as a predators of winter flounder eggs and post-settlement juveniles; and (2) assess the implications of increasing water temperature on predator-prey dynamics and the regulation of flounder year-class strength and recruitment. Immunological assays were used in this study to analyze the stomach contents of field-collected C. septemspinosa. Accordingly, the first tangible evidence is given indicating that <b>crangonid</b> <b>shrimp</b> are predators of winter flounder eggs and juveniles in natural populations. By extrapolating results from immunoassays, C. septemspinosa were projected to consume 34. 3...|$|R
40|$|Distribution and {{abundance}} of species of Crangonidae and Glyphocrangonidae in the Mexican deep-waters of the Gulf of Mexico were analyzed through six research cruises onboard of the R/V Justo Sierra of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México using an otter trawl in a depth range of 300 – 1200 m. We collected two and five {{species of the}} Crangonidae and Glyphocrangonidae families, respectively. We provide information about its depth and geographic distribution, abundance, frequency of occurrence and size structure. Glyphocrangon, composed of five species (G. aculeata, G. alispina, G. haematonotus, G. longleyi and G. spinicauda), {{was the most common}} and abundant component during the benthic trawls with a total of 1125 individuals. The family Crangonidae recorded only one genus and two species (Parapontocaris caribbaea and P. vicina) with 21 individuals. A taxonomic key for these <b>crangonid</b> and glyphocrangonid <b>shrimps</b> of the Gulf of Mexico is also provided...|$|R
