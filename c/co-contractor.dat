25|$|The {{decision}} {{to build a}} bridge across the Bosphorus was taken in 1957 by Prime Minister Adnan Menderes. For the structural engineering work, a contract was signed with the British firm Freeman Fox & Partners in 1968. The bridge was designed by the British civil engineers Gilbert Roberts, William Brown and Michael Parsons, who also designed the Humber Bridge, Severn Bridge, and Forth Road Bridge. Construction started in February 1970 and ceremonies were attended by President Cevdet Sunay and Prime Minister Süleyman Demirel. The bridge was built by the Turkish firm Enka Construction & Industry Co. along with the <b>co-contractors</b> Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company (England) and Hochtief AG (Germany). Thirty-five engineers and 400 men worked on the project.|$|R

30|$|In France, in {{the market}} sector (excluding {{agriculture}} and finance) 95 % of enterprises are microenterprises employing 19 % of all employees, while only 217 enterprises gather 31 % of the employees and achieve {{a third of the}} merchant value added (Beguin et al. 2012). In such a concentrated productive organization, the network relationships between small and big companies are a key to the success and, first of all, to the survival of small companies. The development of such network relationship depends on the ability of small businesses to increase their knowledge capital, that is, the scientific and technical competencies they produce and absorb, in order to become of interest for the big company and integrate their productive value chain (as a sub or <b>co-contractor</b> for example). In the matter of building knowledge capital, small businesses usually record weak results (see Laperche and Liu 2013).|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to {{establish}} a relationship between the unpredictability theory and the contractual liability, from both theoretical and practical point of view. Usually, the unpredictability is invoked by way of defense by the debtor, refusing to perform the excessively onerous obligation. However the unpredictability theory shall apply also to the hypothesis of a performed obligation, by way of main action, depending on more factors: the nature of the agreement, investigating the attitude of the party affected by the unpredictability. Observing the conditions and the effects of these two ways of invoking the unpredictability will form the objectives of the present study. The debtor of the excessively onerous, in order to avoid the contractual liability, shall nevertheless perform such obligation, by carrying along some additional costs. If subsequently, the creditor shall refuse to revise the agreement and implicitly, to reimburse the exorbitant costs, the debtor will have to raise the unpredictability by way of action, in order to recover the exorbitant costs in performing the obligation. In such case, the unpredictability is accompanied by another legal issue: the contractual liability of the <b>co-contractor</b> of the party affected by unpredictability...|$|E

40|$|International audienceDuring {{the last}} decade, {{the market in}} private death {{insurance}} (pre-paid funeral plans) has developped relatively suddenly in France, {{as has been the}} case in other Western countries (UK, US, Australia in recent decades). This paper analyses the concrete fabric of the agencements by the various stakeholders operating in this new market. The study focuses on the "pre-paid contract" as the key market device which governs contractual arrangements and essential problems of coordination (Beckert, 2009) : value formation (price, payment, capitalization), regulation of competition (the terms of agreement between the <b>co-contractors),</b> organisation of cooperation (the division of labour and tasks between the insurance company and the funeral operator). By observing the competition in supply, and the subsequent competitive alliances formed between the key economic actors, it examines the specific properties of the various pre-paid contracts and particularly {{the way in which they}} fix the links and interdependencies between the market protagonists...|$|R

40|$|Since the mid- 1970 s, ozone {{concentrations}} in California’s South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) have been higher on weekends than on weekdays despite assumed lower emissions on weekends than on weekdays. The {{objective of the}} National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) weekend effect project, performed by <b>co-contractors</b> Sonoma Technology, Inc. (STI) and the Desert Research Institute (DRI), is to conduct {{a study of the}} possible cause(s) of higher weekend ozone compared to weekday ozone in the SoCAB. In Phase I of this three-phase project, STI acquired emissions activity and meteorological data in order to establish data needs and priorities for Phase II field study data acquisition/measurements and worked with DRI to refine hypotheses for further testing in Phases II and III. In this report, STI summarizes available emissions data. In order to identify existing sources of emissions activity data, literature reviews were conducted and discussions with several government agencies and industry experts were held. Significant effort was expended for on-road mobile sources since these are the single largest source of emissions in the SoCAB. During Phase II of the project, STI will compile data {{that can be used in}} Phase III to assess possible weekend effects. Data to be collected include traffic data on surface streets an...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRisk {{allocation}} in contracts is {{an important}} issue for both economics and law. It questions the theorerical, methodological, empirical foundations of economic and legal analysis. It also offers a valuable ground for comparative legal-economic inquiry. The article aims at providing some insights into that general perpective, and proceeds with an articulation of theoretical and empirical analysis. The paper first offers a critical analysis of some key economic basis hypothesis on law, contract law and legal institutions, notably the courts. It concentrates on various componants of the New Institutional Economics stream that are {{something to do with the}} notion of contractual incompletedness. The emphasis is put on two central issues : the contract-institutions relations, and the scope of incompleteness as a guide for empirical research into the economic dimensions of contract law. The second part of the article compares and evaluates the significance of the economic concept of incompletedness and theFrench legal notion of imprévision, which relates to a notion that the administrative courts have set-up to decide cases in which the occurrence of unforeseen events affects the contractual equilibria built ex ante. The analysis then moves toward the research of a legal and empirical translation of uncertainty of the future. The article argues that positive legal provisions in contract law enable <b>co-contractors</b> to set-up a framework in which the consequences unforeseen events can be adressed. Legal provisions such as those which relate to conditional duties, aleatory contracts, force majeure, fortious events, price revision, hardship, are examples of tools that allow a significant amount of previsibility in contractual relations, particularilly long-term contracts. We then offer an empirical analysis of a specific legal notion : the imprévision. The analysis is based on legal data, namely the French Conseil d'Etat decisions that deal with a request for compensation by the State of the economic consequences of the occurrence of unforeseen events for the suppliers. A descriptive statistical analysis is associated to a study of the doctrine that the State officials adress to contracting officers; a comparison of price determination provisions under American procurement and French law of “marchés publics” is then made. L'allocation des risques inhérents à l'exécution d'obligations dans des accords dont la temporalité est longue est une question importante, notamment pour l'économie. Or, à cet égard, il est significatif de constater que les entrées consacrées au droit administratif dans l'Encyclopedia of Law and Economics ne font pas mention des contrats administratifs, et que les entrées relatives au droit des contrats ne renvoient jamais au droit administratif. On ne peut que signaler, à ce propos, l'originalité de l'ouvrage de microéconomie des marchés publics et de la réglementation de J. -J Laffont et J. Tirole (1993). Quelles conclusions tirer de ce constat ? De notre point de vue, deux hypothèses peuvent être avancées : soit les économistes se désintéressent des contrats administratifs, soit ils les intègrent implicitement dans le même moule que les contrats de droit privé. Nous estimons que la deuxième hypothèse est la plus plausible, et nous souhaitons l'explorer ici en réfléchissant sur le fait de savoir si le droit positif des contrats privés et administratifs rend possible l'application de mêmes catégories d'analyse en matière d'allocation des risques. Cette question appelera naturellement une réflexion sur la signification et la portée empirique de la notion économique d'incomplétude des contrats...|$|R
