5|$|Thai {{architect}} Sumet Jumsai {{designed the}} Robot Building for the Bank of Asia, which {{was acquired by}} United Overseas Bank in 2005. He had been asked by the Bank of Asia's directors to design a building that reflected the modernization and <b>computerization</b> of banking and found inspiration in his son's toy robot.|$|E
5|$|The Robot Building, {{located in}} the Sathorn {{business}} district of Bangkok, Thailand, houses United Overseas Bank's Bangkok headquarters. It was designed for the Bank of Asia by Sumet Jumsai to reflect the <b>computerization</b> of banking; its architecture is a reaction against neoclassical and high-tech postmodern architecture. The building's features, such as progressively receding walls, antennas, and eyes, contribute to its robotic appearance and to its practical function. Completed in 1986, the building {{is one of the}} last examples of modern architecture in Bangkok.|$|E
5|$|Starting in the mid-1950s, new car {{introductions}} in {{the fall}} once again became an anticipated event, as all dealers would reveal the models for the upcoming year each October. In this era before the popularization of <b>computerization,</b> {{the primary source of}} information on new models was the dealer. The idea was originally suggested in the 1930s by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression, as a way of stimulating the economy by creating demand. The idea was reintroduced by President Dwight Eisenhower for the same reasons, and this method of introducing next year's models in the preceding autumn lasted well into the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Strom also {{resisted}} calling {{an early}} election {{to give his}} government a fresh mandate, despite Hamilton's impassioned advocacy for this course of action. He was no more positive towards Anderson's proposals for a radical overhaul of the party, including the <b>computerization</b> of political data (such as voting trends, demographic shifts, and polling results) and the purchase of an office building to make the party a profit and free it from the need for fundraising. The ideas that Strom did not reject outright were referred to committees and study groups where they were watered down or shelved.|$|E
25|$|But since <b>computerization</b> of the business, {{membership}} {{has dropped to}} 40,000 working printers and 35,000 retirees.|$|E
25|$|The {{proliferation}} of autopilot {{systems and the}} increased <b>computerization</b> of operations on a ship's bridge lessen the need for helmsmen standing watch in open waters.|$|E
25|$|Murfreesboro is {{the home}} of a Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP). It is part of an {{initiative}} by the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide mail order prescriptions to veterans using <b>computerization</b> at strategic locations throughout the United States. It is located {{on the campus of the}} Alvin C. York Veterans Hospital.|$|E
25|$|Dallas {{also has}} a VA {{hospital}} in the southern portion of the city, the Dallas Veterans Affairs Medical Center. The center {{is home to a}} Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP), part of an initiative by the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide mail-order prescriptions to veterans using <b>computerization</b> at strategic locations throughout the United States.|$|E
25|$|While all modernized economies were rapidly {{moving to}} <b>computerization</b> after 1965, the USSR fell {{further and further}} behind. Moscow's {{decision}} to copy the IBM 360 of 1965 proved a decisive mistake for it locked scientists into an antiquated system {{they were unable to}} improve. They had enormous difficulties in manufacturing the necessary chips reliably and in quantity, in programming workable and efficient programs, in coordinating entirely separate operations, and in providing support to computer users.|$|E
25|$|The {{activities}} of typesetting, page layout, {{the production of}} negatives, plates from the negatives and, for hardbacks, the preparation of brasses for the spine legend and Imprint are now all computerized. Prepress <b>computerization</b> evolved mainly in about {{the last twenty years}} of the 20th century. If the work is to be distributed electronically, the final files are saved in formats appropriate to the target operating systems of the hardware used for reading. These may include PDF files.|$|E
25|$|Toyota {{redesigned}} {{this series}} {{from the ground}} up {{for the first time since}} the V30 and XV10. Through efficiency gains such as increased <b>computerization,</b> and by having the XV30 ride on the K platform introduced with the Toyota Highlander (XU20) of 2000, Toyota expedited the XV30 production development stage to 26months, down from 36months with the XV20. As a consequence, Toyota claimed the XV30 to have cost 30percent less to design and develop than its predecessor. XV30 also had increased parts content over the XV20, but did not cost any more to manufacture.|$|E
25|$|A typical {{central office}} may have tens of {{thousands}} of pairs of wires that appear on terminal blocks called the main distribution frame (MDF). A component of the MDF is protection: fuses or other devices that protect the switch from lightning, shorts with electric power lines, or other foreign voltages. In a typical telephone company, a large database tracks information about each subscriber pair and the status of each jumper. Before <b>computerization</b> of Bell System records in the 1980s, this information was handwritten in pencil in accounting ledger books.|$|E
25|$|Refund Banker scheme {{introduced}} in 2007 eliminated the scope for {{corruption in the}} Refunds of Excessive Tax collected by the Department. Introduction of E-filing of Taxes and effective implementation of Permanent Account Number (PAN) are some revolutionary steps that reduced the scope for corruption at all levels while improving {{the efficiency of the}} whole system. Use of Centralised Processing Center setup in 2010 at Bangalore of the Income Tax Department reduced unnecessary delays in processing returns. These <b>computerization</b> initiatives have freed up the human resources in the department which are largely responsible for higher revenue collections.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, {{the school}} moved towards <b>computerization</b> and renovations {{occurred}} around the campus. The biggest change during this era {{was the creation}} of an on-campus parking lot and the closure of Bancroft Street, which previously divided the campus into two separate sections. In 1997, the school celebrated its 75th anniversary. The school continues to grow in the new millennium, and is embarking on an extensive building campaign which calls for most of the school being demolished and rebuilt to meet modern standards of building codes and architectural tastes. The school will also feature the latest in technology made readily available to its students and faculty.|$|E
25|$|It was {{successfully}} negotiated that beef from Wales {{was allowed to}} be exported to the Dutch market, which had formerly been an important market for Northern Irish beef. Of two approved export establishments in the United Kingdom in 1999, one was in Scotland – an establishment to which live beef was supplied from Northern Ireland. As the incidence of BSE was very low in Northern Ireland – only six cases of BSE by 1999 – {{partly due to the}} early adoption of an advanced herd tagging and <b>computerization</b> system in the region, calls were made to remove the EU ban on exports with regard to Northern Irish beef.|$|E
500|$|Marc Miller, an {{original}} creator of Traveller, {{wrote in a}} letter of introduction to this game, [...] "I've always said that Traveller would make the perfect computer game for the same two reasons that it's a great role-playing game: rules and background. The background, and its wealth of detail, will naturally capture the interest of players. But it's the simplicity of the rules which makes the <b>computerization</b> possible." [...] After Paragon Software acquired the video game rights to Traveller from Game Designers Workshop, Miller contributed [...] "generous support and research material" [...] to Paragon's development efforts.|$|E
500|$|Mustaine {{pointed out}} that four of the album's 12 tracks are [...] "fast, hard and crunchy". Referring to the musical {{direction}} of the album, MTV's writer P.R. Flack noted that [...] "The Disintegrators" [...] and [...] "FFF" [...] were rooted in the thrash metal genre, and ranked them among the fastest tracks on the record. Neil Arnold of Metal Forces highlighted the tune [...] "Vortex", which according to him, features some of the album's best guitar work. However, a number of songs, particularly [...] "I'll Get Even" [...] and [...] "Use the Man", carried a more rock-oriented sound, which contributed to the album's diverse style. Lyrically, the album {{does not have a}} distinct subject matter, but focuses on numerous themes instead. [...] "She-Wolf" [...] tells of a [...] "wicked temptress with mystic lips and lusting eyes", while [...] "Mastermind" [...] has been stated by Mustaine as being about [...] "the <b>computerization</b> of the world." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{writing a}} {{biography}} on the author, Brian Stableford placed several of Dick's short stories {{in a context}} that established {{their relationship to the}} author's personal hardships. [...] "...it always seemed to him [...] that his career was a catalogue of undeserved disappointments and the record of his published work a travesty of his true ambitions." [...] The personal problems which Dick struggled throughout his life provided fuel for several of the anxiety driven themes for his short stories. In Dick's early work, Stableford highlighted recurring themes in those most popular. These included paranoid suspicions; the dangerous hostility of [...] "seemingly innocent entities"; and [...] "the mechanization of the environment and the <b>computerization</b> of political decision-making". Stories in which androids and robots are a danger to the protagonist include [...] "Autofac", [...] "Colony", and Vulcan's Hammer. However, [...] "The Last of the Masters", Stableford contends, was an exception to Dick's common dystopic portrayals of technology, given Stableford's interpretation of Bors as an altruist, who was [...] "benign" [...] in its role.|$|E

Gordon and {{his fellow}} Senators succeeded in passing [...] or the Amending the Election Modernization Act {{but it was too}} late since it was passed three months before the {{elections}} but since the law was passed, the elections for the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao Regional Governor and Vice-Governor later in August 2008 it will be used for the test-run for <b>computerization</b> and the general elections in 2010 for the nationwide <b>computerization</b> of elections.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{some recent}} {{research}} which tries {{to assess the}} impact of the Internet on profitability. It remains unclear what the total effect of <b>computerization</b> is on the relationship between investments and profits. Some argue that, in reality, <b>computerization</b> by itself does not alter the cost structure of products very much. Others argue, that <b>computerization</b> both enables a much faster turnover of capital, with great productivity gains and fewer employees, and permits entrepreneurs to set up business with computers at a much lower start-up cost than before. Perhaps the main effect of the internet relevant to business is that it has gigantically enlarged the possibilities for market access on a global scale: businesses set up for internet sales can reach vastly more customers in much less time. [...] The proof of that is, that purchases via the internet have constantly increased, often at the expense of ordinary street shops. One of the analytical problems is that the relative importance of computers, and their potential financial impact, differs considerably between different kinds of business.|$|E
2500|$|To date, the Silliman Library {{remains as}} one of the biggest {{libraries}} in the Philippines. In 2008, the Silliman University Library System was given the [...] "Outstanding Library Award" [...] by the Philippine Association of Academic and Research Librarians (PAARL) for its growing collection and ongoing <b>computerization</b> program.|$|E
2500|$|A [...] {{project for}} <b>computerization</b> and {{networking}} of 1.55 lakh post offices {{across the country}} is being currently implemented by the government. Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the project involves a central server enabled integrated, modular and scalable solution for all operations of the Department of Posts including Core banking and Insurance solutions in all departmental post offices.|$|E
2500|$|Nasal vowels carry tone as well, {{resulting}} in a two diacritics on vowels with high tone: ą́ (presenting problems for <b>computerization).</b> [...] Recently, de Reuse (2006) has found that Western Apache also has a mid tone, which he indicates with a macron diacritic ¯, as in ō, ǭ. [...] In Chiricahua, a falling tone can occur on a syllabic n: n̂.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2001, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo {{appointed}} him acting Secretary of Transportation and Communications, {{where he served}} until July 2002. [...] Among Alvarez's achievements were {{the adoption of the}} light railway expansion program, improvement of the Philippine National Railway, and <b>computerization</b> of the department and attached agencies. He also spearheaded the slogan [...] "OKS na OKS sa DOTC" [...] which means [...] "Organisado, Kalinisan at Seguridad".|$|E
2500|$|The {{report also}} {{highlighted}} several initiatives the WJC had taken since 2004 to improve financial management, including [...] "the {{creation of an}} audit committee and the position of chief financial officer, the <b>computerization</b> of all financial records, {{the creation of an}} employee handbook outlining official procedures and policies, the implementation of travel and reimbursement procedures, {{and the creation of a}} new fund-raising entity (the WJC Foundation)." ...|$|E
2500|$|During his {{political}} career, he frequently waged progressive campaigns {{against the current}} of a sociologically conservative France. [...] He advocated decentralization through regionalization; reallocation of resources from the Concorde program to the Airbus; an end to nuclear testing; reform of the grandes écoles; and <b>computerization.</b> He refused to cooperate with Georges Marchais's Communist Party. He seemed unable to play political power games. His centrist strategy was never successful and eventually brought down his party.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, the {{reduction}} of the [...] "digital divide", advances in Internet connectivity, increases in uses for the Internet, and better education {{on the use of the}} Internet led to further increases in Internet usage. Between 1990 and 1997, the percentage of households in the United States owning computers increased from 15% to 35%. Information and communications technology progressed from a luxury to a necessity. The shift to an economy based on <b>computerization</b> is known as the Information Age.|$|E
2500|$|MacNeish {{added to}} the {{understanding}} and analysis of archaeological materials through the championing of the interdisciplinary approach. [...] In addition, {{his work on the}} standardization and <b>computerization</b> of lithic-attribute terminology enabled more sophisticated statistical analysis and generalization of the results. [...] His ceramic analysis helped to reevaluate the prehistory of the Iroquois, disputing the idea that they had developed elsewhere and then migrated into their historic territory. [...] His method of analysis demonstrated continuity between historic period groups and prehistoric complexes in the same areas.|$|E
2500|$|Research by the Oxford Martin School {{showed that}} {{employees}} engaged in [...] "tasks following well-defined procedures {{that can easily}} be performed by sophisticated algorithms" [...] {{are at risk of}} displacement. The study, published in 2013, shows that automation can affect both skilled and unskilled work and both high and low-paying occupations; however, low-paid physical occupations are most at risk. However, according to a study published in McKinsey Quarterly in 2015 the impact of <b>computerization</b> in most cases is not replacement of employees but automation of portions of the tasks they perform.|$|E
2500|$|In 1985 Ben Shneiderman {{suggested}} [...] "color coding of text strings {{to suggest}} meaning". The Live Parsing Editor (LEXX) {{written for the}} VM operating system for the <b>computerization</b> of the Oxford English Dictionary in 1985 {{was one of the}} first to use color syntax highlighting. Its live parsing capability allowed user-supplied parsers to be added to the editor, for text, programs, data file, etc. On microcomputers, MacPascal 1.0 (October 10, 1985) recognized Pascal syntax as it was typed and used font changes (e.g., bold for keywords) to highlight syntax on the monochrome compact Macintosh and automatically indented code to match its structure.|$|E
2500|$|Paul Dourish is a {{professor}} of informatics, computer science, and anthropology at UC Irvine. Some classes Dourish teaches are , , and [...] His Ubiquitous Computing and Interaction class focuses on how humans obtain information and interact using computers. Dourish's Socian Analysis of <b>Computerization</b> class focuses on how the internet, information, and technology affect our everyday lives. Finally, Dourish's Research in Computer-Human Interaction class examines the interactions between users and their devices and can be applied to either a person theoretically studying the field to write a dissertation or to a student wanting to apply these ideas to their own products.|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} {{football}} development, {{he was responsible}} in 2006 of the [...] "Win in Africa with Africa" [...] program, whose idea emerged after a meeting in 2005 between the President of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki and Sepp Blatter so that the whole continent would benefit from the first FIFA World Cup held in Africa. With a budget of $70 million voted in the FIFA Congress in Munich in 2006, this program will enable the construction of more than fifty synthetic fields, the <b>computerization</b> of players’ registration, the reorganization of the formats of many local leagues {{and the establishment of}} sports management courses in Egypt, Senegal and South Africa.|$|E
2500|$|In 1980 Servan-Schreiber {{published}} his second bestseller, Le Défi mondial (The Global Challenge), {{devoted to the}} technological rise of Japan through <b>computerization.</b> He served once again as shadow councilor to his close acquaintances François Mitterrand and Valéry Giscard d'Estaing; his friendship with the latter {{went back to the}} École Polytechnique. However, his initiative to create a center for the promotion of information technology in France turned into a money pit and closed down in 1986. [...] He then moved to Pittsburgh where he had his four sons (David, Émile, Franklin and Édouard) educated at Carnegie Mellon University, a leader in computer science. [...] Servan-Schreiber directed the university's international relations.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} the Second World War, the IRS was {{handling}} sixty million tax returns each year, using a combination of mechanical desk calculators, accounting machines and pencil and paper forms. In 1948 punch card equipment was used. The first trial of a computer system for income tax processing was in 1955, when an IBM 650 installed at Kansas City processed 1.1 million returns. The IRS was authorized to proceed with <b>computerization</b> in 1959, [...] and purchased IBM 1401 and IBM 7070 systems for local and regional data processing centers. The Social Security Number was used for taxpayer identification starting in 1965. By 1967, all returns were processed by computer and punched card data entry was phased out.|$|E
2500|$|In ICD-11 each disease entity {{will have}} {{definitions}} that give key descriptions and guidance {{on what the}} meaning of the entity/category is in human-readable terms, to guide users. This is an advancement over ICD-10, which had only title headings. The Definitions have a standard structure according to a template with standard definition templates and further features exemplified in a [...] "Content Model". The Content Model is a structured framework that captures the knowledge that underpins the definition of an ICD entity. [...] The Content Model therefore allows <b>computerization</b> (with links to ontologies and SNOMED CT). Each ICD entity can be seen from different dimensions or [...] "parameters". For example, there are currently 13 defined main parameters in the Content Model (see below) to describe a category in ICD.|$|E
