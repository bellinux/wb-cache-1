5|$|The Oxford Olympics Study 2016 {{estimates}} the outturn {{cost of the}} Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics at USD 6.8 billion in 2015-dollars and cost overrun at 2% in real terms. This includes sports-related costs only, that is, (i) operational <b>costs</b> <b>incurred</b> by the organizing committee {{for the purpose of}} staging the Games, e.g., expenditures for technology, transportation, workforce, administration, security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services, and (ii) direct capital <b>costs</b> <b>incurred</b> by the host city and country or private investors to build the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast center, and media and press center, which are required to host the Games. Indirect capital costs are not included, such as for road, rail, or airport infrastructure, or for hotel upgrades or other business investment incurred in preparation for the Games but not directly related to staging the Games. The Beijing Olympics' cost of USD 6.8 billion compares with costs of USD 4.6 billion for Rio 2016 and USD 15 billion for London 2012. Average cost for the Summer Games since 1960 is USD 5.2 billion.|$|E
5|$|As {{the three}} {{suspects}} {{had been killed}} while preparing an act of terrorism, the court rejected the families' claims for damages, {{as well as their}} claim for expenses incurred at the inquest. The court did order the British government to pay the applicants' <b>costs</b> <b>incurred</b> during the proceedings in Strasbourg. The government initially suggested it would not pay, and there was discussion in parliament of the UK withdrawing from the ECHR. It paid the costs on 24 December 1995, within days of the three-month deadline which had been set by the court.|$|E
5|$|During construction, {{the need}} for new water and {{electrical}} supply lines arose. Because these were not factored into the original $65million cost, another $5million was appropriated from existing capital funds. Another $5million was later required to pay for cleaning contaminated soil, increased sub-contractor pricing, additional labor <b>costs</b> <b>incurred</b> by delays caused by snow and ice, and upgrades including the guitar-shaped scoreboard. The Sounds ownership team contributed $2million toward the cost of the scoreboard. These and other additional expenditures, such as a $9.5million greenway, $5.6million for street paving, sidewalks, and electrical work, and $3.6million in flood prevention, brought the total construction cost of the stadium to $56million and the total cost of the project to $91million.|$|E

5|$|Karnan {{was filmed}} with an {{estimated}} budget of 4 million (valued at about US$840 000.84 in 1964). The high cost of the film was attributed to the transportation <b>costs</b> <b>incurred</b> to move chariots from Chennai to Kurukshetra, where the war sequences were filmed. Permission from the government was sought, cavalry and infantry from the Indian Army {{were brought to the}} locations at Kurukshetra and the first rows of the charging armies on horses and elephants had soldiers from the Indian Army. The battle scenes were shot with troupes of the 61 Cavalry Regiment, using 80 elephants, 400 horses and three cameras. Other scenes were shot at palaces in Jaipur. Shooting for Karnan also took place at the Bangalore Palace in the Cantonment area, making it the first film to be shot there.|$|E

The specific state funding quotas were: Victoria £2,500, New South Wales £2,500, Western Australia £2,600, Queensland £1,000 and South Australia £450. There was a concern as to not impact on the fund raising required by the Commonwealth Games appeal. Several reports of the Games highlight the importance of large spectator attendance and 'passing the hat' around in the fund raising efforts. The total cost at the Games was £11,717 with a surplus of £2,089.|$|E

5|$|In November 1793, Shelby {{received}} a letter from another of Genêt's agents, Charles Delpeau. He confided to Shelby that he had been sent to secure supplies for an expedition against Spanish holdings, and inquired whether Shelby had been instructed to arrest individuals associated with such a scheme. Three days later Shelby responded by letter, relating Jefferson's warning against aiding the French. Despite having no evidence that Shelby was party to Genêt's scheme, both Jefferson and Knox felt compelled to warn him a second time. Jefferson provided names and descriptions of the French agents believed to be in Kentucky and encouraged their arrest. Knox went a step further by suggesting Kentucky would be reimbursed for any <b>costs</b> <b>incurred</b> resisting the French by force, should such action become necessary. General Anthony Wayne informed him that his cavalry was at the state's disposal. Arthur St. Clair, governor of the American Northwest Territory, also admonished Shelby against cooperation with Genêt.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{the film}} sold the most tickets of any {{film in the}} {{franchise}} until 2009's Star Trek, and it remains the highest-grossing film of the franchise worldwide adjusted for inflation, but Paramount considered its gross disappointing compared to expectations and marketing. The Motion Pictures budget of $46million, including <b>costs</b> <b>incurred</b> during PhaseII production, was the largest for any film made within the United States up to that time. David Gerrold estimated before its release that the film would have to gross {{two to three times}} its budget to be profitable for Paramount. The studio faulted Roddenberry's script rewrites and creative direction for the plodding pace and disappointing gross. While the performance of The Motion Picture convinced the studio to back a (cheaper) sequel, Roddenberry was forced out of its creative control. Harve Bennett and Nicholas Meyer would produce and direct , which received better reviews (becoming a fan favorite) and continued the franchise. With the successful revival of the Star Trek brand on the big screen setting an example, Hollywood increasingly turned to 1960s television series for material.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{plans were}} for twenty four cannons, captured from the French army at the Battle of Waterloo, {{to be installed}} around the base. In 1818 one brass and 15 iron cannons were transported from the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich to Exeter Quay, but they were never transported to the monument. After years of storage at Exeter ten were sunk into the ground as bollards, and the brass gun sold in 1837 for £64 to cover the storage <b>costs</b> <b>incurred</b> by the local corporation. In 1890, when four guns were requested for the monument {{as part of a}} restoration project, they were found to be naval cannons cast in Scotland dating from 1789, and never used at the Battle of Waterloo. Four cannons were eventually installed in 1910, surrounding the monument, but these were removed during the Second World War (1939–1945) for scrap metal to help the war effort. The need for scrap metal fell and they were eventually buried at Watchet. The one cannon remaining at Exeter was brought to the monument in 1977 and finally installed in 1984.|$|E
40|$|A study about {{trend of}} <b>cost</b> <b>incurred</b> in paddy {{production}} had been conducted at Kemubu Agricultural Development Authority (KADA). The {{objective of this}} study is to analyze the trend of cost in paddy production.

All the data collected from secondary data from year 2004 - 2013 include <b>cost</b> <b>incurred,</b> paddy production and planted area. From the result of an analysis, the conclusion can be made is the cost of production per hectare increase every year. On the other hand, the total <b>cost</b> <b>incurred</b> in total planted area shows a fluctuated because the planted area are not consistent each year. By referring to the result of this study, it can be conclude that the cost of paddy production shows it directly affect the paddy production.
