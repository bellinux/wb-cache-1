25|$|The G36 {{employs a}} large number of lightweight, {{corrosion-resistant}} synthetic materials in its design; the receiver housing, stock, trigger group (including the fire control selector and firing mechanism parts), magazine well, handguard and <b>carry</b> <b>handle</b> are all made of a carbon fiber-reinforced polyamide. The receiver has an integrated steel barrel trunnion (with locking recesses) and a nylon 66 steel reinforced receiver.|$|E

25|$|The G36 is a selective-fire 5.56 mm assault rifle, firing from {{a closed}} rotary bolt. The G36 has a {{conventional}} layout and a modular component design. Common to all variants of the G36 family are: {{the receiver and}} buttstock assembly, bolt carrier group with bolt and the return mechanism and guide rod. The receiver contains the barrel, <b>carry</b> <b>handle</b> with integrated sights, trigger group with pistol grip, handguard and magazine socket.|$|E
25|$|The SS2 is {{an upgrade}} of the Pindad SS1, being a {{licensed}} {{version of the}} FN FNC. The SS2's flash suppressor is based on that of the Colt M16A2, {{and it has a}} reciprocating charging handle {{that can be used for}} forward assist, with the front sight being based on the AK rifles. The carrying handle and detachable rear sight is placed on top of Picatinny railings. Most of the SS2 rifle variants can have its <b>carry</b> <b>handle</b> removed in order to gain access to its picatinny railings to install various optics.|$|E
25|$|The export {{versions}} have {{a single}} telescopic sight with a 1.5× magnification and an aiming reticle fixed at 300 m. All rifles are adapted to use the Hensoldt NSA 80 third-generation night sight, which clamps into the G36 <b>carry</b> <b>handle</b> adapter {{in front of the}} optical sight housing and mates with the rifle's standard optical sight. The sighting bridge also functions as a carrying handle and features auxiliary open sights molded on top of the handle that consist of a forward blade and rear notch, but these can only be used with the reflex sight removed, as in the G36V. The optical sight system is produced by Hensoldt AG (a subsidiary of Carl Zeiss AG).|$|E
5000|$|The DIO {{promotes}} the KH2002 as a [...] "low-recoil, highly accurate, lightweight" [...] weapon, with [...] "modular construction for easy maintenance" [...] and a rotating bolt locking mechanism, presumably designed to facilitate ambidextrous firing, protected under a <b>carrying</b> <b>handle</b> {{that contains the}} rear sight. The <b>carrying</b> <b>handle</b> {{can also be used}} to mount optical or night sights.|$|R

2500|$|The second {{generation}} MSSR {{was created by}} removing the forward portion of the <b>carry</b> <b>handle</b> and attaching the Tri-mount directly {{to the top of}} the upper receiver. [...] The Tasco scope and scope rings were attached to the Tri-mount, which provided a lower scope-to-bore height. [...] The Delta HBAR cheek piece was no longer required and was removed. [...] The M16A1 front sight base was removed and replaced with a DPMS gas block. [...] The barrel was changed to a DPMS Ultra Match barrel with a 1 in 8" [...] RH twist, and the M16A1 stock and pistol grip were replaced with A2 versions.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{generation}} MSSR was deployed in 1996 as an M16A1 with a Tasco variable 3-9 x 40mm rubber-coated scope on a DPMS Tri-mount atop the <b>carry</b> <b>handle.</b> [...] This required a Delta HBAR cheek {{piece on the}} stock to align the operator's eye with the elevated scope position. [...] The standard handguards were replaced with a free-floating aluminum forearm, and a Harris folding bipod {{was attached to the}} underside of the forearm. [...] The standard M16A1 barrel was replaced with a free-floated 24" [...] (68cm) DPMS Heavy Stainless Steel Ultra Match barrel with a 1 in 8.5" [...] right-hand twist, with an M16A1 front sight base. [...] A J match trigger was installed.|$|E

2500|$|Based on the G36, Heckler & Koch {{also created}} the {{semi-automatic}} SL8 rifle and the straight-pull, bolt-action R8, which are {{offered to the}} civilian sport shooting markets. The SL8 is substantially different from the G36, it has a modified receiver and a thumbhole stock with a cheek rest, which is integral with the trigger group. The SL8 has a heavy profile, extended, [...] barrel {{that does not have}} a flash hider or bayonet lug. The rifle uses a 10-round single-stack magazine and an extended top rail used to mount a wide variety of Picatinny-standard optics. Mounted to the rail are a set of iron sights with a hooded foresight and adjustable flip rear aperture. The SL8 can also mount the G36 <b>carry</b> <b>handle</b> and integrated sight assembly, after removing the mechanical iron sights. The SL8 has an unloaded weight of 4.3kg, overall length of 980–1030mm and a trigger rated at 20 N.|$|E
2500|$|G36C (C="Compact", {{commonly}} {{mistaken for}} [...] "Commando", a term trademarked by Colt Firearms for the CAR-15): This subcarbine {{model is a}} further development of the G36K. It has a shorter barrel than the G36K, and a four-prong open-type flash hider or a birdcage type flash hider. The extremely short barrel forced designers to move the gas block closer to the muzzle end and reduce {{the length of the}} gas piston operating rod. The handguard and stock were also shortened and the fixed <b>carry</b> <b>handle</b> (with optics) was replaced with a carrying handle with an integrated MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail. The dual optical sight found on the standard G36 and G36K models was replaced with a set of rail-mounted detachable iron sights that consist of a semi-shrouded front post and a flip-up rear sight with two apertures of different diameter. The short handguard has four accessory attachment points, one of which could be used for a vertical grip. The G36C was developed and produced in January 2001.|$|E
2500|$|The AR-15's most {{distinctive}} ergonomic {{feature is the}} carrying handle and rear sight assembly {{on top of the}} receiver. This is a by-product of the original ArmaLite design, where the <b>carry</b> <b>handle</b> served to protect the charging handle. As the line of sight is [...] over the bore, the AR-15 has an inherent parallax problem. At closer ranges (typically inside 15–20 meters), the shooter must compensate by aiming high to place shots where desired. The standard AR-15 rifle has a 500mm (19.75inches) sight radius. The AR-15 uses an L-type flip, aperture rear sight and it is adjustable with two settings, 0 to 300 meters and 300 to 400 meters. The front sight is a post adjustable for elevation. The rear sight can be adjusted for windage. The sights can be adjusted with a bullet tip or pointed tool. The AR-15 can also mount a scope on the carrying handle. With the advent of the AR-15A2, a new fully adjustable rear sight was added, allowing the rear sight to be dialed in for specific range settings between 300 and 800 meters and to allow windage adjustments without the need of a tool or cartridge. Current versions such as AR-15A4 use Picatinny rails, which allows the use of various scopes and sighting devices.|$|E

50|$|Colt and Diemaco further {{improved}} on the design, {{adding a}} flat top <b>carry</b> <b>handle</b> and a further improved bipod to the {{weapon in the}} 1990s. Colt refers {{to it as the}} Model 950, but markets it as the Colt Automatic Rifle, and until their purchase by Colt, as the Diemaco LSW. Because of the Colt-Diemaco partnership on this system, it was the only weapon in their product line to feature A2 rear sights, and when modified a detachable <b>carry</b> <b>handle</b> with A2 rear sights (the majority of Diemaco's product line had A1 rear sights, and they actually developed a detachable <b>carry</b> <b>handle</b> with A1 rear sights). A maple leaf is stamped on the lower receiver of current Colt Automatic Rifles.|$|E
