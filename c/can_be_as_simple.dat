An examination <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> as a few questions, but can also include {{an examination of the}} subject's vehicle and/or luggage, more intensive questioning, or personal searches. The intensity of an examination depends on the reasonable grounds that the officer has to escalate the intensiveness of a search.|$|E

25|$|Oysters can {{be eaten}} on the half shell, raw, smoked, boiled, baked, fried, roasted, stewed, canned, pickled, steamed, or broiled, or {{used in a}} variety of drinks. Eating <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> as opening the shell and eating the contents, {{including}} juice. Butter and salt are often added. In the case of Oysters Rockefeller, preparation can be very elaborate. They are sometimes served on edible seaweed, such as brown algae.|$|E
25|$|Pet clips <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> or as {{elaborate}} as owners wish. The hair {{under the}} tail {{should always be}} kept short to keep feces from matting in the dog's curls. Most owners also keep the feet and face clipped short to prevent dirt from matting between toes, tear stains on lighter-coated poodles and food from matting around the dog's muzzle. Beyond these sanitary requirements, desired clips depend on owners' preferences. Some owners maintain a longer clip in winter than summer.|$|E
25|$|Excavation {{processes}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> as hauling {{the contaminated}} soil to a regulated landfill, {{but can also}} involve aerating the excavated material {{in the case of}} volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Recent advancements in bioaugmentation and biostimulation of the excavated material have also proven to be able to remediate semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) onsite. If the contamination affects a river or bay bottom, then dredging of bay mud or other silty clays containing contaminants (including sewage sludge with harmful microorganisms) may be conducted.|$|E

50|$|Transmission line or “choke” baluns <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{considered}} <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> {{forms of}} transmission line transformers. This type {{is sometimes called}} a “current balun”, since it ensures equal current {{on both sides of}} its output, but not necessarily equal voltage.|$|R
25|$|The {{most common}} form of degradation, however, is a {{decrease}} in polymer chain length. Mechanisms which break polymer chains are familiar to biologists because of their effect on DNA: ionizing radiation (most commonly ultraviolet light), free radicals, and oxidizers such as oxygen, ozone, and chlorine. Ozone cracking is a well-known problem affecting natural rubber for example. Plastic additives can slow these process very effectively, and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> as a UV-absorbing pigment (e.g. titanium dioxide or carbon black). Plastic shopping bags often do not include these additives so that they break down more easily as ultrafine particles of litter.|$|E
25|$|Hardware {{interrupts}} are signalled to the CPU {{using three}} inputs that encode the highest pending interrupt priority. A separate Encoder is usually required to encode the interrupts, though for systems {{that do not}} require more than three hardware interrupts it is possible to connect the interrupt signals directly to the encoded inputs at the cost of additional software complexity. The interrupt controller <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> as a 74LS148 priority encoder, or may be part of a VLSI peripheral chip such as the MC68901 Multi-Function Peripheral (used in the Atari ST range of computers and Sharp X68000), which also provided a UART, timer, and parallel I/O.|$|E
25|$|If a {{responder}} begins rendering aid, he {{must not}} leave the scene until {{it is necessary to}} call for needed medical assistance, a rescuer of equal or higher ability takes over, or continuing to give aid is unsafe. This <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> as a lack of adequate protection against potential diseases, such as vinyl, latex, or nitrile gloves to protect against blood-borne pathogens. A responder is never legally compelled to take risks to aid another person. The responder is not legally liable for any harm to the person assisted, as long as the responder acted rationally, in good faith and in accordance with their level of training.|$|E

25|$|The {{deletion}} {{of parts}} on a vehicle {{is an easy}} way for designers and vehicle owners to reduce parasitic and frontal drag of the vehicle with little cost and effort. Deletion <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> as removing an aftermarket part, or part that has been installed on the vehicle after production, or having to modify and remove an OEM part, meaning {{any part of the}} vehicle that was originally manufactured on the vehicle. Most production sports cars and high efficiency vehicles come standard with many of these deletions in order to be competitive in the automotive and race market, while others choose to keep these drag-increasing aspects of the vehicle for their visual aspects, or to fit the typical uses of their customer base.|$|E
25|$|In a Stirling engine, the {{regenerator}} is {{an internal}} heat exchanger and temporary heat store placed between the {{hot and cold}} spaces such that the working fluid passes through it first in one direction then the other, taking heat from the fluid in one direction, and returning it in the other. It <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> as metal mesh or foam, and benefits from high surface area, high heat capacity, low conductivity and low flow friction. Its function is to retain within the system that heat {{that would otherwise be}} exchanged with the environment at temperatures intermediate to the maximum and minimum cycle temperatures, thus enabling the thermal efficiency of the cycle (though not of any practical engine) to approach the limiting Carnot efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Home shrines <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> or as {{elaborate}} as the householder can afford. Large, ornate shrines can {{be purchased}} in India and countries with large Hindu minorities, like Malaysia and Singapore. They are usually made of wood and have tiled floors for statues to be placed upon. Pictures may be hung {{on the walls of}} the shrine. The top of the shrine may have a series of levels, like a gopuram tower on a temple. Each Hindu altar will have at least one oil lamp and may contain a tray with puja equipment as well. Hindus with large houses will set aside one room as their puja room, with the altar at one end of it. Some South Indians also place a shrine with pictures of their departed relatives on the right side of the room, and make offerings to them before making offerings to the gods.|$|E
