40|$|The {{repair of}} dermal tissue {{is a complex}} process of {{interconnected}} phenomena, where <b>cellular,</b> <b>chemical</b> and mechanical aspects all play a role, both in an autocrine and in a paracrine fashion. Recent experimental results have shown that transforming growth factor -β (TGF β) and tissue mechanics play roles in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation {{and the production of}} extracellular materials. We have developed a 1 D mathematical model that considers the interaction between the <b>cellular,</b> <b>chemical</b> and mechanical phenomena, allowing the combination of TGF β and tissue stress to inform the activation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. Additionally, our model incorporates the observed feature of residual stress by considering the changing zero-stress state in the formulation for effective strain. Using this model, we predict that the continued presence of TGF β in dermal wounds will produce contractures due to the persistence of myofibroblasts; in contrast, early elimination of TGF β significantly reduces the myofibroblast numbers resulting in an increase in wound size. Similar results were obtained by varying the rate at which fibroblasts differentiate to myofibroblasts and by changing the myofibroblast apoptotic rate. Taken together, the implication is that elevated levels of myofibroblasts is the key factor behind wounds healing with excessive contraction, suggesting that clinical strategies which aim to reduce the myofibroblast density may reduce the appearance of contractures. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

However, using radiolabelled precursors of the ceramide moiety, a generally diminished uptake of radioactivity into all glycosphingolipids was observed under the influence of monensin, with the exception of mono- and di-hexosylceramide.

We {{examined the effects}} of clinical and genetic factors on Michaelis-Menten reaction kinetic constants of maximum velocity (Vmax) and affinity (Km) in children 0 – 10  years old. We measured the rates of isoniazid elimination and N-acetylisoniazid production in the blood of 30 children. Since maturation effects could be non-linear, we utilized a pharmacometric approach and the artificial intelligence method, multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), to identify factors predicting NAT 2 Vmax and Km by examining clinical, genetic, and laboratory factors in toto. Isoniazid concentration predicted both Vmax and Km and superseded the contribution of NAT 2 genotype. Age non-linearly modified the NAT 2 genotype contribution until maturation at ≥ 5. 3  years.

40|$|Abstract: The enzyme-catalyzed {{conversion}} of a substrate into {{a product is}} a common reaction motif in <b>cellular</b> <b>chemical</b> systems. In the three reactions that comprise this process, the intermediate enzyme-substrate complex is usually {{much more likely to}} decay into its original constituents than to produce a product molecule. This condition makes the reaction set mathematically “stiff”. We show here how the simulation of this stiff reaction set can be dramatically speeded up relative to the standard stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) by using a recently introduced procedure called the slow-scale SSA. The speedup occurs because the slow-scale SSA explicitly simulates only the relatively rare conversion reactions, skipping over occurrences of the other two less interesting but much more frequent reactions. We describe, explain, and illustrate this simulation procedure for the isolated enzyme-substrate reaction set, and then we show how the procedure extends to the more typical case in which the enzyme-substrate reactions occur together with other reactions and species. Finally, we explain the connection between this slow-scale SSA approach and the Michaelis-Menten formula, which has long been used in deterministic chemical kinetics to describe the enzyme-substrate reaction...|$|E
