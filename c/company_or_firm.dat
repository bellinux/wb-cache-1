50|$|<b>Companies</b> <b>or</b> <b>firms</b> {{that tend}} to get {{involved}} with the strategy of predatory pricing often have the goal to place restrictions or a barrier for other new businesses from entering the applicable market. It is an unethical act which contradicts anti-trust law, attempting to establish within the market a monopoly by the imposing Company. Predatory pricing mainly occurs during price competitions in the market as it is an easy way to obfuscate the unethical and illegal act. Using this strategy, in the short term consumers will benefit and be satisfied with lower cost products. In the long run, firms often will not benefit as this strategy will continue to be used by other businesses to undercut competitors margins, causing an increase in competition within the field and facilitating major losses. This strategy is dangerous as it could be destructive to a firm in terms of losses and even lead to complete business failure.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn Denmark, Germany and {{a number}} of other {{countries}} Vocational Education and Training is based on the principle of dual education. This means that the apprentices spend one part of their education and training at a vocational school and another part in a <b>company</b> <b>or</b> <b>firm</b> directly involved in ordinary working life. The close connection to working life implies that the transition from being apprentice to becoming a trained employee is relatively easy compared to school based VET systems. The principle of dual education within VET is known worldwide for its ability to provide the labour market with highly qualified labour which is able to adjust to new and changing conditions and introduction of new technology. Furthermore skilled labour educated and trained according to dual education has a very high mobility on the labour market. Dual education secures tight connections between the educational system and businesses and enterprises because of the involvement in the educational processes and finally the principal of dual education is a relatively cheap way to educate skilled labour compared to school based educational systems within VET. The economic crisis put pressure on the principle of dual education within vocational education and training (VET) because the firms and companies are less motivated to provide the necessary number of training places for the apprentices. On the one hand this causes problems for the young people wanting to take a vocational education as they are not able to finalize it without access to a proper training place. On the other hand it provides problems for businesses and enterprises because there will be a shortage of skilled labour in the future. In this paper a number of approaches to comply with this challenge from countries which organize their VET on the basis of dual education are presented. The examples come from Denmark, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Holland and Norway. The purpose of the paper is to provide knowledge and inspiration across countries about different ways of handling the principle of dual education in difficult economic situations and to create a basis for making the principle less fragile during economic down turns. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|We live in {{a global}} era; we can find the same {{products}} and services around the world. The barriers that used to exist have blurred or disappeared. In the past when we traveled {{from one country to}} another, there were many differences-cultural, political, social-and many times travelers had one or two bad experiences. Today things are easier, and countries are adapting to the global market and opening their doors to the world. Technology and Communications are two key factors in this globalization process. However, the people who develop and implement these factors {{are the ones who are}} helping the world to become a global marketplace. These people are the global leaders and managers [...] people who think beyond their cultural and social environments, people who are able to combine the needs of different countries into a single more homogenous need, people who lead organizations and countries as they improve their strategies and join the global era. This thesis highlights the different phases of globalization through which the world has lived over the years, from the trading era where people exchanged valuable goods with each other to the global era where the marketplace is a single global market. The thesis discusses the changes in industry and the various forces driving industry to make these changes, as well as tools to help evaluate the pressures for globalization. I consider globalization from three perspectives: the broad worldview, industry level, and then <b>company</b> <b>or</b> <b>firm</b> level and the different ways of doing business. Moving from the macro level to the micro level, I discuss the people who work in the organizations, those who are responsible for leading and managing the firm during its drive to become a global company. I present and discuss some of the skills needed and the tools that managers can use to facilitate their strategies. Then follows a discussion of some of the generic strategies that companies can pursue and the key success factors needed to develop appropriate global strategies. Next I develop a case study of Vitrocrisa, a Mexican company searching for an approach to globalization that will work best for the company. Here I explain the strategies, structure, and challenges that Vitrocrisa is facing. Also I suggest actions and plans that the company could pursue to facilitate the process. Finally, I present general conclusions about how a company can identify the skills of global managers, and then identify potential candidates, hire, and develop them. by Daniel R. Madero. Thesis (M.

30|$|There {{are also}} sector {{differences}} in gender inequality. Firstly, although the overall income gap {{between men and}} women shows a trend of steadily increasing incomes, the gender wage gap in the public sector is narrower than that in the private sector (Wang et al. 2008; Li et al. 2014). Secondly, women working in the public sector benefit more from the social security policy. China’s labor security system is still immature during the transitional period, and as a result, it has not yet been effectively implemented in the private sector, which is poorly regulated. In some private <b>firms</b> <b>or</b> <b>companies</b> (small <b>firms</b> <b>or</b> <b>companies</b> in particular), profit-driven employers might even look for ways to cut maternal leave costs for their female employees, making it difficult for these women to secure their full benefits. In short, compared to the private sector, the public sector provides better benefits for women and better protection of women’s rights.|$|R

Businesses may also be social non-profit enterprises or state-owned public enterprises operated by governments with specific social and economic objectives. A business owned by multiple private individuals may form as an incorporated <b>company</b> <b>or</b> jointly organise as a partnership.
