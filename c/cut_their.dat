5|$|In ancient China and Korea, {{hair was}} {{regarded}} as a precious legacy from parents. Most people would never <b>cut</b> <b>their</b> hair after they became adults, and cutting off one's hair was a penalty for minor crimes. Both men and women would coil up their hair and many hair-coiling styles were developed.|$|E
5|$|A {{separate}} {{account of the}} battle, given by Henry of Huntingdon, stated that Rædwald's army was split into three formations, led by Rædwald, Rægenhere, and Edwin. With more experienced fighters, Æthelfrith attacked in loose formation. At the sight of Rægenhere, perhaps thinking he was Edwin, Æthelfrith's men <b>cut</b> <b>their</b> way through to him and slew him. After {{the death of his}} son, Rædwald furiously breached his lines, killing Æthelfrith amid a great slaughter of the Northumbrians.|$|E
5|$|At Lulworth Cove, {{the waves}} have <b>cut</b> <b>their</b> {{way through the}} {{resistant}} Portland stone and created a horseshoe-shaped cove by eroding the softer sands and clays behind. Another feature {{of this part of}} the coast is Durdle Door, a natural arch. Sea stacks and pinnacles, such as Old Harry Rocks at Handfast Point, have been formed by erosion of the chalk cliffs.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Mongol wings closed around the {{shattered}} Rus' army, cutting off its retreat. The surrounded Rus' {{were hit by}} volley after volley, accompanied by cavalry charges at any weakness in the formation. As the Mongols were carrying this annihilation out, some of the army – led by Mstislav the Bold – managed to <b>cut</b> <b>their</b> way through the Mongol ring and escape.* Gabriel, Subotai The Valiant: Genghis Khan's Greatest General p. 100.|$|E
5|$|Buddhist texts {{recount the}} birth of the Buddhist Chinnamunda. One tale tells of Krishnacharya's disciples, two Mahasiddha ("great perfected ones") sisters, Mekhala and Kanakhala, who <b>cut</b> <b>their</b> heads, offered them to their guru, and then danced. The goddess Vajrayogini also {{appeared}} in this form and danced with them. Another story recalls how the Mahasiddha princess Lakshminkara, cut off her head as a punishment from the king and roamed with it in the city, where citizens extolled her as Chinnamunda-Vajravarahi.|$|E
5|$|Saumarez {{ordered his}} squadron's boats to assist Hannibal and Pompée, {{both of which}} were trapped under heavy fire and unable to {{effectively}} respond. As he did so, Linois ordered his ships to <b>cut</b> <b>their</b> anchor cables and drift into the shallows, away from the becalmed British squadron. Formidable successfully completed the manoeuvre, but both Desaix and Indomptable grounded inshore, where they were exposed to heavy fire from Saumarez's ships, which had also <b>cut</b> <b>their</b> cables in an effort to close with their opponents. At 13:35 however, Saumarez recognised that his squadron was in danger of grounding directly under the fire of the Spanish batteries. With the squadron's boats either sunk or employed towing Pompée back to Gibraltar, there was no possibility of launching an amphibious operation against the Spanish forts and Saumarez reluctantly called the attack off, the remainder of the squadron retiring to Gibratar but leaving the stranded Hannibal in the Bay of Gibraltar.|$|E

50|$|Hamm's party ran on {{a policy}} of fiscal management, tax <b>cuts,</b> and on <b>their</b> record of {{fulfilling}} most of their promises. While the NDP agreed in principle to tax <b>cuts,</b> <b>their</b> main cause {{was the creation of}} a public auto insurance company. The Liberals were the only party to criticize the tax cuts.|$|R
5|$|Some correctional facilities, like San Quentin State Prison, require {{visitors}} to either <b>cut</b> <b>their</b> bras {{and remove the}} underwire, or temporarily use a soft cup bra provided by the institution before being granted entry. The result can be embarrassment and consternation for unsuspecting visitors. Other facilities require women to remove their underwire bras in a bathroom, pass through the metal detector, {{and return to the}} bathroom to put their bras back on.|$|E
5|$|Starting 10 {{million years}} ago, {{vertical}} movement along the Sierra fault started to uplift the Sierra Nevada. Subsequent tilting of the Sierra block {{and the resulting}} accelerated uplift of the Sierra Nevada increased the gradient of western-flowing streams. The streams consequently ran faster and thus <b>cut</b> <b>their</b> valleys more quickly. Additional uplift occurred when major faults developed to the east, especially the creation of Owens Valley from Basin and Range-associated extensional forces. Uplift of the Sierra accelerated again about two million years ago during the Pleistocene.|$|E
5|$|The Nino Bixio {{class was}} a pair of {{protected}} cruisers built for the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy) in the 1910s. The two ships, , and , were built in Castellammare between 1911 and 1914. They were intended to serve as scouts for the main Italian fleet, and as such required a high top speed. They were overweight as built, which prevented them from reaching their intended maximum speed. They were a disappointment in service, especially compared to the earlierand fastercruiser , which <b>cut</b> <b>their</b> careers short.|$|E

5|$|Afghanistan did {{not send}} any {{delegation}} to the 1998 Asian Games held in Bangkok, Thailand, due to economic difficulties. Laws implemented by the Taliban government also {{made it impossible for}} Afghan athletes to compete. For example, the International Boxing Association (AIBA) does not allow players to have beards and mustaches, but Afghan males were forbidden to <b>cut</b> <b>their</b> facial hair. Afghanistan returned to the Asian Games {{after the fall of the}} Taliban government in the midst of ongoing war. In June 2003, the IOC lifted the suspension imposed on Afghanistan during the 115th IOC Session in Prague.|$|E
5|$|After {{reading an}} issue of the Tank Girl comic she had {{received}} as a gift, Talalay obtained permission from Deadlines publisher Tom Astor to direct a film adaptation. She selected Catherine Hardwicke to be the production designer, and worked closely with Martin and Hewlett during {{the making of the}} film. Tank Girl was filmed primarily in White Sands, New Mexico, and Tucson, Arizona. The film's critically praised soundtrack was assembled by Courtney Love, and the Rippers' makeup and prosthetics team was headed by Stan Winston. Winston's studio wanted to work on the project so much that they <b>cut</b> <b>their</b> usual prices in half {{in order to meet the}} film's budget.|$|E
5|$|City {{missed out}} on {{promotion}} {{and as a result}} had to <b>cut</b> <b>their</b> wage budget. However, Colbeck, whose contract had expired, was offered a new three-year deal on improved terms. He turned down the offer and stayed at the club on a week-to-week basis on his previous terms. He was watched in a pre-season friendly playing for City against Bradford Park Avenue by his former Darlington boss Dave Penney, who had since been appointed Oldham Athletic manager. Colbeck started the season with Bradford and played another five games, bringing his total to the club to 109, of which 41 were as substitute.|$|E

5|$|During the 2007 season, the Zero-G Rolls {{were removed}} from the ride and {{replaced}} with banked hills. Robin's hill was installed in March and Batman's in April. Batman's train was painted red so that Robin could use it, because Robin's train was damaged during a previous incident. The Robin side re-opened on April 7 and ran until June 28 when it was closed {{for the rest of the}} year. The Batman side did not operate at all, but three of the five cars from the original Robin train were placed on Batman's maintenance track. Because of all of the problems the coaster had and the numerous failed attempts to fix the coaster, Six Flags decided to <b>cut</b> <b>their</b> financial and technical losses and dismantle the ride.|$|E
5|$|Pemberton was {{boxed in}} {{with lots of}} munitions and little food. The poor diet was showing on the Confederate soldiers. By the end of June, half were out sick or hospitalized. Scurvy, malaria, dysentery, diarrhea, and other {{diseases}} <b>cut</b> <b>their</b> ranks. At least one city resident had to stay up at night to keep starving soldiers out of his vegetable garden. The constant shelling did not bother {{him as much as}} the loss of his food. As the siege wore on, fewer and fewer horses, mules, and dogs were seen wandering about Vicksburg. Shoe leather became a last resort of sustenance for many adults.|$|E
5|$|Pliny the Elder in his Natural History and Varro related {{that the}} Romans {{did not begin}} to <b>cut</b> <b>their</b> hair short until barbers were {{introduced}} to Italy from Sicily by P. Ticinius Mena in 299 BC. Women in Roman times valued long hair, usually with a center part. Apart from in the earliest times, men's hair was usually shorter than women's, although other cultures of the time, such as Greeks in the east, considered long hair to be typical of philosophers, who {{were thought to be}} too engrossed in learning to bother with hair. Strictly in the province of Rome, however, the shorter hairstyle was especially popular. When Julius Caesar conquered the Gauls, who favored long hair, he ordered it to be cut short.|$|E

5|$|Religious beliefs were {{central to}} the Kingdom of Nri. Nri oral {{tradition}} states that a bounty of yams and cocoyams could {{be given to the}} eze Nri, while blessings were given in return. It was believed that Nri's influence and bountiful amount of food was a reward for the ruler's blessings. Above all, Nri was a holy land for those Igbo who followed its edicts. It served as a place where sins and taboos could be absolved just by entering it. Even Igbo living far from the center of power would send abnormal children to Nri for ritual cleansing rather than having them killed, as was sometimes the case for dwarfs or children who <b>cut</b> <b>their</b> top teeth before their lower teeth.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Henry Dion {{appears to be}} a composite of several real life serial killers. His fondness for conversing with his victims' bodies and the gregarious demeanour shown during this seems to be based on Milwaukee-based murderer Jeffrey Dahmer, who would also, like Dion, document his victims photographically. The habit of photographing victims, and the notion of killing women to use them as props, stems from killer Henri Nadeau, who murdered several women in order to use them as mannequins for his photography. The use of an overbearing matriarchal figure as a stressor harkens to Edmund Kemper, who was driven to kill young women by his hatred of his mother, who he eventually murdered before turning himself in; both Dion and Kemper <b>cut</b> <b>their</b> mother's vocal folds from their throats after killing them.|$|E
5|$|The {{teaching}} of Eskayan in the volunteer schools {{is one of}} the few remaining cultural practices of the Eskaya community. Formerly, Eskaya men would wear shirts made of piña raffia with a Chinese-style collar, black breeches, and cotton berets. Women wore piña dresses with bulging sleeves similar to the Spanish-influenced Boholano style (mostly in Biabas) and covered their hair with cotton habits (mostly in Taytay). Traditionally, women were not permitted to <b>cut</b> <b>their</b> hair short nor wear trousers, and drinking and dancing were universally prohibited. For the most part these customs have been discontinued, however traditional dress is sometimes worn on Sundays and special occasions.|$|E
50|$|The Deep Six were a {{group of}} six Progressive Conservative Members of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta first elected in the 1993 provincial election. Sitting as backbenchers, they {{supported}} the government of Ralph Klein in its spending cuts to reduce the provincial deficit, and advocated still larger and swifter <b>cuts.</b> <b>Their</b> name came from their support for deep spending <b>cuts</b> and from <b>their</b> physical location in the Legislature—deep in the backbenches. According to Klein strategist Rod Love, Klein would ask to be briefed on the group's activities every morning of his first term.|$|R
