The position of <b>compulsory</b> retail <b>insurance</b> in the insurance market of the state was identified. The main type of <b>compulsory</b> retail <b>insurance</b> in the Republic of Kazakhstan, that is insurance of civil and legal liability of vehicle owners, was described and analysed. Basic tendencies of the market of <b>compulsory</b> retail <b>insurance</b> in Kazakhstan were identified. These include stable development with reduced economic efficiency due to the tendencies of companies to reduce insurance premiums when insuring civil and legal liability of vehicle owners. Specific features of the development of the <b>compulsory</b> retail <b>insurance</b> market of the Republic of Kazakhstan were determined. These are revealed in the regional and functional market concentration leading to its reduced competitive power and quality of insurance services.

2500|$|The tragedy {{had a major}} {{effect on}} {{mountaineering}} in Britain, particularly concerning adventure expeditions for children. At a political level, urged on by the press, there were proposals to ban mountaineering courses for children or at least require formal certification for their leaders. <b>Compulsory</b> <b>insurance</b> for mountaineers also came on the agenda. The British Mountaineering Council, representing practising amateur mountaineers and their clubs was initially opposed to all this – a bureaucracy should not be supervising adventure. [...] On the other hand, the Mountain Leader Training Board, composed of educators, was in favour on grounds of safety and teaching environmental awareness. Eventually a compromise was reached with the two bodies combining and a Mountain Leadership Certificate becoming required for educational expeditions.|$|E
2500|$|In the UK, {{questions}} were raised over whether T had any valid insurance in place. Those insurance companies {{which could be}} connected to T, such as Royal & Sun Alliance, alleged that their policies excluded liability for asbestos-related claims, although this was in breach of the Employers' Liability (<b>Compulsory</b> <b>Insurance)</b> Act 1969. Insurers stated that instead they had an [...] "understanding" [...] that T itself would settle asbestos claims and, [...] "in return for premiums received, the insurers would, however, issue a Certificate of Insurance which complied with {{the terms of the}} Employers' Liability Act, thereby enabling T to continue trading." [...] By 2003, no payments had been received by UK claimants and a request to the government to set up an interim compensation scheme was rejected, as was a request to the US Creditors' Committee of Federal-Mogul to make hardship payments to UK victims. As further litigation ensued to test the validity of the insurers' exclusions, public demonstrations were held outside the Manchester offices of Kroll Corporate Advisory & Restructuring Group, the court-appointed Administrators for T Tony Whitston, spokesperson for North-West Asbestos Victims’ Support Groups, said: [...] "Kroll have charged £17 million in fees to date and their solicitors have charged £6 million. The charge out rate for a senior partner at Kroll is £460 per hour. The financial “killing” being made by the Administrators is reducing the resources [...] left to pay dying victims.

2500|$|The most {{important}} protection for people's health {{has been the}} National Health Service, founded by the NHS Act 1946. The National Health Service Act 2006 entitles everyone to {{health care in the}} UK, and is funded through the tax system. If people are injured at work, they may be treated regardless of their means to pay. There is also the right, under the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 to statutory sick pay. People at work can also sue for compensatory damages whenever they are injured and employers have breached a statutory duty. They can claim for the injury itself, loss of income, and relatives or dependents may recover small sums to reflect distress. Employers are vicariously liable for all agents acting for them in the [...] "course of employment" [...] whenever their actions have a [...] "close connection" [...] to the job, and even if it breaks an employer's rules. An employer only has a defence if an employee, on a [...] "frolic of his own", was not placed by an employer in a position to cause harm. Under the Employers’ Liability (<b>Compulsory</b> <b>Insurance)</b> Act 1969, employers must take out insurance for all injury costs. Insurance companies may not their employee to recover costs unless there is fraud. However, until the mid-20th century there were a series of major limitations. First, until 1937, if an employee was injured by a co-worker, the doctrine of common employment, the employer could only be liable if it was shown they were personally liable by carelessness in selecting staff. The House of Lords changed this in Wilsons & Clyde Coal Co Ltd v English, holding an employer had a non-delegable duty of care for all employees. Lord Wright held there were [...] "fundamental obligations of a contract of employment... for which employers are absolutely responsible". The second old restriction was that, until 1891, volenti non fit injuria meant workers were assumed to voluntarily accept the dangers of their work by agreeing to their contracts of employment. Only if an employee callously ignores clear directions of the employer will he be taken to have voluntarily assumed the risk, like in ICI Ltd v Shatwell where an experience quarry shotfirer said he [...] "could not be bothered" [...] to wait 10 minutes before setting of a detonation, and blew up his brother. Third, even if a worker was slightly at fault, until 1945 such contributory negligence precluded the whole of the claim. Now the court will only reduce damages by the amount the employee contributed to their own injury. The fourth defence available to employers, which still exists, is ex turpi causa non oritur actio, that if the employee was engaged in any illegal activity they may not claim compensation for injuries. In Hewison v Meridian Shipping Services Pte Ltd Mr Hewison concealed his epilepsy so that he could work offshore was technically guilty of illegally attempting to gain a pecuniary advantage by deception under the Theft Act 1968 section 16. After being struck in the head by a defective gangplank he suffered worse fits than before, but the Court of Appeal, by a majority, held his illegal act precluded any compensation.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the modern}} scheme of {{legislation}} and regulation engenders {{a comprehensive approach}} to enforcement and worker participation for health and safety matters, the common law remains relevant for getting civil law compensation, and some limits on an employers' duties. Although the legislative provisions are not automatic, breach of a statutory duty is evidence that a civil law duty has been breached. Injured employees can generally claim for loss of income, and relatives or dependents recover small sums to reflect distress. In principle, employers are vicariously liable for all actions of people acting {{for them in the}} [...] "course of employment" [...] whenever their actions have a [...] "close connection" [...] to the job, and even if it breaks an employer's rules.

6000|$|These three tendencies cohere, or are cohering, in an {{institution}} which is not without a great historical basis and not without great modern conveniences. And as France was the standard-bearer of citizenship in 1798, Germany is the standard-bearer of this alternative solution in 1915. The institution which our fathers called Slavery fits in with, or rather logically flows from, all the three spirits of which I have spoken, and promises great advantages to each of them. It can give the individual worker everything except the power to alter the State--that is, his own status. Finality (or what certain eleutheromaniacs would call hopelessness) of status is the soul of Slavery--and of <b>Compulsory</b> <b>Insurance.</b> Then again, Germany gives the individual exactly the liberty {{that has always been}} given to a slave--the liberty to think, the liberty to dream, the liberty to rage; the liberty to indulge in any intellectual hypotheses about the unalterable world and state--such as have always been free to slaves, from the stoical maxims of Epictetus to the skylarking fairy tales of Uncle Remus. And it has been truly urged by all defenders of slavery that, if history has merely a material test, the material condition of the subordinate under slavery tends to be good rather than bad. When I once pointed out how precisely the [...] "model village" [...] of a great employer reproduces the safety and seclusion of an old slave estate, the employer thought it quite enough to answer indignantly that he had provided baths, playing-grounds, a theatre, etc., for his workers. He would probably have thought it odd to hear a planter in South Carolina boast that he had provided banjos, hymn-books, and places suitable for the cake-walk. Yet the planter must have provided the banjos, for a slave cannot own property. And if this Germanic sociology is indeed to prevail among us, I think some of the broad-minded thinkers who concur in its prevalence owe something like an apology to many gallant gentlemen whose graves lie where the last battle was fought in the Wilderness; men who had the courage to fight for it, the courage to die for it and, above all, the courage to call it by its name.|$|E
