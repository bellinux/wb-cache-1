40|$|A {{questionnaire}} {{was sent by}} post {{to a sample of}} holders of driving licenses who had been born in the year 1944. The questionnaire covered present travel habits, expectations regarding the future as older road users, and giving lifts to elderly people. By targeting this group, it is anticipated that a more correct picture can be obtained of such things as future travel patterns compared with the usual method of basing forecasts on today's elderly people. As regards present travel patterns, the results showed such things as a continuation of the unequal distribution of car driving between males and females, that the car dominated as a method of travel, and that the car was considered to be necessary more often by men than it was by women. Expectations regarding the future were <b>captured</b> <b>by</b> <b>asking</b> the <b>respondent</b> to imagine that he or she was 80 {{years old at the time}} of filling in the questionnaire, and indicating his or her view of the probability of various phenomena at that age. Most of the respondents anticipated a rather active and mobile old age ahead of them, and the degree of optimism increased with increased mileage driven annually. However, over one-third of the women considered that it was not at all probable that they would be driving a car at the age of 80. Almost half of the respondents gave lifts to older relatives and acquaintances regularly, typically up to four times a month...|$|R

50|$|The term religiosity {{refers to}} degrees of {{religious}} behaviour, belief, or spirituality. The measurement of religiosity is {{hampered by the}} difficulties involved in defining {{what is meant by}} the term. Numerous studies have explored the different components of religiosity, with most finding some distinction between religious beliefs/doctrine, religious practice, and spirituality. Studies can measure religious practice by counting attendance at religious services, religious beliefs/doctrine <b>by</b> <b>asking</b> a few doctrinal questions, and spirituality <b>by</b> <b>asking</b> <b>respondents</b> about their sense of oneness with the divine or through detailed standardized measurements. When religiosity is measured, it is important to specify which aspects of religiosity are referred to.|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} has found that prescription stimulant use on college campuses has increased in recent years although estimates of the actual amount of stimulant use vary. Studies have found that the motives for stimulant abuse also varied with some individuals indicating they used prescription stimulants for academic purposes while others used them to get high. The student role today includes many different aspects including academic, organizational, and social roles. For many students, these demands can cause strain on the individual. Those who experience difficulty in fulfilling these obligations are said to experience role strain. One type of role strain is role overload, which occurs when people feel that they do not feel like that they have the time or emotional capability to adequately fulfill their role. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the relationship between role overload and prescription stimulant use among Butler students. Data was collected using a 49 question survey administered to 200 students in several classrooms at Butler. The questionnaire contained questions on the student role, role overload, illicit drug use, prescription stimulant use, and demographic questions. The student role was measured <b>by</b> <b>asking</b> <b>respondents</b> the amount of time they spent in various activities included in the student role. Role overload was measured using an adapted version of an index created by Reilly (1982) to measure role overload among working mothers. Students were asked to indicate the extent to which they agree with statements about feelings of being overwhelmed and having adequate time to complete their daily tasks. Prescription stimulant use was measured <b>by</b> <b>asking</b> <b>respondents</b> whether or not they used certain prescription stimulants. <b>Respondents</b> were also <b>asked</b> frequency of use, motives for use, and how they acquired prescription stimulants. It is expected that students who experience role overload have a higher likelihood of abusing prescription stimulants...|$|R

40|$|In survey studies, {{probabilistic}} {{expectations about}} uncertain events are typically elicited <b>by</b> <b>asking</b> <b>respondents</b> for their introspective beliefs. If more complex procedures are feasible, beliefs can be elicited by incentive compatible revealed preference mechanisms (“truth serums”). Various mechanisms {{have been proposed}} in the literature, which differ in {{the degree to which}} they account for respondents’ deviations from expected value maximization. In this paper, we pit non-incentivized introspection against five truth serums, to elicit beliefs in a simple two-player game. We test the internal validity (additivity and predictive power for own behavior), and the external validity (predictive power for other players’ behavior, or accuracy) of each method. We find no differences among the truth serums. Beliefs from incentivized methods are better predictors of subjects’ own behavior compared to introspection. However, introspection performs equally well as the truth serums in terms of accuracy and additivity. ...|$|R

40|$|Research on the intergenerational {{transmission}} of status, cultural consumption, party preference, and religiosity is usually performed <b>by</b> <b>asking</b> <b>respondents</b> about their parents.

The measurement error in family background variables turns out to be mainly random error. In general, family background effects are underestimated if measurement error is not taken into account. Sometimes, a family background effect is overestimated. However, this usually only happens in models in which another effect is underestimated. Further, it is possible to obtain the correct family background effects, also if one has information provided only by primary respondents.

40|$|When voters vote ethnically, {{as they do}} in many African countries, what is the reason? Do voters prefer coethnics {{because of}} ethnic pride? Or is {{ethnicity}} as a proxy for performance? I use a voting simulation experiment in Uganda to investigate the underlying rationale for ethnic voting. I find evidence that voters anticipate more future goods from a coethnic presidential candidate. Most strikingly, I find that coethnicity matters to voters only when the candidate has a record of prior goods provisions and, similarly, that record matters most when the candidate is coethnic. Furthermore, those types of voters who would be most likely to receive ethnic patronage are those {{who are most likely to}} vote ethnically. I confirm this finding <b>by</b> <b>asking</b> <b>respondents</b> to make predictions about the future performance of coethnic and non-coethnic candidates.

40|$|Abstract: Leptospirosis is {{a serious}} public health concern in the Philippines, {{not only because of}} its {{increasing}} incidence rate, but also because of its significant health and economic impacts. Despite its relatively high seroprevalence, knowledge on the economic burden of disease, particularly on the value that the society places on disease prevention remains limited. Obtaining such information is important within the context of public health policy. This study was conducted in Metro Manila to determine the economic burden of leptospirosis, <b>by</b> <b>asking</b> <b>respondents</b> about their willingness to contribute to labor (WTC L) for the prevention of leptospirosis. The respondents pledged an average labor contribution of 10. 66 h/month.

It is argued in this paper, however, that because expectations have not been directly examined, Expectancy Theory has not provided a fair test of hypotheses. The current investigation aims to alleviate this problem by determining whether expectations people have for male and female sources of persuasive communication do in fact differ.

30|$|Instead {{of facing}} this problem head-on, {{we decided to}} define routine ex negativo, that is, <b>by</b> <b>asking</b> <b>respondents</b> whether their jobs were in some ways nonroutine. For that purpose, we focused on two job aspects we assumed should at least complicate their {{substitution}} by computers or machines. First, it should {{be more difficult to}} replace jobs that involve rather complex tasks {{in the sense that they}} require incumbents to react to unforeseen situations, to learn new things, or to deal with problems. A second dimension that should make a job hard to replace by technological means is autonomy. As Bresnahan et al. (2002) and others have argued, SBTC should not simply be considered a process in which firms invest in information technologies but rather as one in which the growing use of IT, organizational changes (resulting in higher discretion of workers and requiring higher levels of cognitive skills, flexibility and autonomy; ibid. pp. 345 ff.), and changes in the companies’ products and services are intertwined.|$|R
30|$|Issues of data {{integrity}} {{with reference to}} the use of student contacts for cohort 1 may have occurred, although procedures were taken to minimise these by presenting no specific hypothesis, and allowing students to not contribute results with no penalty if difficulties were encountered. Further, the finding that a separate cohort recruited through different means (MTurk) and accessing a different sample produced almost identical results provides reassurance relating to the integrity of the data. In addition, the question of the relative importance of the four types of responsibility was assessed in two ways: firstly <b>by</b> <b>asking</b> <b>respondents</b> to rate the importance of a series of five examples of each type of business responsibility, which was then averaged to give an overall score of importance for that responsibility, and secondly by a simple ranking of the four types of responsibility. As both forms of approaching the question gave rise to similar results, this provides further reassurance with respect to data validity and integrity.|$|R
