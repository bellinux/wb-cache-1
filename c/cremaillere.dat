5|$|The {{first major}} upgrade of Mdina's fortifications {{occurred}} in the 1540s, during the magistracy of Juan de Homedes y Coscon. Two new bastions were built at the extremities of the land front, possibly to designs of the military engineer Antonio Ferramolino. Parts of the eastern walls were also rebuilt en <b>crémaillère,</b> the only instance this style is found in Malta. The 15th-century barbican {{in front of the}} main gate was demolished in 1551 since it obstructed the line of fire of the newly built bastions. That year, the city withstood a brief Ottoman attack.|$|E
5|$|The North Front defences, still {{following}} the course {{laid out by}} the Moors in the 11th century, are still substantially intact. A {{significant portion of the}} original Spanish and Moorish walls can still be seen, rising in a saw-tooth (en <b>crémaillère)</b> fashion from the Grand Battery. Although gaps have been cut in the walls to allow vehicle traffic to enter the city centre, pedestrians can still walk over the wooden drawbridge over the North Front ditch to pass through the Landport Gate into the city. The Moorish Tower of Homage continues to stand above the Grand Battery on the lower slopes of the Rock. It is now open to the public as part of the Upper Rock Nature Reserve.|$|E

50|$|A <b>Crémaillère</b> is a French, {{mechanical}} {{term for}} the rack, or a straight bar with teeth on one edge designed to work into the teeth of a wheel or a pinion (French pignon) that predates the Renaissance. The term was generally applied in English to engineering applications which had notched, toothed or drilled surface, even when only visually so, such as {{the edge of the}} staircase. The term is also applied to the rack railway.|$|E

5000|$|A housewarming {{party is}} called a pendaison de <b>crémaillère,</b> {{literally}} [...] "hanging of the chimney hook". The expression comes from medieval times. When {{the construction of the}} house was finished, it was customary to invite all those who participated in its building to eat dinner as a vote of thanks. The food was prepared in a large pot, the temperature of which was controlled by a chimney hook, which could adjust the pot so it sat higher or lower over the fireplace. This hook was the last thing to be installed in the new house, marking the beginning of the thank you meal.|$|E
50|$|In 1882 Rip Van Winkle was {{produced}} in London and subsequently given in Paris as Rip, in both cases with great success. The libretto is an adaptation by H. B. Farnie of Washington Irving's famous tale. In 1884 the phenomenon of an opera by a French composer being produced in London before being heard in Paris was repeated in Nell Gwynne, which was modestly successful, but failed when produced in Paris as La Princesse Colombine. It was followed by La <b>Crémaillere</b> (Paris, 1885), Surcouf (Paris, 1887; London, as Paul Jones, 1889), Captain Thérése (London, 1887), La Cocarde tricolore (Paris, 1892), Le Talisman (Paris, 1892), Panurge (Paris, 1895) and Mam'zelle Quat'sous (Paris, 1897).|$|E

5000|$|In Keicho 20 (1615), {{the mound}} was planted with pine trees that acted as shitomi-uemono (visual barriers), {{prevented}} landslides, {{and served as}} windbreaks, as flaming torches, as building materials, and as emergency food. On the western and eastern sides, the mound lines have many ori (<b>cremaillere,</b> a front or face with receding steps, which consists of short and long branches) which permit flanking fire. The byobu-ori (tenaille lines formed by making alternate angles salient and re-entering), which {{can be seen from}} the south of the inner castle to the area to the east of the inner castle, is enormous. In general, byobu-ori have been shown to resemble the defensive lines of western fortifications. They thus bear eloquent witness to the depth of the foresight of [...] "Kuroda Yoshitaka".|$|E
50|$|The Da Lat-Thap Cham Railway (Đường sắt Tháp Chàm-Đà Lạt) or Da Lat-Phan Rang Railway (Đường sắt Phan Rang-Đà Lạt) was an 84 km {{rack railway}} {{connecting}} {{the city of}} Da Lat to the main North-South Railway at Tháp Chàm in Ninh Thuận Province. It was established by the French administration of Indochina in 1932 after thirty years of construction in phases, beginning in 1903. The first section, running 41 km from Tháp Chàm to Sông Pha, opened in 1919, and the second section, running 43 km from Song Pha to Da Lat, opened in 1932. Due to the mountainous terrain, the Sông Pha-Da Lat section used rack rails in three sections, and included five tunnels. The Da Lat-Tháp Chàm railway is occasionally {{referred to as a}} <b>Crémaillère</b> railway, referring to the French word for the rack used on its rails.|$|E
50|$|Tyrawley {{nonetheless}} {{went ahead}} with the project, constructing it from earth as planned. Old barrels were used to provide support for the works and the glacis was made from a mound of the town's rubble. It was then compacted to form a solid mass hard enough, it was said, for the guns to be brought along the covered way without their wheels making an indentation on the ground. Laid out en <b>cremaillère</b> (in a stepwise fashion), the lines were broken at intervals by embrasures for batteries housing guns mounted in pairs. Batteries at the Flat Bastion and the demi-bastion above would provide additional support. The idea was that a defending force would occupy the trenches {{in the event of}} an enemy landing and drive off the invaders with volleys of canister or grape shot from 8-inch howitzers.|$|E
