5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} usually {{diagnosed}} {{based on the}} person's medical history, history from relatives, and behavioural observations. The presence of characteristic neurological and neuropsychological features {{and the absence of}} alternative conditions is supportive. Advanced medical imaging with <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and with single-photon emission <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) can be used to help exclude other cerebral pathology or subtypes of dementia. Moreover, it may predict conversion from prodromal stages (mild cognitive impairment) to Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
5|$|If {{cerebral}} edema {{is suspected}} because of confusion, recurrent vomiting or other symptoms, <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> may be performed to assess its severity and to exclude other causes such as stroke.|$|E

5|$|Gamma {{emission}} {{from the}} radioisotope 133Xe of xenon {{can be used}} to image the heart, lungs, and brain, for example, by means of single photon emission <b>computed</b> <b>tomography.</b> 133Xe has also been used to measure blood flow.|$|E
5|$|Other imaging methods, such as ultrasonography, <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> (CT), and {{magnetic}} imaging (MRI), can aid in diagnosis.

5|$|Although xenon has {{potential}} {{for use in}} <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> (CT) to assess regional ventilation, its anesthetic properties limit its fraction in the breathing gas to 35%. A breathing mixture of 30% xenon and 30% krypton is comparable in effectiveness for CT to a 40% xenon fraction, while avoiding the unwanted effects of a high partial pressure of xenon gas.|$|E

5|$|<b>Computed</b> <b>tomography</b> (CT) scans and Technetium-99m bone scans {{are also}} {{sometimes}} {{used to monitor}} the progress of treatment. Unlike plain radiographs (X-rays), CT scans and MRI scans can show the exact location and extent of the lesion. Technetium bone scans can detect regional blood flow {{and the amount of}} osseous uptake. Both of these seem to be closely correlated to the potential for healing in the fragment.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of a {{pneumothorax}} {{by physical}} examination alone {{can be difficult}} (particularly in smaller pneumothoraces). A chest X-ray, <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> (CT) scan, or ultrasound is usually used to confirm its presence. Other conditions that can result in similar symptoms include a hemothorax (buildup {{of blood in the}} pleural space), pulmonary embolism, and heart attack. A large bullae may look similar on a chest X-ray.|$|E
5|$|If {{other causes}} rather than gallstones are {{suspected}} (such as a tumor), <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) may be performed {{to identify the}} nature of the obstruction. EUS may be used to obtain biopsy (tissue sample) of suspicious masses. EUS may also replace diagnostic ERCP for stone disease, although this depends on local availability.|$|E
30|$|On <b>computed</b> <b>tomographies,</b> CNs appear {{heterogeneously}} hyperdense with {{contrast enhancement}} while on magnetic resonance imaging; they are isointense on T 1 -weighted images and slightly hyperintense on T 2 -weighted images with vivid contrast enhancement [12]. These features may {{be confused with}} other intraventricular tumors especially ependymomas, oligodendrogliomas, and subependymal astrocytomas even after histopathology. So, immunohistochemistry is of utmost importance for accurate diagnosis [4].|$|R

Reentry with explantation of the TM and simultaneous implantation of 44 implants were performed after 6  months.

5|$|There {{are various}} neuroimaging {{investigations}} that may detect cerebral sinus thrombosis. Cerebral edema and venous infarction may be apparent on any modality, {{but for the}} detection of the thrombus itself, the most commonly used tests are <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), both using various types of radiocontrast to perform a venogram and visualise the veins around the brain.|$|E
5|$|Ultrasound of {{the liver}} and biliary tree is often used as the initial imaging {{modality}} in patients with suspected obstructive jaundice. Ultrasound can identify obstruction and ductal dilatation and, in some cases, may be sufficient to diagnose cholangiocarcinoma. <b>Computed</b> <b>tomography</b> (CT) scanning may also {{play an important role}} in the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma.|$|E
5|$|Causes include falls, vehicle collisions, and violence. Brain trauma {{occurs as}} a {{consequence}} of a sudden acceleration or deceleration within the cranium or by a complex combination of both movement and sudden impact. In addition to the damage caused at the moment of injury, a variety of events in the minutes to days following the injury may result in secondary injury. These processes include alterations in cerebral blood flow and the pressure within the skull. Some of the imaging techniques used for diagnosis include <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> and magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs).|$|E

5|$|Cerebral venous sinus {{thrombosis}} (CVST) is {{the presence}} of acute thrombosis (a blood clot) in the dural venous sinuses, which drain blood from the brain. Symptoms may include headache, abnormal vision, any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness of the face and limbs {{on one side of the}} body, and seizures. The diagnosis is usually by <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> (CT/CAT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) employing radiocontrast to demonstrate obstruction of the venous sinuses by thrombus.|$|E
5|$|If one {{of these}} tests shows a {{deficiency}} of hormones produced by the pituitary, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the pituitary {{is the first step}} in identifying an underlying cause. MRI may show various tumors and may assist in delineating other causes. Tumors smaller than 1cm are referred to as microadenomas, and larger lesions are called macroadenomas. <b>Computed</b> <b>tomography</b> with radiocontrast may be used if MRI is not available. Formal visual field testing by perimetry is recommended, as this would show evidence of optic nerve compression by a tumor.|$|E
