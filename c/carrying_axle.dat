25|$|Stephenson's {{most visible}} {{decision}} {{was to use}} {{a single pair of}} driving wheels, with a small <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> behind. This was the first 0-2-2 and first single driver locomotive. The use of single drivers gave several advantages. The weight of coupling rods was avoided and the second axle could be smaller and lightweight, as it only carried a small proportion of the weight. Rocket placed just over 2½tons of its 4¼ton total weight onto its driving wheels, a higher axle load than Sans Pareil, even though the 0-4-0 was heavier overall at 5ton, and officially disqualified by being over the 4½ton limit. Early locomotive designers had been concerned that the adhesion of a locomotive's driving wheels would be inadequate, but Stephenson's past experience convinced him that this would not be a problem, particularly with the light trains of the trials contest.|$|E
500|$|In {{line with}} the {{philosophy}} behind Cole's Alco prototypes, the Gresley Pacifics were built to the maximum limits of the LNER loading gauge with a large boiler and wide firebox giving a large grate area. [...] The firebox was set low and rested on the trailing <b>carrying</b> <b>axle.</b> However, unlike the Pennsylvania K4, the firebox was not of the flat-topped Belpaire variety, but a round-topped one that was in line with Great Northern tradition. Features {{in common with the}} American types were the downward profile towards the back of the firebox and the boiler tapering towards the front. Heat transfer and the flow of gases were helped by use of a combustion chamber extending forward from the firebox space into the boiler barrel, along with a boiler tube length limited to , features inherited from the K4 type but not present on the earlier Cole Prototypes. The boiler pressure was rated at [...]|$|E
2500|$|Cornwall was {{an attempt}} to avoid the {{damaging}} long wheelbase of the Cramptons, whilst still permitting large driving wheels. By moving the driving axle ahead of the firebox, one of the carrying axles could be moved backwards, giving a shorter overall wheelbase. The difficulty of how to fit the axles past the boiler recurred, to which Trevithick provided an [...] "extremely complicated" [...] solution. The boiler was placed entirely underneath the driving axle. Even then, it was necessary to recess a transverse channel {{across the top of the}} boiler, so as to provide clearance for the driving axle. The trailing <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> passed through a crosswise tube through the middle of the firebox. This made assembly difficult, but as it was only a straight <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> rather than a cranked driving axle, the tube diameter required was manageable. This use of a cross-firebox axle tube was part of Crampton's patent of 1842. As completed in 1847, and first numbered 173, Cornwall was a 4-2-2 with 8'6" [...] drivers, paired leading wheels of 3'6", single trailing wheels of 4' and an overall wheelbase of 16'6". This is the condition in which she was exhibited at The Great Exhibition of 1851.|$|E
5000|$|Class T 5 of the Palatinate Railway was a German, goods train, tank {{locomotive}} {{class with}} five coupled <b>axles</b> and no <b>carrying</b> <b>axles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Springing of the {{coupled axles}} was {{achieved}} using overhung leaf springs. The spring elements were linked by equalising beams. On the <b>carrying</b> <b>axles,</b> transverse leaf springs were used.|$|R
50|$|As {{the driving}} wheels {{were small and}} articulated, {{there was no need}} for {{separate}} <b>carrying</b> <b>axles.</b> All wheels could be powered, so that the locomotive's entire weight could be used for adhesion.|$|R
2500|$|On a tank {{locomotive}} {{the fuel}} (most often coal) is {{carried in a}} bunker the location of which can vary. [...] On a locomotive with a trailing <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> or a trailing bogie the bunker is generally situated {{to the rear of}} the cab, but in cases where the firebox overhangs the rear driving axle, it has been common practice to situate the bunker on top of and to one side of the firebox; this concentrates the weight and stabilises the locomotive.|$|E
2500|$|They had a low {{axle loading}} {{to allow them}} to operate on the light track and bridges on the Stillwater–Westport Line to provide a {{proposed}} new Greymouth–Westport service, once the building of the line was completed. Hence the power bogie was built with three axles with an intermediate <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> instead of two axles as originally proposed. [...] They were designed to operate at speeds of up to , though in service they were restricted to a maximum speed of , which was still fast for rural New Zealand railway lines at the time.|$|E
50|$|The bogie {{comprises}} a <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> {{connected to}} a coupled axle via a shaft or lever. In straight running, any radial movement of the <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> results in a sideways movement of the coupled axle in the opposite direction. However, the <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> is centred by means of two heavy duty springs just behind it. In addition the pivot pin may be allowed to move sideways, but again is held centrally by heavy springs. When travelling round a curve, the <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> swings to one side causing the coupled axle to move sideways in the opposite direction. In this way radial forces during curve running {{are more or less}} evened out on both axles, so that riding qualities similar to those of a normal bogie are achieved and wear and tear reduced on wheel flanges and rails.|$|E
50|$|The driving axles {{were fixed}} rigidly into the {{locomotive}} frame. To improve curve running the wheel flanges {{of the driving}} wheels were reduced. The <b>carrying</b> <b>axles</b> were designed as Adams axles and had leaf return springs.|$|R
50|$|The three driven {{wheelsets}} {{are fixed}} firmly {{in a bar}} frame with a 70 mm side thickness (Wangenstärke). The two front and rear <b>carrying</b> <b>axles</b> are able to swing out radially and are housed in a Bissell truck.|$|R
2500|$|Ae 4/7: Standard gauge {{locomotive}} with {{a maximum}} speed of over [...] (A), powered by electricity (e), with four drive axles (4) {{and a total of}} seven (7) <b>axles,</b> i.e. three <b>carrying</b> <b>axles.</b> (This classification could also denote an electric railcar with a first class compartment.) ...|$|R
5000|$|The Schwartzkopff-Eckhardt II bogie is {{a further}} {{refinement}} of the Krauss-Helmholtz bogie, whereby two coupled axles and the <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> are combined within the bogie. The <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> steers the second coupled axle via a long shaft and this also moves the first coupled axle via a Beugniot lever. This bogie is used on the DRG Class 84. Whether DR Class 99.23-24 locomotives were also fitted with this arrangement is not entirely clear.|$|E
5000|$|These {{locomotives}} {{were the}} first compound locomotives in Saxony. Its two-cylinder, compound engine was located behind the <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> and drove the final axle. The locomotives had an inside Allan valve gear. The steam dome was in {{the centre of the}} boiler over the middle axle. The running gear had an improved Nowotny <b>carrying</b> <b>axle,</b> nevertheless it did not have good riding qualities. The Schleifer brakes were later converted to Westinghouse brakes.|$|E
50|$|After the Planets, most {{passenger}} locomotives {{began to}} use a 2-2-2 arrangement, with an additional front <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> to give better riding at speed.|$|E
5000|$|Characteristic of ÜK {{locomotives}} are e.g. {{disc wheels}} on the <b>carrying</b> <b>axles</b> and {{the omission of}} the front side windows in the driver's cabs. Even preheaters, feed pumps, Frontschürzen, smoke deflectors and other equipment not essential for {{the operation of the}} locomotives were sometimes left out.|$|R
50|$|Because, today, {{locomotives}} {{no longer}} {{tend to have}} separate driving and <b>carrying</b> <b>axles</b> (see wheel arrangement), as was formerly common with steam locomotives, but usually have bogies where all axles are driven, the term running gear is (inaccurately) superseding the term 'driving gear' {{in some parts of}} the world.|$|R
50|$|Nineteen {{were built}} as the Pm class with plain {{bearings}} on the coupled axles and roller bearings on the <b>carrying</b> <b>axles.</b> The other sixteen were built as the Pmr class with roller bearings on all axles. One Pm was later {{converted to a}} Pmr at Midland Railway Workshops.|$|R
5000|$|For the brakes, there was, {{next to the}} smokebox a {{single-stage}} air pump, and {{in front}} of the <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> were one or two air reservoirs.|$|E
50|$|The main {{rationale}} for locating the earlier G 2/2+2/3 class's sole <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> {{in a position}} under the locomotive's cab had been that it increased the locomotive's operating reserves. However, it quickly became apparent that these changes had not improved the locomotive's ride quality, and that the G 2/2+2/3 class caused similarly high flange and track wear as their predecessors, the G 2x2/2 class. That was the basis on which the G 2/3+2/2 class was later built with a leading <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> instead of a trailing one.|$|E
5000|$|The new {{layout and}} the length of the {{wheelbase}} were a concern, and a means was needed to provide some flexibility. Flamme had used a Krauss-Helmholtz bogie where the front <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> and the leading driver were articulated as a bogie.|$|E
50|$|These tank {{locomotives}} {{were built}} for hauling goods trains and had three coupled <b>axles</b> but no <b>carrying</b> <b>axles.</b> All 110 examples {{went into the}} Deutsche Reichsbahn fleet where they were incorporated as DRG Class 89.3-4 in the numbering plan. By 1945 {{almost all of them}} had been retired or transferred to industry.|$|R
50|$|These ten-coupled {{locomotives}} had <b>carrying</b> <b>axles</b> {{housed in}} a Bissel bogie. The fixed third axle acted as the driving axle and had thinner wheel flanges to begin with. After 1945 its flanges were removed entirely to improve curve running still further. The wheelbase was 3,000 mm initially; this was later increased to 4,000 mm.|$|R
2500|$|A 3/5: Standard gauge {{locomotive}} with a {{top speed}} of over [...] (A), powered by steam (no traction type designator), with three drive axles (3) and a total of five axles (5), i.e. two <b>carrying</b> <b>axles.</b> [...] (This could also be the classification of a railcar with first class compartment.) The locomotive's tender is not included in the descriptor.|$|R
50|$|The main {{rationale}} for locating the G 2/2+2/3 class's sole <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> {{in a position}} under the locomotive's cab was that it increased the locomotive's operating reserves. As the boiler and chassis dimensions remained essentially the same, only the boiler pressure was increased from 12 to 14 atms. Consequently, the high-pressure cylinder diameter was minimised, and the rather large rear overhang was reduced. However, it quickly became apparent that these changes did not improve the locomotive's ride quality, and that the locomotives caused similarly high flange and track wear as their predecessors. That was the basis on which the G 2/3+2/2 class was later built with a leading <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> instead of a trailing one.|$|E
50|$|In {{spite of}} the extra <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> the top speed could only be raised to 45 km/h, so that later rebuilds or new engines {{were based on the}} GtL 4/4 (the rebuild {{becoming}} the DRG Class 98.11 (1'D)) and LAG Nos. 87 and 88 (1'D1')).|$|E
50|$|The {{coupled axles}} had {{overhung}} springing using leaf springs. An equalising beam, {{level with the}} axle boxes, linked the two springs. On the final batch of 1869 the springs were located underneath the axle boxes of the coupled wheels. On the <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> the springs were above the frame.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to their predecessors the machines {{were given a}} plate frame. Like them, however, the third axle is driven and the <b>carrying</b> <b>axles</b> are housed in a Bissel bogie. Two vacuum injectors form the feed water system. In order to enable brown coal firing, the grate area was increased {{compared with that of}} the Einheitslok.|$|R
50|$|The {{renumbering}} {{of electric}} locomotives followed in 1926/1927 {{and used a}} similar scheme as that employed for the steam locomotives, with a main class number and a serial number. They were distinguished from steam locomotives by a preceding letter E. The engines were arranged according to top speed {{and the number of}} driven and <b>carrying</b> <b>axles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Locomotive numbers 1 to 3 on the Lübeck-Büchen railway (Lübeck-Büchener Eisenbahn or LBE) in Germany were {{streamlined}} tank locomotives. The locomotives had a 2-4-2T wheel arrangement, a two-cylinder, superheated {{engine and}} {{were capable of}} push-pull operations. In order to ensure a symmetrical running gear, both <b>carrying</b> <b>axles</b> were built as Bissel bogies, which were fitted with return devices for improved running.|$|R
5000|$|Eighteen of the Japanese [...] narrow-gauge Bo-Bo {{electric}} [...] were rebuilt in {{the late}} 1970s to form the Class ED62. An additional <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> was added between the bogies to give a Bo-1-Bo (AAR) or Bo'1Bo' (UIC) arrangement. The intention was to give a lighter axle loading for the Iida Line.|$|E
5000|$|All four axles of the {{locomotives}} - {{even the}} carrying axles - {{were more or}} less equally loaded with a hefty 16 tonnes. The <b>carrying</b> <b>axle</b> was linked to the first coupled axle via a Krauss-Helmholtz bogie. The axles were located in a plate frame, inside which a well tank was rivetted.|$|E
5000|$|A Bissel truck (also: Bissell {{truck or}} Bissel bogie) is a single-axled bogie which pivots towards {{the centre of}} a steam {{locomotive}} to enable it to negotiate curves more easily. Invented in 1857 by [...] and usually known as a pony truck, {{it is a very}} simple and common means of designing a <b>carrying</b> <b>axle.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Royal Saxon State Railways {{took over}} the two prize-winning {{locomotives}} and procured another 13 up to 1903 that differed from the prototypes, particularly {{in terms of the}} diameter of the <b>carrying</b> <b>axles.</b> They were the largest and most powerful locomotives in Saxony to that point. The X V was employed on express train duties on the plains where its riding qualities and economy were impressive.|$|R
50|$|The {{physically}} identical Palatine and Bavarian Class R 4/4 {{engines of}} the Royal Bavarian State Railways (Königlich Bayerische Staats-Eisenbahnen) were goods train tank locomotives with four coupled <b>axles</b> and no <b>carrying</b> <b>axles.</b> The first nine machines were {{built for the}} Palatinate Railway (Pfalzbahn) in 1913 and 1915 as the Palatine Class R 4, the remainder from 1918 to 1925 as Bavarian R 4/4 engines.|$|R
25|$|One {{solution}} to the problem was the Crampton design, in which the driving axle was moved behind the boiler's firebox. These engines were relatively long in comparison to their contemporaries, and had long rigid frames, sometimes with as many as three <b>carrying</b> <b>axles</b> ahead of the driving axle, creating a 6-2-0 wheel arrangement. Cramptons were most popular in France and Germany, but some were also used in England, by companies including the London & North Western Railway (LNWR).|$|R
