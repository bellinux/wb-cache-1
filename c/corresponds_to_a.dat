5|$|Martin, Odlyzko, and Wolfram {{investigate}} pseudoforests {{that model}} {{the dynamics of}} cellular automata. These functional graphs, which they call state transition diagrams, have one vertex for each possible configuration that the ensemble of cells of the automaton can be in, and an edge connecting each configuration to the configuration that follows it according to the automaton's rule. One can infer properties of the automaton from the structure of these diagrams, such {{as the number of}} components, length of limiting cycles, depth of the trees connecting non-limiting states to these cycles, or symmetries of the diagram. For instance, any vertex with no incoming edge <b>corresponds</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Garden of Eden pattern and a vertex with a self-loop <b>corresponds</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> still life pattern.|$|E

5|$|The number 1 (expressed as a {{fraction}} 1/1) is {{placed at the}} root of the tree, and the location of any other number a/b can be found by computing gcd(a,b) using the original form of the Euclidean algorithm, in which each step replaces the larger of the two given numbers by its difference with the smaller number (not its remainder), stopping when two equal numbers are reached. A step of the Euclidean algorithm that replaces the first of the two numbers <b>corresponds</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> step in the tree from a node to its right child, and a step that replaces the second of the two numbers <b>corresponds</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> step in the tree from a node to its left child.
