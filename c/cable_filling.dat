With this research for developing lower dielectric materials for insulation and <b>cable</b> <b>filling</b> compounds is going on worldwide. This was instrumental to develop a twisted pair copper cable with low dielectric constant jelly.

40|$|AbstractThe {{ability to}} form gigaseals is {{essential}} for patch-clamp electrophysiology; however, ion channels located in the seal can produce measureable currents. To explore the expected properties of channels in the seal (i. e., rim channels), we created a mathematical model. The seal was a two-dimensional <b>cable</b> <b>filled</b> with saline and bounded on one side by membrane (with resistance and capacitance) {{and on the other}} side by glass (nonconductive and noncapacitive). We included ion depletion/accumulation around the channels. The channels were ohmic with a conductance that increased with the concentration of permeant ions. The aqueous seal thickness was set nominally to 1  nm. Imaging with fluorescent dyes in the pipette showed that the hydrophilic dye Alexa 488 is impermeant, but lipophilic FM 1 - 43 labels the seal. The model showed that to obtain high-resistance seals, the conductivity of the seal media has to be < 10 % that of the bath. Stimulus voltages decreased with distance down the seal. In agreement with results in the literature, channels in the seal can produce currents similar to those in the pipette-spanning dome. The transition times of currents are slower due to membrane capacitance. If channel densities are uniform, patch currents are dominated by channels in the dome...|$|R

40|$|Transmission of {{electric}} power from power plants to the load center or customer hold very important part. It {{is necessary to}} calculate power loss, voltage drop, and current-carrying capacity. Power loss refer to the heat generated in cable conducting parts (phase conductors, sheath, and armour) and in cable insulating part. Heating power in phase conductors, sheath, and armour mainly depend on current values. When dealing with underground power cable or submarine power cable, sheath circulating currents can be induced. These currents produce power loss in the sheath and decrease the ampacity (current-carrying capacity) of the cables. This paper discussed the calculation and comparison of power loss, voltage drop, and current-carrying capacity in three phase single-core XLPE insulated cables and 3 -cores oil <b>filled</b> <b>cable</b> of 150 kV rated voltage.

40|$|A fire in {{important}} cable tunnels inside power plants {{would lead to}} stoppage in production {{that could lead to}} big financial losses for the owners of the plant, which makes short restoration time very important. With the consequences of stoppage in mind, more focus has been directed to issues regarding fire protection of cable tunnels in the power plants. The purpose of this report is to provide a more comprehensive material to the ongoing investigations within Vattenfall Vattenkraft AB regarding fire protection within their power plants. It will also be used as material for future issues regarding insurance and new projects within Vattenfall Vattenkraft AB. The room that will serve as typical case for this investigation is a cable tunnel inside Harsprånget power plant. The cable tunnel is initially situated approximately 80 meters below ground level in direct connection with the power plant and contains 2 - 7 cable trays with a varied amount of cables on each tray. The cable tunnel then runs {{all the way up to}} ground level. One problem is that the cable tunnel system is more or less open through its whole geometry, which in case of fire in the lower regions could make the whole tunnel system filled with smoke. When adding the fact that the plant is unmanned for the most part, and it’s calculated to take at least 40 minutes before personnel has arrived at the scene in case of fire or other accident. All this makes a fully developed fire very hard to handle. Calculations have been made regarding fire load and maximum heat release rate, and it has been stated that the cable tunnel has a high fire load from the many cable trays, which make oxygen the limiting factor. The cable tunnels closed space and the fact that it´s made of stone and concrete makes the inflow of oxygen very limited. The narrow, complicated geometry is expected to make it impossible for the fire to use all oxygen in the further regions of the tunnel system. This was later verified by simulations made with Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS). Different solutions for the fire protection have been analyzed to achieve a proper fire protection for the cable tunnel, and the use of an extinguishing system with water mist in combination with fire sections of the cable tunnel has been suggested to be the most effective solution for the fire protection. The use of fire sections contributes to create a more controllable volume for the extinguishing system. It will also erase the problem with the smoke <b>filled</b> <b>cable</b> tunnel system, which leads to an easier restoration. After consulting with experts within extinguishing system it has been stated that sections of 100 meters are suitable to handle for the system. Final set-up of the fire sections will vary depending on which plant referred to. Thanks to the high pressure within water mist systems vertical sections won´t be a problem. The set-up of the extinguishing system has finally ended up in two different protection levels, an increased protection level and a normal protection level. With the increased protection level the extinguishing system activates within a whole section using a fire detection system, the extinguishing system actives when a fire is indicated and the fire will be extinguished in an early stage. With the normal protection level the extinguishing system activates using heat sensitive bulbs that break at a certain temperature. This activation method needs some temperature build up (for example 57 or 68 °C bulbs can be used), and by that time the fire has already started. Affected cables have a higher risk of losing their functionality and needing replacing. Validerat; 20140131 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
