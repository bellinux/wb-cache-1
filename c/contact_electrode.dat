30|$|In {{terms of}} the {{photoresponse}} performance, the discrepancy of these above results can be explained as follows. When the device is in forward-biased mode, the depletion region width decreases and enhances the current flow {{that leads to the}} lower sensitivity to white light. However, the device in reverse-biased mode, by contrast, has the larger depletion region where the strong built-in electric field exists. The photogenerated electrons and holes can be separated efficiently and reduce the electron-hole recombination rates under the white light illumination, thus resulting in an abrupt increase in free carrier density. Therefore, rectifying devices have a high response rate property. However, in previous studies [27, 28], rectifying devices with one Ohmic <b>contact</b> <b>electrode</b> and the other Schottky <b>contact</b> <b>electrode</b> were fabricated by selecting various electrode materials. In this study, an easy manufacturing process was used.

40|$|III-V {{semiconductor}} nanowires (NWs) {{have shown}} great {{potential to be}} building blocks for optical, optoelectronic, and electronic devices due to their special transverse confinement of electrons and photons along the nanowire axis. In addition, semiconductor nanowires with subwavelength structures exhibit strong optical Mie resonance, making them ideal platforms for realizing novel optical devices, such as extreme solar energy absorbers and broadband light trapping devices. This special 1 D optical Mie resonance can be enhanced by using semiconductor-core dielectric-shell (CS) and metal-core semiconductor-shell dielectric-outer shell (CSS) nanowire heterostructures. Those advantages can be even leveraged up by utilizing nanowire arrays, attributing to the increasing optical inter-wire interaction between incident light and nanostructures. ^ However, to form a very thin, vertical IIIV nanowire array is challenging for both conventional top-down and bottom-up approaches due to the limitation of the resolution of lithographically defined masks and thermodynamic limits of growth direction and diameter of nanowires, respectively. By employing nanoscale self-mask effects, those limitations can be circumvented. In this dissertation, we presented a novel top-down etching method to fabricate very thin, high aspect ratio and vertical III-V nanowire arrays without lithographically defined masks. The mechanism {{of the formation of}} nanowire arrays was proposed and verified by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in this work. Optical characterizations, such as optical reflectance and Raman spectroscopy, were also performed on those nanowire arrays. By employing those nanowire arrays, broadband light trapping can be achieved. ^ Besides, the effects of <b>contact</b> <b>electrodes,</b> such as indium tin oxide (ITO), silver, and copper, on semiconductor nanowire solar cell devices with different bandgaps were also investigated with a focus on optical absorption. Although traditional conductive oxide materials, such as indium tin oxide (ITO) and aluminum zinc oxide (AZO), have been successfully used in solar cell thin film devices, those conductive oxide <b>contact</b> <b>electrodes</b> will have different optical behavior applied in 1 D nanowire devices due to 1 D optical Mie resonance in nanowires.

40|$|Due to {{the high}} power density and local {{temperature}} increase on nanoscopic asperities of solid metal contacts, traditional MEMS contact switches suffer from contact welding, pitting, electromigration and oxidation. Particularly, when MEMS switches are used to handle high power, solid metal contacts pose serious limitation on the contact reliability. A self-healing RF MEMS switch, which utilizes liquid gallium Contacts {{to take the place}} of the traditional solid metal-to-metal contacts, is proposed in this paper. Electrostatic actuation is Used to drive a silicon nitride bridge with upper electrodes. When the bridge is pulled down, liquid gallium droplets work as an interface between the upper and lower <b>contact</b> <b>electrodes.</b> The loss of the gallium droplets can be avoided due to the Unwettability of the material surrounding the <b>contact</b> <b>electrodes.</b> The switch is fabricated using a surface tnicromachining process.

40|$|Terahertz {{technology}} has attracted extensive attention {{because of its}} unique applications in environmental monitoring, space explorations, chemical identification, material characterization, security screening, medical imaging, and biological sensing. In the meantime, the practical feasibility of many terahertz systems is still limited by the low power, low efficiency, and bulky nature of existing terahertz sources. Among various techniques for terahertz generation, photoconduction has demonstrated very promising performance for generating both pulsed and continuous-wave (CW) terahertz radiation. Compared to other optically driven terahertz emitters based on nonlinear optical processes, performance of photoconductive terahertz emitters is not constrained by the Manley–Rowe limit and, therefore, can offer significantly higher optical-to-terahertz conversion efficiencies. In spite of their great promise, the performance of existing photoconductive terahertz emitters is severely limited by poor quantum efficiency of ultrafast photoconductors. This limitation is mainly caused by inefficient collection {{of the majority of}} the photocarriers in a sub-picosecond time scale. To address this limitation, we introduce novel photoconductive terahertz source designs that incorporate plasmonic <b>contact</b> <b>electrodes</b> to offer significantly higher efficiencies compared to conventional designs. By utilizing plasmonic <b>contact</b> <b>electrodes,</b> a large portion of the incident optical pump beam is concentrated and absorbed in close proximity to the plasmonic <b>contact</b> <b>electrodes.</b> Therefore, the average transport path length of photo-generated carriers to the <b>contact</b> <b>electrodes</b> is greatly reduced. As a result, higher photocurrent levels are fed to the terahertz antenna within the oscillation cycle of the terahertz radiation and higher optical-to-terahertz conversion efficiencies are achieved. We demonstrate record-high optical-to-terahertz conversion efficiencies as high as 7. 5 %, exhibiting three orders of magnitude higher efficiencies compared to conventional designs. We also demonstrate CW terahertz generation with a radiation frequency tuning range of more than 2 THz and a radiation power of 17 μW at 1 THz, exhibiting a 3 -fold higher radiation power level compared to the state-of-the art.
