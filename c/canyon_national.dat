5|$|Lees Ferry is {{considered}} the official beginning of Grand <b>Canyon</b> <b>National</b> Park on the Colorado River and {{is used as a}} fishing area and river rafting launch site. The main access is by Lees Ferry Road, which splits off from U.S. Route 89 at the hamlet of Marble Canyon, Arizona, {{on the west side of}} the Navajo Bridges. The Lonely Dell Ranch Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 and expanded to include Lees Ferry in 1997, features several buildings built during and after John D. Lee's brief tenure at the site along with some remnants of the Charles H. Spencer. The area is managed by the National Park Service within the Glen <b>Canyon</b> <b>National</b> Recreation Area as a historical site.|$|E
5|$|Driving {{through the}} east side of Zion to U.S. Route 89 allows access to Bryce <b>Canyon</b> <b>National</b> Park in the north or to the north rim of the Grand Canyon in the south. Due to the narrowness of the Zion–Mount Carmel Tunnel, RVs and buses must obtain a special pass and can only drive through the tunnel during limited hours.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about early human {{habitation}} in the Bryce Canyon area. Archaeological surveys of Bryce <b>Canyon</b> <b>National</b> Park and the Paunsaugunt Plateau show {{that people have been}} in the area for at least 10,000years. Basketmaker Anasazi artifacts several thousand years old have been found south of the park. Other artifacts from the Pueblo-period Anasazi and the Fremont culture (up to the mid-12th century) have also been found.|$|E
5|$|Most caves {{created from}} {{dissolved}} rocks are formed in limestone or dolomite, but Oregon Caves {{was formed in}} marble.

50|$|The McInnis <b>Canyons</b> <b>National</b> Conservation Area (MCNCA) is a 123400 acre National Conservation Area {{located in}} Mesa County, west of Grand Junction, Colorado. The MCNCA has rugged {{sandstone}} canyons, natural arches, spires, and alcoves {{carved into the}} Colorado Plateau, through which runs a 24 mi stretch of the Colorado River. Included in the MCNCA is the 75500 acre Black Ridge Canyons Wilderness (BRCW) with 5200 acre extending into eastern Grand County, Utah at the MCNCA's western boundary.The MCNCA is managed by the Bureau of Land Management {{as part of the}} National Landscape Conservation System, and was officially designated on October 24, 2000, when the Colorado <b>Canyons</b> <b>National</b> Conservation Area and Black Ridge Canyons Wilderness Act of 2000 became Public Law 106-353. The NCA was renamed after Congressman Scott McInnis on January 1, 2005.|$|R

5|$|Flagstaff's early {{economy was}} based on the lumber, railroad, and {{ranching}} industries. Today, the city remains an important distribution hub for companies such as Nestlé Purina PetCare, and is home to Lowell Observatory, The U.S. Naval Observatory, the United States Geological Survey Flagstaff Station, and Northern Arizona University. Flagstaff has a strong tourism sector, due to its proximity to Grand <b>Canyon</b> <b>National</b> Park, Oak Creek Canyon, the Arizona Snowbowl, Meteor Crater, and historic Route 66. The city is also a center for medical device manufacturing, since Flagstaff is home to W. L. Gore and Associates.|$|E
5|$|Members of the United States Congress {{started work}} in 1924 on {{upgrading}} Bryce Canyon's protection status from a U.S. National Monument to a National Park {{in order to}} establish Utah National Park. A process led by the Utah Parks Company for transferring ownership of private and state-held land in the monument to the federal government started in 1923. The last of the land in the proposed park's borders was sold to the federal government four years later, and on February 25, 1928, the renamed Bryce <b>Canyon</b> <b>National</b> Park was established.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Staircase is {{an immense}} {{sequence}} of sedimentary rock layers that stretch south from Bryce <b>Canyon</b> <b>National</b> Park through Zion National Park {{and into the}} Grand Canyon. Within this sequence, the oldest exposed formation in the Zion and Kolob canyons area is the youngest exposed formation in the Grand Canyonthe Kaibab limestone. Bryce Canyon to the northeast continues where the Zion and Kolob areas end by presenting Cenozoic-aged rocks. In fact, the youngest formation seen in the Zion and Kolob area is the oldest exposed formation in Bryce Canyonthe Dakota Sandstone.|$|E

5|$|The exposed geology of the Bryce Canyon area in Utah shows {{a record}} of {{deposition}} that covers {{the last part of}} the Cretaceous Period and the first half of the Cenozoic era in that part of North America. The ancient depositional environment of the region around what is now Bryce <b>Canyon</b> <b>National</b> Park varied from the warm shallow sea (called the Cretaceous Seaway) in which the Dakota Sandstone and the Tropic Shale were deposited to the cool streams and lakes that contributed sediment to the colorful Claron Formation that dominates the park's amphitheaters.|$|E
5|$|The next year, Edgar Lee Hewett, {{president}} of New Mexico Normal University (later renamed New Mexico Highlands University), mapped many Chacoan sites. Hewett and others helped enact the Federal Antiquities Act of 1906, the first U.S. law to protect relics; it was, in effect, {{a direct consequence of}} Wetherill's controversial activities at Chaco. The Act also authorized the President to establish national monuments: on March 11, 1907, Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed Chaco <b>Canyon</b> <b>National</b> Monument. Wetherill relinquished his land claims.|$|E
5|$|With {{proximity}} to Grand <b>Canyon</b> <b>National</b> Park, {{the city also}} has a thriving travel and tourism industry, with numerous hotel and restaurant chains. The downtown area is home to two historic hotels, the Weatherford Hotel and the Hotel Monte Vista. The first hotel of the Ramada Inn chain opened in 1954 {{at the intersection of}} U.S. Routes 66, 89 and 89A adjacent to what was then Arizona State College (now Northern Arizona University). The original building is still intact, operating as a Super 8 Motel.|$|E

5|$|Expanding {{access to}} parks was {{a feature of}} many {{initiatives}} Jewell undertook as Secretary. A 2014 Secretarial Order set benchmarks to increase youth involvement, seeking to create opportunities {{for young people to}} play, learn, serve, and work in national parks. Jewell led the kickoff of the Every Kid Every Park program by leading fourth graders on a hike through Red Rock <b>Canyon</b> <b>National</b> Conservation Area. The Every Kid initiative made every fourth grade student, and their families, eligible for a free one-year pass to every national park. Jewell also backed a 2016 initiative to expedite permitting for youth organizations to explore public wild lands on overnight or multi-day trips, particularly in less popular parks.|$|E
5|$|North from Long Valley Junction, US-89 descends {{through the}} valley of the Sevier River, meeting SR-12, a scenic highway that leads to Bryce <b>Canyon</b> <b>National</b> Park, at Bryce Canyon Junction, SR-143 in Panguitch, and SR-20 at Bear Valley Junction. As the highway {{continues}} north, the valley narrows significantly into the Circleville Canyon before opening out near the town of Circleville. In this part of the valley, the Sevier River is dammed to create the Piute Reservoir, and US-89 meets SR-62 near Kingston. North of Marysvale, the valley again narrows into the Sevier Canyon, which carries the river to its confluence with Clear Creek and US-89 to its overlap with Interstate 70, beginning at Sevier.|$|E
5|$|The Ulysses S. Grant National Historic Site near St. Louis, {{and several}} other sites in Ohio and Illinois memorialize Grant's life. There are smaller {{memorials}} in Chicago's Lincoln Park and Philadelphia's Fairmount Park. Named in his honor are Grant Park, {{as well as several}} counties in western and midwestern states. On June 3, 1891, a bronze statue of Grant by Danish sculptor Johannes Gelert was dedicated at Grant Park in Galena, Illinois. From 1890 to 1940, part of what is now Kings <b>Canyon</b> <b>National</b> Park was called General Grant National Park, named for the General Grant sequoia.|$|E

5|$|The geology of the Grand Canyon area {{includes}} one of {{the most}} complete and studied sequences of rock on Earth. The nearly 40 major sedimentary rock layers exposed in the Grand Canyon and in the Grand <b>Canyon</b> <b>National</b> Park area range in age from about 200million to nearly 2billion years old. Most were deposited in warm, shallow seas and near ancient, long-gone sea shores in western North America. Both marine and terrestrial sediments are represented, including fossilized sand dunes from an extinct desert. There are at least 14 known unconformities in the geologic record found in the Grand Canyon.|$|E
5|$|Downtown Flagstaff lies {{immediately}} {{to the east of}} Mars Hill, the location of Lowell Observatory. Streets in the downtown area are laid out in a grid pattern, parallel to Route 66 and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Rail Line, running east–west through the city. Milton Road branches off from Route 66 west of downtown, and travels south, adjacent to the Northern Arizona University campus, to the junction of Interstate 17 and Interstate 40. Milton Road becomes I-17. A road called Beulah Boulevard, which also runs south, becomes State Route 89A, and travels through Oak Creek Canyon to Sedona. Traveling north from downtown, Fort Valley Road (U.S. 180) connects with the Museum of Northern Arizona, Arizona Snowbowl, and Grand <b>Canyon</b> <b>National</b> Park. Traveling east from downtown, Route 66 and the railroad run in parallel toward East Flagstaff (and beyond), at the base of Mount Elden. Much of Flagstaff's industry is located east of downtown, adjacent to the railroad tracks, as well as in East Flagstaff.|$|E
5|$|Eleven U.S. {{national}} parks – Arches, Black Canyon of the Gunnison, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, Grand Canyon, Mesa Verde, Petrified Forest, Rocky Mountain, Saguaro, and Zion – {{are in the}} watershed, in addition to many national forests, state parks, and recreation areas. Hiking, backpacking, camping, skiing, and fishing are among the multiple recreation opportunities offered by these areas. Fisheries have declined in many streams in the watershed, especially in the Rocky Mountains, because of polluted runoff from mining and agricultural activities. The Colorado's major reservoirs are also heavily traveled summer destinations. Houseboating and water-skiing are popular activities on Lakes Mead, Powell, Havasu, and Mojave, as well as Flaming Gorge Reservoir in Utah and Wyoming, and Navajo Reservoir in New Mexico and Colorado. Lake Powell and surrounding Glen <b>Canyon</b> <b>National</b> Recreation Area received more than twomillion visitors per year in 2007, while nearly 7.9million people visited Lake Mead and the Lake Mead National Recreation Area in 2008. Colorado River recreation employs some 250,000 people and contributes $26billion each year to the Southwest economy.|$|E
