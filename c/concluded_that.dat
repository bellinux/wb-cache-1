5|$|The Rivers Agency <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> the {{flooding}} was an extreme event, caused by weather {{that resulted in}} widespread flooding across Northern Ireland.

5|$|A 2013 {{study by}} the National Renewable Energy Laboratory <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> the average large {{photovoltaic}} plant in the United States occupied 3.1 acres of permanently disturbed area and 3.4 acres of total site area per gigawatt-hour per year. The average concentrated solar power plant in the US occupied 2.7 acres of disturbed area and 3.5 acres of total area per GWh/yr, A 2015 life-cycle analysis of land use for various sources of electricity <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> concentrating solar power had a land-use footprint of 9.0 m2/MWhr for trough, and 14 m2/MWhr for power tower. The concentrating solar footprint was smaller than that of coal power (18 m2/MWhr), but larger than the other sources studied, including ground photovoltaic (7.9 m2/MWhr), natural gas (0.49 m2/MWhr), and wind power (0.26 m2/MWhr).|$|E

5|$|A {{study by}} the Brazilian {{research}} unit of the Fundação Getúlio Vargas regarding the effects of biofuels on grain prices. <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> the major driver behind the 2007–2008 rise in food prices was speculative activity on futures markets under conditions of increased demand in a market with low grain stocks. The study also <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> expansion of biofuel production was not a relevant factor and also {{that there is no}} correlation between Brazilian sugarcane cultivated area and average grain prices, as on the contrary, the spread of sugarcane was accompanied by rapid growth of grain crops in the country.|$|E

5|$|Although Du Bois {{attended}} a New England Congregational {{church as a}} child, he abandoned organized religion while at Fisk College. As an adult, Du Bois described himself as agnostic or a freethinker, {{but at least one}} biographer <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> Du Bois was virtually an atheist.Lewis, p. 550 (agnostic, atheist).Johnson, passim (agnostic). However, another analyst of Du Bois's writings <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> he had a religious voice, albeit radically different from other African-American religious voices of his era, and inaugurated a 20th-century spirituality to which Ralph Ellison, Zora Neale Hurston, and James Baldwin also belong.|$|E

5|$|Analyses since 2001 have <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> Eumetazoa (more {{complex than}} sponges) are {{more closely related}} to {{particular}} groups of sponges than {{to the rest of the}} sponges. Such conclusions imply that sponges are not monophyletic, because the last common ancestor of all sponges would also be a direct ancestor of the Eumetazoa, which are not sponges. A study in 2001 based on comparisons of ribosome DNA <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> the most fundamental division within sponges was between glass sponges and the rest, and that Eumetazoa are {{more closely related to}} calcareous sponges, those with calcium carbonate spicules, than to other types of sponge. In 2007 one analysis based on comparisons of RNA and another based mainly on comparison of spicules <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> demosponges and glass sponges are more closely related to each other than either is to calcareous sponges, which in turn are more closely related to Eumetazoa.|$|E

5|$|By {{the start}} of the 20th century, {{developments}} in guns and armour had made most of the Device Forts that remained in service too small to be useful.

A 1905 review of the Falmouth defences <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> the naval artillery at St Mawes had become superfluous, as the necessary guns could be mounted at combination of Pendennis and newer sites along the coast, and the castle was disarmed. A review in 1913 <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> keeping naval artillery at Calshot was also unnecessary, and the site was turned into an experimental seaplane station instead.|$|E
