40|$|The chicken {{brain is}} more than twice as big as the bobwhite quail brain in adulthood. To {{determine}} how this species difference in brain size emerges during development, we examined whether differences in neurogenesis timing or cell <b>cycle</b> <b>rates</b> account for the disparity in brain size between chickens and quail. Specifically, we examined the timing of neural events (e. g. neurogenesis onset) from Nissl-stained sections of chicken and quail embryos. We estimated brain cell <b>cycle</b> <b>rates</b> using cumulative bromodeoxyuridine labelling in chickens and quail at embryonic day (ED) 2 and at ED 5. We report that the timing of neural events is highly conserved between chickens and quail, once time is expressed as a percentage of overall incubation period. In absolute time, neurogenesis begins earlier in chickens than in quail. Therefore, neural event timing cannot account for the expansion of the chicken brain relative to the quail brain. Cell <b>cycle</b> <b>rates</b> are also similar between the two species at ED 5. However, at ED 2, before neurogenesis onset, brain cells cycle faster in chickens than in quail. These data indicate that chickens have a larger brain than bobwhite quail mainly because of species differences in cell <b>cycle</b> <b>rates</b> during early stages of embryonic development...|$|R

40|$|Objective: 1 – To {{compare the}} <b>cycle</b> {{pregnancy}} <b>rate</b> of intrauterine insemination (IUI) {{to that of}} intrauterine tuboperitoneal insemination (IUTPI) in unexplained infertility. 2 – To assess the effect of timing of insemination in relation to ovulation on the <b>cycle</b> pregnancy <b>rate</b> of IUI and IUTPI. Design: Prospective randomized study. Main outcome measures: 1 – <b>Cycle</b> pregnancy <b>rate</b> of IUI and IUTPI. 2 – <b>Cycle</b> pregnancy <b>rate</b> of preovulatory and postovulatory insemination. Material and methods: Two groups (A and B), each group included 160 women with unexplained primary infertility. Group A were treated by IUI and group B by IUTPI after controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) with sequential clomiphene citrate and human menopausal gonadotropin. Ovulation was by i. m. HCG. At the time of insemination the occurrence of ovulation was checked by transvaginal sonography. Results: After the first treatment cycle 17 patients of group A (10. 62 %) and 28 patients of group B (17. 50 %) had ongoing pregnancies (p =  0. 0413). After the second treatment cycle 12 patients of group A (8. 39 %) and 18 patients of group B (19. 63 %) had ongoing pregnancies (p =  0. 0442). After the third treatment cycle 11 patients of group A (8. 39 %) and 14 patients of group B (12. 28 %) had ongoing pregnancies (p =  0. 0433). After the three treatment cycles 40 patients of group A (25 %) and 60 patients of group B (37. 50 %) had ongoing pregnancies (p =  0. 033) and the overall <b>cycle</b> pregnancy <b>rate</b> of group A was 9. 21 % and group B 14. 81 % (p =  0. 0324). In group A the <b>cycle</b> pregnancy <b>rate</b> of preovulatory insemination was 7. 20 % and postovulatory 9. 76 % (p =  0. 041). In group B the <b>cycle</b> pregnancy <b>rate</b> of preovulatory insemination was 17. 70 % and postovulatory 13. 0 % (p =  0. 0322).

In 1421 the future Charles VII of France commissioned a trebuchet (coyllar) that could shoot a stone of 800 kg, while in 1188 at Ashyun, rocks up to 1,500 kg were used.

50|$|The time allotted for UC {{traffic is}} {{dictated}} {{by the amount of}} data transmitted during the RT portion of the cycle. In real-world applications, there is a significant amount of bandwidth available for UC frames. For example, in a typical application with 8 axes of motion and a <b>cycle</b> <b>rate</b> of 250 µs, the equivalent of 85 Mbit/s is available for UC use. This amount of time means the UC frames in this example can be as long as the maximum defined for Ethernet (Maximum Transmission Unit MTU =1500). Using the same example of 8 axes, but with a cycle time of 62.5 µs, the effective bandwidth available for UC frames would be 40 Mbit/s, and the MTU would be reduced to 325. As with any network where time on the bus is shared, MTU values should be configured to ensure reliable communication. Properly configured Sercos networks will set the Sercos parameter “Requested MTU” (S-0-1027.0.1) to the recommended MTU value, which can then be read by other devices to match their MTU settings. Regardless of the value of this parameter, a Sercos node will allow non-Sercos traffic to pass for the entire UC channel time period (i.e., telegrams longer than the MTU setting are not discarded by the Sercos stack). Sercos parameter S-0-1027.0.1 is set by default to 576, the minimum value called out in RFC 791.|$|E
50|$|However, the {{standard}} does not specify any particular timing for any particular transfer — that's {{up to the}} system designers. Generally (the way it is done on most military aircraft), the Bus Controller has a schedule of transfers that covers the majority of transfers, often organized into a major frame or major cycle, which is often subdivided into minor cycles. In such a cyclic executive schedule structure, transfers that occur in every minor <b>cycle</b> (<b>rate</b> group 1) happen at the highest rate, typically 50 Hz, transfers that occur in every other minor cycle, {{of which there are}} two groups (rate group 2.1 and 2.2) happen at the next highest rate, e.g. 25 Hz. Similarly, there are four groups (3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4) at, e.g., 12.5 Hz and so on. Hence, where this scheduling structure is used, the transfers are all at harmonically related frequencies, e.g. 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, and 1.5625 Hz (for a major frame comprising 32 minor cycles at 50 Hz).Whilst RTs cannot start a transfer directly on their own, {{the standard}} does include a method for when an RT needs to transmit data that is not automatically scheduled by the Bus Controller. These transfers are often called acyclic transfers as they are outside the structure used by the cyclic executive. In this sequence, an RT requests transmission through a bit in the status word, the Service Request bit. Generally, this causes the Bus Controller to transmit a Transmit Vector Word Mode Code command. However, where an RT only has one possible acyclic transfer, the Bus Controller can skip this part. The vector word is transmitted by the RT as a single 16-bit data word. The format of this vector word is not defined in the standard, so the system designers must specify what values from what RTs mean what action the Bus Controller is to take. This may be to schedule an acyclic transfer either immediately or {{at the end of the}} current minor cycle. This means that the Bus Controller has to poll all the Remote Terminals connected to the data bus, generally at least once in a major cycle. RTs with higher-priority functions (for example, those operating the aircraft control surfaces) are polled more frequently. Lower-priority functions are polled less frequently.|$|E
