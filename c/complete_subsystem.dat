40|$|The Haj'os Calculus is a simple, nondeterministic {{procedure}} which {{generates the}} class of non- 3 -colorable graphs. Mansfield and Welsch [MW] posed {{the question of whether}} there exist graphs which require exponential-sized Haj'os constructions. Unless NP 6 = coNP, there must exist graphs which require exponential-sized constructions, but to date, little progress has been made on this question, despite considerable effort. In this paper, we prove that the Haj'os Calculus generates polynomial-sized constructions for all non- 3 -colorable graphs if and only if Extended Frege systems are polynomially bounded. Extended Frege systems are a very powerful family of proof systems for proving tautologies, and proving superpolynomial lower bounds for these systems is a long-standing, important problem in logic and complexity theory.

40|$|National Taiwan University The {{design of}} {{multiprocessor}} architectures differs from uniprocessor systems {{in that the}} number of processors and their interconnection must be considered. This leads to an enormous increase in the design-space exploration time, which is exponential in the total number of system components. The methodology proposed here, called Intelligent Concurrent Object-Oriented Synthesis (ICOS) methodology, makes feasible the synthesis of complex multiprocessor systems through the application of several techniques that speed up the design process. ICOS is based on Performance Synthesis Methodology (PSM), a recently proposed objectoriented system-level design methodology. Four major techniques: object-oriented design, fuzzy design-space exploration, concurrent design, and intelligent reuse of <b>complete</b> <b>subsystems</b> are integrated in ICOS. First, object-oriented modeling and design, through the use of object-oriented relationships and operators, make the whole design process manageable and maintainable in ICOS. Second, fuzzy comparison applied to the specializations or instances of components reduces the exponential growth of design-space exploration in ICOS. Third, independent components from different design alternatives are synthesized in parallel, this design concurrency shortens the overall design time. Lastly, the resynthesis of <b>complete</b> <b>subsystems</b> can be avoided through the application of learning, thus making the methodology intelligent enough to reuse previous design configurations. Experiments show that all these applied techniques contribute to the synthesis efficiency and the degree of automation in ICOS.

The process presented in this document has the intention of reducing the number of tasks needed to produce the final subsystem/product. To achieve this goal were combined several technologies, as in-mould assembling, laser welding and LEDs (light-emitting diode).

Traditionally, flight elements are <b>complete</b> <b>subsystems</b> requiring humans to complete the integration and assembly.

This philosophy necessitates a high degree of safety, numerous space walks at a significant cost. Future space mission costs must be reduced and safety increased to reasonably achieve exploration goals. One proposed concept is the autonomous assembly of space structures. This concept is an affordable, reliable solution to in-space and extraterrestrial assembly.
