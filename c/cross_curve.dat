40|$|We {{review the}} {{progress}} {{in understanding the}} processes near the separatrices during magnetic reconnection. The results are obtained from numerical simulation and spacecraft measurement. The reconnection separatrices represent the surface (<b>cross</b> <b>curve</b> in two-dimensional regime) separating the reconnected magnetic field lines from the reconnecting lines, and thereby connect to the reconnection X-line. The average properties of the particle distribution and physical processes in the separatrix region are summarized. Recent studies confirm that various instabilities occur in the separatrix region and lead to a complex interplay and affecting the plasma in this region. The microphysics in the separatrix region should {{play an important role}} in reconnection dynamics. Furthermore, electrons are accelerated up to 100 keV before they enter into the electron diffusion region: a significant part of energy conversion takes place in the separatrix region during reconnection. status: accepte...|$|E

A discrete toy model, which generalizes the well studied Mandelbrot model, reveals a rich phase structure.

This technique was extensively {{used in the}} XIXth and early XXth centuries in Europe for agriculture and development of transport networks. Although widespread, drystone structures remain largely unknown, and consequently, there are relatively few new constructions or even reconstructions of ancient structures in drystone. Over the past two decades, research studies in France and in the UK have been dedicated {{to a better understanding}} of the behaviour of drystone retaining walls. These studies have enabled the redaction of a good practice guide in 2008, including a first series of <b>cross</b> <b>curves</b> of stability. Ongoing on this project, the present work deals with the updating of the <b>cross</b> <b>curves,</b> based on recent research developments. The <b>cross</b> <b>curves</b> presented here rely on plain strain yield design modelling, enhanced with the information collected through full-scale experimental campaigns. The charts provide the minimum base thickness of the wall, given its height, its batter, the type of stones composing the wall, and the nature of the backfill. <b>Cross</b> <b>curves</b> of stability are intended to be incorporated into professional standards. The establishment of standards dedicated to drystone retaining walls should contribute to ensure a simple but reliable design, and thus support reconstructions and new constructions in drystone and enable the profession to develop...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFor {{the general}} linear scalar {{time-delay}} systems of arbitrary order with two delays, {{this article provides}} a detailed study on the stability <b>crossing</b> <b>curves</b> consisting of all the delays such that the characteristic quasipolynomial {{has at least one}} imaginary zero. The crossing set, consisting of all the frequencies corresponding to all the points in the stability <b>crossing</b> <b>curves,</b> are expressed in terms of simple inequality constraints and can be easily identified from the gain response curves of the coefficient transfer functions of the delay terms. This crossing set forms a finite number of intervals of finite length. The corresponding stability <b>crossing</b> <b>curves</b> form a series of smooth curves except at the points corresponding to multiple zeros {{and a number of other}} degenerate cases. These curves may be closed curves, open ended curves, and spiral-like curves oriented horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The category of curves are determined by which constraints are violated at the two ends of the corresponding intervals of the crossing set. The directions in which the zeros cross the imaginary axis are explicitly expressed. An algorithm may be devised to calculate the maximum delay deviation without changing the number of right half plane zeros of the characteristic quasipolynomial (and preservation of stability as a special case) ...|$|R

40|$|By a {{curve in}} R^d we mean a {{continuous}} map gamma:I -> R^d, where I is a closed interval. We call a curve gamma in R^d at most k crossing if it intersects every hyperplane at most k times (counted with multiplicity). The at most d <b>crossing</b> <b>curves</b> in R^d are often called convex curves and they form an important class; a primary {{example is the}} moment curve (t,t^ 2, [...] .,t^d) :t∈[0, 1]. They are also closely related to Chebyshev systems, which is a notion of considerable importance, e. g., in approximation theory. We prove that for every d there is M=M(d) such that every at most d+ 1 <b>crossing</b> <b>curve</b> in R^d can be subdivided into at most M convex curves. As a consequence, {{based on the work}} of Elias, Roldan, Safernova, and the second author, we obtain an essentially tight lower bound for a geometric Ramsey-type problem in R^d concerning order-type homogeneous sequences of points, investigated in several previous papers.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{studies the}} {{migration}} pattern of characteristic imaginary roots of multiplicity {{three and four}} in time-delay systems with two delays when the delay parameters undergo small deviations. Stability analysis for such problems is often based on Puiseux series, as multiple roots are not differentiable with respect to delay parameters. However, in this paper the approach is more traditional without using Puiseux series. In the case of triple roots, we show that the stability <b>crossing</b> <b>curves</b> are smooth; when a perturbation occurs in the delay parameter space, two roots move to one half-plane and one root to the other half-plane. The case of quadruple root is more complicated as the stability <b>crossing</b> <b>curve</b> has a cusp. Thus, in the neighbourhood of the critical point, the delay parameter space is divided in an S-sector and a G-sector. When the parameters move into the G-sector, two roots move to the right half-plane, {{and the other two}} roots move to the left half-plane. When the parameters move into the S-sector, then three of the roots move to one half-plane, and the remaining root moves to the other half-plane, depending on the conditions...|$|R
