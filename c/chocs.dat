40|$|We {{address the}} {{specification}} and verification problem for process calculi such as <b>Chocs,</b> CML and Facile where processes or functions are transmissible values.

This result is a non-trivial extension of the classical characterization result for labelled transition systems.

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} two Calculi for Higher Order Communicating Systems. Both calculi consider sending {{and receiving}} processes {{to be as}} fundamental as nondeterminism and parallel composition. The first calculus called <b>CHOCS</b> {{is an extension of}} Milner's CCS in the sense that all the constructions of CCS are included or may be derived from more fundamental constructs. Most of the mathematical framework of CCS carries over almost unchanged. The operational semantics of <b>CHOCS</b> is given as a labelled transition system and it is a direct extension of the semantics of CCS with value passing. A set of algebraic laws satisfied by the calculus is presented. These are similar to the CCS laws only introducing obvious extra laws for sending and receiving processes. The power of process passing is underlined by a result showing that the recursion operator is unnecessary in the sense that recursion can be simulated by means of process passing and communication. The <b>CHOCS</b> language is also studied by means of a denotational semantics. A major result is the full abstractness of this semantics with respect to the operational semantics. The denotational semantics is used to provide an easy proof of the simulation of recursion. Introducing processes as first class objects yields a powerful metalanguage. It is shown {{that it is possible to}} simulate various reduction strategies of the untyped λ-Calculus in <b>CHOCS.</b> As pointed out by Milner, CCS has its limitations when one wants to describe unboundedly expanding systems, e. g. an unbounded number of procedure invocations in an imperative concurrent programming language P with recursive procedures. <b>CHOCS</b> may neatly describe both call-by-value and call-by-reference parameter mechanisms for P. We also consider call-by-name and lazy parameter mechanisms for P. The second calculus is called Plain <b>CHOCS.</b> Essential to the new calculus is the treatment of restriction as a static binding operator on port names. This calculus is given an operational semantics using labelled transition systems which combines ideas from the applicative transition systems described by Abramsky and the transition systems used for <b>CHOCS.</b> This calculus enjoys algebraic properties which are similar to those of <b>CHOCS</b> only needing obvious extra laws for the static nature of the restriction operator. Processes as first class objects enable description of networks with changing interconnection structure and there is a close connection between the Plain <b>CHOCS</b> calculus and the π-Calculus described by Milner, Parrow and Walker: the two calculi can simulate one another. Recently object oriented programming has grown into a major discipline in computational practice as well as in computer science. From a theoretical point of view object oriented programming presents a challenge to any metalanguage since most object oriented languages have no formal semantics. We show how Plain <b>CHOCS</b> may be used to give a semantics to a prototype object oriented language called 0. Open Acess...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we study the Calculus of Higher Order Communicating Systems (<b>CHOCS)</b> (Thomsen, Proc. of POPL’ 89, ACM, 1989, pp. 143 – 154; Inform.

We present a {{construction}} of a denotational semantics for <b>CHOCS</b> which resides in a domain constructed using the standard constructions of separated sum, Cartesian product, the Plotkin power domain constructor and recursively defined domains. We show, under mild restrictions, that the denotational semantics and the operational semantics of <b>CHOCS</b> are fully abstract.

After {{reduction and}} esterification, <b>CHOC</b> 60 was further converted into cyclohexyl acetate functional fullerene mono-adduct, named as CHAC(60), which showed excellent solubility in common organic solvents. P 3 HT-based bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs) were fabricated through a typical structure of ITO/ PEDOT:PSS/P 3 HT:(CHOC 60 or CHAC(60)) /Ca/Al. The composite ratios of P 3 HT and the fullerene derivatives were modified such as 1 : 0. 5, 1 : 1 and 1 : 1. 5 (w/w). The devices fabricated using <b>CHOC</b> 60 or CHAC(60) as acceptors achieved the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 2. 97 % and 3. 15 %, respectively, which exhibited comparative photovoltaic performances with commercial PC 61 BM.

40|$|Congruence proofs for bisimulation equivalences on higher-order process calculi {{tend to be}} {{significantly}} more complex {{than their counterparts in}} first-order process algebra frameworks. The fact that higher-order synchronization invokes substitution seems to be the main problem. The reason is that it renders standard first-order proof techniques circular in the higher-order case, and this situation is difficult to deal with. Moreover, some techniques that allow us to cover strong forms of bisimulation equivalence on higher-order calculi seem to fail for the corresponding weak forms. Applicative simulation equivalence on -calculi poses similar problems and our starting point is that Howe has invented a general and elegant technique for solving them. Our contribution is that we use Howe-style techniques to prove that three forms of weak bisimulation equivalence on variants of Thomsen's Plain <b>CHOCS</b> and <b>CHOCS</b> second-order process calculi are congruences.
