5000|$|The {{high voltage}} also enables a bus {{topology}} in which panels are {{connected in parallel}} rather than in series. A parallel architecture allows {{a greater number of}} panels to be connected on a single cable run (which can include more than 100 thin-film panels), an increase over conventional series-string design. [...] Furthermore, eIQ Energy's Parallel Solar architecture eliminates the need for a return line, and because each vBoost comes with an integrated wiring harness and connector, the only on-site wiring needed is from the first vBoost to the <b>combiner</b> <b>box</b> and from the <b>combiner</b> <b>box</b> to the inverter.|$|E
40|$|While the 2011 National Electrical Code%C 2 %AE (NEC) only {{requires}} series arc-fault protection, some arc-fault circuit interrupter (AFCI) {{manufacturers are}} designing products {{to detect and}} mitigate both series and parallel arc-faults. Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) has extensively investigated the electrical differences of series and parallel arc-faults and has offered possible classification and mitigation solutions. As part of this effort, Sandia National Laboratories has collaborated with MidNite Solar to create and test a 24 -string <b>combiner</b> <b>box</b> with an AFCI which detects, differentiates, and de-energizes series and parallel arc-faults. In {{the case of the}} MidNite AFCI prototype, series arc-faults are mitigated by opening the PV strings, whereas parallel arc-faults are mitigated by shorting the array. A range of different experimental series and parallel arc-fault tests with the MidNite <b>combiner</b> <b>box</b> were performed at the Distributed Energy Technologies Laboratory (DETL) at SNL in Albuquerque, NM. In all the tests, the prototype de-energized the arc-faults in the time period required by the arc-fault circuit interrupt testing standard, UL 1699 B. The experimental tests confirm series and parallel arc-faults can be successfully mitigated with a combiner box-integrated solution...|$|E
40|$|An {{analog signal}} {{pre-processing}} scheme was developed, {{in the framework}} of the Fermilab Main Injector Beam Position Monitor (BPM) Upgrade, to interface BPM pickup signals to the new digital receiver based read-out system. A key component is the 8 -channel electronics module, which uses separate frequency selective gain stages to acquire 53 MHz bunched proton, and 2. 5 MHz anti-proton signals. Related hardware includes a filter and <b>combiner</b> <b>box</b> to sum pickup electrode signals in the tunnel. A controller module allows local/remote control of gain settings and activation of gain stages, and supplies test signals. Theory of operation, system overview, and some design details are presented, as well as first beam measurements of the prototype hardware...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Faults in the DC {{collector}} circuits of a photovoltaic plant are a {{cause for}} major concern due to the damage they may cause to equipment. Fault protection is required for ground faults, line-to-line faults and arc faults. Typically, the magnitude of short-circuit currents of PV modules are {{similar to that of}} load currents which makes fault detection and protection difficult to carry out on the DC system. The DC collectors of a PV plant consist of <b>combiner</b> <b>boxes</b> where PV arrays are connected and inverter DC buses where <b>combiner</b> <b>boxes</b> are connected. This paper investigates the fault contribution from the PV modules on the <b>combiner</b> <b>boxes</b> and inverter DC buses in relation to typical PV module data on an isolated section of the DC network of a plant using the ETAP simulation tool. A fault detection and protection scheme for the main faults in a DC PV system is proposed based on previous research, for complete protection of the DC collector circuits...|$|R
