5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, working in Hanford and Savannah River Sites, Reines and Cowan {{developed}} {{the equipment and}} procedures with which they first detected the supposedly undetectable neutrinos in June 1956. Reines dedicated the major part of his career {{to the study of}} the neutrino's properties and interactions, which work would influence study of the neutrino for many researchers to <b>come.</b> <b>This</b> included the detection of neutrinos created in the atmosphere by cosmic rays, and the 1987 detection of neutrinos emitted from Supernova SN1987A, which inaugurated the field of neutrino astronomy.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} role in the Clan is that of the leader. The Clan leader overlooks all duties of Clan life, and will make all the important decisions, such as whether or not to engage in battle. Each Clan leader is given nine lives by StarClan, in order to sacrifice their lives nine times over to protect their Clan, and to serve their clans for many more moons to <b>come.</b> <b>This</b> means that Clan leaders can often live longer than that of a normal cat. To mark their new status, Clan leaders are given the suffix –star (e.g. Bluestar, Tallstar, and Brokenstar). Generally, Clan leaders sleep alone, although male leaders are allowed to take a mate. Female leaders are inhibited from taking a mate or having kits, which has led to discussions of sexism among many fans of the series.|$|E

25|$|The {{spread of}} Christianity has been international, {{in some cases}} entirely {{displacing}} the religions and altering the customs encountered among those people to whom it has <b>come.</b> <b>This</b> centuries-long process has been met with violent opposition at times, and likewise the spread of Christianity has in some cases been carried out with martial force. The relationship of Christianity to other faiths is encumbered to some extent by this history, with modern Christians, particularly in the West, expressing embarrassment over the violence in Christianity's past.|$|E
25|$|Obama and Zapatero met {{face-to-face}} for {{the first}} time on April 2, 2009, at the G20 London Summit. Both leaders participated in the NATO Summit in Strasbourg-Kehl, where Spain committed an additional 450 troops to its previous military contingent of 778 in Afghanistan. Commentators said the decision may have been partially motivated by the Zapatero government's desire to curry favor with the new administration in Washington. Days later at the EU-U.S. Summit in Prague the two held a 45-minute meeting, and afterwards shared a photo-op for the press, where Obama called Zapatero a friend, and said he thinks that the two nations would establish an even stronger relationship in the years to <b>come.</b> <b>This</b> was the first formal meeting between heads of government of Spain and the United States since 2004.|$|E

This could not be done without the support of all the community and the help of the DC Commission and the Restaurant and all the entities who funded the project. I hope that this mural will become a teaching tool of the History of the Presidents for schools, children and the public in general. This is a gift to the City of Washington DC to celebrate this historical moment in American History and will remain open to the public to see for generations to <b>come.</b> <b>This</b> is fulfilling the idea that mural art is available for the public and for the masses.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the breach, the Israeli commander, Shimon Forsher, ordered all {{residents}} to retreat to an inner defensive perimeter. At this stage, the Egyptians took control of another line of structures, and entered a stalemate with the Israelis about 30m away from the inner perimeter. At 10:40 Be'erot Yitzhak reported that its fences had been breached from three directions and were within range of hand grenades. The Israeli commander was wounded, and his deputy was killed. In a battle for the nursery school, an Israeli PIAT managed to drive out the Egyptian soldiers. Another building was also hit by a PIAT, making the Egyptians withdraw. Despite the successful counterattack, at 11:15 the village reported that its situation was critical and they would surrender in half an hour if help would not <b>come.</b> <b>This</b> was repeated at least twice more during the battle.|$|E

[...] He also said that he was looking for statements to take out, but decided to leave the bulletin more or less intact because it seemed valid for a storm that he was convinced would be [...] "the big one" [...] longtime New Orleans residents had been predicting for some time.

500|$|The {{subject of}} Eliot's poem {{is drawn from}} the second chapter of the Gospel of Luke (...) , and the early Christian canticle Nunc dimittis derived from it. In Luke's account, Simeon, an aged and devout Jew, stands in the Temple of Jerusalem at the time Mary and Joseph bring the infant Jesus to be {{presented}} in the temple forty days after his birth in accordance with Jewish law and custom. Luke states that Simeon is [...] "waiting for the consolation of Israel" [...] after being promised that [...] "he should not see death before {{he had seen the}} Lord's Christ". (...) Simeon, upon seeing the child, takes him into his arms and prays, prophesizing the redemption of the world by Jesus and of suffering to <b>come.</b> <b>This</b> prayer would become known later as the Nunc dimittis from its Latin incipit.|$|E

500|$|In both 1932 and 1933, Mitchell-Innes captained the Sedbergh School cricket team, and {{was invited}} to play at Lord's Cricket Ground for {{representative}} school sides, and he also made eight further County Championship appearances for Somerset. He failed to make a mark for the county in 1932, recording a batting average of 6.50, but in 1933 he achieved his first half-century in first-class cricket, scoring 57 against Warwickshire, before hitting his own wicket. In a review of their cricket side in July 1933, The Sedberghian says of Mitchell-Innes that [...] "such cricketers seldom <b>come</b> <b>this</b> way", praising his consistency, fielding and captaincy, though it does note that [...] his off drive often failed to score him boundaries, and that his bowling lacked accuracy at times. Mitchell-Innes also played fives and rugby for the school, and {{was president of the}} debating society. On completion of his studies at Sedbergh, he won an exhibition to study Law at Brasenose College, Oxford.|$|E
500|$|Those reviewers who {{singled out}} the show's final segment, set after {{the return to}} Ohio, did so with compliments. Poniewozik wrote that the episode [...] "did a really fine job {{handling}} its epilogue, in which New Directions had their hopes crushed, went back to Lima—and {{found that it was}} a pretty awesome experience regardless. Brittany connected with Santana, a brief scene that reminded me how far both characters have <b>come</b> <b>this</b> season. Kurt didn't get a championship, but he has Blaine, and he has a taste of what life can be like for him after graduation." [...] Canning said it was a [...] "nice denouement, putting everyone at peace for having failed to reach the top ten at Nationals and getting their hopes high for next year." [...] Hankinson credited Brittany with some of the funniest lines in the episode as well as the most important scene—in the epilogue with Santana—and he was impressed with her lead vocals throughout. He concluded, [...] "She's the M.V.P. of the night and possibly the season." ...|$|E
500|$|Erin Martin of PopMatters {{said that}} [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] had euphoric properties. Martin said {{the song was}} [...] "a classic, triumphant dance number, and Rowland's {{powerhouse}} vocals ensure that this song has anthemic potential for years to <b>come.</b> <b>This</b> song just feels good to listen to". She {{also noted that the}} song was central to the concept and [...] "love-spreading message [...] Guetta delivers on the album as a whole." [...] David Balls of Digital Spy agreed with the song's anthem credentials. [...] " [...] is further evidence that Rowland may no longer be resigned to living in Beyoncé [...] shadow. Fusing classic dance beats with a heady, emotionally charged vocal, it's a world away from the mid-tempo R numbers with which she started her solo career. In fact, this packs a punch from the very first listen, meaning it could well become one of the summer anthems of 2009." [...] However, Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times was less impressed than the other critics, simply noting the song as [...] "a cheesy synthpop makeover of Coldplay's 'Clocks'." [...] Wood did however state that it was among Guetta's best work and was an example of when the DJ is [...] "most commercial".|$|E
