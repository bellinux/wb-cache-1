5|$|Carbon-14 {{is formed}} in upper {{layers of the}} {{troposphere}} and the stratosphere at altitudes of 9–15km by a reaction that is precipitated by cosmic rays. Thermal neutrons are produced that <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> the nuclei of nitrogen-14, forming carbon-14 and a proton. As such, 1.2 × 1010% of atmospheric carbon dioxide contains carbon-14.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the black}} boxes and {{communication}} transcripts were obtained, the investigators interviewed the ExcelAire's flight crew {{and the air}} traffic controllers, trying {{to piece together the}} scenario which allowed two modern jet aircraft, equipped with the latest anti-collision gear, to <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> each other while on instrument flights in positive control airspace.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the Solar System's {{existence}} the orbits of comets are unstable and eventually dynamics dictate that a comet must either <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> the Sun or a planet or else be ejected from the Solar System by planetary perturbations.|$|E
5|$|The small inner moons {{constantly}} perturb each other. The {{system is}} chaotic and apparently unstable. Simulations {{show that the}} moons may perturb each other into crossing orbits, which may eventually result in collisions between the moons. Desdemona may <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> either Cressida or Juliet within the next 100million years.|$|E
5|$|About 10 to 20 {{white-tailed deer}} {{per square mile}} (2.6 to 5.2 deer per square kilometer) live along {{the river and the}} parkway, more than the {{ecosystem}} can carry. They eat low-lying plants, shrubs, and tree saplings, reducing the food supply for smaller animals. The deer also <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> cars—in Hastings, about 1.6 times per month.|$|E

Everyone works to access the cannon's core and neutralize the ARK using the Master Emerald.|$|E
5|$|Since the crash, {{there have}} been several other {{accidents}} involving reverse thrust. A Douglas DC-8 operating United Airlines Flight 859 crashed in 1961 when the first officer attempted to reverse all four engines during the landing roll. The left engines remained in forward thrust, while the right engines went into reverse, causing the aircraft to veer rapidly to the right and <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> airport construction vehicles, killing 17 of the 122 people aboard and 1 person on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Some of the charged {{particles}} do {{get into the}} magnetosphere. These spiral around field lines, bouncing {{back and forth between}} the poles several times per second. In addition, positive ions slowly drift westward and negative ions drift eastward, giving rise to a ring current. This current reduces the magnetic field at the Earth's surface. Particles that penetrate the ionosphere and <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> the atoms there give rise to the lights of the aurorae and also emit X-rays.|$|E

5|$|After {{graduating from}} Cornell, O'Neill {{accepted}} {{a position as}} an instructor at Princeton University. There he started his research into high-energy particle physics. In 1956, his second year of teaching, he published a two-page article that theorized that the particles produced by a particle accelerator could be stored {{for a few seconds}} in a storage ring. The stored particles could then be directed to <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> another particle beam. This would increase the energy of the particle collision over the previous method, which directed the beam at a fixed target. His ideas were not immediately accepted by the physics community.|$|E
5|$|As this {{scenario}} continues, by 100 million {{years from the}} present the continental spreading will have reached its maximum extent and the continents will then begin to coalesce. In 250 million years, North America will <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> Africa while South America will wrap around {{the southern tip of}} Africa. The result will be the formation of a new supercontinent (sometimes called Pangaea Ultima), with the Pacific Ocean stretching across half the planet. The continent of Antarctica will reverse direction and return to the South Pole, building up a new ice cap.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{conservation}} of angular momentum, the nebula spun faster as it collapsed. As the material within the nebula condensed, the atoms within it began to <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> increasing frequency, converting their kinetic energy into heat. The centre, {{where most of the}} mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc. Over about 100,000 years, the competing forces of gravity, gas pressure, magnetic fields, and rotation caused the contracting nebula to flatten into a spinning protoplanetary disc with a diameter of about 200AU and form a hot, dense protostar (a star in which hydrogen fusion has not yet begun) at the centre.|$|E
5|$|By mid-August 1941, Empire Simba, with a {{completely}} new crew, had been repaired enough to set out in a Liverpool – Freetown convoy, but evidently returned to Liverpool the same day. After making her way to Oban on 9 September, she began the first of seven roundtrips to Freetown over the next 18 months, including convoy SL 125. Twice, when setting out with convoys, Empire Simba {{had to return to}} port with unspecified problems. In a third convoy sailing, a problem with her steering gear caused her to <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> another convoy ship, Empire Scott, and on 1 August Empire Simba straggled and dropped out of the convoy.|$|E
5|$|Destruction and {{encroachment}} {{of habitat}} by humans is another threat to loggerhead sea turtles. Optimum nesting beaches are open-sand beaches above the high-tide line. However, beach development deprives them of suitable nesting areas, {{forcing them to}} nest closer to the surf. Urbanization often leads to the siltation of sandy beaches, decreasing their viability. Construction of docks and marinas can destroy near-shore habitats. Boat traffic and dredging degrades habitat and can also injure or kill turtles when boats <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> turtles {{at or near the}} surface.|$|E

5|$|In the 1950s, the {{numbering}} grid {{for the new}} Interstate Highway System {{was established}} as intentionally opposite from the US grid insofar as the direction the route numbers increase. Interstate Highway numbers increase from west-to-east and south-to-north, to keep identically numbered routes geographically apart {{in order to keep}} them from being confused with one another, and it omits 50 and 60 which would potentially <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> US50 and US60. Both highway systems still number the routes ending in odd numbers north–south and the even-numbered highways run east–west, although the Interstate System labels its main north–south highways with numbers ending in 5, rather than 1.|$|E
5|$|Players {{navigate}} the knight to <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> enemies. The elevation {{of an enemy}} {{in relation to the}} player's knight determines the outcome of the collision. If the protagonist is higher than the enemy, the villain is defeated and vice versa. A collision of equal elevations results in the two knights bouncing off each other. A defeated enemy will turn into an egg that falls toward the bottom of the screen, which a player can collect for points. An egg that sits on a platform long enough will hatch into a new knight; if the player does not pick him up, he will gain a new mount and must be defeated again.|$|E

If the protagonist is higher than the enemy, the villain is defeated and vice versa. A collision of equal elevations results in the two knights bouncing off each other. Joust 2 introduced a transformation ability that morphs the player's bird into a pegasus, which provides better offensive capabilities while on ground but poor flight capabilities. A second player can join the game. The two players can either cooperatively complete the waves or attack each other while competitively defeating enemies.|$|E
50|$|The {{second step}} in the {{formation}} of Pangaea was the collision of Gondwana with Euramerica. By Silurian time, 440 Ma, Baltica had already <b>collided</b> <b>with</b> Laurentia, forming Euramerica. Avalonia had not yet <b>collided</b> <b>with</b> Laurentia, but as Avalonia inched towards Laurentia, the seaway between them, a remnant of the Iapetus Ocean, was slowly shrinking. Meanwhile, southern Europe broke off from Gondwana and began to move towards Euramerica across the newly formed Rheic Ocean. It <b>collided</b> <b>with</b> southern Baltica in the Devonian, though this microcontinent was an underwater plate. The Iapetus Ocean's sister ocean, the Khanty Ocean, shrank as an island arc from Siberia <b>collided</b> <b>with</b> eastern Baltica (now part of Euramerica). Behind this island arc was a new ocean, the Ural Ocean.|$|R
5|$|On 9 August 1920, a {{passenger}} train <b>collided</b> <b>with</b> the buffers. Two people were injured.
