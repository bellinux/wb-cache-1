40|$|ANY GENERAL {{history of}} {{psychiatry}} between, say, the Renaissance {{and the end}} of the nineteenth century would likely stress, among other things, the following two points. First, that during this period there was a growing acceptance, both within the medical community and among the general public, that certain behavioural patterns, and certain kinds of mental states, are the result of disease, and hence are the proper objects of medical description and treatment; this instead of the ascription of these queer ways of acting or thinking to such things as the possession by daemons, a state of sin or wilful criminality. Second, a growing acceptance, again among both physicians and laymen, that the mind is the function of the brain, that a phrase like "mental physiology " is not a contradiction in terms, and that while perhaps it is not equivalent to "cerebral physiology " the two processes are so closely linked that the one cannot be properly understood without reference to the other. This <b>commitment</b> <b>received</b> its fullest expression in the school of German somatic psychiatrists of the last half of the nineteenth century, the school of Griesinger, Meynert and Wernicke, a group that Ackerknecht has called the "brain psychiatrists". &apos...|$|E
40|$|Customer service {{employees}} (N = 386) {{from a variety}} of service-based organizations (e. g., hotels, restaurants, and retail stores) were sampled in a cross-sectional design to assess the construct validity and predictive utility of measures of: (a) perceptions of organizational support, (b) organizational commitment, (c) job satisfaction, (d) intent to quit, and (e) life satisfaction and to assess the appropriateness of use and the impact of these scales within a service-based context. The construct validity of the measures was assessed through the application of confirmatory factor analysis, while the predictive character of the proposed path models was assessed using path analysis. Results indicated that the measures of job satisfaction, intent to quit, and life satisfaction demonstrated acceptable construct validity within the service context sampled, while the measures of organizational support and <b>commitment</b> <b>received</b> mixed support due to problems with measurement error and item specification. The analyses of the path models revealed that: (a) perceived organizational support strongly and significantly influenced job satisfaction and organizational commitment, (b) job satisfaction had a unidirectional impact upon life satisfaction, (c) despite a strong correlation, job satisfaction displayed a limited predictive impact on organizational commitment, and (d) intent to quit was influenced by both job satisfaction and organizational commitment...|$|E
40|$|Population {{radiation}} dose commitments have been estimated from reported radionuclide releases from commercial power reactors operating during 1977. Fifty-year dose commitments from a one-year exposure were calculated from both liquid and atmospheric releases for four population groups (infant, child, teen-ager and adult) residing between 2 and 80 km from each site. This report tabulates {{the results of}} these calculations, showing the dose commitments for both liquid and airborne pathways for each age group and organ, Also included for each site is a histogram showing the fraction of the total population within 2 to 80 km around each site receiving various average dose commitments from the airborne pathways. The total dose commitment from both liquid and airborne pathways ranged from a high of 220 person-rem to a low of 0. 003 person-rem with an arithmetic mean of 16 person-rem. The total population dose for all sites was estimated at 700 person-rem for the 92 million people considered at risk. The average individual dose commitment from all pathways on a site basis ranged from a low of 2 x 10 {sup - 5 } mrem to a high of 0. 1 mrem. No attempt was made in this study to determine the maximum dose <b>commitment</b> <b>received</b> by any one individual from the radionuclides released at any of the sites...|$|E
