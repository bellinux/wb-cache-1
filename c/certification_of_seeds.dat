50|$|The ELISA is {{considered}} to be a safe, inexpensive and rapid method for detection of plant viruses. The inexpensive nature and relative simplicity thereof allows for it to be used as a workhorse within the agricultural sector and is used to screen thousands of samples per year. Unfortunately ELISAs are notcompletely failsafe. Virus levels within potato tubers, which are screened by ELISA for use as seed potatoes, are normally low while the tubers are dormant. ELISA detection of viruses in these potatoes is difficult and absorbance values may fall below the set cut-off value. For this reason, seed tuber screening is performed on sprouting rather than dormant tubers. Although this results in more reliable readings than direct tuber testing, it does delay the <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> potatoes. Another disadvantage of an immuno-based detection method is that changes at the gene level may have an influence on the immunogenicity of the antigen to be detected. In terms of potato plant viruses, mutations within the CP gene may cause the CP to undergo conformational changes rendering antibodies produced against the previously present virus less effective.|$|R

40|$|In {{the scope}} of a {{research}} project, official data from the <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> organic <b>seed</b> in Austria from 1999 to 2007 were analysed to determine {{the most important factors}} effecting seed quality and leading to rejection <b>of</b> <b>certification.</b> Data from 4684 seed multiplication fields and 3262 seed lots were analysed. Weed seeds and wild oats (Avena fatua) have little effect on the quality <b>of</b> finished <b>seed</b> due to highly effective seed processing plants and risk-based seed testing. In cereal seeds the most frequent reason for rejection <b>of</b> <b>certification</b> in the category Other Seeds by Number is Other Cereal Seeds. An important criterion resulting in frequent non-certification <b>of</b> organic <b>seed</b> is the level of infection from seed-borne and seed-transmitted diseases. Although the field inspection data show only {{a very small number of}} multiplication fields with evidence of relevant seed-borne diseases, those diseases were nevertheless identified at a higher rate in the finished seed lots. Especially loose smut (Ustilago nuda) and leaf stripe (Drechslera graminea) on spring barley as well as bunt (Tilletia caries) have been increasing in Austria during the period studied. The main reasons for this development were nearby fields that harboured these diseases due to use of poor quality farm saved seed...|$|R

40|$|Seeds are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used regeneration material for reforestation purpose; hence interest in “precision sowing” among nurseries is high due to the high cost of containerized seedling production. In addition, the increased interest in growing hybrid larch in commercial forestry has raised concerns about the purity <b>of</b> hybrid larch <b>seed</b> lots, as there are large proportions <b>of</b> pure parental <b>seeds</b> mixed with hybrid larch seed lots. The aims of the studies presented in this thesis were to evaluate the application of visible (Vis) and/or near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy combined with multivariate modelling for sorting filled-viable, empty and petrified <b>seeds</b> <b>of</b> Larix sibirica Ledeb., verification of hybrid larch, Larix × eurolepis Henry <b>seeds,</b> identification <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> <b>of</b> Betula pendula Roth and Betula pubescens Ehrh., and authentication of the origin of Picea abies (L.) Karst seed lots. For these purposes, reflectance spectra were recorded on single seeds using XDS Rapid Content Analyzer (FOSS NIRSystems, Inc.) from 400 – 2500 nm with a resolution of 0. 5 nm, and multivariate classification models were developed. The results showed that filled-viable, empty and petrified <b>seeds</b> <b>of</b> L. sibirica can be sorted with 98 %, 82 % and 87 % accuracies, respectively. When the seed lot was sorted into viable and non-viable (empty and petrified combined) classes, the predicted class membership reached 100 % for both classes. The technique could separate the hybrid larch seeds from pure parental seeds with 100 % accuracy. <b>Seeds</b> <b>of</b> B. pubescens and B. pendula were differentiated with 100 % and 99 % classification accuracy, respectively. Also, the overall classification accuracy among three B. pendula families was 93 % and that of B. pubescens was 98 %. NIR spectroscopy discriminated Swedish, Finnish, Norwegian, Polish and Lithuanian <b>seed</b> lots <b>of</b> P. abies with 92 % - 100 % accuracy. Absorption bands that were accounted for distinguishing the various seed lots examined in this thesis were attributed to differences in seed color, moisture content and chemical composition <b>of</b> the <b>seeds,</b> presumably polysaccharides, proteins and fatty acids, which are the common seed storage reserves. The findings demonstrate the feasibility of Vis + NIR spectroscopy as a robust technique for sorting seed lots according to their viability and for <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> lots by species and origin. Thus, concerted efforts should be made to scale-up the technique to on-line sorting system for large-scale tree seed handling operations...|$|R

40|$|The paper reviews tree {{seed and}} {{seedling}} supply systems in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and Latin America. Across these regions, the review {{found that some}} of the germplasm supply systems do not efficiently meet farmers’ demands and environmental expectations in terms of productivity, species and genetic diversity. In some countries, germplasm used is mostly sourced from undocumented sources and often untested. Germplasm quality control systems are only found in a few countries. Appreciation of the value of tree germplasm of high genetic quality is low. Non-government organisations (NGOs) in many African countries play a prominent role in the supply of germplasm which is usually given to farmers without charge. The practice of giving farmers free germplasm by NGOs in many African countries and also government participation in germplasm supply in some Asian countries has been blamed for crowding out private entrepreneurs, although this is not substantiated by any evidence to suggest that the smallholder farmers are willing and able to pay for the germplasm. In some Latin American countries, private companies, government and NGOs provide farmers tree germplasm in a partnership in which farmers provide land and labour in return. Overall, tree germplasm markets are large in Asia, due in part to large afforestation programs, intermediate in Latin America and small in Africa where smallholder farmers constitute the market. In countries where germplasm quality control is practiced, it is either through a legal framework or voluntary. A few countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America have developed protocols for <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> tree <b>seeds</b> based on the OECD. Some germplasm suppliers use branding as a way of differentiating their germplasm as having superior quality.
