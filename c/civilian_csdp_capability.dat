40|$|This brief aims {{to assess}} the {{coherence}} of the training initiatives taken at the EU level {{in the field of}} the civilian dimension of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). The analysis focuses on the training for personnel involved in Civilian Crisis Management (CCM), at both strategic and operational levels. Training for CCM constitutes a significant dimension of the strengthening of EU capabilities in the field of CSDP. It contributes {{to the development of a}} European security culture (Council of the European Union, 2004 : 3) by promoting a common understanding of the <b>civilian</b> <b>CSDP</b> among personnel from the EU institutions and the Member States. Training also improves the quality of CSDP mission personnel, which in turn directly influences the effectiveness with which they fulfil their tasks (Khol, 2008 : 6). Considering the existence of different training initiatives in the field of <b>civilian</b> <b>CSDP</b> at the EU level, it seems relevant to try {{to assess the}}ir coherence. Since it determines the strength of the link between training needs and training activities, the analysis of the training needs assessment phase will constitute the first dimension of the assessment of the coherence EGMONT Royal Institute for International Relations of these initiatives. The range of actions and their impact on the coherence of the overall training framework in <b>civilian</b> <b>CSDP</b> will constitute the second dimension. In order to contextualize this analysis, it should be stated that, firstly, training is only one particular aspect of a broader recruitment issue. It should be put into perspective therefore with other aspects of this problem such as the development of rosters of personnel. Secondly, when focusing on EU initiatives, it should be kept in mind that this analysis will cover only a small aspect of the training activities conducted in <b>civilian</b> <b>CSDP</b> given the fact that Member States provide a significant majority of these training activities...|$|R

Straipsnyje laikomasi prielaidos, kad BSGP civilinėmis misijomis ES kuria pridėtinę vertę, siekdama saugumo, stabilumo ir gerovės pasaulyje. Pagrindinis dėmesys sutelkiamas į šiandieninių BSGP civilinių misijų vietą ES krizių valdymo procese ir minėtų misijų įtakos įgyvendinant Bendrosios užsienio ir saugumo politikos tikslus įvertinimo galimybes.

The paper aims at {{contributing}} to discussion regarding {{the role of}} the civiliai Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) missions. The EU intends to strengthen itself as a provider of international security, although its <b>CSDP</b> related <b>capabilities</b> are under constant criticism. The paper has two tasks: first, to provide information about the place of <b>CSDP</b> <b>civilian</b> missions in EU crisis management efforts, and second, identify the benefits provided by such missions to the goals of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). Presumably, the impact of the missions could be traced following the developments in the host countries assessed by internationally recognisable indexes. The study hints at some reasons why the missions are beneficial throw description of civilian EU crisis management procedures, information concerning the capability development, depiction of existing civilian missions and finally and, the most important, by attempts {{to assess the impact of}} some on-going <b>CSDP</b> <b>civilian</b> missions in particular areas...|$|R

In geopolitical terms, {{it is necessary to}} assess the potential and the current deployment of civilian missions. For this purpose, in accordance with the hypothesis of my work, that the civilian aspects of crisis management CSDP are based mainly on the willingness and desire of Member States in a given area or country involved should be analyzed for the three major priorities of Member States (UK, Germany and France) in civilian areas (see National Security Strategy). The work compares the current activities of EU civil security-CSDP and geopolitical intentions of the three great European powers, Germany, France and Great Britain. <b>Civilian</b> <b>CSDP</b> should concentrate in geographic areas that are of key importance to most member states and especially for three large powers. The question is whether the major European powers reflect their priorities in EU policy in its entirety or whether there are other factors that prevent them from doing so. Such factors include decisions based on consensus and the growing power of the European Commission, which defends its interests very hard in the CSDP. Large Member [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{equality}} {{being considered}} one of the key normative foundations of the EU, gender has not yet been mainstreamed within the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). This article investigates the impact of institutional structures on the inclusion of a gender dimension in this policy area. The article adopts Woodward’s (2003) model of feminist triangles to unpack the role of actors and processes; specifically, highlighting key innovations and missed opportunities to integrate gender into CSDP. Focusing in particular on femocrats, the article argues that for gender mainstreaming to take place, the office of the Gender Advisor needs to bridge the division between the military and <b>civilian</b> dimension of <b>CSDP.</b> It concludes that CSDP remains largely gender blind in spite of the EU’s adoption of an action plan for the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security...|$|R
40|$|After an {{overview}} of the practice concerning <b>civilian</b> and military <b>CSDP</b> operations, this paper argues that international peace and security is a EU normative value, a broad legal principle in particular, in the sense that EU institutions are legally bound to pursue and promote it throughout the world. It is moreover suggested that, as a matter of its internal validity, EU may not launch peace keeping operations, including enforcement actions or peace enforcement operation falling under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, without a Se- curity Council authorization or welcoming. However, the consent of the host State gov- ernment suffices as long as the CSDP operation is purely civilian. Certainly, the EU does not deliver on the promise of universal peace and security. That is due to the inadequacy of the current EU legal framework, which after all reflects a strong political division of prospects and interests among Member States...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} European Union’s (EU) {{security}} {{relationship with the}} North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the United States (US) through {{the framework of the}} Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP). Skeptics have decried the rise of CSDP as a new security pillar, arguing that it is an attempt to balance against NATO and the US. I argue that this criticism is false. A comparison of two CSDP military operations, European Union Force Chad/CAR (EUFOR Tchad/RCA) and European Union Force Althea (EUFOR Althea), shows that operational success is heavily dependent on the EU’s ability to use NATO assets through the Berlin Plus agreement. While EU security integration has progressed, it continues to suffer from a significant capabilities gap; without access to NATO <b>capabilities,</b> <b>CSDP</b> military operations face many challenges. I conclude that CSDP is not threatening the transatlantic relationship because the EU remains a limited hard power actor in promoting and securing international securit...|$|R
40|$|Civilian crisis {{management}} {{has long been}} considered the EU's forte. Recent research however has questioned the EU's claim to this specialization. I will interrogate how the EU has fared in building <b>civilian</b> <b>capabilities</b> for <b>CSDP</b> through {{a case study of}} the impact of the Europeanization of CCM norms in one of the newer EU member states - Poland. I investigate the domestic reverberations of an EU-level CCM governance - conceptualized as a vertical diffusion of norms - and a horizontal diffusion in the realms of policy setting, institutional adaptation, as well as in recruitment and training. I hypothesize that the European cognitive constructions and policy designs are the more likely to impact upon Polish security policy the more they resonate with the ideas embedded in the national security identity. Another intervening variable affecting the 'translation' of EU policy into the domestic context is state capacity. Due to weaknesses in the supply side of CCM and the refracting impact of national security identity and state capacity, I find that Europeanization has had a limited impact on the civilian response capability-building in Poland. Europeanization has been shallow, featuring adjustments on the margins rather than the core of the security policy...|$|R

The contribution of the Republic of Macedonia to the EU operation Althea has confirmed its progress from a consumer of the first EU military operation (Concordia 2003) into an active contributor to the CSDP (Althea 2006).The first contribution of the Republic of Macedonia to an EU-led operation began in July 2006, by declaring a helicopter detachment, consisting of two Mi-8/17 helicopters and 21crew.In November 2006, the Republic of Macedonia enhanced its own contribution to the EU operation Althea in Bosnia and Herzegovina by declaring a medical team composed of 10 personnel for providing Role 1 medical support in Camp Butmir.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. The European Union (EU) currently lacks a comprehensive agreement {{on where the}} EU will engage in crisis management missions under the Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) framework. This thesis investigates the motives for why the European Union engages in military or civilian operations under the framework of CSDP. Predominant research suggests the three dominant factors motivating the EU to engage in CSDP are national interests of the Member States; the EU is a supranational institution seeking to balance against the U. S.; and national political parties dominate foreign policy of the Member States. These three dominant factors {{lead to the development}} of three hypotheses for why the EU engages in military operations under the framework of CSDP. The first hypothesis suggests the EU elects to undertake CSDP missions as a means of balancing against United States' hegemony. The second hypothesis suggests the EU undertakes CSDP missions because of the national interest of the dominant nations, specifically, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The final hypothesis suggests that the national political parties and their political stances influence when the EU will engage in military or <b>civilian</b> operations under <b>CSDP.</b> These hypotheses are tested using three case studies to examine what the dominant factor is in CSDP mission selection. The three cases represent missions outside of Europe where there is significant risk for EU troops and, therefore, significant political risk for EU Member State politicians. The three CSDP missions used in the case study section are the EU mission EUFOR Artemis to Bunia the Democratic Republic of Congo, EUPOL Afghanistan and EUNAVFOR Somalia. After examining the three cases within the boundaries of the three hypotheses, this thesis concludes that the national interests of the dominant Member States are the most significant motive for CSDP mission selection. While the other two motives {{play a role in the}} decision-making process, they are not nearly as dominant as that of the Member States' national interests...|$|R
