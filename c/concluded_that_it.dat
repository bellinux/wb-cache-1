5|$|At the time, many Japanese politicians, {{including}} Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (who was {{an outspoken}} critic of an alliance with Nazi Germany), were shocked by the Anglo-German Naval Agreement.

5|$|Between 21 and 24 November 2011, 23 of the RAAF's F-111C and F-111Gs {{which had}} not been {{selected}} for preservation were buried at the Swanbank landfill site outside of Ipswich, Queensland. The RAAF had considered scrapping these aircraft, but <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be cheaper to bury them. The remaining ex-RAAF F-111s will be placed on display.|$|E

5|$|Coffelt's {{account was}} {{reviewed}} by the FBI, which <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> differed in significant details from information {{that had not been}} made public, and was therefore a fabrication. Brown, undeterred, continued peddling the story long after Coffelt died in 1975. Multiple media venues, including the television news program 60 Minutes, considered and rejected it. In a 2008 book about Lincoln's descendants, author Charles Lachman revisited Coffelt's tale although it had been discredited 36 years before.|$|E
5|$|Corythosaurus was an ornithopod, and {{therefore}} a herbivore. Benson et al. (2012) realized that the beak of Corythosaurus was shallow and delicate, and <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> must {{have been used to}} feed upon soft vegetation. Based on the climate of the Late Cretaceous, they guessed that Corythosaurus would have been a selective feeder, eating only the juiciest fruits and youngest leaves. Corythosaurus specimens have been preserved with its last meal in its chest cavity. Inside the cavity were remains of conifer needles, seeds, twigs, and fruits, meaning that Corythosaurus probably fed on all of these.|$|E

5|$|Opinion has varied on the {{validity}} of a separate genus for Nedoceratops. John Scannella and Jack Horner regarded it as an intermediate growth stage between Triceratops and Torosaurus. Andrew Farke, in his 2011 redescription of the only known skull, <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was an aged individual of its own valid taxon, Nedoceratops hatcheri. Nicholas Longrich and Daniel Fields also did not consider it a transition between Torosaurus and Triceratops, suggesting that the frill holes were pathological.|$|E

5|$|Reports {{into the}} crash by the Greek Air Force, and an {{independent}} investigator hired by Onassis, the Englishman Alan Hunter, <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had occurred {{as a result of}} the reversing of the aileron connecting cables during the installation of a new control column. This cause was disputed by McGregor who believed that the wake turbulence from an Air France Boeing 727 that had taken off before them had caused the crash.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle is}} {{controversial}} because many historians and writers have <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was failures by British divisional and corps commanders that squandered {{an opportunity to}} capture Caen, rather than the Germans achieving a defensive success. To resist the offensive, the Germans had committed their most powerful armoured reserves, which deprived them of the fighting power for a counter-offensive and forfeited the initiative to the Allies.|$|E
5|$|A 2009 {{consensus}} {{from the}} studies of {{the introduction of the}} euro <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> has increased trade within the eurozone by 5% to 10%, although one study suggested an increase of only 3% while another estimated 9 to 14%. However, a meta-analysis of all available studies suggests that the prevalence of positive estimates is caused by publication bias and that the underlying effect may be negligible. Furthermore, studies accounting for time trend reflecting general cohesion policies in Europe that started before, and continue after implementing the common currency find no effect on trade. These results suggest that other policies aimed at European integration might be the source of observed increase in trade.|$|E

5|$|After the election, {{many analysts}} <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was {{the unity of}} the {{opposition}} parties against Congress, missing in the 1962 elections, that made the difference. The victory is attributed to the electoral alliance between DMK and Rajaji. Even though Congress had done an effective job of managing the state of Madras, the effective grass roots campaigning by the DMK and the political acumen of Annadurai, defeated the Congress and its leader M. Bhaktavatsalam. The popularity of the United Front was so large {{that they were able to}} win an absolute majority in ten out of the 14 districts in the state, while Congress could not accomplish that in a single district. This was largely due to the fact that the United Front was able to capitalize on its growing support in large towns and cities, combined with the decline in Congress support in its traditional Schedule Caste constituencies.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1907, U.S. naval and {{military}} planners had <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be impractical to repel {{an invasion of}} the Philippines. The best that could be hoped for was that the garrison could hold out on the Bataan peninsula until help arrived. In the 1920s {{it was estimated that}} they could do so for about 60 days. By the 1930s, the planners had become decidedly pessimistic in view of the increased capability of aircraft, and by 1936 they were agreed that the Philippine should be written off. But in July 1941, this decision was abruptly reversed, and it became the policy of the U.S. government to defend and hold the Philippines. This was based, at least in part, in the belief that Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers could deter or defeat an invading force.|$|E
5|$|As the CIP allowed licensees {{to import}} goods at half price, it was {{regarded}} as a virtual guarantee of business success, regardless of entrepreneurial skill. As a result, the licenses were highly prized. For those who were not confident in their sales ability, a healthy profit was usually made by selling their license to other willing businessmen, especially as demand far outstripped supply. A 1966 US Government report <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was possible to guarantee a 100% domestic profit on piasters, and that a 50% profit could be safely achieved by using black market exchange rates and depositing one's money in an American bank.|$|E

5|$|At {{the road}} bridge, German {{forces of the}} 9th SS had quickly {{surrounded}} Frost's battalion, cutting them {{off from the rest}} of the division. At around 09:00, the 9th SS Reconnaissance Battalion headed back toward Arnhem from south of the river, having <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was not needed at Nijmegen. Though aware of the British troops at the bridge, it attempted to cross by force. In the resultant two-hour battle, it was beaten back with heavy losses; half of its armored vehicles were destroyed or knocked out and its commanding officer, Viktor Gräbner, was killed in action during the assault. German attacks carried on around the British perimeter at the Arnhem bridge for the rest of the day, but the British continued to hold.|$|E
5|$|Botanists in the 20th century {{recognised}} B.oblongifolia as {{a species}} in its own right, but disagreed on the name. Those in Queensland felt Salisbury's name was invalid and used Banksia oblongifolia, while New South Wales authorities used Banksia aspleniifolia {{as it was the}} oldest published name for the species. Botanist and banksia authority Alex George ruled that oblongifolia was the correct name in his 1981 revision of the genus. After reviewing Salisbury's original species description, which is of the leaves alone, he <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> does not diagnose the species to the exclusion of others and is hence not a validly published name—the description could have applied to juvenile leaves of B.paludosa, B.integrifolia or even B.marginata.|$|E
5|$|By late December 1991, {{just over}} a month after victory had been proclaimed in Vukovar, opinion polls found that 64 percent wanted {{to end the war}} {{immediately}} and only 27 percent were willing for it to continue. Milošević and other senior Serbian leaders decided against continuing the fighting, as they saw it as politically impossible to mobilise more conscripts to fight in Croatia. Desertions from the JNA continued as the well-motivated and increasingly well-equipped Croatian Army became more difficult to counter. By the end of 1991, Serbia's political and military leadership <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be counter-productive to continue the war. The looming conflict in Bosnia also required that the military resources tied up in Croatia be freed for future use.|$|E
