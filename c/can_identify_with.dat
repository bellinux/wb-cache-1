Lehms derived from the prescribed gospel, the finding in the Temple, a dialogue. Instead of a parent missing a son, as in the gospel, an allegorical Soul (soprano) misses Jesus (bass). The motifs of the story, the loss and anxious search, are placed in a more general {{situation in which the}} listener <b>can</b> <b>identify</b> <b>with</b> the Soul.

500|$|Such {{educational}} comics {{have been}} criticised for ignoring the special relevance the subject has to the LGBT community, with homosexuality marginalized {{in favour of}} depicting HIV {{as a threat to}} conventional heterosexual relationships. This has been blamed on the continuing perception that comics are for young people, and as such should be [...] "universalised" [...] rather than targeting specific groups, and hence are heteronormative, failing to provide characters that LGBT-identfying young people <b>can</b> <b>identify</b> <b>with.</b> Other educational comic books such as the Swiss Jo (1991) also exclude explicit reference to homosexuality (as well as drug-taking and prostitution), in spite of their target audience being older.|$|E

500|$|The GRC scheme {{has been}} criticized as {{weakening}} the candidate–voter relationship, because {{it may be more}} difficult for voters to feel that candidates actually represent them when {{there are a number of}} candidates in a team to vote for. Most voters elect MPs whom they <b>can</b> <b>identify</b> <b>with</b> and are better able to represent their interests. It would be much easier for voters to identify with a single candidate than with a team of, say, four individuals. Also, since there will be key vote pullers in every GRC, the unknown or unpopular candidate is [...] "dragged into Parliament on the coat-tails of the major vote-puller". This alienates the electorate from its representatives, thereby undermining the idea of representation. Since the people [...] "cannot clearly identify themselves with the candidates ... responsibility for choices cannot be ascribed to the people".|$|E

Between 1989 and 1994, The Newcastle Herald ran at least 39 stories on Leigh, 23 of them featured on the front page. At least ten articles on the case were published in The Sydney Morning Herald during the same period. Both the extended media coverage and the theatrical plays and film the murder inspired have led to it being termed a [...] "celebrity crime", and to Leigh being {{referred to as a}} [...] "celebrity victim". In 1996 Psychologist Roger Peters attributed the media fascination to the sense of community in Stockton, and due to the crimes being committed by people not considered to be typical criminals, [...] stating [...] "I think one of the main things is that people <b>can</b> <b>identify</b> <b>with</b> people involved.

I learned an incredible amount and the team became very close. We are all incredibly proud of the film." [...] Breckin told the Irish Independent the intent was to portray realistic scenes in the film: [...] "We wanted it as realistic as possible in terms of young people having fun.

It had to be that the audience can relate to my character, that they can see how she gets herself in certain situations and how easily that can happen."

500|$|Peggy's {{breast cancer}} storyline was devised at the {{suggestion}} of a scriptwriter in a story conference session and, according to the production staff, was an idea [...] "that had been knocking about for a long time." [...] In Lesley Henderson's book, Social Issues in Television Fiction, an EastEnders researcher explains that: [...] "A lot of illnesses [...] translate quite readily into strong dramatic material", and the experience of being hospitalised or waiting on test results is something everyone <b>can</b> <b>identify</b> <b>with.</b> The programme sought expert advice on [...] "storyline visuals" [...] {{from a variety of sources}} including cancer organisations, breast cancer charities and medical professionals. There were anticipated problems with running a breast cancer story, such as timing, characterisation, casting, and interweaving the plot with other ongoing storylines. A story editor has explained: [...] "EastEnders is perceived as being an issue-led show, but it isn't, it's character and story-led [...] If you haven't got the character to fulfill that storyline then it won't work. You've got to be careful to make sure that the illness actually impacts on the family dynamics and the character development." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Food Wife" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} producer of The Simpsons Matt Selman. The writing process began around September 2010. According to Selman, the episode mainly revolves around Homer and Marge competing about who is perceived as the most fun by Bart and Lisa, a situation that he thinks parents <b>can</b> <b>identify</b> <b>with</b> in real-life. The episode also focuses heavily on foodies and food blogs. Selman {{said in an interview}} with New York magazine's Grub Street publication that the foodie culture is [...] "just a world that I always thought was funny and fascinating. The idea of food as not only something you enjoy eating, but as something that you are so passionate about that you're kind of bragging about it. 'I'm the one who discovered this particular Korean pork-neck soup restaurant,' and you can kind of claim that as yours. The blogging just feeds into that kind of territorial element that I always thought was inherently funny.

[...] He explains that the song expresses how he will still date her regardless of their opinions, and author Ed Morales observes that [...] "It's a calling out of the morality of Latin America. [...] It's just an invitation to turn everything upside-down by embracing the ugly and profane in life and, you know, asking people to go on that journey." [...] "Tango del Pecado" [...] also created controversy due to the repeated chanting of [...] "Súbele el volumen a la música satánica" [...] (turn up the satanic music). [...] Residente asserts that he did not add the line to create a reaction, saying, [...] "I never do something expecting something. I do things because I like them." [...] "El Avión Se Cae" [...] depicts the thoughts of a drunken airplane passenger. In [...] "Pal Norte", Residente discusses the plight of immigrants in the United States. [...] Commenting on the track's lyrical themes, he explained [...] "I had wanted to do that theme because I think it is an important topic. And not just for the immigrants in the United States but all over. It is a song that immigrants <b>can</b> <b>identify</b> <b>with,</b> Dominicans as well as Puerto Ricans.

500|$|In {{an early}} draft of Freddy vs. Jason, {{it was decided}} that one of the villains needed a redeemable factor. Ronald D. Moore, co-writer of the first draft, {{explained}} that Jason was the easiest to make redeemable, because no one had previously ventured into the psychology surrounding the character. Moore saw the character as a [...] "blank slate", and felt he was a character the audience could really root for. Another draft, penned by Mark Protosevich, followed Moore's idea of Jason having a redeemable quality. In the draft, Jason protects a pregnant teenager named Rachel Daniels. Protosevich explained, [...] "It gets into this whole idea of there being two kinds of monsters. Freddy is a figure of actual pure evil and Jason is more like a figure of vengeance who punishes people he feels do not deserve to live. Ultimately, the two of them clash and Jason becomes an honorable monster." [...] Writers Damian Shannon and Mark Swift, who wrote the final draft of the film, disagreed about making Jason a hero, although they drew comparisons between the fact that Freddy was a victimizer and Jason was a victim. They stated, [...] "We did not want to make Jason any less scary. He's still a brutal killer... We never wanted to put them in a situation where Jason is a hero... They're both villains to be equally feared." [...] Brenna O'Brien, co-founder of Fridaythe13thfilms.com, saw the character as having sympathetic qualities. She stated, [...] " [...] was a deformed child who almost drowned and then spent the rest of his childhood growing up alone in the woods. He saw his mother get murdered by a camp counselor in the first Friday the 13th, and so now he exacts his revenge on anyone who returns to Camp Crystal Lake. Teenage fans <b>can</b> <b>identify</b> <b>with</b> that sense of rejection and isolation, which you can't really get from other killers like Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers." ...|$|E
