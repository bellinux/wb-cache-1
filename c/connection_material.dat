For the pegged mortice and tenon connections to perform to their full capacity in the softwood base material, 2 d and d end distances are required for connections with 12 and 18 mm pegs, respectively, where d is the diameter of peg.

This paper reports the investigations into the moisture-induced failures in Flip-Chip-on-Flex interconnections with Anisotropic Conductive Films (ACFs). Both experimental and modeling methods were applied. In the experiments, the contact resistance was used as a quality indicator and was measured continuously during the accelerated tests (autoclave tests). The temperature, relative humidity and the pressure were set at 121 °C, 100 %RH, and 2 atm respectively. The contact resistance of the ACF joints increased during the tests and nearly 25 % of the joints were found to be open after 168 hours’ testing time. Visible conduction gaps between the adhesive and substrate pads were observed. Cracks at the adhesive/flex interface were also found.

This study monitored the microbiota from tooth extraction, over 9 months of full edentulism, up to 1 year after abutment <b>connection.</b> <b>Material</b> and methods: Ten patients with severe periodontitis were recruited. Six months after tooth extraction implants were inserted. Three to 6 months later they were connected to abutments. Plaque samples were collected from the tongue dorsum, saliva and subgingival area (teeth/implants) before extraction up to one year after abutment connection, and analysed via culture, qPCR, and checkerboard technology. Results: A reduction in total amount of aerobic and anaerobic CFU/ml was observed. The concentration of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia (qPCR and checkerboard) in the saliva, and to a lower extend on the tongue dorsum reduced. For Prevotella intermedia changes were negligible and no changes could be detected for Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. The pristine subgingival niches were quickly colonized by key-pathogens. Their final concentration remained low, while detection frequencies remained very high over time.

40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} was {{to test the hypothesis}} of no difference in implant treatment outcome after installation of implants with a scalloped implant-abutment connection compared to a flat implant-abutment <b>connection.</b> <b>Material</b> and Methods: A MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase and Cochrane library search in combination with a hand-search of relevant journals was conducted. No language or year of publication restriction was applied. Results: The search provided 298 titles. Three studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The included studies were characterized by low or moderate risk of bias. Survival of suprastructures has never been compared within the same study. High implant survival rate was reported in all the included studies. Significantly more peri-implant marginal bone loss, higher probing depth score, bleeding score and gingival score was observed around implants with a scalloped implant-abutment connection. There {{were no significant differences between}} the two treatment modalities regarding professional or patient-reported outcome measures. Meta-analysis disclosed a mean difference of peri-implant marginal bone loss of 1. 56 mm (confidence interval: 0. 87 to 2. 25), indicating significant more bone loss around implants with a scalloped implant-abutment connection. Conclusions: A scalloped implant-abutment connection seems to be associated with higher peri-implant marginal bone loss compared to a flat implant-abutment connection. Therefore, the hypothesis of the present systematic review must be rejected. However, further long-term randomized controlled trials assessing implant treatment outcome with the two treatment modalities are needed before definite conclusions can be provided about the beneficial use of implants with a scalloped implant-abutment connection on preservation of the peri-implant marginal bone level...|$|E

40|$|The {{behavior}} of steel-concrete composite beams is {{strongly influenced by}} the type of shear connection between the steel beam and the concrete slab. For accurate analytical predictions, the structural model must account for the interlayer slip between these two components. In numerous engineering applications (e. g., in the fields of structural optimization, structural reliability analysis and finite element model updating), accurate response sensitivity calculations are needed as much as the corresponding response simulation results. This paper focuses on a procedure for response sensitivity analysis of steel-concrete composite structures using displacement-based locking-free frame elements including deformable shear connection with fiber discretization of the cross-section. Realistic cyclic uniaxial constitutive laws are adopted for the steel and concrete materials {{as well as for the}} shear connection. The finite element response sensitivity analysis is performed according to the Direct Differentiation Method (DDM). The concrete and shear <b>connection</b> <b>material</b> models as well as the static condensation procedure at the element level are extended for response sensitivity computations. Two steel-concrete composite structures for which experimental test results are available in the literature are used as realistic testbeds for response and response sensitivity analysis. These benchmark structures consist of a non-symmetric, two-span continuous beam subjected to monotonic loading, and a frame sub-assemblage under cyclic loading. The new analytical derivations for response sensitivity calculations and their computer implementation are validated through Forward Finite Difference (FFD) analysis based on the two benchmark examples considered. Selected sensitivity analysis results are shown for validation purposes and for quantifying the effect and relative importance of the various material parameters in regards to the nonlinear monotonic and cyclic response of the testbed structures...|$|E
40|$|Objectives Narrow-diameter {{implants}} (NDIs) {{are used}} in severely resorbed mandibles. The reduced implant diameter means {{a reduction in the}} total contact surface between the implant and bone. The question arises whether the implant can be sufficiently osseointegrated to withstand loading forces. If not, marginal bone loss can result from overload. The aim of this retrospective study was to compare clinical and radiographic measurements and patient satisfaction of NDIs with those of regular-diameter implants (RDIs) placed in edentulous patients to support an overdenture via either a ball or a locator <b>connection.</b> <b>Material</b> and Methods Retrospectively over a 7 -year period, a total 119 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were selected for this study. The patients received two 3. 3 - or 4. 1 -mm-diameter standard titanium implants in the mandible to support an overdenture. At maintenance examinations after 1 and 3 years, clinical peri-implant and prosthetic conditions, marginal bone (MB) and patient satisfaction were investigated. Results None of the 238 implants were lost during the 3 -year follow-up period. Overall MB loss was statistically higher in the NDI group when compared with the RDI group. At the site level, a greater MB loss was observed at the distal side of both implant types. Implants with a locator showed significantly greater MB loss (0. 38 mm) compared with the implants with a ball attachment (0. 14 mm) over the two-year evaluation period (P = 0. 006). Patient satisfaction significantly favoured the NDI (8. 3) and the locator attachment (8. 6). Conclusions The results suggest that during the first three years after implantation, NDIs were associated with more marginal bone loss compared with RDIs. Regardless of implant diameter, the locator attachment showed more marginal bone loss over time compared with the ball attachment...|$|E

The program as a material that is able to produce a more active and connected architecture. To ask more about the effects than the supports, with the same attitude as in the cinema we asked about the movie and not about the screen. Design the events and the moments. The acts and their relations. The program as a matter that manages the architecture like connector between our actions and ambitions and the world we inhabit. The program to overcome the stable and absorb the worrisome. To overcome the object and integrate the unlikely. Programmatic interdependence's between stable spatial structures linked with the blurred boundaries of human activities. The juxtapositions as a <b>connection</b> <b>material</b> that synchronize the contemporary man dynamics with its existing context. Build stories and moments. Working with the apparent invisibility of uses. With the transparency {{of life and the}} intangibility of relationships. This research intended to stop talking for a moment's space to discuss about the program. Or talk about space from another perspective, from the angle of the actions. Not from any human actions but the actions that occur in the architectural supports. Approaching the spaces through events. The look on the informal program interdependencies evidence sets, by reflecting on the differences between the physical limits of spatial structures and boundaries -much more diffuse and fluid- from human activities. The juxtapositions with their interdependencies, emphasize the value of the effectiveness of the actions of those above formal order configurations, generating appropriate relationships that weave a complex net of truly contemporary urban dynamics. Combinations and programmatic juxtapositions stimulate simultaneously all relational capacity of the project. A relationship that bind to the contemporary world of information constantly overlapping. The malleability of the program optimizes the relationship of human actions with the physical matter of the project. This research aims to ultimately give the program the prestige that belongs as project material. And detecting the potential of incorporating this material, evidencing the ability of this relational and effectiveness of the interaction between events and spaces. Ultimately, to continue supporting the events in a juxtaposition world. Esta investigación fuerza una mirada incluyente sobre el programa arquitectónico y sus combinaciones.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of connections}} in fire has become {{of particular interest}} to the structural engineering community following the possible link of connection failure to the collapse of the World Trade Centre building 7 and the failures and huge distortion of some connections after the Cardington full scale tests. In order to widen the understanding of the complex behaviour of connections in fire this thesis discusses a number of specific issues relating to connections in fire and their influence on structural response. The first part of this work presents a finite element model for predicting connection temperature profiles. A parametric study is then carried out to investigate which factors have the greatest influence on temperature prediction. This method is compared to the currently available methods for connection temperature prediction presented in the Eurocodes: using a percentage of the beam mid-span lower flange temperature to estimate the temperature across the connection and a lumped capacitance method to calculate average joint temperature based on the mass of material and surface area. In each case, along with the predicted temperatures, the influence on <b>connection</b> <b>material</b> strength is also presented. The three methods have varying levels of accuracy. The finite element model provides detailed and accurate results due to the thorough consideration given to the input parameters. The percentages method gives reasonable estimates in the heating phase but is less accurate in cooling and the lumped capacitance method is only suitable for crude estimations. The remainder of the thesis is concerned with how a number of phenomena affect the overall structural behaviour of buildings: the inclusion of detailed connection models within larger, less complex, finite element models; the effects of connection rotational capacity and the composite beam-slab shear connection. A finite element model for isolated joints is presented in detail for a number of heating regimes and connection types. The influence of the bolt shear and tensile properties is considered in detail and the need for further testing on bolts at high temperatures is discussed. The model has the capacity to predict a number of failure modes and also shows a good comparison between experimental and theoretical deflected shapes. This connection model is then inserted into a large model. It is shown that whilst the inclusion of the shell connection has a small influence on the residual deflections of a structure after cooling when compare to a model where connections are simple and fixed, the difference between heating and not heating the connection does effect structural deflections. Following on from the previous full scale model, simple connections are then exclusively included where the connection rotational capacity is varied. Results show {{that there is not a}} large effect on the structural deflections or beam axial and shear forces when rotational behaviour is changed. However column bending moments are hugely increased during heating both in the fire compartment and away from it and fixed connections result in larger bending moment that pinned ones. Finally, the shear interaction between the slab and beams is investigated. The detailed development of both an ambient temperature and then an elevated temperature model of a beam-slab system including explicit shear studs are presented. A study is then carried out looking at the effects on deflections and beam forces when the strength and ductility of the studs are altered. It is found that more ductile studs with a high shear capacity are beneficial for reducing forces in beams and limiting their deflections. Finally the shear studs are included in the larger model used in previous chapters where results are similar to those seen in the beam-slab model, but are less pronounced.
