The aim of this work has been set to elaboratean energy-independent technical solution for protection of heat-exchange equipment against freezing the moisture condensed on the heat-exchange surfaces while using the low-potential heat of ambient air in heat pump systems. The investigations have shown that at the temperatures of ambient air close to 0 °C when using the «traditional» way of defrostation, which means the reverse mode of operation of heat pump, an intensive formation of ice is observed at the bottom part of evaporator (if not provided with tray heater). This effect is provoked by downward flow of thawed water and it’s freezing in the lower part of the heat-exchanger due to the fact that the tray and housing of heat pump have a temperature below zero. Thereafter, while the defrostation mode has been periodically used, the ice coat would be going to continue its growth, and by time significant area of evaporator could appear to be covered with ice. The results of the investigations presented in the article could be applied both to air-source heat pumps and to ventilation air heat recuperators...|$|R

The present study involves the sizing of triple concentric pipes <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> where in two cold water streams flow through the central tube and outer annular space at same mass flow rates and same inlet temperatures in co-current direction while hot water flows through inner annular space in counter-current direction. This paper proposes a basic procedure for calculating overall heat transfer coefficients and length of triple concentric pipes <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> Length of triple pipe <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> is computed for a required temperature drop of hot water with available dimensions of three pipes by LMTD method.

40|$|One of {{the major}} indeterminates in the design as well as {{operation}} of <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> is the rate of fouling a select <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> geometry would exhibit over the operation cycles. Gradual deterioration of <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> performance due to the accumulation of fouling film on the heat transfer surface is often accounted for {{in the form of}} a fouling resistance, or commonly known as the fouling factor, while determining the heat transfer surface required for a specific heat duty.
