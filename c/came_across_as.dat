5|$|In The New York Times, {{journalist}} Michael Massing {{felt that}} the author's view on contemporary free-speech issues (her stance on limiting censorship, and her view that little television programming could cause harm to children) was extreme. The American Prospect criticized the author's presentation style, acknowledging Heins was a skilled attorney {{on the subject of}} civil liberties, but called the book itself boring. The review compared the author's writing style to comic books, and concluded Heins' chronology of litigation regarding profane speech <b>came</b> <b>across</b> <b>as</b> less than a neutral presentation.|$|E
5|$|Umboh was {{an authoritarian}} perfectionist, who often reshot scenes he felt flawed and refused {{input from the}} actors. He {{sometimes}} worked together with other directors, including Sjumandjaja, Misbach Yusa Biran, and Arifin C. Noer, to improve the film's flow. These collaborations influenced {{the atmosphere of the}} films; for example, films shot with Noer like Sesuatu yang Indah (Something Beautiful; 1976) <b>came</b> <b>across</b> <b>as</b> surrealistic, while collaborations with Sjumandjaja were more realistic. Shooting scripts were often prepared minutes before shooting, but, according to Karya, Umboh memorised each line of dialogue and used his recollection during dubbing.|$|E
5|$|Daljit {{manages to}} crawl to the {{recording}} room, where Karan {{is still on}} air. When Karan understands {{that he has been}} shot, they speak amongst themselves for the last time, regarding the others, about Sue and about Daljit's love for her. They are then killed by police commandos while laughing. It is then revealed that McKinley described the third kind of people he <b>came</b> <b>across</b> <b>as</b> being the ones who embraced death as a friend and an equal, with a heartfelt laughter. After their death, the public reacts with outrage and expresses urge to bring Indian politics to justice, following the motives of all the boys.|$|E

5|$|Tiberius, however, {{attempted}} {{to play the}} same role as Augustus: that of the reluctant public servant who wants {{nothing more than to}} serve the state. This ended up throwing the entire affair into confusion, and rather than humble, he <b>came</b> <b>across</b> <b>as</b> derisive; rather than seeming to want to serve the state, he seemed obstructive. He cited his age as a reason why he could not act as Princeps, stated he did not wish the position, and then proceeded to ask for only a section of the state. Tiberius finally relented and accepted the powers voted to him, though according to Tacitus and Suetonius he refused to bear the titles Pater Patriae, Imperator, and Augustus, and declined the most solid emblem of the Princeps, the Civic Crown and laurels.|$|E
5|$|After {{a failed}} {{attempt by the}} defence to {{question}} the court's jurisdiction, several witnesses were questioned {{over a period of}} several weeks, including Udin's neighbours and wife, as well as Sudarmo's nephew. The hearings, which were held on Mondays and Thursdays, were filled with spectators. At the trial, the defence suggested that a government conspiracy may have been responsible, but were told by the tribunal to focus on the case at hand. Further witnesses, including a key witness for the prosecution, <b>came</b> <b>across</b> <b>as</b> unconvincing; they also changed their stories, reneging statements which they had made before the trial. Other witnesses for the prosecution, including several of Sumaji's neighbours, testified that the driver could not have committed the murder because he was at home on the night of 13 August. Another said that the steel pipe said to be the murder weapon in court was different from that found with Udin's blood on it.|$|E
25|$|Their {{recordings}} {{were fairly}} lo-fi. Mick Jones' recording method was hands-off: he allowed the band to perform one song several times through and would then {{choose the best}} take. He performed minimal audio mixing and dubbing. While Bernard Butler was less strict with this, the final sound still <b>came</b> <b>across</b> <b>as</b> raw and unpolished.|$|E

25|$|Garry South, Steve Westly's {{campaign}} manager, stated Angelides' {{attacks on}} Schwarzenegger <b>came</b> <b>across</b> <b>as</b> boastful and partisan to the electorate. The attacks failed to register and perhaps backfired, because Angelides' {{failed to take}} into account Schwarzenegger shift back to the political center, moderating his policies and returning to close co-operation with the Democratic-dominated assembly since his widely unsuccessful 2005 special election.|$|E
25|$|The {{reaction}} from fans {{to the pilot}} is generally mixed. Although praised for its high quality animation, fans simply felt that the pilot for the most part, <b>came</b> <b>across</b> <b>as</b> too campy for a comic (especially {{under the guidance of}} John Byrne and Chris Claremont) with often dark and adult oriented themes like X-Men. The on-screen action sequences had to be severely curtailed for a children's cartoon show, and the episode only superficially deals with the sort of social issues often dealt with in the comics, such as isolation, intolerance, racism and bigotry.|$|E
25|$|In December 2012, {{during the}} tour of Pakistani cricket team in India in 2012â€“13, he <b>came</b> <b>across</b> <b>as</b> a very {{different}} and aggressive batsman and scored so brilliantly and briskely and helped Pakistan to win the first T20I and 2nd ODI with his heroics of brilliant batting and nearly chasing a mountain high target of 191 in the second T20I. His scores were 61 and 55 in first and second T20I respectively and scored 76 runs in the 2nd ODI and sharing an opening stand of 141 with Nasir Jamshed and also bowled brilliantly as always economically to help Pakistan win their first ODI series in India since 7 years. He is now {{considered to be the}} main allrounder of Pakistan Cricket team. He had a great series against Sri Lanka in Dec 2013, where he scored 122 in the first match, 140* in the third and 113* in the fourth match. Thus he became, the second batsman after Zaheer Abbas to score 3 centuries in an ODI series. Hafeez was initially selected in the Pakistan squad for the 2015 World Cup but was ruled out 6 days before the World Cup due to a calf injury. He was replaced by Nasir Jamshed.|$|E

500|$|Douglas-Home {{inherited}} from Macmillan a government widely perceived as in decline, [...] "becalmed {{in a sea}} of satire and scandal", in Hurd's phrase. Douglas-Home was the target of satirists on BBC television and in Private Eye magazine.

500|$|He was a {{supporter}} of Margaret Thatcher. He appeared {{as one of the}} players selected for the new Wembley Stadium's 'Walk of Fame' prior to the venue's first FA Cup final in May 2007. A 256-page biography of his footballing career entitled A Tenner and a Box of Kippers, written by Jonathan Strange, was published in 2006.

500|$|Pfeiffer and Worrall {{considered}} that whilst Brown looks perfect, the role had been softened {{from that of}} Lee; they also considered him [...] "far too avuncular", although in Licence to Kill they remarked that he <b>came</b> <b>across</b> <b>as</b> being very effective as he removed Bond's double-0 licence. Continuation author Raymond Benson agrees, noting that the M role was [...] "once again under written, and Brown is not allowed the opportunity to explore and reveal his character traits"; Benson also considered the character to be [...] "too nice".|$|E
500|$|To better {{utilize the}} character, {{this is one}} of several second-season episodes that focuses on Chakotay. [...] It was written with a mind to recall the action story of Chakotay from [...] [...] Writer Kenneth Biller {{extensively}} rewrote the episode after input from series co-creators Jeri Taylor and Michael Piller; whereas the Kazon originally <b>came</b> <b>across</b> <b>as</b> too much like the Klingons, Biller's research helped emphasize their more street-gang nature. [...] This substantial rewrite of the episode required an overhaul of production work already invested in the episode.|$|E
500|$|All of the in-game objects (including non-player characters) in Virtual Theatre {{occupied}} space, {{which was}} a unique feature for an engine at the time. Consequently, non-player characters had to side-step the player's protagonist and any other object they <b>came</b> <b>across,</b> <b>as</b> well as the player had to side step them. When a non-player character bypassed the protagonist, he or she uttered a comment (like [...] "Excuse me, Sir"). As the result, the engine achieved a more realistic game world than previous engines were able to provide, though non-player characters could unwittingly block a path as the player was traversing the game scene.|$|E

500|$|It allowed in-game {{characters}} to wander around the gameworld independently of each other, performing [...] "everyday life" [...] actions, {{which was not}} previously possible, and all characters and objects occupied space; consequently, non-player characters had to side-step the player's protagonist and any other object they <b>came</b> <b>across,</b> <b>as</b> well as the player having to side-step them, achieving a more realistic game world that previous engines were unable to provide, though non-player characters could unwittingly block a path as the player was traversing the game scene. Non-player characters performed much simpler tasks with each release due to size constraints.|$|E
