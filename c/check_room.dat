Although the men's and women's bath halls both have stained glass windows in aquatic motifs, the most impressive stained glass is the massive skylight in the men's area, with the DeSoto fountain centered on the floor directly below it. The second floor originally had dressing rooms, lockers, cooling rooms, and massage and mechano-therapy departments; now it is largely occupied by wood changing stalls, with entry to a centrally located quarry-tile courtyard for sunbathing. The third floor houses a massive ceramic-tiled Hubbard Currence therapeutic tub (a full body immersion whirlpool installed in 1938 when other hydrotherapeutic pools were also added), areas for men' s and women' s parlors, and a wood panelled gymnasium to the rear. The most impressive space on the third floor is the assembly room (now museum) where the segmentally arched vaults of the ceiling are filled in with arched, stained glass skylights. Arched wood-frame doors surrounded by fanlights and sidelights open out to the small balconies of the front elevation. The basement houses various mechanical equipment, a bowling alley (since removed), and the Fordyce spring - a glazed tile room with an arched ceiling and a plate glass window covering over the natural hot spring (spring number 46).|$|E

"Beautiful New Surf & Sand Club Exemplifies 'The Broadway's' Interior Decorating & Furnishing Facilities, On {{the edge of}} the sea at Hermosa Beach stands this imposing new six-story structure of unusual architectural beauty. It was the pleasure and privilege of The Broadway Department Store to furnish this delightful 'country club by-the-sea. ' Surf and Sand Club combines the facilities, comforts, and informality of a country club with the dormitory and indoor athletic features of fine urban clubs. On the first floor is located a wonderful white-tiled warm salt water swimming pool with blue decorations.

The remaining four upper floors, exclusive of the children's recreation room on the roof, contain 124 bedrooms, many with private porches. The Furniture is of the Spanish Renaissance Period. To harmonize wit hthe rich dark brown oak woodwork of the club, furniture of the Spanish Renaissance period was chosen. Deep upholstering in plain mohair and figured wool tapesty in black, red, yellow and blue designs make an effective and striking contrast. Very New Are The Casement Curtains Of Templar Cloth. Curtainings of Templar cloth in buff color are over-hung by rich orange velour drapes, both being suspended from artistic wrought iron fixtures. Templar cloth is a new, thick, heavy fabric which eliminates the use of window shaded and keeps out the sun's glare. The library shows a slightly different window treatment with Templar cloth curtains and blue striped silk damask hangings. The floor is covered with a soft, deep pile carpeting. The bedrooms have four post walnut beds with incidental pieces to match. The floors are carpeted in black and tan Axminster carpeting. The window outlook is beautified with buff color Templar cloth curtains. When Confronted With a Furnishing or Decorating Problem, Consult Our Corps of Specialists!

The Broadway display workshop was transformed in to a huge sewing room and the drapes were shirred and fashioned just as in the home. More than 1600 yards of sunfast suiting were used, in addition to a large quantitiy of rope and heavy twine. The color scheme - red, yellow, and green - of course conforms in the official regulations of the Shrine Order. The main banner which is hung {{in the center of the}} building is 42 by 58 feet.
