5000|$|Many of the [...] "criteria" [...] {{used by the}} Review Committee are imprecise and {{how they}} might be {{consistently}} applied across all <b>concept</b> <b>papers</b> is unclear. It is not known if {{all members of the}} Review Committee collaborate on scoring each Concept Paper, or if each reviewer scores several papers on his or her own. The latter case could result in increased disparity in the application of the criteria. The answers to most questions appear to simply be taken from the applicant's statements in the Concept Paper being evaluated, with no verification of accuracy. Further, the answers to some criteria seem like they should result in the disqualification of a Concept Paper, rather than just being part of its overall score.|$|E
5000|$|In May 1942, the <b>concept</b> <b>papers</b> for Plough were {{scrutinized}} by Lieutenant Colonel Robert T. Frederick, a young {{officer in}} the Operations Division of the U.S. General Staff. Frederick predicted Plough would be a military fiasco on the following grounds. Firstly, he argued that Plough endeavored to achieve unrealistic objectives {{with the amount of}} troops that the plan called for. Similarly, he argued that the small, elite division would be outnumbered and overtaken in any defensive attempts to hold an area once it was captured. Furthermore, Frederick concluded that there was no concrete way to evacuate the troops after a mission. Finally, the plan had called for troops to be dropped by airplane to their targets, which Frederick said was impossible at the moment, as there were no planes to fly the men into Norway. Ultimately, he concluded that a small squad of elite men would not do enough damage to justify the risk of putting them into battle [...] and instead proposed a series of strategic bombings to achieve the plan's objectives.|$|E
