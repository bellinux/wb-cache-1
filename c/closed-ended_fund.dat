5000|$|A {{closed-end fund}} (CEF) or <b>closed-ended</b> <b>fund</b> is a {{collective}} investment model based on issuing a fixed {{number of shares}} which are not redeemable from the fund. [...] Unlike open-end funds, new shares in a closed-end fund are not created by managers to meet demand from investors. Instead, the shares can be purchased and sold only in the market. This is the original design of the mutual fund which predates open-end mutual funds but offers the same actively managed pooled investments. In the United States, closed-end funds sold publicly must be registered under both the Securities Act of 1933 and the Investment Company Act of 1940.|$|E
40|$|I study {{a natural}} {{experiment}} in the Indian mutual funds sector that created a 22 month period in which closed-ended funds were allowed to charge an arguably shrouded amortized fee whereas open-ended funds were forced to charge standard entry loads. I find that allowing closed-end funds to charge the shrouded type of fee led to a proliferation of closed-end funds in the market; 45 new closed-end funds were started over this 22 month period, whereas only 1 <b>closed-ended</b> <b>fund</b> had ever been started in the 66 months prior to this period, and no closed-ended funds were started in the 23 months after this period. I argue that other theoretical determinants of the closed versus open ended organizational form, as described in Stein (2005), did not change discretely around the natural experiment and thus are unlikely to explain the sudden emergence and disappearance of closed-ended funds in the Indian market. If all the investors in new closed-end funds during this period had invested in the lower fee open fund variety instead they would have paid 4. 25 percent less in fees over this 22 month period, equal to approximately 500 million dollars in extra fees...|$|E

50|$|In the United States, closed-end {{funds are}} {{referred}} to under the law as closed-end companies and they form one of three SEC recognized types of investment companies along with mutual funds and unit investment trusts.

The Territory is also the second largest domicile for formation of offshore investment funds (behind the Cayman Islands) with 2,422 licensed open-ended funds as at 30 June 2012 (there is no official statistics for <b>closed-ended</b> <b>funds</b> which are not regulated in the British Virgin Islands).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a limited sample of non-listed real estate funds {{operating in the}} Nordic countries. Non-listed <b>closed-ended</b> <b>funds</b> are typically associated {{with a lack of}} transparency, limited size and tradability and complicated structures. More and more non-listed <b>closed-ended</b> <b>funds</b> have been launched in Europe and the Nordics for the past ten years. The {{purpose of this study is}} to describe and examine the potential benefits with investing in non-listed funds in relation to other real estate investments. By conducting interviews with fund managers and investors alike, this paper reviews the recent developments of funds, discusses typical fund structures and presents how investors and fund managers consider non-listed funds as opposed to other real estate investments. Our findings suggest that non-listed funds are not suffering from low transparency. Moreover, there are indeed liquidity issues but they are not considered to be of particular concern. The findings also suggest that there has been a homogenization of distribution policies and administration fees. The answer to the specific research question is that institutional investors invest in non-listed funds in order to achieve greater diversification effects as the investment is seen as a complement...|$|R

50|$|As a {{follow up}} to SSSF I, the company {{launched}} Samena Special Situations Fund II, {{which had a}} Final Closing in June 2013 of US$340 million.

50|$|Similarly, {{although}} {{the reference to}} fund {{can be taken to}} include any sort of collective investment, within offshore jurisdictions themselves, the term offshore fund is often limited to purely open-ended investment funds (i.e. a fund where the investor can redeem his investment during the life of the fund) where the investment is by way of equity (rather than by debt). This is often because <b>closed-ended</b> investment <b>funds</b> (where the investor cannot redeem out), and funds where the investment is structured by way of debt, are not normally subject to the usual regulatory requirements for investments funds, and so are not treated as funds in the stricter sense of that word.|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this doctoral thesis is {{to contribute to the}} fields of Finance and Information Management by focusing on an integrated risk and return management for investment projects in the Digital Economy. After introducing the transformation toward digitized value networks, an integrated risk and return management cycle that meets the requirements of value based management is presented, and challenges regarding its application in the valuation of investment projects are discussed. More precisely, these challenges concern specific aspects of identification, quantification, and reporting of risk and return, which are addressed in the research papers of this doctoral thesis. Regarding identification, the research papers analyze and classify the multitude of operational risks in digitized manufacturing. At this, the research papers conclude that the identification of threats, affected protection goals, and possible cascading effects in digitized value networks requires uniform understanding and comprehensive collaboration between companies and disciplines. Regarding quantification, the research papers focus on applying the principles of value-based management to investment projects in energy efficient IT in order to contribute to project planning and decision making. Both research papers disclose decision errors when disregarding the effects of fluctuating energy prices in the investment valuation. Regarding reporting, the research paper focuses on reporting standards for <b>closed-ended</b> alternative investment <b>funds</b> (<b>closed-ended</b> AIFs) that enable transparency and comparability for private investors. The advantages of the proposed valuation system are demonstrated by using a data sample of real closed-ended AIFs and by comparing the valuation system to the existing information provision. This discloses an existing lack of transparency regarding the justification of forecasts. The doctoral thesis concludes with a summary and an outlook on future research...|$|R
