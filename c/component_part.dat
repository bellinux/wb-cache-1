50|$|Composition {{is a kind}} of {{association}} where the composite object has sole responsibility for the disposition of the <b>component</b> <b>parts.</b> The relationship between the composite and the component is a strong “has a” relationship, as the composite object takes ownership of the component.

If the composite object is destroyed, all the <b>component</b> <b>parts</b> must be destroyed. The part has no life of itself and cannot be transferred to another object. Composition enforces encapsulation as the <b>component</b> <b>parts</b> usually are members of the composite object.|$|R

25|$|Early in the 15th {{century the}} ideas of Humanism in Croatia brought about changes {{to the world of}} music. Interest in music began to spread outside of monastic and church walls with growing {{influence}} of new spiritual tendencies from Central European and particularly Italian cities. Humanists and philosophers promulgated new musical theories and aesthetic ideas: Federik Grisogono, Pavao Skalić, Frane Petrić. The writing down of folk and popular music began in mid-sixteenth century: in the poem Fishing and Fishermen’s Talk from 1558, Petar Hektorović ingrained Neoplatonic ideals in popular music; and transcripts of Croatian musical folklore were printed in Venetian anthologies (Giulio Cesare Barbetta 1569, Marco Facoli 1588). Julije Skjavetić from Šibenik published his madrigals (Li madrigali a quattro, et a cinque voci 1562), while his Motetti a cinque et a sei voci, (1564) are characterised by a lavish polyphonic structure {{under the influence of the}} Dutch school. Music and dance were a <b>component</b> <b>part</b> of theatrical expression (Mavro Vetranović, Nikola Nalješković, Marin Držić, Marin Benetović), while the function of music and sound effects was under the influence of Italian pastorals.|$|E
25|$|For instance, theft {{is defined}} in section 378 of the Code, and section 379 makes simple theft (or theft simpliciter) an offence {{punishable}} with imprisonment of {{up to three years}} or with fine or both. Section 379A punishes the theft of a motor vehicle or any <b>component</b> <b>part</b> of a motor vehicle with imprisonment of not less than one year and not more than seven years and a fine. Sections 380 and 381 respectively make it offences to commit theft in any building, tent or vessel which is used as a human dwelling or for the custody of property; and, while being a clerk or servant, or being employed in the capacity of a clerk or servant, to commit theft of any property in the possession of one's master or employer. In both cases the penalty is imprisonment of up to seven years and a fine. The most serious theft offence is that of committing theft, having made preparation for causing death or hurt or restraint, or fear of death or of hurt or of restraint, to any person in order to commit the theft, or in order to effect an escape after committing the theft, or in order to retain property taken by the theft. The maximum penalty is imprisonment for up to ten years and caning with not less than three strokes.|$|E

In addition the sixth graders also go on day trips, while the seventh grade class goes to Bear Canyon for a week. The 8th grade class takes a weeklong retreat to Manzano mountain or Hummingbird Music Camp and the 9th grade class takes another 4 day, 3 night, [...] backpacking trip to various areas throughout the state although sometimes just inside the borders of Arizona or Colorado. As a conclusion to the theme of group camping trips, the entire senior class also ventures to Manzano mountain retreat over the first weekend of school for additional bonding among the members of the grades, who have often been together for 7 years at the school. The campus also houses a low ropes course, and a higher 60ft(18m) tower, with a harness swing attached, called the Alpine Tower.

2500|$|Harry Haywood's book, Negro Liberation, {{published}} {{first in}} 1948, {{was the first}} major study of the African-American national question written by an African-American Marxist. According to Haywood in his autobiography, Paul Robeson subsidized his work on the project by offering $100 a month. It was translated and published in Russian, Polish, German, Czech and Hungarian. It was reprinted in 1976 by Liberator Press, the publishing arm of the October League. According to Haywood, [...] "The position of the book was not new, but a reaffirmation of the revolutionary position developed at the Sixth Comintern Congress in 1928. The heart of this position is that the problem is fundamentally a question of an oppressed nation with full rights of self-determination. It emphasized the revolutionary essence of the struggle for Black equality arising {{from the fact that the}} special oppression of Blacks is a main prop of the system of imperialist domination over the entire working class and the masses of exploited American people. Therefore the struggle for Black liberation is a <b>component</b> <b>part</b> of the struggle for proletarian revolution. It is the historic task of the working-class movement, as it advances on the road to socialism, to solve the problem of land and freedom of the Black masses." [...] On the other hand, Haywood went on to write, [...] "What was new in the book was the thorough analysis of the concrete conditions of Black people in the post-war period. I made extensive use of population data; the 1940 census, the 1947 Plantation Count and other sources, in order to show that the present day conditions affirmed the essential correctness of the position we had formulated years before." [...] Because of this and other works, Robert F. Williams called Harry Haywood [...] "one of the modern pioneers in the Black liberation struggle." ...|$|E

In the program evaluation process qualitative data analyses methods are used.

Overall results from the program evaluation should be considered as positive.
