5|$|Fares on Community Transit buses {{are priced}} into three groups: adult, youth, and reduced. Adult fare is charged for {{passengers}} {{between the ages}} of 19 and 64, youth fare is charged for passengers between ages 6 & 18, and the reduced fare is charged for passengers over the age of 65 or those with disabilities or Medicare card holders. Up to two children under 5 ride free with a chaperone paying full or reduced fare for themselves. Fares also change based on service level, with local service within Snohomish County costing the least and <b>commuter</b> <b>service</b> to Seattle being more expensive; <b>commuter</b> <b>service</b> from southern Snohomish County and Everett is also less costly compared to <b>commuter</b> <b>service</b> from northern and eastern Snohomish County. The last fare increase occurred on July 1, 2015, raising the adult and DART fares by 25 cents.|$|E

5|$|The {{company also}} joined {{the joint venture}} <b>Commuter</b> <b>Service</b> along with other Norwegian {{regional}} airlines, Coast Aero Center, Mørefly and Trønderfly. The intention {{was to create a}} cooperative company which could compete in a more diversified market. The group's lawyer stated that the organizational structure among regional airlines was 15 years out of date and that the group would take market shares in a growing market, especially by starting new niche direct services.|$|E
5|$|The {{report also}} called for three {{commuter}} rail modernizations. The New Haven Railroad <b>commuter</b> <b>service</b> would get 144 EMUs, as well as signal improvements, high-level platforms, and renovated cars. The Penn Central Railroad would get 130 EMUs, high-level platforms, and electrified trackage north to the Brewster station. The Erie Lackawanna Railroad in New York State would get new equipment, and a study would be conducted {{to determine whether the}} ELRR could go to Pennsylvania Station. All of these improvements were to extend into Phase II of the project.|$|E
5|$|Yawkey is a {{commuter}} rail {{station on the}} MBTA Commuter Rail Framingham/Worcester Line, located in the Fenway-Kenmore neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts near Kenmore Square. The station sits below grade between Beacon Street and Brookline Avenue, next to the Massachusetts Turnpike. Yawkey station was originally opened as an infill station in 1988, for limited service to Boston Red Sox games at Fenway Park. Regular <b>commuter</b> <b>service</b> began in 2001 for riders headed to Boston University, Kenmore Square, and the Longwood Medical and Academic Area.|$|E

5|$|As rail {{service and}} {{industry}} declined, Ayer made an awkward {{transition from a}} rail-centered town to a car-centered town. Both depots were demolished around 1960; the former northern depot and surrounding land was sold to a local business owner on September 29, 1960. The provisions of the sale and later transactions included deed restrictions requiring the purchaser to provide an easement for public station access {{as well as a}} station facility for 100 years. Service along the Fitchburg main line was cut back to Fitchburg that same year, leaving Fitchburg Line <b>commuter</b> <b>service</b> between Fitchburg and Boston as the sole remaining passenger service through Ayer when the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) was created in 1964 to subsidize suburban commuter services.|$|E
5|$|In early 2000, the MBTA {{released}} a study which analyzed {{the possibility of}} full-time <b>commuter</b> <b>service</b> to Yawkey to serve workers at nearby Boston University, Kenmore Square, and the Longwood Medical and Academic Area. An addendum released in August 2000 analyzed increased service (on all modes) to Fenway Park on game days. Possibilities studied included running game day service from the Plymouth/Kingston Line with an unused trainset, a South Station-Yawkey shuttle, increased Green Line service, and bus shuttles to the Red Line in Cambridge and to Ruggles station. Consideration was given to building a dedicated terminal spur and station on {{the remains of the}} former Highland Branch.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} rest of the Hudson Line, the Scarborough station became a Penn Central station once the New York Central and Pennsylvania Railroads merged in 1968. Penn Central's {{continuous}} financial despair throughout the 1970s forced them to turn over their <b>commuter</b> <b>service</b> to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The station and the railroad were turned over to Conrail in 1976, and eventually became part of the MTA's Metro-North Railroad in 1983. In 2007, the MTA overhauled the station, installing new systems such as platforms, canopies, shelters, enclosed staircases, lighting, and benches. The station's overpass was demolished and a replacement was built with elevators on either side. The new overpass was designed in a less modern style and now has glass-sided elevators. During the construction, Metro-North built a temporary wooden station to the station's south.|$|E

5|$|Teaneck {{is split}} {{east and west}} by {{railroad}} tracks, which currently provide freight service by CSX Transportation. Until 1959, passenger train service was provided on these same tracks by the West Shore Railroad, with Teaneck stations at Cedar Lane and West Englewood Avenue. <b>Commuter</b> <b>service</b> was available from these stations, with 44 passenger trains operating daily to and from Weehawken, where Hudson River ferry service was available to New York City at 42nd Street and at the Financial District in Lower Manhattan. Train service from Teaneck was also available north to Albany, along the west shore of the river. Efforts are ongoing to restore some passenger train service on this line for commuters heading toward New York City, including extension of the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail service via the Northern Branch to Englewood or Tenafly.|$|E
5|$|The station {{continued}} receiving major service {{over the}} next five decades, but by 1966, fewer trains stopped at the station, with limited daily service to the station past the 4:33 p.m. train from Hoboken Terminal. Six years later, on June 24, 1972, the Erie–Lackawanna Railroad, who now maintained the station, announced further cutbacks on station service, axing twenty-three train stops at Roseville Avenue for both directions of service. The changes were made as part of major <b>commuter</b> <b>service</b> appropriations and the lack of patronage at the station. From that point, Roseville Avenue went from 37 westbound trains to 14, while eastbound was cut from 37 to 16. Service on Saturdays were cut to flag stops only, while the station received no Sunday service at all. On April 1, 1976, the Erie–Lackawanna Railroad became defunct, and merged into Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail), with service sponsored by the New Jersey Department of Transportation.|$|E
5|$|B {{service was}} also cut due to {{financial}} {{problems in the}} late 1930s and again after World War II; by 1950, Pittsfield was served by eight Boston-Albany round trips per day. The four daily trips to North Adams ended in 1953. The opening of the Massachusetts Turnpike in 1957 and the Berkshire Thruway two years later provided {{for the first time}} an auto route to western Massachusetts superior to the narrow and winding Route 20; this effectively decimated long distance service on the B In January 1960 the NYC received permission to discontinue all B service that April, but public outcry prevented full cancellation. On April 24, 1960, stops west of Framingham except Worcester, Palmer, Springfield, and Pittsfield were closed; Boston-Albany service via Pittsfield was reduced to just 3.5 daily round trips. Still facing losses, the B was finally fully absorbed into the NYC in 1961, effectively subsidized by its popular New York <b>commuter</b> <b>service.</b> The crack New England States, introduced in 1938, was combined with the 20th Century Limited west of Buffalo on November 5, 1967. After the latter was discontinued on December 2, the New England States lost its named distinction on December 3.|$|E

5|$|The Santa Fe {{introduced}} the El Capitan in 1938. The train {{ran on the}} Santa Fe's main line between Chicago and Los Angeles. Unusually for streamliners of the period, the El Capitan carried coaches only, and had no sleeping cars. Passengers flocked to the new train, and the Santa Fe added cars to meet the demand. The train grew from five cars in 1938 to fourteen in 1952. Sometimes demand was high enough to justify running a second instance ("section") of the train on the same day. The Santa Fe sought a solution to increase {{the capacity of the}} train without lengthening it further. Two popular innovations by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB) suggested a solution. First, in 1945, the CB {{introduced the}} first dome car, in which passengers rode on a second level high above the tracks, affording better views. Second, in 1950, it placed bilevel rail cars in <b>commuter</b> <b>service</b> in the Chicago area. Taken together, these innovations suggested a new possibility: a long-distance bilevel coach, with greater capacity than single-level cars, and the panoramic views of a dome.|$|E
5|$|There {{are over}} two dozen public transit {{agencies}} in the Bay Area with overlapping service areas that utilize different modes, with designated connection points between the various operators. Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), a heavy rail/metro system, operates in four counties and connects San Francisco and Oakland via an underwater tube. Other commuter rail systems link San Francisco with the Peninsula and San Jose (Caltrain), San Jose with the Tri-Valley Area and San Joaquin county (ACE), and Sonoma with Marin county (SMART). In addition, Amtrak provides frequent <b>commuter</b> <b>service</b> between and San Jose and the East Bay with Sacramento, and long distance service {{to other parts of}} the United States. Muni Metro operates a hybrid streetcar/subway system within the city of San Francisco, and VTA operates a light rail system in Santa Clara county. These rail systems are supplemented by numerous bus agencies and transbay ferries such as Golden Gate Ferry and the San Francisco Bay Water Transit Authority. Most of these agencies accept the Clipper Card, a reloadable contactless smart card, as a universal electronic payment system.|$|E
