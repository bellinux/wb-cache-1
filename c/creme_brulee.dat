Other desserts on the menu include a hollow sphere of chocolate, which a hot chocolate sauce is poured over to dissolve the sphere in order to unveil the ball of milk ice cream within, and a fennel <b>crème</b> <b>brûlée</b> served with Alphonso mango. The wine list starts from around £25, and moves up to a 1961 magnum of Pétrus at £39,000.|$|E

25|$|White wine is also {{a dessert}} wine. All choices are allowed even if the sweet and {{fortified}} wines {{are more suitable for}} this. Perfumed wines (Gewurztraminer, Muscat), sparkling, and sweet wines accord well with fruit desserts (salad, tart). The fortified and sparkling wines support rich desserts made with cream or butter. <b>Crèmes</b> <b>brûlées</b> or caramel which combine sugar and cream can be eaten with a sweet and lively wine such as Jurançon or a late harvest wine. Chocolate requires a very powerful wine so white wine selection is quite limited: a natural amber sweet wine is the best compromise.|$|R
50|$|For the {{signature}} challenge, the bakers {{had to make}} twelve <b>crème</b> <b>brûlées.</b> They had {{two and a half}} hours, with the brief being given that they custard must be set, and that the bakers weren't allowed to use a blowtorch to caramelise the top. For the technical challenge, the bakers had four hours to make a Spanische Windtorte. This dessert had two types of meringue, Swiss and French, designed into a circular box and filled with cream and fruit. Three tiers of cheesecakes was set as the showstopper. The structure must be self-standing, and must have unique flavours.|$|R
25|$|A meal often {{consists}} of three courses, hors d'œuvre or entrée (introductory course, sometimes soup), plat principal (main course), fromage (cheese course) and/or dessert, sometimes with a salad offered before the cheese or dessert. Hors d'œuvres include terrine de saumon au basilic, lobster bisque, foie gras, French onion soup or a croque monsieur. The plat principal could include a pot au feu or steak frites. The dessert could be mille-feuille pastry, a macaron, an éclair, <b>crème</b> <b>brûlée,</b> mousse au chocolat, crêpes, or Café liégeois.|$|E
25|$|Sucralose is {{a highly}} {{heat-stable}} noncaloric sweetener, allowing it {{to be used in}} many recipes with little or no sugar. It is available in a granulated form that allows for same-volume substitution with sugar. This mix of granulated sucralose includes fillers, all of which rapidly dissolve in liquids. While the granulated sucralose provides apparent volume-for-volume sweetness, the texture in baked products may be noticeably different. Sucralose is not hygroscopic, which can lead to baked goods that are noticeably drier and manifest a less dense texture than those made with sucrose. Unlike sucrose, which melts when baked at high temperatures, sucralose maintains its granular structure when subjected to dry, high heat (e.g., in a 350°F or 180°C oven). Furthermore, in its pure state, sucralose begins to decompose at 119°C or 246°F. Thus, in some baking recipes, such as <b>crème</b> <b>brûlée,</b> which require sugar sprinkled on top to partially or fully melt and crystallize, substituting sucralose will not result in the same surface texture, crispness, or crystalline structure.|$|E
500|$|Najika {{falls in}} love with Sora, after he tells her that he is her flan prince. However, he soon dies after being struck by a truck while on a journey to deliver some {{ingredients}} to Najika, and, in his final moments, admits that he lied about being her flan prince, having fallen in love with her. She loses her sense of taste out of sorrow, although she quickly recovers it. After Sora's death, Daichi is unable to bring himself to act on his love for her, though he gives in to his father's demands to protect Najika from being kicked out of the school and becomes the student body president to replace Sora. Wealthy and conceited junior pastry chef [...] also begins to attend the school, where he clashes with Najika, whom he had watched bake as a young girl at the orphanage. Seiya eventually {{falls in love}} with her, and tries to romantically pursue her, although he gives up when he realizes that she loves Daichi. After Daichi recovers a repressed memory of his mother's death during a family trip to Hokkaidō—which Sora attempted to protect him from by lying about being Najika's flan prince—he remembers that he is actually her flan prince, having given her a flan made by Seiya, and accepts her feelings for him. Joyful, she fulfills her promise to him by making him a <b>crème</b> <b>brûlée.</b>|$|E

500|$|Lavigne {{released}} her first fragrance, Black Star, created by Procter & Gamble Prestige Products. The fragrance was announced on Lavigne's official website on 7 March 2009. Black Star, which features notes of pink hibiscus, black plum and dark chocolate, {{was released in}} summer 2009 in Europe, {{and later in the}} US and Canada. When asked what the name meant, Lavigne replied, [...] "I wanted [...] to be a star, and my colors are pink and black, and Black Star resembles being different, and standing out in the crowd, and reaching for the stars; the whole message is just about following your dreams, and it's okay to be unique and be who you are." [...] Black Star won the 2010 Best [...] "Women's Scent Mass" [...] by Cosmetic Executive Women (CEW). Black Star was followed by a second fragrance in July 2010, Forbidden Rose, which took two years to develop. It features notes of red apple, winepeach, black pepper, lotusflower, heliotrope, shellflower, praline agreement, sandalwood, and vanilla. Its message is an extension of Black Star's [...] "follow your dreams", though the tagline for the new perfume is [...] "Dare to Discover". The commercial takes place in a gothic garden setting, where Lavigne, upon entering the garden, finds a single, purple rose. Lavigne launched a third fragrance, Wild Rose, in August 2011 and filmed the commercial for it in late 2010. The tagline for the fragrance is [...] "Dare to discover more". It features notes of mandarin, pink grapefruit, plum, orange blossom, frangipani, blue orchid, musk, sandalwood and <b>crème</b> <b>brûlée.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{surface was}} {{initially}} {{reported to be}} a clay-like [...] "material which might have a thin crust followed by a region of relative uniform consistency." [...] One ESA scientist compared the texture and colour of Titan's surface to a <b>crème</b> <b>brûlée</b> (that is, a hard surface covering a sticky mud like subsurface). Subsequent {{analysis of the data}} suggests that surface consistency readings were likely caused by Huygens pushing a large pebble into the ground as it landed, and that the surface is better described as a [...] "sand" [...] made of ice grains or snow that has been frozen on top. The images taken after the probe's landing show a flat plain covered in pebbles. The pebbles, which may be made of hydrocarbon-coated water ice, are somewhat rounded, which may indicate the action of fluids on them. The rocks appear to be rounded, size-selected and size-layered as though located in the bed of a stream within a dark lakebed, which consists of finer-grained material. No pebbles larger than 15 centimeters across were spotted, while rocks smaller than 5cm are rare on the Huygens landing site. This implies large pebbles cannot be transported to the lakebed, while small rocks are quickly removed from the surface.|$|E
