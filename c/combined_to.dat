Except akasha, all other tanmatras have attributes of the previous ones in the succeeding ones. The tanmatras are quanta of energy. The total sattwik aspects of the five tanmatras <b>combine</b> <b>to</b> form the antah-karana or inner-instrument consisting of manas, buddhi, citta and ahamkara; the individual sattwik aspects of tanmatras <b>combine</b> <b>to</b> produce the jnana-indriyas consisting of the five sense organs of perception.

5|$|Although Lincoln {{won only}} a {{plurality}} of the popular vote, his victory {{in the electoral college}} was decisive: Lincoln had 180 and his opponents added together had only 123.

5|$|As the {{campaign}} progressed, Weaver's message of racial inclusion drew violent protests in the South, as the Greenbackers faced the same obstacles the Republicans {{did in the}} face of increasing black disenfranchisement.

5|$|By early afternoon, the {{low-pressure}} {{area had}} moved east into Nebraska, while the warm front had moved northward into southern Minnesota. The atmosphere {{to the south}} of the warm front was strongly capped, meaning that the best chance of thunderstorm development was in areas along and slightly north of the front. By the time the thunderstorms started developing, CAPE values were 2000J/kg, indicating moderate atmospheric instability. Also present were low-level and deep-layer wind shear values of , respectively. All of these factors <b>combined</b> <b>to</b> create very favorable conditions for the development of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes.|$|E

5|$|Despite these atrocities, {{the main}} cause of the {{population}} decline was disease.
