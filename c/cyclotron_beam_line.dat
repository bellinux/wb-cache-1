40|$|A {{current sensor}} module was {{designed}} and fabricated to measure the beam profile of the cyclotron MC 50 at KIRAMS. The sensors were made of a tungsten wire and they were assembled into an array type. The sensor wires were placed in parallel with the incident beam, while they {{were placed in the}} perpendicular direction to the incident beam in the conventional method. The current output of each sensor was amplified using a trans-resistance amplifier. The front-end stage of this amplifier was implemented using discrete circuit elements and can measure input current in the range of 1 pA to 1 μA. The amplifier had a resolution of ~ 20 fA and the temperature drift of ~ 0. 5 pA/°C. Various test results of the amplifier and sensor module assembly are given in this paper.

Our cyclotron is again served by 2 different injectors a 6 MV Van de Graaff and a 2 MV tandetron. The tandetron was optimized especially for the requirements of therapy. Its advantages are easier handling, lower service requirements and a shorter injection beam line. Development of the source resulted in safe operation of more than 600 h and extremely stable beam current. The tandetron is in operation for therapy since 2011.

40|$|In this investigation, bromine- 77 was {{produced}} with a medical cyclotron and imaged with gamma cameras. Br- 77 emits a 240 kev photon {{with a half}} life of 56 hours. The C-Br bond is stronger than the C-I bond and bromine is not collected in the thyroid. Bromine {{can be used to}} label many organic molecules by methods analogous to radioiodination. The only North American source of Br- 77 in the 702 ̆ 7 s and 802 ̆ 7 s was Los Alamos National Laboratory, but it discontinued production in 1989. In this method, a p, 3 n reaction on Br- 77 produces Kr- 77 which decays with a 1. 2 hour half life to Br- 77. A cyclotron generated 40 MeV proton beam is incident on a nearly saturated NaBr or LiBr solution contained in a copper or titanium target. A cooling chamber through which helium gas is flowed separates the solution from the <b>cyclotron</b> <b>beam</b> <b>line.</b> Helium gas is also flowed through the solution to extract Kr- 77 gas. The mixture flows through a nitrogen trap where Kr- 77 freezes and is allowed to decay to Br- 77. Eight production runs were performed, three with a copper target and five with a titanium target with yields of 40, 104, 180, 679, 1080, 685, 762 and 118 uCi respectively. Gamma ray spectroscopy has shown the product to be very pure, however corrosion has been a major obstacle, causing the premature retirement of the copper target. Phantom and in-vivo rat nuclear images, and an autoradiograph in a rat are presented. The quality of the nuclear scans is reasonable and the autoradiograph reveals high isotope uptake in the renal parenchyma, a more moderate but uniform uptake in pulmonary and hepatic tissue, and low soft tissue uptake.

Specifics of IsoDAR operations at the KamLAND site are not addressed. Recent developments in planning for deployment of IsoDAR include the identification of a potential new site for the experiment, where the target can be placed directly on the equatorial plane of the KamLAND detector, and also, an upgrade of the detector resolution to 3 %/√(E(MeV)). The option of the new site might allow, depending on the results of shielding and background evaluations in KamLAND, for an increase in event rate by about a factor of 1. 6 owing to increased solid angle for the detector, improving the physics reach for a same period of the experiment. Alternatively, it raises the option of reducing technical risk and cost by reducing beam intensity to maintain the originally planned event rates. This new siting option is described, and aspects the physics reach of the sterile neutrino search are updated to reflect this second option, as well as the higher resolution of the experiment.
