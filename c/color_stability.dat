40|$|A new {{nonlinear}} dimensionality reduction {{method for}} multi-spectral images {{was presented to}} solve the problem brought by high dimensionality of multi-spectral images during color reproduction. Firstly, according to the characteristics of human visual system, the CIE standard observer color matching functions were weighted to the source spectral reflectance and then a principal component analysis (PCA) method was used to the weighted spectrum. This effectively improved the colorimetric precision and <b>color</b> difference <b>stability</b> of dimensionality reduction. Then for the spectral reflectance loss caused by weighting color matching functions, a PCA method was imposed on the lost spectrum to compensate the lost spectral accuracy caused by the improvement of colorimetric precision. This effectively improved the spectral precision of dimensionality reduction. Finally the principal components obtained from the first two steps were combined to form the low-dimensional spectral data. Experiments show that the new method outperforms the existing methods in the colorimetric accuracy, spectral accuracy and <b>color</b> difference <b>stability</b> under different illuminant. </p...|$|R

The useful life of many (but not all) pigment formulations has been projected out to be several centuries and beyond (perhaps millennia, if cave paintings of Lascaux, the wall paintings in the tombs of the Valley of the Kings and the frescoes of Pompeii are relevant examples), often being limited only to the useful life of the particular support used.

50|$|There {{are several}} types of multi-color white LEDs: di-, tri-, and tetrachromatic white LEDs.

For example, the dichromatic white LEDs have the best luminous efficacy (120 lm/W), but the lowest color rendering capability. However, although tetrachromatic white LEDs have excellent color rendering capability, they often have poor luminous efficacy. Trichromatic white LEDs are in between, having both good luminous efficacy (>70 lm/W) and fair color rendering capability.|$|E
40|$|Beer {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{extensively}} consumed beverages world-wide and it is almost always brewed with hops (Humulus lupulus, L.). Hops provide beer with bitterness, aroma, flavor and texture and also enhance specific beer properties such as foam stability, clarity (colloidal <b>stability),</b> <b>color,</b> flavor <b>stability</b> and microbial stability. Hops are a dioecious species, with female plants producing the hop strobilus (cone). The cone is an inflorescence, which is the entire part of the plant that holds the flowers. Hop cones contain lupulin glands (the source of the hop bittering resins), essential oils, and polyphenols (prenylflavonoids). Beer prenylflavonoids such as the flavan- 3 -ols and their condensed products, the proanthocyanidins, represent a class of readily oxidizable compounds capable of hindering or preventing the oxidation of other molecules present in beer. Flavan- 3 -ols and proanthocyanidins have recently gained significant consideration as potential beer flavor modifiers and/or stabilizers. However their roles in beer flavor stability have not yet been fully realized. In this study polyphenols were extracted from spent hop (Humulus lupulus L. c...|$|R

More specifically, chemical changes were studied with attenuated total reflectance/Fourier transform infrared analysis, the thermal response was recorded by differential scanning calorimetry experiments, and the thermal stability was detected with thermogravimetric analysis. Also, the rheological properties of these blends,were investigated via melt flow index tests as a measure of their processability during melt mixing and molding processes. Furthermore, the mechanical strength of the obtained mixtures was explored, and the observed interactions were interpreted in terms of the influence of each component on the functional properties of the final mixture.

While existing Kodachrome materials from before Kodak simplified the development process in 1938 are almost always faded, images on Kodachrome slides and motion picture films made after this point retain accurate color and density to this day.

50|$|Quinaldine red is {{also used}} as an {{indicator}} in experiments. In an assay for inorganic and organic phosphates, QR {{proved to be a}} better indicator due to a low blank and its <b>color</b> <b>stability.</b> When being used as an indicator, a color change is involved in order to indicate a change in the pH. For example, in a solution containing inorganic phosphate and ammonium molybdate in sulfuric acid, a reaction could occur where the two substances react forming a phosphomolybdate complex ion, or no reaction could occur. In this case, if pale pink mixture of quinaldine red turns to a colorless solution, this indicates the presence of a free phosphate. If the solution turns a dark red, that indicates the phosphomolybdate complex ion has formed. By using QR as an indicator in this manner, enzymatic activities can be monitored.|$|E
50|$|Multi-color LEDs offer {{not merely}} another means to form white light {{but a new}} means to form light of {{different}} colors. Most perceivable colors can be formed by mixing different amounts of three primary colors. This allows precise dynamic color control. As more effort is devoted to investigating this method, multi-color LEDs should have profound influence on the fundamental method that we use to produce and control light color. However, before this type of LED {{can play a role}} on the market, several technical problems must be solved. These include that this type of LED's emission power decays exponentially with rising temperature,resulting in a substantial change in <b>color</b> <b>stability.</b> Such problems inhibit and may preclude industrial use. Thus, many new package designs aimed at solving this problem have been proposed and their results are now being reproduced by researchers and scientists. However multi-colour LEDs without phosphors can never provide good quality lighting because each LED is a narrow band source (see graph). LEDs without phosphor while a poorer solution for general lighting are the best solution for displays, either backlight of LCD, or direct LED based pixels.|$|E
