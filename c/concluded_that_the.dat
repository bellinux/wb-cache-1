5|$|The Rivers Agency <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{flooding}} was {{an extreme}} event, caused by weather {{that resulted in}} widespread flooding across Northern Ireland. The amount {{of water in the}} rivers exceeded the capacity of the flood defences and the natural river banks. They further <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> flooding was a result of overflow of the Shimna River into the Burren River catchment area through Islands Park, rather than from the Burren River itself.|$|E

5|$|A {{lawrencium}} atom has 103 electrons, {{of which}} three {{can act as}} valence electrons. In 1970, {{it was predicted that}} the ground-state electron configuration of lawrencium was 5f146d17s2 (ground state term symbol 2D3/2), following the Aufbau principle and conforming to the 4f145d16s2 configuration of lawrencium's lighter homolog lutetium. However, the next year, calculations were published that questioned this prediction, instead expecting an anomalous 5f147s27p1 configuration. Though early calculations gave conflicting results, more recent studies and calculations confirm the s2p suggestion. 1974 relativistic calculations <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> energy difference between the two configurations was small and that it was uncertain which was the ground state. Later 1995 calculations <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> s2p configuration should be energetically favored, because the spherical s and p1/2 orbitals are nearest to the atomic nucleus and thus move quickly enough that their relativistic mass increases significantly.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{the pilot}} in command, {{according}} to the cockpit voice recorder transcript, the first officer was the pilot flying {{at the time of}} the accident.

5|$|CENIPA <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ExcelAire pilots {{also contributed}} to the {{accident}} with, among others, their failure to recognize that their transponder was inadvertently switched off, thereby disabling the collision avoidance system on both aircraft, as well as their overall insufficient training and preparation.|$|E
