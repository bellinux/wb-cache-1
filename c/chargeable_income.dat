5000|$|Many systems {{provide for}} {{specific}} exclusions from taxable (<b>chargeable)</b> <b>income.</b> For example, several countries, notably Cyprus, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Spain, have enacted holding company regimes that exclude from income dividends from certain foreign subsidiaries of corporations. These systems generally impose tax on {{other sorts of}} income, such as interest or royalties, from the same subsidiaries. They also typically have requirements for portion and time of ownership {{in order to qualify}} for exclusion. The Netherlands offers a [...] "participation exemption" [...] for dividends from subsidiaries of Netherlands companies. Dividends from all Dutch subsidiaries automatically qualify. For other dividends to qualify, the Dutch shareholder or affiliates must own at least 5% and the subsidiary must be subject to a certain level of income tax locally.|$|E

There is no doubt about this; the lawyer himself has looked at the will. Of course, Mr. Blanchard had his son and his son's widow in his eye when he made the provision. But, as it is not limited to any one heir by name, and not revoked anywhere, it now holds as good with young Armadale as it would have held under other circumstances with Mr. Blanchard's son.

40|$|Part 6 (a) What Personal Assessment {{is and how}} it {{may work}} to reduce your tax {{liability}} z z The Inland Revenue Ordinance provides for the levying of three separate direct taxes for a year of assessment, namely Property Tax, Salaries Tax and Profits Tax. Individuals ordinarily residing in Hong Kong {{may be able to}} reduce their tax liability by electing Personal Assessment. Under Personal Assessment, <b>income</b> <b>chargeable</b> to Property Tax, Salaries Tax and Profits Tax is aggregated and from this total, the followings may be deducted: － business losses incurred in the year of assessment, － losses brought forward from previous years under Personal Assessment, － approved charitable donations, － interest payments on money borrowed for the purpose of producing property income, and － personal allowances and concessionary deductions. z Tax at marginal rates (the same as those used for Salaries Tax) will then be imposed on the balance. Credit will be given for any tax already paid on the income included in the assessment. If the total of the tax already paid exceeds the tax chargeable under Personal Assessment, a refund will be made...|$|R
