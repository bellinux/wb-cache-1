Nevertheless, the LF scheme and the schemes devised based on it, for example, the first-order <b>centered</b> (<b>FORCE)</b> and the slope-limited centered (SLIC) schemes, cannot achieve a time-step-independence solution due to the excessive numerical diffusion at a small time step. In this work, two time-step-convergence improved schemes, the C-FORCE and C-SLIC schemes, are proposed to resolve this problem. The performance of the proposed schemes is validated in solving the one-layer and two-layer shallow-water equations, verifying their capabilities in attaining time-step-independence solutions and showing robustness of them in resolving discontinuities with high-resolution...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a high-order numerical method for the 3 D simulation of viscous and inviscid multiphase flow described by a homogeneous equilibrium model and a general equation of state. Here we focus on single-phase, two-phase (gas-liquid or gas-solid) and three-phase (gas-liquid-solid) flow of CO 2 whose thermodynamic properties are calculated using the Span-Wagner reference equation of state. The governing equations are spatially discretized on a uniform Cartesian grid using the finite-volume method with a fifth-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme and the robust first-order <b>centered</b> (<b>FORCE)</b> flux. The solution is integrated in time using a third-order strong-stability-preserving Runge-Kutta method. We demonstrate close to fifth-order convergence for advection-diffusion and for smooth single- and two-phase flows. Quantitative agreement with experimental data is obtained for a direct numerical simulation of an air jet flowing from a rectangular nozzle.

40|$|AbstractModeling flow discontinuities, {{due to a}} {{numerical}} approach, often pose severe challenges. In this way, a number of techniques like artificial viscosity (particularly for finite difference methods), shock fitting and etc. have been proposed. These techniques usually require ad-hoc terms which need to be adjusted through calibration. In this study, an efficient numerical model based on a shallow water equation is developed. The model uses a first-order <b>centered</b> (<b>FORCE)</b> scheme, {{in combination with the}} Surface Gradient Method, (SGM) for spatial discretization, and the third order Rungeâ€“Kutta algorithm for time integration. At first, it is demonstrated that the model is well-balanced, then, through several classical examples, such as a 1 D dam-break on both dry and wet beds, transcritical flow over a bump, with and without shock, sub-critical flow over a bump, circular dam-break, small perturbation propagation, dam-break on a dry bed channel with varying widths and right-angled channel junctions, it is shown that the model is capable of capturing flow discontinuities. Furthermore, the model can simulate dry bed conditions, and also presents smooth symmetric results...|$|E

40|$|Key to the {{transport}} phase of {{carbon capture and storage}} (CCS) is understanding {{the behavior of}} liquid or supercritical CO 2 in pipelines, and the consequences of cracks and pipe depressurization. It is therefore useful to develop mathematical models and numerical methods for two-phase flow of CO 2 in pipes in order to better predict such behavior. Such developed tools can also be useful in fluid structure- interaction models. Key to simulating single or multiphase flows is the formulation of a flow model. Here, the homogeneous equilibrium model (HEM) has been used. Further, for a flow model such as HEM, closure conditions are needed, and in this thesis the Span- Wagner equation of state (EOS) has been used. This EOS is a Helmholtz function fitted to experimental data for CO 2 properties, and so it is CO 2 -specific. When using the finite volume method to simulate fluid flow, a numerical flux func- tion is needed. In this thesis, the advection upstream splitting method (AUSM) family of schemes has been investigated and compared to the first ordered <b>centered</b> (<b>FORCE)</b> scheme in order to evaluate the performance of AUSM-schemes. AUSM+ up has been found to perform satisfactorily for three test cases. Due to the upstream nature of the scheme, it proved more accurate than the FORCE and Lax-Friedrichs schemes for a test case simulating the advection of a CO 2 gas fraction in liquid. When compared to the results obtained by SINTEF Energy Research for a shock tube case and a depressurization case, AUSM+ up was found to reproduce all the expected solution features seen for the FORCE solution. For the shock tube case, slight differences in the evaluation of energy, temperature and velocity could be seen. Possible reasons for this could be that the solution is not grid-independent or that the flux splitting nature of AUSM schemes simply causes these variables to be evaluated slightly differently, possibly more accurately, compared to FORCE. When simulating the shock tube and the depressurization cases, the thermodynamic solver had problems evaluating the speed of sound correctly. This did not seem to affect the solution of state variables to a large degree. These problems occurred in regions where the thermodynamic solver evaluated certain cells to be liquid phase, whereas other cells were liquid with a fractional amount of gas. Such problems were not seen for FORCE and this is a drawback for AUSM+ up. A further drawback for AUSM+ up is that it requires parameter tuning, and the solution of the shock tube test case was parameter sensitive in order to obtain the correct solution. Another finding when comparing AUSM+ up and FORCE for the depressurization case was that the former has higher computational times for equal grid sizes. This increased computational cost is however well paid off by its better resolution compared with the FORCE scheme. The implementation of AUSM schemes proved complicated due to the need for parameter tuning, but the scheme performed satisfactorily for all test cases. The implementation of FORCE was comparably straightforward. Thus it could be worth investigating AUSM schemes that do not require parameter-tuning. Future work could also include implementing other flow models where one would avoid regions of oscillating speed of sound. Optimization of the AUSM+ up code is also a possible future task...|$|E

Anti-aircraft fire was once again extremely intense, but this time Air Group 18 made it through the day without the loss of a single pilot. The groups strikes were reported likely to have sunk a light carrier and to have damaged both a carrier and a second light carrier. Northern Force was a diversion, however: <b>Center</b> <b>Force</b> had turned around and reentered San Bernardino Strait, heading for the American beachheads at Leyte. After reports filtered in alerting Admiral William Halsey Jr. to the danger posed by the remainder of <b>Center</b> <b>Force,</b> he ordered TG 38.2 to head south at full speed to reengage. The task group arrived hours too late to catch the Japanese battleships, which had once more fled in the face of the U.S. fleet. Though Admiral Kurita devastated the escort carrier unit [...] "Taffy 3" [...] (taskforce) on the 25th, through fierce combat the much smaller, thinly armored Taffys had managed to hold off and even force the withdrawal of his warships.

40|$|The precise {{positioning}} of the mitotic spindle to the cell center during mitosis is a fundamental process for chromosome segregation and the division plane definition. Despite its importance, the mechanism for spindle centering remains elusive. To study this mechanism, the dynamic of the microtubules was characterized at the bulk and at the cortex in the C. elegans embryo. Then, this dynamic was correlated to the <b>centering</b> <b>forces</b> of the spindle that were studied by applying calibrated magnetic forces via super-paramagnetic beads inserted into the cytoplasm of one- and two-cell C. elegans embryos. Finally, these results were confronted with the different centering models: cortical pushing model, cortical pulling model and the cytoplasmic pulling model. This thesis shows that: (i) The microtubules dynamic of the spindle aster is controlled spatially in the C. elegans embryo, with not rescues and catastrophes in the cytoplasm but in the centrosome and the cortex, respectively. (ii) The centering mechanism of the spindle behaved roughly as a damped spring with a spring constant of 18 12 pN/ m and a drag coefficient of 127 65 pN s/ m (mean SD). This viscoelastic behavior is evidence of a <b>centering</b> <b>force</b> that recovers and/or maintains {{the position of the}} spindle in the cell center. (iii) It seems to be two mechanisms that recover/maintain the spindle position. A fast one that may work for transient displacements of the spindle and a slow one that work over large and long perturbations. (iv) The <b>centering</b> <b>forces</b> scale with the cell size. The <b>centering</b> <b>forces</b> are higher in the two-cell embryo. This result argues against a centering mechanism mediated by cytoplasmic factors. It seems to be a limit for the relation of <b>centering</b> <b>force</b> to size, as the forces found in the four-cell embryo are comparable to the single-cell ones. (v) The <b>centering</b> <b>forces</b> scale with the amount of microtubules in the cell. This strengthens the belief that the microtubules are the force transmission entities of the centering mechanism. (vi) The boundary conditions are important to maintain the <b>centering</b> <b>forces.</b> A transient residency time of microtubules at the cortex, which is controlled by cortical catastrophe factors, is indispensable for a proper force transmission by the microtubules. (vii) The elimination of cortical catastrophe factors provides evidence for microtubules buckling, which is taken as a proof of polymerization forces. (viii) The cortical pulling forces mediated by the gpr- 1 / 2 pathway {{do not seem to be}} involved in centering and it is proposed they are present in the cell for off-center positioning purposes. (ix) The forces generated by vesicle transport are enough to displace the spindle and they are suggested to be auxiliary <b>forces</b> to <b>centering.</b> (x) The <b>forces</b> associated with the spindle change dramatically during cell division. From metaphase to anaphase the forces associated with the spindle scale up to five times. This behavior was consistent during the development of the embryo as the same pattern was observed in the one-, two- and four-cell embryo. (xi) The higher forces found during anaphase are not cortical pulling (via pgr- 1 / 2 pathway) depended, and it is proposed the spindle is `immobilised' by tethering or by an unknown cortical pulling pathway. To this date, this thesis presents the most complete in-vivo measurements of the <b>centering</b> <b>forces</b> in association with the microtubules dynamics. Taken together the results constrain molecular models of centering. This thesis concludes that most probably the predominant forces of the spindle centering mechanism during mitosis are generated by astral microtubules pushing against the cortex. Additionally, this thesis presents the most complete map of forces during cell division during development, which will prove to be indispensable to understand the changes the spindle undergoes when it changes its function...|$|R
