Repair <b>of</b> <b>clear</b> <b>defects</b> on ELTV reticles (i. e., regions on the mask which are reflective and should be non-reflective) requires the deposition of {{a thin layer of}} absorbing material.

However, the repair <b>of</b> opaque <b>defects</b> (i. e., the recovery of reflectivity from regions on the reticle covered with an absorber) is more difficult.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} method to detect {{conductor}} defects {{in the field of}} modern non-destructive testing technology. A self-magnetic field induced by flowing current in the conductor is used in the detection technique, and a three-dimensional micro-displacement stage platform is used to scan the sample surface to obtain the self-magnetic field mapping of the whole sample. The subsequent data processing and imaging technology of the detection signal is also developed. To achieve precise positioning of the triaxial directions, an STM 32 microcontroller (MCU) is used as the central processor to design the displacement control system, which communicates with a PC computer through the MCU system. The experimental results demonstrate that the stepper motor driving the magnetic sensor could run uniformly and that the proposed system has the advantages of smooth motion, low noise and high precision.

Mutations in the XPD helicase component of TFIIH can result in the diverse clinical features associated with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and trichothiodystrophy (TTD).

However, to date, there has been no <b>clear</b> demonstration <b>of</b> a <b>defect</b> in expression <b>of</b> any specific gene in individuals with these syndromes.

Eleven TTD patients with characterized mutations in the XPD gene have the haematological features of beta-thalassaemia trait, and reduced levels of beta-globin synthesis and beta-globin mRNA. All these parameters were normal in three patients with XP. These findings provide the first evidence for reduced expression of a specific gene in TTD.

Here, we report the clinical, biochemical and molecular findings in 17 patients who all had isolated COX deficiency and expressed the defect in cultured skin fibroblasts. Immunoblot analysis of mitochondrial fractions with nine subunit specific monoclonal antibodies revealed that in most patients, including in a patient with a novel mutation in the SURF 1 gene, steady-state levels of all investigated COX subunits were decreased. Distinct subunit expression patterns were found, however, in different patients. The severity <b>of</b> the enzymatic <b>defect</b> matched the decrease in immunoreactive material in these patients, suggesting that the remnant enzyme activity reflects the amount of remaining holo-enzyme.
