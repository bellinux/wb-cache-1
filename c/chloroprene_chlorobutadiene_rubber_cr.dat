40|$|Spontaneous {{initiation}} in {{emulsion polymerization}} {{may be more}} important: than in the corresponding bulk free-radical polymerization. A methodology is derived for finding the locus of spontaneous polymerization in emulsion polymerization, through use of spin traps and catalysts which can accelerate decomposition of peroxides. Applying this to both styrene and <b>chloroprene</b> (<b>chlorobutadiene),</b> {{it is found that}} this generation occurs to some degree within all phases present. The rate of spontaneous initiation is relatively small in styrene emulsion polymerization but large in chloroprene. A means of including this effect in modeling rates and molecular weight distributions is derived, which also shows how rate parameters for the process may be obtained from experimental molecular weight distributions. This methodology is applied to these two monomers, with a series of seeded emulsion polymerizations using polystyrene host seeds for both. For styrene polymerization, the spontaneous initiation rate is low and varies with latex preparation; consistent values for this rate coefficient for a given latex are obtained by independent measurements involving two different techniques, thereby verifying the methodology. Applying this methodology to chloroprene, it is found that the effect of spontaneous initiation is much larger and probably arises from peroxides formed by exposure to oxygen. For chloroprene, spontaneous radical generation occurs both within the particles and in any monomer droplets present, with different chain-stopping mechanisms occurring in these two phases. It is a major influence on rates and molecular weight distributions, even in the presence of large amounts of added initiator; chain stoppage in droplets is largely by transfer to monomer, whereas chain stoppage within particles is by termination with short radicals formed by spontaneous initiation. Arrhenius parameters for the rate coefficient for transfer to monomer are obtained from the molecular weight distributions for the chloroprene system: k(tr) /dm(3) mol(- 1) s(- 1) = 10 (4. 3) exp(- 30. 9 kJ mol(- 1) /RT) ...|$|R

The CR nanocomposites containing SNCC exhibit superior curing, mechanical and thermal properties in comparison to NCC-filled CR nanocomposites. The fantastic enrichment in the resulting properties of CR nanocomposites containing SNCC is mainly due to better rubber–filler interaction resulting from the reasonably excellent dispersion of SNCC within the CR matrix. The more uniform distribution of SNCC in comparison to NCC within the rubber matrix is also confirmed from morphological analysis.

The performance of some design codes was evaluated in predicting the cracking moment and crack widths of the tested beams.

The measurements obtained on the samples cut from accelerated specimens are compared to those obtained from the topcoat of an offshore flowline aged under service conditions for 23 years. For both kinds of specimens, polychloroprene develops rapid material changes most clearly represented by a considerable increase in stiffness, which allows the accelerated ageing protocols to be validated...|$|R

A viable solution to this problem is to recycle crumb <b>rubber</b> (<b>CR)</b> —a granulated material derived from scrap tires—and use it to develop other valuable products. Herein we report the fabrication and characterization of CR-modified coatings with anticorrosive properties on metal substrates. By varying the particle size and concentration of CR, we have determined the coating composition that offers the highest level of erosion protection. Images from a scanning electron microscope (SEM) reveal that CR is homogenously dispersed in the coating, especially when fine particles are used. As the concentration of CR increases, the hardness of the coating decreases as a result of the elastic properties of CR. More importantly, the erosion rate of the coating decreases due to increased ductility. Following Potentiodynamic tests, the utilization of these coatings proved to be beneficial as they showed good protection against aqueous corrosion when tested in 0. 5 M NaCl solution.

Results indicate that air voids increase with the increasing of F-T cycles. ITS and ITSM all decrease with the increasing of F-T cycles. The addition of diatomite and SBS can reduce the air void and improve the ITS and ITSM of CRSMA. CRSSMA presents the lowest air void, highest tensile strength, and largest stiffness modulus, which reveals that CRSSMA has the best F-T resistance among three different kinds of mixtures.
