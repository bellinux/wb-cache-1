5|$|C-terminal truncation: The C-terminal end {{segment is}} the most conserved region of TnI. As an {{allosteric}} structure regulated by Ca2+ in the troponin complex, it binds and stabilizes the position of tropomyosin in low Ca2+ state implicating {{a role in the}} inhibition of actomyosin ATPase. A deletion of the C-terminal 19 amino acids was found during myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in Langendorff perfused rat hearts. It was also seen in myocardial stunning in <b>coronary</b> <b>bypass</b> patients. Over-expression of the C-terminal truncated cardiac TnI (cTnI1-192) in transgenic mouse heart resulted in a phenotype of myocardial stunning with systolic and diastolic dysfunctions. Replacement of intact cTnI with cTnT1-192 in myofibrils and cardiomyocytes did not affect maximal tension development but decreased the rates of force redevelopment and relaxation.|$|E

MethodsFrom the United States Renal Data System database, 13, 085 patients on dialysis having first <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> surgery between 2001 and 2006 were identified. Of these, 2335 (17. 8 %) had off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> surgery. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival of patients having off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> and patients having on-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass.</b> A Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess effects of off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> on mortality with adjustment for baseline patient characteristics. ResultsOff-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> surgery was associated with significantly reduced all-cause mortality compared with on-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> surgery (hazard ratio 0. 92, 95 % confidence interval 0. 86 – 0. 99, P = . 02). The observed survival benefit was most notable in the first year after surgery (70. 3 % vs 68. 7 %) and was lost 2 years after surgery (55. 4 % vs 55. 2 %). No difference was noted in the in-hospital mortality rate with off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> surgery versus on-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> surgery (9. 7 % vs 11. 0 %, P =. 06).

40|$|AbstractObjective: Retrospective {{comparisons}} of selected patients undergoing off-pump versus conventional on-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting have yielded inconsistent results and {{raised concerns about}} completeness of revascularization in off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting. Methods: Two hundred unselected patients referred for elective primary <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting {{were randomly assigned to}} undergo off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting with an Octopus tissue stabilizer (Medtronic, Inc, Minneapolis, Minn) or conventional <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass by a single surgeon. Revascularization intent determined before random assignment was compared with the revascularization performed. All management followed strict, unbiased, criteria-driven protocols. Patients and nonoperative care providers were blinded to surgical group. Results: Baseline characteristics were similar. The number of grafts performed per patient (mean ± SD 3. 39 ± 1. 04 for off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting, 3. 40 ± 1. 08 for conventional <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting) and the index of completeness of revascularization (number of grafts performed/number of grafts intended, 1. 00 ± 0. 18 for off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting, 1. 01 ± 0. 09 for conventional <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting) were similar. Likewise, the index of completeness of revascularization was similar between groups for the lateral wall. Combined hospital and 30 -day mortalities and stroke rates were similar. Postoperative myocardial serum enzyme measures were significantly lower after off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting, suggesting less myocardial injury. Adjusted postoperative thromboelastogram indices, fibrinogen, international normalized ratio, and platelet levels all showed significantly less coagulopathy after off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting. Patients undergoing off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting received fewer units of blood, were more likely to avoid transfusion altogether, and had a higher hematocrit at discharge. Cardiopulmonary bypass was an independent predictor of transfusion (odds ratio 2. 42, P =. 0073) by multivariate analysis. More patients undergoing off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting were extubated in the operating room and within 4 hours. Postoperative length of stay (in days) was shorter for off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting (5. 1 ± 6. 5 for off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting, 6. 1 ± 8. 2 for conventional <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting, P =. 005 by Wilcoxon test). One patient (in the conventional <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting group) required angioplasty for graft closure within 30 days. Conclusions: When compared with conventional <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting with cardiopulmonary <b>bypass,</b> off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting achieved similar completeness of revascularization, similar in-hospital and 30 -day outcomes, shorter length of stay, reduced transfusion requirement, and less myocardial injury.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundCoronary artery bypass is an {{acceptable}} therapy {{in patients with}} ischemic cardiomyopathy. However, it has been demonstrated that patients with increased left ventricular volume have a worse outcome than patients with normal ventricular volume. Our hypothesis was that ventricular restoration plus <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> provides improved outcome compared with <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> alone in ischemic cardiomyopathy with ventricular enlargement. MethodsA retrospective analysis was performed of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction < 30 %) who underwent operation between 1998 and 2002. Patients with enlarged ventricles (end-diastolic dimension ≥ 6. 0 cm) who underwent either <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> alone or <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> with ventricular restoration were compared. Preoperative and postoperative ejection fraction, morbidity, mortality, and freedom from heart failure (hospitalization secondary to heart failure) were assessed. ResultsNinety-five patients {{were included in the}} study. Thirty-nine patients had <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> alone, whereas 56 patients had ventricular restoration with <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass.</b> Both groups demonstrated an improved postoperative ejection fraction; however, the improvement was significantly greater in the ventricular restoration plus <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> group (P <. 01). There were no hospital deaths in either group; however, late mortality was higher in the <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> group. Freedom from heart failure was achieved in all but 2 of the ventricular restoration plus <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> patients (2 / 56, or 3. 6 %) versus 7 in the <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> group (7 / 39, or 18 %). The combined outcomes of freedom from failure and late mortality were significantly improved in the ventricular restoration plus <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> group (P <. 05). ConclusionsVentricular restoration affords significant improvement in ejection fraction compared with <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> alone, without added mortality. Most importantly, left ventricular restoration reduces late morbidity and mortality compared with <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> alone in patients with large ventricles...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveThe optimal timing for <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> {{grafting}} after acute {{myocardial infarction}} is not well established. The California Discharge Database facilitates the study of this issue by providing data from a large patient cohort free of institutional bias. We examine the timing of <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting after {{acute myocardial infarction}} on short-term outcomes. MethodsWe reviewed California Discharge Data to identify 40, 159 patients who were hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction (day 0) and underwent subsequent <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting. Patients were stratified by the timing of <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting to “early” (days 0 – 2) and “late” groups (day 3 or later). The primary outcome variable was all-cause hospital mortality. Multiple logistic and linear regression and propensity analyses assessed the risk of adverse events, controlling for factors associated with preoperative clinical acuity, including the Charlson Comorbidity Index, shock, mechanical ventilation, {{and the use of}} intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation. ResultsOf 9476 patients identified, 4676 (49 %) were in the early <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting group and 4800 (51 %) were in the late <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting group. A total of 444 patients (4. 7 %) died during hospitalization, with a peak mortality rate of 8. 2 % among patients undergoing <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting on day 0, declining to a nadir of 3. 0 % among patients undergoing <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting on day 3. The mean time to <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting was 3. 2 days. Patients undergoing early <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting experienced a higher mortality rate than those undergoing late <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting (5. 6 % vs 3. 8 %, P <. 001). Early <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting was an independent predictor of mortality after controlling for clinical acuity and on propensity analysis (odds ratio 1. 43, P =. 003). ConclusionPatients undergoing <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting within 2 days of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction experienced higher mortality rates than those undergoing <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting 3 or more days after acute myocardial infarction, independently of clinical acuity. This suggests that <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting may best be deferred for 3 or more days after admission for acute myocardial infarction in nonurgent cases...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundPatients who undergo {{emergent}} <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting pose {{a greater}} challenge {{in terms of}} intraoperative and postoperative mortality and morbidity compared to elective <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass.</b> <b>Coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> without cardiopulmonary <b>bypass</b> (off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass)</b> might benefit these high-risk patients by eliminating the cardiopulmonary bypass and therefore decreasing the systemic inflammatory response associated with it. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the early clinical outcome after nonelective off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> with a matched set of patients undergoing <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> with cardiopulmonary bypass (on pump). MethodsBetween January 2000 and October 2003, 2273 patients underwent nonelective (urgent or emergent) off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> and were compared with a contemporaneous control group of 3487 patients undergoing on-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass.</b> Logistic regression analysis was used to compare operative mortality, postoperative stroke, length of stay, postoperative placement of intra-aortic balloon pump, postoperative renal failure, and hemorrhage-related re-exploration between the groups, controlling for preoperative risk factors. The patients undergoing off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> were matched to patients undergoing on-pump bypass by propensity scores. ResultsPatients undergoing off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> had comparable operative mortality (odds ratio, 0. 8; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 57 - 1. 15; P =. 24) and stroke rate (odds ratio, 0. 6; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 33 - 1. 08; P =. 09) with the patients undergoing on-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> after controlling for preoperative risk factors through matching. Off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> was associated with an abbreviated length of stay (odds ratio, 0. 5; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 47 - 0. 64; P <. 01), lower rate of postoperative renal failure (odds ratio, 0. 5; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 37 - 0. 72; P <. 01), intra-aortic balloon pump placement (odds ratio, 0. 5; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 3 - 0. 71; P <. 01), and hemorrhage-related re-exploration rate (odds ratio, 0. 70; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 5 - 1. 0; P =. 5) compared with on-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> after matching by propensity scores. ConclusionsNonelective coronary revascularization without cardiopulmonary bypass is associated with comparable operative mortality and stroke and abbreviated length of stay.

40|$|ObjectiveThe aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the influence of off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting on early and long-term mortality and morbidity in a consecutive series of elderly patients (aged > 65 years) compared with conventional <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting. MethodsFrom January of 1999 to December of 2003, data were extracted for 1191 patients aged more than 65 years: a conventional <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting group (n = 744) and an off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting group (n = 447). Age-related early outcomes of interest were in-hospital mortality and postoperative morbidities. Long-term outcomes, including total mortality, repeated revascularization, Q-wave myocardial infarction, stroke, readmission, and the combination of death, Q-wave myocardial infarction, stroke, and repeated revascularization, were evaluated with Cox regression analysis. ResultsUnivariate analysis for early outcomes showed significant benefits from off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting. After adjustment for baseline characteristics, there was still a benefit of off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting. Kaplan–Meier survival analyses (propensity matched cases) showed that stroke, major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, and readmission occurred more frequently in the off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting group (P <. 001). There was a nonsignificant trend to higher total mortality (P =. 193) and higher repeated revascularization rates (P =. 067) in the off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting group. Cox regression for long-term outcomes showed that patients in the off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting group had a higher incidence of stroke (hazard ratio 2. 611, 95 % confidence interval 2. 152 – 3. 070), readmission (hazard ratio 2. 000, 95 % confidence interval 1. 747 – 2. 253), and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (hazard ratio 1. 764, 95 % confidence interval 1. 456 – 2. 072).

40|$|ObjectiveOff-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> {{grafting}} reduces postoperative {{morbidity and}} uses fewer resources than conventional surgical intervention with cardiopulmonary bypass. However, only 15 % to 20 % of <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting operations use off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass.</b> One {{reason for not}} using off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> might be the surgeon's concern about the long-term patency of grafts performed with this technique. Therefore our objective was to compare long-term outcomes in patients randomized to off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> or <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass. MethodsParticipants in 2 randomized trials comparing off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> and <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass were followed up for 6 to 8 years after surgical intervention to assess graft patency, major adverse cardiac-related events, and health-related quality of life. Patency was assessed by using multidetector computed tomographic coronary angiographic analysis with a 16 -slice scanner. Two blinded observers classified proximal, body, and distal segments of each graft as occluded or not. Major adverse cardiac-related events and health-related quality of life were obtained from questionnaires given to participants and family practitioners. ResultsPatency was studied in 199 and health-related quality of life was studied in 299 of 349 survivors. There {{was no evidence of}} attrition bias. The likelihood of graft occlusion was no different between off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> (10. 6 %) and <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass (11. 0 %) groups (odds ratio, 1. 00; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 55 – 1. 81; P >. 99). Graft occlusion was more likely at the distal than the proximal anastomosis (odds ratio, 1. 11; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 02 – 1. 20). There were also no differences between the off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> and <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass groups in the hazard of death (hazard ratio, 1. 24; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 72 – 2. 15) or major adverse cardiac-related events or death (hazard ratio, 0. 84; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 58 – 1. 24), or mean health-related quality of life across a range of domains and instruments.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveAtheromatous aortic {{disease is}} {{a risk factor for}} {{excessive}} mortality and stroke in patients undergoing <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting. Outcomes of off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting and <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass in patients with severe atheromatous aortic disease were compared by propensity case-match methods. MethodsRoutine intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography identified 985 patients undergoing isolated <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting with severe atheromatous disease in the aortic arch or ascending aorta. Off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting was performed in 281 patients (28. 5 %). Propensity matched-pairs analysis was used to match patients undergoing off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting (n = 245) with patients undergoing <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass. ResultsUnivariate analysis revealed decreased hospital mortality (16 / 245, 6. 5 % vs 28 / 245, 11. 4 %; P =. 058) and stroke prevalence (4 / 245, 1. 6 % vs 14 / 245, 5. 7 %; P =. 03) in off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting compared with <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass. Freedom from any postoperative complication was higher in off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting compared with <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass (226 / 245, 92. 2 % vs 196 / 245, 80. 0 %; P <. 001). Multivariable analysis of preoperative risk factors showed that increased hospital mortality was associated with <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass (odds ratio = 2. 7; P =. 01), fewer grafts (P =. 05), acute myocardial infarction (odds ratio = 11. 5; P <. 001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (odds ratio = 2. 4; P =. 03), previous cardiac surgery (odds ratio = 10. 2, P =. 05), and peripheral vascular disease (odds ratio = 2. 1; P =. 05). Cardiopulmonary bypass was the only independent risk factor for stroke (odds ratio = 3. 6, P =. 03). At 36 months' follow-up, comparable survival was observed in the off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting and <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass groups (74 % vs 72 %). Multivariable analysis revealed that renal disease (P <. 001), advanced age (P <. 001), previous myocardial infarction (P =. 03), and lower number of grafts (P =. 02) were independent risks for late mortality.

MethodsFrom January 1997 through June 2002, a total of 12, 845 patients underwent isolated <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting procedures in Providence Health System hospitals. Of these, 1782 operations (14 %) were performed without cardiopulmonary bypass. An operative mortality risk model was derived from on-pump data with logistic regression. This model and two other external risk models developed from on-pump data were then applied to patients undergoing off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting to test the model adequacy. ResultsGood model discrimination and calibration were obtained from all three models. ConclusionOperative mortality risk models developed from on-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting {{can be used to}} assess the risk for off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundPatients at {{high and}} low body mass index {{have been shown to}} {{experience}} higher morbidity and mortality when undergoing <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting. The purpose of this research was to compare outcomes of patients at body mass index extremes who underwent <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting with or without cardiopulmonary bypass. MethodsA retrospective review of 6801 patients with a body mass index 35 undergoing isolated, primary <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting from 1996 to 2009 at Emory Healthcare Hospitals was performed. Patients were compared by therapy either on-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting (n =  3210) or off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting (n =  3591). Salvage patients or those with concomitant operations were excluded. Comparisons were made using multivariable regression analysis, using a propensity score covariate calculated from 41 preoperative risk factors. ResultsA total of 6801 patients, including 4312 with a body mass index 35 (off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting, n =  1127; on-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting, n =  1362) were included for analysis. Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of mortality was significantly higher for both body mass index strata in patients undergoing off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting (2. 8 % vs 3. 1 % for body mass index 35 [P = . 049]). For patients with a body mass index. 05). ConclusionsPatients with {{high and low}} body mass indices experience reduced morbidity and in-hospital mortality when undergoing off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting. Despite a higher risk profile, patients with a body mass index < 25 who underwent off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting experienced a significant reduction in in-hospital mortality...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveControversy exists {{regarding}} the perioperative renal effects of off-pump versus on-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting. Large case-matched and randomized comparisons have shown conflicting results. This study focuses on this clinical controversy. MethodsWe studied 5589 consecutive patients {{from a single}} center who underwent off-pump or on-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting between 2002 and 2010. All preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative data were prospectively collected. Patients were matched by using a nearest neighbor matching estimation method for average treatment effects, with bias correction (Stata 11. 2, StataCorp, College Station, Tex). The matching characteristics were age, gender, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, left ventricular grade, preoperative serum creatinine, operative priority, and Cardiac Anesthesia Risk Evaluation score. ResultsThe mean patient age was 64. 9 ± 10. 0 years, and 4387 (78. 5 %) were male. Mean calculated preoperative creatinine clearance was 82. 0 ± 32. 6 mL/min. Perioperative mortality was 1. 5 % with off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting and 1. 7 % with on-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting (P = . 6). The mean change in creatinine clearance, from the preoperative value to the lowest postoperative value, was − 6. 3 ± 14. 1 mL/min with off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting versus − 5. 0 ± 15. 5 mL/min with on-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting (P = . 06). After matching, patients undergoing off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting had a greater creatinine increase and greater loss of creatinine clearance postoperatively compared with patients undergoing on-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting (both P < . 05). Requirements for de novo postoperative dialysis were equivalent at 2. 6 % in off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting versus 2. 1 % in on-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting (P = . 4). Median postoperative hospital stay was 8 days in both groups (P = . 8). ConclusionsOff-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting does not preserve renal function {{to a greater extent}} than on-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting. In fact, a trend to the reverse exists with no clinically harmful effects...|$|R
2500|$|In late 1977, Orbison was {{not feeling}} well and decided to overwinter in Hawaii. While there, he checked into a {{hospital}} where testing discovered that he had severely obstructed coronary arteries. On January 18, 1978, Orbison underwent a triple <b>coronary</b> <b>bypass.</b> He had suffered from duodenal ulcers since as early as 1960 and had been a heavy smoker since adolescence. He felt revitalized following the triple bypass, but he continued to smoke, and his weight fluctuated {{for the remainder of}} his life. When Orbison felt strong enough to perform again, Scott Mathews took him into the recording studio and produced a version of [...] "Oh, Pretty Woman" [...] for a national radio and television advertising campaign for Tone Soap, a woman's beauty bar. This proved to be a much needed financial windfall for Orbison, as Mathews saw to it that the company paid well to license the use of Orbison's original composition and for Orbison's services.|$|E

2500|$|In 1955, Scruggs {{received}} word that his mother, Lula, {{had suffered a}} stroke and heart attack in North Carolina. The only flight available from Nashville involved such a series of connecting cities {{that it was not}} feasible to fly. Scruggs and his wife, with sons Gary and Randy, decided to drive all night from Nashville [...] to see her when they were involved in an automobile accident just east of Knoxville about 3 a.m. October 2. Their car was hit by a drunk driver, a Ft. Campbell soldier who had pulled out from a side road into their path, then fled the scene after the collision. The children were not hurt, but Earl suffered a fractured pelvis and dislocations of both hips which would plague him for years, and Louise had been thrown into the windshield receiving multiple lacerations. They were flown to a Nashville Hospital where Scruggs remained hospitalized for about two months. He received thousands of letters from well-wishers. He returned to music in January 1956, about four months after the injury, but after working [...] a week or so, one of the hips collapsed, and he returned to the hospital for a metal hip to be implanted. Seven years later, the other hip required similar surgery. The first metal hip lasted for some 40 years, but eventually failed, requiring a total hip replacement in October 1996, when he was age 72. [...] While still in the recovery room after this hip operation, Scruggs suffered a heart attack— he was returned to the operating room later the same day for quintuple <b>coronary</b> <b>bypass</b> surgery. Despite the dire circumstances, he recovered uneventfully and returned to his musical career.|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveBackground {{data were}} {{obtained}} on all California hospitals performing <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting and percutaneous coronary intervention procedures and compared with reports published {{by the state of}} New York to develop a collaborative quality improvement program for cardiac surgery programs. MethodsThe Patient Discharge Database of the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development was queried for the years 1999 – 2001. In-hospital mortality and risk factors for <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting and percutaneous coronary intervention were obtained by using demographic data and International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision-Clinical Modification procedure and diagnosis codes. Risk models were developed by means of logistic regression analysis. ResultsOverall <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting mortality was 33 % higher and percutaneous coronary intervention mortality was twice as high in California compared with that in New York. Procedural volume (per unit population) was higher in New York. In high-volume California hospitals (> 300 procedures per year), <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting mortality was similar (California, 2. 42 %; New York, 2. 25 %). Excess <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting mortality (> 4. 0 %) occurred only in low-volume programs. Risk adjustment did not change the volume effect for <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting. No volume effect was noted for risk-adjusted percutaneous coronary intervention mortality. There were no obvious differences in risk factors between California and New York. Programs performing relatively fewer <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting procedures compared with percutaneous coronary interventions were found to have significantly higher <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting mortality after adjusting for volume effects. Percutaneous coronary intervention volume is increasing and <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting volume is decreasing in both California and New York. ConclusionsExcess <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting mortality in California is related to the large number of low-volume programs. Excess percutaneous coronary intervention mortality might be related to case selection or timing of intervention. A relationship between percutaneous coronary intervention volume and <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting mortality is suggested in which increasing percutaneous coronary intervention volume relative to <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting volume might have the effect of shifting patients with undefined higher risk characteristics to <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting...|$|R
