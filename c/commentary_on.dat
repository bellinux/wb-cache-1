5|$|Calvin {{produced}} {{commentaries on}} most of the books of the Bible. His first <b>commentary</b> <b>on</b> Romans was published in 1540, and he planned to write commentaries on the entire New Testament. Six years passed before he wrote his second, a <b>commentary</b> <b>on</b> First Epistle to the Corinthians, but after that he devoted more attention to reaching his goal. Within four years he had published commentaries on all the Pauline epistles, and he also revised the <b>commentary</b> <b>on</b> Romans. He then {{turned his attention to the}} general epistles, dedicating them to Edward VI of England. By 1555 he had completed his work on the New Testament, finishing with the Acts and the Gospels (he omitted only the brief second and third Epistles of John and the Book of Revelation). For the Old Testament, he wrote commentaries on Isaiah, the books of the Pentateuch, the Psalms, and Joshua. The material for the commentaries often originated from lectures to students and ministers that he reworked for publication. From 1557 onwards, he could not find the time to continue this method, and he gave permission for his lectures to be published from stenographers' notes. These Praelectiones covered the minor prophets, Daniel, Jeremiah, Lamentations, and part of Ezekiel.|$|E

[...] Prior to Mipham, Nyingmapa scholars [...] "had seldom written detailed pedagogical <b>commentaries</b> <b>on</b> the śāstras of exoteric Buddhism." [...] Until his time the colleges or shedra {{associated with the}} great Nyingma monasteries of Kham, such as Dzogchen, Shechen, Kathog, Palyul and Tarthang lacked their own exegetical <b>commentaries</b> <b>on</b> these exoteric Mahayana śāstras, and students commonly studied Gelug <b>commentaries</b> <b>on</b> these fundamental texts. Grounding himself {{in the writings of}} Śāntarakṣita, Rongzom Chokyi Zangpo, and Longchenpa, Mipham produced a whole array of brilliant exegetical <b>commentaries</b> <b>on</b> the great Indian philosophical systems and texts that clearly articulated a Nyingma orientation or view.|$|R

In his own unique way but using terms influenced by the ideas of Mencius, Shen wrote of an autonomous inner authority that formed the basis for one's inclination towards moral choices, a concept linked to Shen's life experiences of surviving and obtaining success through self-reliance.

50|$|<b>Commentaries</b> <b>on</b> Nrisimha-Purvatatapaniya and Shveshvatara Upanishads are {{attributed}} to Adi Shankara, but their authenticity is highly doubtful.

However, in Brahmasutra-Bhasya, Shankara cites some of these Upanishads as he develops his arguments, but the historical notes left by his companions and disciples, along with major differences in style {{and the content of}} the <b>commentaries</b> <b>on</b> later Upanishad have led scholars to conclude that the <b>commentaries</b> <b>on</b> later Upanishads were not Shankara's work.|$|R
