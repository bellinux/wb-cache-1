5|$|Warburton Bridge is {{a privately}} owned {{statutory}} tolled undertaking which incorporates a public highway road length. The high-level <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridge</b> crosses the Manchester Ship Canal on the B5159 road, connecting the A57 with the A6144, and was commissioned under the Rixton & Warburton Bridge Act 1863. The original stone bridge spanned the River Mersey {{prior to its}} later diversion into the Manchester Ship Canal. Both bridges and the unadopted approach roads are privately maintained. It {{is one of the}} few remaining pre-motorway toll bridges in the United Kingdom, and the only one in Greater Manchester.|$|E
5|$|Norman Selfe (9 December 1839– 15 October 1911) was an Australian engineer, naval architect, inventor, urban planner and outspoken {{advocate}} of technical education. After emigrating to Sydney {{with his family}} from England as a boy he became an apprentice engineer, following his father's trade. Selfe designed many bridges, docks, boats, and much precision machinery for the city. He also introduced new refrigeration, hydraulic, electrical and transport systems. For these achievements he received international acclaim during his lifetime. Decades before the Sydney Harbour Bridge was built, the city came close to building a Selfe-designed steel <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridge</b> across the harbour after he won the second public competition for a bridge design.|$|E

50|$|Cantilevers {{are widely}} found in construction, notably in <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridges</b> and {{balconies}} (see corbel). In <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridges</b> the <b>cantilevers</b> are usually built as pairs, with each cantilever {{used to support}} {{one end of a}} central section. The Forth Bridge in Scotland {{is an example of a}} <b>cantilever</b> truss <b>bridge.</b> A <b>cantilever</b> in a traditionally timber framed building is called a jetty or forebay. In the southern United States a historic barn type is the cantilever barn of log construction.|$|R
25|$|The Crescent City Connection (CCC), {{formerly}} the Greater New Orleans Bridge (GNO), refers to twin <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridges</b> that carry U.S. Highway 90 Business (US90 Bus.) over the Mississippi River in New Orleans, Louisiana, United States. They are tied as the fifth-longest <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridges</b> in the world. Each span carries four general-use automobile lanes; additionally the westbound span has two reversible HOV lanes across the river.|$|R
25|$|The High Bridge of Kentucky by C. Shaler Smith (1877), the Niagara <b>Cantilever</b> <b>Bridge</b> by Charles Conrad Schneider (1883) and the Poughkeepsie Bridge by John Francis O'Rourke and Pomeroy P. Dickinson (1889) {{were all}} {{important}} early {{uses of the}} cantilever design. The Kentucky River Bridge spanned a gorge that was 275 feet (84 meters) deep and took {{full advantage of the}} fact that falsework, or temporary support, is not needed for the main span of a <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|E
25|$|A <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridge</b> is {{a bridge}} built using cantilevers, {{structures}} that project horizontally into space, supported {{on only one}} end. For small footbridges, the cantilevers may be simple beams; however, large cantilever bridges designed to handle road or rail traffic use trusses built from structural steel, or box girders built from prestressed concrete. The steel truss <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridge</b> was a major engineering breakthrough when first put into practice, as it can span distances of over , and can be more easily constructed at difficult crossings by virtue of using little or no falsework.|$|E
25|$|The {{flat-top}} shallow <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridge</b> {{consists of}} nine Roman arches that progressively increase in size the {{closer to the}} centre of the span, with the three largest arches slightly peaked. Eight triangularabutments protect the base of the bridge from debris, while polygonal structures downstream act as reinforcements.|$|E

The Hassfurt Bridge over the Main river in Germany with a central span of 124 feet (38 meters) was completed in 1867 and is recognized as the first modern <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Commodore Barry Bridge is a <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridge</b> {{that spans}} the Delaware River from Chester, Pennsylvania to Bridgeport in Logan Township. Owned and {{operated}} by the Delaware River Port Authority, construction of the bridge began in 1969 and the bridge opened to traffic in February 1974. The bridge is named for the American Revolutionary War hero and Philadelphia resident, John Barry.|$|E
25|$|In 1886, the Manhattan Bridge Building Company was {{organized}} {{to finance the}} construction. Among the prominent backers was Henry Clay Frick, the coal tycoon and associate of Andrew Carnegie. The Union Bridge Company of Athens, Pennsylvania, which had completed the Michigan Central <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridge</b> at Niagara (see Niagara <b>Cantilever</b> <b>Bridge),</b> was subcontracted to build the Poughkeepsie Bridge. Dawson, Symmes and Usher were the foundation engineers, while John F. O'Rourke, P. P. Dickinson and Arthur B. Paine were the structural engineers. The bridge was designed by Charles Macdonald and Arthur B. Paine. As is typical for cantilever bridges, construction {{was carried out by}} constructing cribwork, masonry piers, towers, fixed truss sections on falsework, and finally cantilever sections, with the final cantilever interconnection (suspended) spans floated out or raised with falsework. The first train crossed the bridge on December 29, 1888, and it was formally opened for scheduled passenger service on January 1, 1889.|$|E

25|$|While the Niagara {{bridge was}} being built, Roebling {{undertook}} a railway suspension {{bridge across the}} Kentucky River, which required a clear span of 1,224 feet (373 m). The anchorage and stone towers were completed, and the cable wire delivered along with the material for the superstructure, when the railway company became insolvent. The bridge construction was halted. It was later completed as the first <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridge</b> in the US, with a truss for carrying the railway track.|$|E
25|$|Until the {{construction}} of the Ava (Innwa) Bridge, a 16 span rail and road <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridge</b> built by the British colonial government in 1934, the only way across the Irrawaddy was by ferry. The bridge was destroyed by the retreating British Army during the World War II and was rebuilt in 1954 after Burmese independence and was the only bridge to span the Irrawaddy until recent times when a spate of bridge construction has been carried out by the government.|$|E
25|$|The present bridge {{replaced}} a steel <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridge</b> of {{the same}} name. The original two-lane bridge built by the Virginia Bridge Company was opened to traffic on September 6, 1954, with a similar structure built parallel and {{to the west of}} it in 1969 to make it a four-lane bridge and bring it to Interstate Highway standards. Opening of the newer span was delayed until 1971 for reinforcing of the south main pier, which had cracked due to insufficient supporting pile depth. The second span was used for all southbound traffic, while the original span was converted to carry northbound traffic.|$|E

50|$|Mountainous Bhutan {{has always}} relied on bridges for travel across its many steep ravines and rushing rivers prone to {{disastrous}} flooding. The most traditional bridges of Bhutan are its <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridges,</b> however the kingdom also has several large suspension bridges.|$|R
25|$|A common way to {{construct}} steel truss and prestressed concrete cantilever spans is to counterbalance each cantilever arm with another cantilever arm projecting the opposite direction, forming a balanced cantilever; when they attach to a solid foundation, the counterbalancing arms are called anchor arms. Thus, in a bridge built on two foundation piers, {{there are four}} cantilever arms: two which span the obstacle, and two anchor arms which extend away from the obstacle. Because {{of the need for}} more strength at the balanced cantilever's supports, the bridge superstructure often takes the form of towers above the foundation piers. The Commodore Barry Bridge is an example of this type of <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Walkway {{over the}} Hudson (also {{known as the}} Poughkeepsie Bridge, Poughkeepsie Railroad Bridge, Poughkeepsie-Highland Railroad Bridge, and High Bridge) is a steel <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridge</b> {{spanning}} the Hudson River between Poughkeepsie, New York, on the east bank and Highland, New York, on the west bank. Built as a double track railroad bridge, it was completed on January 1, 1889, and formed part of the Maybrook Railroad Line. It {{was taken out of}} service on May 8, 1974, after it was damaged by fire. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, and its entry updated in 2008. It was reopened on October 3, 2009 as a pedestrian walkway as part of the new Walkway Over the Hudson State Historic Park.|$|E
25|$|The 1920s and 1930s were a {{relatively}} busy period for Steinman. His firm {{was involved in}} many significant projects including the Hercilio Luz Bridge (or Florianópolis Bridge, 1926), the Carquinez Strait Bridge (1927, {{at the time the}} second largest <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridge</b> in the US), the Mount Hope Bridge and Grand Mère Suspension Bridge (both 1929), the St. Johns Bridge and Waldo-Hancock Bridge (both 1931), the Sky Ride (1933 passenger transporter bridge at the Chicago Century of Progress exposition), the Henry Hudson Bridge (1936, particularly gratifying as this bridge realised his PhD thesis proposal), the Wellesley and Hill Islands Bridge, Wellesley Island Suspension Bridge and Georgina Island Bridge (all 1938 and part of the Thousand Islands Bridge System), the Deer Isle Bridge and the Sullivan-Hutsonville Bridge (both 1939).|$|E
25|$|A {{cable-stayed}} bridge has {{one or more}} towers (or pylons), from which cables support the bridge deck. A distinctive feature are the cables which run directly from the tower to the deck, normally forming a fan-like pattern or a series of parallel lines. This {{is in contrast to}} the modern suspension bridge, where the cables supporting the deck are suspended vertically from the main cable, anchored {{at both ends of the}} bridge and running between the towers. The {{cable-stayed bridge}} is optimal for spans longer than <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridges</b> and shorter than suspension bridges. This is the range where <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridges</b> would rapidly grow heavier if the span were lengthened, while suspension bridge cabling would not be more economical if the span were shortened.|$|R
50|$|Both of the Bi-State Vietnam Gold Star <b>Bridges</b> are <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridges.</b> The {{northbound}} bridge stands 100 ft {{over the}} Ohio River with a main span of 720 ft, with the steel gridwork extending 100 ft above the driving surface. The southbound span has a main span of 600 ft.|$|R
50|$|The Kettle Falls Bridges is the {{collective}} {{name for a}} pair of steel <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridges</b> carrying State Route 20/U.S. Route 395 and the BNSF Railway across the Columbia River at Kettle Falls, Washington. The south bridge carries motor vehicle traffic while the similar northern span is used for rail.|$|R
25|$|The old <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridge</b> was {{connected}} to the Yerba Buena tunnel with a double-deck truss causeway that included a curved section. As this structure occupied an area that must be clear for the new bridge approach, it was necessary to construct an entirely new, temporary approach to the old bridge. This was required to swing to the south to clear the area for new construction, and then back to the north with a more severe curve to connect to the cantilever. As there would only be a few days available during which the bridge could be shut to traffic, the curved portion was built adjacent to its final position on a trestle that extended beneath and beyond the old curved connector. During replacement, the old section was jacked out of the way (to the north), and the new section jacked into place.|$|E
25|$|The Mississippi River Bridge Authority, {{known since}} 1989 as the Crescent City Connection Division (CCCD), began {{construction}} of the first span in November 1954, which opened in April 1958 as the Greater New Orleans Bridge. At its opening, the bridge was the longest <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridge</b> in the world, although in terms of main span length it was third after the Forth Bridge and the Quebec Bridge. It carried two lanes of traffic in each direction, and spurred growth in the suburban area known as the West Bank (for its location on the western bank of the river; it is geographically southeast of New Orleans). Construction of the second span began in March 1981. Despite promises {{that it would be}} ready for the 1984 Louisiana World Exposition, it did not open to traffic until September 1988. The second span was originally designated as the Greater New Orleans Bridge No. 2. Both bridges were designed by Modjeski & Masters, Inc.. As soon as the new span was opened, the old span was temporarily closed in phases to replace the asphalt-on-steel deck with concrete. All the exits and entrances to the bridge were replaced as well.|$|E
