The full JSM is tested by investigating perceived work demands, job control and social support. The predictive capability of the full JSM (which encompasses job demands, job control and social support) is applied to a sample of <b>construction</b> <b>project</b> <b>managers</b> from the UK.

40|$|In such complex {{technological}} {{industry as}} constructions where contracts are estimated with million Euro budgets, where competition is fierce and penalties are high, it’s essential for contractors to ensure all management activities facilitate project success. Today many <b>construction</b> companies practice <b>project</b> management approach and employ <b>project</b> <b>managers</b> {{in charge of}} project success. This thesis aims {{to find out whether}} <b>project</b> <b>manager’s</b> leadership style has impact on <b>construction</b> <b>project</b> outcome, and if <b>project</b> <b>managers</b> should emphasize task-motivated or relationship-oriented leadership style in order to facilitate project success. As conducted theory review has shown there has been some prior research on leadership style impact on project outcome. Researchers have generally agreed that <b>project</b> <b>manager’s</b> leadership style is one of the project success’ factors. But studies of particular styles’ impact on <b>construction</b> <b>project</b> outcome mostly presented results with regard to transactional and transformational leadership which describe leader’s ability to cope with tasks when organizations are facing considerable change. However research lacks studies on task and relationship motivation of <b>construction</b> <b>project</b> <b>managers.</b> This study was conducted in order to fill in the blank in prior research and to provide basement for further studies. A sample of 24 Russian <b>construction</b> <b>project</b> <b>managers</b> was surveyed on their leadership style (task-motivated or relationship-oriented) and on success rate of <b>construction</b> <b>projects</b> completed by each respondent. Results have shown that there is moderate correlation between leadership style of <b>construction</b> <b>project</b> <b>managers</b> and that in order to facilitate <b>construction</b> <b>project</b> success, <b>project</b> <b>managers</b> should adhere to task accomplishment before establishing good interpersonal relationships with involved people.
