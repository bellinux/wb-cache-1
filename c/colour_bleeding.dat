40|$|In {{this thesis}} work, several {{prominent}} visual {{effects of a}} snow surface under a strong light source, for instance, the sun, have been identified and modeled, which includes glittering, micro shadows and regional translucency due to subsurface light scattering. The glittering effect was implemented using blooming technique which makes candidate pixels’ <b>colours</b> <b>bleed</b> into their neighbours. Normal mapping and horizon map were experimented in attempt to obtain small surface details and micro shadows. In the end, a curvature-based local illumination model was devised instead to soften such a requirement as modeling micro shadows. From this local model, we gained regional light enhancement or suppression {{as well as a}} regional translucency effect. The light suppression effect can be considered as a kind of local shadowing effect. A surface point’s mean curvature was employed in this model. All these effects were modeled {{in such a way that}} the rendering of them is capable of being carried out on an average machine at an interactive frame rate...|$|R

5000|$|The Puggsy {{character}} originally {{appeared in}} an Amiga demo named Puggs in Space, {{which was created}} and designed by Dionysus, a demogroup formed Lee Carus, Alan McCarthy and Tim Wright. The management of Psygnosis {{was impressed by the}} demo, and asked Dionysus to develop a game based around Puggsy. However, Wright said that the contract with Psygnosis to produce a game was [...] "short-lived", stating the company [...] "didn't really 'get' where we were going with the game". The demogroup was pulled out of the game's development, which was then shifted to Traveller's Tales. Jon Burton, the studio's founder, stated: [...] "It was a bit beyond the guys who created the demo. So in the end, Psygnosis asked us if we could create a game using the character." [...] Puggsy was designed and programmed by Burton, while Andy Ingram handled the graphic design and artwork for the game. While the character design for Puggsy was retained from the demo, the developers changed his colour from red to orange to prevent the consoles from <b>colour</b> <b>bleeding.</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an environment to evaluate image codecs for the <b>colour</b> <b>bleeding</b> artefacts objectively. It {{is difficult to}} detect and measure individual artefacts in coded images. A synthetic random colour test pattern generator and a colour gamut transfer algorithm are developed to emphasise and measure <b>colour</b> <b>bleeding</b> artefacts due to image compression. The performances of a JPEG and a JPEG 2000 codec implementations are compared in colour reproduction for television colour gamut. Both types of codecs show an increasing level of <b>colour</b> <b>bleeding</b> artefacts with increasing compression ratio. The objective artefact measures {{can be used in}} the image codec development process, in parameter optimisation of codec performance and in selecting a codec for a given application. Artefact metrics {{can also be used to}} select suitable parameters for video codecs while creating video streams for the Internet applications and in any multimedia application in general...|$|E

50|$|Attribute clash (also {{known as}} <b>colour</b> clash or <b>bleeding)</b> is a display {{artifact}} caused by limits in the graphics circuitry of some colour 8-bit home computers, {{most notably the}} Sinclair ZX Spectrum, where it meant that only two colours {{could be used in}} any 8×8 tile of pixels.

40|$|This paper studies colour {{filtering}} with particular reference to <b>colour</b> <b>bleeding</b> for median and mode filters. While confirming that multiple single-channel implementation gives especially serious <b>colour</b> <b>bleeding,</b> the paper {{goes on to}} argue that the conventional solution – of using the vector median – is overstrenuous for many types of application. In fact, instead of insisting that the output vector should be identical to one of the input vectors, it will often be better to output the vector that minimises the sum of distances in colour space to all the input vectors. This paper takes as example two uniform colour regions separated by a chasm of different colour and varying width – which provides the simplest instance in which <b>colour</b> <b>bleeding</b> can occur. The findings of the paper should be transferable to other applications such as mode filtering which use median filters as a first stage in the computation. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of luminance on <b>colour</b> <b>bleeding</b> artefacts. <b>Colour</b> <b>bleeding</b> artefacts are the distortions due to sub sampling and quantisation of colour images during compression. Performance of the IrfanView ™ JPEG and JEG 2000 codecs were evaluated for colour reproduction under varying luminance levels. Authors argue that the luminance signal, Y influence the hue of a colour image. Six colour test patterns having same hue and step luminance values were designed and used to compress and reconstruct with the Irfanview ™ codecs. The luminance affects the hue of the reconstructed image differently for different hue values. The relationship cannot be generalised that increasing luminance values result in increasing hue errors. At some luminance values, hue did not show any errors. However, in general, with increasing compression ratio the <b>colour</b> <b>bleeding</b> due to the cross luminance effect increases. Based on the proposed methodology, the Irfanview ™ JPEG 2000 codec outperformed the JPEG codec for colour reproduction...|$|E
40|$|Interreflection (or mutual illumination) {{occurs when}} {{two or more}} object {{surfaces}} are illuminated both by a light source and the light reflected from other surfaces. As the distance or angle between two interreflecting surfaces decreases, the intensity of interreflected light increases, with a corresponding shift in colour known as <b>colour</b> <b>bleeding.</b> For computer vision algorithms that assume spatially invariant surface reflectances, this plays a confounding role. As an example, {{in the presence of}} interreflection, "shape-from-shading" methods will incorrectly reconstruct surfaces such that the orientation of their surface normals will appear to be closer to the direction of the illuminant than they actually are...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{clinical}} trial investigated {{the influence of}} short-term ibuprofen therapy on the early phase of the treatment of adult chronic periodontitis. The subjects were 17 patients in good general health referred for specialist periodontal treatment, having moderate chronic adult periodontitis. A series of assessments were made every 2 weeks over an 8 -week period, including evaluations of oral hygiene, gingival inflammation and probing pocket depths. All participants received oral hygiene instruction, and following baseline examinations, had half the dentition, chosen at random, treated by scaling and root planing. The patients were randomly distributed into 2 groups, a test group receiving a 14 -day course of 800 mg ibuprofen daily, in 4 divided doses, and a control group who did not receive any drug regime. At the 2 -week assessment following the drug regime, significantly greater reduction in gingival <b>bleeding,</b> <b>colour</b> and pocketing was detected in the test compared with the control group. The beneficial effects were less evident thereafter. Although clinical application of the regime {{used in this study}} would not be justified by these results, further research into anti-inflammatory agents as an adjunct in the treatment of periodontal diseases could be considered, {{in the light of the}} beneficial effect on gingivitis in the early phase of periodontal treatment reported.

40|$|The {{present study}} evaluates the {{potential}} association of periodontal diseases among the indigenous "Garo" population in Bangladesh with their lifestyle, diabetes mellitus and routine oral health care practices. Adult {{males and females}} of the community were selected for the study. Data were recorded through one to one, face-to-face interview using a set of standard questionnaire. All teeth except the third molars were examined at 6 sites for gingival <b>colour</b> and swelling, <b>bleeding</b> on probing, probing pocket depths (PPD) and clinical attachment level (CAL). Gingival Index (GI) was recorded according to Loe and Silness. The greatest score {{for each of the}} 6 sites was used for assessing the PPD and CAL. Of 240 subjects, 64 % were female. The mean number of teeth present was 26, and the mean number of affected teeth was 8. 9 (PPD ≥ 3 mm). The mean ± standard deviations of GI, PPD and CAL of the community were 0. 43 ± 0. 70, 2. 34 ± 0. 47 and 2. 70 ± 0. 77 respectively. Betel-leaf was chewed by 75 %, 57. 5 % were tooth brush user and remaining 42. 5 % used traditional ways. A statistically significant difference in PPD and CAL was found between smokers and non-smokers; tooth-brush users and non-users; diabetics and non-diabetics. PPD and CAL were significantly high among frequent betel-leaf chewers and in older age-group. Without having an access to a professional dentist or part of any oral health care awareness programme, the relatively low prevalence of periodontal diseases can possibly be attributed, in part, to the traditional eating habits of the indigenous "Garo" population...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a framework of}} test methodology to assess spatial domain compression artefacts produced by image and intra-frame coded video codecs. Few researchers have studied this broad range of artefacts. A taxonomy of image and video compression artefacts is proposed. This {{is based on the}} point of origin of the artefact in the image communication model. This thesis presents objective evaluation of distortions known as artefacts due to image and intra-frame coded video compression made using synthetic test patterns. The American National Standard Institute document ANSI T 1 801 qualitatively defines blockiness, blur and ringing artefacts. These definitions have been augmented with quantitative definitions in conjunction with test patterns proposed. A test and measurement environment is proposed in which the codec under test is exercised using a portfolio of test patterns. The test patterns are designed to highlight the artefact under study. Algorithms have been developed to detect and measure individual artefacts based on the characteristics of respective artefacts. Since the spatial contents of the original test patterns form known structural details, the artefact distortion metrics based on the characteristics of those artefacts are clean and swift to calculate. Distortion metrics are validated using a human vision system inspired modern image quality metric. Blockiness, blur and ringing artefacts are evaluated for representative codecs using proposed synthetic test patterns. <b>Colour</b> <b>bleeding</b> due to image and video compression is discussed with both qualitative and quantitative definitions for the <b>colour</b> <b>bleeding</b> artefacts introduced. The image reproduction performance of a few codecs was evaluated to ascertain the utility of proposed metrics and test patterns...|$|E
40|$|Wavelength {{dependent}} Monte Carlo rendering can {{correctly and}} generally capture effects such as spectral caustics (rainbows) and chromatic abberation. It also improves the colour accuracy of reflectance models and of illumination effects such as <b>colour</b> <b>bleeding</b> and metamerism. The stratified wavelength clustering (SWC) strategy carries several wavelength stratified radiance samples along each light transport path. The cluster is split into several paths or degraded {{into a single}} path only if a specular refraction at {{the surface of a}} dispersive material is encountered along the path. The overall efficiency of this strategy is high since the fraction of clusters that need to be split or degraded in a typical scene is low, and also because specular dispersion tends to decrease the source colour variance, offseting the increased amortized cost of generating each path...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{paper and}} ink interactions related to inkjet printing. The {{main purpose of}} this work was to gain a deeper understanding in which parameters control the flow of ink into papers and how the ink interacts with the paper surface. The overall objective was to find key parameters to optimize the print quality in inkjet printing. Characterization of paper-surfaces in terms of porosity, surface roughness and surface energy was made. Objective and subjective measurements were used for print quality evaluation. Light microscopy imaging and SEM was used to see how ink interacts with the paper surface in a printed image. A high speed camera was used to study the absorption of picolitre sized inkjet droplets into fine papers. An initial study {{on the effect of}} paper properties on print quality was made. Result indicated that there were small differences in print quality for pilot papers with different composition (in a specific parameter window) and the commercial paper COLORLOK® reproduced a noticeable high colour gamut compared to the other samples. Research was made to see how surface fixation can affect the print quality for printouts made with pigmented ink. Surface fixation promotes retention of the pigmented colorant in the outermost surface layer of the paper and has been denoted “colorant fixation” in this thesis. It was shown that applying colorant fixation onto a paper surface before printing can increase the detail reproduction in a printed image. Different concentrations of calcium chloride were applied onto the paper surface on fullscale produced non-commercial papers. Test printing was made with a SoHo (Small office/Home office) printer using pigmented ink and results showed that using calcium chloride as surface treatment can lead to aggregation of pigments at the surface resulting in a higher detail reproduction. Fast absorption of the carrier liquid into the paper and fast fixation of colourants on the surface is important in inkjet printing to avoid colour to <b>colour</b> <b>bleeding.</b> These demands will be more pronounced when the printing speed increases. It is important to understand which parameters affect the absorption process to be able to control the mechanisms and to optimize the print quality. A study of absorption of picolitre size inkjet droplets into fine paper was made in this work. Theoretical equations describing fluid absorption into capillaries were tested and compared with experimental results. The result showed that the time dependence in the Lucas-Washburn (L-W) equation fits fairly well to data whereas the L-W equation overestimates the penetration depth. The results are directly applicable to paper and printing industry and {{can be used as a}} base for future studies of absorption of picolitre sized droplets into porous materials and for studies of aggregation of colloidal particles on surfaces.
