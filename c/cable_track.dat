50|$|The system {{consists}} of three types of stations: Power Stations with 135 hp (101 kW) electric motors, powering one or both connecting sections. Terminal stations in Forsby and Köping where the limestone was loaded/unloaded also functioned as power stations. Angle stations lack motors and only change {{the angle of the}} <b>cable</b> <b>track</b> by splicing together two sections powered from their respective other sides. Station buildings have an iron frame, wooden walls and roof constructed from asbestos cement. The pulling cables go in endless loops between stations, and kept taut by counterweights in towers in the power stations. The heavier carrying cable is divided into four runs along each section, connected by tension stations. These stations are comparatively small, simple structures regulating cable tension along the way.|$|E

40|$|The {{changes of}} the seabed {{environment}} caused by a natural disaster or human activities dramatically affect {{the life span of}} the subsea buried cable. It is essential to <b>track</b> the <b>cable</b> route in order to inspect the condition of the buried cable and protect its surviving seabed environment. The magnetic sensor is instrumental in guiding the remotely-operated vehicle (ROV) to track and inspect the buried cable underseas. In this paper, a novel framework integrating the underwater cable localization method with the magnetic guidance and control algorithm is proposed, in order to enable the automatic <b>cable</b> <b>tracking</b> by a three-degrees-of-freedom (3 -DOF) under-actuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) without human beings in the loop. The work relies on the passive magnetic sensing method to localize the subsea cable by using two tri-axial magnetometers, and a new analytic formulation is presented to compute the heading deviation, horizontal offset and buried depth of the cable. With the magnetic localization, the <b>cable</b> <b>tracking</b> and inspection mission is elaborately constructed as a straight-line path following control problem in the horizontal plane. A dedicated magnetic line-of-sight (LOS) guidance is built based on the relative geometric relationship between the vehicle and the cable, and the feedback linearizing technique is adopted to design a simplified <b>cable</b> <b>tracking</b> controller considering the side-slip effects, such that the under-actuated vehicle is able to move towards the subsea cable and then inspect its buried environment, which further guides the environmental protection of the cable by setting prohibited fishing/anchoring zones and increasing the buried depth. Finally, numerical simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed magnetic guidance and control algorithm on the envisioned subsea <b>cable</b> <b>tracking</b> and the potential protection of the seabed environment along the cable route...|$|R
40|$|The Experimental Facilities Division {{requires}} a labeling system {{to identify and}} catalog the instrumentation, control, and computer cables that will run throughout the building. Tom Sheridan from the MIS Group has already made some general suggestions about the information that could be included in an Oracle-based <b>Cable</b> <b>Tracking</b> System (E-mail text distributed by Gary Gunderson on the 27 th of August). Glenn Decker`s LS Note No. 191 is also relevant to the subject since it addresses name assignment rules for the storage ring devices. The intent of this note is to recommend a mechanism for tracking wires/cables, with enough specifics, to which all groups in the Division would adhere when pulling cables. Because most cables will run between various beamline devices, hutch safety components, and equipment racks, any method of <b>tracking</b> <b>cables</b> {{is related to the}} Equipment Tracking System. That system has been developed by the APS Project personnel and is described in the APS Project Equipment Tracking System Guidelines (DRAFT). It can be adopted to XFD`s needs. Two essential features of the <b>Cable</b> <b>Tracking</b> System are: 1) Each cable shell have a unique Identifier, and 2) Cable label must contain information that is helpful during troubleshooting in the field. The Identifier is an alphanumeric string of characters that will originate in the Oraclebased <b>Cable</b> <b>Tracking</b> System.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{proposes a}} field {{application}} of a high-level Reinforcement Learning (RL) control system for solving the action selection problem of an autonomous robot in a <b>cable</b> <b>tracking</b> task. The underwater vehicle ICTINEUAUV learns to perform a visual based <b>cable</b> <b>tracking</b> task in a two step learning process. First, a policy is computed by means of simulation where a hydrodynamic model of the vehicle simulates the cable following task. Once the simulated results are accurate enough, in a second step, the learned-in-simulation policy is transferred to the vehicle where the learning procedure continues in a real environment, improving the initial policy. The natural actor-critic (NAC) algorithm has been selected {{to solve the problem}} in both steps. This algorithm aims to take advantage of policy gradient and value function techniques for fast convergence. Actor’s policy gradient gives convergence guarantees under function approximation and partial observability while critic’s value function reduces variance of the estimates update improving the convergence process.

40|$|The uses of subsea cables {{range from}} {{telecommunication}} through to power cables. From {{time to time}} these cables need repairing or removing so need to be located. Current technology in subsea <b>cable</b> <b>tracking</b> {{is based on the}} detection of a magnetic field that surrounds a live cable. This can either be present in the cable (at 50 Hz) or induced in the cable from a shore base station (25 Hz). This project explores the location technique, known as pulse induction metal detecting, by testing frequencies between 10 - 99 Hz in both air and seawater, the aim being to find the optimum cable detection frequency using the pulse induction technique. An existing model was used to calculate the expected signal responses in air. This model was found to be in good agreement with the observations. It was then developed further so it could be used to model the subsea signal response. The model included a signal attenuation factor, as the resistivity of seawater is much higher than in air. The subsea observations were enhanced much further than expected. This was found to be caused by the positive and negative salt ions disassociating when a VLF AC current was present in seawater, enhancing the conductivity, hence the magnetic field by causing an electromagnetic current of their own. A conductivity term was developed to model the signal enhancement. This term was incorporated into the existing model so accurate subsea calculations could be produced. The new model was used, along with the observations, to identify the optimum frequency for subsea <b>cable</b> <b>tracking.</b> The 99 Hz frequency was found to be the optimum subsea <b>cable</b> <b>tracking</b> frequency due to its strong, stable, predictable and detectable signal. This frequency would make subsea cables easier to detect using the pulse induction technique. Faculty of Scienc...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To {{estimate}} {{influence of}} elastic deformations of the <b>track</b> <b>cable</b> arising at movement of cars, on effort in a hauling rope of the aerial ropeway. Methodology. The method of consecutive approaches {{was used for}} research influence of elastic deformations of a <b>track</b> <b>cable</b> on effort in a hauling rope. Thus, definition of a tension of a <b>track</b> <b>cable</b> was carried out with use of the technique based on principles of modular configuration, the essence of which consists in formation of mathematical model {{by a combination of}} blocks of the formulas describing balance of the <b>track</b> <b>cable</b> on supports. Findings. The research has shown that influence of elastic deformations of a <b>track</b> <b>cable</b> on effort in a hauling rope was insignificant (less than 1 %). That points to possibility not to consider change of the <b>track</b> <b>cable</b> length, caused by its elastic properties, when modeling loading of elements of system «drive – traction rope – tension device». Also it has been found that use of the tension device of a <b>track</b> <b>cable</b> increased influence of its elastic properties on loading of rope system elements. At the same time the elastic component of the <b>track</b> <b>cable</b> tension in the test flight does not depend on a car position in the adjacent span, but only determines by the parameters of the rope system. Originality. The possibility of excluding the changes of <b>track</b> <b>cable</b> length caused by its elastic properties, when modeling loading of elements of system «drive – traction rope – tension device» was proved. Practical value.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a control architecture for an {{autonomous underwater vehicle}} (AUV) named the Component Oriented Layer-based Architecture for Autonomy (COLA 2). The proposal implements a component-oriented layer-based control architecture structured in three layers: the reactive layer, the execution layer, and the mission layer. Concerning the reactive layer, to improve the vehicle primitives' adaptability to unknown changing environments, reinforcement learning (RL) techniques have been programmed. Starting from a learned-in-simulation policy, the RL-based primitive cableTracking has been trained to follow an underwater cable in a real experiment inside a water tank using the Ictineu AUV. The execution layer implements a discrete event system (DES) based on Petri nets (PNs). PNs {{have been used to}} safely model the primitives' execution flow by means of Petri net building block (PNBBs) that have been designed according to some reachability properties showing {{that it is possible to}} compose them preserving these qualities. The mission layer describes the mission phases using a high-level mission control language (MCL), which is automatically compiled into a PN. The MCL {{presents a}}greeable properties of simplicity and structured programming. MCL can be used to describe offline imperative missions or to describe planning operators, in charge of solving a particular phase of a mission. If planning operators are defined, an onboard planner will be able to sequence them to achieve the proposed goals.
