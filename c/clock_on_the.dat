5|$|Somervell still pursued his own designs, making {{important}} changes, {{including the}} addition of a fifth story. The outbreak of war led to a new urgency, and by May 1942, some 13,000 workers were working around the <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> building, which was completed in early 1943 at a cost of $63 million, the overrun being caused by the emphasis on speed and {{the addition of}} the extra floor. For his work with the Construction Division, Somervell was awarded an oak leaf cluster to his Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} is mainly 14thcentury although the east {{wall of the}} chancel contains remnants of 12th-century material, including two clamped buttresses. The ashlar-faced tower is 14thcentury with angled buttresses north and south. The west window has three lights with flowing tracery. The <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east face of the tower, dated 1876, is by JB Joyce & Co of Whitchurch, Shropshire, the oldest firm of tower clockmakers in the world; it is wound weekly by the churchwardens.|$|E
5|$|Alcatraz cellhouse had a {{corridor}} naming system named after major American streets and landmarks. Michigan Avenue was {{the corridor to}} the side of A-Block, and Broadway was the central corridor in which the inmates would assemble as they massed through Times Square (an area with a <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wall), before entering the dining hall for their meals. Broadway separated Block-B and Block-C and prisoners kept along it had the least privacy in the prison. The corridor between Block-C and the library was called Park Avenue. The corridor in D-Block was named Sunset Strip. Gun galleries lay {{at the end of each}} block, including the West and East Gun Galleries.|$|E
50|$|Special {{and general}} {{relativity}} predict that <b>the</b> <b>clocks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> GPS satellites {{would be seen}} by the Earth's observers to run 38 microseconds faster per day than <b>the</b> <b>clocks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Earth. The GPS calculated positions would quickly drift into error, accumulating to 10 kilometers per day. This was corrected for in the design of GPS.|$|R
50|$|Gravitational time {{dilation}} {{has been}} experimentally measured using atomic <b>clocks</b> <b>on</b> airplanes. <b>The</b> <b>clocks</b> aboard the airplanes were slightly faster than <b>clocks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. The effect is significant {{enough that the}} Global Positioning System's artificial satellites need to have their clocks corrected.|$|R
50|$|Serial data to <b>the</b> MCU is <b>clocked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{rising edge}} and data from <b>the</b> MCU is <b>clocked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> falling edge.

The second byte (0x53) will be echoed back by the MCU.|$|R
5|$|Clock {{towers in}} Western Europe in the Middle Ages were also {{sometimes}} striking clocks. The most famous original still standing is possibly St Mark's <b>Clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top of St Mark's Clocktower in St Mark's Square in Venice, assembled in 1493 by the clockmaker Gian Carlo Rainieri from Reggio Emilia. In 1497, Simone Campanato moulded the great bell on which every definite time-lapse is beaten by two mechanical bronze statues (h. 2,60 m.) called Due Mori (Two Moors), handling a hammer. Possibly earlier (1490) is the Prague Astronomical Clock by clockmaster Jan Růže (also called Hanuš) – according to another source this device was assembled {{as early as}} 1410 by clockmaker Mikuláš of Kadaň and mathematician Jan Šindel. The allegorical parade of animated sculptures rings on the hour every day.|$|E
5|$|St James' Church, Stretham, is {{an active}} Anglican church {{in the village of}} Stretham, Cambridgeshire, England. Founded in the 12th century, it was heavily {{restored}} by the architect J.P.StAubyn in 1876. English Heritage, a body responsible for preserving historical sites in the United Kingdom, assessed the church a Grade II* listed building. The turret <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east face of the tower was also made in 1876, by JB Joyce & Co of Whitchurch, Shropshire, and still keeps good time. The church has a ring of sixbells hung for change ringing. Regular ringing resumed at the church in June 2011 after several years' silence. St James' is one of eight churches in the Ely Team Ministry.|$|E
5|$|The Fairmont model {{opened up}} the luxury sector for the BA range. Externally, the Fairmont could be {{distinguished}} from the other BA models with its 16-inch alloy wheels and grey mesh grille with chrome surround. Some of the standard features included traction control and dual-zone climate control air conditioning, an analogue <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top centre console stack, wood grain highlights, and velour upholstery. Automatic headlights, which turn off or on depending on surrounding environmental conditions, were now standard on the Fairmont model. In addition to this, the Fairmont also received illuminated footwells. The basic mechanical setup carried over from the XT, although buyers could opt for the Barra 220 V8 engine.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{wireless}} network, the problem {{becomes even more}} challenging due {{to the possibility of}} collision of <b>the</b> synchronization packets <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wireless medium and the higher drift rate of <b>clocks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> low-cost wireless devices.|$|R
50|$|Such time {{dilation}} {{has been}} repeatedly demonstrated, for instance by small disparities {{in a pair}} of atomic clocks after one of them is sent on a space trip, or by <b>clocks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Space Shuttle running slightly slower than reference <b>clocks</b> <b>on</b> Earth, or <b>clocks</b> <b>on</b> GPS and Galileo satellites running slightly faster. Time dilation has also been the subject of science fiction works, as it technically provides the means for forward time travel.|$|R
50|$|The power {{consumption}} of atomic clocks varies with their size. Atomic <b>clocks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{scale of one}} chip require less than 30 milliwatt; Primary frequency and time standards like the United States Time Standard atomic clocks, NIST-F1 and NIST-F2, use far greater quantities of power.|$|R
5|$|The White House is {{connected}} to The Barn (originally The Stables), a red-brick building built in 1926. The archway in {{the centre of the}} building was originally an open passageway. It now houses the reception area for the Training and Event Centre. The first floor of the building was used as training rooms for Cub Scout Leaders. The <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front of the building was a gift from a former Japanese Chief Scout, Count Sano, who was present at an early training course at Gilwell Park. The weather vane on the roof depicts Dick Turpin, who was rumoured to live on the site.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} a <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tower since the early 1700s. There is a peal of eight bells in the tower. Tenor 28cwt (3,136lb/1,422kg) in C. The {{original}} five bells were re-cast by the celebrated Thomas Bilbie of Chew Stoke in 1735 to make a peal of six, and in 1898 four of these were re-cast and two were repaired by Messrs. Mears and Stainbank of London to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. Two additional bells, the gift of Brigadier Ommanney, were added in 1928 to complete the octave, which still contains two of the Bilbie bells. The present clock, installed in 1903, plays a verse of a hymn every four hours, at 8am, noon, 4 and 8pm, with a different hymn tune for {{every day of the}} week. The church is a Grade I listed building.|$|E
5|$|Hogarth {{replicates}} all {{the features}} of the pastoral scene in an urban landscape. The shepherds and shepherdesses become the beggars and whores, the sun overhead is replaced by the <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> church, the snow-capped mountains become the snowy rooftops. Even the setting of Covent Garden with piles of fruit and vegetables echoes the country scene. In the centre of the picture the icy goddess of the dawn {{in the form of the}} prim churchgoer is followed by her shivering red-nosed pageboy, mirroring Hesperus, the dawn bearer. The woman is the only one who seems unaffected by the cold, suggesting it may be her element. Although outwardly shocked, the dress of the woman, which is too fashionable for a woman of her age and in the painting is shown to be a striking acid yellow, may suggest she has other thoughts on her mind. She is commonly described as a spinster, and considered to be a hypocrite, ostentatiously attending church and carrying a fashionable ermine muff while displaying no charity to her freezing footboy or the half-seen beggar before her. The figure of the spinster is said to be based on a relative of Hogarth, who, recognising herself in the picture, cut him out of her will. Fielding later used the woman as the model for his character of Bridget Allworthy in Tom Jones.|$|E

5|$|St Mary's {{is built}} of ashlar buff and red {{sandstone}} quarried locally at Alderley Edge, and {{the roof is}} of Kerridge stone slates. Its plan consists of a tower at the west end, a four-bay nave with north and south aisles, a chancel with a vestry to its north, and a south porch. Over the north aisle is a dormer window. The tower has diagonal buttresses. Its west door has 14th-century mouldings and above the door is a three-light window. The stage above this contains ringers' windows on {{the north and west}} faces and a diamond-shaped <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> south face. Above these the belfry windows on all faces have two lights. The top of the tower is embattled and contains the bases of eight pinnacles. Below the parapet is a string course with large grotesque gargoyles. At the west end of the nave roof is a bellcote. The Stanley pew projects to the east of the south porch. In the porch are grooves which were cut where arrows were sharpened.|$|E

50|$|In early 1982, each of {{the four}} of <b>the</b> <b>clocks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tower had been {{displaying}} different times. The University commissioned Pat Boyden (UVM class of 1967) to rebuild the clock mechanism and replace the clock hands with a lighter aluminum material. Boyden further donated new hour and minute markings for the clocks.|$|R

25|$|The Saints {{beat the}} Eagles 26–24 in the Saturday night game. It was the Saints' first ever road playoff victory.

However, the Saints worked their way down the field while also working the <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> game's final drive before Shayne Graham kicked the game-winning field goal from 32 yards out as time expired.|$|E
50|$|Originally, a {{provision}} {{was made on}} all four sides of Leighton church tower for square clock faces set lozenge-style, recalling similar <b>clocks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> St Gregory Tower at St Paul's and the western turret at Covent Garden (neither of which are still in existence). There are additional similarities {{in the design of}} the west tower to these two churches, in particular the parallel windows of the ringing chamber, though there is no evidence to suggest that there was any formal connection. However, as built, the west tower has a single <b>clock</b> face <b>on</b> <b>the</b> west face of the tower.|$|R

25|$|Notre Dame won a {{turnover}} filled game, 13–6. After a scoreless first quarter, Notre Dame {{opened the}} scoring with a 33-yard field goal from Kyle Brindza {{and added to}} its lead before halftime via a two-yard touchdown run from Tommy Rees. Notre Dame led 10–0 at halftime. After a scoreless third quarter, Michigan scored its first points of the game via a 33-yard field goal from Brendan Gibbons. Notre Dame responded with a 39-yard field goal from Kyle Brindza, but Michigan added another field goal—a 31-yard kick from Gibbons—to cut the lead to seven. Notre Dame was able to run out the <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ensuing drive, ending the game and ending a three-game losing streak to Michigan.|$|E
25|$|The match {{began with}} a goal after just 20 seconds, scored by Jakub Klepiš from a pass by Jaromír Jágr. The goal was {{seemingly}} {{the result of a}} defensive mistake which led to a Czech offensive possession with Russian defensemen out of position. For the remainder of the period the Russians held almost complete possession of the puck, and veteran Sergei Fedorov hit the post after an odd man rush. Very late in the period the Russians put the puck in the net on a power play, but it was determined to be after the clock had run out and was ruled as no goal. There was some brief confusion however, as the buzzer sounds after the <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scoreboard runs out.|$|E
