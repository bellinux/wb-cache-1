5|$|Because {{there is}} a {{temperature}} difference between the core and the surface, or photosphere, energy is transported outward. The two modes for transporting this energy are radiation and <b>convection.</b> A radiation zone, where energy is transported by radiation, is stable against <b>convection</b> and {{there is very little}} mixing of the plasma. By contrast, in a <b>convection</b> zone the energy is transported by bulk movement of plasma, with hotter material rising and cooler material descending. <b>Convection</b> is a more efficient mode for carrying energy than radiation, but it will only occur under conditions that create a steep temperature gradient.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{continuing}} {{effects from}} the strong wind shear, a large, deep burst of <b>convection</b> formed in the northern semicircle of Josephine.

Sakurai et al. (2011) showed convergence between near surface easterly wind from dissipating local convective cells along the southwestern coastline of Sumatera Island and ambient southerly wind over the Indian Ocean, and this resulted in the successive generation of convective cells at the leading edge of precipitating systems that drove their offshore migration according to a case study of dual-Doppler radar observations. In addition, Mori et al. (2011) suggested that a seeder-feeder mechanism acts between leading-edges of westward spreading anvil clouds formed by local <b>convections</b> and eastward propagating large-scale MJO <b>convections,</b> which contributes to the offshore migration and re-development of the precipitating systems over the same region. On the contrary, Yokoi et al. (2017) recently studied radar and intensive sounding data obtained during the pre-YMC 2015 campaign conducted around Bengkulu (3.86 ° S, 102.33 ° E) on the southwestern coastline of Sumatera and found that shallow gravity waves generated by initial <b>convections</b> over the mountain foothill region in the daytime drove the <b>convections</b> toward the offshore in the late evening. Meanwhile, Wu et al. (2008) showed that the land-breeze (gravity current) circulation played an essential role in the nocturnal offshore migration of rainfall over Kalimantan/Borneo Island, and such events were mainly formed by evaporation cooling after rainfall in the evening over the island plain as well as nocturnal radiative cooling based on both satellite observations and numerical model simulations. Moreover, Ichikawa and Yasunari (2008) concluded that orography induced local circulation (i.e., mountain–valley breeze) and its interaction with large-scale monsoon winds were key factors for rainfall offshore propagation over New Guinea Island in addition to both land–sea breeze circulation and gravity waves.|$|R

As shown in Figure  1, the observational site is situated in the Brahmaputra valley with 4 - to 5 -km-high mountains about towards the north and south. Barros et al. (2004) have shown that high mountains of Himalaya interact with prevailing winds in monsoon season and can produce deep <b>convections</b> over that region at late night hours. They have also suggested that the radiative cooling at high mountaintops can generate moisture conversions at the foothills and they may be responsible for deep midnight <b>convections</b> over that region. Our observations also suggest that moisture conversion at foothills due to radiative cooling at mountaintops during nighttime may be responsible for triggering of such deep <b>convections</b> over Guwahati during the pre-monsoon season.|$|R

An area of <b>convection</b> along the wave tracked westward {{to the south of}} Central America and Mexico, and became more concentrated on November 12 while located about 400miles (645km) south of Acapulco. Later that day, Dvorak classification began on the disturbance, and the <b>convection</b> continued to organize. Early on November 13, the National Hurricane Center indicated the possibility of the system developing into a tropical depression. Thunderstorm activity briefly decreased, though late on November 13 the system acquired enough circulation and organized <b>convection</b> for it to be designated Tropical Depression Twenty-One-E while located about 460miles (740km) south of Manzanillo, Mexico.

The <b>convection</b> quickly diminished and mainly consisted of only sporadically bursts of shower and thunderstorm activity. Little change in organization took place as the disturbance tracked through the Bahamas on September11 and September12. However, the disturbance quickly organized and developed more thunderstorm activity while approaching Florida. A tropical depression is estimated to have formed at 06:00UTC on September13, around the time it was making landfall in Jensen Beach, Florida. Within a few hours, a strong band of deep <b>convection</b> formed in the northeast quadrant of the cyclone, though westerly wind shear prevented any significant <b>convection</b> from developing on the western side of the storm.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August8, which subsequently tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean with minimal <b>convection.</b> The wave crossed into the eastern Pacific Ocean on August16, at which time <b>convection</b> increased along the wave axis. Three days later, a weak low pressure area formed along the wave, and early on August20 some broad cyclonic turning was evident within the cloud pattern. Gradually, banding features developed around the area of deep <b>convection,</b> and the system was expect to develop further as it moved into an increasingly favorable environment. <b>Convection</b> increased late on August20, although it initially remained disorganized; however, the thunderstorms consolidated near the low, and it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression by 1200UTC on August21, about 350mi (560km) south-southwest of Acapulco, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave moved westward off {{the coast}} of Africa on July 27. Initially, virgorous <b>convection</b> persisted throughout the wave axis, though dry air greatly diminished the <b>convection</b> on July 28. The wind field remained well-defined as it continued westward, and deep <b>convection</b> increased two days later along the northern end of the wave axis. Dvorak classifications began on July 30 in response to an increase in vertical depth and organization of the <b>convection.</b> On July 31 a buoy recorded a change of wind direction from northeast to west, indicating a small low pressure area formed. Convective organization rapidly increased as it turned to the northwest, and the system developed into Tropical Depression Three on August 1 while located about 235miles (375km) east-southeast of Barbuda.|$|E
5|$|After a {{subtropical}} depression {{exited the}} Mozambique Channel, {{another area of}} <b>convection</b> formed in the region on January8, which fluctuated in intensity for several days.

Two days later, a subtropical disturbance formed offshore Beira, Mozambique, classified due to the extratropical origins and lack of centralized <b>convection.</b> The system remained nearly stationary, with the <b>convection</b> extending well to the east. On January16, the MFR reclassified {{the system as a}} tropical depression after the thunderstorms increased near the center, the increasing organization due to moderate but decreasing wind shear. By that time, the depression had begun an eastward movement, but soon turned to the south in the weakness between two high-pressure areas. Late on January16, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Alda after the <b>convection</b> organized into a central dense overcast.

5|$|After {{turning back}} to the northwest, the <b>convection</b> around Linfa became even more symmetrical, {{although}} the circulation became slightly elongated. At 06:00UTC on July4, the storm reached a preliminary peak intensity, with 10minute sustained winds of 85km/h (50mph) according to the JMA. As Linfa neared the northern Philippines, the bulk of the <b>convection</b> was shifted to the southern periphery, due to the continued wind shear. Late on July4, the center of Linfa made landfall over Palanan, Isabela, on the island of Luzon. Moving westward across the island, the circulation became disorganized as the core <b>convection</b> diminished. By late on July5, Linfa emerged into the South China Sea. Once over open waters, Linfa began moving to the north-northwest, still moving around the subtropical ridge, and it was expected to move over Taiwan. The circulation remained well-defined but exposed, with the deep <b>convection</b> displaced to the south. With the isolated thunderstorms and unfavorable wind shear, the JTWC noted the potential for the circulation to dissipate over open waters. By July7, easing wind shear allowed the <b>convection</b> to rebuild and for the structure to improve in organization. By that time, the future of the storm was still uncertain, although a turn to the northwest toward China was expected. Also on July7, PAGASA issued its final bulletin on the storm as Linfa exited their area of responsibility.|$|E
5|$|An upper-level {{anticyclone}} {{north of}} the system provided a more favorable environment for organization, allowing the <b>convection</b> to organize into banding features. The system also developed good outflow, though initially the surface circulation was too elongated {{for it to be}} considered a tropical cyclone. Early on June3, the nearby anticyclone moved northeastward, which increased wind shear over the system and caused it briefly to become less-organized. However, <b>convection</b> increased over the center, and at 1500UTC on June3 the NHC classified the system as Tropical Depression Two-E about 140mi (240km) southwest of Zihuatanejo, Guerrero; the upgrade was due to the system developing sufficiently organized <b>convection,</b> as well as a closed surface circulation.|$|E

The strengthening followed {{the passage of a}} shortwave trough; however, shear over the system remained strong. Despite the unfavorable conditions, Zeke maintained its intensity, through intermittent bursts of <b>convection,</b> and began to turn towards the northeast. Late on October29, a large burst of deep <b>convection</b> over the center of the storm allowed for intensification.

40|$|The aerosol–cloud {{interaction}} {{over the}} Tibetan Plateau {{has been investigated}} using a cloud-resolving weather research and forecasting model with a two-moment bulk microphysical scheme including aerosol effects on cloud condensation nuclei and ice nuclei. Two types of cumulus clouds with a similar convective available potential energy, occurring over the Tibetan Plateau (Cu-TP) and North China Plain (Cu-NCP) in August  2014, are simulated to explore the response of convective clouds to aerosols. A set of aerosol profiles {{is used in the}} simulations, with the surface aerosol number concentration varying from 20  to 9000  cm − 3 and the sulfate mass concentration varying from 0. 02  to 9. 0  µg cm − 3. Increasing aerosol concentrations generally enhances the cloud core updraft and maximum updraft, intensifying <b>convections</b> in Cu-TP and Cu-NCP. However, the core updraft is much stronger in Cu-TP than Cu-NCP, because of the early occurrence of the glaciation process in Cu-TP that is triggered at an elevation above 4000  m. The precipitation increases steadily with aerosol concentrations in Cu-NCP, caused by the suppression of the warm rain but occurrence of efficient mix-phased precipitation due to the reduced cloud droplet size. The precipitation in Cu-TP also increases with aerosol concentrations, but the precipitation enhancement is not substantial compared to that in Cu-NCP with high aerosol concentrations. The aerosol-induced intensification of <b>convections</b> in Cu-TP not only facilitates the precipitation but also transports more ice-phase hydrometeors into the upper troposphere to decrease the precipitation efficiency. Considering the very clean atmosphere over the Tibetan Plateau, elevated aerosol concentrations can remarkably enhance <b>convections</b> due to its specific topography, which not only warms the middle troposphere to influence the Asian summer monsoon but also delivers hydrometeors into the upper troposphere to allow more water vapor to travel into the lower stratosphere...|$|R

Deep <b>convection</b> became very concentric around the 11.5mile (18.5km) wide eye, and the hurricane reached winds of 125mph (205km/h) early on August 31. At this time, the deepest <b>convection</b> near the eye degraded in appearance, and Fabian temporarily stopped its strengthening trend. Later that day, the eye became distinct again within a perfectly round area of deep <b>convection.</b> Outflow continued to expand in all directions, and Fabian intensified into a Category 4 hurricane late on August 31. Thunderstorm activity near the eyewall became more intense, and the cloud tops in the eyewall became much cooler; simultaneously, outflow away from the eye became much more symmetrical, both signs of an intensifying tropical cyclone.

The three-dimensional conceptual models associated with this case were constructed in order to realize the possible mechanisms for triggering boundary layer <b>convections.</b> The preliminary results show: (1) The Mei-yu frontal systems were quite shallow (less than 1. 5 km in altitude) and possessed strong vertical wind shear (more than 14 ms- 1 km- 1). The boundary layer <b>convections</b> associated with the shallow fronts could be triggered by the instability of the frontal system and the abundant supply of warm, moist air related to the southwesterly flow. (2) The southwesterly low level jet (LLJ) obviously occurred at altitude between 0. 5 km and 1. 5 km in intensity of more than 10 m/s in use of high spatial and temporal resolution radar data. The existence of LLJ couldn’t be detected by the routine rawinsonde observations and was resulted from the strong pressure gradient force due to the high and low pressure distributions over the Taiwan Island which could be clearly delineated by the surface subjective analysis based on the hourly observation data. (3) The convective cells embedded in the frontal systems could be well organized into convective turbulences due to the following key factors. The first key factor was the confluent effect, which was resulted from the mergence of southwesterly, westerly and/or northwesterly flows and accumulated sufficient air mass and momentum at a specified region. The second one was the local cyclonic motion that made the convective cells well organized and triggered more precipitation over ground.
