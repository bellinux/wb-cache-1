40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the issue of operating frame saws, maintenance and usage of saw blades. In the introductory part, historic development and improvement of frame saws in the Czech Republic and abroadis gradually dismantled. The second part focuses on the theoretical analysis of the process of <b>cutting</b> <b>frame</b> saws. Next part deals with technical - technological characteristics of frame saws. The cutting mechanism and also the usage of the machineis described there. Next part is focused on categorization of <b>cutting</b> <b>frame</b> saws according to a frame diameter and from the kinematic point of view. The next section describes the methods of division by frame saws, as well as {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the machines. The following section focuses on the cutting tool of frame saws, its definition and characteristics. In this section, a saw blades, its distribution, shape and geometry are described. The final part deals with maintenance of saw blades, compensation and removal of local defects of internal stress, subsequent control of internal tensions, as well as distributing of the blades. Further more, this part deals with grinding wheels for sharpening of saw blades and mistakes that occurduring the sharpening of the saws...|$|E

This paper further explores embodied constructions for verbal patterns in interactional settings (Schoonjans 2014, a. o.). More specifically this paper examines the complementarity of generic verb patterns (like do, make, …) and the manual specification for instrumental roles (tools used in the action) and patients (objects undergoing the action). Previous research showed that schematic instrument nouns or generic verbal predicates for instruments typically co-occur more frequently with gesture than in specific predicates (82 % vs. 59 % respectively). The video corpus {{used in the study}} is composed of elicited dyadic interactions (10 pairs of participants, all native speakers of Dutch). The design of these interactions is centered around the opposition between the instrumental actions of cutting and breaking, taken from work in cross-linguistic verb typology (Bowerman & Brown 2008, Bohnemeyer 2007, Majid et al. 2007). The participants were instructed to describe static images showing objects and instruments in terms of potential actions and their results. In their verbalization of these instrumental actions the participants spontaneously produced (co-speech) gesture. We examine the co-speech elaboration of generic cutting verbs, as it appears in specific hand shapes and movements used as non-verbal and dynamic markers for enacting typical instrument and patient roles, transitivity, manner of motion, and markers for the cause-effect relation. We build a co-speech typology for static entities and processes in the <b>cutting</b> <b>frame.</b> The analysis furthermore reveals the existence of two types of two verbal distributional patterns: (1) gestural completion of an unfinished l utterance: the non-verbalized part, i. e. the empty slots in the instrumental frame of the utterance -pertaining either to the instrument or the instrumental action- are subsequently realized in gesture by a single speaker; (2) co-construction involving different speakers in a similar process of complementation across modes. Gestural co-specification, completion and co-construction add evidence to the growing body of research on the embodied nature of grammatical constructions, calling for a descriptive approach which does justice to semiosis as a visual and gestural phenomenon in interaction.

The wood and iron were both exported to England. The sawmill burned down in 1890 but was quickly rebuilt. However, iron production had been phased out by 1896. The 3 July 1908 fire occurred during a slump, and the owners chose not to rebuild. Almost 600 people were left homeless.|$|R

50|$|J.S. O'Connor American Rich Cut Glassware Factory, {{also known}} as Maple City Glass Company, H.W. Kimble Silk Company, and Arrow Throwing Company, is a {{historic}} glassware factory and silk mill located at Hawley, Wayne County, Pennsylvania. With the waning of the canal and gravity rail operations in the late 19th Century, Hawley developed into a busy manufacturing town. In addition to silk fabric and garments, among the chief products was fine cut glass. The leading cut glass establishment was that of John Sarsfield O’Connor (1831 - 1916) {{at the base of}} the Paupack Falls. The building was built on the site of previous mills of wood frame construction in 1890. The earliest of these dates back to the founding of the hamlet of Paupack Eddy, the forerunner of Hawley, in the closing decade of the 18th Century. It is a three-story, 160 feet long and 44 feet wide, bluestone building in the Federal style, with an addition 40 by 75 feet. J.S. O’Connor Rich Cut Glass has been described as one of the most extensive glass cutting factories in America. O’Connor is recalled as one of the finest glass cutters in the nation.The factory was said to be one of its kind in America, run by water power and lit by electricity generated by its own electrical plant. The firm had a capacity of 250 <b>cutting</b> <b>frames.</b> When the third floor was rebuilt, 50 <b>cutting</b> <b>frames</b> were added.This brought the workforce from 150 to nearly 200, and a new showroom was built. Another reference says that the workforce eventually reached almost 300. In 1902, the cut glass firm relocated from Hawley to Goshen, Orange County, NY. On January 16th of that year, J. S. O’Connor sold his Hawley plant. The addition was built in 1926, when the building was converted to a silk throwing mill. In 1941 Daniel Vacca Sr, purchased the silk mill. Vacca & Sons operated the Arrow Throwing Company at the facility. During World War II, the Vaccas were a major supplier of yarn for emblems and insignias as well as nylon cord for parachutes. Arrow Throwing Company, the last remaining silk mill in Hawley and one of the few throwing mills left in the Northeast, closed its doors in 1987. Soon a lobby was added to the building by new owners in 1988, when converted to an inn, and a restaurant was added years later. It has a shed roof and features pedimented windows and a decorative cornice.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how {{the representation of}} architectural space was radically repositioned {{in a number of}} creative art practices of the 1920 s. The creative strategies of flattening, <b>cutting,</b> <b>framing</b> and transparency implicate architecture, not only eroding the spatial certainties of figure and ground but the techniques of architectural representation that were used to describe them. These practices were intrinsically related to the "transgressive" avant-gardes of Dada and Surrealism and exist {{as part of a broader}} project to dismantle the boundaries between artistic mediums and, in the process, undermine the subjective nature of architectural experience. Through these projects, and the contemporaneous interest in ethnography, space was freed from its passive, contextual relationship to art and reconceptualized as an "artefact": a fixed, flattened object that could be positioned in time and verified through aesthetic experience. This paper focusses on the works of three artists: Francis Picabia, Alberto Giacometti and Max Ernst. It demonstrates the way in which each artist undertook works that specifically and deliberately questioned the nature of architectural space and its relationship to the art object. These radical approaches blurred the well-established architectural categories of context and object, figure and ground, and were instrumental in avant-garde strategies of making architecture from the 1970 s to the present...|$|R

30|$|One of {{the other}} criticisms of {{lengthening}} is the psychologic impact on the child. Although lengthening is undisputedly stressful for {{the child and the}} family, two recent {{studies have shown that the}} majority of problems are transitory and remit with appropriate treatment [52, 53] and that the lengthening treatment does not cause long-term psychologic maladjustment [53]. Although most patients tolerate the lengthening process well, some patients do develop loss of appetite, weight loss and difficulty sleeping. A single small dose of amitriptyline before bedtime is useful in helping these patients. Lengthening should not be an excruciatingly painful experience. If a patient is complaining of a lot of pain, especially during the day while at rest, the cause of the pain should be sought. Pain may be related to pin infection, pin loosening or <b>cutting</b> out, <b>frame</b> instability, nerve entrapment/stretch, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, rupture of the regenerating bone after premature consolidation, among other causes. Appropriate treatment, such as antibiotics, pin removal, wire retensioning, slowing distraction, pin replacement and backing up of the distraction, should be administered as soon as the problem is recognized. Peroneal nerve release should be considered if evidence of peroneal nerve stretch does not respond to slowing distraction.|$|R
