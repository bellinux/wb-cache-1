For instance, {{a large part of}} the public budget is destined to solve social and health problems, such as public sanitation. Government has attacked the problem by providing public sanitation infrastructure (such as garbage and recycling receptacles) and by using social ad campaigns. However, these efforts do not always affect the habits of residents and bring the desired changes in city sanitation. This article presents a case study that used a participatory method to address an innovative city sanitation effort: The <b>Clean</b> <b>City</b> <b>Program</b> in Puebla, Mexico. This program adopted social marketing techniques, a discipline born in the 70 s when the principles and practices developed to sell products and services started to be applied to sell ideas, attitudes, or behaviors. Social marketing programs have been adopted by governments to change attitudes and behavior in areas such as public services. The article first describes the context and strategies of the program, which included the use of the promotora model to engage community members. The researchers then make use of qualitative data gathered throughout program planning and implementation to evaluate the impact of the social marketing programs and its effectiveness. The article analyzes social, educational, economic, demographic, and cultural factors that influence the effectiveness of sanitation programs and presents recommendations for strategies to engage community members in community sanitation programs...|$|R

40|$|<b>Clean</b> <b>Cities</b> is a government-industry {{partnership}} {{sponsored by}} the U. S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Vehicle Technologies Program, {{which is part of}} the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. Working with its network of about 100 local coalitions and more than 6, 500 stakeholders across the country, <b>Clean</b> <b>Cities</b> delivers on its mission to reduce petroleum consumption in on-road transportation. In its work to reduce petroleum use, <b>Clean</b> <b>Cities</b> focuses on a portfolio of technologies that includes electric drive, propane, natural gas, renewable natural gas/biomethane, ethanol/E 85, biodiesel/B 20 and higher-level blends, fuel economy, and idle reduction. Over the past 17 years, <b>Clean</b> <b>Cities</b> coalitions have displaced more than 2. 4 billion gallons of petroleum; they are on track to displace 2. 5 billion gallons of gasoline per year by 2020. This <b>Clean</b> <b>Cities</b> Strategic Plan lays out an aggressive five-year agenda to help DOE <b>Clean</b> <b>Cities</b> and its network of coalitions and stakeholders accelerate the deployment of alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles, while also expanding the supporting infrastructure to reduce petroleum use. Today, <b>Clean</b> <b>Cities</b> has a far larger opportunity to make an impact than at any time in its history because of its unprecedented $ 300 million allocation for community-based deployment projects from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) (see box below). Moreover, the <b>Clean</b> <b>Cities</b> annual budget has risen to $ 25 million for FY 2010 and $ 35 million has been requested for FY 2011. Designed as a living document, this strategic plan is grounded in the understanding that priorities will change annually as evolving technical, political, economic, business, and social considerations are woven into project decisions and funding allocations. The plan does not intend to lock <b>Clean</b> <b>Cities</b> into pathways that cannot change. Instead, with technology deployment at its core, the plan serves as a guide for decision-making at both the national and local levels of <b>Clean</b> <b>Cities</b> over the next five years. The plan recognizes the need for flexibility and sets out a strategic direction that will build on the progress of current technologies and new opportunities presented in emerging fuels and technologies, such as hydrogen and fuel cells, as well as new niche markets such as off-road applications that build additional throughput at existing alternative fuel stations...|$|R
40|$|Philadelphia’s Green <b>City</b> <b>Clean</b> Waters <b>program</b> is an {{innovative}} plan {{to reduce the}} frequency and environmental impact of combined sewer overflows through massive, citywide implementation of green infrastructure practices. The program has been approved by regulatory agencies {{based on the assumption}} that a variety of direct benefits and co-benefits will be realized over a 25 -year period. We report research on methodology for developing green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) benefit functions that express direct runoff reduction benefits and ancillary co-benefits of GSI as functions of investment levels. Functions for direct benefits are generated by coupling a multiobjective evolutionary optimization algorithm (MOEA) to a hydrologic simulation model. Functions for co-benefits are developed through community-based participatory research enabling prioritization of benefits and GSI implementation strategies that reflect the values of the communities that are served. Benefit functions are used in the StormWISE multiobjective decision support framework to optimize GSI investments at the subwatershed level. Read More: [URL]...|$|R

40|$|This guide {{provides}} the basic concepts {{to aid in}} an alternative fuel vehicle market development program developing an application for Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program funding. The US Department of Energy`s <b>Clean</b> <b>Cities</b> <b>Program</b> is an aggressive, forward-thinking alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) market development program. The stakeholders in any <b>Clean</b> <b>Cities</b> <b>Program</b> subscribe to the common philosophy that, through participation in a team-oriented coalition, steady progress can be made toward achieving the critical mass necessary to propel the AFV market into the next century. An important component in the successful implementation of <b>Clean</b> <b>Cities</b> <b>Program</b> objectives is obtaining and directing funding to the capital-intensive AFV market development outside of the resources currently offered by the Department of Energy. Several state and local funding sources have been used over the past decade, including Petroleum Violation Escrow funds, vehicle registration fees, and state bond programs. However, federal funding is available and can be tapped to implement AFV market development programs across the nation. Historically, opportunities to use federal funding for AFV projects have been limited; however, the one remaining federal program that must be tapped into by Clean Cities Programs is the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) Improvement Program. CMAQ is a 6 -year, $ 6 billion federal program formed by the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) ...|$|E

The plan's success, therefore, is highly dependent on behavior change. This plan was derived largely from a review of the actions taken and behavior changes made by companies and commuters throughout the United States in response to the oil price spike of 2008.
