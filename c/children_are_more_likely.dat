Sixty-two families with an obese child (aged four to 11 years) were matched with 62 families with a healthy weight child on key sociodemographic variables. Significant differences were found on several measures, including general parenting style, domain-specific parenting practices, and parenting self-efficacy (d =. 53 to 1. 96). Parents of obese <b>children</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to use permissive and coercive discipline techniques, and to lack confidence in managing children’s lifestyle behaviour.

25|$|The {{understanding}} of friendship in children {{tends to be}} more heavily focused on areas such as common activities, physical proximity, and shared expectations. These friendships provide opportunity for playing and practicing self-regulation. Most children tend to describe friendship in terms of things like sharing, and <b>children</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to share with someone they consider to be a friend. As children mature, they become less individualized and are more aware of others. They gain the ability to empathize with their friends, and enjoy playing in groups. They also experience peer rejection as they move through the middle childhood years. Establishing good friendships at a young age helps a child to be better acclimated in society later on in their life.|$|E
25|$|Māori suffer more health problems, {{including}} {{higher levels}} of alcohol and drug abuse, smoking and obesity. Less frequent use of healthcare services mean that late diagnosis and treatment intervention lead to {{higher levels of}} morbidity and mortality in many manageable conditions, such as cervical cancer, diabetes per head of population than non-Māori. Although Māori life expectancy rates have increased dramatically in the last 50 years, they still have considerably lower life-expectancies compared to New Zealanders of European ancestry: in 2004, Māori males lived 69.0 years vs. non-Māori males 77.2 years; Māori females 73.2 yrs vs. non-Māori females 81.9 years. This gap had narrowed by 2013: 72.8 years for men and 76.5 years for women, compared to 80.2 years for non-Māori men and 83.7 years for non-Māori women. Also, {{a recent study by the}} New Zealand Family Violence Clearinghouse showed that Māori women and <b>children</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to experience domestic violence than any other ethnic group.|$|E
25|$|Children's {{food choices}} are also {{influenced}} by family meals. Researchers provided a household eating questionnaire to 18,177 children, ranging in ages 11–21, and discovered that {{four out of five}} parents let their children make their own food decisions. They also discovered that compared to adolescents who ate three or fewer meals per week, those who ate four to five family meals per week were 19% less likely to report poor consumption of vegetables, 22% less likely to report poor consumption of fruits, and 19% less likely to report poor consumption of dairy foods. Adolescents who ate six to seven family meals per week, compared to those who ate three or fewer family meals per week, were 38% less likely to report poor consumption of vegetables, 31% less likely to report poor consumption of fruits, and 27% less likely to report poor consumption of dairy foods. The results of a survey in the UK published in 2010 imply that children raised by their grandparents {{are more likely to be}} obese as adults than those raised by their parents.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{explored}} whether {{differences in}} environmental lead exposures explain the racial disparity in children's blood lead levels. METHODS: Environmental {{sources of lead}} were identified for {{a random sample of}} 172 urban children. RESULTS: Blood lead levels were significantly higher among Black children. Lead-contamination of dust was higher in Black children's homes, and the condition of floors and interior paint was generally poorer. White <b>children</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to put soil in their mouths and to suck their fingers, whereas Black <b>children</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to put their mouths on window sills and to use a bottle.

25|$|Families tend to {{seek out}} schools whose {{principal}} languages they share, and ideally one which mirrors their own educational system. Many countries have American schools, French schools, British schools, German Schools and 'International Schools' which often follow {{one of the three}} International Baccalaureate programs. These will be populated by expatriates' children and some children of the local upper middle class. They do this in an effort to maintain linguistic stability and to ensure that their children do not fall behind due to linguistic problems. Where their own language is not available, families will often choose English-speaking schools for their children. They do this because of the linguistic and cultural opportunities being immersed in English might provide their children when they are adults, and because their <b>children</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to have prior exposure to English than to other international languages. This poses the potential for non-English speaking TCKs to have a significantly different experience from TCKs for whom English is a native language. Research on TCKs from Japan, Denmark, Italy, Germany, the United States and Africa has shown that TCKs from different countries share more in common with other TCKs than they do with their own peer group from their passport country.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{assessed}} {{the role of}} age, racial/ethnic group, and gender, {{as well as that}} of other sociocultural variables, in minors' access to tobacco. METHODS: Thirty-six minors attempted to purchase cigarettes once in each of 72 stores (2592 purchase attempts). The minors represented equal numbers of girls and boys; 10 -year-olds, 14 -year-olds, and 16 -year-olds; and Whites, Blacks, and Latinos. Equal numbers of stores were in Black, White, and Latino neighborhoods. RESULTS: Older <b>children</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than younger ones to be sold cigarettes, and Latino <b>children</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than Whites to be sold cigarettes. Older Black children (irrespective of gender) were the single most likely group to be sold cigarettes.

40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comObjectives: To explore factors contributing to dental service use and toothbrushing among Mäori, Pacific and New Zealand European or Other (NZEO) children in New Zealand. Methods: Data {{were obtained from the}} 2002 National Child Nutrition Survey. Models representing demographic, socio-economic status (SES), lifestyle, dietary, food security and oral health paradigms were tested using logistic regression. Results: Mäori and Pacific <b>children</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to not attend for dental care (OR: 1. 99 and 2. 05 respectively) than NZEO children when age, sex and time lived in New Zealand were accounted for. The addition of household (OR: 1. 93 and 2. 05 respectively) or lifestyle (OR: 1. 95 and 1. 81 respectively) factors resulted in minimal OR changes for Mäori or Pacific child dental attendance, whereas addition of dietary (OR: 1. 44 and 1. 23 respectively) and food security (OR: 1. 43 and 1. 32 respectively) items reduced the ORs of Mäori and Pacific child dental attendance so they no longer differed significantly to NZEO children. Addition of dental factors increased the ORs of Mäori and Pacific children not utilizing dental services compared with NZEO children (OR: 2. 30 and 2. 13 respectively). Mäori and Pacific <b>children</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to not brush teeth (OR: 3. 86 and 1. 49 respectively) than NZEO children when age, sex and time lived in New Zealand were accounted for. Addition of dietary factors resulted in a 36 % OR reduction of Mäori children not brushing (OR: 2. 57), while addition of household SES (OR: 1. 06), lifestyle (OR: 1. 14), dietary (OR: 0. 71) or food security factors (OR: 1. 19) reduced the ORs of Pacific <b>children</b> so they <b>were</b> no longer significantly different to NZEO children. Conclusions: Mäori and Pacific <b>children</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to have not received dental care (variance largely explained by dietary and food security factors) and Mäori <b>children</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to not brush their teeth (variance largely explained by dietary items) than NZEO children.
