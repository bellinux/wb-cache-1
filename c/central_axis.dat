5|$|The Forbidden City remains {{important}} in the civic scheme of Beijing. The central north–south axis remains the <b>central</b> <b>axis</b> of Beijing. This axis extends to the south through Tiananmen gate to Tiananmen Square, the ceremonial centre of the People's Republic of China, and on to Yongdingmen. To the north, it extends through Jingshan Hill to the Bell and Drum Towers. This axis is not exactly aligned north–south, but is tilted by slightly more than two degrees. Researchers now believe that the axis was designed in the Yuan dynasty to be aligned with Xanadu, the other capital of their empire.|$|E
5|$|The Meridian Gate has two {{protruding}} wings forming {{three sides}} of a square (Wumen, or Meridian Gate, Square) before it. The gate has five gateways. The central gateway {{is part of the}} Imperial Way, a stone flagged path that forms the <b>central</b> <b>axis</b> of the Forbidden City and the ancient city of Beijing itself, and leads {{all the way from the}} Gate of China in the south to Jingshan in the north. Only the Emperor may walk or ride on the Imperial Way, except for the Empress on the occasion of her wedding, and successful students after the Imperial Examination.|$|E
5|$|A {{visually}} striking {{effect is}} seen every March and September as an unusual shadow occurs around the equinoxes. A shadow appears to descend the west balustrade {{of the northern}} stairway. The visual effect is of a serpent descending the stairway, with its head at the base in light. Additionally the western face points to sunset around 25 May, traditionally the date of transition from the dry to the rainy season. The intended alignment was, however, likely incorporated in the northern (main) facade of the temple, as it corresponds to sunsets on May 20 and July 24, recorded also by the <b>central</b> <b>axis</b> of Castillo at Tulum.. The two dates are separated by 65 and 300 days, {{and it has been}} shown that the solar orientations in Mesoamerica regularly correspond to dates separated by calendrically significant intervals (multiples of 13 and 20 days).|$|E

5|$|At {{the base}} of the {{bacterial}} flagellum, where it enters the cell membrane, a motor protein acts as a rotary engine. The engine is powered by proton motive force, i.e. by the flow of protons (hydrogen ions) across the bacterial cell membrane due to a concentration gradient set up by the cell's metabolism. (In species of the genus Vibrio, {{there are two kinds of}} flagella, lateral and polar, and some are driven by a sodium ion pump rather than a proton pump.) Flagella are quite efficient, allowing bacteria to move at speeds of up to 60cell lengths per second. The rotary motor at {{the base of}} the flagellum is similar in structure to ATP synthase. Spirillum bacteria have helical bodies with flagella at either end, and they spin about the <b>central</b> <b>axis</b> of their bodies as they move through the water.|$|E
5|$|Helical: These viruses are {{composed}} of a single type of capsomere stacked around a <b>central</b> <b>axis</b> to form a helical structure, which may have a central cavity, or tube. This arrangement results in rod-shaped or filamentous virions: These can be short and highly rigid, or long and very flexible. The genetic material, in general, single-stranded RNA, but ssDNA in some cases, is bound into the protein helix by interactions between the negatively charged nucleic acid and positive charges on the protein. Overall, {{the length of a}} helical capsid is related to the length of the nucleic acid contained within it and the diameter is dependent on the size and arrangement of capsomeres. The well-studied tobacco mosaic virus {{is an example of a}} helical virus.|$|E
5|$|Structure E4 is a {{platform}} located behind Pyramid E1 and encloses {{the eastern side}} of the Group E plaza. It faces west onto the plaza and has two access stairways, both flanked by ramps built from small slabs of stone and with cornices at the top. The platform walls are of fine workmanship, being built with well-cut and carefully fitted pumice. The front portion of the upper platform was paved with stone slabs, and a bench ran the entire length of the back of the platform. The clay floor between the paving and the bench was found to have been burnt. An offering was excavated from the <b>central</b> <b>axis</b> of the platform's base, it consisted of two ring-shaped clubs placed on either side of a stone ball.|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the clinical efficacy of posterior continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis(PCCC) combined with anterior vitrectomy in preventing posterior capsule opacification of congenital cataract surgery. METHODS: Postoperative clinical follow-up data of 82 cases(87 eyes) with congenital cataract treated in Eye Center of our hospital from January 2011 to August 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. The patients {{were divided into}} the surgical control group(38 cases, 40 eyes, recieved phacoemulsification + PCCC) and the study group(44 cases, 47 eyes, accepted phacoemulsification + PCCC + anterior vitrectomy). The incidence of <b>central</b> optic <b>axis</b> opaque and postoperative visual acuity distribution were recorded at 1 a follow-up. Intraoperative and postoperative complications were observed. RESULTS: The rate of <b>central</b> optic <b>axis</b> opaque grade 0 in control group was 37. 5 %, compared to 76. 6 % in study groups. The opacity distribution ratio of grade 1, 2, 3 and 4 in study group were {{lower than that of}} control group, and the <b>central</b> optic <b>axis</b> opacity distribution ratio in study group was significantly better than that of control group(P 0. 5 in control group was lower than the 40 eyes(85. 11 %) of that in study group.

40|$|Probe {{scanning}} {{is widely}} used in modern dental industry, {{which is why it}} is important for the scanning process to be accurate for both hardware and software. Due to the wide range of scanner manufacturers with different types of surface registration algorithms it is of interest to in an analytical way evaluate the successfulness of the scanning. If the surface is registered in a successful way it also increases the probability of fortunate re-engineering of the intended object based on the scanning. The rationale of the study is that a well represented scanning result is essential for the manufacturing, internal fit and strength of a coping. The purpose of this paper is to propose a general method that enables analysis of the successfulness of the representation of probe scanning, and an optimization of the scanning. Twenty-four scans of a premolar preparation die were made in order to demonstrate the cause and effect relationship between alignment, <b>central</b> revolution <b>axis</b> of the probe and the representation of the result. Three scans were made for each of 8 alignments of the die. First the <b>central</b> revolution <b>axis</b> of the scanner was set in the concavity between the 2 convexities of the die. In the second scan, the <b>central</b> revolution <b>axis</b> of the scanner was set slightly to the left of the higher convexity of the die. For the third scan, the <b>central</b> revolution <b>axis</b> was set on the maximum of the higher convexity. The fundamental idea of the method is that, by confining a triangulated surface representation, from the scan and the scanned object, to surfaces based on the probe tip geometry, a value for the accuracy of each triangle can be determined. When the position of the <b>central</b> revolution <b>axis</b> and the alignment were optimized the poor areas with a predefined tolerance between 0. 05 mm and 1. 25 mm than were reduced by a factor of 14. By optimizing scanning, better scan results can be achieved, which is desirable for the internal fit, strength and manufacturing of the coping...|$|R
5|$|In {{contrast}} with the rich ornamentation of the main building, the galleries in the Sainsbury Wing are pared-down and intimate, to suit the smaller scale {{of many of the}} paintings. The main inspirations for these rooms are Sir John Soane's toplit galleries for the Dulwich Picture Gallery and the church interiors of Filippo Brunelleschi (the stone dressing is in pietra serena, the grey stone local to Florence). The northernmost galleries align with Barry's <b>central</b> <b>axis,</b> so that there is a single vista down the whole length of the Gallery. This axis is exaggerated by the use of false perspective, as the columns flanking each opening gradually diminish in size until the visitor reaches the focal point (as of 2009), an altarpiece by Cima of The Incredulity of St Thomas. Venturi's postmodernist approach to architecture is in full evidence at the Sainsbury Wing, with its stylistic quotations from buildings as disparate as the clubhouses on Pall Mall, the Scala Regia in the Vatican, Victorian warehouses and Ancient Egyptian temples.|$|E
5|$|Built {{during the}} 13th and 14th centuries, the Palazzo Senatorio ("Senatorial Palace") stands atop the Tabularium, {{which had once}} housed the {{archives}} of ancient Rome. Peperino blocks from the Tabularium were re-used in {{the left side of}} the palace and a corner of the bell tower. It now houses the Roman city hall. Its double ramp of stairs was designed by Michelangelo. This double stairway to the palazzo replaced the old flight of steps and two-storied loggia, which had stood on the right side of the palace. The staircase cannot be seen solely in terms of the building to which it belongs but must be set in the context of the piazza as a whole. The steps, beginning at the center of each wing, move gently upward until they reach the inner corner, level off and recede to the main surface of the façade. They then continue an unbroken stateliness toward each other, converging on the central doorway of the second story. This interruption of the diagonal line and the brief inward change of direction both absorbs the <b>central</b> <b>axis</b> and links the two sides. The fountain in front of the staircase features the river gods of the Tiber and the Nile as well as Dea Roma (Minerva). The upper part of the facade was designed by Michelangelo with colossal corinthian pilasters harmonizing with the two other buildings. Its bell-tower was designed by Martino Longhi the Elder and built between 1578 and 1582. Its current facade was built by Giacomo della Porta and Girolamo Rainaldi.|$|E
5|$|Although Chang'an was {{the capital}} of the earlier Han and Jin dynasties, after {{subsequent}} destruction in warfare, it was the Sui dynasty model that comprised the Tang era capital. The roughly square dimensions of the city had six miles (10km) of outer walls running east to west, and more than five miles (8km) of outer walls running north to south. The royal palace, the Taiji Palace, stood north of the city's <b>central</b> <b>axis.</b> From the large Mingde Gates located mid-center of the main southern wall, a wide city avenue stretched from there all the way north to the central administrative city, behind which was the Chentian Gate of the royal palace, or Imperial City. Intersecting this were fourteen main streets running east to west, while eleven main streets ran north to south. These main intersecting roads formed 108 rectangular wards with walls and four gates each, and each ward filled with multiple city blocks. The city was made famous for this checkerboard pattern of main roads with walled and gated districts, its layout even mentioned in one of Du Fu's poems. During the Heian period, the city of Heian kyō (present-day Kyoto) of Japan like many cities was arranged in the checkerboard street grid pattern of the Tang capital and in accordance with traditional geomancy following the model of Chang'an. Of these 108 wards in Chang'an, two of them (each the size of two regular city wards) were designated as government-supervised markets, and other space reserved for temples, gardens, ponds, etc. Throughout the entire city, there were 111 Buddhist monasteries, 41 Daoist abbeys, 38 family shrines, 2 official temples, 7 churches of foreign religions, 10 city wards with provincial transmission offices, 12 major inns, and 6 graveyards. Some city wards were literally filled with open public playing fields or the backyards of lavish mansions for playing horse polo and cuju football. In 662, Emperor Gaozong moved the imperial court to the Daming Palace, which became the political center of the empire and served as the royal residence of the Tang emperors for more than 220 years.|$|E
