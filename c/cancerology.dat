50|$|Since microplasmas {{deactivate}} bacteria {{they may}} {{have the ability to}} destroy cancer cells. Jean Michel Pouvesle has been working at the University of Orléans in France, in the Group for Research and Studies on Mediators of Inflammation (GREMI), experimenting with the effects of microplasma on cancer cells. Pouvesle along with other scientists has created a dielectric barrier discharge and plasma gun for cancer treatment, in which microplasma will be applied to both in vitro and in vivo experiments. This application will reveal the role of ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species), DNA damage, cell cycle modification, and apoptosis induction. Studies show that microplasma treatments are able to induce programmed death (apoptosis) among cancer cells—stopping the rapid reproduction of cancerous cells, with little damage to living human tissues.GREMI performs many experiments with microplasmas in <b>cancerology,</b> their first experiment applies microplasma to mice tumors growing beneath the skin's surface. During this experiment, scientists found no changes or burns {{on the surface of the}} skin. After a five-day microplasma treatment, the results displayed a significant decrease in the growth of U87 glioma cancer (brain tumor), compared to the control group where microplasma was not applied. GREMI performed further in vitro studies regarding U87 gliomal cancer (brain tumors) and HCT116 (colon tumor) cell lines where microplasma was applied. This microplasma treatment was proven to be an efficient method in destroying cancer cells after being applied over periods of a few tens of seconds. Further studies are being conducted on the effects of microplasma treatment in oncology; this application of microplasma will impact the medical field significantly.|$|E

Background and aim: Mexico, as other countries, has recently changed regulatory requirements for non-innovator biopharmaceuticals (biocomparables); a suitable pharmacovigilance program being now mandatory.

Method: Prospective, phase IV, non-interventional study performed at the Instituto Nacional de Cancerología (National Institute of <b>Cancerology)</b> of Mexico. All pharmacy dispensations of filgrastim products were reviewed and recorded during four months. Patients received a diary for voluntary notation of adverse drug reactions (ADR) every time they were dispensed filgrastim.
