5|$|Brazil {{actively}} pursued ways {{to eliminate}} the threat from Rosas. In 1851, it allied with the Argentine breakaway provinces of Corrientes and Entre Rios (led by Justo José de Urquiza), and the anti-Rosas <b>Colorado</b> <b>party</b> in Uruguay. Brazil next secured the south-western flank by signing defensive alliances with Paraguay and Bolivia. Faced with an offensive alliance against his regime, Rosas declared war on Brazil.|$|E
5|$|The Oriental Republic of Uruguay in South America had been, {{since its}} {{independence}} in 1828, troubled by strife between the Blanco Party and the <b>Colorado</b> <b>Party.</b> They were not {{political parties in}} the modern sense, but factions that engaged in internecine rebellion whenever the other dominated the government. The nation was deeply divided into Colorado and Blanco camps. These partisan groups formed in the 1830s and arose out of patron–client relationships fostered by local caudillos in the cities and countryside. Rather than a unity based upon common nationalistic sentiments, each had differing aims and loyalties informed by their respective, insular political frameworks.|$|E
5|$|The Uruguayan War (10 August 1864– 20 February 1865) {{was fought}} between Uruguay's {{governing}} Blanco Party and an alliance {{consisting of the}} Empire of Brazil and the Uruguayan <b>Colorado</b> <b>Party,</b> covertly supported by Argentina. Since its independence, Uruguay had been ravaged by intermittent struggles between the Colorado and Blanco factions, each attempting to seize and maintain power in turn. The Colorado leader Venancio Flores launched the Liberating Crusade in 1863, an insurrection aimed at toppling Bernardo Berro, who presided over a Colorado–Blanco coalition (fusionist) government. Flores was aided by Argentina, whose president Bartolomé Mitre provided him with supplies, Argentine volunteers and river transport for troops.|$|E

25|$|The presidential {{election}} was won by opposition candidate Fernando Lugo of the Patriotic Alliance for Change, who defeated Blanca Ovelar of the long-ruling <b>Colorado</b> <b>Party.</b> The <b>Colorado</b> <b>Party</b> remained {{the largest in}} both houses of Congress despite losing several seats.|$|E
25|$|From 1870 to 1954, Paraguay {{was ruled}} by 44 {{different}} men, 24 {{of whom were}} forced from office in military coups. In 1954, General Alfredo Stroessner came to power {{and with the help}} of <b>Colorado</b> <b>Party</b> ruled until 1989.|$|E
25|$|The {{politics}} of the first post-war decade were heavily influenced by deeply personal conflicts between López loyalists and their more liberal opponents, but just as important was the backing of various politicians by Argentina and Brazil. In the end the Brazilian-supported politicians won, and established {{the rule of the}} <b>Colorado</b> <b>party.</b>|$|E

25|$|Another crisis ensued when Adolfo Chirife, a {{supporter}} of Schaerer, became a presidential candidate. Amassing {{the support of the}} <b>Colorado</b> <b>party</b> along with a large percentage of supporters in the Liberal Party, Chirife gathered enough support to ensure a victory in the upcoming elections. When Ayla reacted by blocking implementation of the elections, Schaerer's supporters attempted to restore the electoral process by force.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the {{rebellion}} in August 1948 the <b>Colorado</b> <b>Party,</b> which had been out of power since 1904, had almost total control in Paraguay. The fighting had simplified politics by eliminating all other parties and by reducing the size of the army. As 90% of the officer corps had joined the rebels, fewer individuals were now in a position to compete for power.|$|E
25|$|On April 19, 1863, Uruguayan General Venancio Flores, who {{was then}} {{an officer in the}} Argentine army and the leader of the <b>Colorado</b> <b>Party</b> of Uruguay, invaded his country, {{starting}} the Cruzada Libertadora, with open support of Argentina which supplied rebels with arms, ammunition and 2,000 men. Flores wanted to overthrow the Blanco Party government of President Bernardo Berro, which was allied with Paraguay.|$|E

25|$|Brazil {{had carried}} out three {{political}} and military interventions in the politically unstable Uruguay: in 1851 against Manuel Oribe in order to fight Argentine influence {{in the country and}} to end the Great Siege of Montevideo; in 1855, {{at the request of the}} Uruguayan government and Venancio Flores, leader of the <b>Colorado</b> <b>Party,</b> who were traditionally supported by the Brazilian empire; and in 1864, against Atanasio Aguirre. This last intervention would lead to the Paraguayan War.|$|E
25|$|Moríñigo had {{maintained}} order by severely restricting individual liberties, {{but as a}} result he created a political vacuum. When he tried to fill it with the <b>Colorado</b> <b>Party,</b> he split the party in two, and neither faction could establish itself in power without help from the military. The creation of one-party rule and order at the expense of political liberty and acceptance of the army's role as the final political arbiter created conditions for the emergence of Stroessner's regime.|$|E
25|$|Uruguay's 1830s were {{dominated}} by the confrontation between Manuel Oribe and Fructuoso Rivera, the two revolutionary leaders who had fought against the Empire of Brazil {{under the command of}} Lavalleja, each of whom had become the caudillo of their respective faction. Politics were divided between Oribe's Blancos ("whites"), represented by the National Party, and Rivera's Colorados ("reds"), represented by the <b>Colorado</b> <b>Party,</b> with each party's name taken from the colour of its emblems. In 1838, Oribe was forced to resign the presidency; he established a rebel army and began a long civil war, the Guerra Grande, which lasted until 1851.|$|E

50|$|When Dick Wadhams was elected, the <b>Colorado</b> Republican <b>Party</b> {{was trapped}} with serious debts from the 2002, 2004, and 2006 elections, totaling over $580,000. The <b>Colorado</b> Republican <b>Party</b> has since paid off {{all of its}} debts, mainly due to {{individual}} donations.|$|R
50|$|Addiego {{had been}} {{president}} of the Supreme Court since 1984 when the sitting president, General Gregorio Álvarez, who did not look favourably on the candidacy of the <b>Colorado</b> <b>Party's</b> Sanguinetti and his subsequent election to the presidency in November 1984, opted under pressure to resign in February 1985.|$|R
25|$|For the 2008 general elections, the <b>Colorado</b> <b>Party</b> {{was once}} again a favorite. However, this time the {{candidate}} was not an internal opponent to the President and self-proclaimed reformer, as in the two previous elections, but Minister of Education Blanca Ovelar, {{the first woman to}} appear as a candidate for a major party in Paraguayan history. After sixty years of one-party rule by the Colorados, the voters this time chose a non-politician, former Roman Catholic bishop Fernando Lugo, a long time follower of the controversial Liberation Theology but backed by the center-right Liberal Party, the Colorados' traditional opponents.|$|E
25|$|On May 14/15, 1811 Paraguay {{declared}} {{its independence from}} Spain. Since then, the country has {{had a history of}} dictatorial governments, from the Utopian regime of José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia (El Supremo) to the suicidal reign of Francisco Solano López, who nearly destroyed the country in warfare against the combined forces of Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay from 1865 through 1870. The Paraguayan War ended with massive population losses in Paraguay, and cessions of extensive territories to Argentina and Brazil. The post-war nation gradually formed a two-party (Colorado vs. Liberal) political system which came to be totally dominated by the <b>Colorado</b> <b>party</b> and only recently has changed into a multiparty system.|$|E
25|$|Within {{a couple}} of decades Paraguayan {{politics}} had come a full-circle. The Chaco War had sparked the February Revolution, which signaled the end of Liberal rule and ushered in a revived Paraguayan nationalism that revered the dictatorial past of the López era. The result was the Constitution of 1940, which returned near-dictatorial powers to the Presidency, that the Liberals had stripped away. When a brief flirtation with multi-party democracy led to the Civil war, the <b>Colorado</b> <b>Party,</b> loyal to the memory of López, was once again running Paraguay. Meanwhile, the influence of the armed forces in the domestic politics had increased dramatically as no Paraguayan government since the Chaco War held the power without its consent.|$|E

The Blanco Party looked to Saravia for leadership.|$|R
25|$|The city of Montevideo {{suffered}} a siege of eight years between 1843 and 1851, during {{which it was}} supplied by sea with British and French support. Oribe, {{with the support of}} the then conservative Governor of Buenos Aires Province Juan Manuel de Rosas, besieged the Colorados in Montevideo, where the latter were supported by the French Legion, the Italian Legion, the Basque Legion and battalions from Brazil. Finally, in 1851, with the additional support of Argentine rebels who opposed Rosas, the Colorados defeated Oribe. The fighting, however, resumed in 1855, when the Blancos came to power, which they maintained until 1865. Thereafter, the <b>Colorado</b> <b>Party</b> regained power, which they retained until past the middle of the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|The June 1992 {{constitution}} {{established a}} democratic {{system of government}} and dramatically improved protection of fundamental rights. In May 1993, <b>Colorado</b> <b>Party</b> candidate Juan Carlos Wasmosy was elected as Paraguay's first civilian president in almost 40 years in what international observers deemed fair and free elections. The newly elected majority-opposition Congress quickly demonstrated its independence from the executive by rescinding legislation passed by the previous Colorado-dominated Congress. With support from the United States, the Organization of American States, and {{other countries in the}} region, the Paraguayan people rejected an April 1996 attempt by then Army Chief General Lino Oviedo to oust President Wasmosy, taking an important step to strengthen the Paraguayan Republic.|$|E
25|$|On 15 February 1864, José Luís {{was given}} a four months leave to treat his health. He {{returned}} to active duty and was raised {{to the rank of}} brigadier on 29 July.

Another civil war had erupted in Uruguay between its Blanco Party and <b>Colorado</b> <b>Party.</b> The internal conflict led to the murder of Brazilians and the looting of their Uruguayan properties. The Brazilian government decided to intervene and mobilized an army. Brazil expected José Luís' small force to begin operations while its main army was being brought up to full strength.|$|E
