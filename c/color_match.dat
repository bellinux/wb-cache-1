500|$|In 1989, {{the company}} brought out Primo, {{a new line}} of lenses. Designed with a {{consistent}} <b>color</b> <b>match</b> between all the different focal-length instruments in the line, these were also the sharpest lenses yet manufactured by Panavision. Six years later, Oscars were awarded to the company and to three of its employees for their work on the Primo 3:1 zoom lens: Iain Neil for the optical design, Rick Gelbard for the mechanical design, and Eric Dubberke for the lens's engineering. According to the AMPAS citation, [...] "The high contrast and absence of flare, along with its ability to provide close focusing and to maintain constant image size while changing focus, make the Primo 3:1 Zoom Lens truly unique." [...] In 1991, the company released its new 65mm technology, System 65, though Arri had beaten it to market by two years with the Arriflex 765. The gauge was not widely readopted, and only two major Hollywood films were shot with the new 65mm Panavision process: Far and Away (1992) and Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet (1996).|$|E

40|$|This study {{proposes a}} vision model for {{individual}} colorimetric observers. The proposed {{model can be}} beneficial in many color-critical applications such as color grading and soft proofing to assess ranges of <b>color</b> <b>matches</b> instead of a single average match. We extended the CIE 2006 physiological observer by adding eight additional physiological parameters to model individual color-normal observers. These eight parameters control lens pigment density, macular pigment density, optical densities of L-, M-, and S-cone photopigments, and λmax shifts of L-, M-, and S-cone photopigments. By identifying the variability of each physiological parameter, the model can simulate <b>color</b> <b>matching</b> functions among color-normal populations using Monte Carlo simulation. The variabilities of the eight parameters were identified through two steps. In the first step, extensive reviews of past studies were performed {{for each of the}} eight physiological parameters. In the second step, the obtained variabilities were scaled to fit a <b>color</b> <b>matching</b> dataset. The model was validated using three different datasets: traditional <b>color</b> <b>matching,</b> applied <b>color</b> <b>matching,</b> and Rayleigh matches...|$|R

40|$|International audienceVarious {{recent studies}} have shown that {{observer}} variability can be a significant issue in modern display olorimetry, since narrow-band primaries are often used to achieve wider color gamuts. As far as industrial applications are concerned, past works on various aspects of observer variability and metamerism have mostly focused on cross-media <b>color</b> <b>matching,</b> an pplication context that is different from <b>color</b> <b>matching</b> on two displays, both in terms of human visual performance and the application requirements. In this paper, we report a set of three preliminary <b>color</b> <b>matching</b> experiments using a studio Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) display with broadband primaries, and a modern wide-color gamut Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) with narrow-band primaries, with and without surround. Two principal goals of these pilot tests are to validate the experimental protocol, and to obtain a first set of metameric data of display <b>color</b> <b>matches</b> under different viewing conditions. In this paper, various experimental design considerations leading to the current test setup are discussed, and the results from the pilot tests are presented. We confirm the validity of our test setup, and show that the average <b>color</b> <b>matches</b> predicted by the 1964 CIE 10 ° standard observer, although acceptable as average matches, can often be significantly and unacceptably different from individual observer <b>color</b> <b>matches.</b> The mean, maximum and the 90 th percentile values of the standard observer-predicted color difference of individual observer <b>color</b> <b>matches</b> were 1. 4, 3. 3 and 2. 6 ΔE* 00 respectively...|$|R

5000|$|Mass-produced and “semi-custom” {{prostheses}} allow {{women to}} choose from a few colors and sizes. The majority of mass-produced prostheses are self-adhering and last three months because the materials are weaker and the adhesion become weaker. Lack of projection, <b>color</b> <b>match,</b> shape, size, and texture are all among the common complaints of mass-produced prostheses (Sainsbury R 1991). Despite these complaints, mass-produced prostheses have shown some benefit. When given to patients for a three-month period between breast mount reconstruction and surgical NAC reconstruction, some patients actually preferred using the prostheses for dress purposes rather than to undergo an additional operation (Ward CM 1985). Mass-produced nipple prosthetics fail to meet satisfaction expectations in cases of single mastectomies.|$|E

50|$|Using {{materials}} that are metameric color matches rather than spectral color matches is a significant problem in industries where color matching or color tolerances are important. A classic example is in automobiles: the interior fabrics, plastics and paints may be manufactured to provide a good <b>color</b> <b>match</b> under a standard light source (such as the sun), but the matches can disappear under different light sources (fluorescent or halide lights). Similar problems can occur in apparel manufactured from different types of dye or using different types of fabric, or in quality color printing using different types of inks. Papers manufactured with optical brighteners are especially susceptible to color changes when lights differ in their short wavelength radiation, which can cause some papers to fluoresce.|$|E
