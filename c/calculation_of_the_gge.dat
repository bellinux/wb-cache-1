40|$|By {{combining}} classical Monte Carlo and Bethe ansatz techniques we {{devise a}} numerical method {{to construct the}} Truncated Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (TGGE) for the spin- 1 / 2 isotropic Heisenberg ($XXX$) chain. The key idea is to sample <b>the</b> Hilbert space <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model with <b>the</b> appropriate <b>GGE</b> probability measure. <b>The</b> method can be extended to other integrable systems, such as the Lieb-Liniger model. We benchmark the approach focusing on GGE expectation values of several local observables. As finite-size effects decay exponentially with system size, moderately large chains are sufficient to extract thermodynamic quantities. The Monte Carlo results are in agreement with both the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) and the Quantum Transfer Matrix approach (QTM). Remarkably, {{it is possible to}} extract in a simple way the steady-state Bethe-Gaudin-Takahashi (BGT) roots distributions, which encode complete information about <b>the</b> <b>GGE</b> expectation values in the thermodynamic limit.

40|$|The {{generalized}} Gibbs ensemble (GGE) {{was introduced}} {{ten years ago}} to describe observables in isolated integrable quantum systems after equilibration. Since then, <b>the</b> <b>GGE</b> has been demonstrated {{to be a powerful}} tool to predict <b>the</b> outcome <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relaxation dynamics <b>of</b> few-body observables in a variety of integrable models, a process we call generalized thermalization. This review discusses several fundamental aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>GGE</b> and generalized thermalization in integrable systems. In particular, we focus on questions such as: which observables equilibrate to <b>the</b> <b>GGE</b> predictions and who should play <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bath; what conserved quantities can be used to construct the GGE; what are the differences between generalized thermalization in noninteracting systems and in interacting systems mappable to noninteracting ones; why is it that <b>the</b> <b>GGE</b> works when traditional ensembles of statistical mechanics fail. Despite {{a lot of interest in}} these questions in recent years, no definite answers have been given. We review results for the XX model and for the transverse field Ising model. For the latter model, we also report original results and show that <b>the</b> <b>GGE</b> describes spin-spin correlations over the entire system. This makes apparent that there is no need to trace out a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system in real space for equilibration to occur and for <b>the</b> <b>GGE</b> to apply. In the past, a spectral decomposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weights <b>of</b> various statistical ensembles revealed that generalized eigenstate thermalization occurs in the XX model (hard-core bosons). Namely, eigenstates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hamiltonian with similar distributions of conserved quantities have similar expectation values of few-spin observables. Here we show that generalized eigenstate thermalization also occurs in the transverse field Ising model.
