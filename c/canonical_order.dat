A remark by Augustine {{at the turn}} of the fifth century presents the gospels as composed in their <b>canonical</b> <b>order</b> (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John), with each evangelist thoughtfully building upon and supplementing the work of his predecessors—the Augustinian hypothesis (Matthew–Mark).|$|E
25|$|The Domain Name System {{specifies}} a set {{of various}} types of resource records (RRs), which are the basic information elements of the domain name system. Each record has a type (name and number), an expiration time (time to live), a class, and type-specific data. Resource records of the same type are described as a resource record set (RRset). The order of resource records in a set, which is returned by a resolver to an application, is undefined, but often servers implement round-robin ordering to achieve load balancing. The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC), however, work on the complete set of resource record in <b>canonical</b> <b>order.</b>|$|E
25|$|On {{excavation}} of the site, several deposits of cuneiform clay tablets were found; all {{dating from the}} last phase of Ugarit, around 1200 BC. These represented a palace library, a temple library and—apparently unique {{in the world at}} the time—two private libraries, one belonging to a diplomat named Rapanu. The libraries at Ugarit contained diplomatic, legal, economic, administrative, scholastic, literary and religious texts. Various tablets are written in Sumerian, Hurrian, Akkadian (the language of diplomacy at this time in the ancient Near East), and Ugaritic (a previously unknown Northwest Semitic language). No less than seven different scripts were in use at Ugarit: Egyptian and Luwian hieroglyphs, and Cypro-Minoan, Sumerian, Akkadian, Hurrian, and Ugaritic cuneiform. Unique among the texts in Ugaritic are the earliest known abecedaries, lists of letters in alphabetic cuneiform, where not only the <b>canonical</b> <b>order</b> of Hebrew-Phoenician script is evidenced, but also the traditional names for letters of the alphabet.|$|E

This paper introduces the orderly pair of connected planar graphs, which extends the concept of <b>canonical</b> <b>ordering</b> to planar graphs not required to be triconnected. Let G be a connected planar graph. We give a linear-time algorithm that obtains an orderly pair (H, T) of G, where H is a planar embedding of G, and T is an orderly spanning tree of H. As applications, we show that the technique of orderly spanning trees yields (i) the best known encoding of G with query support, and (ii) the first area-optimal 2 -visibility drawing of G. ...|$|R
25|$|The Premonstratensian {{order was}} founded by St Norbert of Xanten who was firstly a canon at Xanten Cathedral. Unhappy with {{the way of life}} of his fellow canons, he left the Rhine lands for the diocese of Laon, in the north of France where the {{reforming}} Bishop Bartholomew was transforming his see into one that was more apostolic. Bartholomew persuaded Norbert to form a <b>canonical</b> <b>order</b> at Prémontré, in Aisne in 1120 and while the order was Augustinian in form, the canons wore the white habit and not the black. They followed an austere monastic life, but had a duty to preach and teach to those {{on the outside of the}} monastery walls. The order spread rapidly across Europe with the Abbot of Prémontré becoming Abbot-General for all the daughter-houses. Even before the first Abbot-General Hugh of Fosse died, one hundred and twenty abbots attended the annual general chapter. The Premonstratensians took on many of the methods of the Cistercians including land management and the use of lay-brothers to undertake the labour-intensive work of the communes.|$|E
500|$|The Frankfurt Parliament had {{declared}} the black-red-gold {{as the official}} colours of the German Confederation, with the red in the tricolour most likely referencing the Hanseatic League, and the gold and black symbolizing Austria as its empire, considered to be [...] "German", had an influence over (what would become) southern Germany. There are many theories in circulation regarding {{the origins of the}} colour scheme used in the 1848 flag. It has been proposed that the colours were those of the Jena Students' League (Jenaer Burschenschaft), one of the radically minded Burschenschaften banned by Metternich in the Carlsbad Decrees; the colours are mentioned in their <b>canonical</b> <b>order</b> in the seventh verse of Daniel August von Binzer's student song Zur Auflösung der Jenaer Burschenschaft ("On the Dissolution of the Jena Students' League") quoted by Johannes Brahms in his Academic Festival Overture. Another claim goes back to the uniforms (mainly black with red facings and gold buttons) of the Lützow Free Corps, comprising mostly university students and formed during the struggle against the occupying forces of Napoleon. [...] Whatever the true explanation, these colours soon came to be regarded as the national colours of Germany during this brief period, and especially after their reintroduction during the Weimar period, they have become synonymous with liberalism in general.|$|E
2500|$|The {{time has}} come for Orthodoxy in America to move beyond simple {{affirmation}} of historical, <b>canonical</b> <b>order.</b> It is time to encourage and develop cooperation among churches, which will prove to be a genuine blueprint for greater unity on all fronts. Specific principles need to be articulated and accepted by all jurisdictions in a common commitment to work in consort.

Following Boris I’s principle that the sovereignty of the state is inextricably linked to the autocephaly of the Church, the two brothers immediately took steps to restore the Bulgarian Patriarchate. [...] As a start, they established an independent archbishopric in Tarnovo in 1186. [...] The struggle to have the archbishopric recognized according to the <b>canonical</b> <b>order</b> and elevated to the rank of a Patriarchate took almost 50 years. [...] Following the example of Boris I, Bulgarian Tsar Kaloyan manoeuvred for years between the Patriarch of Constantinople and Pope Innocent III. [...] Finally in 1203 the latter proclaimed the Tarnovo Archbishop Vassily [...] "Primate and Archbishop of all Bulgaria and Walachia." [...] The union with the Roman Catholic Church continued for well over three decades.|$|E

[...] Speaking of [...] "fraternal relations between bishops" [...] during the first millennium, it states that [...] "these relations, among the bishops themselves, between the bishops and their respective protoi (firsts), and also among the protoi themselves in the <b>canonical</b> <b>order</b> (taxis) witnessed by the ancient Church, nourished and consolidated ecclesial communion. It notes that both sides agree [...] "that Rome, as the church that 'presides in love' according to the phrase of St Ignatius of Antioch, occupied the first place in the taxis (order) and that the bishop of Rome was, therefore, the protos (first) among the patriarchs. They disagree, however, on the interpretation of the historical evidence from this era regarding the prerogatives of the bishop of Rome as protos, a matter that was already understood in different ways in the first millennium"; and [...] "while the fact of primacy at the universal level is accepted by both East and West, there are differences of understanding with regard to {{the manner in which it}} is to be exercised, and also with regard to its scriptural and theological foundations".|$|E
