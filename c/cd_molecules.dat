In order to investigate the assembly of this complex, the ability of <b>C</b> 9 <b>molecules</b> to bind to C 5 b- 8 complexes was compared with the binding characteristics of C 9 for C 5 b- 8 complexes containing variable numbers of bound <b>C</b> 9 <b>molecules.</b> The apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of the <b>C</b> 9 <b>molecule</b> for the <b>C</b> 5 b- 8 site on a complement-sensitive strain of Escherichia coli was 1. 2 (+/- 0. 15) nM at 0 degree C. These conditions allow the binding of one <b>C</b> 9 <b>molecule</b> per <b>C</b> 5 b- 8 site. The C 5 b- 8 site containing one <b>C</b> 9 <b>molecule</b> bound a second <b>C</b> 9 <b>molecule</b> at 0 degree C only after incubation at 37 degrees C. The binding of C 9 to a C 5 b- 8 site containing one <b>C</b> 9 <b>molecule</b> {{was found to be}} 1. 3 (+/- 0. 2) nM. Therefore, the presence of a <b>C</b> 9 <b>molecule</b> did not significantly alter the binding capacity of the C 5 b- 8 site for additional <b>C</b> 9 <b>molecules.</b> A similar result was obtained by using rabbit erythrocytes bearing either C 5 b- 8 sites or C 5 b- 8 sites containing one <b>molecule</b> of <b>C</b> 9 per complex at 0 degree C. The similarity of binding characteristics for the first and second <b>C</b> 9 <b>molecules</b> argues that the initial <b>C</b> 9 <b>molecule</b> in the complex does not affect the binding of subsequent <b>C</b> 9 <b>molecules.</b> This suggests that a unique C 9 binding site that does not involve previously bound <b>C</b> 9 <b>molecules</b> may exist on the forming membrane attack complex...|$|R

40|$|The {{organization}} of bacteriochlorophyll <b>c</b> (BChl <b>c)</b> <b>molecules</b> was studied in normal and carotenoid-deficient chlorosomes {{isolated from the}} green phototrophic bacterium Chloroflexus aurantiacus. Carotenoid-deficient chlorosomes were obtained from cells grown {{in the presence of}} 60 μg of 2 -hydroxybiphenyl per ml. At this concentration, BChl c synthesis was not affected while the formation of the 5. 7 kDa chlorosome polypeptide was inhibited by about 50 % (M. Foidl et al., submitted). Absorption, linear dichroism and circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that the {{organization of}} BChl <b>c</b> <b>molecules</b> with respect to each other {{as well as to the}} long axis of the chlorosomes was similar for both types of chlorosomes. Therefore, it is concluded that the organization of BChl <b>c</b> <b>molecules</b> is largely independent on the presence of the bulk of carotenoids as well as of at least half of the normal amount of the 5. 7 kDa polypeptide. The Stark spectra of the chlorosomes, as characterized by a large difference polarizability for the ground- and excited states of the interacting BChl <b>c</b> <b>molecules,</b> were much more intense than those of individual pigments. It is proposed that this is caused by the strong overlap of BChl <b>c</b> <b>molecules</b> in the chlorosomes. In contrast to individual chlorophylls, BChl c in chlorosomes did not give rise to a significant difference permanent dipole moment for the ground- and excited states. This observation favors models for the BChl c organization which invoke the anti-parallel stacking of linear BChl c aggregates above those models in which linear BChl c aggregates are stacked in a parallel fashion. The difference between the Stark spectrum of carotenoid-deficient and WT chlorosomes indicates that the carotenoids are in the vicinity of the BChls...|$|R

First, dynamic scanning tunnelling microscopy revealed the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital features of <b>C</b> 60 <b>molecules</b> adsorbed on Si(111) -(7 x 7) with extremely high resolution at 77 K. Experimental data were compared with Hückel molecular orbital theory simulations to determine {{the orientation of the}} molecules on these surfaces. Second, <b>C</b> 60 <b>molecules</b> were imaged with a qPlus atomic force microscope, in the attractive force regime and appeared as bright spherical protrusions. The potential energy of interaction between the AFM tip and <b>C</b> 60 <b>molecules</b> adsorbed on Si(111) -(7 x 7) was quantified by force spectroscopy. Furthermore, a <b>C</b> 60 <b>molecule</b> was transferred to the scanning probe microscope tip and used as molecular probe to image the Si(111) -(7 x 7) surface and other <b>C</b> 60 <b>molecules.</b> The on-tip <b>C</b> 60 <b>molecule</b> was imaged with high precision. Hückel molecular orbital theory calculations accurately predicted the shape and characteristics of molecular orbitals observed with dynamic scanning tunnelling microscopy, which were strongly dependent on molecular symmetry, orientation, and adsorption angle. Using qPlus atomic force microscopy, chemical reactivity was probed close to or at the carbon atom positions in the C 60 cage. Density functional theory simulations showed that an (iono) covalent bond formed between a carbon atom and the underlying Si adatom was responsible for contrast formation. The pair potential for two <b>C</b> 60 <b>molecules</b> was also determined experimentally and found to be in very good agreement with the Girifalco potential (Girifalco, L. A., J. Phys. Chem., 1992. 96 (2) : p. 858). Using Hückel molecular orbital theory, the mutual orientation of a <b>C</b> 60 <b>molecule</b> adsorbed on the STM/AFM tip and a <b>C</b> 60 <b>molecule</b> adsorbed on the Si(111) -(7 x 7) surface was determined via comparison of simulated images to the experimental data. Individual <b>C</b> 60 <b>molecules</b> were also manipulated with qPlus atomic force microscopy. Manipulation of single <b>C</b> 60 <b>molecules</b> was performed on the Ag-Si(111) -(√ 3 x√ 3) R 30 o surface using scanning tunnelling microscopy at room temperature and at 100 K. The interaction was predominantly attractive.

40|$|An {{understanding}} of dynamic processes of proteins on the electrode surface could enhance {{the efficiency of}} bioelectronics development and therefore {{it is crucial to}} gain information regarding both physical adsorption of proteins onto the electrode and its electrochemical property in real-time. We combined high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) with electrochemical device for simultaneous observation of the surface topography and electron transfer of redox proteins on an electrode. Direct electron transfer of cytochrome c (cyt c) adsorbed on a self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) formed electrode is very attractive subject in bioelectrochemistry.
