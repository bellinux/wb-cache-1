50|$|Sternotherus odoratus is {{a species}} of small turtle native to southeastern Canada {{and much of the}} Eastern United States.

5000|$|Several {{sea turtles}} live along the Atlantic coast, {{including}} the hawksbill sea turtle, Kemp's ridley sea turtle, and loggerhead sea turtle. The {{green sea turtle}} and leatherback sea turtle are more common species along the southeastern coastline.

Species {{that are likely to}} use the refuge but are not documented include ringneck snake (Diadophis punctatus), milk snake (Lampropeltis triangulum), northern water snake (Nerodia sipedon), brown snake (Storeria dekayi, Maine Special Concern), Blanding's turtle (Emydoidea blandingii, Maine Endangered), and possibly, eastern racer (Coluber constrictor, Maine— Endangered), wood turtle (Clemmys insculpta, Maine—Special Concern) and <b>common</b> <b>musk</b> <b>turtle</b> (Sternotherus odoratus). Records indicate that both Blanding’s turtle and spotted turtle occur in many locations along the refuge boundary. Wood turtle and black racer records are much less common, and musk turtle records {{in the vicinity of the}} refuge are nonexistent. Surveys targeted at detecting turtles and snakes could be developed and implemented on refuge lands with particular attention to the occurrence of the rare, secretive Blanding’s turtle. Lands within the proposed acquisition boundary in Kennebunk and Biddeford have extensive vernal pool habitat that would benefit several Species of Concern.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{its small}} size, the <b>common</b> <b>musk</b> <b>turtle</b> {{generally}} makes {{a better choice}} for a pet turtle than other commonly available species, such as the red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans). Throughout their range, wild-caught specimens are commonly available, but the species is also frequently captive-bred specifically for the pet trade. (In the United States, USDA regulations ban the sale of turtles under four inches long as pets. This technically excludes most musk turtles, as most specimens found are smaller than 4 inches.) They readily accept a diet of commercially available turtle pellets, algae wafers, and various insects, such as crickets, snails, mealworms, bloodworms, earthworms. A varied diet is essential to a captive turtle's health {{and it is important}} to note that it should not be fed with turtle pellets only. A captive turtle being fed a high protein diet may develop vitamin A and E deficiencies. Supplemental calcium in the form of commercial powders or a cuttle bone is also a must. Aquatic plants (water lettuce, duckweed, etc.) can also be provided, as some musk turtles prefer more vegetables in their diet than others. Though less sensitive to limited access to UV lighting, common musk turtles require ultraviolet (UVA and UVB) lighting as most other turtle species do for proper captive care. As bottom dwellers, musk turtles are rarely seen basking, but a basking area should still be provided.|$|E

40|$|We studied turtle populations inhabiting a {{canal and}} a lake (both man-made) within a heavily disturbed, urban setting.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the kinematic patterns of initial food uptake, food transport, pharyngeal packing and swallow-ing in the <b>common</b> <b>musk</b> <b>turtle</b> Sternotherus odoratus. These data are supplemented by morphological descriptions of the skull and the hyolingual complex. Although the hyoid is mainly cartilaginous, S. odoratus still use exclusively hydrodynamic mechanisms in prey capture and prey transport. The tongue is relatively small, with weakly developed intrinsic musculature. We propose that the elasticity of the hypoglossum and the hyoid body impacts the capability of S. odoratus to suction feed, but allows these turtles to effectively re-position the food items within the oropharyngeal cavity during transport, manipulation and pharyngeal packing. We standardised conditions in all feeding events by using food items of the same consistence an...|$|E
40|$|In tetrapods, the oropharyngeal {{cavity and}} its {{anatomical}} structures are mainly, but not exclusively, {{responsible for the}} uptake and intraoral transport of food. In this study, we provide structural evidence for a second function of the oropharynx in the North American <b>common</b> <b>musk</b> <b>turtle,</b> Sternotherus odoratus, Kinosternidae: aquatic gas exchange. Using high-speed video, we demonstrate that S. odoratus can grasp food on land by its jaws, but is afterward incapable of lingual based intraoral transport; food is always lost during such an attempt. Scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy reveal {{that the reason for}} this is a poorly developed tongue. Although small, the tongue bears a variety of lobe-like papillae, which might be misinterpreted as an adaptation for terrestrial food uptake. Similar papillae also cover most of the oropharynx. They are highly vascularized as shown by light microscopy and may play an important role in aquatic gas exchange. The vascularization of the oropharyngeal papillae in S. odoratus is then compared with that in Emys orbicularis, an aquatic emydid with similar ecology but lacking the ability of underwater respiration. Oropharyngeal papillae responsible for aquatic respiration are also found in soft-shelled turtles (Trionychidae), the putative sister group of the kinosternids. This trait could therefore represent a shared, ancestral character of both groups involving advantages in the aquatic environment they inhabit...|$|E

40|$|I {{studied the}} <b>common</b> <b>musk</b> <b>turtle</b> (Sternotherus odoratus) at the {{northern}} limit of its range at Norway Bay, Quebec, from April to October 2006. Common musk turtles are habitat specialists and are selective of their habitats at the study-area and home-range scales. Beaver (Castor canadensis) lodges were preferred at the study-area scale. Common musk turtles also preferred beaver lodges, emergent wetlands, aquatic beds with floating and submerged vegetation as well as rocky shores at the home-range scale. At the location scale, common musk turtles chose shallower and cooler sites that contained more logs and submerged vegetation than the sites available at random. There was no significant effect of sex on habitat use at the location scale. There {{was no significant difference}} in mean daily movements between the sexes during the active season. However, sex and month probably interact together to influence the mean distance traveled daily by common musk turtles in Norway Bay. Males appeared to move more than females in May, July, and October. Females appeared to move more daily than males in August and September. Neither sex appeared to move more daily in June. However, our small sample size did not allow us to conduct a conclusive analysis. The mean home-range area was 23. 9 ha and was not different between sexes. I estimated a density of 4. 1 turtles/ha and a sex ratio of 1. 7 M: 1 F. The population includes 59. 6 % males, 35. 8 % females, and 4. 6 % juveniles.

40|$|Bei Schildkröten wurden bereits verschiedene Untersuchungsmethoden angewandt, um deren oropharyngealen Raumes zu beschreiben. Als effizienteste Methoden haben sich histologische, makro-, mikro- und elektronenmikroskopische Untersuchungen bewährt, sowie high-speed-Kinematographie als eine nicht-invasive Methode. In dieser Studie wird der oropharyngeale Raum der Europäischen Sumpfschildkröte Emys orbicularis der nordamerikanischen Gewöhnlichen Moschusschildkröte Sternotherus odoratus mittel histologischen Schnittserien und elektronenmikroskopischen Analysen näher untersucht. Sowohl die äußeren Strukturen der Zunge und der lingualen Papillen, als auch der innere Aufbau der oralen Mucosa wird beschrieben. Die Schildkrötenarten wurden gewählt, da sie zwar phylogenetisch weit voneinander entfernt sind, aber sehr ähnliche Habitate besetzen. Es ist also zu untersuchen, ob es einen Zusammenhang zwischen dem Habitat und der Ausbildung von spezifischen oralen Strukturen gibt. Obwohl es durchaus Variationen in der oropharyngealen Anatomie zwischen Emys orbicularis und Sternotherus odoratus gibt, wie zum Beispiel die Größe der Zunge, die Form der oropharyngealen Papillen und die Verbreitung der Geschmacksknospen, so gibt es auch einige Gemeinsamkeiten zwischen den Arten. Sie leben beide semi-aquatisch und sind gut ans Wasser angepasst. Deshalb haben beide Arten eine relativ kleine und unbewegliche Zunge, einen großen Hyoidapparat, keine komplexen monotubulären Drüsen und relativ kleine linguale Papillen und sind nicht fähig, an Land Nahrung zu sich zu nehmen. {{investigations}} of the oropharyngeal cavity of turtles different methods have been done so far.

Not only the outer structures of the tongue and lingual papillae but also the inner contents of the Oral Mucosa are examined. These two species of turtles were chosen, because phylogenetically they are far away from each other but they live in similar habitats. So it is interesting {{to see if there is}} a correlation between the environment and the anatomical structures of the oropharyngeal cavity. Though there are some variations in the oropharyngeal anatomy between E. orbicularis and S. odoratus, like the size of the tongue, the size and form of the lingual papillae, and the spreading of taste buds, in general there are many similarities between the two species. Both are semi-aquatic turtles, but well adapted to their aquatic habitat.
