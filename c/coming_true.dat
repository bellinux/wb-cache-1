They increased their attacks against European-American settlers and isolated outposts in the Indiana and Illinois Territories, resulting in the deaths of many civilians.

Tecumseh's warriors made up nearly half of the British forces that captured Detroit from the United States in the War of 1812. It was not until Tecumseh's death at the 1813 Battle of the Thames in Ontario that his confederacy ceased to threaten the interests of the United States.|$|E

He and Obi-Wan lead a mission to rescue Palpatine from Separatist {{commander}} General Grievous on board his starship. When the Jedi encounter Dooku, Anakin subdues the Sith Lord, and on Palpatine's urging, kills him in cold blood. They rescue Palpatine and return to Coruscant, where Anakin learns that Padmé is pregnant. Anakin has visions of Padmé dying in childbirth and becomes determined {{to prevent them from}} <b>coming</b> <b>true.</b> Palpatine tells Anakin that the dark side holds the power to cheat death, and eventually reveals that he is the Sith Lord Darth Sidious.

Desperate to save Padmé, Anakin pledges himself to the dark side and becomes Palpatine's Sith apprentice, Darth Vader. On Palpatine's command, Vader leads a legion of clones to kill everyone at the Jedi Temple and massacres the remaining Separatist leaders hiding on the volcanic planet Mustafar. Padmé confronts Vader and implores him to abandon the dark side, but Vader refuses. When Obi-Wan disembarks from Padmé's ship, Vader accuses his wife of conspiring against him and uses the Force to choke her into unconsciousness in a fit of rage. After a long and ferocious lightsaber duel, Obi-Wan defeats Vader, severing his legs and arm and leaving him at the bank of a lava river where he is horribly burned. Palpatine finds Vader and takes him back to Coruscant, where his apprentice's mutilated body is treated and covered in the black armored suit first depicted in the original trilogy. When Vader asks about Padmé's whereabouts, Palpatine explains to him that he killed Padmé in his anger; Vader screams in agony, his spirit broken. By the end of the film, Vader supervises the construction of the first Death Star alongside Palpatine and Wilhuff Tarkin.|$|E

In 1896–97, strikes hit Saint Petersburg, aided by the Marxists; believing his predictions to be <b>coming</b> <b>true,</b> Vladimir was unhappy at having to abandon the movement. The Russian government made use of a large network of prison camps and areas of exile on the verges of its empire to deal with dissidents and criminals; by 1897 there were 300,000 Russian citizens in this system, and Vladimir was now one of them. Permitted to make his own way there, the journey took 11 weeks, for much of which he was accompanied by his mother and sisters.

40|$|The female protagonist’s mad scene, since <b>coming</b> into <b>true</b> vogue in {{the early}} nineteenth-century Italian opera tradition, has been prized for its {{dramatic}} and poignant emotive qualities. This project explores four nineteenth-century mad scenes; Donizetti’s Lucia di Lammermoor (1835), Bellini’s I Puritani (1835), Meyerbeer’s Dinorah (1859), and Verdi’s Macbeth (1847), surveying the literature of each scene and providing formal analysis of musical attributes such as harmony, melodic structure, and formal design, all in comparison to generic operatic conventions. Musical elements generally associated with the operatic madwoman include the orchestral recollection of significant past themes, virtuosic coloratura lines, {{and the presence of}} imagined voices, all of which serve to propel her into an alternate realm of happiness, escape, and, arguably, potential liberation from social and musical confines. In interpreting compositional choices in these scenes, I pay special attention to the Kantian dichotomy of phenomenal and noumenal realms (i. e., our perceived reality versus the 2 ̆ 2 thing in itself 2 ̆ 2, an entity in its true form, which cannot be perceived by human senses), as discussed by Gary Tomlinson in his book Metaphysical Song: An Essay on Opera (1999). Analyses of these scenes enable us to determine how composers and society observed and portrayed the madwoman, her fervid personality, and distinctive power...|$|R
