50|$|In April 2014, Liu paid HK$281.24 million (US$36.3 million) for a 500-year-old Ming dynasty doucai <b>chicken</b> <b>cup.</b>|$|R
5000|$|After {{these first}} two murders, Solís' {{pathology}} evolved. Instead of simple orgies, {{she began to}} demand human sacrifices. She devised a [...] "blood ritual" [...] in which the sacrificed (typically a dissenter) was brutally beaten, burned, cut and maimed by {{all the members of}} the cult. Thereafter, blood-letting was practiced. The blood was deposited in a <b>cup</b> mixed with <b>chicken</b> blood, after which the victim was made to bleed to death. Animal sacrifices and the use of marijuana and peyote were also practiced in these rituals.|$|R
5000|$|There was {{a certain}} revival of the style in the Wanli period, and a larger one under the Yongzheng Emperor (1723-1735) of the Qing dynasty. Pieces were {{occasionally}} produced thereafter, in particular of the <b>chicken</b> <b>cups</b> and stem cups with grapes, {{two of the most}} admired designs of the Chenghua period. [...] The discovery and examination by the archaeologist Liu Xinyuan (...) and his team of a heap of discarded broken porcelains of the Chenghua period at the imperial kiln site at Jingdezhen [...] "revolutionised scholars' knowledge of patterns and forms of doucai".|$|R
5000|$|The style {{began in}} the 15th century under the Ming dynasty in the {{imperial}} factories at Jingdezhen, and its finest products come from a few years in {{the reign of the}} Chenghua Emperor, mostly small pieces like the famous <b>Chicken</b> <b>cups.</b> [...] The style was discontinued after a few decades, as a suitable overglaze blue was developed, but later revived under the Qing dynasty. It is {{not to be confused with}} the wucai style, which was a related early technique for polychome painting. Doucai can be translated as [...] "contrasted colours", [...] "fitted colours", [...] "colours which fit together" [...] or [...] "dove-tailed colours".|$|R
40|$|Antigenic {{molecules}} termed TOP, {{which are}} distributed in a dorsal greater than ventral concentration gradient in chicken retina, are expressed early in development (by 48 hr after fertilization) in the optic <b>cup</b> of <b>chicken</b> embryos {{and continue to}} be expressed in retina thereafter. 35 S-labeled-TOP-antibody complexes were purified by protein A-Sepharose column chromatography and subjected to NaDodSO 4 /polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. TOP also was purified from dorsal retina by anti-TOP IgG-Affi-Gel 10 affinity column chromatography. In both cases, one major band of protein at Mr approximately 47, 000 was obtained. A protein of Mr approximately 47, 000 also was purified from chicken embryo brain. Cultured cells dissociated from 8 -day chicken embryo retinas accumulated the amount of TOP expected of cells in the intact retina, depending on the position of the cells in the retina. TOP accumulations by cells dissociated from dorsal or ventral retina, mixed in different proportions, and cocultured were additive. These results show that TOP is a protein, that the gradient of TOP is established early in development, and that perpetuation of the gradient does not depend on the continuous presence of an extracellular gradient of diffusable molecules or on maintenance of interactions between cells...|$|R
40|$|Domestication is {{a process}} in which animals become adapted to a life among humans by means of selection. A reduced fear of humans is {{probably}} one of the first aims of selection, intentionally or unintentionally. Animals that have undergone the process of domestication have a different appearance than animals in the wild (domestic phenotype) and behave in a different way towards humans. In this study I have looked at foraging and explorative behaviours in an unselected parental generation of red junglefowl and their offspring. The parental generation were bred in three lines, a high line, with birds displaying a strong fear of humans, an intermediate line, birds showing a modest fear, and one low line, with birds performing a more tame behaviour towards humans. I presented the birds with three different feeding alternatives, familiar chicken food, meal worms camouflaged with wood shavings and just wood shavings. I counted number of pecks in the different food options, number of changes between sites and how many sites a bird visited. The results show that females of both generations were more explorative than males, by pecking more in cups of meal worms hidden in wood shavings whereas the males pecked more in <b>cups</b> containing <b>chicken</b> food. Females also moved around more in the arena. Results from the first selected generation show significant differences between the selection lines among the females, with females from the high and low groups being the most explorative...|$|R
40|$|Distributions {{of lesser}} mealworm, Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), in litter of a {{compacted}} earth floor broiler house in southeastern Queensland, Australia, were studied over two flocks. Larvae were the predominant stage recorded. Significantly low densities occurred in open locations and under drinker <b>cups</b> where <b>chickens</b> had complete access, whereas high densities were found under feed pans and along house edges where chicken access was restricted. For each flock, lesser mealworm numbers increased at all locations {{over the first}} 14 d, especially under feed pans and along house edges, peaking at 26 d and then declining over the final 28 d. A life stage profile per flock was devised that consisted of the following: beetles emerge from the earth floor {{at the beginning of}} each flock, and females lay eggs, producing larvae that peak in numbers at 3 wk; after a further 3 to 4 wk, larvae leave litter to pupate in the earth floor, and beetles then emerge by the end of the flock time. Removing old litter from the brooder section at the end of a flock did not greatly reduce mealworm numbers over the subsequent flock, but it seemed to prevent numbers increasing, while an increase in numbers in the grow-out section was recorded after reusing litter. Areas under feed pans and along house edges accounted for 5 % of the total house area, but approximately half the estimated total number of lesser mealworms in the broiler house occurred in these locations. The results of this study will be used to determine optimal deployment of site-specific treatments for lesser mealworm control...|$|R
40|$|In Australia, {{the lesser}} mealworm, Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), {{is a common}} insect pest of earth floor broiler houses, where it often occurs in large numbers in the bedding {{material}} or litter that is used on the floors. Lesser mealworms are reservoirs for several avian pathogens, parasites and food borne diseases. In addition, larvae damage broiler house structures by actively tunnelling into insulation and earth floors. Despite being a common and ubiquitous broiler house pest in Australia, until now, little was known of its ecology in earth floor broiler houses or its susceptibility to registered broiler house insecticides. To determine {{the factors that influence}} their localised abundance and distribution in litter, populations of lesser mealworm in several earth-floor broiler houses in sub-tropical Queensland were intensively sampled, experiments were undertaken and life tables constructed. Lesser mealworm larvae were the predominant stage recorded in all litter samples. Life table parameters used stage durations based on a mean broiler house temperature of 31. 3 °C. Within the broiler houses, substantial horizontal movement of larvae in litter to under feed pans was recorded and this behaviour was supported by life table analyses, which showed atypical lesser mealworm survivorship, suggesting movement by all larval ages. This movement results in large and significant aggregations of larvae under feed pans and along house edges, where chicken access is restricted. Significantly lower larval densities occurred in open locations and under drinker <b>cups,</b> where <b>chickens</b> had complete access. Small larvae appeared to aggregate predominately {{at the beginning of the}} flock but continued to move during most of the flock time. In addition, the experimental manipulations in open areas of the broiler house showed that lesser mealworms substantially increased in number inside caged areas without feed pans and under uncaged empty feed pans. Lesser mealworms under similar empty feed pans but enclosed with metal barriers did not increase in the same manner; these barriers significantly restricted their movement. Aggregated populations of lesser mealworms were found to be localised and independent of chicken-feed, manure, and the normally high adult beetle numbers that occur under permanent existing feed pans. Total broiler bird weight in the brooder section during the flock time was considered a driving factor for larval movement, and together with relatively high litter temperatures, a potential source of mortality across larval stages. At almost all types of locations within a broiler house, including experimental treatment locations, numbers of lesser mealworms typically increased over the first 14 d of the flock time, especially in more protected areas such as under feed pans and along house edges, peaked at ≈ 26 d, and then declined over the remainder of the flock time. In these protected areas or refuges, larvae peaked in numbers, and then left the litter environment to pupate in the earth floor prior to the end of the flock time. This behaviour seemed unrelated to density as the same temporal pattern of abundance was observed under pans within metal barriers, where much fewer insects occurred. It was not observed in uncaged open areas where chickens had complete access. As larvae move away from chickens to refuges, it is likely that populations fail to establish in open areas, but fluctuate in numbers and suffer high rates of mortality. Therefore a typical life stage profile in earth floor broiler houses consists of beetles that emerge from the earth floor at the start of each flock time, lay large numbers of eggs that produce larvae that peak in numbers at ≈ 21 d, and after a further 21 - 28 d leave the litter and pupate in the earth floor. These pupae produce adult beetles that begin to emerge prior to the end of the flock time. Removing and replacing litter in the brooder section at the completion of a flock time appeared to inhibit rises in numbers of lesser mealworms over the subsequent flock in the brooder section. In contrast, reusing litter in the grow-out section caused an increase in lesser mealworm numbers in the grow-out over the subsequent flock time. Areas under feed pans and along house edges accounted for 5 % of the total house area, but approximately half the estimated total number of lesser mealworms in the broiler house occurred in these locations. Because a high proportion of larvae move to under pan locations and aggregate, this behaviour could be exploited to better manage lesser mealworms by targeting applications of residual control agents at the commencement of the flock to areas under feed pans, which could maximize the efficiency of these agents, and in doing so, reduce the overall quantity of insecticide required to treat a broiler house. The most common practice used for management of lesser mealworm is the treatment of broiler house floors or bedding with insecticides. In Australia fenitrothion, cyfluthrin and spinosad are currently registered for broiler house application, and another insecticide, γ-cyhalothrin, is under consideration. Overall, the most commonly used insecticide throughout eastern Australia is the pyrethroid, cyfluthrin. Because of control failures using this chemical, resistance to cyfluthrin was suspected in Australian broiler farm populations of lesser mealworm. Consequently the responses of several field populations of beetles collected from broiler farms in different Australian states and an insecticide-susceptible reference population to cyfluthrin, spinosad and γ-cyhalothrin were measured in topical application bioassays. In addition, the susceptibility of six Australian broiler house beetle populations and the insecticide susceptible population to several pyrethroids (cyfluthrin, β-cyfluthrin, γ-cyhalothrin & deltamethrin) was measured to determine patterns of cross resistance. The importance of metabolic mechanisms of resistance in these field populations was investigated using similar assays and the synergist piperonyl butoxide. Beetle populations from eastern Australia were first tested with cyfluthrin and resistance (resistance ratios of up to 22 -fold at the LC 50) was found in almost all of them; with the degree of resistance in a given population directly proportional to the number of cyfluthrin applications it had received. Dose-mortality data showed that 0. 0007 % cyfluthrin (the LC 99. 9 of the susceptible population) could be used as a convenient discriminating dose to identify resistant populations. In addition, comparisons of cyfluthrin LC 50 values of three broiler populations and a susceptible population, collected and then assayed over a four year interval, indicated that values from all three broiler populations had increased over this time. For spinosad, comparisons of dose-response curves showed that all populations, including the insecticide-susceptible population, were equivalent in their response to spinosad, indicating no pre-existing spinosad resistance. Two of these field populations, including a resistant reference population, had confirmed cyfluthrin/fenitrothion-resistance, but showed no cross-resistance to spinosad. A discriminating concentration of 3 % spinosad (just above the highest recorded LC 99. 9 value of 2. 45 %) was set to separate resistant and susceptible individuals. For γ-cyhalothrin, baseline studies of beetle populations from most Australian states indicated that it was roughly twice as toxic as cyfluthrin, with a discriminating concentration of 0. 005 % γ-cyhalothrin chosen to detect any future changes in susceptibility. These same beetle populations were tested with the cyfluthrin discriminating dose to identify possible cross-resistance. Across all populations, there was a significant linear relationship between the γ-cyhalothrin LC 50 value and mortality induced by the cyfluthrin discriminating dose. In addition, repeat testing and regression analysis of specific beetle populations to γ-cyhalothrin showed that topical application was a very reliable and repeatable testing method. The γ-cyhalothrin study suggested that cyfluthrin can confer cross-resistance to γ-cyhalothrin in A. diaperinus, but the magnitude of this resistance is not predictable. The susceptibility of beetle populations to four pyrethroids with and without piperonyl butoxide showed that almost all populations, when compared to the reference susceptible population, demonstrated very low susceptibility to cyfluthrin, with some reduced susceptibility to β-cyfluthrin, deltamethrin and γ-cyhalothrin; cross-resistance patterns varied considerably between populations. Adding piperonyl butoxide had no effect on the susceptibility of the susceptible population to any of the insecticides, but it consistently increased the susceptibility of each of the five cyfluthrin-resistant populations to cyfluthrin, β-cyfluthrin and γ-cyhalothrin. The addition of piperonyl butoxide to deltamethrin had inconsistent effects on susceptibility. In general, adding piperonyl butoxide to the four pyrethroids did not completely restore susceptibility to these compounds in resistant populations, indicating the presence of other resistance mechanisms in addition to microsomal-monooxygenase and esterase based metabolic resistance mechanisms. The relative importance of these metabolic resistance mechanisms in each beetle population varied widely between pyrethroids, and the future addition of piperonyl butoxide to these pyrethroids might not necessarily improve their efficacy in the field. Following the laboratory toxicity testing of cyfluthrin and spinosad, field efficacy assessments of these two insecticides and diatomaceous earth, were made on two farms in south eastern Queensland. Diatomaceous earth is known to have insecticidal properties so it was chosen to assess its potential as a natural litter treatment on one farm. Insecticide treatments|$|R
