5|$|Carrots {{benefit from}} {{strongly}} scented companion plants. The pungent odour of onions, leeks and chives help repel the carrot root fly, and other vegetables that team well with carrots include lettuce, tomatoes and radishes, {{as well as}} the herbs rosemary and sage. Carrots thrive in the presence of caraway, <b>coriander,</b> chamomile, marigold and Swan River daisy. They can also be good companions for other plants; if left to flower, the carrot, like any umbellifer, attracts predatory wasps that kill many garden pests.|$|E

5|$|When {{they were}} first cultivated, carrots were grown for their {{aromatic}} leaves and seeds rather than their roots. Carrot seeds {{have been found in}} Switzerland and Southern Germany dating back to 2000–3000 BC. Some close relatives of the carrot are still grown for their leaves and seeds, such as parsley, cilantro, <b>coriander,</b> fennel, anise, dill and cumin. The first mention of the root in classical sources is from the 1st century; the Romans ate a root vegetable called pastinaca, which may have been either the carrot or the closely related parsnip.|$|E

Crabs are cooked and then stuffed with a red hot pepper paste called shatta.|$|E
5|$|Coimbatore cuisine is {{predominantly}} south Indian with rice as its base. Most local restaurants still retain their rural flavor, with many restaurants serving food over a banana leaf. Eating on a banana leaf {{is an old}} custom and imparts a unique flavor to the food and is considered healthy. North Indian, Chinese and continental cuisines are also available. Idly, dosa, paniyaram and appam are popular dishes. Coimbatore has an active street food culture and various cuisine options for dining. Arisi Paruppu Sadam, made from a mixture of dal and rice is a recipe that existed from fourth century CE and unique to the area. Kaalaan is a popular dish prepared by simmering deep fried mushrooms (usually chopped mushroom) in a spicy broth, until it reaches a porridge like consistency and served sprinkled with chopped onions and <b>coriander</b> leaves.|$|E
5|$|The {{variety of}} fruits and {{vegetables}} that Bengal has to offer is incredible. A host of gourds, roots and tubers, leafy greens, succulent stalks, lemons and limes, green and purple eggplants, red onions, plantain, broad beans, okra, banana tree stems and flowers, green jackfruit, and red pumpkins {{are to be found in}} the markets popularly known as anaj bazaar. Panta bhat (rice soaked overnight in water) with onion and green chili is a traditional dish consumed in rural areas. Common spices found in a Bengali kitchen are cumin, ajmoda (radhuni), bay leaf, mustard, ginger, green chillies, and turmeric. People of erstwhile East Bengal use a lot of ajmoda, <b>coriander</b> leaves, tamarind, coconut, and mustard in their cooking while those aboriginally from West Bengal use a lot of sugar, garam masala, and red chilli powder. Vegetarian dishes are mostly prepared without onion and garlic.|$|E
5|$|Rice is {{the staple}} diet, while fish is an {{integral}} component of coastal South Indian meals. Coconut and spices are used extensively in South Indian cuisine. The region has a rich cuisine involving both traditional non-vegetarian and vegetarian dishes comprising rice, legumes and lentils. Its distinct aroma and flavour is achieved by the blending of flavourings and spices including curry leaves, mustard seeds, <b>coriander,</b> ginger, garlic, chili, pepper, cinnamon, cloves, green cardamom, cumin, nutmeg, coconut and rosewater. The traditional way of eating a meal involves being seated on the floor, having the food served on a banana leaf and using clean fingers of the right hand to take the food into the mouth. After the meal, the fingers are washed; the easily degradable banana leaf is discarded or becomes fodder for cattle. Eating on banana leaves is a custom thousands of years old, imparts a unique flavor to the food and is considered healthy. Idli, dosa, uthappam, appam, pongal and paniyaram are popular dishes for breakfast. Rice is served with sambar, rasam and poriyal for lunch. Andhra cuisine is characterised by pickles and spicy curries. Chettinad cuisine is famous for non-vegetarian items and Hyderabadi cuisine is popular for its biryani.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus {{reports that}} cabbage, radish and turnip are sown in July after the summer solstice, along with beet, lettuce, mustard and <b>coriander.</b> Leeks, celery, onion and orache are sown in January. Cucumber, gourds, basil, {{purslane}} and savory, in contrast, he writes, are sown in April. Ripe seeds do not germinate at once but {{wait for the}} right time. He asserts that all the herbs can be grown from seed, while rue, marjoram and basil can be raised from cuttings, and garlic, onion and other bulbs are grown from their roots. All the flowers of a herb appear at one time, except for basil which puts {{out a series of}} flowers starting low on the plant. Cumin has the most fruits, but it is said you have to curse and insult the plant to get a good crop. Theophrastus describes varieties of some herbs, for instance that the white lettuce is sweetest and tenderest, while there are many kinds of onion, with Sardian, Cnidian, Samothracian and Ascalonian varieties from those regions. Garlic is said to be planted close to the solstice; the Cyprian variety is largest and is used in salads. All herbs except rue are said to like dung. Of the wild herbs, Theophrastus reports that some such as cat's ear are edible, whereas others like dandelion are too bitter to be worth eating.|$|E
25|$|The {{leaves are}} {{variously}} {{referred to as}} <b>coriander</b> leaves, fresh <b>coriander,</b> dhania, Chinese parsley, or (in the US and commercially in Canada) cilantro.|$|E
25|$|Persicaria odorata is {{commonly}} called Vietnamese <b>coriander,</b> or rau răm. The leaves {{have a similar}} odour and flavour to <b>coriander.</b> It {{is a member of}} the Polygonaceae, or buckwheat family.|$|E
25|$|<b>Coriander</b> is {{commonly}} found both as whole dried seeds and in ground form. Roasting or heating the seeds {{in a dry}} pan heightens the flavour, aroma, and pungency. Ground <b>coriander</b> seed loses flavour quickly in storage and is best ground fresh. <b>Coriander</b> seed is a spice in garam masala and Indian curries which often employ the ground fruits in generous amounts together with cumin, acting as a thickener in a mixture called dhana jeera.|$|E
25|$|<b>Coriander</b> {{potentially}} may {{be confused}} with culantro (Eryngium foetidum L.), an Apiaceae like <b>coriander</b> (Coriandrum sativum L.), but from a different genus. Culantro has a distinctly different spiny appearance, a more potent volatile leaf oil and a stronger aroma.|$|E
25|$|The fresh {{leaves are}} an {{ingredient}} in many South Asian foods (such as chutneys and salads); in Chinese and Thai dishes; in Mexican cooking, particularly in salsa and guacamole {{and as a}} garnish; and in salads in Russia and other CIS countries. In Portugal, chopped <b>coriander</b> {{is used in the}} bread soup Açorda, and in India, chopped <b>coriander</b> is a garnish on Indian dishes such as dal. As heat diminishes their flavour, <b>coriander</b> leaves are often used raw or added to the dish immediately before serving. In Indian and Central Asian recipes, <b>coriander</b> leaves are used in large amounts and cooked until the flavour diminishes. The leaves spoil quickly when removed from the plant, and lose their aroma when dried or frozen.|$|E
25|$|<b>Coriander</b> {{can produce}} an {{allergic}} reaction in some people.|$|E
25|$|Outside of Asia, <b>coriander</b> seed is used {{widely in}} the process for {{pickling}} vegetables. In Germany and South Africa (see boerewors), the seeds are used while making sausages. In Russia and Central Europe, <b>coriander</b> seed is an occasional ingredient in rye bread (e.g. Borodinsky bread), {{as an alternative to}} caraway.|$|E
