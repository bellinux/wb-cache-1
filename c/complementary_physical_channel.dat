40|$|This paper {{explores the}} state of the retail sector of the U. S. economy with respect to the use and {{adoption}} of the Internet. The paper estimates that Internet-channel retail sales accounted for approximately 1 % of the total retail sales in the beginning of 2000. This is approximately US$ 8 billion. While Internet retailers are continuing to experience significant growth, their competitors who come from the “bricks and mortar ” world of physical retailing are making significant inroads to a <b>complementary</b> Internet and <b>physical</b> <b>channel</b> strategy. This paper examines 15 firms that participate in varying forms of electronic commerce. I identify some of the best practices of firms using the Internet effectively in their business strategy by identifying some financial and technical measures of performance. While the future of electronic commerce is certainly rosy for some retailers, I project that it is unlikely that Internet-channel retail sales will surpass more than 10 % of the total retail sales in the U. S. I could make a mint Fill my pockets with more than lint I'll give you a hint It involves the "internet"...|$|R

This paper presents two types of Physical channels: the first type is downlink <b>physical</b> <b>channels</b> which consist of <b>Physical</b> Broadcast <b>Channel</b> (PBCH), <b>Physical</b> Downlink Shared <b>Channel</b> (PDSCH), <b>Physical</b> Multicast <b>Channel</b> (PMCH), <b>Physical</b> Downlink Control <b>Channel</b> (PDCCH), <b>Physical</b> Control Format Indicator <b>Channel</b> (PCFICH) and <b>Physical</b> Hybrid ARQ Indicator Channel (PHICH). The second type of <b>Physical</b> <b>channels</b> is uplink <b>physical</b> <b>channels</b> which consist of <b>Physical</b> Uplink Shared <b>Channel</b> (PUSCH), <b>Physical</b> Uplink Control <b>Channel</b> (PUCCH) and <b>Physical</b> Random Access <b>Channel</b> (PRACH). This paper also highlights the structure of PDSCH and PUSCH, discuss the algorithms of {{the two types of}} <b>physical</b> <b>channel</b> and each of its features. The aim {{of this paper is to}} discuss the well-designed PHY Channels which provide high cell-edge performance with specific features, such as dynamic bandwidth allocation to users, the design of reference signals and control channels.

5000|$|Each <b>physical</b> <b>channel</b> is time-{{multiple}}xed into multiple logical channels {{according to}} the rules of GSM 05.02. One logical channel constitute of 8 burst periods (or <b>physical</b> <b>channels)</b> which is called a Frame. Traffic channel multiplexing follows a 26-frame (0.12 second) cycle called a [...] "multiframe". Control channels follow a 51-frame multiframe cycle.

We extensively discuss the implications, the identification and the mitigation of these covert <b>physical</b> <b>channels.</b> For the purpose of identifying covert <b>physical</b> <b>channels</b> during the design and evaluation of the computing system, an adaption of Kemmerers shared resource matrix, namely the physical environment matrix, is presented. The physical environment matrix enables the computing systems designers and evaluators to systematically describe and classify physical environments and the associated covert channels that might be possible between two specific devices or operating system compartments. Through the specification of limited access to physical environments, {{the presence or absence}} of a covert <b>physical</b> <b>channel</b> can be formally demonstrated during the design and evaluation of the computing system...|$|R
