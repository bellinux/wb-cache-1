50|$|The {{invention}} of {{programmable logic controllers}} (PLC) allowed gas meter repair facilities to automate most of the manual bell prover's process and calculations. Instead of manually raising and lowering the bell prover, solenoid valves <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>PLC</b> control air flows through the meter. Temperature, pressure, and humidity sensors {{can be used to}} feed data into an automated bell PLC, and calculations for meter proofs can be handled by a computer or electronic device programmed for such a purpose. In the early 1990s, the PLC was replaced by PACs (Programmable Automated Controls) and modern computer systems. Sensors to read the index of a meter were added to further automate the process, removing much of the human error associated with manual bell provers.|$|E

40|$|For years, resistivity/conductivity 2 {{instrumentation}} {{has been}} used as a reliable indicator of ionic water quality, especially for ultrapure water (UPW). Traditionally, the instrumentation is procured, installed, powered up, and perhaps <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>PLC,</b> strip chart recorder, or a LAN. After that, the instrument and sensor receive no attention until a problem arises. Today, continuous calibration and verification are key elements in any QC and QA program. In recent years, users have been using standard solutions to calibrate sensors. However, a major complaint is that these solutions are not in the userâ€™s operational range, and thus are not ideal standards. Numerous standard solutions have been proposed, but none possess all of the desirable requirements: ease-of-preparation, resistivity value in the range of operation, impervious to air and other contamination, and verifiable. During the last several years, as a result of our investigations into the relationship between resistivity and temperature for UPW, we have developed a methodology for calibration that meet all of the criteria stated above. We will provide data to support 5 primary conclusions: 1. The relationship between temperature and resistivity for UPW is well known. 2. Resistivity sensors (for use in UPW) can be calibrated in high conductivity ASTM standard solutions under 1 Please see Acknowledgements for complete listing of contributors...|$|E

40|$|Control System {{based on}} PLC {{is widely used}} in {{industrial}} world. Mostly, PLC based control system has not use fuzzy logic technology. Fuzzy logic control is very easy and simple to implement. This kind of control system does not require exact mathematical model to represent output {{as a function of}} input. Input and Output have membership functions that are related with rules. Those membership functions are required to perform three major processes in fuzzy logic control which are Fuzzification, Rule Evaluation and Defuzzification. The system, which is designed, is a Fuzzy Control Unit minimum system that is designed to work with Omron PLC. This system provides fuzzy logic control facility for PLC. Using this Fuzzy Control Unit, a PLC can perform fuzzy logic contiol easily. This Fuzzy logic control is <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>PLC</b> thru Host Link Unit for data transmission, and is connected to computer to develop fuzzy's membership functions and rules. This Fuzzy Control Unit will start fuzzy calculation due to specific flag activation at certain memory location in PLC. Right after the flag is active the unit will take normalized fuzzy input, and then perform fuzzy calculation according to membership functions and rules, which are already stored in the system and previously downloaded from computer. After the fuzzy calculation is completed, the result will be sent to specific memory location in the PLC and the result flag will be activated. From the experiment which use a PC Motor Speed Control System, shows that Fuzzy Logic Control using the Fuzzy Control Unit works well with PLC and the time required for one fuzzy calculation process is relatively fast...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{control systems}} express control {{solutions}} {{by means of}} expressions, usually mathematically based. In order to completely express the control solution, {{a vast amount of}} data is required. In contrast, knowledge-based solutions require far less plant data and mathematical expression. This reduces development time proportionally. In addition, because this type of processing does not require involved calculations, processing speed is increased, since rule process is separate and all processes can be performed simultaneously. These results in improved product quality, better plant efficiency, simplified process, etc. Within this project, conventional PID control has already been implemented, with the control parameter adjustment and loop tuning being problematic. This is mainly due to a number of external parameters that affects the stability of the process. In maintaining a consistent temperature, for example, the steam flow rate varies, the hot well temperature varies, the ambient may temperature vary. Another contributing factor, the time delay, also affects the optimization of the system, {{due to the fact that}} temperature measurement is based on principle of absorption. The normal practice in industry to avoid an unstable control condition is to have an experienced operator to switch the controller to manual, and make adjustments. After obtaining the desired PV, the controller is switched back to automatic. This research project focuses on eliminating this time loss, by implementing a knowledge-based controller, for intelligent decision-making. A FLC design tool, which allows full interaction, whilst designing the control algorithm, was used to optimize the control system. The design tool executed on a PC is <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>PLC,</b> which in turn is successfully integrated into the process plant...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficient}} use of electricity and how people approach it, is a topic that has {{a big impact on}} the environment and society. The consumption management will be improved by the monitoring and the controlling of electrical installations. By creating a management of the industrial installations people will use the existing and new energy resources more careful. Communication is a key part in this process and that is why the improvement of data transmission is very important to obtain a controlled process. Transferring data is achieved by sending an electromagnetic signal by means of radio waves, electrical voltage, etc. by means of different types of communications channels. The main goal of this report is to contribute GECAD developing a connection between a superior network and an external one to create the possibility of monitoring and controlling devices linked to the networks. The communication devices used are modems which use radio waves to make the transmission. The two advanced radio modems (ARM-SE) that are used during this assignment have the ability to connect with slave devices using different types of communication protocols. All the different protocols to achieve a data transfer between the two networks have been investigated and analyzed to find the best solution to connect a programmable logic controller to the network of GECAD. A program has been created to access the data of an analyzer to obtain knowledge on how to implement analyzers in a SCADA system to improve monitoring of an electrical installation. This assignment will achieve {{a better understanding of the}} different protocols and operation modes used in the industrial sector to create intelligent buildings and office blocks. The whole assignment is set up to monitor the data of a power analyzer (CIRCUTOR) which makes it possible to test all the operation modes and develop the program to retrieve data from the analyzer. Thereafter the program was used to create a SCADA system to retrieve data from other analyzers (PM 130) <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>PLC</b> on an extern location. This is made possible because both analyzers are compatible so after changing some parameters, data could be retrieved easily. Despite a lot of difficulties with the modems, which creates a doubt of their reliability, it concludes that they are useful devices to transmit data for the intelligent buildings...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{has been}} carried out in autumn 2009 at Uppsala University for Boliden Mineral AB. Physical {{modelling}} has been used <b>to</b> model <b>a</b> comminution circuit. The model has then been linked <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>PLC.</b> When <b>a</b> concentrator is about to become operational Boliden Mineral AB have been looking for <b>a</b> way <b>to</b> test the PLC. The purpose of this report has therefore been to develop models for the subprocess in a concentrator and link these models to the PLC. The subprocess was a comminution circuit in Aitik 36. After models for the various processes had been developed they were implemented in Dymola/Modelica. Finally, the complete circuit model in Dymola were linked <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>PLC.</b> The model for an autogenous mill has become general since data from the actual process have not been possible to obtain. To compensate for this an evaluation of the model was conducted using operator experience and experience from development engineers. The conclusion is that Dymola/Modelica has proved <b>to</b> be <b>a</b> fine tool for modelling the processes that occur in a comminution circuit. It has also been proved possible to link these models <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>PLC.</b> By using physical models in Dymola/Modelica, it is possible to verify the code for <b>a</b> <b>PLC...</b>|$|R
