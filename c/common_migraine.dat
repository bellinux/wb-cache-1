5000|$|Carotidynia is a {{syndrome}} {{characterized by}} unilateral (one-sided) tenderness of the carotid artery, near the bifurcation. It was first described in 1927 by Temple Fay.

Recent histological evidence has implicated an inflammatory component of carotidynia, but studies are limited. Carotid arteritis is a much less common cause of carotidynia, but has much more serious consequences. It is a form of giant cell arteritis, which is a condition that usually affects arteries in the head. Due to this serious condition possibly causing carotidynia, and the possibility that neck pain is related to some other non-carotidynia and serious condition, the case should be investigated by a medical doctor. [...] Because carotidynia can be caused by numerous causes, Biousse and Bousser in 1994 recommended the term not be used in the medical literature. However, recent MRI and ultrasound studies have supported the existence of a differential diagnosis of carotidynia consistent with Fay's characterization.|$|E

50|$|Harmine, {{and plants}} {{containing}} {{significant amounts of}} harmine and other harmala alkaloids are generally not considered safe treatments for depression within the medical community. This bias however is primarily built on previous decades of experience with pharmaceutical non-specific MAOIs that block both MAO-A and MAO-B. Inhibiting MAO-A or MAO-B (in high enough doses) while consuming foods rich in tyramine, e.g. cheese, can cause tyramine, ordinarily metabolized by these enzymes, to accumulate to dangerous levels. This can cause a potentially fatal hypertensive crisis. Because harmine reversibly and selectively inhibits MAO-A and does not degrade MAO-B, MAO-B remains free to metabolize tyramine in the digestive tract. Consequently, the harmala alkaloids (including harmine) are unlikely to elicit tyramine-mediated hypertensive crisis, and a special diet {{does not need to}} be so strictly adhered to. Nonetheless, due to the reduction of the levels of tyramine degrading compounds in the gut, it is still not advisable to eat excessively large amounts of tyramine-rich food products. The reversibility and MAO-A selectivity of harmala alkaloids do not, however, prevent potentially fatal interactions with common medications such as antihistamines, most antidepressants, many stimulants, <b>common</b> <b>migraine</b> medications, some herbs, decongestants, expectorants, and common cough and cold medications.|$|E

40|$|Background: Familial hemiplegic {{migraine}} (FHM) is a rare, dominantly inherited subtype of migraine with transient hemiplegia during the aura phase. Mutations {{in at least}} three different genes can produce the FHM phenotype. The mutated FHM genes code for ion transport proteins that animal and cellular studies have associated with disturbed ion homeostasis, altered cellular excitability, neurotransmitter release, and decreased threshold for cortical spreading depression. The <b>common</b> forms of <b>migraine</b> are characterized interictally by a habituation deficit of cortical and subcortical evoked responses that has been attributed to neuronal dysexcitability. FHM and the <b>common</b> forms of <b>migraine</b> are thought to belong to a spectrum of migraine phenotypes with similar pathophysiology, and we therefore examined whether an abnormal habituation pattern would also be found in FHM patients. Methods: In a group of genotyped FHM patients (five FHM- 1, four FHM- 2), we measured habituation of visual evoked potentials (VEP), auditory evoked potentials including intensity dependence (IDAP), the nociception-specific blink reflex (nsBR) and compared the results to a group of healthy volunteers (HV). Results: FHM patients had a more pronounced habituation during VEP (P = 0. 025) and nsBR recordings (P = 0. 023) than HV. There was no difference for IDAP, but the slope tended to be steeper in FHM. Conclusion: Contrary to the <b>common</b> forms of <b>migraine,</b> FHM patients are not characterized by a deficient, but rather by an increased habituation in cortical/brain stem evoked activities. These results suggest differences between FHM and the <b>common</b> forms of <b>migraine,</b> as far as central neuronal processing is concerned. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Twenty-nine migraineurs {{underwent}} {{spectral analysis}} and topographic EEG mapping. In {{a case of}} an induced attack of classic migraine with a complex aura, posterior-anterior spreading of slow activities and depression of alpha activity contralateral to the neurological signs were the prominent findings. Another patient who developed a spontaneous attack of classic migraine with a visual aura had unilateral reduction of alpha and theta activity. In 19 out of 22 patients recorded during an attack of <b>common</b> <b>migraine</b> the only abnormality was markedly reduced alpha activity over one occipital region, usually {{on the side of}} the headache.

We selected 21 such polymerphisms previously reported {{to be associated with}} the <b>common</b> forms of <b>migraine</b> and genotyped 1740 individuals (1132 migraineurs) to determine whether any of these selected polymorphisms occurred more frequently in females with hormonally modulated migraine.
