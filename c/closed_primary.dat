25|$|Richey was a Democratic {{member of}} the state House (1976–1980) and the Senate (1980–1984). He left the Democrats in 1984 because of the party's {{abortion}} stance, became an independent for a decade, and then switched to the Republican Party in 1994 when the party won majorities in the U.S. Congress. In 2004, Richey was elected to the Louisiana Republican State Central Committee from state Representative District 61 in East Baton Rouge Parish. He defeated the African American Kirt Bennett, 102-65, in a low-turnout <b>closed</b> <b>primary.</b> Bennett had been a candidate for in 2003 for lieutenant governor. Richey was reelected to the central committee in the <b>closed</b> <b>primary</b> for party offices held on February 9, 2008. He defeated Cyrus Greco, 414 (57 percent) to 313 (43 percent).|$|E

Undeclared voters—those not registered with any party—can vote in either party primary. However, it does not meet a common definition of an open primary, because people registered as Republican or Democratic on voting day cannot cast ballots in the primary of the other party.|$|E

25|$|Congressional races {{have also}} been held under the jungle primary system. All other states (except Washington and California) use single-party {{primaries}} followed by a general election between party candidates, each conducted by either a plurality voting system or runoff voting, to elect Senators, Representatives, and statewide officials. Between 2008 and 2010, federal congressional elections were run under a <b>closed</b> <b>primary</b> system – limited to registered party members. However, upon the passage of House Bill 292, Louisiana again adopted a nonpartisan blanket primary for its federal congressional elections.|$|E
25|$|With the Republicans {{stripping}} Michigan and Florida of {{half their}} delegates for moving their primaries into January 2008 against party rules, {{the race for}} the nomination was based there. McCain meanwhile managed a small victory over Huckabee in South Carolina, setting him up for a larger and more important victory over Romney in Florida, which held a <b>closed</b> <b>primary</b> on January 29. By this time, after several scandals, no success in the early primaries, and a third-place finish in Florida, Giuliani conceded from the nomination race and endorsed John McCain the next day.|$|E
25|$|The Hansens {{were the}} parents of a son, Peter Arthur Hansen (born 1936). Their only daughter, Mary Mead (1935-1996), was the {{unsuccessful}} Republican gubernatorial nominee in 1990 against incumbent Democratic Governor Michael J. Sullivan of Douglas in Converse County. Sullivan won his second term by defeating Mead, 104,638 votes (65.4 percent) to her 55,471 ballots (34.6 percent). In the general election, Mead polled only 4,311 more votes than she had procured in her <b>closed</b> <b>primary.</b> Hence, she was unable to procure voters beyond her base of support within the GOP.|$|E

25|$|Unlike many {{northern}} Republican transplants to Louisiana {{who became}} Democrats {{so that they}} could participate in the state's then pivotal <b>closed</b> <b>primary</b> elections, Colten maintained Republican affiliation and could hence vote only in general elections or in special elections. In June 1966, Colten announced his candidacy for mayor of Minden, a position once held by a former Democratic governor, Robert F. Kennon. Minden has also produced five congressmen, including Democrat Jerry Huckaby, who graduated from Minden High School in 1959. But Huckaby's Fifth Congressional District, which he represented from 1977 to 1993, never included Webster Parish until Huckaby's defeat and then only temporarily.|$|E

2500|$|Wallace next {{appeared}} {{on the ballot in}} Indiana, which had a long history of Ku Klux Klan activity, against Governor Matthew E. Welsh, who was running specifically so that Wallace would not be unopposed. Welsh considered Wallace a formidable opponent and took no chances, manipulating party machinery and arranging for a photograph of himself shaking hands with President Johnson; meanwhile, the Democratic State Committee began a $75,000 advertising campaign on his behalf. Welsh stumped across the state touting his civil rights credentials and denigrating Wallace. His slogan was [...] "Clear the way for LBJ, vote Welsh the fifth of May." [...] He also benefited from the fact that Indiana at the time had a unique type of <b>closed</b> <b>primary</b> which technically allowed Republicans to vote for Wallace but required them to sign an affidavit that they would vote for the Democrat in the general election.|$|E

2500|$|Only {{one state}} held a primary in April. This was Pennsylvania, on April 22. Although Obama {{made a strong}} effort to win Pennsylvania, Hillary Clinton won that primary by nearly 10%, with {{approximately}} 55% of the vote. Obama had outspent Clinton three to one in Pennsylvania, but his comment at a San Francisco fundraiser that small-town Americans [...] "cling" [...] to guns and religion drew sharp criticism from the Clinton campaign and may have hurt his chances in the Keystone State. In addition, Clinton had several advantages in Pennsylvania. Throughout the primary process, she relied on the support of older, white, working class voters. Pennsylvania held a <b>closed</b> <b>primary,</b> which means that only registered Democrats could vote, and, according to Ron Elving of NPR, the established Democratic electorate [...] "was older, whiter, more Catholic and more working-class than {{in most of the}} primaries to date." [...] After Pennsylvania, Obama had a higher number of delegates and popular votes than Clinton did and was still in a stronger position to win the nomination. Clinton, however, had received the endorsement of more superdelegates than Obama.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{days before}} the Republican {{convention}} in Chicago began its proceedings, Reese won a low-turnout senatorial <b>closed</b> <b>primary</b> victory over William Dane (1893-1966) of New Orleans. Reese received 762 votes; Dane, 278. Reese then attended the convention and thereafter campaigned across {{the state in the}} fall. In Lake Charles, he claimed that Senator Ellender had been lax in protecting military installations in Louisiana from being downsized or dismantled, with the impacted military services sent to bases in other states. [...] "There has been inadequate representation of the state in these matters," [...] Reese said. Ellender had been critical of the investigations into communist infiltration of the U.S. government waged in the 1950s by the late U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin. Reese even accused Ellender of being [...] "soft on communism". The Democrat retorted that Reese's allegation came with [...] "ill grace for the spokesman for the member of a party (the Eisenhower administration) which has permitted the establishment of a Red-dominated beach head (Cuba) only ninety miles from our shores to attack my record against the spread of communism." ...|$|E
5000|$|This {{constitutionality}} {{raises a}} problem. The most popular {{alternative to the}} open primary is the <b>closed</b> <b>primary.</b> However, a mandatory <b>closed</b> <b>primary</b> can also be unconstitutional. In Tashjian v. Republican Party of Connecticut, the United States Supreme Court determined that Connecticut’s <b>closed</b> <b>primary</b> law was unconstitutional. The Connecticut <b>closed</b> <b>primary</b> law “required voters in any political party primary to be registered members of that party.” The Republican Party of Connecticut, however, wanted to allow independents {{to vote in the}} Republican primary if they so chose. The problem with this <b>closed</b> <b>primary</b> law was that it prevented the Republican Party from allowing independent “registered voters not affiliated with any party to vote in Republican primaries for federal and statewide offices.” Since the Republican Party of Connecticut was not able to choose who it wanted to vote in the primary, the United States Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, stated that the <b>closed</b> <b>primary</b> law in Connecticut “impermissibly burdens the right of the Party and its members protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.” ...|$|E
