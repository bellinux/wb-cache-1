Similarly, the paths that connect the towns of San Vicente de Jesus San Vicente and La Soledad Benítez-Paradise in this town, there were cuts in solitary vehicle traffic. In the community of La Soledad, heavy rains accompanied by hail hit 38 homes, crops and <b>coffee</b> <b>grounds</b> cultivation in the region. In Colima, 50 homes and two hotels were inundated by flood waters, leaving MXN 3million ($231,000USD) in damage. In Puebla, heavy rains produced by the outer bands of the hurricane triggered flooding that killed two people. In addition to the fatalities, 20 people were injured by the storm. In the wake of the storm, the Government of Mexico allocated roughly MXN 3million ($231,000USD) in funds which would be distributed to 96 businesses significantly affected by the storm. These funds accounted for supplies, such as refrigerators and stoves to help restart their industries.|$|E

50|$|If a brewing {{method is}} used in which the time of {{exposure}} of the <b>ground</b> <b>coffee</b> to the heated water is adjustable, then a short brewing time {{can be used for}} finely <b>ground</b> <b>coffee.</b> This produces coffee of equal flavor yet uses less <b>ground</b> <b>coffee.</b> A blade grinder does not cause frictional heat buildup in the <b>ground</b> <b>coffee</b> unless used to grind very large amounts as in a commercial operation.

25|$|A coffee {{percolator}} {{is a type}} of pot used to brew coffee. In {{the case}} of coffee-brewing the solvent is water, the permeable substance is the <b>coffee</b> <b>grounds,</b> and the soluble constituents are the chemical compounds that give coffee its color, taste, and aroma.

Oats and rice are anomalous in that they also contain a majority of soybean-like protein. Cocoa, for example, contains the 7S globulin, which contributes to cocoa/chocolate taste and aroma;, whereas coffee beans (<b>coffee</b> <b>grounds)</b> contain the 11S globulin responsible for coffee's aroma and flavor.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{sustainable}} ways of mushroom cultivation is using <b>coffee</b> <b>grounds</b> as a substrate. This process was pioneered by Prof. Chang, Shuting /www.mushroominfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Chang-Bio-FINAL.pdf> in the early 1990s while {{he worked at the}} Chinese University in Hong Kong. Coffee ground are sterile, and rich in fibers. It is more environmentally-friendly; as an estimated millions of kilos of coffee waste disposed in landfill every day, which could be diverted into sustainable food production. The spent substrate, after harvesting mushrooms, is enriched in essential amino-acids, and therefore an ideal feed for animals /www.sistemekofungi.com/>.|$|E
25|$|As control measures, baits are {{the norm}} in both {{agriculture}} and the garden. In recent years, iron phosphate baits have emerged and are preferred over the more toxic metaldehyde, especially because domestic or wild animals may {{be exposed to the}} bait. The environmentally safer iron phosphate {{has been shown to be}} at least as effective as baits. Methiocarb baits are no longer widely used. Parasitic nematodes (Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita) are a commercially available biological control method that are effective against a wide range of common slug species. The nematodes are applied in water and actively seek out slugs in the soil and infect them, leading to the death of the slug. This control method is suitable for use in organic growing systems. Other slug control methods are generally ineffective on a large scale, but can be somewhat useful in small gardens. These include beer traps, diatomaceous earth, crushed eggshells, <b>coffee</b> <b>grounds,</b> and copper. It is of scientific interest that salt kills slugs by causing water to leave the body owing to osmosis but this is not used for agricultural control as soil salinity is detrimental to crops.|$|E

25|$|Coffee may be brewed by {{steeping}} in {{a device}} {{such as a}} French press (also known as a cafetière, coffee press or coffee plunger). Ground coffee and hot water are combined in a cylindrical vessel and left to brew for a few minutes. A circular filter which fits tightly in the cylinder fixed to a plunger is then pushed {{down from the top}} to force the grounds to the bottom. The filter retains the grounds at the bottom as the coffee is poured from the container. Because the <b>coffee</b> <b>grounds</b> are in direct contact with the water, all the coffee oils remain in the liquid, making it a stronger beverage. This method of brewing leaves more sediment than in coffee made by an automatic coffee machine. Supporters of the French press method point out that the sediment issue can be minimized by using the right type of grinder: they claim that a rotary blade grinder cuts the coffee bean into a wide range of sizes, including a fine coffee dust that remains as sludge {{at the bottom of the}} cup, while a burr grinder uniformly grinds the beans into consistently-sized grinds, allowing the coffee to settle uniformly and be trapped by the press. Within the first minute of brewing 95% of the caffeine is released from the coffee bean.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} find the optimum {{condition}} to prepare activated charcoal from spent <b>coffee</b> <b>ground</b> and to examine the adsorption efficiency of the BTEX released from water and oil base paints. The optimum condition {{was found to be}} carbonization at 400 ℃ for 1 h, followed by activation with H 3 PO 4 at a 1 : 1 (w/w) impregnation ratio and then carbonized at 700 ℃ for 1 h. This condition gave the highest iodine number (300. 6 ± 5. 1 mg/g), Brunaeur-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area (1, 769 m 2 /g), pore width (0. 7947 nm) and pore volume (0. 7517 cm 3 /g). The efficiency of the activated charcoal to adsorb the benzene and toluene emitted from normal and low volatile organic compounds water base paints was 99. 8 % and 99. 7 %, respectively. Furthermore, the adsorption efficiency of the activated charcoal from spent <b>coffee</b> <b>ground</b> (96. 99 ± 0. 54 %) to remove the total BTEX released from oil base paints was higher than that achieved with the charcoal without chemical activation (66. 97 ± 2. 11 %) or without carbonization (51. 83 ± 10. 32 %). The produced activated charcoal from spent <b>coffee</b> <b>ground</b> by chemical activation was suitable for use as an adsorbent of the BTEX released from water and oil base paints...|$|R

The soil sample {{in this study was}} collected from the experimental farm of Cantho University. The biomixture was applied with 3 levels: 5, 10 and 15 % (w/w). A commonly recommended inorganic fertilizer application rate for Okra was used as control treatment and 15 % of used <b>coffee</b> <b>ground</b> as another treatment to study a single effect of used <b>coffee</b> <b>ground</b> on yield of Okra and soil fertility.   Results showed that although the plan performance was much better in the control treatment, the highest yield of Okra was found in the treatments amended with 10 and 5 % of the biomixture and was 167 and 161 g/plant/pot, respectively. The yield was much higher in these two treatments than that in the control treatment. The appearance of Okra fruits in the amended biomixture treatments reached the standard quality for selling. Moreover, organic matter, N, P, pH, bacterial and fungal cell counts in soils were enhanced considerably when amended with this biomixture. Five percent of the biomixture performed as the best treatment to enhance Okra yield in the greenhouse experiment...|$|R
