40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that, by the P/As substitution—without doping {{of charge}} <b>carriers—in</b> a FeAs-layer-based parent compound, superconductivity can be universally introduced. The maximum superconducting critical temperature (Tc) of BaFe 2 (As 1 -xPx) 2 achieves 30 K. The P doping in LnFeAsO system (Ln = La and Sm) produces superconductivity below 11 K. The normal-state resistivity obeys linear temperature dependence and the normal-state Hall coefficient shows strong temperature dependence. These non-Fermi liquid behaviors suggest magnetic quantum criticality. The maximum Tc values in different systems correlates strongly with the diagonal bondangle of Fe–As–Fe, implying {{the important role}} of the next-nearest- neighbor magnetic exchange coupling in iron pnictide superconductors...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{prevalence}} and severity of depression in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients, and healthy participants. Methods: Two hundred and fifty-three persons participated in this cross-sectional study between 2011 and 2012 in Imam Khomeini Hospital. The prevalence and severity of depression were assessed using the Hamilton Scale. Results: There was significantly higher prevalence of depression in CHC patients (35. 9 %) than in healthy participants (11. 3 %) and CHB patients (19. 8 %) (both P 0. 05). Inactive HBsAg carriers differed significantly from CHB patients—excluding inactive HBsAg <b>carriers—in</b> depression prevalence (10. 0 % vs. 29. 3 %; P 0. 05). Conclusion: Depression screening in chronic hepatitis B and chronic hepatitis C patients may be beneficial in disease management.

40|$|The {{narrow gap}} {{semiconductor}} FeSi owes its strong paramagnetism to electron-correlation effects. Partial Co substitution for Fe produces a spin-polarized doped semiconductor. The spin polarization causes {{suppression of the}} metallic reflectivity and increased scattering of charge carriers, in contrast to what happens in other magnetic semiconductors, where magnetic order reduces the scattering. The loss of metallicity continues progressively even into the fully polarized state, and entails {{as much as a}} 25 % reduction in average mean-free path. We attribute the observed effect to a deepening of the potential wells presented by the randomly distributed Co atoms to the majority spin carriers. This mechanism inverts the sequence of steps for dealing with disorder and interactions from that in the classic Al'tshuler Aronov approach-where disorder amplifies the Coulomb interaction between <b>carriers-in</b> that here, the Coulomb interaction leads to spin polarization which in turn amplifies the disorder-induced scattering...|$|R
40|$|Voltage-gated Ca 2 + conductances were {{investigated}} with the whole-cell patch-clamp technique-either using Ca 2 + or Ba 2 + as charge <b>carriers-in</b> NB 69 human neuroblastoma cells plated in 'defined' serum-free (DM) and in 'astroglial-conditioned' media (CM). Cells expressed the microtubule associated protein 1 A when plated in both media, indicating neuronlike differentiation. Cells of similar {{sizes and shapes}} were selected for recordings. Different sets of voltage-gated Ca 2 + current types were usually expressed in DM- and CM-plated cells. DM-plated cells exhibited a high-voltage-activated current (HVAC) in isolation, whereas 43 % of the CM-plated cells also displayed the low-voltage-activated current (LVAC). The membrane surface density of the HVAC was about twofold higher in CM than in DM-plated cells and increased with plating time from 10 and 16 pA/pF (days 1 - 4) to 24 and 37 pA/pF (days 5 - 10) in DM- and CM-plated cells, respectively. However, the amplitude of the LVAC did not change significantly with culture age. In conclusion, NS 69 cells expressed HVAC in isolation when plated in DM, whereas both HVAC and LVAC were present in many CM-plated cells, suggesting that the CM contained diffusible factors secreted by astroglial cells which: (1) could induce {{the appearance of the}} LVAC and (2) increased HVAC current expression.

40|$|Background. Human-to-human {{transmission}} of the persistent infection establishing Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) occurs via saliva. Tonsils act as important portal of entry and exit of EBV. The contagiousness of pediatric EBV carriers and {{the role played by}} tonsillar enlargement (TE) are not known. Methods. We compared EBV shedding in mouthwash samples from pediatric EBV carriers with or without TE to that in mouthwash samples from pediatric patients with infectious mononucleosis (IM), the symptomatic form of primary infection if delayed after the age of 5 years. EBV DNA was quantified by polymerase chain reaction, and contagiousness was assessed using the cord lymphocyte transformation assay. Results. EBV carriers with TE shed EBV DNA at an almost similar frequency (although in lower amounts) as pediatric patients with acute IM but more frequently () and in higher amounts () than EBVP!. 001 Pp. 038 carriers without TE. EBV DNA levels in mouthwash samples from EBV carriers with TE mirrored levels in tonsils and gradually declined after tonsillectomy. Almost half of the mouthwash samples from pediatric EBV carriers contained infectious EBV. Conclusions. Pediatric EBV <b>carriers—in</b> particular, those with TE—may considerably contribute to the spread-ing of EBV in industrialized countries. More than 90 % of the adult population carry Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a human gammaherpesvirus that es-tablishes latency in memory B cells to persist in the host [1]. Thus, EBV {{is one of the most}} successfully spreading viruses [2]. The members of the population involved in the spreading of EBV are only incompletely defined. Human-to-human {{transmission of}} EBV occurs main-ly via saliva [1]. Palatine tonsils act as an important sit...|$|R
