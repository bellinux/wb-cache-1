40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of active control on asymmetric flows around circular cones is investigated computationally using cone spinning and rotatory oscillation around its axis. The investigation uses the time-accurate {{solution of the}} unsteady, compressible, full Navier-Stokes equations with the implicit, upwind, flux-difference splitting, finite-volume scheme. The present solutions are obtained under the locally-conical-flow assumption {{in order to understand}} the flow physics using very fine grids for reasonable flow resolution at low computational cost. For all the computational solutions, a grid of 241 x 81 x 2 points in the wrap-around, normal and axial directions, respectively, is used. The <b>grid</b> is <b>spinning</b> or oscillating rigidly with the cone according to its motion and the kinematical and dynamical boundary conditions are modified accordingly. The computational applications include the effects of uniform spinning rates and periodic rotatory oscillations at different amplitudes and frequencies on the flow asymmetry...|$|R

40|$|Environmental {{constraints}} {{imposed on}} hydropower plant operation are usually {{given in the}} form of minimum environmental flows and, in some cases, {{in the form of}} maximum and minimum rates of change of flows, or ramping rates. Environmental constraints reduce the amount of water available to produce electricity and limit the contribution of peak hydropower plants to adapting the power supply to the demand and to providing certain ancillary services to the electrical <b>grid,</b> such as <b>spinning</b> reserve or load-frequency control. The objective {{of this paper is to}} assess the economic impact of environmental constraints on short-term hydropower plant operation. For that purpose, a revenue-driven daily optimization model based on mixed integer linear programming is used. The model considers the head variation and its influence on the units' efficiency, as well as the option of starting-up or shutting-down the plant at any hour of the day, should it be advantageous, while releasing the environmental flow through the bottom outlets. In order to illustrate the applicability of the methodology, it is applied in a real hydropower plant under different operating conditions and environmental constraints.

The production of ultra-short electromagnetic waves by the retarding field method is analyzed. It is found that to generate oscillations of {{very short wave}} lengths, it is more effective {{to reduce the size}} of the electrodes of the vacuum tube and to design the tubes to oscillate higher orders than to increase the grid potential. Experiments were made with the Pliotron FP- 126 tubes as retarding field oscillators. These tubes generated strong normal and higher order oscillations. The wave length of the normal oscillations differed considerably from the values calculated from the Barkhausen and Scheibe equations. For the higher order oscillations, the observed wave lengths were approximately equal to values calculated according to Potapenko’s formula: [ [...] . ]. It was found that the predominating higher order oscillations were generated by the <b>grid</b> <b>coil</b> at its natural frequency. Its wave length agrees with that calculated from its dimensions. Tubes with plate diameters as small as 0. 05 cm. were made. They generated normal as well as higher order oscillations. They were designed so that the grid had a natural wave length of about 1 cm. The grid potentials calculated agree fairly well with the values observed. The energy of oscillations with these tubes was exceedingly small. The wave length of 1 cm. is about the shortest limit that can be obtained by the retarding field method...|$|R

Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 70 - 72). Saving energy {{is now one of}} the major concerns for the researchers. Still a lot of fossil fuels are being consumed directly or indirectly just for cooking and hence affecting the global environment. With the rapid increase in demand of energy for cooking with proportion to population increase, it will not take much time to finish all the resources that are available now. According to the thesis, energy for cooking is mostly supplied from solar photovoltaic panels in alliance with national grid line. The major contribution of this project will be the invention of re-designing existing stove <b>coil.</b> The national <b>grid</b> will be in action only when, panel and battery are not giving sufficient power to the load. An Electric Charge Controller will ensure safety of the system and store charge in the Battery. The research given in this thesis aims at analyzing the time requirement for cooking same foods in comparison with the gas or normal electric stove. To show the effectiveness as compared to natural gas or electric stove, the thesis contains a huge statistical data, taken for a number of times. Modification of the stove for providing variable energy to cook different food is the future work of the thesis. Md. Shariful IslamMd. Sabbir Bin AzadHumayra Fakir RongonB.

However, a clash with Robert Kubica over second place on the third to last lap of the race forced both to retire. Vettel attempted to finish the race on three wheels behind the safety car to salvage some points, but eventually pulled off to the side. He thought that he would be able to attempt this because the yellow flag resulting from his incident forbids overtaking; instead he was given a ten-place grid penalty for the next race, the , and his team was fined for instructing him to stay on track after the damage occurred. In Malaysia he qualified in third position, but was demoted down to 13th due to his ten-place <b>grid</b> drop. He <b>spun</b> out of the race while eighth, just before the race was stopped due to adverse weather conditions. However, in China he went on to take pole position, the first for the Red Bull Racing team. He went on to win the race ahead of teammate Mark Webber, again a first for his team, which scored its first victory and one-two finish in the same race. At the age of 21 years and 287 days, Vettel became the youngest Grand Prix driver in history to win for two different teams, having won the 2008 Italian Grand Prix for the Toro Rosso team.|$|R
40|$|Magnetic Nanoparticles Imaging (MNI) {{is a new}} {{imaging method}} which uses {{magnetic}} nanoparticles as the contrast agent. The superparamagnetism of ferro- and ferrimaterial allowed the particles {{to act as a}} temporary magnet when an external excitation is applied. The imaging is based on the reconstruction of the measured relaxation time (magnetorelaxometry) from the sample by SQUID sensors after the applied field is switched off. To date, the imaging method is still not applicable on human due to many undetermined parameters of the diagnostic configuration. The equation of the reconstruction is generally ill-posed due to the involvement of many parameters in the configuration. Hence, the optimization is required in order to eliminate the unstable parameters of this imaging technique. In this thesis, the study of excitation coils’ configuration has been conducted with manipulation of the number coils, arrangement of coils, diameter of coils and the shape of coils. The results show that by increasing the number of coils will improve the correlation coefficient of the reconstruction. However, due to the limitation of the grid size, the size of the coils is another concerned criterion; hence, the total area of the <b>coils</b> in each <b>grid</b> must be smaller than the area of the grid. The correlation coefficients of the reconstruction with varying the coils diameters show an improvement with smaller coils diameter. This observation obeyed the algorithm of diameter optimization in this thesis. Besides, the examinations of the arrangement and shape of coils show that both these criteria are highly depending on the shape of the sample. Due {{to the size of the}} rectangular coils used in the simulation are basically larger than the circular coils, hence, better results are found in the circular coils. On the other hand, the examination of the possibility of applying particle swarm optimization (PSO) method on the coils diameter has been studied by constructing the algorithm of the magnetic field calculation. The results of the algorithm construction showed that the diameter element is a non-linear parameter, and it is not suitable to be used in PSO as this method only applicable for the element which poses a linear relationship between the element and the output of optimizatio...|$|R
