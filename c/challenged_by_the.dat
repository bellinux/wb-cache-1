On December 4, 1966, Toronto Maple Leafs' defenceman Marcel Pronovost checked him into the boards, injuring Orr's knees {{for the first time}} in the NHL. He would miss nine games and the Bruins would lose six of them. The team finished with a 17–43–10 record, leaving the Bruins in last place. However, attendance at Boston Garden increased by forty-one thousand fans.|$|E
5|$|It also greatly {{extended}} {{the powers of}} Parliament. Under this new constitution, monarchical absolutism was replaced by parliamentary supremacy. It was quickly realised that Magna Carta stood in the same relation to the King-in-Parliament as it had to the King without Parliament. This supremacy would be <b>challenged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> likes of Granville Sharp. Sharp regarded Magna Carta as a fundamental part of the constitution, and maintained {{that it would be}} treason to repeal any part of it. He also held that the Charter prohibited slavery.|$|E

The U.S. had supplied F-16 Fighting Falcons to Pakistan on the condition they were kept at a Pakistani military base under 24-hour U.S. surveillance.|$|E

5|$|Sue's {{position}} as {{coach of the}} Cheerios is <b>challenged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> synchronized swim coach, Roz Washington (NeNe Leakes). Roz is also pursuing the tenured position, and she views herself as a serious competitor for tenure and for replacing Sue on the Cheerios. She believes Sue's coaching style and cheerleading choreography is old-fashioned, and plans to update the team if she becomes the new coach.|$|E
5|$|The {{authority}} of the Byzantine emperor as the legitimate Roman emperor was <b>challenged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> coronation of Charlemagne as Imperator Augustus by Pope Leo III in the year 800.

5|$|The {{change in}} control {{was not without}} dispute, however, with both Vale Royal Abbey and St Peter's Abbey, Gloucester {{claiming}} the valuable church advowson.

Vale Royal found keeping the appropriated church difficult, with the locals being at times difficult (for reasons that were not hard to discover).|$|E

Analysing the historic context and architectural style of the complex, the conclusion is that the creators are most likely local Javanese. The absence of any mention of European involvement in the construction of Taman Sari in Dutch historic descriptions is presented as further evidence in support of this hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally Luffa is held to {{have begun}} the {{building}} of Chichester Cathedral, the eastern section of which was dedicated in 1108. However, this view has been <b>challenged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> art historian R. D. H.

Most historians still incline to the belief that Luffa began the cathedral construction, however.|$|E

He broke peace with the Livonian Order in 1261, possibly renouncing Christianity, and was assassinated in 1263 by his nephew Treniota and another rival, Duke Daumantas. His three immediate successors were assassinated as well. The disorder was not resolved until Traidenis gained the title of Grand Duke c. 1270.|$|E

5|$|After {{their first}} {{victory of the}} season, the Flyers were <b>challenged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Muncie Offers More AC. The game was {{labelled}} as the Muncie City Championship. Since {{most of the other}} local teams' seasons were finished, both Muncie teams hired as many as 20 players for the game. The field was muddy, which caused Offers More AC to fumble the ball several times. In the third quarter, the Flyers scored two touchdowns to give them a 14–0 lead going into the fourth quarter. The Flyers added 10 more points—a touchdown and a field goal—in the final quarter to win the Championship 24–0.|$|E
5|$|As {{one of the}} two {{principal}} common law courts along with the Common Pleas, the King's Bench's jurisdiction and caseload was significantly <b>challenged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> rise of the Court of Chancery and equitable doctrines in the 15th and 16th centuries. To recover, the King's Bench undertook a scheme of revolutionary reform, creating less expensive, faster and more versatile types of pleading in the form of bills as opposed to the more traditional writs. Although not immediately stemming the tide, in the long term it helped the King's Bench not only recover but increase its workload. While there was a steep decline in business from 1460 to 1540, as the new reforms began to take effect the King's Bench's business was significantly boosted; between 1560 and 1640, it rose tenfold.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the war, most commanders thought enemy tanks should be met by tanks with {{superior}} specifications. This idea was <b>challenged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour, and German doctrine of avoiding tank-versus-tank combat. This, along with Germany's use of combined arms, were among the key elements of their highly successful blitzkrieg tactics across Poland and France. Many means of destroying tanks, including indirect artillery, anti-tank guns (both towed and self-propelled), mines, short-ranged infantry antitank weapons, and other tanks were used. Even with large-scale mechanisation, infantry remained the backbone of all forces, and throughout the war, most infantry were equipped similarly to World WarI.|$|E

5|$|In 1796 British Royal Navy {{dominance}} in the East Indies during the French Revolutionary Wars was <b>challenged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> arrival of a squadron of six French Navy frigates, commanded by Contre-amiral Pierre César Charles de Sercey. Among these ships was the new 40-gun frigate Preneuse, commanded by Captain Jean-Matthieu-Adrien Lhermitte. Preneuse had not sailed from France with Sercey, instead passing independently through the Atlantic and uniting with the squadron at Port Louis on Île de France. Sercey deployed his squadron to the Dutch East Indies, but suffered frustration at the Action of 9 September 1796 and the Bali Strait Incident of January 1797 and subsequently returned to the base at Port Louis. There the squadron began to fracture, with a succession of ships sent back to France or detached on independent missions.|$|E
5|$|Jeffrey Jowell proposes two {{justifications}} for limiting parliamentary sovereignty: legitimacy {{and the current}} hypothesis of constitutionalism. The argument from legitimacy highlights that Parliament's supremacy depends on the democratic and accountable nature of legislature; anything that undermines this status would invalidate {{the applicability of the}} doctrine. Jowell suggests that this view was expressly supported by Lord Hope and impliedly supported in other opinions that legislation limiting Parliament's accountability would be <b>challenged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> judiciary. The argument based on the current hypothesis of constitutionalism reasons that no authority should be allowed to violate fundamental rights in a democratic society: they are essential features that cannot be removed, even by a supposedly sovereign Parliament. This view was also expressly endorsed in Jackson by Lord Hope, who regarded Parliament's sovereignty as subject to the rule of law.|$|E
5|$|The lack of old native {{names for}} {{it has been}} used to {{demonstrate}} its absence in Britain before introduction in around 1487, but this is <b>challenged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> presence of an old Scottish Gaelic name for the tree, fior chrann which suggests a longer presence in Scotland at least {{as far back as the}} Gaelic settlement at Dál Riata in the late 6th and early 7th centuries. This would make it either an archaeophyte (a naturalised tree introduced by humans before 1500) or perhaps native if it can be seen to have reached Scotland without human intervention. At the moment it is usually classified as a neophyte, a plant that is naturalised but arrived with humans on or after the year 1500. Today, the sycamore is present in 3,461 (89.7%) of hectads in Britain, more than any native tree species.|$|E
