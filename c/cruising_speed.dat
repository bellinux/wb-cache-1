5|$|The Comet 4 was {{a further}} {{improvement}} on the stretched Comet 3 with even greater fuel capacity. The design had progressed {{significantly from the}} original Comet 1, growing by 18ft 6in (5.64m) and typically seating 74 to 81 passengers compared to the Comet 1's 36 to 44 (119 passengers could be accommodated in a special charter seating package in the later 4C series). The Comet 4 was considered the definitive series, having a longer range, higher <b>cruising</b> <b>speed</b> and higher maximum takeoff weight. These improvements were possible largely because of Avon engines with twice {{the thrust of the}} Comet 1's Ghosts. Deliveries to BOAC began on 30 September 1958 with two 48-seat aircraft, which were used to initiate the first scheduled transatlantic services.|$|E
5|$|A {{batch of}} 10 were {{produced}} and five were built from existing H-6s. The machines {{were joined by}} a center wing formed by two sections 6.15m (20ft) in length. The powerplants were five Junkers Jumo 211F engines producing 1,000kW (1,340hp) each. The total fuel capacity was 8,570L (2,260US gal). This was increased by adding of four 600L (160US gal) drop tanks. The He111Z could tow a Gotha Go 242 glider or Me 321 for up to 10 hours at <b>cruising</b> <b>speed.</b> It could also remain airborne if the three central powerplants failed. The He 111Z-2 and Z-3 were also planned as heavy bombers carrying 1,800kg (3,970lb) of bombs and having a range of 4,000km (2,500mi). The ETC installations allowed for a further four 600L (160US gal) drop tanks to be installed.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} a coupled {{longitudinal}} and lateral control strategy for an autonomous automotive vehicle is proposed. The proposed control scheme {{consists of a}} lateral guidance module based on a NonLinear Model-based Predictive Controller (NLMPC) and a <b>cruise</b> <b>speed</b> generation and regulation module. A cruise speed-profile generator allows the calculation of the <b>cruise</b> <b>speed</b> which preserves the lateral stability of the vehicle during lateral maneuvers. The calculation of the <b>cruise</b> <b>speed</b> profile is done considering road geometry as well as lateral dynamics criteria. The handling of both longitudinal and lateral dynamics {{in addition to the}} calculation of the limit <b>cruise</b> <b>speed</b> profile by considering lateral stability criteria illustrate the interest of the proposed approach.

5|$|The third mass {{production}} {{model of the}} He 111H was the H-16, entering production in late 1942. Armament was as on the H-11, with some differences. The 20mm MG FF cannon was deleted, as the H-16s were seldom employed on low-level missions, was replaced with a single MG 131 in a flexible installation in the nose (A-Stand). On some aircraft, designated He 111H-16/R1, the dorsal position {{was replaced by a}} Drehlafette DL 131 electrically powered turret, armed with a single MG 131. The two beam and the aft ventral positions were provided with MG 81Zs, as on the H-11. The two 1,000kW (1,340hp) Jumo 211 F-2 provided a maximum speed of 434km/h (270mph) at 6,000m (19,690ft); <b>cruising</b> <b>speed</b> was 390km/h (242mph), service ceiling was 8,500m (27,900ft).Funkgerät (FuG) radio equipment. FuG 10P, FuG 16, FuBl Z and APZ 6 were fitted for communication and navigation at night, while some aircraft received the FuG 101a radio altimeter. The H-16 retained its eight ESAC internal bomb cells; four bomb cells, as on previous versions could be replaced by a fuel tank to increase range. ETC 2000 racks could be installed over the bomb cell openings for external weapons carriage. Empty weight was 6,900kg (15,210lb) and the aircraft weighed 14,000kg (30,860lb) fully loaded for take off. German factories built 1,155 H-16s between the end of 1942 and the end of 1943; in addition, 280 H-6s and 35 H-11s were updated to H-16 standard. An undetermined number of H variants were fitted with the FuG 200 Hohentwiel. The radar was adapted as an anti-shipping detector for day or night operations.|$|E
25|$|Training {{missions}} {{were typically}} in two parts; first, a 40-hour flight—followed by {{some time on}} the ground for refueling and maintenance—then a 24-hour second flight. With a sufficiently light load, the B-36 could fly at least 10,000mi (16,000km) nonstop, and the highest <b>cruising</b> <b>speed</b> of any version, the B-36J-III, was at 230mph (380km/h). Engaging the jet engines could raise the <b>cruising</b> <b>speed</b> to over 400mph (650km/h). Hence a 40-hour mission, with the jets used only for takeoff and climbing, flew about 9,200mi (15,000km).|$|E

25|$|In 1994, Judy Massare {{concluded}} that ichthyosaurs {{had been the}} fastest marine reptiles. Their length/depth ratio was between three and five, the optimal number to minimise water resistance or drag. Their smooth skin and streamlined bodies prevented excessive turbulence. Their hydrodynamic efficiency, {{the degree to which}} energy is converted into a forward movement, would approach that of dolphins and measure about 0.8. Ichthyosaurs would be a fifth faster than plesiosaurs, though half of the difference was explained by assuming a 30% higher metabolism for ichthyosaurs. Together, within Massare's model these effects resulted in a <b>cruising</b> <b>speed</b> of slightly less than five kilometres per hour. However, in 2002, Motani corrected certain mistakes in Massare's formulae and revised the estimated <b>cruising</b> <b>speed</b> to less than two kilometres per hour, somewhat below that of modern Cetacea. However, as the speeds estimated for plesiosaurs and mosasaurids were also revised downwards, ichthyosaurs maintained their relative position.|$|E

25|$|The faster {{a vessel}} travels, the more energy it uses. Reaching high speed {{requires}} energy which a human-powered vessel {{is incapable of}} producing. Oar system generate very low amounts of energy for propulsion (only about 70 W per rower) and the upper limit for rowing in a fixed position is around 10 knots. Ancient war galleys of the kind used in Classical Greece are by modern historians {{considered to be the}} most energy efficient and fastest of galley designs throughout history. A full-scale replica of a 5th-century BC trireme, the Olympias was built 1985–87 and was put through a series of trials to test its performance. It proved that a <b>cruising</b> <b>speed</b> of 7-8 knots could be maintained for an entire day.
