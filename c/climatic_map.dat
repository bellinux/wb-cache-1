Suggested methodology improves the spatial resolution quality of the derived climatic data and contains the steps that show how climatic surfaces can be established in geographic information system (GIS) environment. For this purpose, total 570 points (sites) were established with 0. 01 decimal degree (~ 1000 m) grid intervals on the map of study area. Then, climatic variables (temperature, precipitation and potential evapotranspiration) of each point was derived by using LOCCLIM and (user defined) digital elevation model (DEM) with 1 / 25000 scale. Finally, <b>climatic</b> <b>maps</b> were developed by using derived point data and Inverse Distance Weighted Average (IDWA) method in GIS. To test the developed <b>climatic</b> surface <b>maps,</b> linear regression analyses were conducted with the original climatic data. Additional climatic surfaces were produced by using regression equations, DEM and map calculation functions of GIS. All developed <b>climatic</b> <b>maps</b> originated from LOCCLIM were subtracted from the corresponding regressed surface maps. The differences were found low for temperature variables, when some great differences were detected for the other climatic variables.

It can help urban planners, architects and governors to understand and evaluate the effect of urban climatic issues on decision-making and environment control. This paper reviews the progress of UCMap studies in the world. Firstly, the concept and structure of UCMap system are explained. Secondly, the history of UCMap as {{an important part of}} applied urban climatology is reviewed from the 1970 s to nowadays. German national guideline of VDI 3787 part 1 as a milestone of the UCMap study is also reviewed. Then, two selected UCMap studies from German and Japan are compared and summarized through the case study.

In the age of climate change, designing for quality environmental living conditions and sustainability is a topical concern.   However, on the one hand, designers and city planners operate with their three dimensional city morphological data such as building shapes and volumes, forms and their spacings, and functional attributes and definition signatures.  On the other hand, urban climatologists operate with their numbers and equations, quantities and signals, and normals and anomalies.  Traditionally the two camps do not meet.

For this, site index equations by ecoprovinces were first developed using environmental factors. Using the large data set from both a digital forest site map and a <b>climatic</b> <b>map,</b> a total of 48 environmental factors including 19 climatic variables were regressed on site index to develop site index equations. Two climate change scenarios, RCP 4. 5 and RCP 8. 5, were then applied to the developed site index equations and the distribution of productive areas for pinus densiflora were predicted from 2020 to 2100 years in 10 -year intervals. The results from this study show that the distribution of productive areas for pinus densiflora generally decreases as time passes.

40|$|This work {{joins the}} assets of two {{different}} classification procedures for National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA AVHRR) data. The first procedure presented by Rodríguez Yi et al. (2000) was based on image segmentation following supervised classification by regions. Eight vegetation classes were identified using this procedure. A Kappa coefficient of 0. 4 indicated that image segmentation associated to supervised classification by regions is a procedure that is useful for mapping vegetation classes on a regional scale. SPRING software was used to perform image segmentation and supervised classification using AVHRR channel 1 and 2 mosaics. Prior to image segmentation (region growing algorithm), the histograms of these channels were equalized to avoid a preference for a channel with large variance. The best segmentation treshold values for area and similarity were 2 and 25, respectively. Supervised classification by regions {{was based on the}} Bhattacharrya distance with a threshold of 95 for correct classification. Twelve Landsat images together with field information were used as ancillary data to support the training sample selection in the supervised classification procedure. The second procedure presented by Durieux et al. (2000) was based on fuzzy logic classification of multisource data and NOAA-AVHRR images. This methodology used jointly overlay operations, multiple criteria analysis methods and fuzzy procedure. Vegetation classification was based on the biogeographical analysis of relationships between geographical data and vegetation distribution associated to remote sensing information given by the spectral response of each vegetation type. Multi-source data were associated to expert knowledge using a fuzzy ponderation. Resulting maps described the potentiality of each vegetation class to be present in a pixel in relation with the considered criterion. Fusions of possibility distribution for each vegetation class were done using a new individualized method. Finally a maximum operator was used to discriminate vegetation class potentialities in the final integration. The main characteristics of this method were the use of possibility theory to handle imprecision due to pixel classification, and the ability to merge numerical sources (satellite image spectral bands, <b>climatic</b> <b>map,</b> DEM, soil map) and symbolic sources (expert knowledge about best localization of classes). Nine vegetation classes were mapped: Woodland Savanna, Tree Savanna, Parkland Savanna, Dense Evergreen Forest, Open Evergreen Forest, Seasonal Forest, Transition OE, Transition SF, Transition T. This method showed limitation in correct vegetation classes discrimination (Kappa coefficient < 0. 4) but globally respected the forest-savanna transition. Results are not significantly {{different from those of the}} first procedure while being much more reproducible, faster and cheaper. Here the supervised classification by regions will be replaced by a simple classification by regions to limit ground data collection. Both procedures will be applied for vegetation classification of Mato Grosso state, Brazil The joint procedure will be applied to channel 1 (0. 58 - 0. 68 mm) and channel 2 (0. 72 - 1. 1 mm) AVHRR mosaics composed of images acquired between 13 and 26 june 1993 and multisource biogeographical data used for fuzzy classification including deforestation, soil and climate data as well as elevation information. All data are stored and processed using the GIS SPRING 3. 4 developed by INPE (INPE, 2000). The results of the classification will be compared with the result obtained by the two original procedures independently and validated using an existing map of vegetation of Mato Grosso state (PRODEAGRO, 1997) using Kappa statistics. We are expecting that the results will benefit of the quality of NOAA_AVHRR segmentation by region and of the rapidity and low cost of the fuzzy procedure. The high diversity of vegetation physiognomy encountered in Mato Grosso State is representative of the forest- avanna transition in Brazil. This joint methodology could be used for vegetation mapping of the entire South Amazonian arc of deforestation in association with existing deforestation data to provide an homogeneous vegetation database for this region.

Nine geographical and two climatic indicators are computed at city block scale. Thegeographical ones are produced thanks to OrbisGIS platform from geographical data supplied bythe French IGN.

Wetlands in the north eastern and southern slopes of the Mount Cameroon region are plagued by two categories of threats (stressors) which are of natural and anthropogenic origin.
