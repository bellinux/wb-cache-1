40|$|The solar {{backscattered}} ultraviolet spectral radiometer on the Nimbus 7 satellite provides {{a unique set of}} radiation measurements which allows an evaluation of the spectral albedo of the earth and its atmosphere in the wavelength range 300 to 340 nm. Near 340 nm, the derived spectral albedo expressed as a function of latitude and month exceeds that in the visible part of the spectrum, with values near 45 percent existing equatorward of 30 deg and an increase to 60 - 80 percent toward the poles. At middle to high latitudes, the monthly mean spectral albedo exceeds the contribution from Rayleigh scattering alone by factors of 1. 4 to 2. 2. At wavelengths from 300 to 310 nm, where absorption by stratospheric ozone is significant, the daylight averaged spectral albedos receive negligible contribution from scattering by tropospheric clouds, yet the derived values exceed those predicted for Rayleigh scattering from a <b>clean</b> <b>stratosphere.</b> These observations are consistent with the presence of an atmospheric scattering layer, distinct from cloudiness, located at an altitude above the tropopause...|$|E
40|$|Aerosol {{optical depth}} (AOD) has been {{measured}} at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) central facility near Lamont, Oklahoma, {{since the fall of}} 1992. Most of the data presented are from the multi-filter rotating shadowband radiometer, a narrow-band, interferencefilter sunradiometer with five aerosol bands in the visible and near infrared, however, AOD measurements have been made simultaneously and routinely at the site by as many as three different types of instruments including two pointing sunradiometers. Scatterplots indicate high correlations and small biases consistent with earlier comparisons. The early part of this 16 -year record had a disturbed stratosphere with residual Mt. Pinatubo aerosols, followed by the <b>cleanest</b> <b>stratosphere</b> in decades. As such, the last 13 years of the record reflect changes that have occurred predominantly in the troposphere. The field calibration technique is briefly described and compared to Langley calibrations from Mauna Loa Observatory. A modified cloudscreening technique is introduced that increases the number of daily-averaged AODs retrieved annually to about 250 days compared to 175 days when a more conservative method was employed in earlier studies. AODs are calculated when the air mass is less than six, i. e., when the sun’s elevation is greater than 9. 25 º. The more inclusive cloud-screen and the use of most of the daylight hours yield a data set {{that can be used to}} more faithfully represent the true aerosol 1 climate for this site. The diurnal aerosol cycle is examined month-by-month to assess the effects of an aerosol climatology based on less frequent sampling such as that from satellites. 1...|$|R
