Among various RD systems, Turing-like (e. g., 2 -D striped or spotted) patterns emerging on animal skins, etc., have mainly {{been shown in}} ‘software ’ simulations of RD chemicals or physical wetware. In this work, we present a simple mathemat-ical model for a possible ‘hardware ’ RD system that produces Turing-like patterns, for image-processing applications. Based on Young’s digital RD model [2] that generates Turing-like pat-terns, the authors proposed analog-digital hybrid cellular automata for hard-ware RD systems (RD chips) [3]. In the model, linear diffusion systems of activators and inhibitors were employed, and they were electrically emulated by discrete <b>capacitor</b> <b>networks</b> in the hawdrare, which prevented us to design high-resolution RD silicon processors. In this work, we propose an improved model of [3] for completely-different but smart RD hardware architectures.

Two-layered 2 -D resistive sheets are employed for emulating chemical diffusions of activators and inhibitors, whereas nonlinear feedback devices (conventional amplifiers) are used for emulating interactions between the chemicals.

A {{wireless sensor network}} system requires very high energy and power efficiency which is difficult to achieve with traditional analog circuits. First, 5. 58 nW real time clock using a DLL (Delay Locked Loop) -assisted pulse-driven crystal oscillator is discussed. In this circuit, the operational amplifier used in the traditional circuit was replaced with pulsed drivers. The pulse was generated at precise timing by a DLL. The circuit parts operate in different supply levels, generated on chip by using a switched <b>capacitor</b> <b>network.</b> The circuit was tested at different supply voltage and temperature. Its frequency characteristic along with power consumption were measured and compared to the traditional circuit. Next, a Schmitt trigger based pulse-driven crystal oscillator is discussed. In the first chapter, a DLL was used to generate a pulse with precise timing. However, testing results and recent study showed that the crystal oscillator can sustain oscillation even with inaccurate pulse timing. In this chapter, pulse location {{is determined by the}} Schmitt trigger. Simulation results show that this structure can still sustain oscillation at different process corners and temperature. In the next chapter, a sub-nW 8 bit SAR ADC (Successive Approximation Analog-to-Digital Converter) using transistor-stack DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) is discussed. To facilitate design effort and reduce the layout dependent effect, a conventional capacitive DAC was replaced with transistor-stack DAC with a 255 : 1 multiplexer. The control logic was designed with both TSPC (True Single Phase Clock) and CMOS logic to minimize transistor count. The ADC was implemented in a 65 nm CMOS process and tested at different sampling rates and input signal frequency. Its linearity and power consumption was measured. Also, a similar design was implemented and tested using 180 nm CMOS process as part of a sensor node system.

[...] University of Washington, 1996 RLC (resistor, inductor, <b>capacitor)</b> <b>network</b> {{reduction}} {{refers to}} the formulation of small networks whose port behavior {{is similar to that}} of large RLC networks. The motivation for this research is that circuits are switching faster so that layout and package parasitics associated with very large scale integrated (VLSI) circuits become more important and require simulation before fabrication. Parasitic effects are often modeled using lumped linear RLC networks which are extracted from the geometry of the layout and package, but these networks are so large that subsequent simulation is impractical or impossible. As a result, it is necessary to reduce these networks after extraction and before simulation. Several network reduction algorithms have been developed in the last few years, but none exist which guarantee both accuracy and passivity (most guarantee only accuracy). If the reduced networks are not accurate then the results of the simulation will probably be wrong, but if the reduced networks are not passive then the subsequent simulation may not work at all.
