40|$|This report investigates how Thailand has {{translated}} the global norms of security sector reform (SSR) {{into its own}} local setting. The author offers a detailed overview of Thailand's security sector and its actors, assesses the military influence and analyzes the SSR attempts until the last putsch in 2014 and the efforts made since then. He shows that SSR approaches in Thailand do exist, {{but there is nothing}} about them which upholds the rule of law under elected civilian rule or the <b>civilian</b> <b>monitoring</b> of military institutions. He therefore names the attempts made 'security sector deforms' instead of 'reforms'. The author argues that true SSR leading to institutionalized civilian control will only come to Thailand from within, when the current junta's image becomes increasingly tarnished, when traditional elite institutions reject supporting military rule, and when Thai people from all functional backgrounds unite to prioritize SSR and deny military coup plotters the chance to ever usurp power again.

Sensor networks are composed of large number of densely deployed sensor nodes with limited energy and computation.

However the routing protocols using encryption schemes require large memory for storing the keys and more computation.

The performance of the proposed protocol has been evaluated and analysed in terms of delivery ratio for different number of nodes...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} {{a critical review}} of current state of development of European capacities {{in the domain of}} satellite based information for civil crisis response in Europe and worldwide. New global security challenges require new technological solutions to answer the <b>civilian</b> security <b>monitoring</b> tasks of an enlarged European Community, acting in a more globalised world. Different crisis types and patterns require different analysis and response capacities. Various initiatives and projects exist today, which work towards European satellite analysis capacities for civil security issues. Mechanisms like the International Charter ¿Space and Major Disasters¿, the EC initiative on Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) or the Group on Earth Observation Systems of Systems (GEOSS) provide a basis for forging and expanding such capacities. Today, especially the scientific community and research initiatives provide substantial information support and analytical capacities to member states and the bodies of the European Community. One very interesting and promising tool to further develop satellite intelligence for civil security issues through the conduct of coordinated analytical exercises in distributed research networks and thus to test strengths and weaknesses of {{the current state of the}} art technology and methods available. It can be concluded that the first elements of a European civil security analysis infrastructure are materializing; however, further efforts and coordination mechanisms are necessary to build respective operational and fully analytical and coherently acting capacities within Europe.

A key question in this regard is whether politics will prevent peacekeepers from exploiting recent advances in geospatial technology.

5|$|While {{approximately}} 35,000 Serb refugees, trapped {{with the}} surrendered ARSK Kordun Corps, were evacuated to Yugoslavia via Sisak and the ZagrebBelgrade motorway, {{the bulk of}} the refugees followed a route through the Republika Srpska, arriving there via Dvor in Banovina or via Srb in Likatwo corridors to Serb-held territory in Bosnia and Herzegovina left as the HV advanced. The two points of retreat were created {{as a consequence of the}} delay of a northward advance of the HV Split Corps after the capture of Knin, and the decision not to use the entire HV 2nd Guards Brigade to spearhead the southward advance from Petrinja. The retreating ARSK, transporting large quantities of weaponry, ammunition, artillery and tanks, often intermingled with evacuating or fleeing civilians, had few roads to use. The escaping columns were reportedly intermittently attacked by CAF jets, and the HV, trading fire with the ARSK located close to the civilian columns. The refugees were also targeted by ARBiH troops, as well as by VRS jets, and sometimes were run over by the ARSK Special Units Corps' retreating tanks. On 9 August, a refugee convoy evacuating from the former Sector North under the terms of the ARSK Kordun Corps' surrender agreement was attacked by Croatian civilians in Sisak. The attack caused one civilian death, many injuries and damage to a large number of vehicles. Croatian police intervened in the incident after UN <b>civilian</b> police <b>monitors</b> pressured them to do so. The next day, US ambassador Galbraith joined the column to protect them, and the Croatian police presence along the planned route increased. The refugees moving through the Republika Srpska were extorted at checkpoints and forced to pay extra for fuel and other services by local strongmen.|$|R
