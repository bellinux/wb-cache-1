East Ayrshire Council, who originally gave £5000 to fund the project, refused to give further finance, stating that it didn't feel it would contribute to the <b>community.</b> <b>Producer,</b> Broughan, called the decision [...] "a disgrace". It took three years for the project to get back on track. Broughan was joined by producer Damita Nikapota on the project who secured pre-production finance from Freewheel Productions.

40|$|Introduction Producer {{services}} {{providers are}} firms that sell services {{primarily to the}} business community rather than to individuals and households. Accounting firms, consultants, and computer design services are prominent examples of producer services businesses. Given their importance as suppliers to the broader business <b>community,</b> <b>producer</b> services are a critical segment of the economy. Many producer services industries also are a rapidly growing and pay high wages. The producer services sectors in fact are the principal source of high wage job growth in our evolving service economy. For all of these reasons, this article highlights {{the performance of the}} producer services sector in Nebraska. In particular, we examine the growth in producer services in the nation and in Nebraska in the last decade, and explore whether or not the state of Nebraska has captured a significant share of employment in producer services.

40|$|Using {{survey data}} from the <b>community,</b> <b>producer</b> {{marketing}} groups (PMGs) and farm households in Kenya, this paper investigates the potential of rural institutions (farmer organizations, their rules and enforcement mechanisms) for remedying pervasive market imperfections and facilitate access to new technology in rural areas. Qualitative and quantitative analyses show that while the functioning of markets is constrained by high transaction costs and coordination failures, PMGs present new opportunities for small producers through vertical and horizontal coordination of production and grain marketing. They pay 20 to 25 % higher prices than other buyers and facilitate the adoption of improved varieties that help increase marketable surplus. Their accumulated assets and traded volumes are influenced by participatory decision making, member contributions and initial start-up capital. While participation declines with farm size, the associated benefits depend on marketed amounts. Moreover, the time lag to payment for deliveries makes PMGs less attractive marketing channels for the poor. The success of such groups requires policy support, increased capital access, rural finance and market information.

40|$|Abantu, a {{word meaning}} 'people' in several African languages, {{is the focus}} and the key {{resource}} of this 1990 s style NGO. Abantu for Development was created in 1991 {{with the aim of}} empowering the African people, women in particular, to control and manage their own resources and organisations. A southern organisation with a northern base, Abantu for Development prides itself on being a mould breaker. The skills and network experience of Abantu for Development could be useful to many Spore readers active in gender issues and associated areas, particularly among the rapidly growing number of local <b>community,</b> <b>producer,</b> and consumer organisations related to agriculture and rural development. Abantu for Development provides training opportunities through a participatory approach in the areas of gender and poverty, gender and conflict, gender and governance, and gender and information technology. Their interest in information and communication technologies (ICTs) is widely known, partly through a key training programme on strengthening the capacity of women's organisations in ICT, which was held in 1998 in Nairobi, Kenya. Publications available from Abantu for Development include a quarterly magazine GAP Matters, where GAP stands for 'gender and policies'. It looks in particular at the gap between rhetoric and reality in the integration of gender issues in all aspects of development. Other publications deal with the development of African women's organisations in civil society through the use of ICTs; effective communication and public relations strategies; and African women and governance. There is a growing awareness in the agriculture and rural development community of the importance of making gender a mainstream-perhaps even essential-theme in agricultural strategies and practice. An exposure to Abantu for Development could provide the encouragement and the tools to 'genderise' your institution. They will not sweep you off your feet perhaps, since Spore readers (7 % of them women, but growing) are known to keep their feet on the ground. But Abantu's people promise you their skills, their resources, and their motto: Lifting others as we climb.

40|$|Herbivorous {{top-down}} {{forces and}} bottom-up competition for nutrients determine the coexistence and relative biomass patterns of producer species. Combining models of predator–prey and producer–nutrient interactions with a structural model of complex food webs, I investigated these two aspects in a dynamic food-web model. While competitive exclusion leads to persistence {{of only one}} producer species in 99. 7 % of the simulated simple <b>producer</b> <b>communities</b> without consumers, embedding the same <b>producer</b> <b>communities</b> in complex food webs generally yields producer coexistence. In simple <b>producer</b> <b>communities,</b> the <b>producers</b> with the most efficient nutrient-intake rates increase in biomass until they competitively exclude inferior producers. In food webs, herbivory predominantly reduces the biomass density of those producers that dominated in <b>producer</b> <b>communities,</b> which yields a more even biomass distribution. In contrast to prior analyses of simple modules, this facilitation of producer coexistence by herbivory {{does not require a}} trade-off between the nutrient-intake efficiency and the resistance to herbivory. The local network structure of food webs (top-down effects of the number of herbivores and the herbivores' maximum consumption rates) and the nutrient supply (bottom-up effect) interactively determine the relative biomass densities of the producer species. A strong negative feedback loop emerges in food webs: factors that increase producer biomasses also increase herbivory, which reduces producer biomasses. This negative feedback loop regulates the coexistence and biomass patterns of the producers by balancing biomass increases of producers and biomass fluxes to herbivores, which prevents competitive exclusion...|$|R
