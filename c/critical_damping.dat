The behavior of semi-active devices is often highly non-linear and requires suitable and efficient control algorithm. This paper presents the comparative study and performance of variable semi-active friction dampers by using recently proposed predictive control law with direct output feedback. In this control law, the variable slip force of semi-active variable friction damper is kept slightly lower than the critical friction force, which allows the damper to remain in the slip state during an earthquake, resulting in improved energy dissipation capability. This control algorithm is able to produce a continuous and smooth slip forces for a variable friction damper. The numerical examples include a structure controlled with multiple variable semi-active friction dampers and with multiple passive friction dampers. A parameter, gain multiplier defined as the ratio of <b>damper</b> force to <b>critical</b> <b>damper</b> control force, is investigated under four different real earthquake ground motions, which plays an important role in the present control algorithm of the damper.

40|$|The {{problem of}} the {{oscillation}} of an incompressible fluid in an open-ended U-tube is frequently discussed in the textbooks of hydraulics, vibrations and automatic control systems etc., but their theoretical equations cannot explain the experimental results. On the other hand, many theoretical and experimental studies different from the statements in usual textbooks have been taken until now. However, {{it does not seem}} that the definite and final solution of this problem has been given. So a new attempt is presented here. 　In this paper, the momentum equations of the fluid column are established by applying the Navier-Stokes equation, and they are solved by applications of the Laplace transform. These solutions give the following results. 　 1. The free oscillation of the fluid in the U-tube {{can be explained by the}} Reynolds number /ν (put=W), where a is the internal radius of the U-tube, ν is the kinematic viscocity and ω_o =√ (g is the acceleration due to the gravity and l is the length of the fluid column). 　 2 If W= 3. 435075 (put = W_c), the free oscillation of the fluid in the U-tube is <b>critical</b> <b>damped</b> and if W W_c, it is underda mped. 　 3 In the case of W > W_c, the free osclliation of the fluid in the U-tube consists of a fundamental underdamped motion and innumerable overdamped motions. But if we take the motion on and after decimal nine times as much as the period of the motion, the innumerable overdamped motions can be neglected and the motion can be regarded as a solution of the following second order differential equation with constant coefficients:　x + 2 ζω_nx + ω_n^ 2 x = 0 　The damping factor ζ and the undamped natural frequency η (=ω_n/ω_ 0) with respect to the dimensionless time ω_ 0 t are given as follows:　ζ = cos(arg.

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this paper investigates the possibility of precise experimental identification of steady damper characteristics. The paper considers velocity sensitive and nominally symmetric hydraulic dampers. The proposed identification methodology is based on a piecewise constant velocity excitation. One goal of the paper is to analyze the transient nature of the damper response in the context of finite permissible piston displacements and first order transient effects due to elastic elements in the damper structure. The proposed methodology is formalized in a framework suitable for experimental design, allowing the detailed study of steady state damper performance. The second goal of the paper is to demonstrate the practical application of the proposed methodology.

40|$|Cell surface-exposed calreticulin (ecto-CRT) and {{secreted}} ATP {{are crucial}} damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) for immunogenic apoptosis. Here, immunogenic apoptosis {{is a type}} of cancer cell death subroutine which is apoptotic in nature but accompanied by enhanced immunogenicity as opposed to immunosuppression or tolerogenicity which accompanies the normal physiological apoptosis. DAMPs, which {{play an important role in}} mediating this enhanced immunogenicity, are molecules that are normally hidden within live cells (where they perform pre-dominantly non-immunological functions) however they tend to acquire immunomodulatory functions once secreted/surface exposed by dying/stressed/damaged cells. Previously described inducers of immunogenic apoptosis (certain chemotherapeutics) relied on an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) -based (reactive oxygen species (ROS) -regulated) pathway for DAMP exposure/secretion. However, these inducers caused immunogenic apoptosis through an off target effect thereby making the resultant immunogenicity secondary in character and prone to tumour/cancer microevolution-based resistance. During my PhD research, we found that after hypericin-based photodynamic therapy (Hyp-PDT), which generates on target ROS-mediated ER stress, dying cancer cells undergo bona fide immunogenic apoptosis characterized by phenotypic maturation and functional stimulation of (human) dendritic cells (DCs) as well as induction of a protective anti-tumour immune response, in vivo. Intriguingly, early after Hyp-PDT the cancer cells displayed ecto-CRT and secreted ATP through overlapping PERK-orchestrated pathways that required a functional secretory pathway and phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) p 110 alfa-mediated plasma membrane/extracellular trafficking. Interestingly, eIF 2 alfa phosphorylation and caspase- 8 signalling which were important for chemotherapeutics-induced ecto-CRT were dispensable for Hyp-PDT induced ecto-CRT. Moreover, we found that Hyp-PDT induced ecto-CRT (in contrast to chemotherapy-induced ecto-CRT) was ERp 57 -independent. We also identified LRP 1 as the surface docking site for ecto-CRT and found that depletion of PERK, PI 3 K p 110 alfa and LRP 1 but not caspase- 8 reduced the immunogenicity of the cancer cells. These results unravelled a novel PERK-dependent subroutine for the early and simultaneous emission of two <b>critical</b> <b>DAMPs</b> during Hyp-PDT induced on target immunogenic apoptosis. Thus, research done during my PhD has shown that there is a great need to increase the awareness (amongst patients and oncologists) that it is possible for the immunogenicity of a dying cancer/tumour cell to be accentuated to cause instigation of potent anti-tumour immunity if a proper therapy like Hyp-PDT is used; a message that has important socio-economic relevance. In terms of a practical implementation, the research done during my PhD can help in efficient Hyp-PDT based production of autologous anti-cancer DC vaccines against cancers like glioblastoma and melanoma. Moreover, for the preparation of autologous anti-cancer DC vaccines, Hyp-PDT has a higher probability of overcoming various immunogenicity resistance mechanisms (e. g. caspase- 8 ablation based) employed by tumours than currently characterized chemotherapeutic inducers of immunogenicity. Hence, Hyp-PDT induced immunogenicity (if implemented clinically) promises to have better health economic implications. nrpages: 135 status: publishe...|$|R
