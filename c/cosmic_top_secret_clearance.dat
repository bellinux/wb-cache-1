Additionally, the SCI access granted by other intelligence agencies, such as CIA or NSA, do not transfer to DIA and vice versa.|$|R
50|$|The United States {{government}} classifies information {{according to}} the degree which the unauthorized disclosure would damage national security. Having <b>Top</b> <b>Secret</b> <b>clearance</b> does not allow one to view all <b>Top</b> <b>Secret</b> documents. The user of the information must possess the clearance necessary for {{the sensitivity of the}} information, as well as a legitimate need to obtain the information. For example, all US military pilots are required to obtain at least a <b>Secret</b> <b>clearance,</b> but they may only access documents directly related to their orders. Secret information might have additional access controls that could prevent someone with a <b>Top</b> <b>Secret</b> <b>clearance</b> from seeing it.|$|R
