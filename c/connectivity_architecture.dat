Specifically, we look at spectral responses to random fluctuations and examine the ability of synaptic gain and connectivity parameters to induce Turing instabilities. We find that although the spatial deployment and speed of lateral connections can have a profound affect on the behaviour of spatial modes over different scales, only synaptic gain is capable of producing phase-transitions.

Though clinically effective, IFN-α rapidly impairs mood, motivation and cognition, effects that can appear indistinguishable from major depression and provide powerful empirical support for the inflammation theory of depression. Though inflammation {{has been shown to}} modulate activity within discrete brain regions, how it affects distributed information processing and the architecture of whole brain functional connectivity networks have not previously been investigated. Here we use a graph theoretic analysis of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rfMRI) to investigate acute effects of systemic interferon-alpha (IFN-α) on whole brain functional <b>connectivity</b> <b>architecture</b> and its relationship to IFN-α-induced mood change. Twenty-two patients with Hepatitis-C infection, initiating IFN-α-based therapy were scanned at baseline and 4 h after their first IFN-α dose. The whole brain network was parcellated into 110 cortical and sub-cortical nodes based on the Oxford-Harvard Atlas and effects assessed on higher-level graph metrics, including node degree, betweenness centrality, global and local efficiency. IFN-α was associated with a significant reduction in global network connectivity (node degree) (p= 0. 033) and efficiency (p= 0. 013), indicating a global reduction of information transfer among the nodes forming the whole brain network. Effects were similar for highly connected (hub) and non-hub nodes, with no effect on betweenness centrality (p> 0. 1). At a local level, we identified regions with reduced efficiency of information exchange and a sub-network with decreased functional connectivity after IFN-α. Changes in local and particularly global functional connectivity correlated with associated changes in mood measured on the Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire. IFN-α rapidly induced a profound shift in whole brain network structure, impairing global functional connectivity and the efficiency of parallel information exchange.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{non-uniform}} cellular automata (CA), where cellular rules need not necessarily be identical, can be co-evolved to perform computational tasks. This paper extends these studies by gener-alizing on a second aspect of CAs, namely their standard, homogeneous connectivity. We study non-standard architectures, where each cell has a small, identical number of connections, yet not necessarily from its most immediate neighboring cells. We show that such architectures are compu-tationally more ecient than standard architectures in solving global tasks, and also provide the reasoning for this. It is shown that one can successfully evolve non-standard architectures through a two-level evolutionary process, in which the cellular rules evolve concomitantly with the cellular connec-tions. Speci cally, studying the global density task, we identify the average cellular distance as a prime architectural parameter determining cellular automata performance. We carry out a quantitative analysis of this relationship, our main results being: (1) Performance is linearly dependent on the average cellular distance, with a high correlation coecient. (2) High performance architectures can be co-evolved, concomitantly with the rules, and (3) Low connectivity cost can be obtained as well as high performance.

Providers compete both {{for business and}} final customers, while cooperating the exchanges of information flows composing the digital commodities, to provide a complete, end to end, service to final users. A myriad of interconnection decisions form the <b>connectivity's</b> <b>architecture</b> of this Global Supply Chain Network, designing {{the rules of the}} business game played by the operators. This paper, using a dataset of interconnection protocols over 195 Internet Exchange Points across the World, focuses on the relationship between a provider's connectivity and clustering: the mutual connectivity among the operators this provider is connected to. The strategic relevance of this relationship between connectivity and clustering is clear: the better connected a provider is, the easier it is to deliver the digital commodities with high quality and low costs and, when the neighbours of a provider are less interconnected among themselves, it is easier, for the provider, to exert its bargaining power over them. We estimate an econometric model finding that the continental location of an Internet Exchange Point has a significant effect on the sign of the elasticity between clustering and connectivity. This indicates that Local Supply Chain Networks display significant differences in their clusters of integration, hierarchical organization and complexity, depending on whether they are based in Europe, North America or Rest of the World...|$|R

The second and third papers are based on how SIM cards {{can be used to}} enhance the security of two different systems. Indeed, the second paper, ‘A USIM-based uniform access authentication framework in mobile communication’ by Li et al., proposes a uniform access authentication framework based on the EAP authentication protocol in order to add a media-independent authentication layer in USIM, along with a key adaptation layer (for terminals) which enables to meet the specific requirements of various communication modules. In the third paper, ‘CS-DRM: a cloud-based SIM DRM scheme for mobile internet’, Wang et al. introduce a SIM card into a Digital Rights Management (DRM) system to both reduce the cost of the servers in a DRM system when the number of users scales up and in turn provide higher security. The fourth and fifth papers relate to radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. In the fourth paper, ‘Who counterfeited my Viagra?’ Probabilistic item removal detection via RFID tag cooperation’, Conti et al. provide a set of probabilistic protocols that detect the absence of a RFID tag from a system composed of a set of tags and a reader. In the fifth paper, ‘A salient missing link in RFID security protocols’, Erguler et al. demonstrate how timing attacks can be achieved on some well-known lightweight RFID security protocols. The aims of this paper are to jeopardize the system's untraceability criteria and to outline a countermeasure by precisely describing the database query mechanism.

In case of advanced pairing, the novel approach to enhance RF 4 CE key agreement is presented according to these recent convergence trends. Our improved key agreement approach supports the mutual authentication using RF 4 CE device certification in order to resolve the threat of counterfeited or cloned devices. The quick mode of the proposed key seed distribution increases the possibility of the secure generation of a link encryption key against the disclosure to the third party and the DoS attack by providing the transmission of the selected key seeds. Key selection information is only shared between the paired nodes. The main mode solves the vulnerability of plaintext transmission through encrypting all transmitted seeds with different keys.|$|E
