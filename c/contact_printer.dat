50|$|Vincent Joseph Dunker (December 6, 1878 - March 11, 1974) was a photographer, {{inventor}} {{and camera}} manufacturer {{who began his}} career in Ste. Genevieve, Missouri in the late 1890s. Dunker built {{a wide variety of}} cameras, <b>contact</b> <b>printers,</b> photo enlargers, and photo booths over a period of thirty-seven years. In 1924 he began production of his specialty, long roll film cameras intended for taking photos of high school students for yearbooks and individual sale. By the time Dunker built his last camera in 1961 such annual school photography had become routine in high schools throughout the U.S.|$|R
50|$|Mikuláš Klaudyán (died 1522) was a {{physician}} and scholar in Mladá Boleslav, Bohemia {{and member of the}} Unity of the Brethren. He printed the oldest map of Bohemia (1518). He was in close <b>contact</b> with <b>printers</b> in Nürnberg.|$|R
50|$|Caslon {{was born}} in Cradley, Worcestershire in 1692 or 1693 and trained as an {{engraver}} in nearby Birmingham. In 1716, he started business in London as an engraver of gun locks and barrels and as a bookbinder's tool cutter. Having <b>contact</b> with <b>printers,</b> he was induced to fit up a type foundry, largely through the encouragement of William Bowyer.|$|R
50|$|The <b>contact</b> <b>printer</b> is used {{to expose}} the negative's image onto the paper for a few seconds, {{creating}} an invisible latent image on the paper. The operator may use a manual switch and count off the seconds himself, or he may use an electric timer switch.|$|E
50|$|A <b>contact</b> <b>printer,</b> the {{simplest}} exposure system, puts a photomask in {{direct contact with}} the wafer and exposes it to a uniform light. A proximity printer puts a small gap between the photomask and wafer. In both cases, the mask covers the entire wafer, and simultaneously patterns every die.|$|E
50|$|In 1926, Vincent {{filed for}} a patent on a <b>contact</b> <b>printer</b> that is {{somewhat}} similar in design to the many contact printers sold by Kodak in the 1930s and 1940s, but rather than making one contact print at a time, the Dunker printer was designed to use a long roll of contact paper inside along with strips of negatives {{on top of the}} printer to produce contact prints in a much more rapid manner than other contact printers of the time. His <b>contact</b> <b>printer</b> was sold throughout the United States as well as overseas. Dunker also designed and sold a photo booth of the type whereby direct prints could be made for customers in a few minutes and he manufactured at least three different models of photo enlargers.|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} of prints from ERTS photography revealed {{significant differences in}} the image quality produced at GSFC, the EROS facility at Sioux Falls, and Eastman Kodak in Rochester. Based on this survey photographic quality was improved significantly at Sioux Falls, and improvements were suggested for optical and <b>contact</b> <b>printers</b> at the GSFC. Based on a test in which 365 meters of Eastman Electron Recording Film (ESTAR Base) SO- 438 were processed the 1 -sigma variation in process control from all sources is about + or - 0. 04 at a density of 1. 0. Variations from film and from processing were approximately equal contributors to the overall tolerance. Distortion produced by the Kodak Colorado printer at GSFC covers a range of about 0. 04 %, a small value compared to that caused by other factors in the ERTS system. The edge fringing inherent in the color film materials used at GSFC also seems to be a small factor in the unsharpness of ERTS color prints. MTF and granularity measurements were made on processed film samples supplied by GSFC. MTF values were above 0. 70 out to 42 cycles/mm for all stages of contact printing in the ERTS system...|$|R
50|$|Skinner {{attempted}} {{to arrange for}} the posthumous printing and publication, outside England, of some of Milton's state papers, which were at the time unlikely to be publishable in England. In 1675, via Symon Heere, who is presumed to be a Dutch boat skipper, he <b>contacted</b> a <b>printer</b> in Amsterdam, Daniel Elzevir of the House of Elzevir, and {{attempted to}} have Elzevir publish Milton's Letters. However, Elzevir was reluctant to do so, and (as he later reported in a letter, dated 1676-11-20, to Sir Joseph Williamson, then Secretary of State) after he had received the manuscripts contacted Skinner in Cambridge {{to tell him that}} he was unwilling to publish them, given their contents. Elzevir had sent the manuscripts on for review by Philipp van Limborch, at the time a professor at Remonstrant College.|$|R
5000|$|Her first film, Spectrum Reverse Spectrum (2014), {{was made}} without {{use of a}} camera by exposing 70mm print stock to {{precisely}} calibrated colored light. Artforum critic Nick Pinkerton writes, [...] "Running {{the length of a}} single reel of wide-gauge stock, the film follows exactly the eponymous trajectory, chameleonically transitioning across the visible light spectrum, from violet to red and back again, beginning and ending in black. The simple effect, achieved using a <b>contact</b> film <b>printer,</b> is something like a prismatic sunset in a distant galaxy ..." [...] The feature-length Color Correction (2015) was made using the timing tapes that corrected the color for an unidentified Hollywood feature. Both films, along with Wildflowers (2015) (a film shot on expired Kodachrome that came back from the lab without images, only fields of light), concern the materiality of celluloid film and processes involved in its exposure, resulting in works that slowly evolve an awareness of the uses and unintended consequences of light in the filmmaking process.|$|R

5000|$|Two {{perforation}} pitches {{are available}} for 16 mm film. One specification, known as [...] "long pitch", has a spacing of 0.3000 inch (7.620 mm) and is used primarily for print and reversal film stocks.

50|$|In the {{traditional}} photochemical post-production workflow, release prints are usually copies, made using a high-speed continuous <b>contact</b> <b>printer,</b> of an internegative (sometimes {{referred to as}} a 'dupe negative'), which in turn is a copy of an interpositive (these were sometimes referred to as 'lavender prints' in the past), which in turn is a copy, optically printed to incorporate special effects, fades, etc., from the cut camera negative.

5000|$|A [...] heliographic copier or [...] heliographic {{duplicator}} is {{an apparatus}} {{used in the}} world of reprography for making contact prints on paper from original drawings made with that purpose on tracing paper, parchment paper or any other transparent or translucent material using different procedures.

In this study, we describe surface modifications to passivate cell microarrays, aiming to adapt the platform {{to the study of}} stem cell behavior over long-term culture periods. Functionalization of glass slides with (3 -glycidyloxypropyl) trimethoxysilane enabled covalent anchoring of extracellular matrix proteins on microscale spots printed by a robotic <b>contact</b> <b>printer.</b> Subsequently, the surface was passivated by bovine serum albumin (BSA) or poly(ethylene glycol) bisamine (A-PEG) with molecular weights of 3000, 6000, and 10 [*] 000 Da. Cloud-point conditions for A-PEG grafting were attained that were compatible with protein deposition. Passivation strategies were assessed by culturing mesenchymal stem cells on the microarray platform. While both BSA and A-PEG passivation initially blocked cell adhesion between the printed spots, only A-PEG grafting was able to maintain cell pattern integrity over the entire culture period of 3 weeks. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{micro contact}} printing, a polymer stamp with sub micron {{features}} is use to pattern a substrate. Micro contact printing has many applications including micro machined circuits and miniaturized biological test kits. Success in printing {{has been achieved}} in limited batch processing of plate to plate printing. The physics and chemistry of stamp contact and ink transfer has been studied. To make micro contact printing economically viable developments {{have been made to}} advance a roll to roll configuration. Roll to roll processing offers the potential of high volume low cost micro manufacturing similar to the high volume achieved by roll to roll processing for traditional lithography. Roll to roll micro contact printers have been built at the lab scale. The process has been demonstrate to have the potential for rapid high volume production. The current limitation is in the quality of the print. Features on the stamp are printed with defects such as breaks or undesired patterning. The source of failure lies with the contact of the stamp; the stamp either breaking contact or collapsing to allow areas outside of the features to make contact. A barrier to better understanding and controlling contact during the printing process has been a lack of in-process measurement.

40|$|Porous polymethacrylates have {{numerous}} important {{applications in}} different research and industrial fields. These materials {{have been used}} as stationary phases for separation and catalysis, as substrates for thin layer chromatography, as materials for solid-phase extraction or filtration, or for making valves in microfluidic devices. The main advantage of porous polymethacrylates is that their physical and chemical properties, such as porosity, pore and polymer globule size, stiffness, hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity, as well as surface functional groups can be conveniently controlled by adjusting the composition of the polymerization mixtures. Porous polymethacrylate can be also functionalized using available surface modification strategies. This unique ability to control properties of porous polymethacrylates makes them suitable for the design and synthesis of novel functional materials. Surprisingly, most of the applications of porous polymethacrylates have been limited to their use inside columns, capillaries or microfluidic channels and their applications as open surfaces remained to a great extent unexplored. The goals of my PhD thesis were to: (1) develop methods for the preparation of (bio) functional porous polymethacrylate surfaces with well-defined surface properties; (2) characterize produced surfaces; (3) explore their unique properties in different biological applications. Surfaces with gradient properties have been widely used in many cell-surface interaction studies because these gradient surfaces offer the possibility to avoid the difficulties associated with the one-sample-for-one-measurement approach as well as the problems with sample variations. However, up to now, {{there are only a few}} methods for the preparation of surfaces with gradient properties. Taking advantage of the tunable porous properties of polymethacrylates, porous poly(butyl methacrylate-co-ethylene dimethacrylate) (BMA-EDMA) surfaces with gradient surface morphologies were prepared using a PDMS microfluidic chip designed and produced for this study. The produced BMA-EDMA surface possessed a gradient polymer globule size ranging from 0. 1 µm to 0. 5 µm. The surface with the globule size gradient in this range is useful for cell studies such as investigation of the effect of surface morphology on cell behavior. Porous polymethacrylate surfaces with a gradient in density of functional groups were also prepared via photografting by gradually varying the UV dosage along one direction on the surface during surface modification. The formation of the gradient was confirmed with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and water contact angle measurements. To show the potential of using the surface with a gradient density of functional groups, the behavior of human fibrosarcoma HT- 1080 cells was studied on the surface. Recently, bio-inspired slippery liquid infused porous surfaces have attracted much attention due to their unique liquid repellent and self-cleaning properties. In this thesis, stable slippery surfaces were prepared by infusing the porous BMA-EDMA surface with water immiscible hydrophobic poly(hexafluoropropylene oxide) or perfluorotripentylamine. The antibacterial and anti-marine fouling properties of the slippery BMA-EDMA surfaces were carefully investigated. Our results demonstrated that the slippery BMA-EDMA surfaces had good antibacterial and anti-marine fouling properties. However, the results also revealed that the antibacterial property of the slippery BMA-EDMA surface was bacterial strain dependent. In addition, Ulva sporelings (young plants) were able to firmly attach to the slippery surface although the surface is able to resist Ulva spore adhesion. The ability to transform a superhydrophobic surface to a superhydrophilic one is essential for many applications such as creating superhydrophobic-superhydrophilic micropatterns or microarrays. Most of the existing methods for this transformation are time consuming or require harsh conditions. In this thesis, a new facile method to transform the superhydrophobic BMA-EDMA surface to a superhydrophilic one was developed. This method is based on the physisorption of an amphiphilic phospholipid on the hydrophobic surface of porous BMA-EDMA through hydrophobic-hydrophobic interactions. Using this method, superhydrophobic-superhydrophilic micropatterns could be fabricated simply by printing the phospholipid “ink” on the superhydrophobic BMA-EDMA surface with a <b>contact</b> <b>printer.</b> ...|$|E
