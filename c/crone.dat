5|$|In Islam: The Untold Story, Holland {{deals with}} {{the origins of the}} {{religion}} Islam. Travelling to Saudi Arabia, he visits Arabian Bedouins to hear their orthodox Islamic accounts of the religion's origins. Holland then talks to Seyyed Hossein Nasr, a practising Muslim who teaches Islamic studies at the George Washington University, Washington D.C., and Patricia <b>Crone,</b> a non-Muslim historian of Islamic history at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton. The former defends the orthodox Islamic account of the faith's history, citing its development within oral history, but <b>Crone</b> challenges the reliability of oral history, and therefore the traditional account.|$|E
5|$|In November 2006 Jim <b>Crone</b> and Sergeant Major Pete Jackson, senior tunnel guide {{with the}} Royal Gibraltar Regiment, met {{possibly}} {{the only member}} of Operation Tracer still alive when they travelled to meet Dr. W. A. Bruce Cooper at his home in England. Cooper, 92 at the time, provided an opportunity to shed light on the operation with his direct involvement in the mission as a Surgeon-Lieutenant in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve (RNVR). He recalled stories about his colleagues, his training, and his feelings about the task.|$|E
2500|$|The {{major theme}} of <b>Crone's</b> {{scholarly}} {{life was the}} fundamental questioning of the historicity of Islamic sources about the beginnings of Islam. <b>Crone's</b> two most known works concentrate on this topic: Hagarism and Meccan Trade. Three decades after Hagarism, Fred Donner called Patricia <b>Crone's</b> work a [...] "milestone" [...] {{in the field of}} Orientalist study of Islam.|$|R

5|$|Adopting the {{theories}} of academic historian Patricia <b>Crone</b> as a basis, Holland asserted {{that there was little}} hard evidence for the origins of Islam and asked why it took several decades after the death of Muhammad for his name to appear on surviving documents or artifacts. Arguing that there was little evidence for how the faith was born, he suggested that the city of Mecca {{may not have been the}} real birthplace of Muhammad and Islam, and– while not clearly disputing Muhammad's existence as a real historical figure– claimed that much of the Islamic origin story was later developed in the early years of the Arab Empire.|$|E
25|$|Savage {{has also}} opposed state {{legislation}} proscribing {{the sale of}} sex toys. After an exposé by Kandiss <b>Crone</b> from WLBT (Jackson, Mississippi) precipitated the arrest and fining of an adult video store owner, Savage suggested that readers send any sex toys {{that they needed to}} dispose of to <b>Crone.</b>|$|E

50|$|While Tal and Crow {{climb the}} tower, Milla returns to Odris by the {{labyrinth}} of underground tunnels below the Castle. On her way, she discovers the skeleton where her Primary Sunstone partially originated. Scrutinizing it closer, she notices a long Violet fingernail, which she puts on. Knowing that she will give herself to the Ice, she breathes the Tenth Pattern to assure the completion of her task of getting a Primary Sunstone. On her way, she is attacked by Arla and a band of Shield Maidens for bringing Odris. Milla accidentally kills Arla with her talon. She is then judged by the <b>Crones,</b> who will decide her fate. After reviewing Milla's thoughts and dreams, the <b>Crones</b> debate and decide to attack the Castle to stop the Spiritshadow trade and save the Veil. The <b>Crones</b> choose Milla to lead the attack.|$|R

25|$|After the flood, Namu Doryeong met a <b>crone</b> and her {{two daughters}} on Mt. Baekdu. The crone's family did not die because Mt. Baekdu was the highest {{mountain}} in Korea. The <b>crone</b> gave Namu Doryong a contest, and if Namu Doryeong won, he could have her daughter's hand in marriage. Namu Doryeong won the contest because of {{the aid of a}} swarm of ants. The ants were the very ants that Namu Doryeong had saved.|$|E

Keira directs Geralt to the <b>Crones</b> of Crookback Bog, malicious, ancient spirits {{residing}} near Velen. The <b>Crones</b> reveal that they had captured Ciri for the Wild Hunt before she escaped, {{and that they have}} enslaved the Baron's missing wife, Anna. After determining Anna's fate, Geralt returns to the Baron who tells him that Ciri went to Novigrad.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a triumph}} for Margaret Henan. This paragon was hers, and it bore the {{cherished}} name. With {{the one exception}} of her mother, friends and relatives drifted back and acknowledged {{that they had been}} mistaken; though there were old <b>crones</b> who still abided by their opinion and who shook their heads ominously over their cups of tea. The boy was too wonderful to last. There was no escaping the curse of the name his mother had wickedly laid upon him. The young generation joined Margaret Henan in laughing at them, but the old <b>crones</b> continued to shake their heads.|$|R
