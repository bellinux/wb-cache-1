40|$|Resorbable {{phosphate}} glass fibre (PGF) reinforced polymer composites {{have been investigated}} for use as fracture fixation plates. While demonstrating impressive initial properties, these composites have shown poor retention of mechanical properties after immersion in a hydrolytic environment. Existing commercially available coupling agents for conventional glass composites have been of limited value and so novel coupling agents have been created specifically for PGF/ Poly (lactide) composites. Previous work on sorbitol-initiated poly (lactide) (S-PLA) oligomers has shown potential both in single fibre and full body composites. This thesis investigates chain length and concentration optimisation of S-PLA based coupling agents on the interfacial properties of PGF reinforced composites, both as manufactured and throughout degradation. S-PLA was synthesised to three different chain lengths: S-PLA_s, S-PLA_m and S-PLA_l where s is short, m – medium and l – long. The oligomers were characterised via NMR, GPC, DSC and FTIR. 40 P 2 O 5 - 24 MgO- 16 CaO- 16 Na 2 O- 4 Fe 2 O 3 (P 40) PGF fibres were produced and coated with S-PLA_s, S-PLA_m and S-PLA_l oligomers. It {{was found that the}} optimum coating concentration depended on the chain length of the oligomer. Initial tensile strength of the <b>coated</b> <b>fibres</b> increased compared to control though the increase was only significant for S-PLA_s <b>coated</b> <b>fibres.</b> A subsequent degradation study of the fibres in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 37 °C for 7 days showed that the tensile strength of the <b>coated</b> <b>fibres</b> decreased significantly compared to that of the control uncoated fibres. S-PLA_l <b>coated</b> <b>fibres</b> had better retention of the tensile strength than the medium and short chain <b>coated</b> <b>fibres.</b> Initial IFSS of embedded S-PLA <b>coated</b> <b>fibres</b> increased significantly compared to that of control but did not differ significantly from each other. A degradation study was conducted for single fibre composites with embedded control and <b>coated</b> <b>fibres</b> immersed in PBS at 37 °C for 7 days. Uncertainty in the true fibre strength during degradation made the IFSS of degraded single fibre composites inconclusive. Full-body composite studies were undertaken to investigate further. Two different methods of application of S-PLA_s on to UD fibre mats were considered: dip coating and spray coating. Composite longitudinal and transverse flexural properties were assessed prior to and after degradation in PBS at 37 °C. The coupling agent improved initial flexural properties and was effective in retaining composite properties for up to 14 days. S-PLA spray coated UD composite samples was more effective in retaining interfacial properties. Water uptake and wet mass change in longitudinal and transverse samples were stable up to 14 days after an initial increase seen at day 1. After day 14 a significant increase in water uptake and wet mass was observed for control composite samples compared to S-PLA coated samples. SEM micrographs and an increase in acidity observed at these time points show advanced fibre dissolution. XRD analysis for composite samples showed a crystallization peak at 16. 5 ° that did not increase in intensity throughout the degradation period indicating that the crystalline phase did not change during the study. The chain length of S-PLA did not appear to affect the IFSS if the appropriate coating concentration was selected. S-PLA_s was selected due to ease of manufacture however the effect of the other chain lengths on macroscopic composite properties needs to be investigated. The method of coupling agent application onto fibre mats did not appear {{to make a difference in}} initial mechanical properties; however the spray coating method shows potential in retarding degradation. This requires further investigation...|$|E

40|$|The {{alveolar}} {{content of}} fibres and asbestos bodies {{was assessed by}} bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in 21 asbestos sprayers. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy (TEM and SEM) and two light microscopical (LM) methods, cytocentrifugation, and Millipore filtration were used. The subjects had been exposed mainly to crocidolite asbestos {{for an average of}} 2. 8 (range 0. 2 - 13) years in 1950 - 75. The mean (median) total fibre count (of asbestos bodies and uncoated fibres) per ml of BAL fluid was 5500 (2800) by TEM and 2900 (1000) by SEM. The mean (median) count of asbestos bodies per ml with LM was 810 (500) with cytocentrifugation and 750 (480) with Millipore filtration, 840 (320) by TEM, and 1750 (420) by SEM. The mean proportion of <b>coated</b> <b>fibres</b> was 35 % by TEM and 45 % by SEM. The mean length of the <b>coated</b> <b>fibres</b> was 22 (range 4 - 65) microns by TEM and 34 (range 4. 5 - 170) microns by SEM.

40|$|International audienceReliability of {{standard}} single mode silica optical <b>fibre</b> and hermetic <b>coated</b> <b>fibre</b> {{has been investigated}} through chemical exposure to hydrofluoric acid (HF) vapours into a hermetic closed disposal for different durations. Dynamic fatigue tests were implemented using a two-point bending testing device. Three series of samples subject to HF attack for variable times were compared. Standard fibres tested immediately after exposure show a broader distribution of fibre strength accompanied by the drastic decrease of the failure stress. Drying treated standard fibres prior to testing has also led to a broader distribution and a slight decrease of failure stress by comparison to as-received fibres. Drying in oven prior to mechanical measurement makes handling difficult and results in brittle fibres that exhibit much lower strength and broader distribution of failure stress. Polymer reacts with hydrogen fluoride, which induces viscosity changes, but it returns to solid state after thermal treatment. This is consistent with SEM observations. Same experiments have been implemented on the hermetic <b>coated</b> <b>fibre.</b> No {{significant change in the}} Weibull distribution and the mean fibre strength was observed after 6 days of chemical exposure to HF vapours.

40|$|Uncoated SiC fibres in SiC/SiC {{composites}} {{manufactured by}} the liquid-silicon infiltration (LSI) process show a strong degradation {{as a result}} of silicon attack. The goal of this research is the development of a SiNx-based fibre coating, which acts as a barrier against the liquid silicon. The coating is applied by means of low-pressure chemical vapour deposition (LPCVD) utilising the gaseous precursors silane (SiH 4) and ammonia (NH 3) on a commercial SiC multifilament yarn. The result is an amorphous fibre coating with an increasing coating thickness and a variable chemical composition {{from the middle of the}} yarn to the edges.

40|$|High-resolution X-ray {{photoelectron}} spectroscopy (XPS) {{has been}} used to analyse the fibre surface and composite interfaces with and without polyvinyl alcohol (PVAL) <b>coating</b> (both <b>fibres</b> being commercially surface-treated and sized). Major functional groups on the fibre surface are also identified by Gaussian curve-fitting of carbon peaks to study the correlations of surface chemistry with the observed failure mechanisms of the uncoated and <b>coated</b> <b>fibre</b> composites. The main difference in the fracture surface of the fibre composites with and without the coating is that the latter has a significant amount of silicon (about 6 at% concentration) associated with the epoxy matrix, but silicon is almost absent in the PVAL-coated fibre composites. This suggests that the debonding mechanism in the uncoated fibre composite, which has a strong interfacial bonding, is controlled by the combination of cohesive failure of the matrix material and adhesive failure at the interface. In contrast, the PVAL coating promotes adhesive failure due to the weak bonding at the fibre-matrix interface. This observation is consistent with SEM observations in that the uncoated fibre composite consists of significant deformation of matrix material which covers the majority of the fracture surface and tiny epoxy resin particles adhering to the debonded fibre surface, whereas the <b>coated</b> <b>fibre</b> composite shows a lesser amount of matrix deformation with relatively clean fibre surface...|$|R
