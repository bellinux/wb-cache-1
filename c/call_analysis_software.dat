50|$|Telephone call data, such as {{originating}} station, destination, {{start and}} ending times, and transmission characteristics, is collected from a telecommunications system or {{private branch exchange}} (PBX) in form of call detail records (CDRs). The equipment typically presents this data on older PBXs via a serial communications port, or more recently via a computer network over an Ethernet connection. From the interface, CDRs are collected on computer systems running <b>call</b> logging and <b>analysis</b> <b>software.</b> Some PBX manufacturers provide their own basic call logging software but many other third-party software packages are available.|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The unified {{power flow}} {{controller}} (UPFC) {{is the most}} versatile and advanced member of flexible ac transmission systems (FACTS) devices capable of controlling active-reactive power flows, {{as well as providing}} voltage magnitude control in power networks. This paper presents a study on investigating steady-state analysis of UPFC and its performance on power systems. Firstly, a mathematical model of UPFC suitable for power flow studies are derived in the form of injected powers called “modified power injection model”, the model is then adopted into a power flow <b>software</b> <b>called</b> power system <b>analysis</b> <b>software</b> package (PSASP) ”. Computer simulations based on the IEEE 30 -bus test system are proposed and results show that a UPFC embedded into a power system can handle control of the power flow problem efficiently. Finally the effects of the UPFC location on power system operations are investigated. Relevant results are presented and discussed in full...|$|R
40|$|Enterprise level {{software}} is implemented using multi-layer architecture. These layers are often implemented using de-coupled solutions {{with millions of}} lines of code. Programmers often have to track and debug a function call from user interface layer to the data access layer while troubleshooting an issue. They have to inspect the code based on search results or use design documents to construct the call graph. This process is time consuming and laborious. The development environment tools are insufficient or confined to analyzing only the code in the loaded solution. This paper proposes a method to construct a call graph of the call across several layers of the code residing in different code bases to help programmers better understand the design and architecture of the software. The signatures of class, methods, and properties were evaluated and then matched against the code files. A graph of matching functions was created. The recursive search stopped {{when there were no}} matches or the data layer code was detected. The method resulted in 78. 26 % accuracy when compared with manual search.

40|$|Affymetrix’s SNP (single {{nucleotide}} polymorphism) genotyping chips {{have increased}} the scope and decreased the cost of gene mapping studies. Because each SNP is queried by mul- tiple DNA probes, the chips present interesting challenges in genotype calling. Traditional clustering methods distinguish the three genotypes of a SNP fairly well given a large enough sample of unrelated individuals or a training sample of known genotypes. The present pa- per describes our attempt to improve genotype calling by constructing Gaussian penetrance models with empirically derived priors. The priors stabilize parameter estimation and borrow information collectively gathered on {{tens of thousands of}} SNPs. When data from related family members are available, Gaussian penetrance models capture the correlations in signals between relatives. With these advantages in mind, we apply the models to Affymetrix probe intensity data on 10, 000 SNPs gathered on 63 genotyped individuals spread over eight pedigrees. We integrate the genotype calling model with pedigree analysis and examine a sequence of sym- metry hypotheses involving the correlated probe signals. The symmetry hypotheses raise novel mathematical issues of parameterization. Using the BIC criterion, we select the best combi- nation of symmetry assumptions. Compared to the genotype calling results obtained from Affymetrix’s software, we are able {{to reduce the number of}} no-calls substantially and quan- tify the level of confidence in all <b>calls.</b> Once pedigree <b>analysis</b> <b>software</b> can accommodate soft penetrances, we can expect to see more reliable association and linkage studies with less wasted genotyping data...|$|R
40|$|Background Targeted Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) {{offers a}} way to {{implement}} testing of multiple genetic aberrations in diagnostic pathology practice, which is necessary for personalized cancer treatment. However, no standards regarding input material have been defined. This study therefore aimed {{to determine the effect}} of the type of input material (e. g. formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) versus fresh frozen (FF) tissue) on NGS derived results. Moreover, this study aimed to explore a standardized analysis pipeline to support consistent clinical decision-making. Method We used the Ion Torrent PGM sequencing platform in combination with the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v 2 to sequence frequently mutated regions in 50 cancer related genes, and validated the NGS detected variants in 250 FFPE samples using standard diagnostic assays. Next, 386 tumour samples were sequenced to explore the effect of input material on variant detection variables. For variant <b>calling,</b> Ion Torrent <b>analysis</b> <b>software</b> was supplemented with additional variant annotation and filtering. Results Both FFPE and FF tissue could be sequenced reliably with a sensitivity of 99. 1 %. Validation showed a 98. 5 %concordance between NGS and conventional sequencing techniques, where NGS provided both the advantage of low input DNA concentration and the detection of low-frequency variants. The reliability of mutation analysis could be further improved with manual inspection of sequence data. Conclusion Targeted NGS can be reliably implemented in cancer diagnostics using both FFPE and FF tissue when using appropriate analysis settings, even with low input DNA...|$|R
