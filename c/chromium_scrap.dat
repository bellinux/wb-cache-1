40|$|Chromium is an {{important}} industrial metal used in various products and processes. Hexavalent chromium is relative mobile in the environment and is acutely toxic, mutagenic, teratogenic and carcinogenic. The impacts of chromium on {{human health and the}} environment is of wide concern. Therefore, it is imperative that hexavalent chromium be removed from wastewater. A removal of hexavalent <b>chromium</b> using <b>scrap</b> iron filings was studied in both synthetic wastewater, containing 30 mg l- 1 of hexavalent chromium, and chromium plating wastewater. All experiments were evaluated in batch experiments. Effective conditions for removal of hexavalent chromium were found to be pH of 3, iron particle sizes of 35 -> 200 mesh, agitating rate at 250 rpm, contact time at 180 mins., iron dosage of 1 g. According to the experiment results, almost all of hexavalent chromium was transformed to trivalent chromium. Trivalent chromium and total iron in the aqueous solution were then removed by precipitation with alkaline solutions. In this work, sodium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide were used. It was found that the use of sodium hydroxide was more effective than that of calcium hydroxide. The reaction rate constants from the results following first order reaction were calculated. In addition, it was found that nickel and copper in the aqueous solution did not affect on the reduction of hexavalent chromium...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Hexavalent {{chromium}} {{is highly}} toxic to most living organisms and a known human carcinogen by the inhalation route of exposure. Therefore, treatment of Cr(VI) contaminated wastewater is essential before their discharge {{to the natural}} water bodies. Cr(VI) reduction to Cr(III) can be beneficial because a more mobile and more toxic chromium species is converted to a less mobile and less toxic form. Zero-valence-state metals, such as scrap iron, can serve as electron donors for reducing Cr(VI) to Cr(III). The influence of pH on scrap iron capacity to reduce Cr(VI) was investigated in this study. Maximum reduction capacity of scrap iron was observed {{at the beginning of}} the column experiments; the lower the pH, the greater the experiment duration with maximum scrap iron reduction capacity. The experimental results showed that highest maximum reduction capacity of scrap iron was 12. 5 mg Cr(VI) /g scrap iron, at pH 2. 0, and decreased with increasing pH up to 1. 9 mg Cr(VI) /g scrap iron at pH = 7. 3.

40|$|This study {{intends to}} better control the final {{composition}} of steel {{by trying to}} have a better knowledge of elements including copper, nickel, molybdenum, manganese, tin and <b>chromium</b> in the <b>scrap.</b> This objective was approached by applying probability and statistical concepts such as normal distribution, multiple linear regression and least square and non-negative least square concepts. The study was performed on the raw materials’ information of Ovako Smedjebacken and Ovako Hofors, two steel production plants in Sweden. The information included but were not limited to the amount of the different scrap types used in the charge, total weight of the charge and the final composition of the produced steel.   First, the concept of normal distribution was used as to consider the variations of the alloying elements between the estimated and measured alloy contents. The data were then used to consider a model for distribution factor of the studied elements. Also, an estimation of the alloy contents in the scrap type given the final steel composition was carried out using the concept of probability and statistics. At the end, a comparison of the results from the different concepts was done...|$|R
40|$|Chromium is an {{important}} alloying element for stainless steels and other Cr-bearing steels. During the steelmaking process chromium {{is added to the}} steels mainly in the form of ferrochrome, which is largely produced by the energy-intensive smelting reduction process of chromite ore in the submerged arc furnace. To reduce the overall energy consumption during the ferrochrome production process and the chromium alloying process, direct chromiumalloying by chromite ore has been proposed. The application of this process will integrate the processes for ferrochrome production and chromium alloying, and thus has the potential to cut the production costs of the Cr-bearing steels by avoiding, or at least partially avoiding, the usage of ferrochrome. Further, this new alloying process has the capacity to improve therecovery of chromium from chromite ore. This thesis presents fundamental studies on the carbothermic reduction of synthetic iron chromite (FeCr 2 O 4) and chromite ore, which aim at designing a direct alloying precursor to be applied in the industrial process. Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) experiments have been carried out to investigate the carbothermic reduction processes of FeCr 2 O 4 in the absence/presence of metallic iron, and of chromite ore in the absence/presence of mill scale. In the case of using the mixture ‘FeCr 2 O 4 +iron powder + graphite’, it is found that the presence of metallic iron enhances the reduction of FeCr 2 O 4, and this enhancing effect increases with increasing iron addition. The enhancing effect of iron addition on the reduction of FeCr 2 O 4 {{is due to the fact}} that the reduction of component Cr 2 O 3 in FeCr 2 O 4 is enhanced, and this effect is attributed to the presence of solidiron which can decrease the activity of chromium by having chromium in situ dissolved in the iron. In the case of using the mixture ‘chromite ore + petcoke’, it is found that the reduction of iron ions in the chromite ore starts before that of chromium ions in the ore and the reduction of iron ions and chromium ions in the ore overlaps to some degree. (Cr,Fe) 7 C 3 is found to bethe intermediate phase during the reduction and a chromium gradient is found in the spinel phase of the fractional reduced sample at 1673 K. A four-stage reduction process is proposed: one stage involving the reduction of iron ions in the chromite ore and three stages involving the reduction of chromium ions in the ore. The activity aspects of component FeCr 2 O 4 and component MgCr 2 O 4 in the chromite ore have been considered. The difficulty in the reductionof the chromite ore is attributed to the fact that, as the reduction proceeds, the activity of component MgCr 2 O 4 in the fractional reduced ore will decrease to a very low level, which makes the further reduction very difficult. In the case of using the mixture ‘chromite ore + mill scale + petcoke’, it is found that mill scale is reduced to iron before 1573 K. The asreduced iron is disseminated around chromite ore particles and, at the same time, some carbonis dissolved in the iron via diffusion. Reduction of chromite ore is enhanced with the addition of mill scale at temperatures higher than 1623 K, and the enhancing effect increases with increasing mill scale addition. The enhancing effect, in this case, is attributed to the presence of molten Fe-Cr-C phase in the vicinity of chromite ore, which can decrease the activity of chromium by having chromium in situ dissolved into the melt. Induction furnace experiments have been carried out to investigate the effectiveness of some different alloying mixtures. The experimental results have confirmed the necessity ofadjusting the composition of the slag to ensure high chromium yield in the final product and the experimental results show that, by using iron <b>scrap,</b> <b>chromium</b> yield can reach 90 %. The present findings have led to the proposal of using ‘chromite ore + mill scale + petcoke’ as alloying precursor for direct chromium alloying. The effectiveness of this alloying precursor needs to be further explored by induction furnace experiments, followed by full scale Electric Arc Furnace experiments.
