2500|$|The Glock 17 is a 9 mm short recoil–operated, locked-breech {{semi-automatic}} pistol {{that uses}} a modified Browning cam-lock system adapted from the Hi-Power pistol. The firearm's locking mechanism uses a linkless, vertically tilting barrel with a rectangular breech that locks into the ejection port cut-out in the slide. During the recoil stroke, the barrel moves rearward initially locked together with the slide about [...] until the bullet leaves the barrel and chamber pressure drops to a safe level. A ramped lug extension {{at the base of}} the barrel then interacts with a tapered locking block integrated into the frame, forcing the barrel down and unlocking it from the slide. This <b>camming</b> <b>action</b> terminates the barrel's movement while the slide continues back under recoil, extracting and ejecting the spent cartridge casing. The slide's uninterrupted rearward movement and counter-recoil cycle are characteristic of the Browning system.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{many other}} {{military}} rifles of the day, the Lee was not {{fitted with a}} turning bolt. [...] Though frequently described as a straight-pull action, the M1895 Lee actually uses a <b>camming</b> <b>action</b> in which a steel wedge or locking block beneath the bolt is forced into a recessed area in the receiver. [...] Pulling the operating handle back causes the bolt to rock back and upwards, freeing a locking stud on the receiver and unlocking the bolt. [...] The firing pin cocked on final closing where the resistance would be overcome by the forward inertia of closing the action. [...] Once the rather odd [...] "up and back" [...] bolt movement was mastered, {{and as long as}} the action was clean and well-lubricated, it worked fairly well, though the slightly inclined opening stroke proved awkward for some men when the rifle was operated from the shoulder. [...] Despite this, the Navy's Chief of Ordnance noted with approval that the Lee rifle could be fired [...] "with great rapidity", achieving a rate of fire considerably faster than most existing turn-bolt rifles of the day.|$|E

2500|$|Bottleneck rifle {{cartridges}} {{are particularly}} prone to encounter incipient head separations {{if they are}} full-length re-sized and re-trimmed to their maximum permitted case lengths each time they are reloaded. [...] In some such cartridges, such as the [...]303 British when used in Enfield rifles, as few as 1 or 2 re-loadings can be the limit, before {{the head of the}} cartridge will physically separate from the body of the cartridge when fired. [...] The solution to this problem, of avoiding overstretching of the brass case, and thereby avoiding the excessive thinning of the wall thickness of the brass case due to case stretching, is to use what is called a [...] "head space gauge". [...] Contrary to its name, it does not actually measure a rifle's headspace. [...] Rather, it measures the distance from the head of the cartridge {{to the middle of the}} shoulder of the bottleneck cartridge case. [...] For semi-automatic and automatic rifles, customary practice is to move the midpoint of this shoulder back by no more than 0.005 inches, for reliable operation, when resizing the case. [...] For bolt-action rifles, with their additional <b>camming</b> <b>action,</b> customary practice is to move this shoulder back by only 0.001 to 0.002 inches when resizing the case. [...] In contrast to full-length resizing of bottleneck rifle cartridges, which can rapidly thin out the wall thickness of bottleneck rifle cartridges due to case stretching that occurs each time when fired, partial length re-sizing of the bottleneck case that pushes shoulders back only a few thousandths of an inch will often permit a case to be safely reloaded 5 times or more, even up to 10 times, or more for very light loads.|$|E
2500|$|With bottlenecked {{cartridge}} cases, {{choosing the}} right sizing die can also be important. Full length sizing of cartridges is often thought to greatly shorten case life by work hardening {{the full length of}} the case, which can cause the case neck to split, although some studies show that the number of reloads possible with a case is essentially the same for either full length sizing as for neck sizing only if the issue is one of neck hardening. If the reloaded cartridges are going {{to be used in the}} same firearm in which they were previously fired, though, and if that firearm has a bolt action or other action with a strong <b>camming</b> <b>action</b> on closing, then full length resizing may not be needed. A collet neck sizing die can be used to size just the case neck enough to hold the bullet, and leave the rest of the case unsized. The resulting cartridge will chamber into the specific rifle that previously fired it, though the fit might be tight and require more force to chamber than a full length resized case. The use of a neck-sizing die in conjunction with moderate pressure loads may extend the life of the case significantly by minimizing the amount of case that is work hardened or stretched. This is especially true for reloads intended for military rifles with intentionally large chambers such as the Lee–Enfield in [...]303 British. [...] The use of partial length or neck sizing for cartridges used in such large chambers permits effectively switching the headspacing from relying on the rim of a rimmed cartridge to the shoulder of the bottle neck transition instead, increasing the number of times a rimmed military cartridge can be reloaded from once to perhaps 5 or more times, all while avoiding dangerous incipient head separations. [...] One final form of limiting case wear is, unfortunately, limited strictly to benchrest shooters with custom-cut chambers. The chamber of these rifles is cut so that there is just enough room, typically just a few thousandths of an inch, in the neck area. [...] The result of using this type of chamber is that fired rounds don't require any resizing whatsoever once the case is fired. [...] The brass will 'spring back' a bit after firing, and will properly hold a new bullet without further manipulation. Some refer to this as a 'fitted' neck, however it is a function of both the carefully cut precision neck and the case adjusted to fit with very little clearance.|$|E

5000|$|The {{device is}} {{inserted}} into a crack so that {{pulling on the}} tape makes the piece cam outward against {{the sides of the}} crack, gripping the rock tighter. <b>Camming</b> <b>action</b> is achieved by the position of the pointed fulcrum or pivot of the cam relative to the attachment of the tape.

50|$|Hexes may {{be placed}} either as passive or active protection. When placed passively they work like chock stones in flared cracks, like other {{climbing}} nuts, just larger {{and with a}} different shape.

They are often preferred by alpine mountaineers over spring-loaded camming devices because of their lack of moving parts and overall lower weight for the same size crack.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the slide}} of the pistol enters battery, the striker engages the sear. At this point, the sear is held {{back in a}} {{partially}} cocked condition. When the trigger of the M&P is pulled, the trigger bar first engages the firing pin safety plunger, lifting it upward, and releasing firing pin safety. At the rearward extreme of the trigger bar's travel, it engages the sear. The sear is rotated downward by the trigger bar, fully cocking, then releasing the striker. The striker makes contact with the primer of the chambered round, which in turn ignites the gunpowder and propels the bullet forward. According to renowned M&P gunsmith Dan Burwell, the angle on the rear face of the sear creates a <b>camming</b> <b>action</b> against the striker. This <b>camming</b> <b>action</b> moves the striker to the rear very slightly during the trigger pull, thus finishing the [...] "cocking". This system {{is similar to the}} partially tensioned striker found in the Glock series of pistols. When the pistol cycles for the next shot, the striker will be automatically pre-set in a 98% cocked position. Because the striker is only 98% cocked prior to the trigger being pulled, Smith & Wesson classifies the M&P's action as [...] "striker fired (double action only)".|$|E

Though, in a fall with a reverse threaded GriGri, bending the rope sharply under the GriGri provides more than enough friction to hold a falling climber as long as the belayer locks off the rope as they would with a tube style (passive) device.|$|E
50|$|The Model 52 was a non-rotating, rear-locked bolt-action design. The Model D-derived {{receiver}} was cylindrical, {{bored and}} machined from a forged billet, and of substantial thickness. The bolt's dual locking lugs {{were part of}} the rotating bolt-handle collar, which provided a <b>camming</b> <b>action</b> to seal the breech on closing and extract the spent case on opening. The bolt itself was undercut for the forward third of its length and rode on polished flats; a projecting lug at the front edge caught the top cartridge in the magazine. The bolt face was rebated so as to surround the case rim, and was chamfered to fit the recessed receiver ring. Dual-opposed sprung claw extractors were inlet into the sides of the bolt, providing controlled cartridge feed. A fixed blade-type ejector was located {{at the rear of the}} loading platform.|$|E

50|$|A camstrap is a {{piece of}} webbing with a buckle that is used to secure a {{cylinder}} or scuba tank to a buoyancy compensator or backplate.

Cam straps are also typically used in whitewater rafting to tie rowing frames to the rafts. However, the cam buckle used in rafting cam straps is very different from one used in diving. The rafting cam strap has a self-locking cam lever that cannot be accidentally released. A thumb released cam locks the webbing in place and its locking action even allows tightening one handed.|$|R

50|$|In the Mauser-style turn-bolt action, {{the bolt}} handle must be rotated counter-{{clockwise}}, drawn rearward, pushed forward, and finally rotated clockwise back into lock. In a straight-pull action, the bolt lever can be cycled without rotating it, hence producing a reduced {{range of motion}} by the shooter from four movements to two, {{with the goal of}} increasing the rifle's rate of fire. The Ross and Schmidt-Rubin rifles load via stripper clips, albeit of an unusual paperboard and steel design in the Schmidt-Rubin rifle, while the Mannlicher uses en-bloc clips. The Schmidt-Rubin series, which culminated in the K31, are also known for being among the most accurate military rifles ever made. Yet another variant of the straight-pull bolt action, of which the M1895 Lee Navy is an example, is a <b>camming</b> <b>action</b> in which pulling the bolt handle causes the bolt to rock, freeing a stud from the receiver and unlocking the bolt.|$|E
5000|$|The Pattern 1914 Enfield had a large, strong bolt action, and {{the bolt}} travel is long, {{as it was}} {{designed}} for the dimensionally large and powerful [...]276 Enfield cartridge. The bolt action had a Model 98 Mauser type claw extractor and two forward lugs; {{there was also a}} rear safety lug formed by the base of the bolt handle sitting in a recess in the receiver. Much faster and smoother to operate than a Model 98 Mauser, the bolt was well-supported throughout its travel and the <b>camming</b> <b>action</b> on opening and closing the bolt facilitated ease and speed of operation. The unusual 'dog-leg' shaped bolt handle is low profile and places the bolt knob just rearwards of the trigger close to the firer's hand, again facilitating rapid cycling and fire. Like the Lee-Enfield, the safety falls under the firer's thumb and can be operated silently.|$|E
50|$|The Browning Hi-Power BDA is a {{semi-automatic}} short recoil operated locked breech firearm. It has a vertically tilting delayed <b>camming</b> <b>action.</b> This {{locking mechanism}} was {{borrowed from the}} Browning Hi-Power. The handgun features a double-action trigger which cocks and then releases the hammer. The recoil of the slide recocks the hammer, and all consecutive shots are fired from the single-action mode. A disconnector ensures the pistol fires in semi-automatic mode only. The spring-loaded external claw extractor is mounted in the slide, while the fixed ejector - inside the pistol’s frame. The BDA is secured against unintentional firing with an automatic firing pin safety which blocks the firing pin and is released only when the trigger is pulled to fire. Immediately after a round is fired, the safety reengages itself even if the trigger is not released. The BDA also has a decocking safety that safely releases and captures the hammer in a safety notch. A decocking lever is mounted {{on each side of}} the pistol’s frame.|$|E

40|$|Flying insects have {{developed}} a remarkably sensitive olfactory system to detect faint and turbulent odor traces. This ability {{is linked to the}} olfactory receptors class of odorant receptors (ORs), occurring exclusively in winged insects. ORs form heteromeric complexes of an odorant specific receptor protein (OrX) and a highly conserved co-receptor protein (Orco). The ORs form ligand gated ion channels that are tuned by intracellular signaling systems. Repetitive subthreshold odor stimulation of olfactory sensory neurons sensitizes insect ORs. This OR sensitization process requires Orco activity. In the present study we first asked whether OR sensitization can be monitored with heterologously expressed OR proteins. Using electrophysiological and calcium imaging methods we demonstrate that D. melanogaster OR proteins expressed in CHO cells show sensitization upon repeated weak stimulation. This was found for OR channels formed by Orco as well as by Or 22 a or Or 56 a and Orco. Moreover, we show that inhibition of calmodulin (<b>CaM)</b> <b>action</b> on OR proteins, expressed in CHO cells, abolishes any sensitization. Finally, we investigated the sensitization phenomenon using an ex vivo preparation of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) expressing Or 22 a inside the fly’s antenna. Using calcium imaging, we observed sensitization in the dendrites {{as well as in the}} soma. Inhibition of calmodulin with W 7 disrupted the sensitization within the outer dendritic shaft, whereas the sensitization remained in the other OSN compartments. Taken together, our results suggest that <b>CaM</b> <b>action</b> is involved in sensitizing the OR complex and that this mechanisms accounts for the sensitization in the outer dendrites, whereas further mechanisms contribute to the sensitization observed in the other OSN compartments. The use of heterologously expressed OR proteins appears to be suitable for further investigations on the mechanistic basis of OR sensitization, while investigations on native neurons are required to study the presently unknown additional mechanisms involved in OSN sensitization...|$|R

50|$|The USP is a {{semi-automatic}} pistol with a {{mechanically locked}} breech using the short recoil method of operation. This rather conventional lock-up system {{has a large}} rectangular lug over the barrel’s chamber that rides into and engages the ejection port cut-out in the slide. When a cartridge is fired, pressures generated by the ignited powder drive the cartridge casing back against the breech face on the slide, driving back both the barrel and slide as they remain locked together in the manner described above. After 3 mm of unrestricted rearward travel, the projectile has left the barrel and gas pressures have dropped to a safe level. A shaped lug {{on the underside of}} the barrel chamber comes into contact with a hooked locking block at the end of the steel recoil spring guide rod, lowering the rear end of the barrel and stopping the barrel's rearward movement. The recoil spring assembly is held in place by the slide stop lever’s axis pin and a round cut-out at the front of the slide. For enhanced reliability in high-dust environments, the locking surface on the front top of the barrel’s locking lug is tapered with a forward slope. This tapered surface produces a <b>camming</b> <b>action</b> which assists in positive lock-up in the presence of heavy fouling and debris. In this way, the USP shares many design features with the M1911 pistol, although apparently updated for easier operation.|$|E
50|$|The M86 antipersonnel mine is {{manually}} armed {{by removing}} the safety clip and then the arming strap assembly. A <b>camming</b> <b>action</b> breaks the shorting bar and forces the battery ball against the battery breaking the glass ampule containing an electrolyte which activates the reserve battery and provides power. The shorting bar hook, attached to the cam, shears the shorting bar (a safety device across the detonator). After a 60-second (nominal) electronic time delay, a piston actuator in the Safe and Arm mechanism is electrically fired, moving a slider to align the detonator with an explosive lead in the slider. At the same time, seven sensor triplines are released. Approximately three or four triplines will deploy up to 20 feet from the mine, depending upon the at-rest position of the mine. The remaining triplines may be hindered due to their proximity to the resting surface. After an additional 10-second electronic time delay, allowing the munition to return to equilibrium, the mine is fully armed electronically. Disturbance of a tripline, or the mine itself, now triggers a switch which completes an electronic firing circuit. The S&A electric detonator initiates the S&A firing train which initiates a detonating cord which the initiates {{a thin layer of}} liquid propellant, which by gravity rests under the kill mechanism, shattering the plastic mine body and propelling the kill mechanism upwards from 6 inches to 8 feet above the ground where it detonates.

By two-step cam switch, the throttle action is separated from the <b>cam</b> <b>action,</b> which ensures the stabilization of mode transition. For validating the feasibility of the stepped switch, the influence of throttle position on HCCI combustion was carefully studied.

The entire process was smooth, rapid and reliable without any abnormal combustion such as knocking and misfiring. Copyright © 2007 SAE International...|$|R
