In his first game back, he drove in the game-winning RBI in extra innings against the Boston Red Sox. After beating the Indians in a game where he hit his 611th career home run, Thome said, [...] "There's a lot [...] memories. I've had great memories on that side and then <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> as an opponent against them. Any time you come home, they say, it's very special. It's even more special to get the W's. That's, I think, the main thing. The bottom line is I played here a long time." [...] Orioles teammates remarked at Thome's commitment to talking about the game while in the dugout. Thome remarked, [...] "I talk the game. When I sit in the dugout during games, I talk baseball to these guys. They'll ask, 'Hey, what's this pitcher like?' or 'What about the game?' 'What about all those Indians teams you were on?' I did it to Eddie Murray {{when he was in his}} 40s." [...] The Orioles made the playoffs, but lost in five games to the Yankees during the AL Division Series. Thome hit [...]133 in the playoffs with no home runs or RBIs.|$|E
2500|$|The Lavender Hill Mob {{also criticized}} representatives of {{established}} {{lesbian and gay}} organizations attending the meeting, interrupting their joint press conference {{on the second day}} of the meeting. Urvashi Vaid was at the podium when Petrelis stood from his seat at the back of the room and shouted, [...] "You’ve sold out the gay community!" [...] Petrelis accused the community leaders of being “really out of touch” with the gay community’s frustration and anger. “After six years there has been no action. And you guys are <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> and acting as though what happened today is something to be applauded.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Titans {{running backs}} coach Earnest Byner said of Ringer “You {{can see the}} running skills, {{the things that we}} saw when we watched him at Michigan State, Good patience, good body lean, the ability to set the inside zones, acceleration, vision. Can he go in and compete on offense? Yes he can. With the way things are progressing, with the {{competition}} … that competition is going to make that third position much better." [...] When describing the role of the 3rd string running back, Jeff Fisher said [...] "The rotation is, for the most part, like it was last year, So the third running back will be called upon if the second back can’t play, and to be a good player on special teams." [...] Ringer commented on the role, saying [...] "Special teams can help you win or lose a game. My goal <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> was to be a productive player anyway possible. If special teams is it then that will be it. I know that’s {{going to be a big}} deal. I know I’ll get my chance sooner or later.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, wait! Have patience. You {{have not}} well considered, that is plain. <b>In</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> secret you wronged my father. You will not trouble to deny it.|$|R
2500|$|... "It is {{for your}} bravery, <b>in</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here,</b> living here, and working with us," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "We came <b>in</b> <b>here</b> {{not to make}} trouble," [...] went on {{the second}} Spaniard. [...] "We came to learn what the firing means. Are the Americanos <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> force?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed, {{there is}} nothing, Mr. Thorndyke. It is {{marvelous}} to us <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> and finding {{everything that we}} can possibly want." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cut it out!" [...] she cried. [...] "What {{business}} {{have you}} got <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> and straightening up? I was a fool to bring you, anyway." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do you cadets mean by <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> and {{annoying}} my daughter?" [...] {{demanded the}} storekeeper hotly. [...] "If you can't behave yourselves, {{you had better}} keep away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But weren't {{you running}} the risk <b>in</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> {{that he might}} {{recognize}} you? Wouldn't that make it rather unpleasant for you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} {{frivolous}} <b>in</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> {{with the hope}} of finding you," [...] the young man answered. [...] "That is very serious." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{think she}} is simply wicked. False, superstitious, inveterately cruel--but not mad. I believe her main motive <b>in</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> was to enjoy the luxury of {{frightening}} you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O dear, no, sir," [...] {{said the}} forlorn man. [...] "Nobody ever intrudes <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>here.</b> I'm always {{happy to see}} gentlemen,--only, mostly, I'm so bad with the gout." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must not}} think of it!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "You would simply write my death-warrant. Don't allude to that matter again. I have risked enough in <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> to sit with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not half {{so much as}} {{you worry}} me," [...] she declared. [...] "Look at the time. It's already past seven. At eight o'clock Mrs. Dory--your Maud--is <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> hoping to find her old sweetheart." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{no sense}} <b>in</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> to worry the young lady," [...] Mrs. Malony {{declared}} irritably. [...] "As for Mr. Craig, I {{told you that}} he'd gone out." ...|$|R
50|$|Alva {{considers}} {{all that}} he has left behind <b>in</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here,</b> and concludes that when his memories {{of the real world}} eventually recede into nothingness, his old life will have disappeared.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Never {{mind what}} you didn't intend,' John Westlock interposed. 'What you DID intend {{is more to}} the purpose. You intended, <b>in</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here,</b> to ask my advice, did you not, Tom?' ...|$|R
6000|$|But now {{all eyes}} at that {{end of the}} room were bent on Silas Marner; the Squire himself had risen, and asked angrily, [...] "How's this?--what's this?--what do you do <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> in this way?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{so sorry}} you are going. It has been so jolly, <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> of a Sunday, Lady Elizabeth, and you have been so good to me. I wish Scarrowby {{was at the bottom}} of the sea." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's his doing, sir. I {{mean about}} our <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>here.</b> We {{should never have}} thought {{anything}} about the cart, if it hadn't been for Bob; and we didn't much like coming, only he pretty well made us, and he arranged it all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not exactly, Jack! But {{we really}} have an object <b>in</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here.</b> Can you give us ten minutes' talk, somewhere in private? We {{want to know about}} one of your patients." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Vane grimly, [...] "I suppose I've {{done what}} my friends would {{consider}} a mad thing <b>in</b> <b>coming</b> up <b>here,</b> and I must face the reckoning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "On the contrary," [...] replied Magdalen, [...] "you have exactly {{expressed}} my meaning. My object <b>in</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> is to warn Mr. Noel Vanstone {{against the}} course {{which he is}} now taking." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some of {{the things}} that are gone are {{generally}} kept in here, Captain--the rope up to two inch, for example, and a good deal of canvas, and most of the smaller copper fittings; so that, whoever the thief is, he must have been in the habit of <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> as well as into the warehouse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There wasn't {{any other}} way to do it, and so I did it this way," [...] he said. [...] "I'm sorry, really, to have to tie you up so, because I wouldn't like it myself, and I wouldn't have put that {{handkerchief}} over your mouth if you had agreed to keep quiet, but I don't want anybody <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> until you've promised." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon, Blyth," [...] {{interrupted}} Lady Brambledown, whose sharp ears {{had caught the}} remark made on Valentine and his [...] "mixture of people," [...] and whose liberal principles were thereby instantly stimulated into publicly asserting themselves. [...] "I beg your pardon; but where's my old ally, the gardener, who was here last time?--Out at the door is he? What does he mean by not <b>coming</b> <b>in?</b> <b>Here,</b> gardener! come behind my chair." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, great king!" [...] replied Padmavati, {{with the}} most {{fascinating}} of smiles, [...] "you have taken so much trouble for my sake <b>in</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here,</b> it is right that I perform service for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Supposing," [...] she answered, {{still looking}} at him steadily, [...] "supposing I were to say that I had no object <b>in</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> at all--that it was merely a whim? What should you say then?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Willoughby, you OUGHT to feel, and I {{certainly}} DO--that {{after what}} has passed--your <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> this manner, and forcing yourself upon my notice, requires a very particular excuse.--What is it, that {{you mean by}} it?"-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh your father--he {{has been}} a nice father, {{bringing}} you up in such ideas!" [...] These words followed her with infinite scorn, but almost as Mme. de Brecourt uttered them, struck by a sound, she sprang after the girl, seized her, drew her back and held her a moment listening before she could pass out. [...] "Hush--hush--they're <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>here,</b> they're too anxious! Deny--deny it--say you know nothing! Your sister must have said things--and such things: say it all comes from HER!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A hunter {{has made}} that blind to shoot Black Ducks from," [...] thought Farmer Brown's boy, [...] "and {{he has been}} baiting them in here by {{scattering}} corn for them. Black Ducks are about the smartest Ducks that fly, but {{if they have been}} <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> every evening and finding corn and no sign of danger, they probably think it perfectly safe here and come straight in without being at all suspicious. To-night, or some night soon, that hunter will be waiting for them.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{useless to}} be playing off, in an affair like this, Captain Gar'ner," [...] said Stephen, on one occasion. [...] "Away from this spot all the navies of the 'arth could not now carry us, until God's sun comes back in his course, to drive the winter away afore it. I have my misgivin's, gentlemen, {{touching}} this great floe that has got jammed in among these islands, whether it will ever move ag'in; for I don't think its <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> is a common matter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My darling Walter," [...] she said, [...] "must {{we really}} account for our boldness <b>in</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here?</b> I am afraid, love, I can only explain it by {{breaking}} through our rule, and {{referring to the}} past." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I fear {{it will be}} necessary," [...] added Albert, [...] "that I scout abroad a little, {{and show}} myself in some distant part of the country, lest, <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> quest of me, they should find higher game." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Entirely," [...] Lutchester agreed, [...] "but {{where he}} goes wrong is that his primary object <b>in</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> was to meet Hie chief of the Japanese Secret Service, to whom {{he has made a}} {{proposition}} of precisely similar character." ...|$|R
