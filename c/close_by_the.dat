5|$|Glastonbury Methodist Church on Lambrook Street {{was built}} in 1843 and has a galleried interior, typical of a non-conformist chapel of that period, but an unusual number of stained glass windows. <b>Close</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{front of the church}} is an ancient pond, which was later covered to form a brick-arched reservoir.

5|$|Nydalen is a {{rapid transit}} {{station on the}} Ring Line of the Oslo Metro. It is located at Nydalen in the Nordre Aker borough of Oslo, Norway.

Artistic effort was put into the {{construction}} of the station, and the escalators were built into the Tunnel of Light exhibition. <b>Close</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> station is the BI Norwegian Business School (BI) campus and several large working places.|$|E
5|$|Sir Edward's {{choice of}} {{architect}} is unknown, {{although it has}} been attributed to the mason William Arnold, who was responsible for the designs of Cranborne Manor and Wadham College, Oxford, and had worked at Dunster Castle, also in Somerset. Dunster has architectural motifs similar to those found at Montacute. Phelips chose as the site for his new mansion a spot <b>close</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> existing house, built by his father. The date work commenced is undocumented, but is generally thought to be c.1598/9, based on dates on a fireplace and in stained glass within the house. The date 1601, engraved above a doorcase, is considered to be the date of completion.|$|E

5|$|When an {{infected}} person sneezes or coughs, {{more than half}} a million virus particles can be spread to those <b>close</b> <b>by.</b> <b>The</b> close quarters and massive troop movements of World War I hastened the pandemic, and probably both increased transmission and augmented mutation; the war may also have increased the lethality of the virus. Some speculate the soldiers' immune systems were weakened by malnourishment, as well as the stresses of combat and chemical attacks, increasing their susceptibility.|$|E
5|$|Although not yet ordained, Gerard {{was rewarded}} with the Bishopric of Hereford, and he was consecrated by Archbishop Anselm on 8 June 1096; his {{ordination}} as a deacon and priest had taken place the previous day. He assisted at the consecration of St Paul's Cathedral in London on 9 June 1096. He {{may have been a}} member of the hunting party in the New Forest on 2 August 1100 when Rufus was killed, as he witnessed King Henry I's coronation charter– now known as the Charter of Liberties– three days later at Winchester, <b>close</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> New Forest. Gerard was present at Henry's coronation that same day, along with Maurice, Bishop of London. Henry was probably crowned by Maurice, but the medieval chronicler Walter Map states that Gerard crowned Henry in return for a promise of the first vacant archbishopric. Gerard may have assisted Maurice in the coronation ceremony.|$|E

Waters also issued a writ for copyright {{fees for the}} band's use of the flying pig, and Pink Floyd responded by attaching a huge set of male genitalia to the balloon's underside to distinguish it from Waters' design. By November 1987, Waters gave up, and on 23 December a legal settlement was finally reached at a meeting on Astoria. Mason and Gilmour were allowed use of the Pink Floyd name in perpetuity, and Waters would be granted, among other things, rights to The Wall. However, Waters claimed {{that they would never}} have the level of success that they had during his tenure again.|$|E

5|$|Further {{confusion}} about Knútr in Scottish affairs {{comes from a}} continental source. At some point before about 1030, the eleventh-century Historiarum libri quinque, by Rodulfus Glaber (died c.1047), records that Knútr fought a long campaign against Máel Coluim, and that hostilities were finally brought to a <b>close</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> intervention of Knútr's wife, Emma (died 1052), and her brother, Richard II, Duke of Normandy (died 1026). If Rodulfus' account is to be believed, this conflict must have taken place before Richard's death in 1026, and could refer to events surrounding Máel Coluim's violent annexation of Lothian early in Knútr's reign. Despite uncertainties surrounding the reliability of Rodulfus' version of events, unless the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle has misdated Knútr's meeting in Scotland, Rodulfus' account could be evidence that Knútr involved himself with Scottish affairs before and after 1026.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1804, Emerald and her crew took part in an {{invasion}} of Surinam. The invasion force consisted of Hood's flagship , Emerald, the 44-gun heavy frigates Pandour and , the 28-gun sixth-rate , the 12-gun schooner , the 12-gun corvette , and the 8-gun Drake, together with 2,000 troops under Brigadier-General Sir Charles Green. The force arrived from Barbados on 25 April after a twenty-two-day journey. The sloop Hippomenes, a transport and a further three armed vessels, landed Brigadier-General Frederick Maitland and 700 troops at Warapee Creek {{on the night of}} 30 April. The following night, O'Bryen was ordered to assist Brigadier-general Hughes in the taking of Braam's Point. A sandbar initially prevented Emerald from entering the Surinam River but O'Bryen forced her across on the rising tide, with Pandour and Drake following. Anchoring <b>close</b> <b>by,</b> <b>the</b> three British ships quickly put the Dutch battery of 18-pounders out of action and captured the fort without loss of life.|$|E
5|$|Kenseth {{remained}} the {{leader at the}} lap-149 restart; he was followed by Gordon. The fifth caution was deployed twelve laps later when Carpentier was squeezed towards the backstretch outside wall by Newman, causing Carpentier to slide down the track and hit the inside wall. Ken Schrader was <b>close</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> incident but swerved to avoid damaging his car. During the caution, the leading drivers, including Kenseth, elected to make pit stops for tires. Gordon took the lead and maintained it at the lap-165 restart. Biffle and his teammate Kenseth drove alongside {{each other in a}} battle for second place on lap 166, until Biffle escaped and ran onto the apron on the next lap. Mayfield burst his right-front tire on lap 171, but no debris came off his car, avoiding the need for a caution. Six laps later, Biffle passed Kyle Busch to take fifth place. Riggs experienced oversteer in the fourth turn while running down the inside of Labonte; Franchitti ran into Riggs, causing the sixth caution on lap 179. All of the leaders, including Kenseth, elected to make pit stops for tires. Earnhardt led the field on the lap-183 restart; he was followed by Harvick and Edwards. Gordon moved into fifth place by lap 188. Harvick fell to fourth place when Edwards and Kenseth passed him.|$|E

The formations were moving at around three miles per minute, at 12,000 feet. Around 50 miles to the south-west, the nine Do 17s of 9 Staffel were at wave-top height, halfway between Dieppe, Seine-Maritime and Beachy Head, intent on sneaking under British radar beams unobserved. Altogether, the raiding force contained 108 bombers and 150 fighters.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} head of {{the canal}} was at Blackbridge Wharf, Winchester, just {{to the south of}} Wharf Mill, a grade II listed water mill dating from 1885, and College Walk, which spans the river at Blackbridge, an eighteenth-century stone bridge which is also grade II listed. Below the bridge, the channel splits, with the river flowing to the west and the navigation to the east. Blackbridge Wharf was accessed by Wharf Bridge, the oldest surviving bridge over the navigation, dating from the 1760s. <b>Close</b> <b>by,</b> <b>the</b> manager's house, a warehouse and some stables have also survived. The navigation flows past the grounds of Winchester College, which uses the waterway for rowing practice. The rowing eights use a winding basin just above the remains of St Catherine's Hill Lock, which now contains a modern sluice mechanism, and was the location of a water-powered sawmill, located {{to the west of the}} lock.|$|E
