50|$|The Campbell teal or <b>Campbell</b> <b>Island</b> <b>teal</b> (Anas nesiotis) is a small, flightless, nocturnal {{species of}} dabbling duck {{of the genus}} Anas endemic to the Campbell Island group of New Zealand. It is {{sometimes}} considered conspecific with the brown teal. The plumage {{is similar to that}} of the Auckland teal, dark sepia with the head and back tinged with green iridescence, and a chestnut breast on the male, with the female dark brown all over. Its natural habitat is tussock grassland dominated by Poa tussock grass, ferns and megaherbs. The species also uses the burrows and pathways of petrel species that nest on the islands. They are apparently territorial in the wild, and probably feed on amphipods and insects.|$|E
40|$|<b>Campbell</b> <b>Island</b> <b>Teal</b> (Anas nesiotis) are a {{critically}} endangered species. The wild population {{in its natural}} range may be less than 30, although a captive breeding programme {{has raised more than}} 60 birds and the species is safe from extinction in the short to medium term. Due to the isolation of, and the difficulty of access to, Dent Island in the Campbell Group, the sole surviving natural habitat, no detailed study of the behaviour and ecology of <b>Campbell</b> <b>Island</b> <b>Teal</b> in the wild has been undertaken. Although observations have been made of captive birds, the release of <b>Campbell</b> <b>Island</b> <b>Teal</b> onto Codfish Island (Whenua Hou Nature Reserve) provided the first opportunity to carry out a detailed ecological study of this species in the wild. Aspects of the ecology of <b>Campbell</b> <b>Island</b> <b>Teal</b> (Anas nesiotis) were studied following two releases onto Codfish Island in 1999 and 2000, in order to assess the success of the releases in establishing a new population. A programme was designed to monitor the attempt to establish a self sustaining population of teal on Codfish Island, and to record how captive bred birds adapted to life in the wild by observing characteristics and behaviours of the teal that allowed them to establish a successful population. This information will be used to increase the chances of any future release of this species onto Campbell Island succeeding. Birds were released at two sites on Codfish Island, with different sex and age ratios released in April 1999 and May 2000. The survival and dispersal of these birds was monitored using radio transmitters, with direct observations made on their behaviour and ecology. In these respects, <b>Campbell</b> <b>Island</b> <b>teal</b> were found to be most similar to the Auckland Island Teal (Anas aucklandica). During the three years of this study 24 birds were released, with individuals being monitored from one to three years. Forty two eggs were laid in 13 nesting attempts by eight different females, resulting in 36 ducklings hatched and 17 fledged. Only four adults are known to have died during this period although 11 other birds could not be located {{at the end of the}} study. The dispersal of the birds from their release sites varied greatly, probably influenced by habitat quality, although this was not quantified. While the inability to track some individuals may mean that dispersal was greater than recorded, of those birds which could be tracked, juvenile males dispersed the farthest with three individuals moving more than 3 km after fledging. Hatching and fledging success were influenced by the age of the females and it appears that environmental factors, especially availability of suitable damp feeding areas for ducklings, were the main factors affecting fledging success. The dispersal of the teal, their habitat preferences and breeding success provide guidelines on where birds should be released on Campbell Island and the optimum age of birds to be released. The high adult survival rate and productivity of the captive bred birds indicates that, providing sufficient are released, the teal should establish rapidly on Campbell Island...|$|E
40|$|Mitochondrial 12 S rRNA {{sequence}} {{data were}} {{used to examine the}} taxonomic status of the endemic brown, Auckland Island, and <b>Campbell</b> <b>Island</b> <b>teal.</b> Based on phylogenetic reconstructions using the 12 S rRNA data we have found that the Great Barrier Island brown teal, and the Auckland and Campbell Island teals form a discrete clade, to the exclusion of the Fiordland brown teal. All of the Fiordland brown teal sequenced show striking similarity to grey duck and mallard sequences, with which they group. It therefore seems extremely likely that the Fiordland population of brown teal have at sometime in the past hybridised extensively with these invading species. 1...|$|E

40|$|Recovery {{options are}} {{suggested}} for two endangered endemic species of waterfowl: the Auckland Island and Campbell Island teals. The distribution of both species {{is presumed to}} have been significantly reduced since the introduction of predators and competitors to each island group. The recommended recovery options for <b>Campbell</b> <b>Island</b> <b>teal</b> will, when achieved, establish at least three populations of this species compared to the one population at present and will advance the prospects of returning it to Campbell Island in the future. The recovery strategy outlined for Auckland Island teal will maintain the present situation until management techniques allow for their return to the whole of their former range.

40|$|Since the {{decimation}} of {{the southern}} right whale Eubalaena australis population in New Zealand by whaling, research on its recovery {{has focused on the}} wintering ground at the Auckland Islands, neglecting potentially important wintering habitat at <b>Campbell</b> <b>Island.</b> For the first time in 20 years we conducted an expedition to sub-Antarctic <b>Campbell</b> <b>Island</b> to document and describe E.  australis occupying this wintering habitat. We used a variety of methods including photo-identification, genetic and stable isotope analyses of tissue samples, and visual surveys of abundance and distribution, to provide details on the demography, population connectivity and ecology of E.  australis wintering at <b>Campbell</b> <b>Island.</b> Our primary findings include (1) a lack of calves observed at Campbell Island, (2) an age-class bias toward sub-adults encountered at <b>Campbell</b> <b>Island,</b> (3) nine photo-identification matches between individuals observed at <b>Campbell</b> <b>Island</b> and previously documented elsewhere in New Zealand, (4) no genetic differentiation between E. australis at Campbell Island and the broader New Zealand population, (5)  increased abundance estimates of E. australis at Campbell Island over the last 20 years, and (6) indications that E.  australis forage within the sub-Antarctic region based on stable isotope analyses. Our results confirm that the Auckland Islands are currently the only significant calving area for E. australis in New Zealand, and therefore previous abundance estimates based on demographic data from the Auckland Islands are applicable to the entire New Zealand population of E. australis. However, future periodic surveys to <b>Campbell</b> <b>Island</b> are recommended to monitor population recovery and expansion. PostprintPeer reviewe...|$|R
