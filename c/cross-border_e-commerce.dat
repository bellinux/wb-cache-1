40|$|Reducing {{transaction}} costs {{by means of}} policy intervention could generate comparative advantages {{and contribute to the}} growth of international trade. Chinese government agencies have introduced a number of policies in support of rapidly growing <b>cross-border</b> <b>e-commerce</b> to promote China’s international trade. However, the previous literature has not empirically verified the precise effect of these policies on the growth of international trade while focusing on the impact of <b>cross-border</b> <b>e-commerce</b> on trade distance and consumer welfare. To address this gap, this paper investigates the impact of <b>cross-border</b> <b>e-commerce</b> on international trade in the context of China, mainly from the perspective of transaction cost economics in conjunction with the traditional comparative advantage model by analyzing information cost, negotiation cost, transportation cost, tariffs and middlemen cost separately. Firstly, the new theoretical model suggests that <b>cross-border</b> <b>e-commerce</b> may have a positive role in promoting international trade only when the negative impact caused by tariff cost and transportation cost is offset. Secondly, our result shows that <b>cross-border</b> <b>e-commerce</b> has a positive effect on the growth of China’s international trade in each year. However, the positive effect does not show incremental growth over time, possibly {{as a result of the}} weak implementation of favorable policies in trade, in addition to global trade shrinking...|$|E

40|$|Further {{growth of}} <b>cross-border</b> <b>e-commerce</b> in the European Union markets {{requires}} improved express delivery services. The framework {{presented in this}} paper identifies relevant contextual factors that affect express delivery adoption rates in European <b>cross-border</b> <b>e-commerce.</b> This framework leads to a set of hypotheses, both on the effects of express deliveries on financial performance indicators (order incidence, order size, and repurchase rate) and on the factors that drive demand for express deliveries (consumer income, logistic costs, and lead-time benefits). A case study provides empirical tests of the hypotheses, using data on about forty thousand sales transactions from a consumer electronics manufacturer’s cross-border online shop. The findings are that express delivery has positive effects on financial performance, as it leads to higher order incidence, larger order size, and higher repurchase rates in cross-border transactions. Demand for express delivery services increases with higher income, larger lead-time benefits, and lower logistic costs. Managers can employ the presented framework to formulate and analyse their own targets for performance and express delivery services...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the economic impact}} of a change in retail technology - the shift from offline to online shopping – and a change in policy – measures to reduce the barriers to online trade perceived by consumers and retailers. Contrary to the prevalent micro-economic partial equilibrium consumer modelling approach to e-commerce, we use a macro-economic general equilibrium model that brings together the impact on consumers as well as on producers. We use survey data on <b>cross-border</b> <b>e-commerce</b> between EU Member States to estimate the implied cross-border trade cost reduction when consumers move from offline to online consumption as well as the implied costs of perceived regulatory barriers to e-commerce. We distinguish between cross-border and domestic trade costs effects. We find that <b>cross-border</b> <b>e-commerce</b> reduces trade costs compared to offline trade. Increased price competition squeezes domestic retail price margins and has a negative output effect in that sector (- 2. 6 %). However, the resulting retail efficiency gains {{have a positive effect on}} production in other sectors (between 0. 9 and 2. 6 %) and on household consumption (+ 1. 07 %). The combined macro-economic effect of these transmission channels adds 0. 14 % to EU GDP. Additional policy measures to facilitate <b>cross-border</b> <b>e-commerce</b> between EU Member States could add another 0. 3 % to household consumption and 0. 04 % to GDP, or 0. 03 % in the more conservative estimate. The relatively weak GDP effect in comparison with the production and consumption effects indicates that the shift from offline to online retail induces considerable welfare redistribution from retailing to other sectors and to households, more so than a production effect...|$|E
40|$|The {{rise of the}} {{internet}} {{is often associated with}} the “death of distance” or at least the decreasing relevance of geographical distance in the supply of information. We investigate whether distance still matters for online trade in physical goods. We use a unique dataset on online cross-border trade in goods in a linguistically fragmented EU market. The analysis confirms that distance-related trade costs are greatly reduced compared to offline trade in the same goods. However, language-related trade costs increase. Moreover, online trade introduces new sources of trade costs such as parcel delivery and online payments systems. On balance, there are no indications that online trade is less biased in favour of home market products than offline trade. We examine options available to policy makers to boost <b>cross-border</b> <b>e-commerce</b> in the EU Digital Single Market. A 1 % increase in the use of efficient and flexible cross-border payment systems could increase <b>cross-border</b> <b>e-commerce</b> by as much as 7 %.

40|$|Background:  E-commerce {{is one of}} {{the most}} dynamic and {{important}} sectors of the economy. The latest trend in this market is cross-border trade. It is based on selling products to customers who are located in other countries. However, it is connected to several problems, such as a high cost and long time of delivery, language barriers, different legal and tax conditionings, etc. 	Methods: The studies were conducted on the basis of the authors&# 39; experience in the field of e-commerce. The issue of cross-border commerce was mainly analysed with the use of reports of the European Commission. The aim of the article is to propose a conception of an integrator of <b>cross-border</b> <b>e-commerce,</b> which will make it possible, among other things, to solve logistic problems. 	Results: The article presents an authorial conception of an integrator in <b>cross-border</b> <b>e-commerce.</b> Its main task is to integrate the whole supply chain. Thanks to the economies of scale, obtained as a result of consolidation of parcels from many e-shops, the integrator is able to achieve lower delivery costs in international transport, make returns of goods more effective and serve customers from different countries better. 	Conclusions: The conception of an integrator in cross-border commerce proposed in the article may increase competitiveness of micro and small e-enterprises, especially in the international arena. Moreover, applying this conception may contribute to a rise in the attractiveness of cross-border commerce, which, as result of a greater sale level, would contribute to an increase in the total e-commerce...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore the {{barriers}} posed by the special characteristics of e-commerce that undermine consumer confidence in intra-Community crossborder e-commerce and to introduce possible substantive legal solutions to eliminate those barriers. This thesis {{is based upon the}} argument that the answer to increasing consumer confidence vis-à-vis intra-Community cross-border ecommerce lies in empowering individual consumers with effective remedies for goods with quality defects. Empirical evidence confirms that accessing rights and remedies is the principle disincentive to consumer confidence. This thesis suggests that there are two possible ways to remedy the situation; reducing the disincentive and increasing the incentive. Pinpointing key areas with reference to empirical evidence, a ‘consumer confidence enhancing package’ is introduced that contains substantive legal solutions that may have a comprehensive impact. Implementing this package, ‘accessibility of the counterparty’ and ‘localisation of disputes’ are identified as critical for improvement. Focusing on these formulas, ‘manufacturer liability’ and ‘credit card company liability’ are introduced as legal mechanisms that have the potential to reduce the disincentive of the consumers by means of facilitating accessibility of rights and remedies. The other part of the package involves the introduction of ‘punitive damages’ as a potent individual private enforcement tool for increasing the ‘incentive’ for consumers to go to courts for pursuing remedies, while fostering compliance by the businesses. It is of particular significance for the EU, to create confident consumers who engage in Intra-Community <b>cross-border</b> <b>e-commerce</b> as <b>cross-border</b> <b>e-commerce</b> is a vital motor of integration. Therefore this thesis is an attempt to develop legal mechanisms that may address the existing problems of consumer confidence in the EU, particularly in such a critical time that calls for stronger measures.
