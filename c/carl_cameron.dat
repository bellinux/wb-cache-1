He reminisced of the time, he felt the [...] "Democrat Party [...] lost its identity". He compared the Kennedy administration's failed Bay of Pigs Invasion with President Ronald Reagan's actions in El Salvador. He described Reagan's El Salvador policy as successful in advancing freedom, and noted that as he spoke, the military of El Salvador was [...] "fighting {{side by side with}} our guys (The United States military) in Iraq."

500|$|In December 2001, a Fox News report {{raised the}} concern that {{wiretapping}} equipment provided by Comverse Infosys to the U.S. government for electronic eavesdropping may have been vulnerable, as these systems allegedly had a back door through which the wiretaps could be intercepted by unauthorized parties. [...] Fox News reporter <b>Carl</b> <b>Cameron</b> {{said there was no}} reason to believe the Israeli government was implicated, but that [...] "a classified top-secret investigation is underway". [...] A March 2002 story by Le Monde recapped the Fox report and concluded: [...] "Comverse is suspected of having introduced into its systems of the 'catch gates' in order to 'intercept, record and store' these wire-taps.

[...] Fox News did not pursue the allegations, and in the years since, there have been no legal or commercial actions of any type taken against Comverse by the FBI or any other branch of the US Government related to data access and security issues. [...] While no real evidence has been presented against Comverse or Verint, the allegations have become a favorite topic of conspiracy theorists.|$|E

He ran again in 1934, trying to regain his old Senate seat but was again defeated by <b>Carl</b> Hayden. <b>Cameron</b> then left Arizona, living {{for a time in}} both Philadelphia and Los Angeles. He made a living working mining projects in Arizona, California, Georgia, and North Carolina. In 1933, Cameron divorced his first wife.

The Rebel's [...] "clean but mundane styling" [...] is a minus for collector appeal, but <b>Carl</b> <b>Cameron,</b> an automobile designer at Chrysler and developer of the original Dodge Charger fastback, mentioned that the best competitors during the late 1960s were the AMCs with new engines and the Rambler Rebels were [...] "really nice, very hot cars", but the company just did not have much of a presence in the marketplace.|$|E

5000|$|In 2004, {{a federal}} {{investigation}} concluded that Shelby revealed classified information to the media {{when he was a}} member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Specifically, Shelby revealed classified information on June 19, 2002 to <b>Carl</b> <b>Cameron,</b> the chief political correspondent on Fox News. The information consisted of two messages intercepted by the National Security Agency on September 10, 2001, but not translated until the day after the attacks—"the match is about to begin" [...] and [...] "tomorrow is zero hour." [...] The Department of Justice declined to file criminal charges against Shelby and transferred the case to the Senate Ethics Committee. It dismissed its probe into the alleged leak.|$|E

50|$|Exterior {{design was}} done by <b>Carl</b> <b>Cameron,</b> who also did the {{exterior}} for the 1966 Dodge Charger. Cameron based the 1970 Challenger grille off an older sketch of his 1966 Charger prototype that {{was to have a}} turbine engine. The Charger never got the turbine, but the Challenger featured that car's grille. Although the Challenger was well received by the public (with 76,935 produced for the 1970 model year), it was criticized by the press, and the pony car segment was already declining by the time the Challenger arrived. Sales fell dramatically after 1970, and though sales rose for the 1973 model year with over 27,800 cars being sold, Challenger production ceased midway through the 1974 model year. A total of 165,437 Challengers were sold over this generation's lifespan.|$|E
5000|$|When George W. Bush took office, {{there was}} {{a change in the}} West Wing; {{television}} sets that were almost always tuned to CNN during the Clinton years were now on Fox News Channel, whose political talk shows are dominated by conservative commentators. And after eight years of feeling frozen out, reporters from news outlets with conservative programming are winning a much friendlier reception from Bush and his aides. The shift started on the campaign trail. Bush's audiences occasionally booed CNN reporter Candy Crowley and held up signs slamming the [...] "Clinton News Network." [...] Sometimes they cheered <b>Carl</b> <b>Cameron</b> of Fox News. [...] "It was flattering and unsettling. It suggested a perception that I would often disabuse people of." [...] Fox News reporters warmly received on the campaign trail are getting more access to top aides. It's part of a strategy to get more coverage - and more positive coverage - by spending time with right-leaning and outside-the-Washington-beltway journalists. In the Clinton White House, press secretaries were sometimes dismissive of reporters from conservative newspapers and stations - or they ignored them.|$|E

5000|$|In June 2004, CEO Roger Ailes {{responded to}} some of the {{criticism}} with a rebuttal in an editorial in the Wall Street Journal's OpinionJournal, saying that Fox's critics intentionally confuse opinion shows such as The O'Reilly Factor with regular news coverage. Ailes stated that Fox News has broken stories harmful to Republicans, offering [...] "Fox News is the network that broke George W. Bush's DUI four days before the election" [...] as an example, referring to Bush's DUI charge in 1976 that had not yet been made public. The DUI story was broken by then-Fox affiliate WPXT in Portland, Maine, although Fox News correspondent <b>Carl</b> <b>Cameron</b> also contributed to the report and, in the words of National Public Radio ombudsman Alicia Shepard, Fox News Channel [...] "sent the story ping-ponging around the nation" [...] by broadcasting WPXT's coverage. WPXT News Director Kevin Kelly said that he [...] "called Fox News in New York City to see if we were flogging a dead horse" [...] before running the story, and that Fox News Channel confirmed the arrest with the campaign and ran the story shortly after 6 p.m.|$|E

Diane gets {{off the phone with}} Debbie and tells Ashley that they've decided to call the baby boy Jack Sugden. Chas rushes back into the pub. Carl, still wounded from Chas' attack on him, struggles to sit up. He manages to find his phone and loads the picture of Cameron and Chas in bed {{together}} and presses 'Send'.

He immediately stalled campaigning for a short period to help his constituents with the recovery effort.Hunter criticized those who connected the wildfires to the lack of resources because of the War in Iraq. He argued those conclusions were invalid because of San Diego's direct access to troops, helicopters and equipment.

5000|$|The first {{televised}} gubernatorial {{debate of}} the 2010 campaign {{took place on}} October 5, moderated by Fox News Channel chief political correspondent <b>Carl</b> <b>Cameron</b> and aired live on Fox Connecticut. Among other things in the debate {{in which the two}} opponents [...] "clashed sharply," [...] Foley voiced his support for retaining Connecticut's death penalty as is, pledging to veto abolishment bills placed on his desk as governor, while Malloy reiterated his opposition to capital punishment, though he stated he would not retroactively undo death sentences of individuals currently in the process. The candidates also took issue with each other's records, with Malloy accusing Foley of mismanagement while CEO of a Georgia textile mill and Foley labeling Malloy as a career politician who presided as mayor of Stamford during years in which the city had net job losses. State labor department figures have shown Stamford to have lost more than 5,000 net jobs during the 14-year period of Malloy's tenure as mayor. The Republican and the Democrat also took issue with statements and actions taken during the election season, with Foley stating that Malloy's pledge to cut gubernatorial staff by 15 percent would amount to only approximately five positions being cut and Malloy criticizing Foley for not naming a preferred running mate for the position of lieutenant governor. Malloy clarified that he had meant cutting from all positions the governor has a role in filling, stating that [...] "about 600" [...] positions was the real figure. Foley responded to Malloy's questioning over his running mate by stating that Republican primary voters placed Danbury mayor Mark Boughton in the position as Republican nominee for lieutenant governor, not him, but praised Boughton's experience.|$|E
