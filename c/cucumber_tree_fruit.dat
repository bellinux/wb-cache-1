Many trees, plants, and wildlife in Southern Ontario are not found anywhere else in Canada. Some rare trees to Canada in this region include the tulip <b>tree,</b> pawpaw <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> and the <b>cucumber</b> <b>tree.</b> The Carolinian forests of Southern Ontario have in large part been destroyed by development sprawl. Very few original growth areas remain.|$|R

40|$|Consumer {{demand for}} organic <b>tree</b> <b>fruit</b> {{products}} in Europe and North America, the dominant organic food markets, has spurred increases in organic area and production globally. From 2008 – 2013, {{the area of}} production grew 109 %, 42 %, and 53 % for organic temperate <b>tree</b> <b>fruits,</b> citrus, and tropical/subtropical fruits, respectively, with much lower growth for total area (non-organic plus organic) in these categories. Most organic <b>tree</b> <b>fruits</b> represent approximately 1 – 2 % of total production area for a specific fruit; avocado is the exception, with 8 % of avocado area worldwide under organic management. Mexico, Italy, and China are the top three countries in terms of organic <b>tree</b> <b>fruit</b> area, but not all countries segregate <b>tree</b> <b>fruit</b> crops in the organic statistics they report. Organic standards are not identical among countries, although over 90 % of organic sales are in the USA and EU where standards are harmonized. Published data on the relative yield of organic to conventional <b>tree</b> <b>fruits</b> are scarce and range from 42 % to 126 % of conventional yields. Reported production costs for organic <b>tree</b> <b>fruits</b> were generally higher than conventional, with higher cost for fertilizers a frequent reason. Higher selling prices for organic <b>tree</b> <b>fruits</b> were able to compensate for lower yields and higher costs in most cases, leading to a higher net return under certified organic management. Key technological advances, such as pheromone mating disruption, have been critical {{to the expansion of}} organic <b>tree</b> <b>fruit</b> production, and more innovation will be needed in the future to address new challenges involving invasive pests and climate change, as well as disease-resistance cultivars and new pest control tools to enable production in areas not currently involved in the organic market...|$|R

" The abstract for the latter notes: Organic certification of <b>tree</b> <b>fruit</b> in Washington State began in 1988 with the establishment of the Organic Food Program (OFP) in the Washington State Dept. of Agriculture. We have been compiling statistical data on the organic sector in the state using their data (Granatstein and Dauer, 2000; Granatstein and Kirby, 2002). Our goal is to produce an annual update of organic <b>tree</b> <b>fruit</b> acreage in the state to provide growers and the industry with current information on these crops to aid in their business decisions. Modest changes in production acres can have significant impacts on the marketplace, and thus current information is essential. Also, our reporting provides a level of detail not available elsewhere, and knowing the trend by variety, for example, Red Delicious versus Gala, is critical, while data for generic ‘organic apples’ will be minimally useful for working in the fresh pack arena.

40|$|Objectives Shea tree is a {{multi-purpose}} tree daily used by rural African communities. Economic {{importance of}} Shea <b>tree</b> <b>fruits</b> {{has been rising}} and achieving a great success in African, American and European markets. Shea butter is used mainly in chocolate industry, cosmetic or pharmacological products. Traceability {{is now one of}} the great concerns of the customers and the lawyers. In view of the difficulties of installing these documentary systems in developing country particularly the countries of sub-Saharan Africa, the new strategies of traceability emerge. Methods Molecular technique using 28 S rDNA profiles generated by polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to detect the variation in fungal community structures of Shea <b>tree</b> <b>fruit</b> from Senegal, Mali and Cameroon. Results 28 S rDNA profiles were analysed by multivariate analysis, distinct microbial communities were detected. Band profiles of Shea <b>tree</b> <b>fruit</b> fungi from different countries were specific for each location and could be used as a bar code to discriminate the origin of fruits. Conclusion We propose the polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis method as the fingerprinting of Shea <b>tree</b> <b>fruits</b> using 28 S rDNA of fungi that provides the fruits with a unique bar code and make it possible to trace back the Shea <b>tree</b> <b>fruit</b> to their original locations.

40|$|Organic food {{sales in}} the U. S. and other coun-tries {{continue}} to grow at an estimated 20 to 25 % per year. This has occurred for the past 10 years and {{shows no sign of}} abating (Fig. 1). The Organic Trade Association estimates that U. S. sales will grow to $ 20 billion by the year 2005. It is less clear where organic <b>tree</b> <b>fruit</b> sits relative to the overall sector growth, as no statis-tics are readily available. Thus, we can only guess whether consumption of organic apples, for example, is above or below the overall growth rate. However, a 2001 survey by The Packer (2002) found that organic apples were the most frequent produce choice of organic consumers. The acreage of organic production in Wash-ington State also continues to expand in response to market growth. The major crop groups are list-ed in Table 1. <b>Tree</b> <b>fruit</b> accounts for about 25 % of the certified land and shows much more growth potential than other crops based on the transition acres. Production of all crops, including <b>tree</b> <b>fruit,</b> is largely based in the irrigated region of central Washington.
