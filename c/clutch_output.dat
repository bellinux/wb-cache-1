40|$|Energy {{management}} strategies (EMSs) in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) are highly {{related to the}} fuel economy and emission performances. However, EMS constitutes a challenging problem due to the complex structure of a HEV and the unknown or partially known driving cycles. To meet this problem, this paper adopts a stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) method for the EMS of a specially designed vehicle, a pre-transmission single-shaft torque-coupling parallel HEV. In this parallel HEV, the auto <b>clutch</b> <b>output</b> {{is connected to the}} transmission input through an electric motor, which benefits an efficient motor assist operation. In this EMS, demanded torque of driver is modeled as a one-state Markov process to represent the uncertainty of future driving situations. The obtained EMS has been evaluated with ADVISOR 2002 over two standard government drive cycles and a self-defined one, and compared with a dynamic programming (DP) one and a rule-based one. Simulation results have shown the real-time performance of the proposed approach, and potential vehicle performance improvement relative to the rule-based one...|$|E

40|$|Wet {{clutches}} are {{machine components}} using friction to transfer torque and providing interruptible connection between rotating shafts in different automobile applications including automatic transmissions. Like any friction generating machine components, wet clutches {{are susceptible to}} continuous wear and degradation during sliding. This regular deterioration process {{as well as the}} choice of operating conditions, ultimately change the overall system performance during operation due to resultant change in the system parameters. The first part of this thesis summarizes some of the notable studies on the wet clutch tribological performance and clarifies goals of the investigation. Previously, plenty of experimental studies on wet clutches have been reported but still some effects regarding the water contamination problem and the influence of mechanical design factors are not covered thoroughly. The thesis aims to experimentally analyse these two different aspects for improving wet clutch performance regarding frictional characteristics and reliability. These two investigations are focused on wet clutches in automatic transmission applications. For evaluating friction behaviour during a long clutch engagement period, suitable test equipment is designed where standard paper based friction plates and steel separator plates are tested with commercially available ATF. To investigate a clutch operated in a controlled environment is one of main the research objectives. The vital concern while designing the test rig is to monitor the clutch parameters for achieving the desired operating conditions for individual tests. Instead of using a multiple clutch plate configuration, as in real applications, a single friction and reaction plate arrangement is considered to simplify the analyses. An experimental study on wet clutch frictional behaviour under water contaminated lubrication condition reveals the change in the friction level for a water contaminated lubricant. It was shown that the friction level increased for the addition of water in the system. This is not a desirable clutch frictional behaviour for maintaining frictional stability. The increase of friction for added water was influenced by the water amount but not by the water exposure time. The test results also showed a higher change in the separator plate's roughness parameter (Ra) for water contaminated systems compared to an uncontaminated wet clutch. In the second part of this thesis, the influence of the <b>clutch’s</b> <b>output</b> shaft’s stiffness and inertia on the clutch system‘s friction reliability is experimentally evaluated. Test results show that the choice of these design factors can provide different outcome concerning clutch frictional performance and shudder sensitivity. Shudder tendency is seen to be increased for decreased torsion shaft stiffness. High frictional losses and clutch degradation are observed for systems with less inertia.

Gearbox output speed and torque as well as drive motor speed and current were compared to those from the analytical predictions. The experiments correlate very well with the predictions, thus validating the dynamic simulation methodologies...|$|R

40|$|We {{collected}} gravid gray rat snakes Ptyas korros {{from three}} geographically distinct populations in China, Chenzhou (CZ), Jiangshan (JS) and Dinghai (DH), to study geographical variation in female reproductive traits. Egg-laying dates differed {{among the three}} populations such that at the most northern latitude egg-laying was latest, and earliest at the most southern latitutde. Clutch size, clutch mass, egg mass, egg shape, within clutch variability in egg sizes and relative clutch mass differed among the three populations, whereas post-oviposition body mass did not. Except for egg-laying date, none of the traits examined varied in a geographically continuous trend. CZ and DH females, although separated by a distance of approximately 1100 km as the crow flies, were similar in nearly all traits examined. JS females were distinguished from CZ and DH females by their higher fecundity (clutch size), greater reproductive <b>output</b> (<b>clutch</b> mass) and more rounded eggs. Our data do not validate the prediction that larger offspring should be produced in colder localities.

40|$|A female's {{reproductive}} output (size {{and number of}} offspring) may say little about her reproductive success; the 'quality' of her progeny and {{the time that they}} are produced may be more important in this respect. We marked and released 1224 hatchling water pythons (Liasis fuscus) from 116 clutches of laboratory-incubated eggs, in a study site in tropical Australia. Clutches varied widely in the number of eggs, mean offspring sizes, the proportion of eggs that hatched, and recapture rates of offspring. Clutch size was not significantly correlated with the number of recaptured hatchlings in either year, nor was mean offspring size related to recapture probability. Instead, offspring recapture rates varied {{as a function of the}} time of hatching. Recapture rates were higher for hatchlings released in a year with high prey availability than in a year with few prey. In addition, recapture rates were higher for earlier-hatching clutches in the year with few prey. The other significant effect on recapture rates involved offspring viability: some clutches had a much higher proportion of surviving offspring than did others, and recapture rates were higher from clutches with higher hatching success (i. e. proportion of eggs hatching). Hence, the usual measures of reproductive <b>output</b> (<b>clutch</b> size and offspring size) offer only a poor index of a female's reproductive success in this system...|$|R
40|$|For over a {{half century}} {{numerous}} hypotheses have surfaced aimed at explaining a key life history trait, the evolution of clutch size in birds. A principal goal has been to explain why clutch size generally increases with latitude both within species and among closely related species. Most hypotheses have stressed food limitation, predation, or seasonality. I present a novel hypothesis to explain geographic variation: a limitation of calcium resulting from broad scale variation in this element. Because the storage capacity of avian medullary bone is limited or nonexistent, during egg formation, female birds must intake supplemental calcium. Yet calcium and other exchangeable bases are much rarer in tropical soils. I briefly review the abundant experimental and observational evidence supporting how calcium limitation affects clutch size and other life history traits, and I present a series of predictions (and apparent support for them), stemming from the calcium variation and limitation hypothesis. The balance of evidence suggests that variability in availability of environmental calcium plays a proximate and ultimate role {{in the evolution of}} clutch size. Although this hypothesis is not mutually exclusive with others, it highlights another factor that needs to be considered in studies of the geographic variation in <b>clutch</b> size. Reproductive <b>output</b> is a fundamental target of natural selection and is thus a key to our understanding o...|$|R

Body size differed between reproductive and non reproductive females in Camp Darby, but not in San Rossore females. Shell volume did not vary among years, nor between localities, nor between reproductive status. Reproductive females had higher body condition indices (BCI) than did non-reproductive females, while BCI did not differ between females laying one clutch and females laying multiple clutches. Clutch size did not vary among years. One clutch per year was much more frequent than multiple clutches, and multiple clutches were more frequent in Camp Darby than in San Rossore females, likely {{due to differences in}} population structures between sites...|$|R
40|$|Wet {{clutches}} are lubricated {{machine components}} which utilize friction to transfer torque and thus establish connection between shafts rotating at different speeds. They {{are used in}} automatic transmission as shifting device or lockup clutch. As well as cooling the contacting surfaces, the lubrication provides controlled friction, smooth performance and long life. Because of this advantage, wet clutches are applicable for heavy duty vehicles (e. g. construction equipment, tractors) to handle high power. However, like any other tribological system, wet clutch performance is dependent on several factors concerning operating conditions, system design etc. As a friction generating machine component, the degradation of the lubricant and the contacting clutch surfaces are continuous process and the friction behavior also changes consequently with the progression of the system deterioration and that directly influences the clutch performance. So, to investigate the clutch influencing factors and fundamental understanding of the interaction mechanism is of great interest. Though wet clutches were immensely studied earlier to investigate different issues, there was lack of clear understanding and knowledge concerning water contamination problem and the system design parameters. The main aim of this thesis is to experimentally evaluate and explain the impact of water contamination and to verify different system design parameters’ influence on wet clutch tribological performance. The study focused on the wet clutches in automatic transmissions. Initially the thesis reviews {{the state of the}} art in wet clutch research, discusses the motivation for the current research aim and clarifies the goals of the investigation. Later the details of the experimental method and findings are discussed in this thesis. Since evaluating the friction behaviour in desired environment is the key requirement, an automated wet clutch test rig was utilized to carry out the friction test where operating conditions (slip time, oil temperature, contact pressure/load, sliding speed) can be controlled and the output torque, contact temperature etc. can monitored. This suitable test equipment was designed for standard paper based friction plate and steel separator plate lubricated with automatic transmission fluid. Instead of using a multiple clutch plate configuration, as in real applications, a single friction and reaction plate arrangement is considered to simplify the analyses. In the first part of the thesis the effect of water contamination on wet clutch tribological performances is experimentally investigated. The study reveals that both the friction reliability and the friction-velocity relation are influenced by the change in the friction behaviour for a water contaminated lubricant. It is shown that the friction level increased for the addition of water in the system. This is not a desirable clutch frictional behaviour for maintaining frictional stability. The increase of friction for added water is influenced by the water amount but not by the water exposure time. Then the study is continued for longer test to evaluate the ageing of the friction interfaces and the lubricant. Though water does not show any long term effect on water contaminated ATF as it is seen in case of friction interfaces, the short term effect in the surface active additives is observed in the current research. This finding also supported the investigation on the water contaminated friction interface degradation and the effect of water on additive adsorption of the contacting surfaces. It was found that the addition of water in ATF intensifies the mean friction coefficient, but in the long run the loss of friction much faster and high, which can in fact degrade the clutch life faster as well. Two simplified ATF was also analysed along with the commercial fully formulated ATF for investigating the water impact to get a simple and comprehensive overview of the consequence. In the second part of this thesis, the influence of the <b>clutch’s</b> <b>output</b> shaft’s stiffness and inertia on the clutch system‘s friction reliability is experimentally evaluated. Test results show that the change in the clutch frictional behaviour with time and degradation can largely influence by the choice of these design factors. This can provide different outcome concerning clutch frictional performance and shudder sensitivity. Shudder tendency is seen to be increased for decreased torsion shaft stiffness. High frictional losses and clutch degradation are observed for systems with less inertia.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{uncovered}} interspecific latitudinal gradients in abundance (population density) such that tropical species tend to be, on average, less abundant than species at higher latitudes. The causes {{of this relationship}} remain poorly studied, {{in contrast to the}} relative wealth of literature examining the relationship to latitude of other variables such as range size and body mass. We used a cross-species phylogenetic comparative approach and a spatial approach to examine three potential determining factors (distribution, reproductive output and climate) that might explain why abundance correlates with latitude, using data from 54 species of honeyeaters (Meliphagidae) in woodland environments in eastern Australia. There is a strong positive correlation between mean abundance and latitude in these birds. Reproductive <b>output</b> (<b>clutch</b> size) was positively linked to both abundance and latitude, but partial correlation analysis revealed that clutch size is not related to abundance once the effects of latitude are removed. A subsequent multiple regression model that also considered range size, clutch size and body mass showed that latitude is the only strong predictor of abundance in honeyeaters. In the separate spatial analysis, the climatic variables that we considered (temperature, rainfall and seasonality) were all strongly linked to latitude, but none served as a better predictor of abundance than latitude per se, either individually or collectively. The most intriguing result of our analyses was that the cross-species latitudinal pattern in abundance was not evident within species. This suggests an intrinsic cause of the pattern of ‘rarity in the tropics’ in Australian honeyeaters. We suggest that evolutionary age may provide a key to understanding patterns of abundance in these birds. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Hybrid {{vehicles}} {{are an important}} step toward reducing global petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Flywheel energy storage in a hybrid vehicle combines high energy density and high power density, yet requires a highly efficient continuously variable transmission with a wide operating range. This paper presents a novel solution to coupling a high-speed flywheel to the drive train of a vehicle, the switch-mode con-tinuously variable transmission (CVT). The switch-mode CVT, the mechanical analog of a boost converter from power electronics, utilizes a rapidly switching clutch to transmit energy from a flywheel to a spring, which applies a torque to the drive train. By varying the duty ratio of the <b>clutch,</b> the average <b>output</b> torque is controlled. This paper examines the feasibility of this concept by formulating a mathematical model of the switch-mode CVT, which is then placed in state-space form. The state-space formulation is leveraged to analyze the system stability and perform simple optimization of the switch time and damping rate of the spring over the first switching period. The results of this work are that a stable equilibrium does exist when {{the speed of the}} output shaft is zero, but the system will not reach and stay at a desired torque if this condition is not met, but requires continuous switching between the two states. An optimal switching time and damping ratio were found for the given parameters, where the lowest error occurred with low values of damping ratio. This work builds a foundation for future work in increasing the complexity of the model and the optimization method. DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4003373...|$|R

40|$|The Silver Gull {{is a small}} gull (265 - 450 g), which {{exhibits}} sexual dimorphism, with males {{larger than}} females. It has a protracted laying period of about 8 months over the winter on Penguin Island in Western Australia. The Silver Gull was studied on Penguin Island from 2000 to 2002. Completed clutches were removed from breeding pairs to induce repeat laying {{in order to determine}} the effect of increased reproductive effort on maternal body condition, egg production ability, offspring sex ratio and chick rearing capacity. Increased egg production had no significant effect on maternal body condition as measured by condition index, derived from mass divided by a measure of skeletal size. The seasonal period, divided into thirty-day intervals, had a significant impact on female condition index, with a decline in condition toward the end of the breeding season. While male condition also appeared to decline at the end of the season, this pattern was not significant. The initiation of laying varied between the three years of the study. The earliest occurred in 2000, which also experienced earlier rainfall than the later two years. Egg size and mass decreased throughout the breeding season although the number of eggs in a clutch did not decline. The size and mass of the eggs was significantly affected by the laying history of the parents, although this effect was dependent on the year in which the eggs were produced. The minimum interval required by Silver Gulls to replace a lost clutch is about 14 days. This interval increased from the start of the breeding season, but then declined toward the end, as summer was approaching. Laying interval increased significantly as the number of clutches produced by the parents also increased, up to 4 clutches in total. As more clutches were produced past this point, the laying interval became shorter. The probability of a replacement clutch being produced after clutch removal, declined as the clutch number increased and as the season progressed. Individuals that laid clutches with a larger mean mass were more likely to lay a replacement <b>clutch.</b> Increasing reproductive <b>output</b> caused a decline in the proportion of clutches that were replaced after clutch removal. The proportion of clutches that were replaced also varied between the years with the highest rates of replacement seen in 2000 which was also the year that experienced the earliest start in laying. The size of the original clutch in terms of its mean mass and volume was related to the size of the replacement clutch, but this relationship varied according to the timing of laying. During 2000 and 2001 male offspring predominated in the first two clutches produced by Silver Gulls. Further clutches that were produced demonstrated a sex ratio skewed toward females, the smaller sex in this species. Offspring sex ratio was close to equality in 2002 with very little effect caused by increased egg production. There was no effect of year, season or the laying history of the parents on hatching success. Growth rate in chicks was influenced by the year in which the chick hatched, the period during the season in which the chicks hatched, its sex and the laying history of the parents. The relationship between chick growth and the laying history, however, was complex with no consistent pattern emerging in terms of the performance of chicks from each treatment group. While the chicks from control groups generally grew faster than the chicks from manipulated parents, those individuals that were laid or raised by manipulated parents that had laid at least three clutches in total also performed well. Using the two main measures of reproductive success in the current study, egg production and chick rearing, those birds that were induced to lay multiple replacement clutches, were able to maintain a high level of condition and reproductive success. It is proposed that in the Silver Gull, only those individuals with a high level of condition continue to lay replacement clutches. If the female is unable to produce well provisioned eggs with a high chance of success, the breeding attempt is abandoned. Despite no loss of condition detected in female Silver Gulls with increasing clutch number, there was a significant shift in the offspring sex ratio toward females, indicating that strategies were in place to cope with the increased reproductive effort incurred as a consequence of repeat laying. Protracted laying in this species allows replacement of lost clutches only after maternal condition has been regained after laying...|$|R
