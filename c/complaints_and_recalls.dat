40|$|Aim. Assessment of the {{association}} between self-reported sexual <b>complaints</b> <b>and</b> <b>recalled</b> childhood sexual adversities {{in a sample of}} psychotherapy patients. Material and methods. Coexistence of memories concerning traumatic events and minor sexual adversities and the currently present symptoms were analyzed on the basis of KO” 0 ” Symptom Checklist andLife Inventory completed prior to treatment in the day hospital for neurotic disorders. Questionnaires from 3929 psychotherapy patients were analyzed. Logistic regression analyses were performed on biographical and symptom items. Odds ratios for men and women were determined separately. Results. Associations between sexual adverse events, and current sexual health complaints, as estimated by OR coefficients, showed to be statistically significant. In the subgroups of patients who reported two categories of sexual adversities e. g. were both punished for masturbation and were not educated about sex, the risk of sexual complaints was further increased. Discussion. Both self-reported traumatic sexual events and sexual problems are quite common in the patient population and are strongly associated. Our study has replicated other’s findings in a large sample of outpatients suffering from neurotic disorders. Conclusions. Deficits in sex education, the trauma of incest, punishment for sexual play or masturbation, or too early or unwanted sexual initiation, are important risk factors of sexual symptoms accompanying neurotic syndromes. Results strongly suggest that studies focusing on the effects of sexual traumatic events should take into consideration the co-occurrence of multiple adversities...|$|R
40|$|This year’s MedNLP[1] has two tasks: {{de-identification}} <b>and</b> <b>complaint</b> <b>and</b> diagnosis. We {{tested both}} machine learning based methods and an ad-hoc rule-based method {{for the two}} tasks. For the de-identification task, the rule-based method got slightly higher results, while for the <b>complaint</b> <b>and</b> diagnosis task, the machine learning based method had much higher <b>recalls</b> <b>and</b> overall scores. These results suggest that these methods should be applied selectively depending {{on the nature of}} the information to be extracted, that is to say, whether it can be simply patternized or not...|$|R
40|$|History {{reveals that}} {{for more than}} three centuries after the Lord Proprietors of the Carolina {{territory}} appointed John Willoughby the first Chief Justice in 1670 judges in North Carolina have not been sanctioned for misconduct in office by the traditional methods of impeachment <b>and</b> <b>recall.</b> The first public censure came in 1975, and the first removal from office came in 1978. However, it would be a grave mistake to assume that the judges in this State for three centuries were above reproach or that they were regarded with awe-struck reverence. Recall was never used. Impeachment proceedings were instituted but never resulted in removal. There were methods other than the traditional methods of impeachment <b>and</b> <b>recall,</b> however, which were used to correct abuses by the judiciary. We will examine in this article some of the <b>complaints</b> <b>and</b> charges against judges in North Carolina, and the methods used in imposing or attempting to impose sanctions for misconduct in office before and after the creation of the North Carolina Judicial Standards Commission in 1973...|$|R

40|$|Remedial sport {{hunting of}} {{predator}}s {{is often used}} to reduce predator populations <b>and</b> associated <b>complaints</b> <b>and</b> livestock depredations. We assessed the effects of remedial sport hunting on reducing cougar <b>complaints</b> <b>and</b> livestock depredations in Washington from 2005 to 2010 (6 years). The number of complaints, livestock depredations, cougars harvested, estimated cougar populations, human population and livestock populations were calculated for all 39 counties and 136 GMUs (game management units) in Washington. The data was then analyzed using a negative binomial generalized linear model to test for the expected negative relationship between the number of <b>complaints</b> <b>and</b> depredations in the current year with the number of cougars harvested the previous year. As expected, we found that <b>complaints</b> <b>and</b> depredations were positively associated with human population, livestock population, and cougar population. However, contrary to expectations we found that <b>complaints</b> <b>and</b> depredations were most strongly associated with cougars harvested the previous year. The odds of increased <b>complaints</b> <b>and</b> livestock depredations increased dramatically (36 to 240 %) with increased cougar harvest. We suggest that increased young male immigration, social disruption of cougar populations, and associated changes in space use by cougars - caused by increased hunting resulted in the increased <b>complaints</b> <b>and</b> livestock depredations. Widespread indiscriminate hunting {{does not appear to be}} an effective preventative and remedial method for reducing predator <b>complaints</b> <b>and</b> livestock depredations...|$|R
