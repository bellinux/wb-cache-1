According to Red <b>Claws</b> general manager Jon Jennings, several D-League teams thought he had the most upside of anyone on the draft.|$|E
5|$|On February 27, Frazier was reacquired by the Maine Red <b>Claws.</b> The {{following}} day, in {{just his}} second game {{back for the}} Red <b>Claws,</b> Frazier recorded just the 10th triple-double in Red <b>Claws</b> history in a 132–111 win over the Sioux Falls Skyforce. In 32 minutes of action, he recorded 24 points, 12 rebounds and 12 assists.|$|E
5|$|On March 3, 2011, he {{returned}} to the Red <b>Claws.</b> He played 13 more games with the Red <b>Claws</b> before he was called up to the Atlanta Hawks. Overall, he averaged 14.1 points and 5.5 rebounds in 25.9 minutes per game with the Red <b>Claws.</b>|$|E
50|$|The final <b>Claw</b> to face Honey is the {{seemingly}} androgynous Black <b>Claw</b> (played by Mitsuhiro Oikawa). Black <b>Claw</b> is duochromatic (black and white) and fights with a spinning sword attack and a hidden microphone. During the fight Panther <b>Claw's</b> minions play classical Music and accompany Black <b>Claw</b> as (s)he sings. Black <b>Claw</b> is defeated when Honey uses a point blank Honey Boomerang.|$|R

5|$|The paws of the cheetah are {{narrower}} {{than those}} of other felids. The slightly curved <b>claws</b> lack a protective sheath and are weakly retractable (semi-retractable). This is a major point of difference between the cheetah and the big cats, which have fully retractable <b>claws,</b> and a similarity to canids. Additionally, the <b>claws</b> of the cheetah are shorter as well as straighter {{than those of}} other cats. Absence of protection makes the <b>claws</b> blunt; however, the large and strongly curved dewclaw is remarkably sharp.|$|E

5000|$|Shocking Shades of <b>Claw</b> Boys <b>Claw</b> is {{the debut}} studio album ({{released}} on 12" [...] vinyl) by Dutch {{rock and roll}} band <b>Claw</b> Boys <b>Claw.</b> The album was released on their own label, Hipcat records. The <b>Claw</b> Boys <b>Claw</b> had been founded in 1983 by drummer Allard Jolles, who played guitar and sang in L'Attentat, another band from the [...] "Amsterdam Guitar School". They won a talent show in November 1983 and with that money paid for three hours' worth of studio time: the result was their debut album. Released in May 1984, the album is popular despite the low sound quality, and the band becomes quite the hit in the Dutch club circuit, thanks {{in no small part}} to their energetic stage presence. After the album was released, Jolles returned to L'Attentat, though he would sporadically work with the <b>Claw</b> Boys <b>Claw,</b> producing Hitkillers/The Beast Of <b>Claw</b> Boys <b>Claw,</b> for instance.|$|R

5|$|The claw {{of a bird}} of prey; {{its primary}} hunting tool. The talons are very important; without them, most birds of prey {{would not be able}} to catch their food. Some birds also use <b>claws</b> for {{defensive}} purposes. Cassowaries use <b>claws</b> on their inner toe (digit II) for defence, and have been known to disembowel people. All birds however have <b>claws,</b> which are used as general holdfasts and protection for the tip of the digits. The hoatzin and turaco are unique among extant birds in having functional <b>claws</b> on the thumb and index finger (digit I and II) on the forelimbs as chicks, allowing them to climb trees until the adult plumage with flight feathers develop. However, several birds have a claw- or nail-like structure hidden under the feathers at the end of the hand digits, notably ostriches, emus, ducks, geese and kiwis.|$|E
5|$|The spiders {{are unique}} in the {{flexible}} and teethed hook-like <b>claws</b> on the last segments (tarsus) of their legs. These elongated <b>claws</b> resemble those of spiders in the family Gradungulidae of Australia and New Zealand, but the two families are only distantly related. Hooked tarsal <b>claws</b> are also present {{to a lesser extent}} in the unrelated genera Doryonychus of Tetragnathidae, Hetrogriffus of Thomisidae and Celaenia of Araneidae.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{points out}} that {{there are two types of}} <b>claw</b> free {{families}} with respect to a level of <b>claw</b> freeness. We formulate them as weak <b>claw</b> free families and strong <b>claw</b> free families. Then, we present sufficient conditions for each type of <b>claw</b> free families. (A similar result is known for weak <b>claw</b> free families.) They are represented as some algebraic forms of one way functions. A new example of strong <b>claw</b> free families is also given. 1 Introduction Two permutations f 0 and f 1 are said to be <b>claw</b> free if it is hard to find a pair (x; y) such that f 0 (x) = f 1 (y). [1] showed a digital signature scheme which is secure against chosen plaintext attack by introducing such <b>claw</b> free pairs. A set of permutaions of ff 0; ΔΔΔ f rΓ 1 g is called a <b>claw</b> free family if it is hard to find (x; y) such that f i (x) = f j (y) for any i and j.

5|$|Despite {{being the}} most {{distinctive}} feature of Deinonychus, the shape and curvature of the sickle claw varies between specimens. The type specimen described by Ostrom in 1969 has a strongly curved sickle claw, while a newer specimen described in 1976 had a claw with much weaker curvature, more similar in profile with the 'normal' <b>claws</b> on the remaining toes. Ostrom suggested that this difference in {{the size and shape}} of the sickle <b>claws</b> could be due to individual, sexual, or age-related variation, but admitted he could not be sure.|$|E

5|$|The {{blunt and}} short <b>claws</b> of Deinocheirus {{are similar to}} those of the therizinosaur Alxasaurus, which {{indicates}} the long arms and <b>claws</b> were used for digging and gathering plants. The blunt <b>claws</b> of the feet could have helped the animal from sinking into substrate when wading. The robust hind limbs and hip region indicates the animal moved slowly. The large size of the animal may have helped it against predators such as Tarbosaurus, but in turn it lost the running ability of other ornithomimosaurs. The long neural spines and possible tail fan may have been used for display behaviour. Deinocheirus was likely diurnal (active during the day), since the sclerotic rings of the eyes were relatively small in comparison with its skull length. The hand had good mobility relative to the lower arm, but was capable of only a limited flexing motion, unable to close in grasping.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the remiges (and alulae) of nestling hoatzins is much delayed compared to the {{development of}} these feathers in other young birds, presumably because young hoatzins are equipped with <b>claws</b> on their first two digits. They use these small rounded hooks to grasp branches when clambering about in trees, and feathering on these digits would presumably interfere with that functionality. Most youngsters shed their <b>claws</b> sometime between their 70th and 100th day of life, but some retain them— though callused-over and unusable— into adulthood.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{most other}} land carnivorans, bears are plantigrade. They {{distribute}} their weight toward the hind feet, {{which makes them}} look lumbering when they walk. They are capable of bursts of speed but soon tire, {{and as a result}} mostly rely on ambush rather than the chase. Bears can stand on their hind feet and sit up straight with remarkable balance. Their front paws are flexible enough to grasp fruit and leaves. Bears' non-retractable <b>claws</b> are used for digging, climbing, tearing, and catching prey. The <b>claws</b> on the front feet are larger than those on the back and may be a hindrance when climbing trees; black bears are the most arboreal of the bears, and have the shortest <b>claws.</b> Pandas are unique in having a bony extension on the wrist of the front feet which acts as a thumb, and is used for gripping bamboo shoots as the animals feed.|$|E
