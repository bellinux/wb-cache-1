The handle is made of cast bronze and uses a conical steel nut to hold the blade in place. [...] The Mark I's blade was blued with a black oxide finish, the bronze handle was chemically blackened, with cast spikes on the bow of each knuckle.

It analyzes current utilization and effectiveness of the aircraft carrier, given its operational requirements with respect to identified threats as described in security and strategy statements. It can be agreed upon that the U. S. Navy requires air cover; but whether air cover should be sea-based {{in the form of}} super carriers, jeep carriers, VTOL/STOVL aircraft on many vessels, or even land-based USAF protection in littoral settings, is the question this thesis investigates. Proponents of U. S. super carriers suggest no other single asset in the U. S. military arsenal can bring as much <b>concentrated</b> <b>striking</b> power to U. S. decision makers' ability to respond to crises nearly anywhere in the world. Despite this, a fundamental question arises: What does the future hold for sea-based air power? Aircraft carriers are among the military's costliest assets. With defense budgets under close scrutiny, policymakers are under growing pressure to fully exploit military assets and to minimize the prospects that assets may be underutilized.

2500|$|Longstreet also {{received}} Bragg's order {{but did not}} act immediately. Surprised by Stewart's advance, {{he held up the}} order for the remainder of his wing. Longstreet had spent the morning attempting to arrange his lines so that his divisions from the Army of Northern Virginia would be in the front line, but these movements had resulted in the battle line confusion that had plagued Cleburne earlier. When Longstreet was finally ready, he had amassed a <b>concentrated</b> <b>striking</b> force, commanded by Maj. Gen. John Bell Hood, of three divisions, with eight brigades arranged in five lines. In the lead, Brig. Gen. Bushrod Johnson's division straddled the Brotherton Road in two echelons. They were followed by Hood's Division, now commanded by Brig. Gen. Evander M. Law, and two brigades of Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws's division, commanded by Brig. Gen. Joseph B. Kershaw. To the left of this column was Maj. Gen. Thomas C. Hindman's division. Brig. Gen. William Preston's division of Buckner's corps was in reserve behind Hindman. Longstreet's force of 10,000 men, primarily infantry, was similar in number to those he sent forward in Pickett's Charge at Gettysburg, and some historians judge that he learned the lessons of that failed assault by providing a massive, narrow column to break the enemy line. Historian Harold Knudsen has described this deployment on a narrow front as similar to the style of the German Schwerpunkt in World War II, achieving an attacker/defender ratio of 8:1. Biographer Jeffry D. Wert also cites the innovative approach that Longstreet adopted, [...] "demonstrating his skill as a battlefield commander." [...] William Glenn Robertson, however, contends that Longstreet's deployment was [...] "happenstance", and that the general's after-action report and memoirs do not demonstrate that he had a grand, three-division column in mind.|$|R

500|$|In April, North Vietnamese MiG {{fighters were}} back in the air to {{challenge}} U.S. Navy and Air Force fighter-bombers again, but they only experienced mixed results with heavy losses. As a result, between late June and early August 1967, North Vietnamese Air Force fighters were grounded several times, so their pilots could work on their training and new tactics. While the North Vietnamese pilots were undergoing training, American airpower was <b>concentrated</b> on <b>striking</b> at Hanoi’s line of communications, especially the rail lines running north-east and north-west into China, and the transportation network which linked North Vietnam’s capital with Hai Phong.
