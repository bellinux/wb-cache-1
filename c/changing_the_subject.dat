One Jackson fan recalled being {{selected from the}} audience to meet with Jackie. Backstage, she was handed {{a scrap of paper}} with an address to the location in which they were to meet. Michael approached her from behind and warned her that his brothers did not treat women right and that his brother only wanted to use her for sex. <b>Changing</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject,</b> the female fan asked for the pop star's autograph, which request he obliged in addition to writing, [...] "Please, don't go". The woman ignored Michael's request and headed to the Jacksons' apartment complex, where she had sex with Jackie. Afterward, Jackie informed the woman that they would not meet again. Ashamed and upset, the fan left the apartment in tears.|$|E

40|$|This study uses {{a design}} based {{approach}} which {{is focused on}} the human dimension in all its complexity to give value not only to a functional or rational use of spaces, but also to an experiential one, gaining further significant inspiration from the memory layered in complex historical spaces. Interestingly, psychological studies highlight the collective base characterizing a number of disorders and suggest that <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> outside world can be just as therapeutic as <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject’s</b> feelings, indicating that psychology merges with ecology. From an intersection between design, psychology and restoration, emphasizing a cultural inclination more than a technicistic attitude, opportunities seem to develop to promote beauty, identity and memory as essential dimensions for collective and individual well-being. Design oriented processes could bring out the potential of the built environment, promoting multiple functions and reuse methods, inspired by quality and capable of creating hospitable and welcoming physical and relational spaces...|$|R

30|$|Needless to add, the {{possibility}} of measuring the in-shoe pressure and shear force directly using various footwear represented great progress. A typical indication of the progress {{is the absence of}} significant difference between the peak shear forces of subjects with and without callus when walking barefoot, although subjects with callus exhibited significantly higher peak shear forces than subjects without callus when wearing their own shoes. Additionally, by <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> footwear, <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> with callus reduced the peak shear to almost the same value of subjects without callus.|$|R
40|$|Pulse wave {{velocity}} (PWV) has been recommended as an arterial damage assessment tool and a surrogate of arterial stiffness. However, the current technology {{does not allow}} to measure PWV both continuously and in real-time. We reported previously that peripherally measured ejection time (ET) overestimates ET measured centrally. This difference in ET {{is associated with the}} inherent vascular properties of the vessel. In the current study we examined ETs derived from plethysmography simultaneously at different peripheral locations and examined the influence of the underlying arterial properties on ET prolongation by <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject's</b> position. We calculated the ET difference between two peripheral locations (ΔET) and its corresponding PWV for the same heartbeat. The ΔET increased with a corresponding decrease in PWV. The difference between ΔET in the supine and standing (which we call ET index) was higher in young subjects with low mean arterial pressure and low PWV. These results suggest that the difference in ET between two peripheral locations in the supine vs standing positions represents the underlying vascular properties. We propose ΔET in the supine position as a potential novel real-time continuous and non-invasive parameter of vascular properties, and the ET index as a potential non-invasive parameter of vascular reactivity...|$|R

50|$|Emil Hlobil, 60-year-old {{professor}} of composition at the Prague Conservatoire, {{has the most}} original creative imagination of our twelve composers, I would say. In his Quartet for harpsichord and string trio (1944) sic, he uses a fairly simple diatonic idiom, but shows a Janacek-like boldness in his apparently inconsequential <b>changing</b> of <b>the</b> <b>subject,</b> his close working-out of a few motives, {{and his ability to}} create fascinating textures. Although his self-made technique is not nearly as successful as Janacek's—his material does not stand up to so much repetition, and he sometimes falls into empty naïveté (codetta of first movement and much of the finale), this refreshingly imaginative work makes one want to hear more recent examples from his long list of compositions.|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{motivated}} {{directly by the}} very limited scope of the traditional communication strategy research in that it places exclusive emphasis on lexis and indirectly by the inadequacy of some hasty attempts, which followed the seminal work by Domyei (1995), to investigate into the effectiveness of strategy instruction without paying due attention {{to the nature of}} strategic processes involved in speech production. It focuses on <b>the</b> process of <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> grammatical <b>subject</b> (i. e. paraphrase beyond the lexical level), as a means of avoiding and/or solving problems in speech production. The process is investigated by analyzing the relationships between the original sentences and their paraphrastic counterparts given in a monolingual dictionary. The investigation identifies various ways in which linguistic elements in the original sentence are manipulated to yield a new subject...|$|R
