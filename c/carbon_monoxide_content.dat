These tools {{are used to}} study the chemical reactions, design and simulate the entire hydrogen production process, investigate the energetic and exergetic performances of the processes and perform parametric analyses (using intuitive and design of experiment-based methods). Investigating the chemical reactions of autothermal reforming (ATR) of glycerol reveals that the optimal conditions, based on maximizing the hydrogen production, minimizing the methane and <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> <b>contents</b> and eliminating coke formation at thermoneutral conditions, can be achieved at a water glycerol feed ratio (WGFR), reforming temperature (T) and oxygen-glycerol feed ratio (OGFR) of 9, 900 K and 0. 35, respectively. The energetic study of the resulting process indicates that approximately two-thirds of the energy fed to the process is recovered in the useful product (H- 2) and that the remaining incoming process energy is exhausted in the off-gas. The exergetic investigation reveals that the exergetic efficiency of the ATR process is 57 % and that 152 kJ are destroyed to generate 1 mol of hydrogen. The process operating conditions recommended by the chemical reaction investigation suffers from low performance because energetic and exergetic efficiencies are comparatively lower than values previously reported in literature for other reformates. The parametric investigation indicates that more accurate conditions are needed to convert glycerol hydrogen. These conditions ensure the lowest consumption of energy to generate a given amount of hydrogen. This paper recommends WGFR = 5. 5, T = 900 K and OGFR = 0. 96 as the optimum conditions for the entire glycerol-to-hydrogen process. For this configuration, the thermal and exergetic efficiencies are 78. 7 % and 67. 8 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHydrogen {{production}} via {{steam and}} autothermal reforming of soybean waste frying oils (WFOs) is thermodynamically investigated via the Gibbs free energy minimization method. The thermodynamic optimum conditions {{are determined to}} maximize hydrogen production while minimizing the methane and <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> <b>contents</b> and coke formation. Equilibrium calculations are performed at atmospheric pressure {{over a wide range}} of temperatures (400 - 1200 degrees C), steam-to-WFO ratios (S/C: 1 - 15) and oxygen-to-WFO ratios (O/C: 0. 0 - 2. 0). The baseline case used for the study considers soybean WFO after 8 h of use (WFO 8). The influence of frying time on the performance of reforming reactors is also discussed. The results show that the optimum conditions for steam reforming can be achieved at reforming temperatures between 650 degrees C and 850 degrees C and at a steam to carbon molar (S/C) ratio of approximately 5. The recommended operation conditions for the SR of WFO 8 are proposed to be T = 650 degrees C and S/C ratio = 5. Under these conditions, a hydrogen yield of 169. 83 mol/kg WFO 8 can be obtained with a CO concentration in the SG of 3. 91 % and trace CH 4 (0. 03 %), without the risk of coke formation. Hydrogen production from autothermal systems can be optimized at temperatures of 600 - 800 degrees C, S/C ratios of 3 - 5, and O/C ratios of 0. 0 - 0. 5.

The fine suspended particles were measured according to the black smoke index (BS), with a flow controlled portable pump provided with a cellulose filter.
