40|$|The {{processing}} of wood to yield such varied products as paper, paperboard, lumber, plywood, and reconstituted building board {{ranks among the}} ten largest industrial activi-ties in the United States. To produce paper or paperboard, the <b>wood</b> is first <b>pulped.</b> Pulps are made from wood chips, whole tree chips, sawmill residues, or logs. Pulps can be produced through chemical or mechanical means or {{by a combination of}} both. The pulp may then be bleached to various degrees of brightness. Finally, bleached or un-bleached pulp is processed into thick sheets of paperboard or paper. The manufacture of building boards, with a few exceptions, involves processing the wood itself into sheets or boards, with the aid of adhesives. The following material is intended to provide a broad overview of selected segments of the wood processing in-dustry. The production process, atmospheric emissions, and emission control technologies employed are described for (l), several <b>chemical</b> <b>wood</b> <b>pulping</b> processes, (2) mechani-cal <b>wood</b> <b>pulping</b> processes, and (3) paper and paperboard manufacture.

The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate where the largest potentials are to the Swedish industry decrease greenhouse gas emissions without increasing their costs. To limit the scope of the study is made by assessing the 10 largest categories of production by value sold in Sweden. The objectives are to investigate: (a) which the 10 largest categories are; (b) how much the productions of the products in the categories emit and where in the production those emissions come from; and (c) if policies or other actions can help lowering the amount emitted. For (a) statistics from Eurostat is used, for (b) an EIO-LCA database is used for most cases, but forestry is done with the help of a report on Swedish forestry emissions, while (c) is done by a literature review regarding the industries included in the study. The top 10 categories by value sold is: (1) Vehicle compression-ignition internal combustion piston engines; (2) <b>Chemical</b> <b>wood</b> <b>pulp,</b> soda or sulphate, other than dissolving grades; (3) Coniferous wood; (4) Pine wood; (5) Parts and accessories of bodies; (6) Bodies for motor vehicles including completely equipped and incomplete bodies; (7) Drive-axles with differential, non-driving axles and their parts; (8) Spruce wood and fir wood; (9) Prefabricated buildings of wood; And (10) Other parts and accessories for vehicles. Results show that <b>chemical</b> <b>wood</b> <b>pulp</b> had the largest emissions both per value produced and total. Additionally, <b>chemical</b> <b>wood</b> <b>pulp</b> is the category where the most clear cut improvements can be done. Besides, it is found that improvement possibilities exist for forestry and motor vehicle parts production, while prefabricated buildings of wood are very sustainable compared to other building methods. Suggestions are also made for policies that could decrease greenhouse gas emissions from <b>chemical</b> <b>wood</b> <b>pulp</b> and forestry. A suggestion for further investigation is to assess whether those would be better than improving existing broad policies in Sweden. ...|$|E

40|$|As a {{preliminary}} {{to the study}} of the reactions involved in the bleaching of <b>chemical</b> <b>wood</b> <b>pulps,</b> it seemed desirable to investigate the action of alkaline chlorine on various phenols analogous to those which have been isolated in degradative studies of lignins. For example, catechol and guaiacol have been obtained by zinc dust distillation (1), protocatechuic and veratric acids by alkali fusion (2, 3, 4) and vanillin and syringaldehyde by nitrobenzene oxidation (5, 6) of lignins. Accordingly, pyrogallol and, later, vanillin were chosen as simple analogs of the phenolic substances which are normally bleached. Since hypoiodite is a milder oxidizing and halogenating agent than hypochlorite, it was felt that {{a preliminary}} investigation of the action of alkaline iodine on these phenols would be more likely to yield positive results, which might be correlated later with those obtained in parallel experiments using chlorine. Extensive rate studies have revealed that the action of these hypohalites on pyrogallol and vanillin is greatly dependent on the hydroxyl ion concentration of the system and can be divided in all cases into two phases, an initial “fast”, followed by a “slow” reaction. A number of products have been isolated from these reactions at various pH levels, and some light was thrown on the nature of the reactions, whether one of oxidation or of halogenation, in the particular cases studied...|$|R
40|$|The {{colouring}} {{matter is the}} name applied to a coloured material believed {{to be present in}} <b>chemical</b> <b>wood</b> <b>pulps</b> and regarded, by workers in the field, to be of considerable importance in the bleaching of these pulps. In the production of a good quality white <b>pulp</b> from <b>wood,</b> two main steps are involved, namely the "cooking" of the wood, and the bleaching of the raw pulp obtained. [ [...] . ] Of the two main types of chemical pulps used commercially, namely, (a) acid or sulphite pulps, (prepared by heating under pressure with acid bisulphite solutions), and (b) alkaline pulps (prepared by heating under pressure with aqueous alkalies), the latter present by far the greater problem {{from the point of view}} of bleaching. Kraft pulps are especially difficult to bleach to a permanent white colour. The final colour is almost always slightly yellowish despite the fact that the "chlorine consumption" of these pulps is much larger than with sulphite and soda pulps. At this point it may be advisable to define the terms kraft and sulphate, since the careless use of these terms often leads to confusion. Sulphate pulp is produced by any alkaline "cooking" process in which the alkali lost is replaced by the addition of sodium sulphate in the regeneration of the "spent-liquor". Kraft is a type of sulphate pulp which has been intentionally undercooked to obtain a pulp of high strength. [ [...] . ...|$|R

A DNA-protective effect of lignin in mice testicular cells and mice peripheral blood lymphocytes against oxidation stress was examined using in vitro experiments. Hydrogen peroxide and visible light-excited methylene blue (MB) were used as DNA damaging agents. The isolated cells were preincubated with lignin before treatment with the oxidative agents.

40|$|International audienceDeveloping a {{methodology}} allowing the simultaneous deacidification and strengthening of paper is {{of a great}} interest for restoration and conservation purposes. To achieve this goal, a conservation treatment based on the random copolymerization of a tri-alkoxysilane with a di-alkoxysilane was developed, the latter creating linear segments inside the 3 D-network. This leads to the formation of a flexible copolymer network associated to paper and imparts its mechanical strengthening. For the purpose of deacidification the alkoxysilanes chosen also contain one amine function. The molar proportions of tri- and di- alkoxysilanes can be modified to adjust rigidity or flexibility to the system, which enables the treatment to be adapted to papers of various composition and states of degradation. Two application methods, immersion and spray, can be used at ambient temperature and pressure. In a previous study, the development of the treatments was carried out on pure cotton cellulose paper [1]. However, most papers, in particular newsprint paper, are made of mixed fibers from different pulping processes and often contain additives such as fillers and sizing. Papers containing various proportions of mechanical and <b>chemical</b> <b>wood</b> <b>pulp</b> and additives were therefore chosen and artificially aged in order to better simulate a natural degradation state. Different treatments were then applied and the main physicochemical properties of treated papers were studied (double fold resistance, zero-span tensile strength, alkaline reserve). The results showed that deacidification and alkaline reserve deposition were satisfactory and that efficient strengthening of the papers was achieved to various extents, depending on the copolymers used, their proportion and the type of paper. The stability of the treatments with time was evaluated using artificial aging, following which the most adequate treatment was applied to a degraded newsprint paper (1922) and its properties measured.
