5|$|A roadway {{was present}} along parts of today's H-58 {{by the late}} 1920s; initially, this county road was gravel or earth between Munising and Kingston Corners and {{connected}} with other roads to Grand Marais.

5|$|As {{with any}} war of such length, the {{drawn-out}} Byzantine–Arab Wars had long-lasting effects {{for both the}} Byzantine Empire and the Arab world. The Byzantines experienced extensive territorial loss, while the invading Arabs gained strong <b>control</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Middle East and Africa. The focus of the Byzantine Empire shifted from the western reconquests of Justinian to a primarily defensive position, against the Islamic armies on its eastern borders. Without Byzantine interference in the emerging Christian states of western Europe, the situation gave a huge stimulus to feudalism and economic self-sufficiency.|$|E

5|$|During John's reign, Byzantium faced many difficulties: enemies {{confronted the}} empire on all sides. An {{invasion}} of nomadic horsemen {{from the north}} threatened Byzantine <b>control</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Balkans, and the Turks were harassing Byzantine territory in Asia Minor. However, John soon proved himself just as determined and energetic as his predecessor. At the Battle of Beroia, John personally led the imperial armies against the Pecheneg invaders. With {{the aid of the}} emperor's elite troops, the Varangian Guard, the tribal horsemen were decisively crushed. The emperor's victory was so emphatic that the Pechenegs soon disappeared as an independent people.|$|E

5|$|In 1095, Byzantine emperor Alexius I {{appealed to}} Pope Urban II for help against renewed Muslim invasions in the Byzantine–Seljuk Wars, which caused Urban {{to launch the}} First Crusade aimed at aiding the Byzantine Empire and {{returning}} the Holy Land to Christian <b>control.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 11th century, strained relations between the primarily Greek church and the Latin Church separated them in the East–West Schism, partially due to conflicts over papal authority. The Fourth Crusade and the sacking of Constantinople by renegade crusaders proved the final breach.

5|$|In all Zveno configurations, all {{aircraft}} were piloted and all {{had their}} engines running — {{it was expected}} that the combined thrust would more than offset the weight and actually improve the performance of the mothership compared to conventional bombers. The fighters were rigidly attached via pyramid-shaped metal frames, with both latches controlled by the fighter pilots. (On Zveno-1, the front latches were controlled by the bomber crew, while the back latch was controlled by the pilot; this was changed to all-pilot <b>control</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next version). The original design included umbilical fuel lines which permitted the fighters to use fuel from the bomber while attached, although this was not fully implemented in practice.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{spectacular}} features of Justinian's reign was the recovery of large stretches of land around the Western Mediterranean basin that had slipped out of Imperial <b>control</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 5th century. As a Christian Roman emperor, Justinian considered it his divine duty to restore the Roman Empire to its ancient boundaries. Although he never personally took part in military campaigns, he boasted of his successes in the prefaces to his laws and had them commemorated in art. The re-conquests were in large part carried out by his general Belisarius.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to derive some pointwise second-order {{necessary}} conditions for stochastic optimal <b>controls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> general case that the control variable enters into both the drift and the diffusion terms. When the control region is convex, a pointwise second-order necessary condition for stochastic singular optimal <b>controls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> classical sense is established; while when the control region is allowed to be nonconvex, we obtain a pointwise second-order necessary condition for stochastic singular optimal <b>controls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sense of Pontryagin-type maximum principle. It is found that, quite different from the first-order necessary conditions, the correction part of the solution to the second-order adjoint equation appears <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pointwise second-order necessary conditions whenever the diffusion term depends on the control variable, even if the control region is convex.
