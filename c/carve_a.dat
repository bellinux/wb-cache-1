5|$|After their Hampstead {{home was}} hit by bomb {{shrapnel}} in September 1940, Moore and Irina moved out of London {{to live in a}} farmhouse called Hoglands in the hamlet of Perry Green near Much Hadham, Hertfordshire. This was to become Moore's home and workshop {{for the rest of his}} life. Despite acquiring significant wealth later in life, Moore never felt the need to move to larger premises and, apart from the addition of a number of outbuildings and studios, the house changed little over the years. In 1943 he received a commission from the Church of St. Matthew, Northampton, to <b>carve</b> <b>a</b> Madonna and Child; this sculpture was the first in an important series of family-group sculptures.|$|E
5|$|Determined to <b>carve</b> <b>a</b> {{career for}} herself outside teaching, in 1910 Wilkinson sat for {{and won the}} Jones Open History Scholarship, which gave her a place at Manchester University. There, she found many {{opportunities}} to extend her political activities. She joined the university's branch of the Fabian Society, and eventually became its joint secretary. She continued her suffragist work by joining the Manchester Society for Women's Suffrage, where she impressed Margaret Ashton, the first woman member of Manchester City Council, by her efforts in the North Manchester and Gorton constituencies. Through these and other campaigning activities Wilkinson met many of the contemporary leaders of the radical left—the veteran campaigner Charlotte Despard, the ILP leader William Crawford Anderson, and Beatrice and Sidney Webb among others. She also came {{under the influence of}} Walton Newbold, an older student who later became the United Kingdom's first Communist MP. The two were briefly engaged, and although this was soon broken off, they remained close political associates for many years.|$|E
5|$|Temple {{structures}} were built on foundations of stone slabs set into sand-filled trenches. Walls and other {{structures were}} built with large blocks of varying shapes. The blocks were laid in courses, usually without mortar. Each stone was dressed to fit with its neighbors, producing cuboid blocks whose uneven shapes interlocked. The interiors of walls were often built with less care, using rougher, poorer-quality stones. To build structures above ground level, the workers used construction ramps. When cutting chambers in living rock, workers excavated {{from the top}} down, carving a crawlspace near the ceiling and cutting down to the floor. Once the temple structure was complete, the rough faces of the stones were dressed to create a smooth surface. In decorating these surfaces, reliefs were carved into the stone or, if the stone was of too poor quality to <b>carve,</b> <b>a</b> layer of plaster that covered the stone surface. Reliefs were then decorated with gilding, inlay, or paint. The paints were usually mixtures of mineral pigments {{with some kind of}} adhesive, possibly natural gum.|$|E

25|$|In Dyer's story, {{a smaller}} advance group, led by Professor Lake, discovers {{the remains of}} {{fourteen}} prehistoric life-forms, previously unknown to science, and also unidentifiable as either plants or animals. Six of the specimens have been badly damaged, while another eight have been preserved in pristine condition. The specimens' stratum places them far too early on the geologic time scale for {{the features of the}} specimens to have evolved. Some fossils of Cambrian age show signs of the use of tools to <b>carve</b> <b>a</b> specimen for food.|$|E
25|$|Figure-work {{seems to}} have been universal. To <b>carve</b> <b>a</b> figure/design in wood may be not only more {{difficult}} but also less satisfactory than sculpting with marble, owing to the tendency of wood to crack, to be damaged by insects, or to suffer from changes in the atmosphere. The texture of the material, too, often proves challenging to the expression of features, especially in the classic type of youthful face. On the other hand, magnificent examples exist of the more rugged features of age: the beetling brows, the furrows and lines neutralizing the defects of the grain of the wood. In ancient work the surface may not have been of such consequence, for figures as a rule being painted for protection and especially color.|$|E
25|$|This secluded runestone {{is located}} in a grove near Väsby, Uppland, Sweden. It was raised by a Viking in {{commemoration}} of his receiving one danegeld in England. It is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr3 and, together with U 344, it has been said to be the earliest example of an Urnes style inscription in Uppland. The runic text follows a common rule to only <b>carve</b> <b>a</b> single rune for two consecutive letters, even when the letters were {{at the end of one}} word and the beginning of a second word. When the text shown as Latin characters, the transliterated runes are doubled and separate words are shown. For U 194 has three examples where this occurred, þinoftiʀ is transliterated as þino| |oftiʀ, tuknuts as tuk| |knuts, and anklanti as a| |anklanti.|$|E

25|$|By 1951, Archbishop Mariano Rossell Arellano {{found that}} it was urgent to recover the elite {{position}} of the Catholic Church in Guatemala, and for that reason he allied himself to the interests of the United Fruit Company through the National Liberation Movement and aimed to overthrow the revolutionary governments, which he branded as atheists and communists. After the consecration of the Shrine of Esquipulas (1950), and as part of the smear campaign launched against the Arbenz government, he requested sculptor Julio Urruela Vásquez to <b>carve</b> <b>a</b> replica of the Christ of Esquipulas, which was transferred to bronze in 1952 and converted the following year in symbol and banner of the national pilgrimage against Communism. This Christ was then appointed as Commander in Chief of the forces of the National Liberation Movement during the invasion of June 1954.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{proposals}} {{were made to}} <b>carve</b> <b>a</b> large sculpture in memory of General Lee on Stone Mountain, a huge rock outcropping. [...] The owners of Stone Mountain agreed to transfer title on condition the work was completed within 12years. [...] Borglum, who was, like others involved, a Ku Klux Klan member, was engaged to design the memorial, and proposed expanding it to include a colossal monument depicting Confederate warriors, with Lee, Jackson, and Confederate President Jefferson Davis leading them.|$|E
500|$|In an {{industrial}} cityscape, Spencer walks {{home with his}} groceries. He is stopped outside his apartment by the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall (Judith Anna Roberts), who informs him that his girlfriend, Mary X (Charlotte Stewart), has invited him to dinner with her family. Spencer leaves his groceries in his apartment, which is filled with piles of dirt and dead vegetation. That night, Spencer visits X's home, conversing awkwardly with her mother (Jeanne Bates). At the dinner table, he is asked to <b>carve</b> <b>a</b> chicken that X's talkative father, Bill (Allen Joseph) calls [...] "man-made"; the bird writhes on the plate and gushes blood. After dinner, Spencer is cornered by X's mother, who tries to kiss him. She tells him that X has had his child and that the two must marry. X, however, is not sure if what she bore is a child.|$|E

500|$|As Uttanka was {{returning}} to Veda's ashram, {{he decided to take}} a bath in a water tank. He left his things {{on the bank of the}} river and went to take a bath. At that time, Takshaka came there in the disguise of a naked mendicant and stole the earrings. Uttanka tried to pursue the mendicant, but Takshaka had reverted to his original form of a serpent and slithered away into a hole in the ground, reaching Naga-loka, the abode of the Nagas. Uttanka then tried to dig through the hole. Indra, the king of the gods, saw Uttanka in the process of digging and sent his weapon Vajra (thunder-bolt) to help him <b>carve</b> <b>a</b> tunnel to the realm of the Nagas. When Uttanka entered the snake world, he started praising the virtues of the snake king Takshaka and his clan, but to no avail as Takshaka was not moved to give up the earrings.|$|E
500|$|It {{had first}} been {{thought that the}} dwarfs would be {{the main focus of}} the story, and many {{sequences}} were written for the seven characters. However, at a certain point, it was decided that the main thrust of the story was provided by the relationship between the Queen and Snow White. For this reason, several sequences featuring the dwarfs were cut from the film. The first, which was animated in its entirety before being cut, showed Doc and Grumpy arguing about whether Snow White should stay with them. Another, also completely animated, would have shown the dwarfs eating soup noisily and messily; Snow White unsuccessfully attempts to teach them how to eat 'like gentlemen'. A partially animated sequence involved the dwarfs holding a [...] "lodge meeting" [...] in which they try to think of a gift for Snow White; this was to be followed by the elaborate 'bed building sequence', in which the dwarfs and the forest animals construct and <b>carve</b> <b>a</b> bed for the princess. This also was cut, as it was thought to slow down the movement of the story. The soup-eating and bed-building sequences were animated by Ward Kimball, who was sufficiently discouraged by their removal to consider leaving the studio, however Disney persuaded him to stay by promoting him to supervising animator of Jiminy Cricket in his next feature Pinocchio (1940).|$|E

2500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of World War I, there was a demand for artistic tributes to the heroes of the war, and in 1918, he was awarded a commission to <b>carve</b> <b>a</b> seven-foot granite war memorial of a French Infantryman. This sculpture, [...] Le Poilu in Saugues (Puy-de-Dome), stands on a ten-foot base in the town square. [...] He completed this work in 1921, {{and as a result}} was elected Officier de I’Instruction Publique, Paris. [...] This led to his execution of twenty-one drawings for Twenty-one Meditations, a book by Albert Rid.|$|E

Ford, the theatre's owner, insisting that his father had the hole bored so that the guard could check on the presidential party without having to open the door.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Ironically, {{although}} Ignatz {{seems to}} generally dislike Krazy, one strip shows his ancestor, Mark Antony Mouse, {{fall in love}} with Krazy's ancestor, an Egyptian cat princess (calling her his [...] "Star of the Nile"), and pay a sculptor to <b>carve</b> <b>a</b> brick with a love message. When he throws it at her, he is arrested, but she announces her love for him, and from that day on, he throws bricks at her to show his love for her (which would explain why Krazy believes that Ignatz throwing bricks is a sign of love). In another strip, Krazy kisses a sleeping Ignatz, and hearts appear above the mouse's head.|$|E

And the characters would {{be the kind of}} characters I could personally relate to: they'd be flesh and blood, they'd have their faults and foibles, they'd be fallible and feisty, and — most important of all — inside their colorful, costumed booties they'd still have feet of clay." ...|$|E

There was no cross, and White took this to mean that they had moved to Croatoan Island (now known as Hatteras Island), but he was unable to conduct a search. A massive storm was forming and his men refused to go any farther; the next day, they left.|$|E
