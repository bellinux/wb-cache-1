J. Bacteriol. 91 : 2192 – 2199. 1966. —It {{was found that}} {{synthesis of}} alkaline phosphatase (APase) correlated with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis in a partially <b>constitutive</b> <b>mutant</b> of Bacillus subtilis. When cultures of the mutant were made to undergo synchronous growth by germination of spores in an excess-phosphate medium, synthesis of APase was repressed {{at the beginning of}} DNA synthesis. If the initiation of DNA synthesis was inhibited by thymine starvation, the repression of APase was not observed. When DNA synthesis, previously initiated, was inhibited by thymine or uracil starvation, or by addition of mitomycin C, the repression was partially released at a later stage. In contrast, this correlation between repression and DNA synthesis was not observed in a repressible strain...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of carotenoids by Myxococcus xanthus requires illumination with blue light. Mutations at two loci (carA and carR) remove the blue-light requirement and cause constitutive production of carotenoids. Mutations {{at a different}} locus (carB) prevent carotenogenesis in both wild-type and <b>constitutive</b> <b>mutant</b> strains. We describe here three independent car mutations induced by insertion of Tn 5 lac, a transposon that carries a transcriptional probe for exogenous promoters. All three transposon insertions block carotenogenesis even in <b>constitutive</b> <b>mutant</b> strains. One insertion is in a previously unknown car gene {{and the other two}} are in the carB locus. One of the carB insertions expresses β-galactosidase at very low levels in the dark but is strongly activated by light. When this Tn 5 lac insertion is introduced in carA or carR mutants it expresses β-galactosidase in dark- as well as light-grown cells. We conclude that carotenogenesis in M. xanthus is activated at the level of transcription by a light-induced mechanism in which the carA and the carR loci (or their gene products) take part. The potential usefulness of M. xanthus as a simple and sensitive tool for studies in photobiology is discussed...|$|E

40|$|Mutant Pseudomonas putida strains {{that produce}} {{constitutive}} {{levels of the}} beta-ketoadipate uptake system are selected by the sequential transfer of cultures between mineral growth media supplemented with the noninducing growth substrate succinate and growth media containing beta-ketoadipate as the sole carbon and energy source. The mutant strains also produce constitutively three catabolic enzymes {{that give rise to}} beta-ketoadipate from the metabolic precursor beta-carboxy-cis, cis-muconate, and thus a single regulatory gene appears to govern the expression of the enzymes as well as the uptake system. The three enzymes that convert beta-carboxy-cis, cis-muconate to beta-ketoadipate are induced to higher levels when the orgainisms are grown with p-hydroxybenzoate (a compound that is catabolized via beta-ketoadipate); the beta-ketoadipate uptake system is partially repressed when the cells are grwon at the expense of p-hydroxybenzoate. The transferase that acts upon beta-ketoadipate remains inducible in the <b>constitutive</b> <b>mutant</b> strains. Thus a minimum of three biosynthetic controls must be exerted over the expression of the five genes. Since the regulatory mutation does not alter the expression of the gene for the transferase, the physiological target of the selection procedure appears to be mutant strains that produce the uptake system constitutively. Levels of the uptake system are higher in uninduced <b>constitutive</b> <b>mutant</b> cultures than in induced cultures of the wild type. Hence procedures analogous to the one we employed may be of general use in obtaining mutant strains that produce high levels of uptake systems...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWhen yeast strains were {{cultivated}} on maltose, {{the synthesis}} of trehalose already started in the exponential phase of growth, well before exhaustion of the sugar from the medium. This active pattern of trehalose accumulation was also observed in a maltose <b>constitutive</b> <b>mutant</b> strain growing on glucose. However, this accumulation was completely prevented by deletion of the TPS 1 gene coding for the catalytic subunit of the UDPglucose-linked trehalose- 6 -phosphate synthase, indicating that no alternative pathway for trehalose synthesis exists in yeast.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the fitness effects of four mutations (npr 1, cpr 1, cpr 5, and cpr 6) and two transgenic genotypes (NPR 1 -L and NPR 1 -H) affecting different points of the systemic acquired resistance (SAR) signaling pathway associated with pathogen defense in Arabidopsis thaliana. The npr 1 mutation, {{which resulted in a}} failure to express SAR, had no effect on fitness under growth chamber conditions, but decreased fitness in the field. The expression of NPR 1 positively correlated with the fitness in the field. Constitutive activation of SAR by cpr 1, cpr 5, and cpr 6 generally decreased fitness in the field and under two nutrient levels in two growth chamber conditions. At low-nutrient levels, fitness differences between wild type and the <b>constitutive</b> <b>mutants</b> were unchanged or reduced (especially in cpr 5). The reduced fitness of the <b>constitutive</b> <b>mutants</b> suggests that this pathway is costly, with the precise fitness consequences highly dependent on the environmental context...|$|R
40|$|Ureidosuccinic acid (USA) is an {{intermediary}} product in pyrimidine biosynthesis. When proline {{was the sole}} nitrogen source, USA uptake occurred; however, when ammonium sulfate or glutamic acid was the nitrogen source, uptake was inhibited. Thus, a ura 2 strain which does not synthesize USA would not grow when this substance was supplied on an ammonium sulfate or glutamic acid medium. Mutants are described in which uptake was constitutive on such a medium. Permeaseless mutants for USA have been found, and evidence is presented for permease specificity. It is shown that all <b>constitutive</b> <b>mutants</b> use the same transport system that is missing in the permeaseless mutant. These <b>mutants</b> are <b>constitutive</b> for two permeases: the specific USA permease and the general amino acid permease.

The kdpD gene is a separate transcription unit and is the site of mutations making expression of the kdp genes partially <b>constitutive.</b> The <b>constitutive</b> <b>mutants</b> are dominant to kdpD+ in diploids. These findings, the fact that kdpD mutations identified previously are Kdp-, and the existence of intracistronic complementation between some kdpD mutations indicate that the kdpD gene product is an oligomeric positive regulator of the kdp genes.

The MAL 43 (c) allele is constitutive and relatively insensitive to glucose repression. To understand better this unique phenotype of MAL 43 (c), we have isolated several MAL 63 (c) <b>constitutive</b> <b>mutants</b> from a MAL 6 strain.

The removal of a Mig 1 p binding site from the MAL 63 (c) promoter leads to a loss of glucose repression, imitating the phenotype of MAL 43 (c). Conversely, addition of a Mig 1 p binding site to the promoter of MAL 43 (c) converts it to glucose sensitivity.

Similarly, one class of inaA <b>constitutive</b> <b>mutants</b> that mapped to the mar region were multiply antibiotic resistant. Overexpression of marA alone on a multicopy plasmid caused high constitutive expression of inaA in a strain with an extensive (39 -kbp) marRAB deletion.

In this report we have analyzed signal transduction activities of OB-R containing the fatty mutation [OB-R(fa) ], a single amino acid substitution at position 269 (Gln → Pro) in the OB-R extracellular domain that results in the obese phenotype of the fatty rat. We find that this mutant receptor exhibits both ligand-independent transcriptional activation via interleukin 6 and hematopoietin receptor response elements and ligand-independent activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins 1 and 3.

40|$|Escherichia coli {{alkaline}} phosphatase <b>constitutive</b> <b>mutants</b> carrying a pst or a phoS mutation and a plasmid-bearing gene phoA+ excreted into the growth medium up to 50 % {{of the total}} {{alkaline phosphatase}} production. This excretion was pH dependent and did not involve drastic modifications of the cell envelope. Alkaline phosphatase accounted for 80 % of total released proteins. Amplification of gene phoA+ was {{a necessary condition for}} excretion to occur. When the beta-lactamase structural gene bla+ was coamplified with gene phoA+, both enzymes were excreted. pst-transformed excretory strains did not show the pleiotrophic phenotype previously described for lky mutants...|$|R
40|$|As {{in other}} Streptomyces species, the enzymatic {{conversion}} of D-glucose to D-fructose {{is carried out}} in Streptomyces phaeochromogenes NRRL B- 3559 by the inducible enzyme, D-xylose keto isomerase (EC 5. 3. 1. 5.). Mutants of this microorganism were selected {{for their ability to}} grow on D-lyxose (2 -epimer of D-xylose). As a result of the mutational event, the microorganism constitutively produced D-xylose isomerase. As in the parent strain, the constitutive formation of the isomerase was repressed by D-glucose. The fact that this mutant was unable to grow in low D-xylose concentrations {{in the presence of the}} D-glucose analogue, 3 -O-methylglucose, permitted the isolation of D-xylose isomerase <b>constitutive</b> <b>mutants</b> which were insensitive to D-glucose repression...|$|R
40|$|In {{wild-type}} Neurospora, {{alkaline phosphatase}} is made {{under conditions of}} phosphate limitation, but not conditions of phosphate sufficiency. Mutants at two unlinked loci, nuc- 1 and nuc- 2, do not make alkaline phosphatase under any conditions, while mutants at two quite closely linked loci, pcon and preg, make alkaline phosphatase even under conditions of phosphate sufficiency. pcon is extremely closely linked to nuc- 2. nuc- 2 and pregc (<b>constitutive)</b> <b>mutants</b> are recessive to their wild-type alleles in partial diploids {{as well as in}} heterokaryons, while pconc mutants are dominant or co-dominant. nuc- 1 is epistatic to both pconc and pregc mutants. The implications of these findings for theories of metabolic control in eukaryotes are briefly discussed...|$|R
