Methods: Different {{concentrations}} of chelate solution were administrated to mice with diabetes induced by streptozotocin. Daily oral administration of chelate solution 0. 4 mL at various concentrations (0. 32 &ndash; 0. 4 g/mL) led to reduction in water intake by the diabetic mice after 5 days of treatment, with a subsequent reduction in glucose levels observed 2 weeks later. Daily food intake was related to both chelate concentration as well as glycemia reduction. The food intake of mice treated with glucosaminic acid-cobalt (II) chelate solution was 1. 5 -fold that of untreated mice.

The ligand systems were prepared by nucleophilic ring opening of spiro[2. 4]hepta- 4, 6 -diene with lithium tert-butylphenylphosphide or lithium tert-butylcyclohexylphosphide. The anionic ligands give the respective chelate complexes by treatment with metal halide reagents. In three cases {{it was possible}} to obtain X-ray crystal structure analyses. The <b>cobalt</b> <b>chelate</b> complex undergoes oxidative addition with a dihydrosilane, the reaction results in the formation of products with three stereogenic centers at phosphorus, cobalt, and silicon, which show dynamic behavior as indicated by VTNMR. The rhodium chelate complex undergoes oxidative addition of iodomethane with diastereoselective formation of the respective Rh(iii) chelate. While diastereoselectivity caused by a planar chiral indenyl ligand or by a stereogenic carbon center in the chelate backbone has earlier been observed, this is the first case of a stereoinduction by the stereogenic phosphorus ligand. Activation energies for the rotation of cobalt and rhodium chelates have also been determined by VTNMR. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique...|$|E

40|$|The CTC {{series of}} <b>cobalt</b> <b>chelates</b> display in vitro and in vivo {{activity}} against {{herpes simplex virus}} types 1 and 2 (HSV- 1 and HSV- 2). The experiments described here identify the stage in the virus life cycle where CTC- 96 acts and demonstrate that the drug inhibits infection of susceptible cells. CTC- 96 at 50 μg/ml {{has no effect on}} adsorption of virions to Vero cell monolayers. Penetration assays reveal that CTC- 96 inhibits entry of the virus independent of gC and cellular entry receptors. This observation was supported by the failure to detect the accumulation of virus-specified proteins and α mRNA transcripts when CTC- 96 is present at the onset of infection. Moreover, virion-associated αTIF does not accumulate in the nucleus of cells infected in the presence of CTC- 96. CTC- 96 targets the initial fusion event between the virus and the cell and also inhibits cell-to-cell spread and syncytium formation. Furthermore, CTC- 96 inhibits plaque formation by varicella-zoster virus and vesicular stomatitis virus as efficiently as by HSV- 1. Collectively, these experiments suggest that CTC- 96 is a broad-spectrum inhibitor of infection by enveloped viruses and that it inhibits HSV- 1 infection at the point of membrane fusion independent of the type of virus and cellular receptors present...|$|R

In this work, based on the simple and low-cost N 5 structure tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) ligand, a class of non-precious metal catalyst is prepared from pyrolyzing <b>cobalt</b> tetraethylenepen-tamine <b>chelate</b> on carbon (CoTEPA/C) at 800 ◦C in high purity N 2.

For this catalyst, the nitrogen content is 1. 12 at % mainly in pyridinic-N form. Electrochemical results show that this catalyst has a good catalytic activity and selectivity to water (4 e reaction pathway) both in acid and alkaline electrolytes among the potential we studied. Furthermore, a better catalytic performance in terms of ORR peak potential (0. 973 V vs. RHE), onset potential, half-wave potential and selectivity to water in alkaline medium is displayed...|$|R

The D-hydantoin-hydrolyzing enzyme (DHTase) harboring a poly-His tagged residue {{was used as}} a modelprotein to be immobilized on the prepared IMAMs through the direct metal–protein interaction forces. The adsorption isotherm and the kinetic parameters Vmax, Km,app of DHTase on IMAMs were studied. Thecobalt ions chelated IMAM (Co-IMAM) was found to yield the highest specific activity of DHTase. Underthe immobilization condition, the <b>cobalt</b> ion <b>chelated</b> amount was 161. 4 ± 4. 7 mol/disk with a DHTaseactivity of 4. 1 ± 0. 1 U/disk.

40|$|Adenosylcobalamin, the {{coenzyme}} form {{of vitamin}} B 12, is one Nature’s most complex coenzyme whose de novo biogenesis proceeds along either an anaerobic or aerobic metabolic pathway.

50|$|Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) {{is used as}} a {{cofactor}} in {{a number}} of enzyme-catalysed reactions in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. The biosynthetic pathway to adenosylcobalamin from its five-carbon precursor, 5-aminolaevulinic acid, can be divided into three sections: (1) the biosynthesis of uroporphyrinogen III from 5-aminolaevulinic acid; (2) the conversion of uroporphyrinogen III into the ring-contracted, deacylated intermediate precorrin 6 or cobalt-precorrin 6; and (3) the transformation of this intermediate to form adenosylcobalamin. Cobalamin is synthesised by bacteria and archaea via two alternative routes that differ primarily in the steps of section 2 that lead to the contraction of the macrocycle and excision of the extruded carbon molecule (and its attached methyl group). One pathway (exemplified by Pseudomonas denitrificans) incorporates molecular oxygen into the macrocycle as a prerequisite to ring contraction, and has consequently been termed the aerobic pathway. The alternative, anaerobic, route (exemplified by Salmonella typhimurium) takes advantage of a <b>chelated</b> <b>cobalt</b> ion, in the absence of oxygen, to set the stage for ring contraction.|$|R

To analyze intrinsically their structure/function, their transduction mechanism, or both, these proteins are commonly expressed in cultured cells as recombinant proteins. However, {{it is not possible to}} check whether these recombinant proteins are homogeneously or heterogeneously expressed. Owing to difficulties in their purification, very few mass spectrometry studies have been performed with those proteins and even less with G-protein coupled receptors. Here we have set up a procedure that is highly compatible with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to analyze an intact histidine-tagged G-protein coupled, namely, the tachykinin NK- 1 receptor expressed in CHO cells, solubilized and purified using <b>cobalt</b> or nickel <b>chelating</b> magnetic beads. The metal-chelating magnetic beads containing the receptor were directly spotted on the MALDI plate for analysis. SDS-PAGE, combined with in-gel digestion analyzed by mass spectrometry, Western blot ((His) 6 and FLAG M 2 tags), photoaffinity labeling with a radioactive agonist, and Edman sequencing, confirmed the identity of the purified protein as the human tachykinin NK- 1 receptor.

These bacteria can potentially be used in bioremediation applications since the redox state of metals often influences both solubility and toxicity. Understanding molecular mechanisms by which metal transformations occur {{and the consequences of}} by-products that may be toxic to the organism and thus inhibitory to the overall process is significant to future applications for bioremediation. Here, we examine the ability of Shewanella oneidensis to catalyze the reduction of <b>chelated</b> <b>cobalt.</b> We describe an unexpected ramification of [Co(III) -EDTA]− reduction by S. oneidensis: the formation of a toxic by-product. We found that [Co(II) -EDTA] 2 −, the product of [Co(III) -EDTA]− respiration, inhibited the growth of S. oneidensis strain MR- 1 and that this toxicity was partially abolished by the addition of MgSO 4. We demonstrate that [Co(III) -EDTA]− reduction by S. oneidensis requires the Mtr extracellular respiratory pathway and associated pathways required to develop functional Mtr enzymes (the c-type cytochrome maturation pathway) and ensure proper localization (type II secretion). The Mtr pathway is known to be required for a variety of substrates, including some chelated and insoluble metals and organic compounds.
