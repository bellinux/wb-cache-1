40|$|An auto-focusing {{system that}} {{consists}} of a compact disk (CD) optical head and a piezoelectric translator (PZT) is developed for measuring the displacement or profile of a tested surface. The modified CD optical head provides the defocusing signal from the tested surface. The defocusing signal is then used to drive the PZT via a feedback controller. The focus spot of the optical head follows the displacement of the tested surface through {{the movement of the}} PZT. The displacement or the profile of the tested surface can be obtained through three ways with different accuracy: the integration of the focus error signal (FES), the curve of driving voltage to expansion distance of the PZT or a secondary sensing device of displacement. The resolution of the system can reach 10 nm and the accuracy is 0. 05 mu m. Some design considerations such as the control algorithm of focus servo and error analysis of the system are addressed in this paper. The measurement system and the sensor based on the <b>CD</b> <b>pickup</b> can also be applied to position sensing for robot as well as the non-contact probe for localization...|$|E

The Town Panel and Town Wagon trucks were based upon {{the design of the}} Dodge <b>C</b> Series <b>Pickup</b> trucks with round fenders and wraparound windshields. Even after the Dodge D Series pickup trucks with square fenders and flat windshields were released, the Town Wagons retained the 1958 sheet metal design of the <b>C</b> Series <b>pickups</b> and heavy-duty trucks.|$|R
25|$|Limousine pickup is {{also very}} common at the airport. Limousine drivers {{are not allowed to}} leave their {{vehicles}} at the designated pickup areas and pickup locations vary depending on the terminal. For Terminal A, the pickup location is on the arrival level, outside baggage claim, in a small parking lot across the road. For Terminal B, limousine drivers wait for their passengers inside the Terminal B Parking Garage on the lower level. At Terminal <b>C,</b> <b>pickup</b> is on the departure level at the second and third islands from the building. At Terminal E, pickup is also on the arrival level in a small parking lot across the outermost curb. For Public Safety, soliciting passengers anywhere on Logan Airport property by any ground transportation provider is punishable by a $500-dollar fine for each offense.|$|R

40|$|An {{improved}} LS-DYNA {{model of}} ¾-in. (19 -mm) diameter 3 x 7 wire rope {{commonly used in}} roadside cable guardrail installations has been developed. A Belytschko-Schwer beam element was selected along with material *MAT_ 166. Numerical noise was reduced using part stiffness damping with a coefficient of 2 %, and frequency range damping with a coefficient of 12 %. The optimum element length based on timestep, accuracy, and computational cost {{was determined to be}} between 0. 4 and 0. 8 in. (10 - 20 mm). Dynamic component tests were conducted on wire rope to determine material properties. These tests were simulated and the results compared to the physical tests. The new proposed wire rope model more accurately simulated the wire rope tension and bogie vehicle motion than other previously-developed wire rope models. The wire rope was also modeled in full-scale crash test models using a Chevrolet <b>C</b> 2500 <b>pickup</b> model, consistent with NCHRP Report No. 350 TL- 3 impact conditions. Results of the crash test and simulation were compared, and the wire rope response was determined to be accurate. Therefore the new wire rope model was determined to be an improvement over existing models of wire rope and is recommended for use in cable guardrail simulations...|$|R
5000|$|T.V. 12 (M,F,C,S); The {{precursor}} of TV41 and 51 series. Built on self standing body, the Body on Chassis solution being abandoned. One {{of the first}} utility vehicles {{to be built in}} this solutions. Appeared in 1973. Available as Van (F), <b>pickup</b> (<b>c),</b> Minibus (M). First models were available only with Petrol engine ARO L25, but later were produced with Diesel engines, mainly ARO D127 and D27. Gearbox with 4+1 gears. Payload was 1200 kg, top speed 100 km/h in all versions. Towable weight was about 1000 kg. Also available with 4x4 transmission. Suspension, both front and rear was rigid axle and leaf springs. S was the ambulance version, with modified suspensions, higher top speed due to modified gearbox. Between 1978 and 1982 this same vehicle was also manufactured in Portugal by the SEMAL company in Lisbon under the name of TAGUS TV250 4X4 Diesel who also assembled the popular PORTARO 4X4 Offroad Series until the early 1990s.|$|R
40|$|Wire rope is a versatile, flexible, {{high-strength}} member {{that is used}} in many mechanical systems. However, due to {{the complexity}} of wire rope, analytical investigations have been relatively limited. Previous attempts to create simplified models of wire rope were not validated with physical testing and used a cumbersome beam-and-shell or beam-and-solid method for simulating the wire rope. An improved LS-DYNA model of 19 -mm diameter 3 x 7 wire rope commonly used in roadside cable guardrail installations has been developed. A Belytschko-Schwer beam element was selected along with material *MAT_ 166. Since wire rope displays internal damping due to friction of strands and wires, low-frequency bending modes of wire rope were damped in the model using the LS-DYNA frequency range command, and high-frequency noise was reducing using the part stiffness damping. The optimum element length based on timestep, accuracy, and computational cost was determined to be between 0. 4 and 0. 8 in. (10 - 20 mm). Dynamic component tests were conducted on wire rope to determine material properties, and consisted of high-speed jerk tests of wire rope constrained at one end, and perpendicular impact of wire ropes constrained at both ends. These tests were simulated and the results compared to the physical tests. The new proposed wire rope model more accurately simulated the wire rope tension and bogie vehicle motion than previously-developed wire rope models. The wire rope was also modeled in full-scale crash test models using a Chevrolet <b>C</b> 2500 <b>pickup</b> model, consistent with NCHRP Report No. 350 TL- 3 impact conditions. Results of the crash test and simulation were compared, the wire rope response was determined to be accurate, though the wire ropes released from the hook bolts prematurely. Nonetheless, wire rope response, vehicle motion and trajectory were accurate. Therefore the new wire rope model was determined to be an improvement over existing models of wire rope and is recommended for use in cable guardrail simulations.

40|$|This project {{involved}} {{the design of}} a wind turbine system and the evaluation of aerodynamics performance of pickup truck with wind turbine system. Pickup truck with wind turbine models was developed using Solid Work sohare. Computer simulation (using Ansys software) was carried out to investigate the effects of wind turbine installation on aerodynamics of the pickup truck. Three pickup truck models with different wind turbine system positions i. e in front of the fiont bumper, on top of the hood and on top of the roof plus one model without the wind turbine system were simulated. The study proved that the position of the wind turbine system will change the characteristic of the air flow around the pickup truck body and affects the aerodynamic performance of the pickup truck. Without the wind turbine, the coefficient of drag <b>Cd</b> for the <b>pickup</b> truck model was 0. 345, which was computable to that of stated in Toyota Hilux specification [...] As for the model with wind turbine, the Cd obtained were 0. 345, 0. 349. 0. 353 and 0. 344 for the case of fiont bumper, hood, roof and under pickup truck respectively. Extended fiont bumper of a pickup truck was not significantly affect the aerodynamics performance of the <b>pickup</b> truck. The <b>Cd</b> obtained for the case of extended bumper was slightly lower than of the original bumper height...|$|R
40|$|Suprathermal (87 - 212 keV/e) singly charged iron, Fe+, {{has been}} {{discovered}} in and near Earth's ~ 9 - 30 Re equatorial magnetosphere using ~ 21 years of Geotail STICS (suprathermal ion composition spectrometer) data. Its detection is enhanced during higher geomagnetic and solar activity levels. Fe+, rare compared to dominant suprathermal solar wind and ionospheric origin heavy ions, might derive from one or all three candidate lower-energy sources: (A) ionospheric outflow of Fe+ escaped from ion layers near ~ 100 km altitude, or (B) charge exchange of nominal solar wind iron, Fe+≥ 7, in Earth's exosphere, or (<b>C)</b> inner source <b>pickup</b> Fe+ carried by the solar wind, likely formed by solar wind Fe interaction with near sun interplanetary dust particles. Earth's semi-permanent ionospheric Fe+ layers derive from tons of interplanetary dust particles entering Earth's atmosphere daily, and Fe+ scattered from these layers is observed up to ~ 1000 km altitude, likely escaping in strong ionospheric outflows. Using ~ 26 % of STICS's magnetosphere-dominated data when possible Fe+ 2 ions are not masked by other ions, we demonstrate that solar wind Fe charge exchange secondaries are not an obvious Fe+ source. Contemporaneous Earth flyby and cruise data from CHEMS (charge-energy-mass spectrometer) on the Cassini spacecraft, a functionally identical instrument, show that inner source pickup Fe+ is likely not important at suprathermal energies. Consequently, we suggest ionospheric Fe+ constitutes at least {{a significant portion of}} Earth's suprathermal Fe+, comparable to the situation at Saturn where suprathermal Fe+ is also likely of ionospheric origin...|$|R
40|$|The Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) {{instrument}} made {{measurements of}} Titan s plasma environment when the Cassini Orbiter {{flew through the}} moon s plasma wake October 26, 2004 (flyby TA) and December 13, 2004 (flyby TB). Preliminary CAPS ion and electron measurements from these encounters (1, 2) are compared with measurements made by the Voyager I Plasma Science Instrument (PLS). The comparisons are used to evaluate previous interpretations and predictions of the Titan plasma environment {{that have been made}} using PLS measurements (3, 4). The plasma wake trajectories of flybys TA, TB and Voyager 1 are similar because they occurred when Titan was near Saturn s local noon. These similarities make possible direct, meaningful comparisons between the various plasma wake measurements. The inquiries stimulated by the previous interpretations and predictions made using PLS data have produced the following results from the CAPS ion measurements: A) The major ambient ion components of Saturn s rotating magnetosphere in the vicinity of Titan are H+, H 2 +, and O+. B) Finite gyroradius effects are apparent in ambient 0 as the result of its interaction with Titan s atmosphere. <b>C)</b> The principal <b>pickup</b> ions are composed of H+, H 2 +, CH 4 + and N 2 +. D) There is clear evidence of slowing down of the ambient plasma due to pickup ion mass loading; and, as the ionopause~ is approached, heavier pickup ions such as N 2 + become dominant. The similarities and differences between the magnitudes and structures of the electron densities and temperatures along the three flyby trajectories are describe...|$|R
