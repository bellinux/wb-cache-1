Analyzing a data set of 560 credit files of Thai commercial banks, we find that both the incidence and degree of collateralization are higher there than in developed markets. Thai banks use collateral primarily to reduce the higher credit risks of small and relatively young firms. Long credit relationships do not reduce collateral requirements by lowering information asymmetry. Market imperfections result from housebanks demanding higher collateral than non-housebanks, suggesting a lock-in effect for their borrowers, and from larger banks realizing higher collateral claims.

40|$|Does {{repeated}} {{borrowing from}} the same lender affect loan contract terms? We find that such borrowing translates into a 10 to 17 bps lowering of loan spreads. These results hold using multiple approaches (Propensity Score Matching, Instrumental Variables, and Treatment Effects Model) that control for the endogeneity of relationships. We find that relationships are especially valuable when borrower transparency is low and the moral hazard among lending syndicate members is high. We also provide a demarcation line between relationship and transactional lending. We find that spreads charged for relationship loans and non-relationship loans become indistinguishable if the borrower is in the top 30 % when ranked by asset size. Similar dissipation of relationship benefits occurs if the borrower has public rated debt or {{is part of the}} S&P 500 index.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} further {{insights into}} the nature of relationship lending by analyzing the link between relationship lending, borrower quality and collateral as a key variable in loan contract design. We used a unique data set based on the examination of credit files of five leading German banks, thus relying on information actually used in the process of bank credit decision-making and contract design. In particular, bank internal borrower ratings serve to evaluate borrower quality, and the bank's own assessment of its housebank status serves to identify information-intensive relationships. Additionally, we used data on workout activities for borrowers facing financial distress. We found no significant correlation between ex ante borrower quality and the incidence or degree of collateralization. Our results indicate that the use of collateral in loan contract design is mainly driven by aspects of relationship lending and renegotiations. We found that relationship lenders or housebanks do require more collateral from their debtors, thereby increasing the borrower's lock-in and strengthening the banks' bargaining power in future renegotiation situations. This result is strongly supported by our analysis of the correlation between ex post risk, <b>collateral</b> and <b>relationship</b> lending since housebanks do more frequently engage in workout activities for distressed borrowers, and collateralization increases workout probability...|$|R

40|$|Autonomy {{is a prime}} {{issue on}} {{robotics}} field and it {{is closely related to}} decision making. Last researches on decision making for social robots are focused on biologically inspired mechanisms for taking decisions. Following this approach, we propose a motivational system for decision making, using internal (drives) and external stimuli for learning to choose the right action. Actions are selected from a finite set of skills in order to keep robot's needs within an acceptable range. The robot uses reinforcement learning in order to calculate the suitability of every action in each state. The state of the robot is determined by the dominant motivation and its relation to the objects presents in its environment. The used reinforcement learning method exploits a new algorithm called Object Q-Learning. The proposed reduction of the state space and the new algorithm considering the <b>collateral</b> effects (<b>relationship</b> between different objects) results in a suitable algorithm to be applied to robots living in real environments. In this paper, a first implementation of the decision making system and the learning process is implemented on a social robot showing an improvement in robot's performance.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of fairy tales often involves complex interactions between oral and literary traditions, {{which can be}} difficult to tease apart when investigating their origins. Here, we show how computer-assisted stemmatology can be productively applied to this problem, focusing on a long-standing controversy in fairy tale scholarship: did Little Red Riding Hood originate as an oral tale that was adapted by Perrault and the Brothers Grimm, or is the oral tradition in fact derived from literary texts? We address this question by analysing a sample of twenty-four literal and oral versions of the fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood using several methods of phylogenetic analysis, including maximum parsimony and two network-based approaches (NeighbourNet and TRex). While the results of these analyses are more compatible with the oral origins hypothesis than the alternative literary origins hypothesis, their interpretation is problematized by the fact that none of them explicitly model lineal (i. e. ancestor-descendent) relationships among taxa. We therefore present a new likelihood-based method, PhyloDAG, which was specifically developed to model lineal as well as <b>collateral</b> and reticulate <b>relationships.</b> A comparison of different structures derived from PhyloDAG provided a much clearer result than the maximum parsimony, NeighbourNet or TRex analyses, and strongly favoured the hypothesis that literary versions of Little Red Riding Hood were originally based on oral folktales, rather than vice versa...|$|R
40|$|In many {{developing}} countries, pro‐poor entrepreneurship and innovation {{is facing a}} financing gap. Such innovation suffers {{from a lack of}} finance especially from the mainstream (or core) of the financial system. Instead, the little support that exists comes from alternative sources at the periphery of the financial system. This substantial gap in finance for rural PEBI, which remains unexplored, is the focus of this paper. To start, a number of barriers to access to finance are considered, from which a conceptual framework is constructed. The framework considers the financial system as made up of a core (the banks) and a periphery, where the way knowledge flows within the system, the type of knowledge that can be accessed and accumulated, and the kind of relationships that exists matter. It is suggested that at the core, path dependence and institutional lock‐in together with a closed network of similar knowledge types and a dependence on <b>collateral</b> rather than <b>relationships,</b> result in a rigid and a closed system. The periphery organisations are better able to obtain and act on new knowledge (and provide finance) {{for a number of reasons}} which form the basis for a set of insufficient but necessary (INUS) condition.

40|$|Abstract The role of {{relationship}} banking {{has been the}} subject of intensive discussion in recent years. A large body of the literature has examined the benefits and costs related to lender-borrower relationships in small business finance. Despite the numerous studies conducted in both market-based and bank-based economies, the specific sources of the determinants of the value {{of relationship}} lending are ambiguous. However, many research results imply that a close and long-term relationship with the bank is desirable for small businesses. In this study, we investigate the sources of value in Finnish lender-borrower relationships in small business finance. We conduct three separate empirical studies that cover the following aspects of relationship banking: determinants of the value of the bank-firm <b>relationship,</b> <b>collateral</b> requirements and borrower risk, and the comparison of the different characteristics of relationship banking in bank financing and non-bank financing. We use unique and detailed credit file data from two sources, bank data from one of the largest banks in Finland and non-bank data from a large financial institution owned by the Finnish state. Both datasets cover the period 1995 to 2001. Our main findings are the following. First, duration and scope are important characteristics in determining the sources of value in the bank-firm relationship. We find that a longer relationship tends to lower the cost of the credit, and that wider scope tends to decrease the collateral requirements significantly. Second, a long-lasting bank-firm relationship is beneficial, especially to high-risk firms. As the relationship matures, loan premiums for high-risk firms decrease at a higher rate than for low-risk firms. Third, low-risk borrowers put up more collateral than high-risk borrowers, which implies the existence of a signaling effect. According to the signaling theory, low-risk firms are willing to pledge more collateral than high-risk firms. Fourth, when comparing bank and non-bank credit files, we find that bank-firm characteristics are not fully transferable to the relationship between a non-bank and a firm...|$|R
