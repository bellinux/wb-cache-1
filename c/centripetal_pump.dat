50|$|The chamber bowl {{centrifuge}} has maximum solids {{holding capacity}} of 0.064m^3 and {{is commonly used}} to clarifying fruit juice and beer. This separation processes usually incorporate <b>centripetal</b> <b>pump</b> at effluent discharge point to minimise foaming and contact with air.|$|E
50|$|In {{a nozzle}} disc bowl, {{centrate}} (solid output) or effluent liquid can be discharged by <b>centripetal</b> <b>pump</b> or paring pump. This is advantageous {{in reducing the}} energy of the discharge stream, allows air contact as well as reduces foaming especially when liquid has dissolved protein.|$|E
40|$|Rotor of a {{water pumping}} {{windmill}} converts energy from the wind into shaft power. Hence rotor of a wind machine plays {{a very important role}} in wind pump application. For a given application of the wind machine,the aerodynamic design of rotor involves optimising the rotor and its components to produce maximum power co-efficient, which is the ratio of the actual rotor output to the energy available in the wind for a given rotor area. An effort has been made in this design exercise to optimise the rotor {{of a water}} pumping windmill for salt farming application from shallow wells (suction head less than 8 mt.) at Tuticorin, in Tamil Nadu,a moderate to strong windy coastal region, using a <b>centripetal</b> <b>pump</b> as the load...|$|E
5000|$|The {{suction process}} of the {{separator}} takes place as stationary feed pipe suctions the mixture liquid into the cone-shaped pipe that feeds into the vortex. After the filtration of the liquids occur the unwanted contaminants are discharged either through an overflow or through one or two <b>centripetal</b> <b>pumps.</b>|$|R
40|$|Centrifugal {{microfluidic}} systems bear {{great potential}} for applications where ruggedness, portability, ease-of-use, and cost efficiency are critical. However, due to the unidirectional nature of the centrifugal pumping force, the number of sequential process steps which can be integrated on these “Lab-on-a-Disc” (LoaD) devices is limited by their finite radial extension. To significantly widen this bottleneck and thus expand the scope of applications that can be ported on these LoaD platforms, various groups have developed a range of <b>centripetal</b> <b>pumping</b> mechanisms. Here, we present two advancements over our previous efforts in this area by combining buoyancy-based pumping with dissolvable film (DF) valves. First, we present a buoyancy-driven, reciprocating flow of a dense liquid initially located an upper reservoir and a sample in a peripheral reservoir. Secondly, we combine buoyancy-driven <b>centripetal</b> <b>pumping</b> with sample discretization and metering to fully integrate and automate a liquid handling protocol towards implementing a multi-parameter bioassay on a disc...|$|R
50|$|These {{are also}} {{referred}} to as All fluid pumps. The fluid is pushed outward or inward and move fluid axially. They operate at much lower pressures and higher flow rates than radial-flow (<b>centripetal)</b> <b>pumps.</b> Axial-flow pumps cannot be run up to speed without special precaution. If at a low flow rate, the total head rise and high torque associated with this pipe would mean that the starting torque would have to become a function of acceleration for the whole mass of liquid in the pipe system. If there is a large amount of fluid in the system, accelerate the pump slowly.|$|R
40|$|Part I:	A <b>centripetal</b> <b>pump</b> {{consists}} of a self-aligning rotor in rotation close to a fixed plane stator. In such an apparatus Reiner observed an excess air pressure in {{the gap between the}} discs over ambient and a consequent repulsive force between the discs. Reiner interpreted this repulsive force {{to be the result of}} non-Newtonian properties of air. Since this hypothesis is in contradiction with known behavior of air in other similar situations, we try to explain it as due to imperfections of the apparatus used and consider three possibilities: dynamic unbalance of the rotor, instability of the rotor and vibrations of the stator. The results of the analyses show that the third possibility can explain Reiner's observations under some reasonable assumptions. It is concluded that Reiner's hypothesis is unjustified. Part II: A model for inhomogeneous turbulence, due to Saffman, describes turbulence in terms of two scalar densities governed by nonlinear diffusion equations. Using this model some turbulent flows are studied to assess the value of the model as a basis for analyzing turbulent flows. The specific problems studied include the two-dimensional wake, the two-dimensional jet, the turbulent couette flow, flow in a channel and the turbulent trailing vortex. Predictions based on the model agree fairly well with experimental results except for the turbulent trailing vortex. Some shortcomings of the model as evident from the application are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Centrifugal {{microfluidics}} {{has emerged}} as a unique approach to the development of integrated total analysis systems for medical diagnostics. However, despite its many advantages, the platform has a size limitation due to the <b>centripetal</b> <b>pumping</b> mechanism in which fluids can only be moved {{from the center of the}} disc to the rim. This limits the footprint of the microfluidic network to one radius of the disc, and this in turn limits the amount of space available to embed complex assays. In order to overcome this space limitation problem, we are developing new techniques to pump fluids back toward the center of the disc as to allow greater path lengths for the fluidic network. This study presents a novel pumping mechanism for centrifugal microfluidics utilizing a combination of centrifugation and pneumatic compression. Pneumatic energy is stored during high-speed centrifugation with sample fluids trapping then compressing air in specially designed chambers. The accumulated pneumatic energy is released by spinning down, which expands the trapped air and thus pumps liquids back toward the center of the CD. This newly developed method overcomes current limitations of <b>centripetal</b> <b>pumping</b> avoiding external manipulation or surface treatments. In this article, we explore the design of appropriate chambers to induce pneumatic pumping and analytically describe the mechanics behind the pumping action. For proof of principle, we have applied pneumatic pumping to siphon priming...|$|R
50|$|Both conical plate {{centrifuge}} and tubular bowl centrifuge can be {{used for}} liquid/liquid and solid/liquid separation. However, the advantage of conical plate centrifuge over tubular bowl centrifuge is that solid discharge is possible in conical plate but recovery of solids in tubular bowl is difficult and there is limited solid capacity. As the liquid discharge in conical plate centrifuge is under high pressure, this eliminates foaming but foaming is present in tubular bowl centrifuges unless special skimming or <b>centripetal</b> <b>pumps</b> are used. Tubular bowl centrifuges are easier to clean and good sludge dewatering as compared to conical plate centrifuge.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} method of buoyancy-driven <b>centripetal</b> <b>pumping</b> {{utilizing}} a heavy, water-immiscible liquid to displace an aqueous sample radially inwards against the prevailing centrifugal force. Using formerly introduced dissolvable-film valving, we demonstrate metering and bidirectional periodical pumping of a single sample in the radial direction. We then show integrated sample discretisation, meter-ing and buoyancy-driven inward pumping in a microfluidic structure designed towards multi-parameter bioassays. This structure permits centrifugation of sample {{on the periphery of}} a disc (where the centrifugal field p) and proves a high degree of metering accuracy better than 1. 2...|$|R
