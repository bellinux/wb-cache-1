In the town of Osijek there were more parties and coalitions {{in the beginning of the}} 20 th century, and People 2 ̆ 7 s party (Narodna stranka) was in power in Osijek and the county of Virovitica. Osijek was multinational and multi-confessional town and center of Slavonia, and it was a center of many antagonisms of economical and political interests which were specifically expressed through the elections. In Osijek there was Croatian - Serbian coalition and there was agreed Osijek Resolution, before the Resolution of Rijeka was brought, and apart from the People 2 ̆ 7 s party, great influence {{in the town}} of Osijek had Starčević 2 ̆ 7 s party of Law (Stranka prava) and <b>Croatian</b> <b>Farmers</b> <b>party</b> (Hrvatska seljacka stranka). For the representatives in Croatian - Slavonian - Dalmatian parliament the results of elections in Osijek brought many changes, because in stead of former two representatives People 2 ̆ 7 s (Hungarian) party, Croatian parliament was entered by one independent representative supported by the opposition (coalition) and one representative supported by the People 2 ̆ 7 s party, who later became the dissident of the same party. Since the elections in 1906, the town of Osijek shared the destiny of the rest of Croatia and Slavonia, where the opposition (coalition) came to power, while the People 2 ̆ 7 s party weakened, which for Osijek will mark the beginning of the end of Hungarian "People 2 ̆ 7 s" policy...|$|E

5000|$|The 1930s have in {{the post-war}} era {{been seen as a}} {{controversial}} time in the party's history. This is partly because of Vidkun Quisling, who later became the leader of Nasjonal Samling, was Minister of Defence in the <b>Farmers</b> <b>Party</b> Kolstad and Hundseid cabinets from 1931-1933. Quisling was however {{not a member of the}} <b>Farmers</b> <b>Party.</b> While there were fascist sympaties among parts of the <b>Farmers</b> <b>Party's</b> electorate, the <b>Farmers</b> <b>Party</b> itself never supported fascism. It was after all the <b>Farmers</b> <b>Party</b> that enabled the first stable Labour cabinet in Norway. In 1935, they reached a compromise with the Labour Party, which led to the Nygaardsvold Cabinet. In addition, the <b>Farmers</b> <b>Party</b> was represented in the war-time cabinet by Anders Fjeldstad, who served as a consultative councillor of state. Political scientist Trond Nordby in 2009 also said that the Farmers' Party has been given an undeservably bad reputation from this time, and that the party was not really [...] "as dark brown as some claim".|$|R

40|$|Although income parity {{has been}} {{achieved}} in Dutch agriculture, dissatisfaction with income is prevalent among farmers for reasons which are quite understandable. Low income {{is the most important}} factor that brings about the {{decrease in the number of}} farmers. A real opposition against government agricultural policies is pursued by two minor political parties, namely the Communist <b>Party</b> and the <b>Farmers</b> <b>Party.</b> The <b>Farmers</b> <b>Party</b> is a radical right wing political party which has enjoyed a fast growing electoral success between 1958 and 1966. Farmers who sympathise with the <b>Farmers</b> <b>Party</b> are over-represented among those farmers who look for security to be given by the government. The central hypothesis of the empirical study was that those farmers who score high on the authoritarianism scale, and who at the same time are disoriented in some way, will show sympathies with the <b>Farmers</b> <b>Party.</b> Two kinds of disorientation are further elaborated: anomy and relative deprivation. This central hypothesis is invalidated by empirical data. Anomy, independent from authoritarianism, appears to be a factor explaining sympathies with the Farmers Party; second, only among the less authoritarian farmers and, connected with this, among the higher income categories can a relationship be observed between relative deprivation and sympathy with the <b>Farmers</b> <b>Party.</b> Disorientation is presumably the central factor that brings about a sympathy with the <b>Farmers</b> <b>Party.</b> Among the higher income categories, anomy seems to originate from income dissatisfaction; among the lower income categories, those farmers who look for security to be given by the government and who at the same time do not believe that the government will be ready to procure this security, show sympathies with the Farmers Part...|$|R
