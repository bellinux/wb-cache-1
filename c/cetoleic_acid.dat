40|$|Background: Dietary {{guidelines}} generally recommend increasing fish {{intake and}} reducing red meat intake for better long-term health. Few studies have compared the metabolic differences between eating meat and fish. Objective: The {{objective of this}} study was to determine whether there are differences in the postprandial plasma metabolic response to meals containing baked beef, baked herring, and pickled herring. Methods: Seventeen overweight men (BMI 25 - 30 kg/m(2), 41 - 67 y of age) were included in a randomized crossover intervention study. Subjects ate baked herring, pickled herring, and baked beef based meals in a randomized order and postprandial blood plasma samples were taken over 7 h. Plasma metabolomics were measured with the use of gas chromatography mass spectrometry and areas under the curve for detected metabolites were compared between meals. Results: The plasma postprandial response of 2 -aminoadipic acid, a suggested marker of diabetes risk, was 1. 6 times higher after the beef meal than after the baked herring meal (P < 0. 001). Plasma p-alanine and 4 -hydroxyproline both were markedly greater after beef intake than after herring intake (16 and 3. 4 times the response of baked herring, respectively; P < 0. 001). Herring intake led to a greater plasma postprandial response from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and <b>cetoleic</b> <b>acid</b> compared with beef (17. 6 and 150 times greater, respectively; P < 0. 001), whereas hippuric acid and benzoic acid were elevated after pickled herring compared with baked herring (5. 4 and 43 times higher; P < 0. 001). Conclusions: These results in overweight men confirm that DHA and <b>cetoleic</b> <b>acid</b> reflect herring intake, whereas p-alanine and 4 -hydroxyproline are potential biomarkers for beef intake. The greater postprandial rise in 2 -aminoadipic acid after the beef meal, coupled to its proposed role in stimulating insulin secretion, may have importance in the context of red meat intake and increased diabetes risk...|$|E
40|$|In the 1960 s to 1980 s, feeding {{experiments}} in rodents, pigs, and nonhuman primates suggested that consumption of erucic acid (22 : 1 n 9) and <b>cetoleic</b> <b>acid</b> (22 : 1 n 11) caused cardiac steatosis. 1 – 4 Although potential effects in humans were never studied, mechanistic {{studies suggest that}} exposure to long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids (LCMUFAs; 20 : 1, 22 : 1, and 24 : 1 fatty acids) might impair myocardium. The heart preferentially uses fatty acids as fuel. 5 – 7 Long-chain fatty acids, including LCMUFAs, are predominantly oxidized in peroxisomes rather than mitochondria, which lack membrane-transporting enzymes for long-chain fatty acids. 3, 8 Peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation produces reactive oxygen species and various cytosolic lipid metabolites 8 that stimulate several signaling pathways, thereby inhibiting mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, synthesizing cardiac lipid droplets, inhibiting glycolysis, and inducing apoptosis. 5 – 7 In sum, suc...|$|E
40|$|Cynomolgi (Macaca fascicularis) {{were fed}} diets {{containing}} 25 % rapeseed oil (RSO), partially hydrogenated herring oil (PHHO), or a 3 : 1 mixture of lard and corn oil as control for 4 months. The RSO contained approximately 25 % of the fatty acids as erucic acid; the PHHO contained a similar concentration of mainly <b>cetoleic</b> <b>acid.</b> The control diet {{did not include}} such fatty acids. At the time of necropsy, the RSO- and PHHO-fed monkeys showed myocardial and skeletal muscle lipidosis. Foci of mononuclear cell infiltration, although infrequent, occurred in all three groups and {{were thought to be}} nonspecific. The only significant intergroup difference in serum biochemical or hematologic parameters was an increase in serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase activity in both RSO and PHHO groups. Ultrastructural studies confirmed the presence of lipidosis in cardiac and skeletal muscle and revealed mild mitochondrial degeneration, causing a depression of the P/O ratio of the RSO group and a State III respiratory rate depression of the PHHO group. The difference in the exposure/life span ratio represented by this experiment may account for the absence of clear intergroup differences such as are reported in rats used in similar studies, but a true species difference in regard to dietary oils containing docosenoic acids has to be considered as well...|$|E
40|$|NoGas chromatography-mass {{spectrometry}} (GC-MS) and bulk carbon isotope determinations {{have been}} performed on samples (`cemented organic residues', charcoal, sediment and fire-cracked rock) excavated from twelve slab-lined pits from various locations in Arctic Norway to test the premise that these archaeological features {{were used for the}} extraction of oil from the blubber of marine mammals, such as seal, whale and walrus. A wide range of lipid compound classes were detected especially in the cemented organic residues and in the charcoal samples. The presence of long-chain unsaturated and isoprenoid fatty acids together with oxidation and thermal alteration products of unsaturated acids such as dicarboxylic acids, dihydroxyfatty acids and ¿-(o-alkylphenyl) alkanoic acids suggests that these features were used for marine oil extraction at elevated temperatures. Notably the location of the hydroxyl groups in the dihydroxyfatty acids provides a record of the positional isomer of the precursor fatty acid and allows confirmation that 11 -docosenoic (<b>cetoleic)</b> <b>acid,</b> the most abundant C 22 : 1 isomer in marine oil, was a major component of the original lipid. Further information was provided by the presence of long-chain fatty acyl moieties in surviving triacylglycerols and the presence of cholesterol. A fungal metabolite, mycose (trehalose), was found in all samples apart from a fire-cracked rock and points to microbiological activity in the pits. Bulk isotope analysis conducted on the `cemented organic residues¿ is consistent with modern reference samples of blubber and oil from seal and whale. These data provide clear analytical evidence of the function of slab-lined pits in the archaeological record and suggest widespread exploitation of marine mammals for producing oil for heating, lighting and myriad other uses in the past...|$|E
40|$|In the pelagic system, {{phytoplankton}} are {{the main}} producers of n- 3 LC-PUFA and make up {{the foundation of the}} oceanic food web. Zooplankton, such as copepods and krill, are the most numerous primary consumers in the marine environment and have {{a central role in the}} energy transfer to higher trophic levels. The copepod Calanus finmarchicus is present in large amounts in the North Atlantic and has lipid-rich stages that can be harvested in a sustainable manner. The aim of this thesis was to provide knowledge which could contribute to the commercial utilization of Calanus finmarchicus. The wax ester-rich oil may be used as an alternative lipid source to fish oil in feeds for aquaculture, leading to good growth and efficient nutrient utilization. Moreover, the oil can be used as a health promoting nutraceutical as several recent publications indicate that oil from C. finmarchicus may have beneficial health effects beyond those which may be ascribed to the intake of EPA and DHA alone. In this work it was investigated if the use of commercial proteolytic enzymes could improve oil recovery from C. finmarchicus in an industrial-like process, and to characterize the oil obtained. The results showed a substantially higher oil yield with the use of proteolytic enzymes compared to standard fish oil production technology. The main components of the oil extracted from C. finmarchicus are monoesters of long-chain fatty acids and fatty alcohols, namely wax esters. In addition, the oil is rich in the deep red antioxidant astaxanthin present mostly as di- and monoesters. The fatty acid moiety of the wax esters consists of high quantities of stearidonic acid (SDA, 18 : 4 n- 3), EPA and DHA, but also a considerable amount of monounsaturated fatty acids, especially gondoic acid (20 : 1 n- 9) and <b>cetoleic</b> <b>acid</b> (22 : 1 n- 11). The final part of the thesis was to study the digestion of wax esters in mice fed a high fat diet supplemented with 2 % Calanus® Oil. The findings confirmed that the mice were able to digest and absorb the Calanus® Oil, as the fatty acid composition of the adipose tissue and liver reflected the enrichment with the marine wax esters. Feeding mice a high fat diet supplemented with a small amount of wax ester-oil reduced the body weight gain, in line with recent published studies...|$|E
