5|$|As railroads {{began to}} become more common, {{attendance}} of the Mountain Grove <b>Campground</b> began to decline. The attendance of the <b>campground</b> dropped severely in 1891. On July 9, 1891, the <b>campground</b> placed an unusually large advertisement in a local newspaper. Attendance continued to drop in 1892. The decline continued, despite efforts by the <b>campground</b> directors {{to increase the number}} of Chautauqua speakers and religious speakers. Attempts were made throughout the 1890s to stave off the impending failure of the <b>campground,</b> but were largely unsuccessful. Later, the Board of Managers decided that they would open the <b>campground</b> specifically for special events, such as the Bloomsburg Methodist Church's plans for an eleven-car special train to carry picnickers and a band there. By the mid-1890s, it was permitted for visitors to bring their own supplies, rent multiple tents, and decide whether to stay for one or two weeks. A short branch line of the Danville, Hazleton, and Wilkes-Barre Railroad was then built to allow easier transport of visitors' baggage to the <b>campground.</b> Baggage carrying was also done for free and the attendance fee was also reduced. Only one of the twenty-five prominent local families who attended the camp meeting in the 1880s still attended it in the 1890s.|$|E

5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the operation of Mountain Grove <b>Campground,</b> the majority of people traveling there were worshipers. In the 1870s and 1880s, the <b>campground</b> was one of the three largest camp meeting sites that residents of Columbia County attended. In 1875, approximately 2500 people attended the camp meeting. In 1881, it was decided that all the profit generated from the <b>campground</b> would be dedicated to expansion and improvement of it.
