40|$|Provita LE is a {{preparation}} of Enterococcus faecium and Lactobacillus rhamnosus authorised {{for use in}} piglets and calves. EFSA was requested to re-evaluate Provita LE when used with <b>calves</b> <b>for</b> <b>rearing</b> up to four months {{in the range of}} 1 × 109 to 5 x 109 CFU/kg feedingstuffs. The identity of both strains has been established and no resistance to clinically relevant antibiotic detected. L. rhamnosus satisfies the requirements for the qualified presumption of safety approach to safety assessment, and is presumed safe for the target animals, consumers and the environment. Safety of the complete additive for the target species at the proposed dose range was demonstrated in a tolerance study in which no adverse effects were seen when a 100 -fold overdose of the additive was administered to calves. The enterococcal strain was shown not to contain marker genes typical of hospital-associated isolates responsible for clinical infections and does not raise additional safety concerns. Since no other sources of concern were identified, Provita LE is considered safe for consumers. No data on skin/respiratory sensitisation were provided. In the absence of data, the potential of the additive to be a skin/respiratory sensitiser cannot be excluded. The dustiness of the additive tested indicated a potential for users to be exposed via inhalation. Given the proteinaceous nature of the active agents, the additive should be considered to have {{the potential to be a}} skin/respiratory sensitiser and treated accordingly. E. faecium is a natural component of the gut microbiota and its use as Provita LE in animal feeding is not expected to pose any risk to the environment. The data from three trials presented showed that Provita LE has the potential to improve the zootechnical performance of <b>calves</b> <b>for</b> <b>rearing</b> at 1 × 109 CFU/kg milk replacer or complementary feed...|$|E
40|$|Cylactin® {{consists}} of dehydrated cells of {{a strain of}} Enterococcus faecium. It is authorised for use in feeds for chickens, turkeys and pigs for fattening, piglets, sows, calves and cats and dogs. The applicant is now seeking re-evaluation when used with calves and a new authorisation for use in feed for goat kids and lambs for rearing and for fattening at 1. 0 x 109 - 6. 6 x 109 CFU/kg feed. The strain does not contain marker genes typical of hospital-associated isolates responsible for clinical infections and is susceptible to clinically relevant antibiotics, except for kanamycin which is considered of no concern. There were no adverse effects seen in calves when Cylactin® was administered at a 100 -fold overdose. Consequently, Cylactin® is considered safe for calves for fattening and for rearing at the recommended dose. This conclusion was extended to kids for fattening and rearing. However, lambs for fattening are not considered a minor species and require a separate demonstration of safety which was not provided. No additional concerns would arise for consumers, users and the environment from the proposed extension of use. Seven trials made with calves for fattening or rearing were considered. Use of the additive with calves for fattening significantly increased final body weight and/or daily gain in four of five trials when used at a dose of 1 x 109 CFU/kg complete feed. An additional study with <b>calves</b> <b>for</b> <b>rearing</b> confirmed these results at the same dose. As the mechanism of action of the additive can be reasonably assumed to be same, the positive results seen in calves for fattening and rearing can be extrapolated to kids for rearing and fattening. Conclusions on {{the efficacy of the}} product for sheep would derive from results with lambs for fattening which were not made available...|$|E
50|$|Purebred female calves {{of dairy}} cows are reared as {{replacement}} dairy cows. Most purebred dairy calves {{are produced by}} artificial insemination (AI). By this method each bull can serve very many cows, so only a {{very few of the}} purebred dairy male calves are needed to provide bulls for breeding. The remainder of the male <b>calves</b> may be <b>reared</b> <b>for</b> beef or veal; however, some extreme dairy breeds carry so little muscle that rearing the purebred male calves may be uneconomic, and in this case they are often killed soon after birth and disposed of. Only a proportion of purebred heifers are needed to provide replacement cows, so often some of the cows in dairy herds are put to a beef bull to produce crossbred <b>calves</b> suitable <b>for</b> <b>rearing</b> as beef.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the impact of selected indicators in suckler cows breeds, their model quantification and comparison of optimal (recommended) parameters with achieved real natural-economic results in the monitored file of farms (n= 5) in 2009. The average annual total costs in the monitored farms in 2009 were € 769 (2. 1 €. FD- 1) per a suckler cow and the average total costs <b>for</b> <b>rearing</b> of heifer till to calving at € 1, 362 per heifer. At the model natality of 65 calves, we estimated the total revenues <b>for</b> <b>calves</b> 1000 (calves with the average daily weight gain 1, 000 g. pc - 1) at about € 29, 700 and <b>for</b> <b>calves</b> 781 (calves with the average daily weight gain 781 g. pc - 1) € 24, 024 (€ - 5, 676). For maximum model natality of 95 calves have been estimated revenues <b>for</b> <b>calves</b> 1000 at about € 49, 500 and <b>for</b> <b>calves</b> 781 € 40, 039 (€ - 9, 461). When the actually achieved natality in monitored farms is at average 78. 98 % (80 %), we can estimate the average revenues <b>for</b> 60 realized <b>calves</b> 1000 at € 39, 600 and by the calves 781 at € 32, 031 (€ - 7, 569). Economic loss due to shortening the length of <b>calves</b> <b>rearing</b> <b>for</b> a month represents a decrease of potential revenues per a calf on average € 72 respectively € 56 (€ - 16) per month reducing the length of <b>calves</b> <b>rearing.</b> <b>For</b> really achieved average daily weight gain of calves 781 g. pc- 1, we can estimate the potential revenues per a weaned calf at € 534 respectively for average daily weight gain 1, 300 g. pc- 1, revenues approximately € 833 (€ - 299). In terms of length of cow productive age, we estimated that if we reject cow after the third lactation, depreciation will be at € 246 per year (0. 67 €. FD- 1) respectively after eleven lactation at € 67 (0. 18 €. FD- 1) per year...|$|R

40|$|Forty-six Holstein heifer calves {{were used}} {{from birth to}} 3 rno to study the effect of {{supplemental}} vitamin E at 1400 or 2800 mg dl-a. -tocopherol acetate given orally at weekly intervals or 1400 mg dl-a-tocopherol by intramuscular injection. Weekly starter consumption was 10 to 27 % more (P=. 12) and weekly weight gains were 9 to 25 % more (P=. 13) in supplemented calves. Creatine phosphokinase activity was negatively correlated with serurn tocopherol concentrations, indicating a subclinical muscular dystrophy in unsupplemented calves. Lymphocyte stimulation indices were positively correlated with serum tocopherol concentration. Calves given high level of oral supplementation had higher IgM antibody concentration.

40|$|Forty {{crossbred}} calves (Holstein and Brawn Swiss xZebu) {{of approximately}} {{three to four}} months of age {{at the start of the}} trial were used. A]: 1 received molasses/urea plus residual milk after each milking and grazed from eight in the morning to three in the afternoon. The two treatments were 600 g/day of rice polishings or 2. 5 % liveweight of leucaena forage. No significant differences in the liveweight gains between the two treatments were observed nor were symptoms of toxicity. Therefore it is concluded chat leucaena at 2 % of liveweight could provide a good supplement <b>for</b> <b>calves</b> <b>reared</b> in restricted suckling systems after grazing. Key words: Restricted suckling, calf rearing, leucaena In milk production systems in the tropical regions of Mexico, Zebu and Zebu crosses using larger breeds such as Brown Swiss and Holstein are generally used in dual-purpose systems.

40|$|Cattle exhibit {{behavioral}} laterality, but {{the consistency}} and correlation between behaviors are unknown. Behavioral laterality {{was recorded in}} two herds of contrasting management intensity. The first was a small, extensively managed herd in Brazil, with cows and calves on rangeland, except when removed for hand-milking in stalls. The second was a large, intensive British herd, with cows fed mostly indoors and <b>calves</b> removed <b>for</b> individual <b>rearing</b> soon after birth. In herd 1, {{the side of the}} body on which the following behaviors were performed was recorded: rumination (rumination), tail waving (tail), tongue protrusion during the initiation of a feeding bout (feeding), hind leg placement when lying (lying), and front leg initiating walking (walking). The distribution of left and right side dominance was normal for all behaviors, with positive correlations between walking and rumination, tail, and feeding, and between lying and rumination. In herd 2, rumination, feeding, and lying behaviors were similarly recorded, as well as parlor side-preference (parlor) and the side of a track chosen when returning to pasture (track). For all behaviors except track, the extent of left- and right-side dominance was not normally distributed, and more cows than expected showed strong laterality on the right or the left side. Parlor and track lateralities were correlated, indicating that cows that entered one side of the parlor also tended to choose {{the same side of the}} track. Strong laterality in the intensively managed herd therefore contrasted with that observed in the extensively managed herd and the reasons for such differences in laterality are uncertain...|$|R
40|$|The {{study has}} been aimed at {{identify}} risk factors {{that may be used}} in welfare assessment of calves reared in intensive farming systems. These factors may be useful to the farmers in planning breeder measures in order to increase the animal welfare levels in relation to the legislative requirements. The estimation considered the housing conditions of calves aged 0 - 6 months grouped in two lots A (n: 50) and B (n: 60), depending on their accommodation system. We have monitored the calves decubitus on the housing surface, body hygiene {{as well as that of}} the resting area and the thermal comfort. The assessment was made by direct observation and numerical estimation, based on the Welfare Quality ® 2009 protocol (Assessment protocol for cattle) as well as by means of a calves safety and welfare evaluation chart according to the European and national legislation on minimum calves safety and protection standards. Data collected and processed have shown the fact that not all housing conditions completely answer calves physiological requirements. Thus the appropriate housing criterion in the present study was met at B lot of 85 % and to a much smaller degree by the A lot (76 %). The assessment carried out by means of the safety chart have indicated that only the minimum criteria <b>for</b> <b>calves</b> <b>rearing</b> were met, which does not translate into a high level of their welfare. </span...|$|R
