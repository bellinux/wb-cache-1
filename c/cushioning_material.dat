50|$|The {{amount of}} shock {{transmitted}} {{by a particular}} <b>cushioning</b> <b>material</b> is largely dependent on {{the thickness of the}} cushion, the drop height, and the load-bearing area of the cushion (static loading). A cushion must deform under shock for it to function. If a product is on a large load-bearing area, the cushion may not deform and will not cushion the shock. If the load-bearing area is too small, the product may “bottom out” during a shock; the shock is not cushioned. Engineers use “cushion curves” to choose the best thickness and load-bearing area for a <b>cushioning</b> <b>material.</b> Often two to three inches (50 - 75 mm) of cushioning are needed to protect fragile items.|$|E

This is an {{open access}} article {{distributed}} under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. Abstract Wooden pallets are commonly dropped vertically and hit horizontally during distribution. To reduce the impact, it seems logical to place <b>cushioning</b> <b>materials</b> on a pallet. In this study an anti-vibration pad was used in free-fall vertical drop tests and horizontal impact tests of softwood pallets. Results indicate that placing <b>cushioning</b> <b>materials</b> on a pallet does in fact increase impact acceleration significantly due to the uneven surface of the top board of the pallet in the free-fall drop case and due to the additional friction force from the <b>cushioning</b> <b>materials</b> in the horizontal impact case. Thus, placing <b>cushioning</b> <b>materials</b> on wooden pallets is not recommended...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. To {{evaluate}} quantitatively {{the performance}} of <b>cushioning</b> <b>materials,</b> a <b>cushion</b> curve is indispensable. However, the desired cushioning effect may sometimes be absent when we use the cushion curve to design a transport package. In addition, to plot the cushion curve, massive dynamic compression tests are traditionally necessary. Thus, large amounts of labor and material resources are required. Therefore, we used expanded polyethylene and laminated-board <b>cushion</b> as test <b>materials</b> to represent typical <b>cushioning</b> <b>materials,</b> and proposed simplified performance evaluation methods based on certain dynamic compression tests. An analysis of the experimental results showed that to obtain a more accurate packaging design, the shearing effect {{must be taken into}} account when using the cushion curve; For both plastic and paper cushions, new proposed performance evaluation methods significantly reduce the number of dynamic compression tests needed to accurately evaluate an actual packaging design...|$|R

50|$|Construction {{of the pit}} {{can vary}} {{according}} to what materials are available but commonly used are; grass, soil, wood, lime, sawdust and ash. Grass is typically used to line the {{bottom and sides of}} the pit in order to insulate against temperature change and absorb moisture. Before usage, grass should be flamed in order to destroy any pests that may be hiding within. Soil is used to seal the roof of the pit and as filler. Wood and plant material can be used to strengthen walls as well as create a roof covering the pit. Roofs built over the pit structure are beneficial in that they can help keep rain out and provide shade to lower temperature. Lime may have some effectiveness in absorbing CO2 and removing it form the environment. Sawdust is used as a <b>cushioning</b> <b>material</b> and to help control condensation on the tubers.

This research study investigated the use of novel energy absorbing <b>cushion</b> <b>materials</b> integrated into helicopter seats to mitigate the aircrew whole-body exposure to high vibration levels. Replacing the <b>cushion</b> <b>material</b> on a helicopter seat was a low cost solution with less certification effort that provided a reduction in the vibration transmitted to the aircrew. Novel energy absorbing <b>cushion</b> <b>material,</b> namely, the Hybrid Air Cushioning System known as Mitigator and a viscoelastic polyurethane material known as Sorbothane, were evaluated using flight tests on the NRC Bell- 412 helicopter. The test results confirmed that the aircrew vibration levels can be effectively reduced through proper optimization of the seat cushion impedance properties. In particular, integration of the Hybrid Air Cushioning System into the seat significantly reduced the 1 /rev peak while marginally reducing the 4 /rev peak that resulted in an overall reduction in the aircrew vibration.

40|$|Abstract: Expansive clays suffer volume change due {{to changes}} in {{moisture}} content which causes heaving, cracking and {{the breakup of the}} road pavement. The main properties of the expansive soil that are to be improved are strength, volume stability and durability. Stabilization of a clayey sub-grade is necessary to improve its volume stability, increase its unconfined compressive strength and its soaked California Bearing Ratio (CBR), in order to improve the overall pavement performance. The use of industrial by-products for stabilizing expansive soils is gaining importance, because of the ecological and economic benefits derived there from. In the present study, expansive soil, stabilized with Ground Granulated Blast furnace Slag (GGBS), with and without lime was used as <b>cushioning</b> <b>material</b> above an expansive clay sub-grade to study its performance in improving the properties of the sub-grade. The investigations show that the GGBS-stabilized expansive soil, with and without lime, as a <b>cushioning</b> <b>material</b> is effective in reducing the heave of the underlying clay bed apart from improving the soaked CBR and increasing the unconfined compressive strength of the soil, GGBS mix system. The studies also indicate that the <b>cushioning</b> <b>material</b> possesses all the properties needed for use as sub-base material. So, the cushion also serves as a sub-base layer in the pavement structure. The use of GGBS-stabilized soil alone, or in combination with lime, has significant effect in improving the properties o...|$|E
30|$|This report {{reviews the}} impact of current {{mattress}} flammability standards, examines factors affecting mattress flammability, and reviews full-scale and bench-scale test methods that are being developed for mattresses. The construction type, geometry, and size of a mattress are major factors in determining the fire threat of a mattress. The soft materials used in the mattress set, including cushioning materials, fire blocking materials, and tickings, act both individually and collectively to affect the fire performance. The performance of fire barrier materials {{designed to protect the}} inner <b>cushioning</b> <b>material</b> from heat and flame is largely dependent on the choice of <b>cushioning</b> <b>material</b> and ticking. When used with an incompatible combination of filling material and ticking, a fire barrier may fail to protect thermal degradation and subsequent burning of filling material.

30|$|Composite or {{laminated}} fabrics offer two advantages. First, they {{eliminate the}} labor involved in sequential upholstering of fabric layers, and second, they prevent exposure of underlying <b>cushioning</b> <b>materials</b> by ‘crack-opening’. When the multi-layered barrier fabric {{is exposed to}} flames, the heat is taken away by the outer coating or layer of the composite fabric, leaving the underlying substrate to which the coating or outer layer is laminated intact and preventing the involvement of underlying <b>cushioning</b> <b>materials</b> in the fire. For example, when a glass fiber fabric coated with polyvinyl chloride is exposed to flames, the polymer does not shrink away from the underlying glass fiber fabric. Instead, it softens and flows into the interstices of the glass fiber fabric. Laminated/coated fabrics eliminate the air space between the layers of barrier fabric and maintain the aesthetics of the exterior fabric while still providing better fire performance ([Schumann & Hartzell 1989]; [Decabromodiphenylether 2005]).|$|R

30|$|Active fire {{barriers}} have a chemical {{effect on the}} fire. Active barrier materials, not only prevent the ignition of interior <b>cushioning</b> <b>material</b> but can extinguish the flames from the ignition source and prevent the outer upholstery from burning. The chemical activity of active {{fire barriers}} can be in condensed phase (enhanced char formation), gas phase (flame suppression, flame quenching and/or intumescence) or both. They can suppress the flames from the ignition source, prevent the outer upholstery from burning, and prevent the ignition of interior <b>cushioning</b> <b>material</b> by forming char barrier. This essentially lowers the temperatures in a fire and reduces the generation of harmful smoke and gases ([Damant 2009]). Active technologies generally use combinations of fibers and/or coatings of fabrics, or PUFs with gas-phase-active FR for flame suppression or quenching. In general, passive technologies are good inhibitors of smoldering combustion, whereas active technologies suppress flaming combustion by altering either decomposition or oxidation reactions ([Wakelyn et al. 2005]).|$|E

30|$|Placed on {{the surface}} or between components, barrier {{materials}} limit the product involvement in a fire by preventing and/or significantly delaying the ignition of a cover fabric and core materials, lowering the heat release rate, reducing the rate of flame spread and/or extinguishing the flames ([Damant 1996]; Schumann & [Hartzell 1989]; [Damant GH. et al. 1994]). Often these barrier materials are placed between the exterior cover fabric and the first layer of the <b>cushioning</b> <b>material</b> in the furnished article.
