5000|$|CAM is {{acknowledged}} as being particularly significant {{in helping to}} [...] "spark interest {{in the work of}} Britain's artists of color". The first CAM conference was held in 1967 in London, and a subsequent conference at the University of Kent in 1969. [...] The work of CAM members was brought to the public eye by the BBC in the Caribbean edition of the magazine programme Full House, produced by John La Rose and transmitted on 3 February 1973, in which the work of writers, musicians and film-makers was presented in a studio setting of visual artists' work brought together by <b>CAM</b> <b>member</b> Althea McNish.|$|E

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} an improved expandable intramedullary nail for the fixation of bone fractures. The nail includes an elongate sleeve having one end adapted to be inserted within the medullary cavity of the bone. The {{one end of}} the sleeve is formed of a predetermined maximum retracted diameter to permit the insertion of the one end within the bone cavity. A plurality of circumferentially spaced, radially expandable elements are carried by the {{one end of the}} sleeve. The elements are radially movable from a first, retracted position wherein the elements define a first diameter to a second, expanded position wherein the elements define a second diameter greater than the predetermined maximum retracted diameter and the first diameter. In accordance with the present invention, when the elements are in the expanded position, the elements provide at least two support points at the second diameter and axially spaced along the sleeve for engagement with the inner wall of the bone cavity. A <b>camming</b> <b>member</b> is carried by the one end of the elongate sleeve for moving the elements from the retracted position to the expanded position. An actuator is located {{at the other end of}} the sleeve and is coupled to operate the <b>camming</b> <b>member</b> for controlling the radial position of the elements...|$|R

40|$|Cell–cell {{recognition}} and patterning of cell contacts have {{a critical role}} in mediating reversible assembly of a variety of transcellular complexes in the nervous system. This study provides evidence for regulation of cell interactions through modulation of ankyrin binding to neurofascin, a member of the L 1 CAM family of nervous system cell adhesion molecules. The phosphorylation state of the conserved FIGQY tyrosine in the cytoplasmic domain of neurofascin regulates ankyrin binding and governs neurofascin-dependent cell aggregation as well as cell sorting when neurofascin is expressed in neuroblastoma cells. These findings suggest a general mechanism for the patterning of cell contact based on external signals that regulate tyrosine phosphorylation of L 1 <b>CAM</b> <b>members</b> and modulate their binding to ankyrin...|$|R

40|$|An artificial, {{manually}} positionable {{elbow joint}} {{for use in}} an upper extremity, above-elbow, prosthetic is described. The prosthesis provides a locking feature that is easily controlled by the wearer.

The elbow joint of {{the present invention comprises}} a turntable, a frame, a forearm, and a locking assembly. The frame generally includes a housing for the locking assembly and two protruding ears. The forearm includes an elongated beam having a cup-shaped cylindrical member at one end and a locking wheel having a plurality of holes along a circular arc on its other end with a central bore for pivotal attachment to the protruding ears of the frame.

40|$|Embryonic {{development}} {{is one of}} the most complex biological phenomena that involves the appropriate expression and synchronized interactions of a plethora of proteins, including cell adhesion molecules (<b>CAMs).</b> Many <b>members</b> of the diverse family of CAMs have been shown to be critically involved in the correct execution of embryonic development. The Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule (EpCAM) is an atypical cell adhesion molecule originally identified as a marker for carcinoma. However, recent insights have revealed that EpCAM participates in not only cell adhesion, but also in proliferation, migration and differentiation of cells. All of these processes are known to be fundamental for morphogenesis. Here, we review the current literature that establishes EpCAM as a protein involved in morphogenesis, starting from the earliest stages of embryogenesis and ending in organogenesis. In addition, we provide directions for further elucidation of the role of EpCAM in embryogenesis...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTransendothelial {{leukocyte}} {{migration is}} a major aspect of the innate immune response. It is essential in repair and regeneration of damaged tissues and is regulated by multiple cell adhesion molecules (<b>CAMs)</b> including <b>members</b> of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily. Activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM/CD 166) is an Ig CAM expressed by activated monocytes and endothelial cells. Hitherto, the functional relevance of ALCAM expression by endothelial cells and activated monocytes remained unknown. In this report, we demonstrate soluble recombinant human ALCAM significantly inhibited the rate of transendothelial migration of monocyte cell lines. Direct involvement of ALCAM in transendothelial migration was evident from the robust inhibition of this process by ALCAM blocking antibodies. However, soluble recombinant ALCAM had no impact on monocyte migration or adhesion to endothelium. Localization of ALCAM specifically at cell–cell junctions in endothelial cells supported its role in transendothelial migration. This study {{is the first to}} localize ALCAM to endothelial cell junctions and demonstrate a functional relevance for co-expression of ALCAM by activated monocytes and endothelial cells...|$|R

Here, OsCam 1 - 1 was isolated by PCR amplifica-tion from the rice genome. The gene contains an ORF of 450 base pairs {{with a single}} intron at the same position found in other plant Cam genes. A promoter region with a TATA box at position- 26 was predicted and fused to a gus reporter gene, and this con-struct was used to produce transgenic rice by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation.

To examine the properties of OsCaM 1 - 1, the encoding cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli. The elec-trophoretic mobility shift when incubated with Ca 2 + indicates that recombinant OsCaM 1 - 1 is a functional Ca 2 +-binding protein.

40|$|Calmodulins (CaMs) are {{the most}} {{ubiquitous}} calcium sensors in eukaryotes. A number of CaM-binding proteins have been identified through classical methods, and many proteins have been predicted to bind CaMs based on their structural homology with known targets. However, multicellular organisms typically contain many CaM-like (CML) proteins, and a global identification of their targets and specificity of interaction is lacking. In an effort to develop a platform for large-scale analysis of proteins in plants we have developed a protein microarray {{and used it to}} study the global analysis of CaM/CML interactions. An Arabidopsis thaliana expression collection containing 1, 133 ORFs was generated and used to produce proteins with an optimized medium-throughput plant-based expression system. Protein microarrays were prepared and screened with several CaMs/CMLs. A large number of previously known and novel CaM/CML targets were identified, including transcription factors, receptor and intracellular protein kinases, F-box proteins, RNA-binding proteins, and proteins of unknown function. Multiple CaM/CML proteins bound many binding partners, but the majority of targets were specific to one or a few CaMs/CMLs indicating that different <b>CaM</b> family <b>members</b> function through different targets. Based on our analyses, the emergent CaM/CML interactome is more extensive than previously predicted. Our results suggest that calcium functions through distinct CaM/CML proteins to regulate a wide range of targets and cellular activities...|$|R
