However, the beneficial effects of <b>compression</b> <b>garments</b> have not been clearly established. We performed {{a review of the literature}} for prospective, randomized, controlled studies, using quantified lower limb compression in order to (1) describe the beneficial effects that have been identified with <b>compression</b> <b>garments,</b> and in which conditions; and (2) investigate whether there is a relation between the pressure applied and the reported effects. The pressure delivered were measured either in laboratory conditions on garments identical to those used in the studies, or derived from publication data. Twenty three original articles were selected for inclusion in this review. The effects of wearing <b>compression</b> <b>garments</b> during exercise are controversial, as most studies failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect on immediate or performance recovery, or on delayed onset of muscle soreness. There was a trend towards a beneficial effect of <b>compression</b> <b>garments</b> worn during recovery, with performance recovery found to be improved in the five studies in which this was investigated, and delayed-onset muscle soreness was reportedly reduced in three of these five studies. There is no apparent relation between the effects of <b>compression</b> <b>garments</b> worn during or after exercise and the pressures applied, since beneficial effects were obtained with both low and high pressures. Wearing <b>compression</b> <b>garments</b> during recovery from exercise seems to be beneficial for performance recovery and delayed-onset muscle soreness, but the factors explaining this efficacy remain to be elucidated...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: <b>Compression</b> <b>garments</b> {{have long}} been shown to promote {{physiological}} benefits both within the medical profession and also within the sporting arena. Team sports such as field-hockey, football and rugby are characterised by high intensity intermittent exercise, also requiring a significant contribution of motor skill performance and cognitive function. To date there is paucity in the research regarding graduated <b>compression</b> <b>garments</b> and their effects on field-hockey skill performance. Method: 14 male field-hockey players (24 ± 4 years), National League North standard, attended on five separate occasions: two familiarisation sessions and three test sessions. During testing sessions participants wore one of three clothing combinations, Control (polo shirt and shorts), Placebo and Graduated <b>compression</b> <b>garments</b> (Skins™). Placebo and Graduated <b>compression</b> <b>garments</b> were worn underneath the control clothing condition and consisted of a long sleeve top, shorts and socks. The order in which clothing conditions were tested was randomized. Testing consisted of 15 minutes rest followed by a 15 minute warm up. Participants then performed a field-hockey skill test, a repeated sprint ability test and an intermittent endurance test. Following the intermittent endurance test the field-hockey skill test and sprint test were repeated. Followed by 20 minutes recovery. Heart rates were monitored constantly throughout the test. Blood lactate, core temperature and subjective whole thermal ratings, clothing sweating sensation, clothing comfort sensations and Ratings of Perceived Exertion (RPE), were monitored after each test component. Results: Field-hockey skill results {{were not significantly different}} between clothing conditions (p = 0. 800 and p = 0. 822 for pre and post intermittent endurance respectively). Repeated sprint ability fatigue times showed no significant difference between clothing conditions pre intermittent endurance test (p = 0. 607). Post intermittent endurance fatigue time was significantly different between control and placebo (p = 0. 005), but not significant between control and graduated <b>compression</b> <b>garments</b> and between placebo and graduated <b>compression</b> <b>garments</b> (p = 0. 073 and p = 0. 753 respectively). Intermittent endurance results were significant (p = 0. 002) between control and graduated <b>compression</b> <b>garments</b> (1699. 92 ± 120. 19 m and 1767. 71 ± 140. 45 m respectively), and between placebo and graduated <b>compression</b> <b>garments</b> (1682 ± 155. 48 m and 1767. 71 ± 140. 45 m respectively). Heart rate, blood lactate and core temperature between clothing conditions were not significant (p = 0. 510; p = 0. 893; p = 0. 502 respectively). Subjective whole thermal sensations were not significant (p = 0. 784). Clothing sweating sensations were significant for graduated <b>compression</b> <b>garments</b> at field-hockey skill test post intermittent endurance (p = 0. 015) compared to control, sprint test post intermittent endurance (p = 0. 001) compared to control, and also during recovery (p = 0. 0014) compared to placebo. Clothing comfort sensations were significantly improved for graduated <b>compression</b> <b>garments</b> (p = 0. 012). RPE scores were not significant (p = 0. 444). Conclusion: Graduated <b>compression</b> <b>garments</b> do not improve field-hockey skill performance and repeated sprint ability either before or after an intermittent endurance test. They do however significantly improve intermittent endurance running, and may help to maintain skill and sprint performance at levels comparable to clothing conditions performing significantly less in an intermittent endurance test. Graduated <b>compression</b> <b>garments</b> also have significant effects on subjective clothing sweating sensations and also clothing comfort sensations...|$|R

50|$|Compression therapies {{are finding}} more use {{as of the}} last ten years. The {{greatest}} issue with KTS syndrome is that the blood flow and/or lymph flow may be impeded, and will pool in the affected area.

Among older children and adults, <b>compression</b> <b>garments</b> {{can be used to}} alleviate almost all of these, and when combined with elevation of the affected area and proper management, can result in a comfortable lifestyle for the patient without any surgery. <b>Compression</b> <b>garments</b> are also used lately after a debulking procedure to maintain the results of the procedure. For early treatment of infants and toddlers with KTS, custom <b>compression</b> <b>garments</b> are impractical because of the rate of growth.

While <b>compression</b> <b>garments</b> or therapy are not appropriate for everyone, they are relatively cheap (compared to surgery), and have few side-effects.
