In particular, we give a linear-time algorithm that finds all occurrences of a pattern of length m in a text of length n in n+d 4 log m+ 2 m (n Γ m) e comparisons. The pattern preprocessing takes linear time and makes at most 2 m comparisons. This algorithm establishes that, in general, searching for a long pattern is easier than searching for a short one.
