For first-category climbs, points were awarded on a scale of 10points for first across the <b>climb,</b> second place earned 8points, third 6, fourth 4, and one point fewer per place down to a single point for seventh. Second-category climbs awarded points on a scale of 7points for first place, second place earned 5points, third 3, and one point fewer per place down to a single point for fifth.

5|$|Starting in Otley, {{the race}} headed east towards Harewood, {{where the women}} would tackle the first {{categorised}} <b>climb</b> of the day – the 1.2km Côte de Harwood averaging 5% in gradient.

The second <b>climb</b> was slightly shorter, at 0.8km, but boasted a steeper average gradient of 8.2%. The race now headed south, to the intermediate sprint point in Scholes. After the sprint point, the route would take the riders south east, to Sherburn-in-Elmet, then south to Knottingley. After passing through Pontefract the route headed south through Wentbridge, South Elmsall and Hooton Pagnell. After skirting round the westerly side of Doncaster the riders would go through the second intermediate sprint point at Warmsworth and would almost immediately tackle the final and shortest classified <b>climb</b> of the day, the 0.5km 6.5% Côte de Conisbrough Castle.
