5|$|Dynamic DNA {{nanotechnology}} {{focuses on}} forming nucleic acid systems with designed dynamic functionalities {{related to their}} overall structures, such as computation and mechanical motion.

5|$|Genuine press cards can be {{obtained}} by people not entitled to them, counterfeit copies of real cards <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made,</b> and plausible-looking cards can be issued by anybody, or made. The reasons and consequences range from the trivial (free drinks) to the catastrophic (access by terrorists to rulers).|$|E

50|$|Oil <b>cans</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> by {{companies}} like Noera Manufacturing Company and Perfection {{in the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries. Around this time, oil cans frequently leaked and contributed to fires. In 1957, aluminium oil <b>cans</b> <b>were</b> introduced, produced {{by companies}} like the American Can Company.|$|R
50|$|Similar {{mentions}} <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>made</b> {{for individual}} soldiers.|$|R
5|$|Grills {{are made}} of several types of metal (often silver, gold or platinum) that are {{sometimes}} inlaid with precious stones; they are generally removable, though some may be permanently attached to the teeth. Gold grills <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> from 10-karat, up to 24-karat gold. The gold can be tinted yellow, white and rose color.|$|E
5|$|Hong Kong's {{transportation}} {{network is}} highly developed. Over 90% of daily travels (11million) are on public transport, the highest such percentage in the world. Payment <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> using the Octopus card, a stored value system {{introduced by the}} MTR (Mass Transit Railway), which is widely accepted on railways, buses and ferries, and accepted like cash at other outlets.|$|E
5|$|In 2011 An FDA panel voted {{unanimously}} to recommend approval of florbetapir, which is currently used in an investigational study. The imaging agent can help to detect Alzheimer's brain plaques, but will require additional clinical research before it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> available commercially.|$|E

5|$|Silicon-germanium alloys {{are rapidly}} {{becoming}} an important semiconductor material for high-speed integrated circuits.

5|$|The {{chlorine}} oxides are well-studied {{in spite of}} their instability (all of them are endothermic compounds). They are important because they are produced when chlorofluorocarbons undergo photolysis in the upper atmosphere and cause the destruction of the ozone layer. None of them <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> from directly reacting the elements.|$|E
5|$|The early {{investigation}} into the size and nature of quasars drove the development of interferometry techniques in the 1950s; the Lovell telescope had an advantage due to its large collecting area, meaning that high sensitivity interferometer measurements <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> relatively quickly using it. As a result, the telescope featured heavily in the discovery of quasars.|$|E
