Then he caught his breath sharply and paled beneath the <b>coaldust</b> as he saw Sergeant Pilbeam standing on the quay, opposite the ship. By his side stood Miss Pilbeam, and both, with a far-away look in their eyes, were smiling vaguely but contentedly at the horizon. The sergeant {{appeared to be the}} first to see the skipper.|$|E

50|$|Many {{people in}} the village {{previously}} worked in the local coal mines. The largest mine in the village, The West Riding Colliery, was owned by Pope and Pearsons. It was here that the first British <b>coaldust</b> experiments took place during 1908 and 1909, conducted by W. E. Garforth, manager of the colliery {{and president of the}} Mining Association of Great Britain. In the early 20th century Garforth's improvement to worker safety helped to develop underground safety and rescue procedures that are today common worldwide. Today people are either employed in neighbouring towns and cities, or on the Wakefield Europort's 'Tuscany Park' industrial estate which has been developed over recent decades.|$|E
50|$|The Courrières mine {{disaster}}, Europes worst mining accident, {{caused the}} death of 1,099 miners in Northern France on 10 March 1906. This disaster was surpassed only by the Benxihu Colliery accident in China on 26 April 1942, which killed 1,549 miners. A <b>coaldust</b> explosion, the cause of which is not known with certainty, devastated a coal mine operated by the Compagnie des mines de houille de Courrières. Victims lived nearby in the villages of Méricourt (404 people killed), Sallaumines (304 killed), Billy-Montigny (114 people killed), and Noyelles-sous-Lens (102 people killed). The mine was 2 km (1 mi) {{to the east of}} Lens, in the Pas-de-Calais département (about 220 km, or 140 miles, north of Paris).|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of economy and industry introducing {{new technologies and}} materials often means the increased threat of occurrenceof factors harmful to humans and environment. Workers employed in foundries as mould pourers are the group of high professional risk. Foundry moulding sands when poured with liquid metal {{are a source of}} the emission of harmful, toxic and carcinogenic (benzene,PAHs) compounds. The paper presents the results of studies on the concentration of chemical compounds emitted in the process of casting aluminiumalloy and brass using moulding sands with the new inorganic binders. The specific values of the exposure indices were compared with thelimit values. This enabled an assessment of the impact of moulding sands on work environment. The obtained results were compared withthe values of contaminants emitted when pouring foundry moulds made from furan sands and bentonite sands with an addition of <b>coaldust.</b> Studies were carried out under the project POIG. 01. 01. 02 - 00 - 015 / 09 "Advanced materials and technologies. ...|$|E
40|$|Indices of {{ventilatory}} {{function and}} pulmonary gas exchange in 32 non-smoking coalminers (mean age 38. 1) {{were compared with}} those of 34 non-smoking steelworkers of similar age. The coalminers had significantly lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) and maximum expiratory flow rates and significantly higher residual volume, but similar vital capacity and indices derived from the single-breath test. Pulmonary diffusing capacity for CO and indices of CO 2 exchange were similar in both groups. Arterial partial pressure of O 2 (PaO 2) was significantly lower and alveolar-arterial O 2 difference was significantly higher in coalminers than in controls, both at rest and during exercise. There was no relation between lung function and radiological signs of simple pneumoconiosis (10 coalminers had pneumoconiosis). The differences in FEV 1 (0. 42 l) and in PaO 2 (10 mm Hg) between the two groups are the same or larger than those usually found between smokers and non-smokers. Exposure to <b>coaldust</b> may result in biologically significant alterations of lung function {{even in the absence of}} pneumoconiosis...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Industrial Physiology)) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2001 Sasol Sinthetic Fuels (SSF) run the world's largest commercially successful, coal bassed, {{synthetic}} fuel production in Secunda, Mpumalanga. The {{products that are}} produced bu SSF, consist out of liquid fuel, pipeline gas, and large varieties of chemical- and polymeer products. With the processing of fuels, a lot of chemicals are being used at the different plants. At each plant a lot of chemicals are added or deducted from the process. Gaseous releases are released during the coal liquefying process at outlet processes, by-product recovering, dumping, waste handling, carbonated gas removal, sulphate recovering, and power generating. Because the exposure to chemical substances may have harmful effects on the human body, {{it is necessary to}} try to control exposure. To find out to which extend the female workers at SASOL have been exposed to chemical substances in the environment, personal exposure reports were used. The reports were collected from the Occupational Hygiene Department at SASOL and analysed. The personal exposure concentrations to the different substances were compared with the Time Limit Values (TLV), as established by the ACGIH. The personal exposure concentrations are compared to the reproduction guideline values, which indicate reproduction toxicity, as well. Values higher than the established values, can be indicative of reproduction toxicity (Jankovic & Drake, 1996 : 54) A floor plan of SASOL was used to establish the area from which women were chosen to participate in the study. The middle area of SASOL was identified from where the experimental group came from for the study. The middle area was chosen, because this is the area where most of the women are localised. All the women in this chosen area were used for the study. A questionnaire was compiled with the help of Dr. W. Van Wyk, Dr. W. P. Labuschagne and Mr. P. J. Laubscher. The type of questions that were asked in the questionnaire, were about abnormalities gynaecologists experienced in Secunda and abnormalities that were described in the literature. Because a whole population of female workers were studied, the study made use of practical significance. Statistic significance was only used to compare the different groups of women that were used for the study. The program that was used for statistical processing of the data was the SAS system for Windows Release 6. 12, 1996. One-way and two-way tables were composed. The one-way tables indicate the frequency of the different types of questions that are asked and the two-way tables compare the answers of the questions with one another. The tables and graphs were done with the EXCELL-Program. Results that came forward from out the study are the following: Ammonia, benzene, ethyl benzene, hexane, cresol, mercury, methanol, mesitilene, methyl ethyl, ketone, naphthalene, phenol, pentane, coal dust, toluene, hydrogen cyanide, octane, and xylene are the different substances for which there have been measurements made at the different plants. In the overall, all the exposure levels for these substances were lower than the established TLV values. Substances which did exceed the TLV values, were ammonia, benzene, mercury, toluene, and hydrogencyanide. The effective exposure value persentage (EEV%) for these substances were 183 %, 11 7 %, 1500 %, 1 1 %, and 3 17 %. A worker ought not to be exposed to more than a 100 % EEV. It {{is for this reason that}} mercury and hydrogencyanide exposure holds in a definitive risk to exposed workers. The EEV% is worked out for substances for which there were reproduction guideline values available. From these calculations the founding was that benzene, toluene, xylene, <b>coaldust,</b> and mercury had very high EEV%'s. the different values were as follow: 2900 %, 21 9 %, 1200 %, 1 19 %, and 3 100 %. These substances hold in a definitive potential to have harmful effects on female reproduction. From the questionnaires that were used during this study, the founding is that female workers at SASOL experience reproduction abnormalities. The abnormalities are miscarriages, low birth weight babies, early births, and menstrual abnormalities. If the EEV% are compared with the questionnaire's results, the following conclusion can be made: Female workers that are exposed to benzene, toluene, xylene, coal dust, and mercury experience more miscarriages, low birth weight babies, early births, and menstrual abnormalities than non-exposed women.
