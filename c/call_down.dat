5|$|With the Chinese infiltrating the Canadian {{perimeter}} {{through the}} gaps between platoons, D Company was close to being surrounded. The company commander—Captain J.G.W. Mills—was subsequently forced to <b>call</b> <b>down</b> artillery fire onto his own position on several occasions during the early morning of 25 April to avoid being overrun. The tactic succeeded and the exposed Chinese were soon swept off the position, while the dug-in Canadians escaped unharmed. The Chinese persisted however, launching a number of smaller attacks {{during the rest of}} the night, but these were again repulsed by artillery and small arms fire. By dawn the attacks on the Canadian positions had abated, and with D Company remaining in control of the summit they were able to recover the previously abandoned machine-gun at first light. Meanwhile, on the right flank B Company was also able to re-occupy the platoon position it had been forced to relinquish earlier the previous evening. The Chinese had suffered heavily during the night, with perhaps as many as 300 killed by the Patricias.|$|E

First grain and animals of various kinds were placed in compartments within the statue (as in the Rabbinic account). Then the children were offered, at first a few, and then more and more.|$|E
25|$|Instant replay is {{now officially}} sanctioned and standardized. All plays are {{reviewed}} by the replay officials as the play occurs. They may <b>call</b> <b>down</b> to the on-field officials to stop play if they need extra {{time to make a}} review. Each coach may also make one challenge per game. In the case of a coach's challenge, the coach must have at least one time-out remaining. If the challenge is upheld the coach gets the time-out back but the challenge is spent. If the challenge is rejected, both the challenge and the time-out are spent.|$|E

25|$|However Jesus' {{ministry}} {{had little}} in common with that of Elijah; in particular, he preached the forgiveness of one's enemies, while Elijah killed his. Miracle stories similar to those of Elijah were associated with Jesus (e. g. raising of the dead, miraculous feeding). Jesus implicitly separates himself from Elijah when he rebukes James and John for desiring to <b>call</b> <b>down</b> fire upon an unwelcoming Samaritan village in a similar manner to Elijah. Likewise, Jesus rebukes a potential follower who wanted first to return home to say farewell to his family, whereas Elijah permitted this of his replacement Elisha.|$|E
25|$|As such, the Japanese 55th Division ran {{straight}} into the 19th Indian Division strong point at Penwegon; tanks and infantry repelled every attack inflicting huge losses. British forward observation officers {{on the far side}} of the Sittang, continued to <b>call</b> <b>down</b> artillery fire on the Japanese as the survivors attempted to reform and move south; casualties were appalling and it was in reality a one-sided battle. The RAF had also attacked troop concentrations and river craft of all kinds; 273 Squadron and 607 Squadron had killed about 500 Japanese in the village of Hpa-An, when British and Burmese troops came in to take control.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 17/18 July the {{detachment}} attacked the Italian position. It proved to be highly successful, being well-planned and executed. Using the cover of darkness and a carefully laid deception plan, the commandos managed to sneak up behind the Italians position on the hills, and move thorough the forward defensive pits unchallenged. In the end they advanced to within 30 yards of the headquarters before they were challenged, and when they finally were, the force rushed the Italian defenders with sub machine guns and grenades and quickly overwhelmed them. They then withdrew from the position just before the Italians could <b>call</b> <b>down</b> an artillery barrage {{and returned to the}} garrison holding Tobruk. They suffered five casualties in the raid, one of whom later died of his wounds.|$|E

25|$|The plan {{began to}} break down from the beginning. Bad weather and enemy fire delayed the amphibious DD tanks and Royal Marines Armoured Support Group tanks, so {{the first wave of}} {{infantry}} landed at 07.25 without any support. Two control vessels were hit during the run-in, which meant that the planned artillery shoot on le Hamel did not happen, and an attack by RAF Typhoons had failed to suppress its garrison. The leading companies of the 1st Bn Hampshire Regiment lost their senior officers, wireless sets and artillery observers, and were unable to <b>call</b> <b>down</b> supporting fire, but {{when the rest of the}} battalion arrived 20 minutes later they organised an infantry attack on the le Hamel position. On their left the 1st Bn Dorset Regiment had better luck, and with the help of flail tanks of the Westminster Dragoons began to clear beach exits and move inland.|$|E
25|$|Each of {{the three}} {{characters}} have their own unique fighting style and their own specific set of spells and feats. Gameplay strategy is thus different for each character. As Kromlech is a fighter, his spells and feats {{tend to focus on}} increasing his brute strength and ability to resist damage, as well as granting him powerful abilities to aid in melee combat, such as the ability to swing his weapon in a circle or slam it into the ground to damage groups of nearby enemies. As Vahn relies on ranged attacks, his spells and feats tend to focus on increasing the power of his bow and granting him the ability to fire special types of arrows, such as exploding arrows, ice arrows or multiple arrows. As Adrianna is a sorceress, her spells and feats tend to focus on increasing the power of her magic and granting her numerous new spells, such as the ability to shoot ice or fire from her fingers, shoot a ball of thunder or <b>call</b> <b>down</b> meteors on her enemies.|$|E
25|$|Before the New 52, the Trident, {{granted by}} Poseidon to the {{rightful}} ruler and {{protector of the}} seas, was indestructible and a very powerful melee weapon, able to destroy the very powerful Imperiex Probes for instance, which Aquaman wielded with unmatched skill. Apart from its power as a melee weapon, the Trident also {{had the power to}} manipulate water, fire bolts of powerful energy and act as a focus to amplify the magical power of others, most notably Tempest. In the New 52, the Trident is now part of a collection of seven very powerful Atlantean magical items, forged by the first king of Atlantis who calls himself 'The Dead King'. Thought to be the most powerful weapon of the set, {{with the possible exception of}} the recently discovered seventh item, the Trident is completely indestructible and able to hurt even the most powerful of opponents, such as the evil god Darkseid, with Aquaman being the only leaguer to puncture and make him bleed out. He was also able to break the mystical barrier of Dr. Graves which was deemed indestructible at the time. In one instance, the Trident was shown glowing with magical power when Black Manta used the rest of the items to discover the hidden seventh one. For a time, Aquaman withheld the Trident of said aforementioned god of the oceans in his battles against the Thule and Rao's disciples, which gave him the power to summon tsunamis and deluges, <b>call</b> <b>down</b> thunder and lighting, project and control ice, move the earth making it rise and tremble at his command, as well as teleport himself from global to interplanetary distances using water as a medium. It could also transform into a gladius and back at will. Arthur also uses both versions of the trident to boost the range his telepathy.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to physical assaults, Conan can use magic powers to damage enemies. Gaining these powers in later {{stages of the}} game, the barbarian can turn opponents into stone, <b>call</b> <b>down</b> fire from the heavens, and summon flocks of ravens to do his bidding. These magical attacks can quickly end fights, but their use {{is limited by the}} number of magic points Conan has. When an enemy is killed, colored runes—each one conferring its own special advantage—are released and gathered by the barbarian. Red runes act as experience points, which are exchanged for advanced attacks. Green and blue runes restore Conan's health and magic points, respectively. [...] The barbarian can also obtain runes by breaking containers and freeing maidens from captivity.|$|E
500|$|Through their {{research}} into Project Meteor, the Garleans discovered {{a way to}} <b>call</b> <b>down</b> the lesser moon Dalamud {{and use it as}} a weapon. The plan—spearheaded by the Imperial Legatus Nael van Darnus—was to crash Dalamud into Eorzea, annihilating the beastmen tribes and their primal deities and conquering the smoldering remains. In response to this threat, the three nations of the former Eorzean Alliance reinstated their Grand Companies and reforged their pact. A band of adventurers defeated van Darnus but could not stop Dalamud's continued descent. During a major battle between the Grand Companies and the leaderless Garlean invasion force at the Carteneau Flats in Mor Dhona, Dalamud revealed itself to be an ancient Allagan-made prison for the primal dragon Bahamut, who promptly escaped to initiate the Seventh Umbral Calamity. The Sharlayan scholar Louisoix Leveilleur attempted to recontain Bahamut using the Twelve's power but, failing that, sent a group of adventurers [...] "beyond the reach of time" [...] to reawaken when they were needed again.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, the Japanese 23rd Infantry Regiment, {{which had}} {{advanced}} {{on the right}} flank from Barara attempted to move on Slater's Knoll from the north. Finding its way blocked by wire obstacles and lacking the equipment necessary to remove them, it was forced to halt its advance and cover the flank of Colonel Toyoji Muta's 13th Infantry Regiment, which was attempting to launch an assault across the Puriata. At this point, the river was about [...] across and [...] deep, while the opposite bank was about [...] high. The crossing began at 03:00 on 1 April, and the three battalions made heavy work of it. When they were halfway across, the two forward battalions were spotted by the Australians in the moonlight and engaged with machine gun and rifle fire. The Japanese quickly deployed and attempted to launch an attack; however, in the confusion the 1st Battalion, 23rd Infantry Regiment was {{cut off from the}} rest of the assault force. As daylight came, the Australians were able to <b>call</b> <b>down</b> mortar fire on the Japanese, causing considerable casualties. Running low on ammunition and having suffered considerable losses, the 23rd Infantry were forced to withdraw. The 1st Battalion [...] remained cut off until the evening of 1 April, when it was able to re-establish contact with the other two battalions and report to the divisional commander that the attack had been unsuccessful.|$|E

It had to be resupplied by air drops during this time. By dawn the Chinese attack on the Canadian position had abated, and in the afternoon of 25 April the road through to the Canadians had been cleared of Chinese, at which time the 2nd Battalion was relieved.|$|E
2500|$|Anderson {{continued}} {{a tradition}} aboard the International Space Station, started by Michael Lopez-Alegria, of conducting daily [...] "trivia" [...] contests with mission control team {{members on the}} ground.

Anderson has taken this tradition and put his own personal twist on it, using the [...] "Book of Answers: The New York Public Library Telephone Reference Service's Most Unusual and Entertaining Questions". Anderson often played song clips for the ground control team, or specific individuals, most notably when he played the song [...] "(Everything I Do) I Do It for You" [...] by Bryan Adams for his wife on her birthday.|$|E
2500|$|In New Mexico, U.S., {{scientists}} {{tested a}} new terawatt laser which provoked lightning. Scientists fired ultra-fast pulses from an extremely powerful laser thus sending several terawatts into the clouds to <b>call</b> <b>down</b> electrical discharges in storm clouds over the region. The laser beams sent from the laser make channels of ionized molecules known as [...] "filaments". Before the lightning strikes earth, the filaments lead electricity through the clouds, {{playing the role}} of lightning rods. Researchers generated filaments that lived a period too short to trigger a real lightning strike. Nevertheless, a boost in electrical activity within the clouds was registered. According to the French and German scientists who ran the experiment, the fast pulses sent from the laser will be able to provoke lightning strikes on demand. Statistical analysis showed that their laser pulses indeed enhanced the electrical activity in the thundercloud where it was aimed—in effect they generated small local discharges located at the position of the plasma channels.|$|E

2500|$|Smith {{requested}} close air support, {{calling for}} the waiting aircraft to drop napalm across 11 Platoon's eastern frontage. The Phantoms soon arrived; however, due to the rain and low cloud {{they were unable to}} observe the coloured smoke thrown by the Australians to mark their position through the trees. Stanley was forced to halt the artillery while the aircraft flew overhead, yet with Smith unable to establish communications with the forward air observer he wanted them out of the area so it could resume firing. Townsend directed the aircraft drop their payloads on the forward slopes of Nui Dat 2 instead, believing it the location of the Viet Cong command element. With the artillery beginning to fall again and D Company still heavily outnumbered, it proved critical in preventing them being overrun as the Viet Cong formed assault waves. Major Harry Honnor—officer commanding 161st Battery, RNZA attached to 6 RAR in direct support—served as Townsend's artillery advisor at Nui Dat and during the battle controlled the fires of the three field batteries, as well as directing the American medium artillery against depth targets. On the ground Stanley would <b>call</b> <b>down</b> the fire himself or would relay the direction of the assault, from which Honnor would select targets and order the fire, which was then adjusted by Stanley using sound ranging to bring it closer. Despite the rain and the soft ground reducing the impact of the artillery, its effectiveness was aided by otherwise favourable technical conditions, including the location of the infantry between the guns and the assaulting Viet Cong, the convenient range of [...] at which the engagement occurred, good communications afforded by the newly issued PRC-25 radios, the air burst effect created by rounds exploding in the trees, and the large supply of rounds stock-piled at Nui Dat.|$|E
