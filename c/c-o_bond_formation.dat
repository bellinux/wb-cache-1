50|$|As {{seen in the}} {{mechanism}} above, bornyl diphosphate synthase catalyzes the cyclization cascade of GPP into (+)- bornyl diphosphate. Following the initial metal-activated diphosphate departure from GPP, the molecule isomerizes to linalyl diphosphate (LPP), which then allows for the rotation around the carbon-carbon bond, and consequent reattachment of the PPi group. The pyrophosphate then stabilizes the cyclization into the terpinyl cation, and another final cyclization yields the 2-bornyl cation. This cation is then neutralized by the stereo-specific <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> <b>formation</b> with the final re-attachment of pyrophosphate to create the final product, BPP. Careful consideration of the BPPS structure shows that the active site, discussed in further detail below, guides the positions and conformations of the isoprenoid functionality of the substrate, while the diphosphate position remains essentially anchored in a single location and conformation. Overall, the pyrophosphate {{plays an important role}} in stabilizing the carbocations formed throughout the cyclization in the active site of the enzyme. These interactions and the strategic positioning of pyrophosphate is what is believed to lead to its endo-specific recapture in the final step by the bornyl cation.|$|E
40|$|As {{fossil fuel}} {{resources}} {{become more and more}} scarce, attention has been turned to alternative sources of fuels and energy. One promising prospect is the conversion of methane (natural gas) to methanol, which requires an initial activation of a C-H bond and subsequent formation of a C-O bond. The most well studied methodologies for both C-H activation and <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> <b>formation</b> involve oxidation of the metal center. Metal complexes with facile access to oxidation states separated by four charge units, required for two subsequent oxidations, are rare. Non-oxidative methods to perform C-H bond activation or <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> <b>formation</b> must be pursued in order for methane to methanol to become a viable strategy. In this dissertation studies on redox and non-redox methods for both C-H activation and <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> <b>formation</b> are discussed. In the early chapters <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> <b>formation</b> in the form of reductive functionalization is modeled. Polypyridine ligated rhodium complexes were studied computationally to determine the properties that would promote reductive functionalization. These principles were then tested by designing an experimental complex that could form C-O bonds. This complex was then shown to also work in acidic media, a critical aspect for product stabilization. In the later chapters, non-oxidative C-H activation is discussed with Ir complexes. Both sigma bond metathesis and concerted metalation deprotonation were investigated. For the former, the mechanism for an experimentally known complex was elucidated and for the latter the controlling factors for a proposed catalyst were explored...|$|E
40|$|The {{reaction}} {{mechanism of the}} L-proline-catalyzed alpha-aminoxylation reaction between aldehyde and nitrosobenzene has been investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Our calculation results reveal following conclusions [1]. The first step that corresponds {{to the formation of}} C-O bond, is the stereocontrolling and rate-determining step [2]. Among four reaction channels, the syn-attack reaction channel is more favorable than that of the anti one, and the TS-ss channel dominates among the four channels for this reaction in the step of <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> <b>formation</b> [3]. The intermolecular hydrogen bond between the acidic hydrogen of L-proline and the N atom of the nitrosobenzene in an early stage of the process catalyzes very effectively the <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> <b>formation</b> by a large stabilization of the negative charge that is developing at the O atom along the electrophilic attack [4]. The effect of solvent decreases the activation energy, and also, the calculated energy barriers are decrease with the enhancement of dielectric constants for <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> <b>formation</b> step. These results are in good agreement with experiment, and allow us to explain the origin of the catalysis and stereoselectivity for L-proline-catalyzed alpha-aminoxylation of aldehyde reaction. The addition of H 2 O to substituted imine proline, intermolecular proton-transfer steps, and the L-proline elimination process were also studied in this paper...|$|E

The reactivity of dialkyl peroxides towards organometallics such as alkyl lithium and magnesium reagents is known.

The method was applied to synthesis of a variety of functionalized ethers, including S,S,O-orthoesters, difluoroethers, mixed O,O-acetals, and cyclopropyl ethers.

Two new metabolites, HFB 3 and HFB 4, which are biosynthetic precursors of fumonisins lacking the tricarballylic esters, were detected in the mutant. The results suggest that FUM 14 is required for the esterification of fumonisins. FUM 14 was predicted to encode a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) containing two domains, peptidyl carrier protein and condensation domain. Both the intact Fum 14 p and the condensation domain have been expressed in Escherichia coli and purified for activity assays. Fum 14 p was able to convert HFB 3 and HFB 4 to the tricarballylic esters-containing fumonisins, FB 3 and FB 4, respectively, when incubated with tricarballylic thioester of N-acetylcysteamine. In addition, the condensation domain was able to convert HFB 1 to FB 1. These data provide direct evidence for the role of Fum 14 p in the esterification of fumonisins. More interestingly, the results are the first example of an NRPS condensation domain catalyzing a <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> (ester) <b>formation,</b> instead of the typical C-N <b>bond</b> (amide) <b>formation</b> in nonribosomal peptides. The understanding of the esterification mechanism provides useful knowledge for mycotoxin reduction and elimination. The study also provides new insight into the reactions catalyzed by NRPS...|$|R
