5|$|The {{effect of}} the {{maritime}} fur trade in Southern China by itself was probably not great. The <b>Canton</b> trade as a whole had limited effect on China, mostly limited to the tea growers of Fujian, the silk producers of Nanjing, the craftsmen of <b>Canton,</b> and various middlemen, and merchants. The ruling Manchus kept foreign trade by ship at bay. It was restricted to <b>Canton,</b> and even there was allowed only outside the city walls. China was generally self-sufficient. The main {{effect of the}} Old China Trade was an increased import of opium and related outflow of specie, which resulted in China being incorporated into the capitalist world system after 1830.
