5|$|Outcome {{is related}} to the extent and {{duration}} of lead exposure. Effects of lead on the physiology of the kidneys and blood are generally reversible; its effects on the <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> are not. While peripheral effects in adults often go away when lead exposure ceases, evidence suggests that most of lead's effects on a child's <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> are irreversible. Children with lead poisoning may thus have adverse health, cognitive, and behavioral effects that follow them into adulthood.|$|E
5|$|The main {{manifestations of}} carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning develop in the organ systems most dependent on oxygen use, the <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> and the heart. The initial symptoms of acute carbon monoxide poisoning include headache, nausea, malaise, and fatigue. These symptoms are often mistaken for a virus such as influenza or other illnesses such as food poisoning or gastroenteritis. Headache {{is the most common}} symptom of acute carbon monoxide poisoning; it is often described as dull, frontal, and continuous. Increasing exposure produces cardiac abnormalities including fast heart rate, low blood pressure, and cardiac arrhythmia; <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> symptoms include delirium, hallucinations, dizziness, unsteady gait, confusion, seizures, <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> depression, unconsciousness, respiratory arrest, and death. Less common symptoms of acute carbon monoxide poisoning include myocardial ischemia, atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, high blood sugar, lactic acidosis, muscle necrosis, acute kidney failure, skin lesions, and visual and auditory problems.|$|E
5|$|Amanita regalis is poisonous. A case of {{poisoning}} {{was reported}} from Finland, where three individuals {{believed they had}} consumed the edible parasol mushroom Macrolepiota procera. The symptoms of poisoning, which began 1–2hours after ingestion of the mushrooms, were gastrointestinal—nausea and heavy vomiting. Two had <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> manifestations and cholinergic symptoms, including hallucinations, confusion, or loss of consciousness as well as profuse salivation and sweating. All three individuals recovered within 4–24hours without any damage to liver, kidneys or the <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system.</b> As this incident demonstrates, cooking the mushrooms does not completely neutralize the toxic components of Amanita regalis. Chemical analysis has shown that this species contains ibotenic acid and muscimol, the same toxic constituents as Amanita muscaria.|$|E

There was no effect of in utero exposure on the immune system (assay of circulating antibodies directed against specific antigens) and <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>systems</b> (apoptosis).

In 1988, Hamilton et al. wrote procedures for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to establish oxygen exposure limits for habitat operations.

5|$|Symptoms from {{exposure}} to organic lead, which is probably more toxic than inorganic lead due to its lipid solubility, occur rapidly.

5|$|The <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> {{consists}} of a brain and paired ventral nerve cords that connect to the brain and run {{along the length of}} the body. The brain is a ring of four ganglia, masses of nerve cells, positioned round the rhynchocoel near its front end – while the brains of most protostome invertebrates encircle the foregut. Most nemertean species have just one pair of nerve cords, many species have additional paired cords, and some species also have a dorsal cord. In some species the cords lie within the skin, but in most they are deeper, inside the muscle layers. The <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> is often red or pink because it contains hemoglobin. This stores oxygen for peak activity or when the animal experiences anoxia, for example while burrowing in oxygen-free sediments.|$|E

5|$|Bromine has {{sometimes}} been considered to be possibly essential in humans, but this is supported by only limited circumstantial evidence, and no clear biological role.

40|$|Intravascular lymphomatosis (IL) is a {{rare and}} {{generally}} fatal disease characterized by proliferation of large lymphoma cells almost exclusively within the lumen of small blood vessels.

Predominant lung involvement without cutaneous and neurologic manifestation is very rare and difficult to diagnose.

40|$|Abstract—Determination of attentional {{status is}} {{important}} because working performance and an unexpected accident is highly related with the attention. The autonomic <b>nervous</b> and the <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>systems</b> can reflect the changes in person’s attentional status. Reduced number of suitable pysiological parameters among autonomic and <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>systems</b> related signal parameters will be critical in optimum design of attentional devices. In this paper, we analyze the EEG (Electroencephalography) and HRV (Heart Rate Variability) signals to demonstrate the effective relation with brain signal and cardiovascular signal during event-related attention, which will be later used in selecting the minimum set of attentional parameters. Time and frequency domain parameters from HRV signal and frequency domain parameters from EEG signal are used as input to the optimum feature parameters selector.
