40|$|Open source {{software}} (OSS) {{has become}} an increasingly threatening competitor to traditional proprietary software. In this paper, we study the competition between proprietary and OSS by considering consumer’s taste difference using a Hotelling model. In particular, we seek to answer how commercial software vendors should optimally set the price and design its product. Our analysis suggests that the optimal strategy of the <b>commercial</b> <b>firm</b> is dependent on consumer’s fit cost and the positioning (design) of open source software. Specifically, we find that if the OSS is targeted to consumers with extreme requirements, the <b>commercial</b> <b>firm</b> should serve only a proportion of the entire population and the <b>commercial</b> <b>firm’s</b> profit is maximized. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the social welfare is maximized when open source software targets more specialized users. Further, In the presence of positive network externalities, the <b>commercial</b> <b>firm</b> enjoys greater profit when there’s positive network effect. However, the <b>commercial</b> <b>firm’s</b> profit is not monotonically increasing or decreasing in network intensity...|$|R

50|$|In 1997 Representative Leach again {{sponsored}} {{a bill to}} repeal Glass-Steagall Sections 20 and 32. At first the main controversy was whether to permit limited affiliations between <b>commercial</b> <b>firms</b> and <b>commercial</b> banks. Securities <b>firms</b> (and other financial services firms) complained that unless they could retain their affiliations with <b>commercial</b> <b>firms</b> (which the Bank Holding Company Act forbid for a commercial bank), {{they would not be}} able to compete equally with commercial banks. The Clinton Administration proposed that Congress either permit a small “basket” of commercial revenue for bank holding companies or that it retain the “unitary thrift loophole” that permitted a <b>commercial</b> <b>firm</b> to own a single savings and loan. Representative Leach, House Banking Committee Ranking Member Henry Gonzalez (D-TX), and former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker opposed such commercial affiliations.|$|R
40|$|Context: Open Source Software (OSS) {{development}} is a highly distributed and collaborative activity and was initially performed by developers volunteering their time and effort. During the recent years, OSS has transformed to become a more mainstream and commercially viable software development approach. This {{is reflected in the}} increasing involvement from <b>commercial</b> <b>firms.</b> Currently, there exist little or no research literature examining how <b>commercial</b> <b>firms</b> collaborate across organizational boundaries and how this may affect community-based OSS projects. Objective: This thesis aims to help fill the identified gap by investigating the influence of organizational boundary on team collaboration and project evolution in community-based OSS projects by answering the following research questions: RQ 1 : How do <b>commercial</b> <b>firms</b> collaborate across organizational boundaries in community-based OSS projects?RQ 2 : How influential is firm awareness in community-based OSS projects?Method: A two-phased case study approach was adopted, compromising exploratory and descriptive analysis. The cases, Wireshark and Samba, were examined in a quantitative and qualitative approach using found documents and conducting interviews with firm-paid developers. Social network and thematic content analysis were applied. Results: This thesis provides the following three contributions:C 1 : Empirical data from two OSS projects providing knowledge related to how <b>commercial</b> <b>firms</b> collaborate with each others across organizational boundaries in community-based OSS projects. C 2 : A conceptual model illustrating <b>commercial</b> <b>firm?s</b> collaboration patterns across organizational boundaries in community-based OSS projects, extending Crowston?s onion model. C 3 : A set of recommendations to <b>commercial</b> <b>firms</b> that want to participate and utilize community-based OSS projects. Conclusion: <b>Commercial</b> <b>firms</b> participate and collaborate heavily in community-based OSS projects and are present in all the roles identified in Crowston?s onion model. Furthermore, independently of firm size and degree of involvement, the firms commonly have one person acting as a gatekeeper between the community and firm managing code, communication and/or bug issues. The findings indicate that firm awareness is {{a vital part of the}} firm cross-collaboration and mainly influence the development in a positive manner. </p...|$|R

40|$|During 2005 - 2006, Wal-Mart, Home Depot, {{and several}} other <b>commercial</b> <b>firms</b> applied to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for {{permission}} to acquire FDIC-insured industrial loan companies (ILCs). Those applications were opposed by business groups, labor unions, community activists, and members of Congress. In January 2007, the FDIC imposed a one-year moratorium on all acquisitions of ILCs by <b>commercial</b> <b>firms</b> and asked Congress to determine whether such acquisitions should be prohibited. As the FDIC noted, acquisitions of ILCs by <b>commercial</b> <b>firms</b> raise three important policy issues, which are addressed in this Article. First, commercial ownership of ILCs conflicts with the policy of separating banking and commerce, which has been generally followed in the United States since 1787 and has gained strength over time. Banks have frequently tried to engage in commercial activities, and <b>commercial</b> <b>firms</b> have often attempted {{to gain control of}} banks. However, federal and state legislators have repeatedly passed laws to separate banking and commerce whenever it appeared that either (i) the involvement of banks in commercial activities threatened their safety and soundness, or (ii) <b>commercial</b> <b>firms</b> were acquiring large numbers of banks. ILCs represent the last remaining exception to the policy of prohibiting commercial ownership of banks. Second, acquisitions of ILCs by <b>commercial</b> <b>firms</b> will produce serious risks for our nation 2 ̆ 7 s financial system and economy. Commercially-owned ILCs will extend federal safety net subsidies to the commercial sector, and ILCs will have strong incentives to make loans and investments that benefit their commercial affiliates. Commercial ownership of ILCs therefore creates a competitive imbalance between <b>commercial</b> <b>firms</b> that own ILCs and those that do not. Commercially-owned ILCs are also vulnerable to contagious losses of confidence resulting from problems at their parent companies. Accordingly, federal regulators may feel compelled to arrange too big to fail bailouts of large troubled parent companies of ILCs. Third, the FDIC currently does not have authority to exercise consolidated supervision over commercial owners of ILCs. Any grant of such authority to the FDIC would have adverse consequences. The FDIC does not have the expertise or resources to identify and control the risks presented by commercial owners of ILCs. In addition, mandating FDIC supervision of commercial parent companies would significantly increase the federal government 2 ̆ 7 s interference in the general economy. FDIC supervision of commercial owners could also impair market discipline by causing market participants to expect FDIC support for such owners during financial crises. For all these reasons, Congress should prohibit further acquisitions of ILCs by <b>commercial</b> <b>firms...</b>|$|R
40|$|Research problem: There is {{a current}} trend for law <b>firm</b> <b>libraries</b> {{to reduce their}} print collections, {{particularly}} during office refurbishments. This research explores if recent downsizing of print collections in large law <b>firm</b> <b>libraries</b> in New Zealand has had any impact on access to legal information for their clients. Methodology: Six law librarians working in large law firms in Auckland were interviewed in a qualitative phenomenology research study. Results: Well-resourced law <b>firm</b> <b>libraries</b> are able to maintain a similar level of access to legal information after a downsizing of their print collections. There are external factors affecting access that are beyond the firm’s control but these concerns are minimised by their law librarians’ professional knowledge and skills to locate less common legal resources. Their library clients have embraced alternatives to print collections of legal information but their awareness {{of the range of}} sources available and legal research skills, both basic and complex, may be insufficient. Print material and the traditional research skills using print legal material will still be required by law <b>firm</b> <b>library</b> clients for the foreseeable future. Implications: There are concerns that some legal material may be lost unless there is a coordinated effort by institutions to preserve less common items. Specialist legal information sources are constantly evolving and law library clients need targeted end user training to master the specialist information seeking skills needed in an electronic legal environment. Future research: Interview or survey lawyers in large law firms to discover their attitudes to finding and using non-print legal resources.
