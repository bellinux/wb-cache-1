Corporate governance mechanisms ensure the interests of shareholders, creditors, customers and other interested parties which are established through optimal decisions of executive committees and compiling the <b>compulsory</b> <b>rules</b> and regulations. All these serve four purposes: accountability, clarity, justice and respecting the rights of interested parties. The present study evaluated the effects of mechanisms of corporate governance on voluntary disclosure of information in Automotive and manufacturing industries, Basic metals and food and pharmaceutical productsfor a period of eight years from 2002 to 2009. Independent variables used here are corporate governance mechanisms including indirect directors (ID), ownership centralization (OC), institutional ownership (IO), free float (FF), and auditor type (AT). The dependent variable is voluntary disclosure (VD) of information in companies which is obtained, according to Jensen index, by the ratio of voluntary disclosure of corporate information divided by total amount of voluntary disclosure (62 cases). Control variables include corporate value, obtained from natural logarithm of sales, and financial leverage which is obtained by long-term debts divided by total assets {{at the end of}} each financial year. Overall, results of the study showed a significant relation between all of the mechanisms indirect directors’ ratio, ownership centralization, institutional ownership, free float with voluntary disclosure of information, but no significant relation between auditor type –with voluntary disclosure was observed in the industry during the study...|$|R
40|$|Even in {{the absence}} of an {{applicable}} statute or court rule, failure to assert an available counterclaim precludes bringing a subsequent action thereon if granting relief would nullify the judgment in the initial action. This so-called common-law <b>compulsory</b> counterclaim <b>rule</b> emerges from the intuitive principle of claim preclusion that a valid and final judgment generally precludes the defendant from later asserting mere defenses to the claim. The implicit extension of this idea is that once a plaintiff obtains a judgment, the defendant generally cannot bring a new action to undo the judgment by reopening the plaintiff’s claim and pushing those defenses. The evident rationale is that claim preclusion simply must apply when the effect of the defendant’s collaterally asserted defense would be to nullify the earlier judgment for the plaintiff. This implicit barrier to collateral attack may seem to occupy some arcane corner of the specialty of res judicata. But the common-law <b>compulsory</b> counterclaim <b>rule</b> in fact is critical to any judicial system. That is, although it is intuitive, it is also important. The rule applies whether or not the prior judgment was by default; the rule indeed is especially important because it works to guarantee that even default judgments mean something and cannot normally be undone by later litigation. The rule applies whether or not a compulsory counterclaim statute or rule of court exists; that fact explains why its very name declares it to be a common-law doctrine.

40|$|A {{property}} rights-based {{approach is}} {{proposed in the}} paper to underline the common characteristics of the forest property rights specification in ten ECE countries, the specific patterns governing the harvesting of timber in private forestry {{and the role of}} the forest management planning in determining the content of the property rights. The analysis deals with the private forests of the individuals (non industrial ownership) from ten countries, covering 7. 3 million ha and producing yearly some 25 million m 3 timber. The study shows that the forest management rights in private forests belong to the State and that the withdrawal rights on timber, yet recognised in the forest management plans, are in reality strongly restricted from an economic viewpoint. The forest management planning is the key instrument of the current forest governance system, based on top-down, hierarchically imposed and enforced set of <b>compulsory</b> <b>rules</b> on timber harvesting. With few exceptions, the forest owners have little influence in the forest planning and harvesting. The rational and State-lead approach of the private forest management has serious implications not only on the economic content of the property rights, but also on the learning and adaptive capacity of private forestry to cope with current challenges such the climate change, the increased industry needs for wood as raw material, or the marketing of innovative non wood forest products and services. The study highlights that understanding and comparing the regime of the forest ownership require a special analysis of the economic rights attached to each forest attribute; and that the evolution towards more participatory decision-making in the local forest governance can not be accurately assessed in ECE region without a proper understanding of the forest management planning process.  </span...|$|R
40|$|Background & Problem Discussion: The {{collapse}} of Enron together {{with several other}} scandals contributed {{to the creation of}} the Sarbanes Oxley Act, imposing heavy demands on accounting ethics for businesses listed on the stock exchange in the US. In Sweden, the Swedish Code of Corporate Governance was introduced, but instead of being a law, it is based on self-regulation. The purpose of both SOX and the Code is to gain the trust of potential investors by ensuring that companies are managed as effectively as possible in accordance with the interests and the objectives of the share holders. As both exist for a common purpose, this study will try to answer which one that better fulfills the purpose, by investigating Swedish companies view on the topic. Purpose: This study will try to answer, out of Swedish companies’ perspective, what is most effective, self-regulation, with the possibility to either comply or give an explanation for not complying, or detailed regulation by law? Delimitations: This study is limited to investigating companies listed on the US or Swedish stock market. Focus is put on Sarbanes-Oxley Act and Swedish Code of Corporate Governance, in particular their regulation of internal control. Methodology: Initially, laws and regulations were investigated to form a framework upon which further studies throughout the report were based. The empiric consists of eight interviews, which were summarized and analyzed, from which conclusions were drawn. Result and Conclusions: There is no reason to abandon self-regulation. Instead, an overall better framework with some <b>compulsory</b> <b>rules</b> should be developed, in order to provide the best possible help in improving the internal control. Suggestions on Future Studies: In would be interesting to study what view the accounting firms have on the topic.

Finally, it would be interesting to investigate if companies have a different view on internal control in a few years from now...|$|R
5000|$|In principle, a corporation's {{constitution}} can {{be designed}} in any way {{so long as it}} complies with the <b>compulsory</b> <b>rules</b> set down by the state or federal legislature. Most state laws, and the federal government, give a broad freedom to corporations to design the relative rights of directors, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders in the articles of incorporation and the by-laws. These are written down during incorporation, and can usually be amended afterwards according to the state law's procedures, which sometimes place obstacles to amendment by a simple majority of shareholders. In the early 1819 case of Trustees of Dartmouth College v Woodward the US Supreme Court held by a majority that there was a presumption that once a corporate charter was made, the corporation's constitution was subject to [...] "no other control {{on the part of the}} Crown than what is expressly or implicitly reserved by the charter itself." [...] On the facts, this meant that because Dartmouth College's charter could not be amended by the New Hampshire legislature, though subsequent state corporation laws subsequently included provisions saying that this could be done. Today there is a general presumption that whatever balance of powers, rights and duties are set down in the constitution remain binding like a contract would. Most corporation statutes start with a presumption (in contrast to old ultra vires rules) that corporations may pursue any purpose that is lawful, whether that is running a profitable business, delivering services to the community, or any other objects that people involved in a corporation may choose. By default, the common law had historically suggested that all decisions are to be taken by a majority of the incorporators, and that by default the board could be removed by a majority of shareholders for a reason they themselves determined. However these default rules will take subject to the constitution that incorporators themselves define, which in turn take subject to state law and federal regulation.|$|R
