5|$|Insects {{form part}} of the human diet in some cultures, and in Thailand, crickets are farmed for this purpose in the north of the country and palm weevil larvae in the south. The crickets are kept in pens, boxes or drawers and fed on {{commercial}} pelleted poultry food, while the palm weevil larvae live on <b>cabbage</b> <b>palm</b> and sago palm trees, which limits their production to areas where these trees grow. Another delicacy of this region is the bamboo caterpillar, and the best rearing and harvesting techniques in semi-natural habitats are being studied.|$|E
5|$|Some of the driest {{land in the}} Everglades is pineland (also called pine rockland) ecosystem, {{located in}} the highest part of the Everglades with little to no hydroperiod. Some floors, however, may have flooded {{solution}} holes or puddles {{for a few months}} at a time. The most significant feature of the pineland is the single species of South Florida slash pine (Pinus elliottii). Pineland communities require fire to maintain them, and the trees have several adaptations that simultaneously promote and resist fire. The sandy floor of the pine forest is covered with dry pine needles that are highly flammable. South Florida slash pines are insulated by their bark to protect them from heat. Fire eliminates competing vegetation on the forest floor, and opens pine cones to germinate seeds. A period without significant fire can turn pineland into a hardwood hammock as larger trees overtake the slash pines. The understory shrubs in pine rocklands are the fire-resistant saw palmetto (Serenoa repens), <b>cabbage</b> <b>palm</b> (Sabal palmetto), and West Indian lilac (Tetrazygia bicolor). The most diverse group of plants in the pine community are the herbs, of which there are two dozen species. These plants contain tubers and other mechanisms that allow them to sprout quickly after being charred.|$|E

25|$|The Tequesta {{gathered}} many plant foods, including {{saw palmetto}} (Serenoa repens) berries, cocoplums (Chrysobalanus icaco), sea grapes (Coccoloba uvifera), prickly pear (nopal) fruits (Opuntia spp.), gopher apples (Licania micbauxii), pigeon plums (Cocoloba diversifolia), palm nuts, false mastic seeds, <b>cabbage</b> <b>palm</b> (Sabal palmetto), and hog plum (Ximenia americana). The roots of certain plants, such as Smilax spp. and coontie (Zamia integrifolia), were edible when ground into flour, processed to remove toxins (in {{the case of}} coontie), and made into a type of unleavened bread. (Archaeologists have commented, however, {{on the lack of}} evidence for coontie use in excavated sites.) Briton Hammond, the sole survivor of an English sloop that was attacked by Tequestas after grounding off Key Biscayne in 1748, reported that the Tequestas fed him boil'd corn.|$|E
25|$|This species {{typically}} inhabits wooded areas near permanent {{water sources}} or coastal habitats with Spanish moss (Tillandsia usneoides) or palm trees. In the southeastern United States, L. intermedius distribution almost always coincides with Spanish moss, which they use for both roost and maternity sites. Bats roost within the Spanish moss itself or beneath the dead hanging fronds of fan palm trees. A single palm tree or live oak tree draped in Spanish moss may {{be home to}} several individuals year-round, and multiple pregnant and lactating females may form a maternity colony, despite the solitary nature of most Lasiurine bats. One study found bats favored Sand live oaks (Quercus geminata) with an average roost height of 2.23 m above the ground and 1.57 m above the nearest vegetation. The average length of a roost was 0.98 m and average width was 0.44 m. Clumps of Spanish moss used for roosting sites were 2-3 times larger than clumps of un-used Spanish moss in the area. All roosts were within 1 m of the sandy road and less than 11 m from a lake. These bats frequently changed their roost site. In August 2003, a male northern yellow bat was found roosting {{on the underside of}} a partially dead frond of <b>cabbage</b> <b>palm</b> (Sabal palmetto) along the edge of Lake August in a residential lawn in Florida. The cryptic coloration of this species makes it difficult to spot on the brown frond of a palm.|$|E

2500|$|Mollusk {{shells and}} wood {{were used to}} make {{hammering}} and pounding tools. Mollusks shells and shark teeth were used for grating, cutting, carving and engraving. The Calusa wove nets from palm-fiber cord. Cord was also made from <b>Cabbage</b> <b>Palm</b> leaves, saw palmetto trunks, Spanish moss, false sisal (Agave decipiens) and the bark of cypress and willow trees. The Calusa also made fish traps, weirs, and fish corrals from wood and cord. Artifacts of wood {{that have been found}} include bowls, ear ornaments, masks, plaques, [...] "ornamental standards," [...] and a finely carved deer head. The plaques and other objects were often painted. To date no one has found a Calusa dugout canoe, but it is speculated that such vessels would have been constructed from the same trees used by other Florida Indian people- cypress and pine. [...] The process of shaping the boat was achieved by burning the middle and subsequently chopping and removing the charred center, using robust shell tools. (In 1954 a dugout canoe was found during excavation for a middle school in Marathon, Florida. It was not conserved and is in poor shape, but it is displayed at the nature center in Marathon.

Four raised, circular or elliptical garden beds were set out within open grassed areas of the park - three along the River Road side and one north of the walkway leading from Reef Street to the bandstand. Unlike the laneway rockeries, they do not appear to have been edged with stone. A few perimeter shade trees had been planted, but much of the area east of the bandstand remained an open grassy space, where seats were set out when band concerts were being performed.|$|R
