40|$|The {{drive to}} reduce carbon {{emissions}} from domestic housing {{has led to}} a recent shift of focus from new-build to retrofit. However there are two significant differences. Firstly more work is needed to retrofit existing housing to the same energy efficiency standards as new-build. Secondly the remaining length of service life is potentially shorter. This implies that the capital expenditure – both financial and carbon - of retrofit may be disproportionate to the savings gained over the remaining life. However the Government’s definition of low and zero carbon continues to exclude the capital (embodied) <b>carbon</b> <b>costs</b> of construction, which has resulted in a lack of data for comparison. The paper addresses this gap by reporting the embodied <b>carbon</b> <b>costs</b> of retrofitting four individual pilot properties in Rampton Drift, part of an Eco-Town Demonstrator Project in Cambridgeshire. Through collecting details of the materials used and their journeys from manufacturer to site, the paper conducts a ‘cradle-to-gate’ life cycle carbon assessment for each property. The embodied carbon figures are calculated using a software tool being developed by the Centre for Sustainable Development at the University of Cambridge. The key aims are to assess the real embodied <b>carbon</b> <b>costs</b> of retrofit of domestic properties, and to test the new tool; it is hoped that the methodology, the tool and the specific findings will be transferable to other projects. Initial changes in operational energy {{as a result of the}} retrofit works will be reported and compared with the embodied <b>carbon</b> <b>costs</b> when presenting this paper...|$|R

40|$|Life cycle {{assessment}} (LCA) involves many temporal issues. It {{is necessary}} to make {{a clear distinction between}} long-term impacts and short-term impacts, especially for those structures with long service life, such as buildings. With their long service life of 50 years, a great deal of maintenance and repairs could be conducted, causing a respective environmental impact. In this paper we explored a monetization method to convert the life cycle environmental impact into a life cycle environmental cost to address the temporal issues involved in LCA by discounting. This method can facilitate decision-making when tradeoffs between current and future environmental impacts exist. Moreover, this method can be used as an effective supplement to life cycle cost and provide decision support for making trade-off between cost and environmental impact. Finally, a building located in Xiamen City, China was selected as a case study and analyzed by the proposal LCA method. The results indicated that <b>carbon</b> <b>cost</b> in the operational stage is the maximum, building material production and transportation stages are ranked second, and the amount in the demolition stage is negligible, compared with the other three stages. Additionally, with the increase of the discount rate, the <b>carbon</b> <b>cost</b> in different life cycle stages will decrease, the percentage of the <b>carbon</b> <b>cost</b> in the operational stage will gradually decrease, but the percentage of the <b>carbon</b> <b>cost</b> in building material production and transportation stages will gradually increase...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this study, the {{opportunity}} to invest in {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) plants and second-generation biofuel production plants in Europe is investigated. To determine the number and type of production plants, a mixed integer linear model is used, based on minimization of the total cost of the whole supply chain. Different policy scenarios are studied with varying values of <b>carbon</b> <b>cost</b> and biofuel support. The study focuses on the type of technology to invest in and the CO 2 emission substitution potential, at constant energy prices. The CHP plants and the biofuel production plants are competing for the same feedstock (forest biomass), which is available in limited quantities. The results show that CHP plants are preferred over biofuel production plants at high carbon costs (over 50 EUR/tCO 2) and low biofuel support (below 10 EUR/GJ), whereas more biofuel production plants would be set up at high biofuel support (over 15 EUR/GJ), irrespective of the <b>carbon</b> <b>cost.</b> Regarding the CO 2 emission substitution potential, the highest potential can be reached at a high <b>carbon</b> <b>cost</b> and low biofuel support. It is concluded that there is a potential conflict of interest between policies promoting increased use of biofuels, and policies aiming at decreased CO 2 emissions...|$|E

An electricity market simulation package (PLEXOS), which uses deterministic linear programming techniques and transmission and generating plant data, is used to optimize the power system and determine the least cost dispatch of generating resources to meet a given demand. We find that wholesale market prices increase due to the full pass through of the increased costs of gas over coal as an input fuel and the Carbon Price.

40|$|Purpose:- The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{identify}} and compare <b>cost</b> and <b>carbon</b> critical elements of two office buildings and to help achieve an optimum balance between building Capital cost (CC) and Embodied Carbon (EC). Design/methodology/approach: - Case study approach was employed to study <b>cost</b> and <b>carbon</b> critical elements of two office buildings as it allows an in-depth and holistic investigation. Elemental estimates of CC and EC were prepared from BoQs of the two buildings by obtaining rates from the UK Building Blackbook. Pareto Principle (80 : 20 rule) was used to identify <b>carbon</b> and <b>cost</b> critical elements of the two buildings and the significance hierarchies of building elements were compared. Findings:- Substructure, Frame and Services were identified as both <b>carbon</b> and <b>cost</b> critical elements responsible for more than 70 % of the total CC and EC in both buildings. Stairs and Ramps, Internal Doors and Fittings, Furnishings and Equipment were identified to be the least <b>carbon</b> and <b>cost</b> significant elements contributing less than 2 % of total CC and EC in both buildings. The hierarchy of <b>cost</b> and <b>carbon</b> significance varies between buildings due to the difference in the specification and design. Originality/value:- The increasing significance of dual currency (<b>cost</b> and <b>carbon)</b> demands <b>cost</b> and <b>carbon</b> management during the early stages of projects. Hence, this paper suggests that focusing on <b>carbon</b> and <b>cost</b> intensive building elements is a way forward to keep both <b>cost</b> and <b>carbon</b> under control during the early stages of projects...|$|R

40|$|A {{low carbon}} fuel {{standard}} (LCFS) seeks to reduce {{greenhouse gas emissions}} by capping an industry’s carbon emissions per unit of output. California has launched an LCFS for automotive fuels; others {{have called for a}} national LCFS. We show that this policy causes production of high-carbon fuels to decrease but production of low-carbon fuels to increase. The net effect of this may be an increase in carbon emissions. The LCFS may also reduce welfare, and the best LCFS may be no LCFS. We simulate the outcomes of a national LCFS, focusing on gasoline and ethanol as the high- and low-carbon fuels. For a broad range of parameters, we find that the LCFS is unlikely to increase CO 2 emissions. However, the surplus losses from the LCFS are quite large ($ 80 to $ 760 billion annually for a national LCFS reducing carbon intensities by 10 percent), and the average <b>carbon</b> <b>cost</b> ($ 307 to $ 2, 272 per ton of CO 2 for the same LCFS) can be much larger than damage estimates.

The carbon intensity in production decreased, which indicated that the agricultural output value per unit of <b>carbon</b> <b>cost</b> gradually increased according to the market demands.
