40|$|Demand for {{high-resolution}} imaging capabilities {{for both}} space-based and ground-based imaging systems has created significant interest {{in improving the}} design of multi-aperture interferometry imaging systems. Interferometers are a desirable alternative to single aperture imaging systems {{due to the fact}} that the angular resolution of a single aperture system is dependent on the diameter of the aperture and the resolution of the image recording device (CCD or otherwise) which quickly results in increased size, weight, and cost. Interferometers can achieve higher angular resolutions with lower resolution recording mediums and smaller apertures by increasing the distance between the apertures. While these systems grow in both size, mechanical, and computational complexity, methods of testing large scale designs with small scale demonstration systems currently do not exist. This paper documents the performance of a small scale multi-aperture intensity <b>correlation</b> <b>interferometer</b> which is used to view a double slit image. The interferometer consists of 2 avalanche photo-diodes connected to a data acquisition computer. The image is produced by shining light through the double slit image an image containment system.

This study presents the formulation of the design parameters for the interferometer, the assembly and design of the interferometer, and then analyzes the results of the imaging experiment and the methods used to attempt to prevent unwanted noise from corrupting the expected interference pattern.

For higher order correlations we develop a stochastic path integral approach and find the generating functions of voltage or occupation number fluctuations. We also derive a generating function for the joint distribution of voltage or occupation number at the probe and current fluctuations at a terminal of a conductor. For energy independent scattering we found earlier that the generating function of current cumulants in interferometers with a one-channel dephasing or voltage probe are identical. Nevertheless, the distribution function for voltage and the distribution function for occupation number fluctuations differ, the latter being broader than that of former in all examples considered here.

As a result, the relaxation of conditional evolution is much faster than the current-sensitive part of dephasing.

The aim of the project is to develop integrated process inspection, cleaning, repair and control systems for nano-scale thin films on large area substrates. The presence of surface irregularities on the uncoated film can induce “defects” within the, aluminium oxide, barrier layer, these features are in the order of magnitude of nanometres to a few microns. These “defects” are examined and quantitatively characterised. The measurements are carried out using a Taylor Hobson Coherence <b>Correlation</b> <b>Interferometer</b> an optical microscope and SEM. The efficient separation of small features from large features is achieved using data segmentation and feature parameter techniques. The presence of both large and small features is then correlated with the water vapour transmission rate as measured on representative sets of films using at standard MOCON (quantitative gas permeation) test. The paper concludes that, based on analysis of water vapour transmission rates (WVTR) and defect size that small numbers of large features have a more significant effect on the deterioration of water vapour transmission rates. It is the WVTR which indicates the potential longevity of the device as it is the effectiveness of this ALD barrier layer to water vapour which ensures the effective function of the core CIGS layers encapsulated in the device.

40|$|A new {{population}} of sources emitting fast and bright transient radio bursts {{has recently been}} identified. The observed large dispersion measure values of FRBs suggests an extragalactic origin and an accurate determination of their positions and distances will provide an unique opportunity to study the magneto-ionic properties of the IGM. So far, FRBs have all been found using large dishes equipped with multi-pixel arrays. While large single dishes are well-suited for the discovery of transient sources they are poor at providing accurate localisations. A 2 D snapshot image of the sky, made with a <b>correlation</b> <b>interferometer</b> array, can provide an accurate localisation of many compact radio sources simultaneously. However, the required time resolution to detect FRBs {{and a desire to}} detect them in real time, makes this currently impractical. In a beamforming approach, where many narrow tied-array beams are produced, the advantages of single dishes and interferometers can be combined. We present a proof-of-concept analysis of a new non-imaging method that utilises the additional spectral and comparative spatial information obtained from multiple overlapping TABs to estimate a transient source location with up to arcsecond accuracy in almost real time. We show that this method can work for a variety of interferometric configurations, including for LOFAR and MeerKAT, and that the estimated angular position may be sufficient to identify a host galaxy without reference to other simultaneous or follow-up observations. With this method, many transient sources can be localised to small fractions of a HPBW of a TAB, in the case of MeerKAT, sufficient to localise a source to arcsecond accuracy. In cases where the position is less accurately determined we can still significantly reduce the area that need be searched for associated emission at other wavelengths and potential host galaxies.

40|$|As {{astronomers and}} astrophysicists seek to view ever-increasingly distant {{celestial}} objects, the desired angular resolution of telescopes is constantly being increased. Classical optics, however, {{has shown a}} proportional relationship between {{the size of an}} optical telescope and the possible angular resolution. Experience has also shown that prohibitive cost accompanies large optical systems. With these limitations on classical optical systems and with the drastic increase in computational power over the past decade, intensity correlation interferometry (ICI) has seen renewed interest since the 1950 ?s and 60 ?s when it was initially conceived by Hanbury Brown and Twiss. Intensity correlation interferometry has the advantage of less stringent equipment precision and less equipment cost when compared to most other forms of interferometry. ICI is thus attractive as a solution to the desire for high angular resolution imaging especially in space based imaging systems. Optical interferometry works by gathering information about the Fourier transform of the geometry of an optical source. An ICI system, however, can only detect the magnitude of the Fourier components. The phase of the Fourier components must be recovered through some computational means and typically some a priori knowledge of the optical source. This thesis gives the physics and mathematical basis of the intensity <b>correlation</b> <b>interferometer.</b> Since the ICI system cannot detect the phase of an optical source's Fourier transform, some known methods for recovering the phase information are discussed. The primary method of interest here is the error-reduction algorithm by Gerchberg-Saxton which was adapted by Fienup to phase retrieval. This algorithm works by using known qualities of the image as constraints; however, sometimes {{it can be difficult to}} know what these constraints are supposed to be. A method of adaptively discovering these constraints is presented, and its performance is evaluated in the presence of noise. Additionally, an algorithm is presented to adapt to the presence of noise in the Fourier modulus data. Finally, the effects of the initial condition of the error-reduction algorithm are shown and a method of mitigating its effect by averaging several independent solutions together is shown...|$|E

40|$|The paper reviews {{progress}} in imaging in radio interferometry {{for the period}} 1993 - 1996. Unlike an optical telescope, the basic measurements of a radio <b>interferometer</b> (<b>correlations</b> between antennas) are indirectly related to a sky brightness image. In a real sense, algorithms and computers are the lenses of a radio interferometer. In the last 20 years, whereas interferometer hardware advances have resulted in improvements of a factor of a few, algorithm and computer advances have resulted in orders of magnitude improvement in image quality. Developing these algorithms has been a fruitful and comparatively inexpensive method of improving the performance of existing telescopes, and has made some newer telescopes possible. In this paper, we review recent developments in the algorithms used in the imaging part of the reduction process. What constitutes an `imaging algorithm'? Whereas {{once there was a}} steady `forward' progression in the reduction process of editing, calibrating, transforming and, finally, deconvolving, this is no longer true. The introduction of techniques such as self-calibration, and algorithms that go directly from visibilities to final images, have made the dividing lines less clear. Although we briefly consider self-calibration, {{for the purposes of this}} paper calibration issues are generally excluded. Most attention will be directed to the steps which form final images from the calibrated visibilities. Comment: 30 pages, 4 figures; ISBN 019856532...|$|R

The first method is a generalized Bayesian analysis, which uses knowledge of the system noise to estimate the differential phase based on a statistical model. The second method utilizes a mechanical accelerometer to reconstruct single-sensor interference fringes based on measurements of the vibration-induced phase. An improved ellipse-fitting algorithm is also implemented as a third method for comparison. These analysis tools are investigated using both numerical simulations and experimental data from simultaneous 87 Rb and 39 K interferometers, and both new techniques are shown to produce bias-free estimates of the differential phase. We also report observations of phase <b>correlations</b> between atom <b>interferometers</b> composed of different chemical species. This correlation enables us to reject common-mode vibration noise {{by a factor of}} 730, and to make preliminary tests of the WEP with a sensitivity of 1. 6 10 6 × − per measurement with an interrogation time of T = 10 ms. We study the level of vibration rejection by varying the temporal overlap between interferometers in a symmetric timing sequence. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the new analysis methods for future applications of differential atom interferometry...|$|R
