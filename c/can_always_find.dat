J is then said to be 'integrable'. If J is induced by a complex structure, then it is induced by a unique complex structure.|$|E

40|$|Compared to {{traditional}} {{statistical machine translation}} (SMT), neural machine translation (NMT) often sacrifices adequacy {{for the sake of}} fluency. We propose a method to combine the advantages of traditional SMT and NMT by exploiting an existing phrase-based SMT model to compute the phrase-based decoding cost for an NMT output and then using this cost to rerank the n-best NMT outputs. The main challenge in implementing this approach is that NMT outputs may not be in the search space of the standard phrase-based decoding algorithm, because the search space of phrase-based SMT is limited by the phrase-based translation rule table. We propose a soft forced decoding algorithm, which <b>can</b> <b>always</b> successfully <b>find</b> a decoding path for any NMT output.

40|$|One of {{the most}} famous results in the theory of random graphs {{establishes}} that the threshold for Hamiltonicity in the Erdos-Renyi random graph G_{n,p} is around p ~ (log n + log log n) / n. Much research has been done to extend this to increasingly challenging random structures. In particular, a recent result by Frieze determined the asymptotic threshold for a loose Hamilton cycle in the random 3 -uniform hypergraph by connecting 3 -uniform hypergraphs to edge-colored graphs. In this work, we consider that setting of edge-colored graphs, and prove a result which achieves the best possible first order constant. Specifically, when the edges of G_{n,p} are randomly colored from a set of (1 + o(1)) n colors, with p = (1 + o(1)) (log n) / n, we show that one <b>can</b> almost <b>always</b> <b>find</b> a Hamilton cycle which has the further property that all edges are distinctly colored (rainbow).

30|$|In the {{simulations}} {{we assume}} that all vehicles are equipped with both WLAN and WiMAX radios. Note that due to the higher bandwidths of WiMAX hops, attachment points, according to (1), tend to select the routes with {{the maximum number of}} WiMAX hops for any given budget. Having observed this, instead of constraining the budget we can alternatively limit the number of WiMAX hops in the routes and obtain the costs for a given maximum allowable number of WiMAX hops in the routes. In our simulation we consider four different routing possibilities: HMTR with WLAN Only where no WiMAX transmission is allowed, HMTR with 1 hopWiMAX in which only one WiMAX transmission is allowed in a route, HMTR with 2 hopWiMAX in which routes are allowed to have up to two WiMAX hops, and HMTR with WiMAX Only. Note that the reason for considering only these four routing possibilities is that the area in our simulation scenario can be covered by at most three consecutive WiMAX hops. Also, based on the given density of vehicles and the transmission ranges of WiMAX radios in our scenarios, every WiMAX radio <b>can</b> almost <b>always</b> <b>find</b> another WiMAX radio in its transmission range.|$|R
