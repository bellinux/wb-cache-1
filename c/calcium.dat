5|$|About {{three-quarters of}} dietary <b>calcium</b> is from dairy {{products}} and grains, the rest being {{accounted for by}} vegetables, protein-rich foods, fruits, sugar, fats, and oil. <b>Calcium</b> supplementation is controversial, as the bioavailability of <b>calcium</b> {{is strongly dependent on}} the solubility of the salt involved: <b>calcium</b> citrate, malate, and lactate are highly bioavailable while the oxalate is much less so. The intestine absorbs about one-third of <b>calcium</b> eaten as the free ion, and plasma <b>calcium</b> level is then regulated by the kidneys. Parathyroid hormone and vitamin D promote the formation of bone by allowing and enhancing the deposition of <b>calcium</b> ions there, allowing rapid bone turnover without affecting bone mass or mineral content. When plasma <b>calcium</b> levels fall, cell surface receptors are activated and the secretion of parathyroid hormone occurs; it then proceeds to stimulate the entry of <b>calcium</b> into the plasma pool by taking it from targeted kidney, gut, and bone cells, with the bone-forming action of parathyroid hormone being antagonised by calcitonin, whose secretion increases with increasing plasma <b>calcium</b> levels.|$|E
5|$|As <b>calcium</b> {{is heavily}} {{involved}} in bone manufacture, many bone diseases {{can be traced to}} problems with the organic matrix or the hydroxyapatite in molecular structure or organisation. For example, osteoporosis is a reduction in mineral content of bone per unit volume, and can be treated by supplementation of <b>calcium,</b> vitamin D, and biphosphates. <b>Calcium</b> supplements may benefit the serum lipids in women who have passed menopause as well as older men; in post-menopausal women <b>calcium</b> supplementation also appears to be inversely correlated with cardiovascular disease. Inadequate amounts of <b>calcium,</b> vitamin D, or phosphates can lead to the softening of bones, known as osteomalacia.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the simple}} oxide CaO, the {{peroxide}} CaO2 {{can be made}} by direct oxidation of <b>calcium</b> metal under a high pressure of oxygen, and there is some evidence for a yellow superoxide Ca(O2)2. <b>Calcium</b> hydroxide, Ca(OH)2, is a strong base, though it is not as strong as the hydroxides of strontium, barium or the alkali metals. All four dihalides of <b>calcium</b> are known. <b>Calcium</b> carbonate (CaCO3) and <b>calcium</b> sulfate (CaSO4) are particularly abundant minerals. Like strontium and barium, as well as the alkali metals and the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium, <b>calcium</b> metal dissolves directly in liquid ammonia to give a dark blue solution.|$|E
5|$|<b>Calcium</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ca and atomic number 20. An alkaline earth metal, <b>calcium</b> is a reactive pale yellow metal that forms a dark oxide-nitride layer {{when exposed to}} air. Its {{physical and chemical properties}} are most similar to its heavier homologues strontium and barium. It is the fifth most abundant element in Earth's crust and the third most abundant metal, after iron and aluminium. The most common <b>calcium</b> compound on Earth is <b>calcium</b> carbonate, found in limestone and the fossilised remnants of early sea life; gypsum, anhydrite, fluorite, and apatite are also sources of <b>calcium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Excess <b>calcium</b> in {{the urine}} (hypercalciuria) occurs due to {{increased}} bone demineralisation with acidosis. Bones {{are mainly composed of}} <b>calcium</b> phosphate. The phosphate reacts with the acid, and the <b>calcium</b> is excreted by the kidneys.|$|E
5|$|Exposure may not {{be evident}} for eight hours for 50% HF, rising to 24 hours for lower concentrations, and a burn may {{initially}} be painless as hydrogen fluoride affects nerve function. If skin has been exposed to HF, damage can be reduced by rinsing it under a jet of water for 10–15 minutes and removing contaminated clothing. <b>Calcium</b> gluconate is often applied next, providing <b>calcium</b> ions to bind with fluoride; skin burns can be treated with 2.5% <b>calcium</b> gluconate gel or special rinsing solutions. Hydrofluoric acid absorption requires further medical treatment; <b>calcium</b> gluconate may be injected or administered intravenously. Using <b>calcium</b> chloride – a common laboratory reagent – in lieu of <b>calcium</b> gluconate is contraindicated, and may lead to severe complications. Excision or amputation of affected parts may be required.|$|E
5|$|In {{groundwater}} strontium behaves chemically {{much like}} <b>calcium.</b> At intermediate to acidic pH Sr2+ {{is the dominant}} strontium species. In the presence of <b>calcium</b> ions, strontium commonly forms coprecipitates with <b>calcium</b> minerals such as calcite and anhydrite at an increased pH. At intermediate to acidic pH, dissolved strontium is bound to soil particles by cation exchange.|$|E
5|$|In {{molecular}} biology, cadmium is used {{to block}} voltage-dependent <b>calcium</b> channels from fluxing <b>calcium</b> ions, {{as well as in}} hypoxia research to stimulate proteasome-dependent degradation of Hif-1α.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} case, acetic acid reacts with the <b>calcium</b> {{carbonate}} (one {{of the main}} components of freshwater, marine and land shells, birds' eggs and other such specimens) producing <b>calcium</b> acetate, a salt. Formaldehyde can be oxidized by the oxygen in air to create formic acid, which then has basically the same effects as acetic acid, reacting with <b>calcium</b> carbonate to produce a salt. The salts (<b>calcium</b> acetate and <b>calcium</b> formate) crystallize through the specimen's outer surface, destroying its fine detail and exposing more areas for further reaction. As the condition progresses, the salt crystals build up over the specimen's surface, which becomes increasingly eroded.|$|E
5|$|In {{this last}} reaction, <b>calcium</b> {{carbonate}} reacts with sulfuric acid and produce <b>calcium</b> sulfate, water and carbon dioxide.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>calcium</b> {{compounds}} {{are used}} in food, as pharmaceuticals, and in medicine, among others. For example, <b>calcium</b> and phosphorus are supplemented in foods through the addition of <b>calcium</b> lactate, <b>calcium</b> diphosphate, and tricalcium phosphate. The last is also used as a polishing agent in toothpaste and in antacids. <b>Calcium</b> lactobionate is a white powder that {{is used as a}} suspending agent for pharmaceuticals. In baking, <b>calcium</b> monophosphate is used as a leavening agent. <b>Calcium</b> sulfite is used as a bleach in papermaking and as a disinfectant, <b>calcium</b> silicate is used as a reinforcing agent in rubber, and <b>calcium</b> acetate is a component of liming rosin and is used to make metallic soaps and synthetic resins.|$|E
5|$|Osteitis fibrosa cystica is {{the result}} of {{unchecked}} hyperparathyroidism, or the overactivity of the parathyroid glands, which results in an overproduction of parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH causes the release of <b>calcium</b> from the bones into the blood, and the reabsorption of <b>calcium</b> in the kidney. Thus, excess PTH in hyperparathyroidism causes elevated blood <b>calcium</b> levels, or hypercalcemia.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of <b>calcium</b> {{is that of}} a typical heavy alkaline earth metal. For example, <b>calcium</b> spontaneously reacts with water more quickly than magnesium and less quickly than strontium to produce <b>calcium</b> hydroxide and hydrogen gas. It also reacts with the oxygen and nitrogen in the air to form a mixture of <b>calcium</b> oxide and <b>calcium</b> nitride. When finely divided, it spontaneously burns in air to produce the nitride. In bulk, <b>calcium</b> is less reactive: it quickly forms a hydration coating in moist air, but below 30% relative humidity it may be stored indefinitely at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|The {{concentrations}} of free <b>calcium</b> {{in the cell}} can regulate an array of reactions and is important for signal transduction in the cell. Mitochondria can transiently store <b>calcium,</b> a contributing process for the cell's homeostasis of <b>calcium.</b>|$|E
5|$|The low {{concentration}} of <b>calcium</b> in the cytosol allows <b>calcium</b> ions {{to function as}} a second messenger in <b>calcium</b> signaling. Here, a signal such as a hormone or an action potential opens <b>calcium</b> channels so that <b>calcium</b> floods into the cytosol. This sudden increase in cytosolic <b>calcium</b> activates other signalling molecules, such as calmodulin and protein kinase C. Other ions such as chloride and potassium may also have signaling functions in the cytosol, but these are not well understood.|$|E
5|$|The major {{producers}} of <b>calcium</b> are China (about 10000 to 12000 tonnes per year), Russia (about 6000 to 8000 tonnes per year), and the United States (about 2000 to 4000 tonnes per year). Canada and France are {{also among the}} minor producers. In 2005, about 24000 tonnes of <b>calcium</b> were produced; {{about half of the}} world's extracted <b>calcium</b> is used by the United States, with about 80% of the output used each year. In Russia and China, Davy's method of electrolysis is still used, but is instead applied to molten <b>calcium</b> chloride. Since <b>calcium</b> is less reactive than strontium or barium, the oxide–nitride coating that results in air is stable and lathe machining and other standard metallurgical techniques are suitable for <b>calcium.</b> In the United States and Canada, <b>calcium</b> is instead produced by reducing lime with aluminium metal at high temperatures.|$|E
5|$|The {{thyroid gland}} also {{produces}} the hormone calcitonin, which helps regulate blood <b>calcium</b> levels. Parafollicular cells produce calcitonin {{in response to}} high blood <b>calcium.</b> Calcitonin decreases the release of <b>calcium</b> from bone, by decreasing the activity of osteoclasts, cells which break down bone. Bone is constantly reabsorbed by osteoclasts and created by osteoblasts, so calcitonin effectively stimulates movement of <b>calcium</b> into bone. The effects of calcitonin are opposite those of the parathyroid hormone (PTH) produced in the parathyroid glands. However, calcitonin seems far less essential than PTH, as <b>calcium</b> metabolism remains clinically normal after removal of the thyroid (thyroidectomy), but not the parathyroid glands.|$|E
5|$|Aluminium {{chloride}} {{reacts with}} <b>calcium</b> and magnesium hydrides in tetrahydrofuran forming tetrahydroaluminates.|$|E
5|$|Another {{function}} of this coenzyme in cell signaling is as a precursor of cyclic ADP-ribose, which is produced from NAD by ADP-ribosyl cyclases, {{as part of}} a second messenger system. This molecule acts in <b>calcium</b> signaling by releasing <b>calcium</b> from intracellular stores. It does this by binding to and opening a class of <b>calcium</b> channels called ryanodine receptors, which are located in the membranes of organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{introduction}} of antivenom, benzodiazepines and intravenous <b>calcium</b> gluconate were used to relieve symptoms of pain and distress, although <b>calcium</b> is not recommended as its benefit has not been shown in clinical trials.|$|E
5|$|<b>Calcium</b> carbimide {{works in}} the same way as disulfiram; it has an {{advantage}} in that the occasional adverse effects of disulfiram, hepatotoxicity and drowsiness, do not occur with <b>calcium</b> carbimide.|$|E
5|$|<b>Calcium</b> ions may be {{complexed}} by proteins through binding the {{carboxyl groups}} of glutamic acid or aspartic acid residues; through interacting with phosphorylated serine, tyrosine, or threonine residues; or by being chelated by γ-carboxylated amino acid residues. Trypsin, a digestive enzyme, uses the first method; osteocalcin, a bone matrix protein, uses the third. Some other bone matrix proteins such as osteopontin and bone sialoprotein use both {{the first and}} the second. Direct activation of enzymes by binding <b>calcium</b> is common; some other enzymes are activated by noncovalent association with direct calcium-binding enzymes. <b>Calcium</b> also binds to the phospholipid layer of the cell membrane, anchoring proteins associated with the cell surface. As an example of the wide range of solubility of <b>calcium</b> compounds, monocalcium phosphate is very soluble in water, 85% of extracellular <b>calcium</b> is as dicalcium phosphate with a solubility of 2.0mM and the hydroxyapatite of bones in an organic matrix is tricalcium phosphate at 100µM.|$|E
5|$|<b>Calcium</b> {{is a very}} ductile silvery metal with a {{pale yellow}} tint whose {{properties}} {{are very similar to}} the heavier elements in its group, strontium, barium, and radium. A <b>calcium</b> atom has twenty electrons, arranged in the electron configuration 4s2. Like the other elements placed in group 2 of the periodic table, <b>calcium</b> has two valence electrons in the outermost s-orbital, which are very easily lost in chemical reactions to form a dipositive ion with the stable electron configuration of a noble gas, in this case argon. Hence, <b>calcium</b> is almost always divalent in its compounds, which are usually ionic. Hypothetical univalent salts of <b>calcium</b> would be stable with respect to their elements, but not to disproportionation to the divalent salts and <b>calcium</b> metal, because the enthalpy of formation of MX2 is much higher than those of the hypothetical MX. This occurs because of the much greater lattice energy afforded by the more highly charged Ca2+ cation compared to the hypothetical Ca+ cation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Calcium</b> is an {{essential}} element needed in large quantities. The Ca2+ ion acts as an electrolyte and {{is vital to the}} health of the muscular, circulatory, and digestive systems; is indispensable to the building of bone; and supports synthesis and function of blood cells. For example, it regulates the contraction of muscles, nerve conduction, and the clotting of blood. As a result, intra- and extracellular <b>calcium</b> levels are tightly regulated by the body. <b>Calcium</b> can play this role because the Ca2+ ion forms stable coordination complexes with many organic compounds, especially proteins; it also forms compounds with a wide range of solubilities, enabling the formation of skeletons.|$|E
5|$|<b>Calcium</b> is {{the fifth}} most {{abundant}} element {{in the human body}} and the most abundant metal. <b>Calcium</b> ions {{play a vital role in}} the physiology and biochemistry of organisms and the cell as electrolytes. They play an important role in signal transduction pathways, where they act as a second messenger, in neurotransmitter release from neurons, in contraction of all muscle cell types, and in fertilization. Many enzymes require <b>calcium</b> ions as a cofactor. <b>Calcium</b> ions outside cells are also important for maintaining the potential difference across excitable cell membranes, as well as proper bone formation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Calcium</b> oxalate is {{a common}} {{crystalline}} compound found in many fungi, including the earthstars. The presence of <b>calcium</b> oxalate crystals—apparent as a whitish powder {{on the surface of}} the spore sac—has been verified for G.pectinatum using scanning electron microscopy. The <b>calcium</b> oxalate crystals occur in the tetragonal form, known as weddellite. A study on the related species Geastrum saccatum has shown that these crystals are responsible for the characteristic opening (dehiscence) of the outer peridial layers. The formation of <b>calcium</b> oxalate crystals stretches the layers of the outer walls, pushing apart the inner and outer layers of the peridium.|$|E
5|$|<b>Calcium,</b> {{along with}} its {{congeners}} magnesium, strontium, and barium, was first isolated by Humphry Davy in 1808. Following the work of Jöns Jakob Berzelius and Magnus Martin af Pontin on electrolysis, Davy isolated <b>calcium</b> and magnesium by putting a mixture of the respective metal oxides with mercury(II) oxide on a platinum plate which {{was used as the}} anode, the cathode being a platinum wire partially submerged into mercury. Electrolysis then gave calcium–mercury and magnesium–mercury amalgams, and distilling off the mercury gave the metal. However, pure <b>calcium</b> cannot be prepared in bulk by this method and a workable commercial process for its production was not found until over a century later.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{compounds}} {{can bind to}} troponin C to act as troponin activators (<b>calcium</b> sensitizers) or troponin inhibitors (<b>calcium</b> desensitizers). There {{are already}} multiple troponin activators that bind to fast skeletal troponin C, of which tirasemtiv has been tested in multiple clinical trials. In contrast, there are no known compounds that bind with high affinity to cardiac troponin C. The <b>calcium</b> sensitizer, levosimendan, is purported to bind to troponin C, but only weak or inconsistent binding has been detected, precluding any structure determination. In contrast, levosimendan inhibits type 3 phosphodiesterase with nanomolar affinity, so its biological target is controversial.|$|E
5|$|Coral Calx, {{known as}} Praval Bhasma in Sanskrit, {{is widely used}} in {{traditional}} system of Indian medicine as a supplement {{in the treatment of}} a variety of bone metabolic disorders associated with <b>calcium</b> deficiency. In classical times ingestion of pulverized coral, which consists mainly of the weak base <b>calcium</b> carbonate, was recommended for calming stomach ulcers by Galen and Dioscorides.|$|E
5|$|Cryptothecia rubrocincta {{is easily}} {{recognized}} by the bright red pigment in the thallus. The pigment, first isolated from the species by Hesse in 1904, is called chiodectonic acid. The lichen also contains the colorless depside compound confluentinic acid. A 2005 study employed the technique Raman spectroscopy to determine the chemical composition of the differently colored zones. The white crystalline zone contains <b>calcium</b> oxalate dihydrate, or weddellite, a chemical substance found in other lichens and extremophiles growing on calcium-rich surfaces. Some {{have suggested that the}} <b>calcium</b> oxalate serves in the organism's survival strategy: the storage of water as a crystalline hydrate is essential for periods of drought in desiccated environments, and <b>calcium</b> oxalate has been identified as dissuading herbivores. Because the lichen grows on calcium-poor surfaces, <b>calcium</b> ions are thought to be acquired from rain, bird droppings, and airborne particles.|$|E
5|$|Dysprosium {{is used in}} {{dosimeters}} {{for measuring}} ionizing radiation. Crystals of <b>calcium</b> sulfate or <b>calcium</b> fluoride are doped with dysprosium. When these crystals are exposed to radiation, the dysprosium atoms become excited and luminescent. The luminescence can be measured to determine the degree of exposure to which the dosimeter has been subjected.|$|E
5|$|Excess {{intake of}} <b>calcium</b> may cause hypercalcaemia, {{but because of}} the inefficient {{absorption}} of <b>calcium</b> by the intestines a more likely cause is excessive vitamin D intake or excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone. It can also occur due to the bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasise to bone. This results in deposition of <b>calcium</b> salts into the heart, the blood vessels, and the kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia may lead to soft tissue calcification, which can lead to serious consequences: for example, calcification of the vascular wall can lead to a loss of elasticity and the disruption of laminar blood flow, and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Likewise, inadequate <b>calcium</b> or vitamin D intake results in hypocalcaemia, often caused by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective receptors to it in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, potentially causing tetany and defects in cardiac conduction.|$|E
5|$|High {{potassium}} levels {{tend to be}} {{a feature}} of severe rhabdomyolysis. Electrocardiography (ECG) may show whether the elevated potassium levels are affecting the conduction system of the heart, as suggested by the presence of T wave changes or broadening of the QRS complex. Low <b>calcium</b> levels may be present in the initial stage due to binding of free <b>calcium</b> to damaged muscle cells.|$|E
5|$|Kidneys: renal tubular {{acidosis}} (Type 2), {{a disorder}} of bicarbonate handling by the proximal tubules leads to nephrocalcinosis (<b>calcium</b> accumulation in the kidneys), a weakening of bones (due to <b>calcium</b> and phosphate loss), and occasionally aminoaciduria (loss of essential amino acids needed for protein synthesis).|$|E
5|$|Legumes such as clover or alfalfa {{are usually}} higher in protein, <b>calcium,</b> and energy than grasses. However, they require warm weather and good soil {{to produce the}} best nutrients. Legume hays are {{generally}} higher in protein than the grass hays. They are also higher in minerals, particularly <b>calcium,</b> but have an incorrect ratio of <b>calcium</b> to phosphorus. Because they are high in protein, they are very desirable for growing horses or those subjected to very hard work, but the calcium:phosphorus ratio must be balanced by other feeds to prevent bone abnormalities.|$|E
5|$|Like other elements, {{a variety}} of {{processes}} alter the relative abundance of <b>calcium</b> isotopes. The best studied of these processes is the mass-dependent fractionation of <b>calcium</b> isotopes that accompanies the precipitation of <b>calcium</b> minerals such as calcite, aragonite and apatite from solution. Lighter isotopes are preferentially incorporated into these minerals, leaving the surrounding solution enriched in heavier isotopes at a magnitude of roughly 0.025% per atomic mass unit (amu) at room temperature. Mass-dependent differences in <b>calcium</b> isotope composition are conventionally expressed by the ratio of two isotopes (usually 44Ca/40Ca) in a sample compared to the same ratio in a standard reference material. 44Ca/40Ca varies by about 1% among common earth materials.|$|E
