40|$|The color {{represents}} an important parameter of wine quality. This characterizes sort, type, composition {{and age of}} wine. Unlike white wines, the red wine color {{is determined by the}} presence of some specific substances – anthocyanic pigments. A big importance on the color of red wine presents tenant substances, acidity, metals, reductive substances. The color of wine is affected by several factors, among the more important being grape variety, pH, temperature, oenological treatments and aging. Research has been made on four red wines from Albanian native grape varieties (Serin i zi, Debin e zeze, Shesh i zi, Kallmet) and two red wines from international grape varieties Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, grown in Albania. Chromatic characteristics of wines were determined by Spectrophotometric method. For this purpose, the following indicators were measured: the intensity of color, <b>color</b> <b>tint</b> of wine, the percentage of red, yellow and blue color and defined variables X, Y, Z, using the CIE system (Commission Internationale de l'ECLAIRAGE) ...|$|E
40|$|Spectacle lenses {{are made}} of mineral or organic (plastic) materials. Various {{coatings}} and tints are applied to the spectacle lenses according to the characteristic of the lens material, and for the personal needs and cosmetic purpose. The coatings may be classified in seven groups: 1) Anti-reflection coatings, 2) Hard coatings, 3) Clean coat, 4) Mirror coatings, 5) <b>Color</b> <b>tint</b> coating (one of coloring processes), 6) Photochromic coating (one of photochromic processes), and 7) Anti-fog coatings. Anti-reflection coatings reduce unwanted reflections from the lens surfaces and increase light transmission. Hard coatings are applied for preventing the plastic lens surface from scratches and abrasion. Hard coatings are not required for the mineral lenses due to their hardness. Clean coat makes the lens surface smooth and hydrophobic. Thus, it prevents the adherence of dust, tarnish, and dirt particles on the lens surface. Mirror coatings are applied onto the sunglasses for cosmetic purpose. Color tinted and photochromic lenses are used for sun protection and absorption of the harmful UV radiations. Anti-fog coatings make the lens surface hydrophilic and prevent the coalescence of tiny water droplets on the lens surface that reduces light transmission.

40|$|International audienceFood {{sources of}} the European abalone Haliotis tuberculata {{throughout}} its life cycle are still to be clarified in nature. A novel non-destructive method of digital shell color analysis to reveal the diets of European abalone (ormer) was developed in this study. The method was calibrated using ormers reared under experimental conditions in North Western Brittany in 2012 and fed a controlled monospecific diet to define the shell hues associated with various macroalgae (i. e., Rhodophyta, Chlorophyta, and Phaeophyta). General food preferences were established by comparing the shell hue of wild adult ormers and experimental adult ormers. Shell hue corresponds to the <b>color</b> <b>tint</b> in the HSL color space measured on digital pictures of the shell. Experimentally, shell hue values differed according to treatment, with the most yellow-green hue (72 °) for ormers fed Saccharina sp. and the coral hue (25 °) for ormers fed Palmaria palmata. High variation in shell color of wild ormers was observed according to the sampling site and/or ontogeny. The diet of wild ormers {{may be related to}} the abundance of different drifting algae in their respective habitats. Thus, this non-destructive and easy-to-use technique appears to be a promising tool for determining the diet of Haliotis species and, perhaps, other herbivorous mollusks...|$|E

40|$|Keeping of {{red wine}} in bottles is very {{important}} for its maturation and quality. However, there are numerous changes that happen during that period, usually caused by oxidative processes and changes in structure and content of polyphenolic compounds. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine the effects of Inactivated dry yeast (IDY) products on aging, phenolics content, colour stability and sensory characteristics {{of red wine}} Prokupac (Serbian autochthonous variety). The treatment of wine was done by 3 different IDYP (Lallemand, Canada) : Optimum White, Opti Less and Noblesse, applied as 0. 2 [*]g/L and 0. 4 [*]g /L during 15 days. Subsequently, wine clarification was done, followed by filtration and bottling. Untreated wines were used for comparison. Wine was subjected to accelerated aging (10 days at 55 						° 					C) and also to normal aging conditions during one year. To determine the influence of IDYP following parameters were monitored: dissolved O 2, free and total SO 2, sugar free extract, content of total phenolics, flavonoids, flavan- 3 -ols and anthocyanins, percent of polymeric color, <b>color</b> <b>tint,</b> color intensity and sensory characteristics (Panel method).

40|$|To {{determine}} the effects of grape skin and seed pomace (GSP) additions on the lipid oxidation susceptibility and the color change of cooked pork sausages, the chemical characteristics of GSP itself and the addition for two different levels of GSP (0. 5 and 1. 0 % GSP, respectively) to sausages were examined. Both the redness and blueness of the GSP were significantly reduced as the pH level was increased from 5 to 7, but a reverse result was determined in the <b>color</b> <b>tint</b> and yellowness (p< 0. 05). The GSP polyphenol and flavonoid contents were influenced by the percentages of methanol solvents, and more flavonoids were established when 100 % of methanol was applied as a solvent to the GSP. But, similar results were not observed in the polyphenol of GSP. In cooked pork sausages, significant decreases in the lightness and redness were found in both the 0. 5 % and 1. 0 % of GSP sausages during the storage period (p< 0. 05). However, an incompatible effect was observed in terms of yellowness, which increased as compared to the control sausage after 6 days of storage. The 0. 5 % addition of GSP decreased the levels of TBARS (p< 0. 05), but the ability of GSP to minimize lipid oxidation was not dose dependent. Therefore, the results indicated that the GSP is an efficient suppressor of lipid oxidation and has latent effects as a natural antioxidant when 0. 5 % of GSP is added to the cooked pork sausages.

40|$|Electrochromic {{properties}} of sputter-deposited nickel-based oxide films {{have been studied}} with a two-fold goal. From a practical point of view, the optical switching performance has been improved by optimizing the deposition conditions and film stoichiometry with respect to oxygen and hydrogen, and further by adding Mg, Al, Si, Zr, Nb or Ta to the films. From a theoretical point of view, details of the coloration mechanism have been studied by means of electrochemical intercalation (CV, GITT), optical measurements (UV, VIS, NIR and MIR), RBS, XRD, XPS and EXAFS. Optimization of deposition conditions has been illustrated by the example of films made by sputtering of a non-magnetic Ni(93) V(7) % wt. target {{in an atmosphere of}} Ar/O 2 /H 2. The optimized films exhibit transmittance modulation between 20 % and 75 % at 18 mC/cm 2 charge intercalation. The remaining problem with nickel oxide and nickel vanadium oxide films is their residual yellow-brown <b>color</b> <b>tint</b> in the bleached state, which disappears as the short-wavelength transmittance increases upon addition of Mg, Al, Zr or Ta. Optimization of deposition conditions by co-sputtering from two targets and the film composition for mixed oxide films has been illustrated by the example of nickel aluminium oxide. The mechanisms of coloration upon electrochemical charge insertion and ozone exposure have been investigated. In the beginning of the electrochemical cycling, first, a reconstruction and crystallization is observed with the outer most part of the grain surface being transformed from oxygen rich nickel oxide into nickel oxy-hydroxide and hydroxide by transfer of H+ and OH- groups. After the charge capacity has been stabilized, only a transfer of H+ occurs with two reversible reactions involved: the first one from Ni(OH) 2 to NiOOH and the second one from NiO and Ni(OH) 2 to Ni 2 O 3. Ozone coloration is described by a similar reaction scheme. The ozone molecule is split on the surface and dehydrogenates Ni(OH) 2 into NiOOH. Further dehydrogenation produces Ni 2 O 3 as in the electrochemical coloration...|$|E
