5000|$|The {{financial}} {{condition of the}} Social Security and Medicare programs remains challenging. Projected long run program costs are not sustainable under current program parameters. Social Security's annual surpluses of tax income over expenditures are expected to fall sharply this year and to stay about constant in 2010 {{because of the economic}} recession, and to rise only briefly before declining and turning to <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>deficits</b> beginning in 2016 that grow as the baby boom generation retires. The deficits will be made up by redeeming trust fund assets until reserves are exhausted in 2037, at which point tax income would be sufficient to pay about three fourths of scheduled benefits through 2083. Medicare's financial status is much worse. As was true in 2008, Medicare's Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund is expected to pay out more in hospital benefits and other expenditures this year than it receives in taxes and other dedicated revenues. The difference will be made up by redeeming trust fund assets. Growing annual deficits are projected to exhaust HI reserves in 2017, after which the percentage of scheduled benefits payable from tax income would decline from 81 percent in 2017 to about 50 percent in 2035 and 30 percent in 2080. In addition, the Medicare Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) Trust Fund that pays for physician services and the prescription drug benefit will continue to require general revenue financing and charges on beneficiaries that grow substantially faster than the economy and beneficiary incomes over time.|$|E

Farm financial performance following implementation of manure management is simulated by farm size (60 cows, 150 cows, and 350 cows) over a ten-year time horizon using the Farm Level Income and Policy Simulation Modeling System (FLIPSim).

Study findings indicated that there are several factors influencing the performance of SME;these include financial support, cash management, technology used and management capability and skills. The study recommends that SMEs in Zanzibar should strongly focus on looking for financial entities to have customer satisfaction by providing high quality and affordable products and services.

40|$|Farm {{income for}} many wheat, feed grain, cotton and rice farmers {{across the country}} has {{declined}} since {{the passage of the}} 1996 farm bill. Lower farm incomes have been a result of lower commodity prices and in many locations low yields due to adverse weather. The absence of a counter cyclical safety net program (such as deficiency payments) in the 1996 farm bill has allowed farm incomes to decline as prices weakened. Concern over low incomes has caused the Congress to approve an emergency assistance {{in each of the last}} three years (USDA, 1998, 1999 and 2000). Despite the emergency assistance bills to help raise farm incomes, many commercial farmers in the South continue to experience cash flow problems (Smith and Richardson). FAPRI’s January 2000 Baseline projected slow price recovery over the next five years due to low demand growth relative to supply. In the absence of policy changes providing additional assistance, the outlook for representative farms in the South is for high probabilities of <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>deficits</b> over the next five years (Adams and Richardson). As Congress begins its debate for the 2002 farm bill, there have been calls for a counter cyclical safety net that will provide a better basis for targeting longer term planning than exists with ad hoc emergency assistance.

40|$|On March 17, 2003, the {{trustees}} of the Social Security program released their annual report on the system's financial status. Many observers took the report's extension of the trust fund's solvency one year to 2042 to mean that Social Security's financial health had improved. In fact, Social Security's actuarial balance declined and its <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>deficits</b> over the next 75 years increased to $ 25. 33 trillion (in 2003 dollars). More important, the report contained significant new methodologies that {{are central to the}} debate over personal retirement accounts. The trustees now measure Social Security's deficits over the infinite horizon, providing remedies to the previous 75 -year scoring window that substantially understates the costs of the current program and overstates the costs of personal account plans. Under this new perpetuity benchmark, the present value of Social Security's cash flow shortfalls totals $ 11. 9 trillion, versus only $ 4. 9 trillion over 75 years. To cover Social Security's cash deficits permanently would demand an immediate tax increase equal to 4. 47 percent of payroll. The 2003 report also includes a "stochastic analysis" accounting for the variability of the economic and demographic factors affecting Social Security's finances, finding there is less than a 1 -in- 40 chance of Social Security remaining solvent for even 75 years without reform. The 2003 Trustees Report shows that Social Security's cash deficits are large, growing, and unlikely to fix themselves without action.

The analysis was conducted over the 2001 - 2007 planning horizon using FLIPSIM, AFPC’s whole farm simulation model. Data to simulate farming operations in Texas’ major cotton production regions came from two sources: - Producer panel cooperation to develop economic information to describe and simulate representative cotton farms. - Projected prices, policy variables, and input inflation rates from the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute (FAPRI) August 2003 Baseline. The primary objective of the analysis {{is to determine the}} farms’ economic viability by region through the life of the 2002 Farm Bill. The FLIPSIM policy simulation model incorporates the historical risk faced by cotton farmers for both prices and production. This report presents the results of the August 2003 Baseline in a risk context using selected simulated probabilities and ranges for annual net cash farm income values. The probability of a farm experiencing annual <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>deficits</b> and the probability of a farm losing real net worth are included as indicators of the cash flow and equity risks facing farms through the year 2007. This report is organized into six sections. The first section summarizes the process used to develop the representative farms and the key assumptions utilized for the farm level analysis. The second section summarizes the FAPRI August 2003 Baseline and the policy and price assumptions used for the representative farm analyses.

Previous research conducted in the United States has provided inconsistency in the results of investigating accounting data, <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> and accrual accounting data in predicting future <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> No published research has studied <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> prediction in Thailand. The current study investigates the ability of accrual and <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> accounting data to predict future <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> of Thai listed companies. Three regression models are constructed namely earnings, <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> accrual components and <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> models. In addition, <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> ratios are investigated to predict future <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> by using a stepwise regression. Data used in this study is collected from the financial statements of non-financial companies listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand from 1994 to 2002. <b>Cash</b> <b>flow</b> data are selected directly from the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> statements. The empirical results show that past earnings, <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> and accrual component of earnings can be used to predict future <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> of Thai listed companies and <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> have better predictive power than past earnings. Additionally, the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model and the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> and accrual components of earnings model have better predictive power than the earnings model.
