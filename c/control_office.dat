5|$|Each passing loop is {{controlled}} by a small signal box, known as a block-post. These house the lever frames that control the points, the token equipment and telephones. The railway has few signals; instead it has stop boards at Pendre, Brynglas, Quarry Siding and Nant Gwernol, and the blockman allows trains to proceed by use of flags. There are colour light signals located at Tywyn Wharf, operated from the <b>Control</b> <b>Office</b> and disc signals controlled from the ground frame. Abergynolwyn has colour light signals, which are operated from the blockpost. When the block-post is unmanned, {{it is the responsibility}} of the locomotive crew to change the token before proceeding.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} Plimmerton to Paekakariki duplication, {{rather than}} install signal boxes at North and South junctions, as had been {{previous}} practice, a three-wire remote control system was installed so that the signalling of trains at the junctions could be directly controlled from the Train <b>Control</b> <b>office</b> in Wellington. This was the first Centralised Train Control (CTC) system to be installed in New Zealand and the first outside the United States of America.|$|E
25|$|Fritz Beblo {{began as}} a city {{building}} inspector in Strasbourg, which had belonged {{to the state of}} Elsass-Lothringen (Alsace-Lorraine) in the German Empire since 1871. At the beginning of the 20th century, Strasbourg was also {{in the midst of a}} lot of building activity (the Neustadt). In 1910, Fritz Beblo was named head of the building department and building <b>control</b> <b>office</b> (Baurat, building officer). He received support for his plans from Rudolf Schwander, the mayor. Beblo's name is especially connected with the Musau-Schule (1904–1906), the Thomasschule (1905–1907), the Neufeldschule (1907–1909, today the Collège Louise Weiss), the Haushaltsschule beside the Magdalenenkirche (1909–1910), the Magdalenenkirche, the Grande Percée (Neue Straße) and the swimming pool and thermal baths Bains Municipaux (1905–1910). This art nouveau style bath is considered one of his finest works and is protected as a historical monument. The last work of Beblo in Strasbourg that is worth mentioning is the grounds of the Nordfriedhof (Northern Cemetery). He was not able to complete this work, having to leave the city of Strasbourg after the end of the First World War, since he was a German official and the city had become French again.|$|E

2500|$|While {{still under}} {{construction}} in September 1972, a group of local developers responsible for the neighboring Juneau Square development filed suit against First Wisconsin. The $138 million suit alleged the bank acted in a [...] "monopolistic" [...] manner to <b>control</b> <b>office</b> development, {{in an effort to}} derail the plaintiffs proposed 25-story office tower project on a property adjacent to the First Wisconsin Center. After several years of litigation, the suit finally went to trial in May 1976. The following October, the court found First Wisconsin guilty and awarded the plaintiffs $6 million in damages that was then tripled to $18 million due to federal laws on damages awarded to antitrust suits. First Wisconsin appealed the ruling, and in August 1977, a federal court ruled the case be retried due to the complexity of the original trial, along with the plaintiffs being allowed more time and the admission of hearsay testimony. Upon appeal, in June 1978 the court ruled in favor of First Wisconsin in clearing the company of all charges.|$|E
2500|$|Once {{the legal}} {{exclusion}} of Jews from Hungarian society was complete, the National Central Alien <b>Control</b> <b>Office</b> (Külföldieket Ellenőrző Országos Központi Hatóság, KEOKH), turned its attention {{almost exclusively to}} expelling “undesirable” Jews. By the summer of 1941, the Hungarians carried out their first series of mass murders, and again in early January 1942 when they slaughtered 2,500 Serbs and 700 Jews, demonstrating that the political leadership in Hungary authorized the commission of atrocities even before the German occupation. Sometime in August 1941, the Hungarian authorities deported 16,000 [...] "alien" [...] Jews, {{most of whom were}} shot by the SS and Ukrainian collaborators. In the spring of 1942, the Hungarian Minister of Defense ordered the majority of Jewish forced labor to the theater of military operations. Due to this order as many as 50,000 Jews worked in forced labor companies starting in the spring of 1942 through 1944. Accompanying Hungarian troops during Operation Barbarossa, Jews in these units were poorly treated, insufficiently housed, [...] ill-fed, routinely used to clear minefields, and placed in constant unnecessary danger; estimates indicate that “at least 33,000 Hungarian Jewish males in the prime of life” died in Russia.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background To {{determine}} whether education and financial incentives increased dentists' delivery of fluoride varnish and sealants to at risk children covered by capitation dental insurance in Washington state (U. S.). Methods In 1999, 53 dental offices in Washington Dental Service's capitation dental plan {{were invited to}} participate in the study, and consenting offices were randomized to intervention (n = 9) and control (n = 10) groups. Offices recruited 689 capitation children aged 6 – 14 and at risk for caries, who were followed for 2 years. Intervention offices received provider education and fee-for-service reimbursement for delivering fluoride varnish and sealants. Insurance records were used to calculate office service rates for fluoride, sealants, and restorations. Parents completed mail surveys after follow-up to measure their children's dental utilization, dental satisfaction, dental fear and oral health status. Regression models estimated differences in service rates between intervention and <b>control</b> <b>offices,</b> and compared survey measures between groups. Results Nineteen offices (34 %) consented to participate in the study. Fluoride and sealant rates were greater in the intervention <b>offices</b> than the <b>control</b> <b>offices,</b> but the differences were not statistically significant. Restoration rates were lower in the intervention <b>offices</b> than the <b>control</b> <b>offices.</b> Parents in the intervention group reported their children had less dental fear than control group parents. Conclusion Due to low dentist participation the study lacked power to detect an intervention effect on dentists' delivery of caries-control services. The intervention may have reduced children's dental fear. </p...|$|R
