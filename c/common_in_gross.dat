40|$|SUMMARY Of 91 {{children}} with idiopathic persistent or recurrent haematuria, eight also had hyper-calciuria. This was transient in three and persistent in five. Persistent hypercalciuria {{was a rare}} cause of microscopic haematuria (two of 80), but <b>common</b> <b>in</b> association with <b>gross</b> haematuria (three of 11). Hypercalciuria has been reported as causing haema-turia, both <b>gross</b> and microscopic, <b>in</b> the absence of diagnosable calculi. 1 - 5 Stapleton et a 15 described 23 cases of hypercalciuria in 83 children being investi-gated for idiopathic haematuria (microscopic and macroscopic) over a two year period. In 23 children a renal or urological cause was found; 22 of the remaining 60 children had hypercalciuria. Of 37 {{children with}} gross haematuria, 16 had hyper...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} if the measured beta activity for a solution containing potassium was exactly as predicted, particularly since the CES gas counter is not calibrated specifically with K- 40, an experiment was conducted to compare measured activities from two radioanalytical methods (gamma spectroscopy and gas proportional counting) to calculated activities across a range of potassium concentrations. Potassium, being ubiquitous and naturally radioactive, is a well-known and <b>common</b> interference <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> beta counting methods. By measuring the observed beta activity due to K- 40 in potassium-containing solutions across a wide range of concentrations, {{it was found that the}} observed beta activity agrees well with the beta activity calculated from the potassium concentration measured by standard inorganic analytical techniques, such as ICP-OES, and that using the measured potassium concentration to calculate the expected beta activity, and comparing this to the observed beta activity to determine if potassium can account for all the observed activity in a sample, is a valid technique. It was also observed that gamma spectroscopy is not an effective means of measuring K- 40 activity below approximately 700 pCi/L, which corresponds to a solution with approximately 833 mg/L total potassium. Gas proportional counting for gross beta activity has a much lower detection limit, typically 20 - 50 picoCi/L for a liquid low in total dissolved solids, which corresponds to a potassium concentration of approximately 30 - 70 ppm K...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Ecosystem {{models are}} useful tools for {{evaluating}} environmental controls on carbon and water cycles under past or future conditions. In this paper we compare annual carbon and water fluxes from nine boreal spruce forest ecosystem models {{in a series}} of sensitivity simulations. For each comparison, a single climate driver or forest site parameter was altered in a separate sensitivity run. Driver and parameter changes were prescribed principally to be large enough to identify and isolate any major differences in model responses, while also remaining within the range of variability that the boreal forest biome may be exposed to over a time period of several decades. The models simulated plant production, autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration, and evapotranspiration (ET) for a black spruce site in the boreal forest of central Canada (56 o N). Results revealed that there were <b>common</b> model responses <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> primary production, plant respiration, and ET fluxes to prescribed changes in air temperature or surface irradiance and to decreased precipitation amounts. The models were also similar in their responses to variations in canopy leaf area, leaf nitrogen content, and surface organic layer thickness. The models had different sensitivities to certain parameters, namely the net primary production response to increased CO 2 levels, and the response of soil microbial respiration t...|$|R

We find that the decline <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> job flows can be described as a narrowing of the distribution of employer growth rates, but this change in the distribution of gross job flows only explains {{about a third of the}} decline <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> worker flows. This implies that whatever economic forces are driving the declines <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> job flows, there are different forces that are driving the declines <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> worker flows. Analyzing the relationship between gross worker flows and job-to-job flows, we find that declines in both short-duration jobs and job-to-job flows are driving the declines <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> worker flows.|$|R
