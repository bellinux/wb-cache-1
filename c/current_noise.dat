25|$|One {{advantage}} of the FET is its high gate to main current resistance, {{on the order of}} 100 MΩ or more, thus providing a high degree of isolation between control and flow. Because base <b>current</b> <b>noise</b> will increase with shaping time, a FET typically produces less noise than a bipolar junction transistor (BJT), and is thus found in noise sensitive electronics such as tuners and low-noise amplifiers for VHF and satellite receivers. It is relatively immune to radiation. It exhibits no offset voltage at zero drain current and hence makes an excellent signal chopper. It typically has better thermal stability than a BJT. Because they are controlled by gate charge, once the gate is closed or opened, there is no additional power draw, as there would be with a bipolar junction transistor or with non-latching relays in some states. This allows extremely low-power switching, which in turn allows greater miniaturization of circuits because heat dissipation needs are reduced compared to other types of switches.|$|E

As the proposed dynamic state equation [...] provides no physical mechanism enabling such a memristor to cope with inevitable thermal fluctuations, a current-controlled memristor would erratically change its state in course of time just under the influence of <b>current</b> <b>noise.</b> Di Ventra and Pershin thus concluded that memristors whose resistance (memory) states depend solely on the current or voltage history would be unable to protect their memory states against unavoidable Johnson–Nyquist noise and permanently suffer from information loss, a so-called [...] "stochastic catastrophe". A current-controlled memristor can thus not exist as a solid state device in physical reality.|$|E

For a given generating functional, we derive exact expressions for tunneling <b>currents</b> and <b>noises</b> and present the forms in terms of transport coefficients. It is also shown that in the adiabatic limit our results encompass previous formulas. In order to reveal effects missing in static cases, we apply the derived results to simulate realized radio-frequency single-electron transistor.

The standard deviation of the threshold voltage variation depends on the absolute size of the devices, the minimum feature size of the manufacturing process, and the body voltage and is typically 1 to 3 millivolts. Therefore to keep the contribution of the threshold voltage term in equation (9) to a percent or less requires biasing the transistors with the gate-source voltage exceeding the threshold by several tenths of a volt.
