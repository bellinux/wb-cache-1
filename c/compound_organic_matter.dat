Several studies illustrate that sorption of non-ionic hydrophobic <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> decreases with increasing polarity of the soil <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> Other factors that affect sorption are the aromaticity and the 'open' structure of the material.

This is feasible by relating sorption coefficients to both organic oxygen and organic carbon content.

40|$|International audienceChondrites accreted {{the oldest}} solid {{materials}} {{in the solar system}} including dust processed in the protoplanetary disk and diverse <b>organic</b> <b>compounds.</b> After accretion, asteroidal alteration may have impacted organic particles in various ways. To constrain these processes, we conducted a comprehensive study of organics disseminated within the matrices of the three carbonaceous chondrite falls, Renazzo (CR 2), Murchison (CM 2) and Orgueil (CI). By combining synchrotron-based STXM and TEM analyses on FIB sections of samples previously characterized by NanoSIMS, we investigated the influence of aqueous alteration on the morphology, isotopic signature, molecular structure, spatial distribution, and mineralogical environment of the <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> within the matrices. Two different populations of materials are distinguishable: sub-micrometric individual grains, likely dominated by insoluble <b>compounds</b> and diffuse <b>organic</b> <b>matter,</b> finely interspersed within phyllosilicates and/or (amorphous) nanocarbonates at the nanometer scale. We suggest that this latter component, which is depleted in aromatics and enriched in carboxylic functional groups, may be dominated by soluble <b>compounds.</b> <b>Organic</b> <b>matter</b> in Renazzo (CR) mainly consists of chemically-homogeneous individual grains surrounded by amorphous and nanocrystalline phyllosilicates. Evidence of connectivity between organic grains and fractures indicates that redistribution has occurred: some areas containing diffuse <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> can be observed. This diffuse organic component is more abundant in Murchison (CM) and Orgueil (CI). This is interpreted as resulting from fluid transport at the micrometer scale and encapsulation within recrystallized alteration phases. In contrast to Renazzo, organic grains in Murchison and Orgueil display strong chemical heterogeneities, likely related to chemical evolution during aqueous alteration. The observations suggest that the altering fluid was a brine with elevated concentrations of both organic and inorganic soluble components. Ultimately, when water was consumed by aqueous alteration reactions or lost from the system, soluble <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> accumulated in the immediate vicinity of the precipitated carbonates and phosphates. Additionally, the nanometer scale organic/phyllosilicate relationships provide a petrological environment where some of the initially accreted <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> could have been modified through clay-mediated reactions...|$|R

After demineralization with HF, perhaps as much as 30 % of the total carbon in Murray may be extractable with CH_ 3 OH. The extracts from Renazzo have isotopic ratios which suggest that they are mainly terrestrial <b>organic</b> <b>matter,</b> with lesser contributions from indigenous organics. The CH_ 3 OH-soluble <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> from Murchison and both untreated and HF-treated Murray has δ^(13) C values of about + 5 to + 10 %. and δ^(15) N values of about + 90 to + 100 %., both of which are significantly higher than the bulk meteorite values. The Orgueil CH_ 3 OH-extract also has a δ^(15) N value well above the value in residual <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> Values for δD of + 300 to + 500 %. are found for the CH_ 3 OH-soluble <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> The combined data for C, H and N isotopes makes it highly unlikely that the CH_ 3 OH-soluble components are derivable from, or simply related to, the insoluble organic polymer found in the same meteorites.

A gravimetric experimental method and a computer simulation method were used to study the sorption-desorption of organic contaminants in humic substances. The average apparent diffusivities of trichloroethylene (TCE) in soil humic acid are 1. 1 x 10 (- 8) cm(2) /s for sorption and 3. 0 x 10 (- 9) cm(2) /s for desorption.

The paper will briefly overview the availability and practice of different nanomaterials (particles or fibers) for removal of viruses, inorganic solutes, heavy metals, metal ions, complex <b>organic</b> <b>compounds,</b> natural <b>organic</b> <b>matter,</b> nitrate, and other pollutants present in surface water, ground water, and/or industrial water. Finally, recommendations are made based on the current practices of nanotechnology applications in water industry for a stand-alone water purification unit for removing all types of contaminants from wastewater...|$|R
5000|$|Measurements of <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> {{generally}} measure only <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> or carbon, and so {{are only}} an approximation {{of the level of}} once-living or decomposed matter. Some definitions of <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> likewise only consider [...] "organic matter" [...] to refer to only the carbon content, or <b>organic</b> <b>compounds,</b> and do not consider the origins or decomposition of the matter. In this sense, not all <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> are created by living organisms, and living organisms do not only leave behind organic material. A clam's shell, for example, while biotic, does not contain much organic carbon, so may not be considered <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> in this sense. Conversely, urea is one of many <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> that can be synthesized without any biological activity.|$|R
40|$|The {{long-term}} {{burial of}} organic carbon in sediments {{results in the}} net accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere, thereby mediating the redox state of the Earth's biosphere and atmosphere. Sediment microbial activity {{plays a major role}} in determining whether particulate organic carbon is recycled or buried. A diverse consortium of microorganisms that hydrolyze, ferment, and terminally oxidize <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> mediates anaerobic <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> mineralization in anoxic sediments. Variable temperature regulation of the sequential processes, leading from the breakdown of complex particulate organic carbon to the production and subsequent consumption of labile, low-molecular weight, dissolved intermediates, could play a key role in controlling rates of overall organic carbon mineralization. We examined sediment organic carbon cycling in a sediment slurry and in flow through bioreactor experiments. The data show a variable temperature response of the microbial functional groups mediating <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> mineralization in anoxic marine sediments, resulting in the temperature-driven decoupling of the production and consumption of organic intermediates. This temperature-driven decoupling leads to the accumulation of labile, low-molecular weight, dissolved organic carbon at low temperatures and low-molecular weight dissolved organic carbon limitation of terminal metabolism at higher temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Supercritical CO 2 {{provides}} considerable {{advantages over}} traditional solvents for {{the extraction of}} bioactive <b>compounds</b> from <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> Here we demonstrate the use of supercritical CO 2 as an efficient and safe alternative to traditional solvent extraction for the recovery of bioactive Tyrian purple precursors tyrindoleninone, 6 -bromoisatin and tyriverdin from the marine mollusc Dicathais orbita. The effect {{of pressure on the}} selective extraction of brominated indoles was tested at 15, 30 and 50 MPa CO 2, and was compared to traditional chloroform extract composition and yields. Extracts obtained from 15 MPa selectively concentrated 6 -bromoisatin, at 78 % of the extract composition, whereas increased pressures of 30 and 50 MPa increased the solvating power of supercritical CO 2 to include the more lipophilic tyrindoleninone at 35 and 29 % respectively, and tyriverdin at 23 and 40 % respectively. This extraction method was also effective in separating the brominated indoles from toxic choline esters in the mollusc extracts. Extract yields from supercritical CO 2 were comparable to solvent extraction relative to whole whelk weight. This provides a viable alternative for nutraceutical development that does not rely on the use of toxic solvents...|$|R
40|$|Investigation of {{geochemistry}} of heterocyclic <b>compounds</b> of dispersed <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> (DOM) {{and oils}} of West Siberia {{is an effective}} tool for solving {{a wide range of}} theoretical and applied problems of geology and geochemistry of oil and gas: diagnosing oil-generating rocks (identification of initial type of <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> (OM), diagenetic environment of OM burial, the degree of OM catagenesis, as well as revealing the genetic relations in the series asphaltenes of recent sediments – asphaltenes of DOM – asphaltenes of aqueous bitumens – asphaltenes of oils, and reconstructing biodegraded oils. Jurassic and Cretaceous deposits of West Siberia, accumulating in a wide spectrum of paleogeographic environments, and oils from the host deposits with the age ranging from Aptian-Albian-Cenomanian to Paleozoic, have been chosen as geologic subjects of inquiry. Investigation of resins and asphaltenes was carried out using integrated physical and physicochemical methods (elemental and isotopic analyses, IR-, NMR-, EPR-spectroscopy, Rock-Eval pyrolysis, x-ray diffraction analysis, hydrous pyrolysis, and electron microscopy). The main conclusions are reduced to the following: • Non-hydrocarbon components of DOM of oil-generating rocks and oils derived fro...|$|R
40|$|The {{first stage}} of leaf litter {{decomposition}} of two eucalyptus hybrids and #Acacia auriculiformis$ was studied in laboratory experiments where the decaying leaves were leached with water. Although the litter of both the species were characterized by a high content of soluble <b>compounds,</b> little soluble <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> of acacia litter was recovered in litter leachates. By contrast, soluble <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> of eucalyptus litter was more resistant to degradation and was, therefore, recovered in leachates, where soluble carbon amounts and coloration varied with the age of decomposing litter. The pH of eucalyptus litter leachates decreased {{at the beginning of}} the experiment whereas the pH of acacia litter leachates increased. When added to savanna soil, litter leachates mobilized iron into soil solution, with greater effects observed from eucalyptus than from acacia. In bioassy, litter leachates were added to sand in which test plant seedlings were grown, and a strong allelopathic activity was observed with lechates from the first days of eucalyptus litter decomposition. Leachates from older litter did not show any effect. The possible ecological implications of the observed processes are discussed. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|The lipid {{composition}} of particulate matter in oceanic environments can provide informations {{on the nature}} and origin of the <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> {{as well as on}} their transformation processes. Molecular characteristics for lipids in the Arctic environment have been used as indicators of the sources and transformation of <b>organic</b> particulate <b>matter</b> (Smith et al., 1997; Fahl and Stein, 1997, 1999). However, the features of the lipid {{composition of}} particulate matter in the Arctic with its high seasonality of ice Cover and primary productivity has been studied insufficiently. Lipids {{are one of the most}} important <b>compounds</b> of <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> On the one hand, the composition of lipids is a result of the variability of biological sources (phyto- and zooplankton, higher plants, bacteria etc.). On the other hand, the lipid composition of particulate matter is undergone significant alteration during vertical transport. The <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> balance in the Arctic marginal seas, such as the Kara and Laptev seas, is characterized by the significant supply of dissolved and particulate material by the major Eurasian rivers - Ob, Yenisei and Lena (Cauwet and Sidorov, 1996; Gordeev et al., 1996, Martin et al., 1993). In relation to the world's ocean the primary productivity values are lower in the Arctic seas due to the ice-cover. However local increased values of primary productivity can be connected with the melting processes inducing increased phytoplankton growth near ice-edge (Nelson et al., 1989; Fahl and Stein, 1997) and enhanced river supply of nutrients, These features can influence the proportion of allochtonous and autochtonous components of the <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> in the Arctic marginal seas (Fahl and Stein, 1997; Stein and Fahl, 1999). Furthermore, increased lipid contents in aquatic environments were found near density discontinuities (Parish et al., 1988). Although being less informative than lipid studies on the molecular level the character of lipid composition analysis on the group could also be used for studying of particulate <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> and its transformation in sedimentation processes in the Arctic. In this paper the investigation of the characteristics of lipid composition performed by Alexandrova and Shevchenko (1997) in Arctic seas was continued...|$|R
