40|$|Smart City (SC) {{emerged during}} {{the end of last}} century as a {{reference}} concept for shaping the city of the future. The literature review shows how SC originates from a debate questioning about the future of cities in a world continuously object of pressures: resource scarcity, economic crisis, lack of social identity, besides continuous input from technologies. The progressive permeating of innovative devices, simplifying people life or enabling them in networking and knowledge, led to relevant modification of the built environment. The word “smart” refers therefore not only to the ICT component of city but it also refers to the need of facing an increasing complexity involving all sectors of cities. The extend of approaches, applications, testing and theories coming along with the SC topic oblige the research to critically and extensively study those elements, broadening the analysis to additional experiences, and going toward the definition of SC for coming to a wider definition of Green City as an integrated, sustainable, resilient and smart urban regeneration approach. The research studies these approaches deepening the relation between Architecture Technology and Urban Planning, with a specific insight into a step-by-step project approach and a KPIs performance assessment. The main original output of the research is the proposition of the Green City Circle: a model for addressing the regeneration of districts into existing urban contexts.
