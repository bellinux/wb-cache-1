30|$|With {{respect to}} that adopted in A 2, more complex mixed-signal {{feedback}} correction schemes {{have been proposed}} in literature [10, 18]. In these schemes the output PWM power signal, after attenuation and filtering, is converted in the digital domain through extra ADCs: 7 -bit flash ADC in [10] and 10 -bit SAR ADC in [18]. In the digital domain similar operations to those of A 2 are carried out. These feedback schemes using ADC and operating in the digital domain have been also modelled. The achievable THD and sensitivity performances are slightly better than those of A 2 while the hardware overhead is much higher: an attenuator, a filter and an ADC are required in the analog domain plus a digital <b>correcting</b> <b>unit</b> in the digital one. Being too complex the feedbacks schemes with ADCs are not considered in the comparison of Figures 9 and 10.|$|E
40|$|This paper explores an {{empirical}} methodology {{to assess the}} impacts of trade reforms on household behavior in developing countries. It focuses on consumption and income responses: when price reforms take place, households modify consumption and production decisions and local labor markets adjust. The paper proposes a joint estimator of demand and wage price elasticities from survey data. The method uses {{an empirical}} model of demand to extract price information from unit values, and uses this information to estimate the response of households to price reforms. By <b>correcting</b> <b>unit</b> values for quality effects and measurement error, the method overcomes {{the problem of the}} endogeneity of unit values. By endogeneizing household income, the model corrects potential biases in the estimation of own- and cross-price elasticities in consumption. The paper applies the method to an expenditure and income survey for rural Mexico. It shows that the corrections suggested in this paper are empirically important. In particular, it shows that allowing for consumption and income responses is a key element of an accurate empirical assessment of trade policy.

40|$|Economic reforms {{involving}} the agricultural sector, {{such as those}} being proposed in the WTO Doha Round negotiations, will affect household behavior in developing countries. This paper proposes an empirical methodology to assess the impacts of agricultural price reforms on household outcomes like consumption patterns, sources of income, labor supply, health outcomes, and educational decisions. The method uses an empirical model of demand to extract price information from unit values, and uses this information to estimate the response of households to price changes and price reforms. By <b>correcting</b> <b>unit</b> values for quality effects, the method overcomes the endogeneity and measurement error problems of using unit values as regressors. The methodology is applied to study the responses of household agricultural labor income and labor supply in rural Mexico. I find that higher prices of corn and fruits and vegetables, key goods produced in rural Mexico, significantly increase the agricultural wage income of rural Mexican households. Instead, corn prices {{do not seem to}} affect the labor market decision of young adults. It is shown that using unit values instead of prices may lead to inconsistent results, and that the corrections suggested in this paper may be empirically important...|$|E

40|$|The {{industrial}} pyrolysis furnace {{is a key}} {{equipment in}} ethylene process. It is very essential and important to on-line obtain the accurate yields of products not only for advanced control, process optimization, production evaluation, but also for performance monitoring, safety supervision, and fault diagnosis. However, it is usually difficult to on-line measure the product yields because of many practical reasons in some ethylene plants. In order {{to solve the problem}} on on-line yields prediction of industrial pyrolysis furnace, a soft-sensing approach with multi-inputs and multi-outputs (MIMO), and on-line correcting methods are investigated based on PCA(principal component analysis) -RBF(radial basis function) neural networks. The topology structure of this soft-sensing approach is as follows: the first unit is PCA, the second is RBF neural network, and the third is <b>correcting</b> <b>unit.</b> So the soft-sensing approach combines the abilities of PCA to de-correlate the variables and reduce the dimensionality of the data matrix with that of neural network to approximate any complex nonlinear function. The approach, which is of good real-time property, short modeling time, little calculations, and easily correcting, can be applied to on-line predict the yields of industrial pyrolysis furnace. The good performance of PCA-RBF soft-sensing approach for on-line yields prediction is illustrated by the example from a SRT-IV furnace. The results show that the soft-sensing approach to on-line predict the yields of industrial pyrolysis furnace based on PCA-RBF neural network is effective...|$|E

5000|$|In the {{statement}} of the chain rule, f and g play slightly different roles because f′ is evaluated at g(t) whereas g′ is evaluated at t. This is necessary to make the units work out correctly. For example, suppose {{that we want to}} compute the rate of change in atmospheric pressure ten seconds after the skydiver jumps. This is [...] and has units of Pascals per second. The factor g′(10) in the chain rule is the velocity of the skydiver ten seconds after his jump, and it is expressed in meters per second. f′(g(10)) is the change in pressure with respect to height at the height g(10) and is expressed in Pascals per meter. The product of f′(g(10)) and g′(10) therefore has the <b>correct</b> <b>units</b> of Pascals per second. It is not possible to evaluate f anywhere else. For instance, because the 10 in the problem represents ten seconds, the expression f′(10) represents the change in pressure at a height of ten seconds, which is nonsense. Similarly, because [...] meters per second, the expression f′(g′(10)) represents the change in pressure at a height of −98 meters per second, which is also nonsense. However, g(10) is 3020 meters above sea level, the height of the skydiver ten seconds after his jump. This has the <b>correct</b> <b>units</b> for an input to f.|$|R
