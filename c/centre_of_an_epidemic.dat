40|$|The {{study of}} {{epidemics}} on social networks has attracted considerable attention recently. In this paper, we consider a stochastic SIR (susceptible → infective → removed) {{model for the}} spread <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>epidemic</b> on <b>a</b> finite network, having an arbitrary but specified degree distribution, in which individuals also make casual contacts, i. e. with people chosen uniformly from the population. The behaviour of the model as the network size tends to infinity is investigated. In particular, the basic reproduction number R 0, that governs whether or not <b>an</b> <b>epidemic</b> with few initial infectives can become established is determined, as are the probability that <b>an</b> <b>epidemic</b> becomes established {{and the proportion of}} the population who are ultimately infected by such <b>an</b> <b>epidemic.</b> For the case when the infectious period is constant and all individuals in the network have the same degree, the asymptotic variance and a central limit theorem for the size <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>epidemic</b> that becomes established are obtained. Letting the rate at which individuals make casual contacts decrease to zero yields, heuristically, corresponding results for the model without casual contacts, i. e. for the standard SIR network <b>epidemic</b> model. <b>A</b> deterministic model that approximates the spread <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>epidemic</b> that becomes established in a large population is also derived. The theory is illustrated by numerical studies, which demonstrate that the asymptotic approximations work well, even for only moderately sized networks, and that the degree distribution and the inclusion of casual contacts can each {{have a major impact on}} the outcome <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>epidemic...</b>|$|R

40|$|Contact {{structure}} {{between individuals}} {{in a population}} has a large impact on the spread <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>epidemic</b> within this population. Many techniques and models are used to investigate this, from heterogeneous age-age mixing matrices {{to the use of}} network models in order to quantify the heterogeneity in the populations contacts. For many diseases, the probability of infection per contact, along with the exact contact structure are unknown, compounding the difficulty of identifying accurate contact structures. In this thesis, the impact that the contact structure has on the epidemic is examined in several different ways. Analytical expressions for the variance in the spread <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>epidemic</b> in its early exponential growth phase on heterogeneous networks are derived, showing that the third moment of the degree distribution is needed to fully specify this variance. This quantifies the impact that very well connected individuals can have on the early spread <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>epidemic</b> through <b>a</b> network. The dependency of the potential epidemic on the heterogeneity in workplace sizes and transmission rates is examined. It is shown that large workplaces can increase the expected size of the epidemic significantly, along with increasing the effectiveness of control strategies enacted during the early stages <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>epidemic.</b> In addition to this, a synthetic population is constructed for England and Wales from available datasets, in an attempt to model the spread <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>epidemic</b> through <b>a</b> realistic network <b>of</b> comparable size to the true population. The contact structure that is derived from this is compared with that taken from two surveys of contact structure in the same population, using simple models, and qualitative differences are seen to exist between the surveyed structures and the synthetic population structure...|$|R
