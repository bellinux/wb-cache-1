40|$|The EU Habitats Directive {{provides}} in Annexes II and IV a list {{of species}} needing to be conserved. Member States have implemented a variety of <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> {{in response to this}} obligation. These measures include the rejection, modification or delay of land development plans, payments for landowners to perform <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> and management actions such as breeding programmes. The costs of the various <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> are not always apparent. There may be an underestimation of the resulting costs when land development plans are altered, because there is no visible flow of financial resources. Such a biased perception may result in selecting <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> with high but less visible costs, whereas <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> with low but more visible costs are neglected. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to contribute to avoiding a biased selection of <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> by presenting a framework which captures a broad variety of costs relevant to the conservation of species protected by the Habitats Directive. We also demonstrate the relevance of a biased selection of <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> by using the framework to empirically estimate the costs of protecting the common hamster (Cricetus cricetus) in the region of Mannheim, Germany. We find that the less visible costs of changes in development plans are significantly higher than the more visible costs of payments to landowners and management actions. This result suggests that measures with visible costs should be given more attention in the future.

40|$|AbstractLoss {{of natural}} forests and decline in forest {{biodiversity}} {{has led to}} several policy initiatives in recent years. Despite this, the importance of smaller set-asides vs forest reserves for <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> is poorly understood. We aimed to evaluate the importance of three different area-based <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> commonly used in north-European forests; retention patches, woodland key habitats and forest nature reserves. We did this for two contrasting ecological systems; fungi in late-decay spruce logs and beetles in early-decay aspen snags. Eight replicated sites {{for each of the}} three <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> were investigated in a total of four boreal forest landscapes in south-Norway. Fungi were surveyed on existent late-decay spruce logs in two landscapes, and beetles trapped on experimentally added aspen dead-wood units in three landscapes. Richness and species composition were analyzed separately for specialist and generalist species. We found larger differences in species composition between <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> for old-growth fungi specialists than generalists, although species richness patterns were less clear. The main contrast was found between nature reserves and retention patches. On the other hand, specialist beetles associated with early-decay aspen showed no difference between set-asides. The assemblage of aspen generalist beetles tended to be richest in the woodland key habitats and showed clear differences between the <b>conservation</b> <b>measures.</b> There was considerable variation in response to <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> between landscapes, related to quality of the set-asides. Species specialized to an ephemeral, early-decay system were able to utilize such substrates in all of the <b>conservation</b> <b>measures,</b> while the smaller and more modified set-asides could not cater for the specialists dependent on stable, late-decay systems. Species with broader habitat demands in general responded to all <b>conservation</b> <b>measures.</b> We conclude that retention patches, woodland key habitats and forest reserves fill complementary functions for wood-living species in boreal forest and should all be part of future forest conservation strategies...|$|R

This project analyses the psychological factors behind public acceptance of biodiversity <b>conservation</b> <b>measures.</b> In an empirical study, perceptual and emotional responses to three types of broadleaf deciduous forests with different vegetation structure and species composition are studied.

40|$|AbstractUnsustainable {{land use}} {{management}} and the resulting soil erosion {{are among the most}} pervasive problems in rural Ethiopia, where most of the country’s people live, jeopardizing food security. Despite various efforts to introduce soil <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> and assess their costs and benefits, it is unclear how efficient these measures are from an economic point of view in securing food production. This paper examines {{the costs and benefits of}} three soil <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> applied in the country in three different rural districts facing different degrees of soil erosion problems using survey data collected from 750 farm households. A production function is estimated to quantify the costs and benefits of more sustainable land use management practices. We show that the soil <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> significantly increase productivity and hence food security. Comparing the costs and benefits, the results indicate that implementing soil <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> would benefit farm communities in the case study areas through increased grain productivity and food security...|$|R
