5|$|<b>Capybara</b> {{gestation}} is 130–150 days, {{and produces}} {{a litter of}} four <b>capybara</b> young on average, but may produce between one and eight in a single litter. Birth is on land and the female rejoins the group {{within a few hours}} of delivering the newborn capybaras, which join the group as soon as they are mobile. Within a week, the young can eat grass, but continue to suckle—from any female in the group—until weaned around 16 weeks. The young form a group within the main group. Alloparenting has been observed in this species. Breeding peaks between April and May in Venezuela and between October and November in Mato Grosso, Brazil.|$|E

50|$|The genus Hydrochoerus {{contains}} two living and two extinct species of <b>capybaras</b> from South America, the Caribbean island of Grenada, and Panama. <b>Capybaras</b> {{are the largest}} living rodents in the world. The genus name {{is derived from the}} Greek ὕδωρ (hýdor, water) plus χοίρος (choíros, pig).|$|R
40|$|Abstract <b>Capybaras</b> (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) are {{the largest}} rodents found in South America. The aim {{of the present study}} was to {{investigate}} the occurrence of anti-Toxoplasma gondii and anti-Neospora caninum antibodies in 170 free-living <b>capybaras</b> in a residential park area in Itu Municipality, São Paulo State, Brazil. Serum samples were tested by indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) for T. gondii (IFAT ≥ 1 : 16) and N. caninum (IFAT ≥ 1 : 50). Among the 170 samples analyzed, 10 % (17 / 170) and 0 % (0 / 170) were seropositive for T. gondii and N. caninum, respectively. This study confirms the widespread presence of T. gondii and reinforces the role of <b>capybaras</b> in the life cycle of this parasite. <b>Capybaras</b> may not be important as intermediate hosts of N. caninum in the studied environment...|$|R
5|$|Like its {{relative}} the guinea pig, the <b>capybara</b> {{does not have}} the capacity to synthesize vitamin C, and capybaras not supplemented with vitamin C in captivity have been reported to develop gum disease as a sign of scurvy.|$|E
5|$|The <b>capybara</b> and {{the lesser}} <b>capybara</b> {{belong to the}} {{subfamily}} Hydrochoerinae along with the rock cavies. The living capybaras and their extinct relatives were previously classified in their own family Hydrochoeridae. Since 2002, molecular phylogenetic studies have recognized a close relationship between Hydrochoerus and Kerodon, the rock cavies, supporting placement of both genera in a subfamily of Caviidae. Paleontological classifications have yet to incorporate this new taxonomy and continue to use Hydrochoeridae for all capybaras, while using Hydrochoerinae for the living genus and its closest fossil relatives, such as Neochoerus. The taxonomy of fossil hydrochoerines is also {{in a state of}} flux. In recent years, the diversity of fossil hydrochoerines has been substantially reduced. This is largely due to the recognition that <b>capybara</b> molar teeth show strong variation in shape over the life of an individual. In one instance, material once referred to four genera and seven species on the basis of differences in molar shape is now thought to represent differently aged individuals of a single species, Cardiatherium paranense.|$|E
5|$|Capybaras are semiaquatic mammals found {{throughout}} almost all countries of South America except Chile. They live in densely forested areas near bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, swamps, ponds, and marshes, {{as well as}} flooded savannah and along rivers in tropical forest. <b>Capybara</b> have flourished in cattle ranches. They roam in home ranges averaging 10 hectares (25 acres) in high-density populations.|$|E

50|$|Caviidae (cavies, <b>capybaras,</b> and maras). Six genera and 20 species.|$|R
500|$|<b>Capybaras</b> {{have two}} types of scent glands; a morillo (...) , located on the snout, and anal glands. Both sexes have these glands, but males have much larger morillos and use their anal glands more frequently. The anal glands of males are also lined with {{detachable}} hairs. A crystalline form of scent secretion is coated on these hairs and is released when in contact with objects such as plants. These hairs have a longer-lasting scent mark and are tasted by other <b>capybaras.</b> <b>Capybaras</b> scent-mark by rubbing their morillos on objects, or by walking over scrub and marking it with their anal glands. <b>Capybaras</b> can spread their scent further by urinating; however, females usually mark without urinating and scent-mark less frequently than males overall. Females mark more often during the wet season {{when they are in}} estrus. In addition to objects, males also scent-mark females.|$|R
5|$|Rodents make up {{the largest}} order of mammals, with over 40 percent of {{mammalian}} species. They have two incisors in {{the upper and lower}} jaw which grow continually and must be kept short by gnawing. Most rodents are small though the <b>capybara,</b> a rodent native to South America, can weigh up to 45kg (100lb).|$|E
5|$|The <b>capybara</b> has a heavy, {{barrel-shaped}} {{body and}} short head, with reddish-brown fur {{on the upper}} part of its body that turns yellowish-brown underneath. Its sweat glands {{can be found in the}} surface of the hairy portions of its skin, an unusual trait among rodents. The animal lacks down hair, and its guard hair differs little from over hair.|$|E
5|$|Capybaras are farmed {{for meat}} and skins in South America. The meat is {{considered}} unsuitable {{to eat in}} some areas, while in other areas it is considered {{an important source of}} protein. In parts of South America, especially in Venezuela, <b>capybara</b> meat is popular during Lent and Holy Week as the Catholic Church previously issued special dispensation to allow it to be eaten while other meats are generally forbidden.|$|E
5000|$|Caviinae is a {{subfamily}} uniting {{all living}} {{members of the}} family Caviidae {{with the exception of the}} maras, <b>capybaras,</b> and Kerodon. The subfamily traditionally contained the guinea pig-like forms along with the cursorially adapted (running) Kerodon. Molecular results suggest the Caviinae as so defined would be paraphyletic and Kerodon is more closely related to maras and <b>capybaras</b> than to other caviines. [...] This led Woods and Kilpatrick (2005) to unite Kerodon and <b>capybaras</b> into the subfamily Hydrochoerinae within the Caviidae. These studies also suggest Microcavia and Cavia are more closely related to one another than either is to Galea.|$|R
5|$|<b>Capybaras</b> are herbivores, grazing {{mainly on}} grasses and aquatic plants, {{as well as}} fruit and tree bark. They are very {{selective}} feeders and feed on the leaves of one species and disregard other species surrounding it. They eat {{a greater variety of}} plants during the dry season, as fewer plants are available. While they eat grass during the wet season, they have to switch to more abundant reeds during the dry season. Plants that <b>capybaras</b> eat during the summer lose their nutritional value in the winter, so are not consumed at that time. The <b>capybara's</b> jaw hinge is not perpendicular, so they chew food by grinding back-and-forth rather than side-to-side. <b>Capybaras</b> are autocoprophagous, meaning they eat their own feces as a source of bacterial gut flora, to help digest the cellulose in the grass that forms their normal diet, and to extract the maximum protein and vitamins from their food. They may also regurgitate food to masticate again, similar to cud-chewing by cattle. As is the case with other rodents, the front teeth of <b>capybaras</b> grow continually to compensate for the constant wear from eating grasses; their cheek teeth also grow continuously.|$|R

5|$|Capybaras are gregarious. While they {{sometimes}} live solitarily, {{they are more}} commonly found in groups of around 10–20 individuals, with two to four adult males, four to seven adult females, and the remainder juveniles. <b>Capybara</b> groups can consist {{of as many as}} 50 or 100 individuals during the dry season when the animals gather around available water sources. Males establish social bonds, dominance, or general group consensus. They can make dog-like barks when threatened or when females are herding young.|$|E
5|$|The fossils from Punta Alta {{included}} a nearly perfect head and three fragments of {{heads of the}} Megatherium Cuvierii, the jaw of a related species which Owen named Mylodon Darwinii, and jaws of Megalonyx Jeffersonii. The near complete skeleton was named Scelidotherium by Owen, who found it had most of its bones nearly in their proper relative positions. At the nearby Monte Hermoso beds the numerous rodents included species allied to the Brazilian tuco-tuco and the <b>capybara.</b>|$|E
5|$|Charles Lyell eagerly met Darwin for {{the first}} time on 29 October and soon {{introduced}} him to the up-and-coming anatomist Richard Owen, who had the facilities of the Royal College of Surgeons to work on the fossil bones collected by Darwin. Owen's surprising results included other gigantic extinct ground sloths as well as the Megatherium, a near complete skeleton of the unknown Scelidotherium and a hippopotamus-sized rodent-like skull named Toxodon resembling a giant <b>capybara.</b> The armour fragments were actually from Glyptodon, a huge armadillo-like creature as Darwin had initially thought. These extinct creatures were related to living species in South America.|$|E
5|$|<b>Capybaras</b> {{have adapted}} {{well to the}} {{urbanization}} in South America. They {{can be found in}} many areas in zoos and parks, and may live for 12 years in captivity. <b>Capybaras</b> are gentle and usually allow humans to pet and hand-feed them, but physical contact is normally discouraged, as their ticks can be vectors to Rocky Mountain spotted fever.|$|R
40|$|Abstract INTRODUCTION: Brazilian {{native species}} are reemerging as {{increasingly}} free-ranging populations. METHODS: Sera from 31 <b>capybaras</b> (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) and 28 peccaries (Pecari tajacu and Tayassu pecari) were tested for anti-Leptospira and anti-Toxoplasma gondii antibodies using microscopic seroagglutination test. RESULTS: Nineteen percent of free-ranging and 10. 0 % of captive <b>capybaras,</b> along with 31. 8 % of collared peccaries, were seropositive for T. gondii. None was seropositive for Leptospira sp. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings indicated low risk of disease, particularly among <b>capybaras</b> and white-lipped peccaries; however, active surveillance programs {{are important for}} monitoring wildlife health and public health once they are in public parks around cities...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{short and long term}} {{influences}} of ascorbic acid on Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris, if supplemented in their food. No differences regarding food intake were observed in the absence of vitamin C. On a daily basis, animals accustomed to food containing ascorbic acid prefered to continue eating the same food. Food preference in <b>capybaras</b> did not seem to depend on ascorbic acid availability; however, when accustomed to vitamin C, <b>capybaras</b> might recognize and select ascorbic acid in subsequent food. Mechanisms allowing <b>capybaras</b> to "evaluate" the nutritional quality of their food are discussed, as well as the adaptive value of this behavior in free ranging populations...|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{all other}} Panthera species, jaguars very rarely attack humans. However, jaguar attacks {{appear to be}} on the rise with {{increased}} human encroachment on their habitat and a decrease in prey populations. Sometimes jaguars in captivity attack zookeepers. In addition, it appears that attacks on humans had been more common in the past, at least after Conquistadors arrived in the Americas, {{to the extent that the}} jaguar had a fearsome reputation in the Americas, akin to the lion and tiger in the Old World. Nevertheless, even in those times, the jaguar's chief prey was the <b>capybara,</b> not the human, and Charles Darwin reported a saying of Native Americans that people would not have to fear the jaguar much, as long as capybaras were abundant.|$|E
25|$|In June 2016, {{two male}} <b>capybara</b> pups {{were born to}} Kosh, (a male who arrived from Chester Zoo late 2015) and mother Consuela. They were named Pepe and Pablo. The pups bring Auckland Zoo's <b>capybara</b> total up to five individuals.|$|E

40|$|Quantitative {{parameters}} of intestinal helminth species {{and their potential}} relations to host characteristics in a population of <b>capybaras</b> (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) from Venezuela are reported for the first time. The intestines of 40 <b>capybaras</b> were collected during the 1992 -annual harvest at Hato El Cedral. Six helminth species were found: 2 cestodes (Monoecocestus macrobursatum, M. hagmanni), 2 nematodes (Viannella hydrochoeri, Protozoophaga obesa), and 2 trematodes (Hippocrepis hippocrepis, Taxorchis schistocotyle). This is the first report for M. macrobursatum in Venezuela. Helminth abundance did not differ between sexes or age classes. Although patterns of distribution for all helminth species were overdispersed, the high prevalence found for all species (over 70 %) and the high abundance observed for nematodes {{made it difficult to}} assess the effect that these helminths may produce on <b>capybaras.</b> Nevertheless, the negative associations found between the body condition of <b>capybaras</b> and helminth intensity for M. macrobursatum and V. hydrochoeri, might be pointing out potential host population regulatory role for these parasites which require further research...|$|R
40|$|Since 2008 16 <b>capybaras</b> {{died in the}} Natura Artis Magistra Zoo in Amsterdam. At {{post mortem}} lymphoid tumours, like {{multiple}} myeloma or malign lymphoma, were found in all animals, except one. C type retroviruses are associated with malignancies of blood forming cells. Bovine Leukaemia Virus (BLV) and Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus (PERV) are C type retroviruses and might possibly be the causative agent. To detect these retroviruses, a PCR is convenient. To perform a PCR, extraction of DNA from tissue is needed and to verify the DNA extraction, a PCR with the housekeeping gene GAPDH is performed. After which, PCR’s for PERV and BLV are performed. Samples of two <b>capybaras</b> were positive for Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus, but negative for exogenous retrovirus. PCR products obtained with BLV primers from all the <b>capybaras</b> showed no homology with any retroviral sequences. More {{research is needed to}} investigate if there are other retroviruses detectable in the tissues from these <b>capybaras</b> from the Natura Magistra Zoo...|$|R
40|$|Santa Catarina Island {{possesses}} {{dozens of}} archeological sites where the skeletal {{remains of a}} great array of animals can be found. The goal {{of this study was}} to quantify the skeletal remains of <b>capybaras</b> found at the archeological site SC PRV 02 (1067 to 1735 BP), located in the northern part of the island, along the shores of Lagoa da Conceição, a saltwater lagoon. Thirty-seven skeletal fragments of at least 12 different individuals were identified. The anatomic regions of the <b>capybaras</b> most sought-after by pre-colonial inhabitants were the anterior and posterior limbs. About 40 % of the skeletal fragments did not show any epiphyseal fusion with the shaft. Approximately 48 % of the fragments found presented evidence of human activity. Our analyses suggest that <b>capybaras</b> played an important role in the diet of these inhabitants and that they were also used for the confection of different functional goods. We diagnosed the manipulation techniques used to obtain these goods, such as percussion and transversal section. The evidence of carbonization and superficial incisions indicates dismembering, preparation, and consumption of <b>capybaras</b> for feeding. Similar techniques were found at other archeological sites of the same age, suggesting that even though pre-colonial inhabitants of the island were considered to be fishermen, <b>capybaras</b> represented a well-appreciated resource...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} feeding habitats of <b>capybaras</b> in the ESEC-Taim (RS, Brazil), using microhistological analyses of feces. Data were analyzed seasonally.

Zizaniopsis bonariensis was the most frequent species in winter (38 %), spring (32 %) and summer (26. 5 %) and Paspalum disthichum in fall (31. 5 %). A observed increase in vegetation consumption during summer might be due to the food quality. <b>Capybaras</b> showed an opportunistic behavior in the winter and summer and a more selective behavior in spring and fall. <b>Capybaras</b> from the ESEC-Taim varied diet according to the season and alimentary availability...|$|R
