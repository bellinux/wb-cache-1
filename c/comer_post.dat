5000|$|Western Suburbs {{played with}} {{the wind in the}} first half, but this {{assistance}} was not of much advantage. Eastern Suburbs backs were particularly smart in making openings, Cubitt moving about in good style whenever an opportunity offered. Norman was also clever In all-round play. The Western Suburbs backs could not get going, though several strong attempts were made. Wright put in a couple of fast runs for Eastern Suburbs without avail. He was well watched, and his centre kicks were blocked. Two long kicks by White drove the ball over the line for a force in each case. Freeman did not appear at all safe at full-back. There was only one score in the first half. Caples put In a fine run, and with a clear field looked certain to score. His speed slackened, and when collared from behind be passed back to Cubitt, who easily scored a try. Messenger added a goal, and Eastern Suburbs led by 5 to nil at half-time.A fine dash by the Eastern Suburbs forwards soon after play was restarted ended in a knock-on near the corner post. The backs then took part in a fine attack, Wright being twisted round into touch by Vest. A free, however, was awarded Eastern Suburbs, and Messenger sent the ball just under the bar. Caples was kicking strongly, and several times got his side out of difficult positions. Neither set of backs, how-ever, handled the ball well, but, on the other hand, the tackling was particularly good. Cubitt distinguished himself by solid defence, and Norman was continually prominent in taking man and ball. Western Suburbs seemed unable to make progress, and good passing by their opponents ended in Messenger and Wright being blocked on the respective Wings. Wright once kicked the ball against the <b>comer</b> <b>post.</b> Burns and Gilbert made strong efforts to get through as the game advanced, but they were effectually collared. Near the close Messenger missed a goal from a free, and, the second half being scoreless. Eastern Suburbs won by 5 points to nil ...|$|E

Tatham, who had lost to Casmir in the semifinal pool, defeated him {{the second time around}} to take third place.|$|R

Like the communication and information technology which is the complement of daily activity process of organizations reconstruction (including electronical banking, electronical <b>comers,</b> electronical <b>post,</b> electronical government [...] .), elec-tronical learning or training realm are also promises of far-fetched goals performance. Now a day, it does not seem to be a prominent limitation by elimination of time, place and learners age that was a far goal in tow decades ago. On the other hand, traditional educational methods will not respond to the expansive requirement of high growing skills and information-based technology. Although traditional educational system has characteristics that ignoring them reduces the influence of learning and can be the cause of abnormality...|$|R
5|$|Post {{is where}} {{mainstream}} music could have gone. While modern chart music hasn't gone there entirely, Björk {{opened up the}} space for a more enigmatic and less readily labelled style; she undoubtedly helped broaden the playing field. Modern music still, regularly, finds itself, like a dinosaur stuck in a tar pit, going nowhere and heading for extinction. Yet, there are pockets of air that artists like Björk - and those before her like Kate Bush - have pumped full of oxygen for the next generations of rare, raw and intense female talents - the Lordes and Sias of the world - to breath. In this way, the album title is a misnomer. Björk was a precursor rather than a late <b>comer,</b> less <b>post</b> than pre. Post stands today as {{a body of work}} that still informs the more marginal artistic fringes of modern music and reminds us how narrow and staid our world would be without outliers like Björk.|$|R
5000|$|The album's {{influence}} {{has been identified}} as being increasingly palpable on the contemporary music landscape, and later reviews of the album also make note of the timeless aspect of the music. According to Upma Kapoor, Post [...] "dropped and shifted the status quo on how to produce and promote experimental music". Writing for The Daily Review, James Rose wrote in 2015:Post is where mainstream music could have gone. While modern chart music hasn't gone there entirely, Björk opened up the space for a more enigmatic and less readily labelled style; she undoubtedly helped broaden the playing field. Modern music still, regularly, finds itself, like a dinosaur stuck in a tar pit, going nowhere and heading for extinction.

Post stands today as a body of work that still informs the more marginal artistic fringes of modern music and reminds us how narrow and staid our world would be without outliers like Björk.Also in 2015, Andrew Shaw of Nerdist felt that Post [...] "chose to ignore expectation, market restrictions, and contemporary trends", and that [...] "the singer pushed her vocal performances into new places, where no other vocalists could dare to sing". He compared the album's impact on audiences to that of Jimi Hendrix's 1967 album, Are You Experienced, writing it [...] "set the benchmark for what was possible when you take tradition and set it on fire". Shaw also argued further that the album was a classic and, as a whole, [...] "simply genius"; considering [...] "the masterstroke of the collection is in the thread that ties each disparate view into one singular perspective". David Longstreth of Dirty Projectors is an admirer of the record, stating he was influenced by Björk's deconstruction of classic melodies. American singer-songwriter Amy Lee has said Post is [...] "one of the biggest records in her life".|$|R
