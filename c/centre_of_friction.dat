The biomechanical {{response of the}} investigation implies that the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> pressure moves accordingly with the motion of foot such as heel strike and take-off. The respective ground reaction forces are measured using a force platform. The data from the force platform are collected using a data acquisition system and processed using BiowareTM software. Curves of acceleration-time, displacement–time, power and impulse are calculated from the ground reaction force record obtained from the force plate. The <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> pressure, <b>friction,</b> torque and moment during walking was also calculated. In this study 57 participants have participated including male, female and differently abled subjects.

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that the coefficient <b>of</b> <b>friction</b> between the friction pair, the pad and the rotor plays {{a significant role}} in the propensity of a brake to generate noise. Because of the ease with which changes may be made to the pad compound material it is this that is more often the subject of change when there is a problematic noisy brake with both the rotor and the calliper tending to remain 'isolated' from examination. This paper investigates the propensity of a brake to generate noise over a range of temperatures and pressures under conditions that allow a mechanically induced offset <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> pressure between the pad and rotor to be varied. It is shown that for a high-volume production car brake there is an increased tendency for it to generate noise when a very specific leading offset <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> pressure is engineered. With this condition it is shown that a situation is promoted whereby the brake becomes mechanically unstable, with system changes such as brake pressure and temperature variations having little influence on the brake to alter its tendency to generate noise. Furthermore, it is shown that the critical offset <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> pressure may be related to the coefficient <b>of</b> <b>friction</b> between the friction pair and the mounting geometry of the calliper. Confirmation of the findings are supported by a repeat investigation of the vehicle's alternative brake calliper. It is suggested that the source of a noisy brake may lie as much in basic mechanical design as inappropriate material choice.
