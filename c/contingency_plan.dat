40|$|With the {{increasing}} frequency, magnitude {{and impact of}} disasters, there is growing focus on <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> {{as a tool for}} enhancing resilience. Yet, there is little empirical evidence that reflects on the practice of <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> systems within the context of disaster risk reduction. This article explores the practice of <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> in southern Africa, focussing on Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe. A qualitative comparative analysis informed by fieldwork was used. The findings show that (1) there was a wide gap between theory and practice in <b>contingency</b> <b>planning,</b> (2) response activities rarely reflected projected scenarios and (3) resources were inadequate for effective <b>contingency</b> <b>planning.</b> We conclude that unless these issues are addressed, <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> is likely o remain a theoretical rather than a practical tool for building disaster-resilient communities in southern African countries. Although a generalisation cannot be made on the status of <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> and practice in southern Africa without a wider analysis of more examples, the findings may apply beyond the examined contexts and also offer insights into research gaps...|$|R

The planning involves the development of <b>contingency</b> <b>plans</b> based on the four pillars: prevention, preparation, response and recovery and the conduct of simulation exercises.

40|$|Despite {{consistent}} {{evidence for}} the positive impact of <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> for falls in older people, implementation of plans often fail. This is likely {{due to lack of}} recognition and knowledge about perspectives of older people about <b>contingency</b> <b>planning.</b> The objective of this research was to explore the perspectives of older people living in the community about use of <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> for getting help quickly after a fall. A systematic literature search seeking qualitative research was conducted in April 2014, with no limit placed on date of publication. Medline, EMBASE, Ageline, CINAHL, HealthSource- Nursing/Academic Edition, AMED and Psych INFO databases were searched. Three main concepts were explored and linked using Boolean operators; older people, falls and <b>contingency</b> <b>planning.</b> The search was updated until February 2016 with no new articles found. After removal of duplicates, 562 articles were assessed against inclusion and exclusion criteria resulting in six studies for the meta-synthesis. These studies were critically appraised using the McMaster critical appraisal tool. Bespoke data extraction sheets were developed and a meta-synthesis approach was adopted to extract and synthesise findings. Three themes of 'a mix of attitudes', 'careful deliberations' and 'a source of anxiety' were established. Perspectives of older people were on a continuum between regarding <b>contingency</b> <b>plans</b> as necessary and not necessary. Levels of engagement with the <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> process seemed associated with acceptance of their risk of falling and their familiarity with available <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> strategies. Avoiding a long lie on the floor following a fall is imperative for older people in the community but {{there is a lack of}} knowledge about <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> for falls. This meta-synthesis provides new insights into this area of health service delivery and highlights that implementation of plans needs to be directed by the older people rather than the health professionals...|$|R
5|$|Discovering that Talbot {{has already}} confiscated the painting, Coulson agrees {{to meet with}} him after {{debriefing}} his team. Meanwhile, May follows Talbot, who is actually Hydra agent Sunil Bakshi using advanced technology to take on Talbot's voice and appearance. May is attacked by Agent 33, a former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent brainwashed into Hydra's service, who knocks May unconscious and uses the same device to take on her voice and appearance. Agent 33 goes to the Bus, a S.H.I.E.L.D. plane being used as a mobile command center, where she secretly plants a computer virus before meeting with Coulson. Further discussing his <b>contingency</b> <b>plan,</b> in which May would kill Coulson and replace him as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Coulson deduces that Agent 33 is not May and turns on her; this draws the attention of Bakshi, who was ready to torture May to gain S.H.I.E.L.D. secrets.|$|E

STCUM chose those dates due to the event's high-profile status as public transport was classified as an essential service over the weekend. It would also result in the road leading to the circuit being blocked off to spectators. STCUM appeared before Essential Services Council on 9 June to discuss producing a <b>contingency</b> <b>plan</b> to ensure spectators would attend the Grand Prix with full services running.

The report also identified inadequate pre-trip inspections and log book keeping, and the lack of a <b>contingency</b> <b>plan</b> in the event of poor weather. Transport Canada stated that although they put an added emphasis on some factors, their report was consistent with the RCMP's. They concurred that the vehicle would have failed an inspection in its pre-collision state because of worn tires and brakes.|$|E

5|$|A December 2007 QSR Magazine {{article about}} the {{conflict}} claimed that Burger King Brands had devised a <b>contingency</b> <b>plan</b> to remove itself from the dispute.

As part of the company's plan, QSR Magazine claimed that the company was going to cease purchasing product from suppliers with whom the CIW was in disagreement. In response, the company issued a press release in February 2007 claiming that while it is a large purchaser, it is not responsible for the pay rates of it suppliers' workers as wage disputes are the province of the producer. BK also pointed out that it has an open offer of employment for any dissatisfied CIW members and scholarships (through its Have it Your Way Foundation) for family members of CIW workers.|$|E
5|$|As Kujira {{began to}} track towards Taiwan, the Taiwanese {{government}} issued land- and sea-based warnings {{in advance of}} the storm. The local weather bureau specifically alerted vessels off the southern and southeastern coasts of the island. Continued strengthening of Kujira prompted the Central Weather Bureau to issue medium typhoon warnings for several portions of Taiwan, though these warnings were downgraded to light typhoon status following the subsequent weakening of the typhoon on April22. This made Kujira the first April typhoon to prompt the issuance of any cyclone-related warnings in Taiwan since 1978. Impacts on the island were expected to be limited to rainfall, though the forecasted precipitation was also expected to lessen ongoing drought conditions. However, mudslides were also a potential impact from the typhoon. The National Fire Administration and Taiwan Power Company developed a <b>contingency</b> <b>plan</b> for the typhoon and had also undertaken other precautionary measures. Airports on Orchid Island and Green Island were closed. The resultant rainfall from Kujira's outer rainbands would be some of the most significant for the island in several months.|$|E
