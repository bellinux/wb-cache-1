40|$|Background: Pain during {{menstruation}} is not uncommon, {{especially in}} young women, {{which has an}} impact on their life activities. Objective: To examine the effect of abdominal stretching exercise and <b>cold</b> compress <b>therapy</b> on decreasing intensity of menstrual pain in teenage girls at SMK Bakti Indonesia Medika. Design: A Quasy Experimental Study with two group comparison pretest-postest design. There were 46 respondents selected in this study by consecutive sampling that consisted of 23 samples in the abdominal stretching exercise group and 23 samples in the cold compress group. The menstrual pain was measured using VAS (visual analog scale). Data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney, Chi-Square, and Wilcoxon test. Results: Findings showed that the mean of menstrual pain before intervention in the abdominal stretching exercise was 7. 04 and in the <b>cold</b> compress <b>therapy</b> was 6. 74 with p-value 0. 211 (< 0. 05), which indicated that there was no mean difference of pain between both groups. However, after intervention, the menstrual pain was reduced from 7. 04 to 1. 91 (5. 09 difference) in the abdominal stretching exercise group; and from 6. 74 to 5. 52 (1. 22 difference) in the cold compress group with p-value 0. 000 (< 0. 05), which indicated that there was statistically significant difference of menstrual pain before and after intervention, both abdominal stretching exercise and <b>cold</b> compress <b>therapy.</b> Conclusion: There were statistically significant effects of abdominal stretching exercise and <b>cold</b> compress <b>therapy</b> on menstrual pain in teenage girls. The abdominal stretching exercise is more effective than <b>cold</b> compress <b>therapy</b> in reducing menstrual pain intensity. Thus, it is suggested that abdominal stretching exercise can be an alternative choice of management of dysmenorrhea in teenage girls, and can be a part of subject in the education as non-pharmacological medicine...|$|R

[...] NSAID's such as Ibuprofen/paracetamol work to reduce the immediate inflammation by inhibiting Cox-1 & Cox-2 enzymes, which are the enzymes responsible for converting arachidonic acid into prostaglandin. [...] However, NSAIDs, including aspirin and ibuprofen, affect platelet function (this is why they are known as [...] "blood thinners") and should not be taken during the period when tissue is bleeding because they will tend to increase blood flow, inhibit clotting, and thereby increase bleeding and swelling. After the bleeding has stopped, NSAIDs can be used with some effectiveness to reduce inflammation and pain.|$|R

30|$|Two main {{methods for}} {{encapsulating}} PCM are macroencapsulation and microencapsulation. They {{are different in}} terms of the final capsule sizes. Microencapsulation is defined as wrapping any material in a capsule with its diameter between 1 and 1000  µm. Beyond this range, the capsules are called macrocapsules [4]. Comparing the two encapsulation approaches, microencapsulation results in greater surface area-to-volume ratio to enhance the heat transfer performance, improved durability, and suppressed supercooling [14]. Extensive researches were conducted to encapsulate various organic and inorganic PCMs by a wide range of polymers, such as polystyrene [15], poly(methyl methacrylate-co-divinylbenzene) [16], phenolic resin [17], vinyl trimethoxysilane [18], and urea–formaldehyde resin [19]. Furthermore, researchers investigated different fabrication techniques to encapsulate PCM. These include in situ polymerization [16, 20] interfacial polymerization [14], emulsion polymerization [21], condensation polymerization [22], and solvent evaporation [23]. Depending on their melting points, encapsulated PCM can be used in many different areas, including food and pharmaceutical preservation, blood transport, solar power plants, electronic devices, space equipment’s, textile, sportswear, hot and <b>cold</b> <b>therapies,</b> building materials, etc. [24, 25].|$|R

40|$|Jon E BlockJon E Block, PhD., Incorporated, San Francisco, CA, USAAbstract: Cold and {{compression}} {{are routinely}} applied immediately after acute injury or &shy;following surgery to alleviate pain, reduce swelling and speed functional recovery. The {{objective of this}} literature review is to describe the published clinical findings regarding combined <b>cold</b> and compression <b>therapy</b> {{in the management of}} musculoskeletal injuries and after orthopedic operative procedures. Of 33 potential articles triaged, the findings of 21 randomized controlled trials were assessed and summarized. The findings reported by these 21 studies were largely subjective pain outcomes and, to a lesser degree, swelling and range of motion, and were inconsistent and divergent, making it difficult to recommend the most appropriate, effective clinical application of cold and compression. Further, 18 of the 21 reported studies evaluated cold and static compression, where the extent and duration of the compression was not uniform within or across studies. Operative procedures may offer a more controlled environment for rigorous investigations. However, such studies must be powered sufficiently to account for variations in surgical procedure that could affect outcomes. More uniform operative procedures, such as total knee arthroplasty, represent a well circumscribed intervention for studying the clinical utility of <b>cold</b> compression <b>therapy</b> because the operative technique is standardized, surgical tissue damage is extensive, intraoperative blood loss is high, and post-operative edema and pain are severe. Findings from randomized controlled trials of knee arthroplasty generally showed <b>cold</b> compression <b>therapy</b> provides better outcomes such as pain relief than alternative interventions. While the effects of cold and static compression are clearly better than no treatment, they {{do not appear to be}} directly additive. Keywords: cryotherapy, injur...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{implications}} of undertaking DXA scans using best practice protocols (subjects fasted and rested) or a less precise but more practical protocol in assessing chronic changes in body composition following training and a specialized recovery technique were investigated. Methods: Twenty-one male cyclists completed an overload training program, {{in which they}} were randomized to four sessions per week of either <b>cold</b> water immersion <b>therapy</b> or control groups. Whole-body DXA scans were undertaken with Best Practice (BEST) or Random Activity (RANDOM) protocols at baseline, after 3 weeks of overload training and after a 2 week taper. Magnitudes of changes in total, lean and fat mass from baseline-overload, overload-taper and baseline-taper were assessed by standardization (?mean/SD). Results: The standard deviations of change scores for total and fat-free soft tissue mass (FFST) from RANDOM scans (2 - 3 %) were approximately double those observed in the BEST protocol (1 - 2 %), owing to extra random errors associated with RANDOM scans at baseline. There was little difference in change scores for fat mass. The effect of <b>cold</b> water immersion <b>therapy</b> on baseline-taper changes in FFST was possibly harmful (- 0. 7 %; 90 % confidence limits ᱮ 2 %) with BEST scans but unclear with RANDOM scans (0. 9 %; Ხ 0 %). Both protocols gave similar possibly harmful effects of <b>cold</b> water immersion <b>therapy</b> on changes in fat mass (6. 9 %; ᱳ. 5 % and 5. 5 %; ᱴ. 3 %, respectively). Conclusions: An interesting effect of <b>cold</b> water immersion <b>therapy</b> on training-induced changes in body composition might have been missed with a less precise scanning protocol.

40|$|Tuberculosis (TB) {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of {{morbidity}} and mortality worldwide. Early diagnosis and treatment are key to prevent Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission. Bronchoscopy can play a primary role in pulmonary TB diagnosis, particularly for suspected patients with scarce sputum or sputum smear negativity, and with endobronchial disease. Bronchoscopic needle aspiration techniques are accurate and safe means adopted to investigate hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes in cases of suspected TB lymphadenopathy. Tracheobronchial stenosis represents the worst complication of endobronchial tuberculosis. Bronchoscopic procedures are less invasive therapeutic strategies than conventional surgery to be adopted in the management of TB-related stenosis. We conducted a non-systematic review aimed at describing the scientific literature on the role of bronchoscopic techniques in the diagnosis and therapy of patients with TB. We focused on three main areas of interventions: bronchoscopic diagnosis of smear negative/sputum scarce TB patients, endobronchial TB diagnosis and treatment and needle aspiration techniques for intrathoracic TB lymphadenopathy. We described experiences on bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial washing, and biopsy techniques for the diagnosis of patients with tracheobronchial and pulmonary TB; furthermore, we described the role played by conventional and ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration in the diagnosis of suspected hilar and mediastinal TB adenopathy. Finally, we assessed the role of the bronchoscopic therapy in the treatment of endobronchial TB and its complications, focusing on dilation techniques (such as balloon dilation and airway stenting) and ablative procedures (both heat and <b>cold</b> <b>therapies).</b> Keywords: Bronchoscopy, Tuberculosis, Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration, Tracheobronchial stenosi...|$|R
