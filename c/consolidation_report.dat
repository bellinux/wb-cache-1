In each test a 1 m long bundle of fuel rods plus a silver indium cadmium control rod was heated to an advanced state of degradation in the Phebus reactor, and the materials released were swept by an injected steam flow through a model circuit {{and into a}} miniature containment vessel.

This is evident with the increasing number of the Indonesian banking companies which have been taken over by foreign institutions; for instance the acquisition of PT. Bank Internasional Indonesia by Maybank. A Financial report is a tool for analyzing the development of the bank 2 ̆ 7 s performance of pre and post-acquisition. This {{can be explained by the}} financial performance in the period of 2005 to 2012. This study uses the ratios on CAMEL method, in capital it use CAR, in quality of the assets it uses AQ Ratio, in Management it uses NPM, for earnings ratio uses ROA and OEOI, and for the liquidity ratio uses LDR. The secondary data is gathered from the Indonesian Stock Exchange (IDX) and Publication Financial <b>Consolidation</b> <b>report</b> from the BII website. Results of statistical tests uses Paired Sample T-tests which concludes that the Financial Performance BII Maybank of the pre-acquisition was better than that of the post-acquisition. Accordingly, the financial performance of PT. Bank Internasional Indonesia Tbk. has no significant difference between pre and post-acquisition. Acquisition activity in the BII Maybank takes more than a 4 -year period after the acquisition to yield better results using CAMEL ratio or other financial methods. This study suggests that the financial performance of BII Maybank is affected by their acquisition activity, although the result of post-acquisition is not much better than post-acquisition.

40|$|This {{report is}} {{one of a number of}} reports that will be {{combined}} into a handbook on beryllium. Each report covers a specific topic. To-date, the following reports have been published: (1) Consolidation and Grades of Beryllium; (2) Mechanical Properties of Beryllium and the Factors Affecting these Properties; (3) Corrosion and Corrosion Protection of Beryllium; (4) Joining of Beryllium; (5) Atomic, Crystal, Elastic, Thermal, Nuclear, and other Properties of Beryllium; and (6) Beryllium Coating (Deposition) Processes and the Influence of Processing Parameters on Properties and Microstructure. The conventional method of using ingot-cast material is unsuitable for manufacturing a beryllium product. Beryllium is a highly reactive metal with a high melting point, making it susceptible to react with mold-wall materials forming beryllium compounds (BeO, etc.) that become entrapped in the solidified metal. In addition, the grain size is excessively large, being 50 to 100 {micro}m in diameter, while grain sizes of 15 {micro}m or less are required to meet acceptable strength and ductility requirements. Attempts at refining the as-cast-grain size have been unsuccessful. Because of the large grain size and limited slip systems, the casting will invariably crack during a hot-working step, which is an important step in the microstructural-refining process. The high reactivity of beryllium together with its high viscosity (even with substantial superheat) also makes it an unsuitable candidate for precision casting. In order to overcome these problems, alternative methods have been developed for the manufacturing of beryllium. The vast majority of these methods involve the use of beryllium powders. The powders are consolidated under pressure in vacuum at an elevated temperature to produce vacuum hot-pressed (VHP) blocks and vacuum hot-isostatic-pressed (HIP) forms and billets. The blocks (typically cylindrical), which are produced over a wide range of sizes (up to 183 cm dia. by 61 cm high), may be cut or machined into parts or be thermomechanically processed to develop the desired microstructure, properties, and shapes. Vacuum hot-isostatic pressing and cold-isostatic pressing (CIP) followed by sintering and possibly by a final HIP'ing (CIP/Sinter/HIP) are important in their use for the production of near net-shaped parts. For the same starting powder, a HIP'ed product will have less anisotropy than that obtained for a VHP'ed product. A schematic presentation illustrating the difference between VHP'ing and HIP'ing is shown in Figure I- 1. The types of powders and the various beryllium grades produced from the consolidated powders and their ambient-temperature mechanical properties were presented in the <b>consolidation</b> <b>report</b> referred to above. Elevated-temperature properties and the effect of processing variables on mechanical properties are described in the mechanical properties report. Beryllium can also be deposited as coatings as well as freestanding forms. The microstructure, properties, and various methods used that are related to the deposition of beryllium are discussed in the report on beryllium coatings...|$|E

GEC favours forging a national 'champion' defence group with BAe {{to compete with the}} giant US organisations." [...] When GEC put MES up for sale on 22 December 1998, BAE abandoned the DASA merger in favour of purchasing its British rival. The merger of British Aerospace and MES was announced on 19 January 1999. Evans stated that in 2004 that his fear was that an American defence contractor would acquire MES and challenge both British Aerospace and DASA. The merger created a vertically integrated company which The Scotsman described as [...] "combination of British Aerospace's contracting and platform-building skills with Marconi's coveted electronics systems capability". for example combining the manufacturer of the Eurofighter with the company that provided many of the aircraft's electronic systems; British Aerospace was MES' largest customer. In contrast, DASA's response to the breakdown of the merger discussion was to merge with Aérospatiale to create the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS), a horizontal integration. EADS has since considered a merger with Thales to create a [...] "fully rounded" [...] company.|$|R
