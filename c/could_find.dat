5|$|In 1960, Allan Williams, the Beatles manager, {{arranged}} {{a season of}} bookings in Hamburg, starting on 17 August 1960, but complained {{that they did not}} impress him, and hoped that he <b>could</b> <b>find</b> a better act.|$|E
5|$|Keynes {{was always}} {{confident}} he <b>could</b> <b>find</b> {{a solution to}} whatever problem {{he turned his attention}} to, and retained a lasting faith in the ability of government officials to do good.|$|E
5|$|Darlington's {{promotion}} campaign was dealt a blow in February 2009, when club chairman George Houghton placed {{the club in}} administration. As a result, the club were deducted 10points, a penalty from which they could not recover finally finishing 12th. Burgmeier finished with two goals during the season having played 35games, but {{like the rest of}} the playing squad, was told he <b>could</b> <b>find</b> a new club by Darlington's administrators.|$|E
60|$|He <b>could</b> not <b>find</b> one. Thank God that he <b>could</b> not <b>find</b> one! But {{after that}} dreadful thought had once crossed his mind, he must flee from that place ere the brand of Cain {{be on his}} brow.|$|R
25|$|The judge {{instructed}} {{the jury that}} they <b>could</b> not <b>find</b> Mrs Gough guilty of manslaughter, since only Mr Gough {{was strong enough to}} have inflicted the trauma which killed Dennis, but they <b>could</b> still <b>find</b> her guilty of neglect.|$|R

5|$|During {{a speech}} made by US President Barack Obama held at Georgia Tech in the McCamish Pavilion on March 10, 2015, the {{president}} jokingly {{indicated that he}} was supposed to be introduced by George P. Burdell, but no one <b>could</b> <b>find</b> George.|$|E
5|$|Stark {{began to}} move his force to Hog Island at about 10 am and {{directed}} most of his men to round up livestock there while he forded Crooked Creek to Noddle's Island {{with a group of}} thirty men. Stark's small contingent on Noddle's Island scattered into small groups, killed the animals they <b>could</b> <b>find,</b> and set fire to haystacks and barns.|$|E
5|$|The World Festival of Art and Entertainment at Expo 67 {{featured}} art galleries, opera, {{ballet and}} theatre companies, orchestras, jazz groups, famous Canadian pop musicians and other cultural attractions. Many pavilions had music and performance stages, where visitors <b>could</b> <b>find</b> free concerts and shows. Most of the featured entertainment {{took place in}} the following venues: Place des Arts, Expo Theatre, Place des Nations, La Ronde, and Automotive Stadium.|$|E

50|$|In {{application}} to the facts, Haldane <b>could</b> not <b>find</b> any consideration between Dunlop and Selfridge, nor <b>could</b> he <b>find</b> any indication of an agency relationship between Dew and Selfridge, for which separate consideration from that paid contractually by Selfridge to Dew would need to have been found. Consequently, Dunlop's action must fail.|$|R
50|$|After {{graduating in}} 1927, Péter <b>could</b> not <b>find</b> a {{permanent}} teaching position {{although she had}} passed her exams to qualify as a mathematics teacher. Due {{to the effects of}} the Great Depression, many university graduates <b>could</b> not <b>find</b> work and Péter began private tutoring. At this time, she also began her graduate studies.|$|R
5|$|The {{film was}} shot in Bagnoregio, Viterbo, Lazio, and Ovindoli, L'Aquila, Abruzzo. On Sundays, Fellini and Basehart would drive around the countryside, {{scouting}} locations and looking {{for just the right}} place to eat, sometimes trying as many as six restaurants and venturing as far away as Rimini before Fellini <b>could</b> <b>find</b> the desired ambience and menu.|$|E
5|$|The legislature, at Tillman's recommendation, reapportioned itself, costing Charleston County {{four of its}} twelve seats, {{and other}} lowcountry {{counties}} one each, with the seats going to the upcountry. Although Tillman sought to reduce public expenditures, he was not successful in doing so as his reform program required spending, and the legislature <b>could</b> <b>find</b> few savings to make. Construction of Clemson College was slowed, and subsidies for fairs were cut.|$|E
5|$|The sheriff, Teller, {{was named}} after Teller from the {{illusion}} and comedy duo Penn and Teller. The pair had wanted to appear on an episode of the show, but when Chris Carter <b>could</b> <b>find</b> no way to work them into the show this reference was added instead. The Astadourian Lightning Observatory {{was named after}} Mary Astadourian, Chris Carter's executive assistant. Darin Oswald was named after writer Darin Morgan.|$|E

5|$|A recent phenomenon, the {{migration}} of rural Chinese workers began in 1984 when the Regulations of Permanent Residence Registration became less punitive and allowed people to move to find employment. People left rural areas to escape poverty, and females left {{due to the lack}} of local opportunities for women. In the cities, women <b>could</b> <b>find</b> new, low-paid factory-based jobs that did not require highly skilled workers. According to national statistics, the ratio of male to female migrant workers averages 2:1, and an estimated 30-40 million of the migrant women work in the cities, namely Hong Kong and Shenzhen.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} {{casualties}} on 1 February 1741 in Pati, Chinese insurgents spread through central Java, joining {{forces with the}} Javanese while staging sham battles to convince the Dutch that the Javanese were supporting them. As the deception became increasingly obvious and the Chinese drew closer to Semarang, Visscher became mentally unstable. After capturing Rembang, Tanjung, and Jepara, the joint Chinese and Javanese army besieged Semarang in June 1741. In response, Visscher issued an order to eliminate all Chinese in Java. Prince Cakraningrat IV of Madura offered his alliance, and worked from Madura westward, killing any Chinese he and his troops <b>could</b> <b>find</b> and quashing the rebellion in eastern Java.|$|E
5|$|Another legend is that once, while Vishnu and Brahma contested for superiority, Shiva {{appeared}} as a flame, and challenged them to find his source. Brahma {{took the form of}} a swan, and flew to the sky to see the top of the flame, while Vishnu became the boar Varaha, and sought its base. The scene is called lingothbava, and is represented in the western wall at the sanctum of most Shiva temples. Neither Brahma nor Vishnu <b>could</b> <b>find</b> the source, and while Vishnu conceded his defeat, Brahma lied and said he had found the pinnacle. In punishment, Shiva ordained that Brahma would never have temples on earth in his worship.|$|E
60|$|After Maria was gone, {{the boys}} {{looked around the}} shop, but <b>could</b> not <b>find</b> any thing which exactly pleased them; {{or at least they}} <b>could</b> not <b>find</b> any thing which pleased them so much more than any thing else, that they could decide in favor of it. So they {{concluded}} to walk along, and look at another shop.|$|R
60|$|In a word, {{they saw}} plainly {{there was nothing}} to be done where we were without shipping; that if our {{business}} indeed was only to eat and drink, we <b>could</b> not <b>find</b> a better place in the world; but if our business was to get away, and get home into our country, we <b>could</b> not <b>find</b> a worse.|$|R

5|$|As {{the city}} grew, the hotels {{reflected}} ambitions {{of the strong}} economy, {{as evidenced by the}} eleven-story skyscraper Lamar Hotel built in 1927. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, the Lamar Hotel was adapted for use as a county annex building. In 1988 it was listed as a Mississippi Landmark. The E.F. Young Hotel was built in 1931. A staple in the African-American business district that developed west of the city's core, the hotel was one of the only places in the city during the years of segregation where a traveling African American <b>could</b> <b>find</b> a room.|$|E
5|$|Barrett {{made his}} first {{appearance}} of 2010–11 in the second match, starting in a 0–0 draw away to Grimsby Town on 17 August 2010. He scored his first goal {{of the season with}} an effort from six yards out to score the final goal in a 4–0 victory away to Rushden & Diamonds on 20 November 2010. He finished the season with 25 appearances and two goals before being released on 23 June 2011 after being told he <b>could</b> <b>find</b> another club.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{complexity}} of the crown, Goin and colleagues identified the tooth as a mammal; although some non-mammalian groups, like crocodylians, may have complex teeth, none approach the level of complexity seen in LACM 149371. They <b>could</b> <b>find</b> no resemblance to australosphenidans including monotremes, metatherians including marsupials, xenarthrans, and some related groups. They did see some general resemblances to the upper premolars of the early South American ungulates, but the cusp arrangement is different from that of any ungulate. There are also some resemblances to the early rodents Ivanantonia from Asia and Nonomys from North America, but Ivanantonia has a central groove and lacks fossae, and Nonomys has a prominent cingulum (shelf) {{at the edges of the}} tooth and also lacks the fossae of LACM 149371.|$|E

5|$|By 14 August Ohio {{was stopped}} with {{no hope of}} getting her engines going {{as she had been}} hit again whilst in tow of Penn. As Ledbury {{approached}} the estimated position of the tanker, the destroyer <b>could</b> <b>find</b> no sign of her. A little later, Commander Hill sighted gunfire ahead, and considering it to be Ohios escorts beating off reconnaissance snoops, the destroyer turned course towards the flashes on the horizon. As Ledbury approached Ohio, it was seen that the tanker was lying deep in the water, with a bent line of deck. Here, Hill turned towards his number one and said ' It looks as though we're too late '.|$|E
5|$|By this time, however, North Korean {{logistics}} {{had been}} stretched to their limit, and resupply became increasingly difficult. By {{the beginning of}} August, the North Korean units operating in the area were getting little to no food and ammunition supply, instead relying on captured UN weapons and foraging for what they <b>could</b> <b>find.</b> They were also exhausted from over a month of advancing, though morale remained high among the 766th troops. The 766th Regiment specialized in raiding UN supply lines, and effectively mounted small disruptive attacks against UN targets to equip themselves.|$|E
5|$|Chapman's playing {{career was}} that of a typical journeyman, owing mostly to the fact he often played as an amateur; this meant that whether he could play for a {{particular}} club was dictated by whether he <b>could</b> <b>find</b> an appropriate job nearby. He first played as a youth for his local side, Kiveton Park Colliery, before leaving home in 1895. He moved to Ashton-under-Lyne and played as an amateur for Ashton North End, before moving on to Stalybridge Rovers and then Rochdale (not {{to be confused with the}} modern-day Rochdale A.F.C.) – all three clubs being members of the Lancashire League. Chapman played at inside right, and although he lacked the skill of his brother Harry, he compensated for it with his strength and robustness.|$|E
