No one is better than any one else. What an incredible day for California AND for equality." [...] Lovato later said: [...] "I believe in gay marriage, I believe in equality. I think there's a lot of hypocrisy with religion. But I just found that you <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> own relationship with God, and I {{still have a lot}} of faith." ...|$|E

I wanted {{to show that you}} can have a child and you can work hard and you can get your body back. I know that there's so many women that feel the same thing after they give birth. You <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> child and you can still have fun and still be sexy and still have dreams and still live for yourself. I'm not embarrassed about it, and I don't feel like I have to protect that side of me because I do believe that {{sexuality}} is a power we all have." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{review in}} Publishers Weekly called the book an [...] "exuberant parade of pork fat", and commented, [...] "there's plenty {{good to be}} had in these pages". Writing for Library Journal, Judith Sutton concluded, [...] "There are, in fact, several other cookbooks devoted to bacon, {{including}} Sara Perry's Everything Tastes Better with Bacon, but with its irresistible recipes and wealth of information and lore, Villas's new title is recommended for most collections." [...] Amy Culbertson of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram also compared the Villas's work to another book on bacon, writing, [...] "His is a more definitive cookbook than last year's [...] "Seduced by Bacon" [...] by Joanna Pruess". The book was highlighted in the [...] "Holiday Cookbook Roundup: Gift Guide" [...] column of The Austin Chronicle, where writer Mick Vann concluded, [...] "This {{is one of the}} few cookbooks you'll find where every single recipe makes you want to head straight for the stove, whether it's a bacon, goat cheese, and sweet-onion pie; Russian borscht; beef-stuffed plantains; or braised Japanese pork belly. For those fellow bacon lovers in our midst, Villas' The Bacon Cookbook is required reading." [...] In honor of International Bacon Day in 2009, the National Pork Board offered recipes from The Bacon Cookbook. Bonnie Stern of Financial Post recommended the book, and commented, [...] "Few of us can resist the allure of sizzling, smokey, crispy bacon. Though not usually high on the list of foods that are considered good for you, if you don't eat it often, you <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> bacon and eat it, too. If you want to know all about bacon, have a look at The Bacon Cookbook by James Villas".|$|E

2500|$|In 2015, a Tumblr post from user virjn {{generated}} media controversy, as it claimed Green is [...] "a creep who panders to {{teenage girls}} {{so that he}} can amass some weird cult-like following." [...] Other users commented on the post, criticizing his writing and tagging Green to bring the post to his attention. Green responded to the post, defending himself, stating, [...] "Throwing that kind of accusation around is sick and libelous and most importantly damages the discourse around the actual sexual abuse of children." [...] Green added that he would use the social media website less often, stating, [...] "I'm not angry or anything like that. I just need some distance for my well-being." [...] Fellow young-adult authors, Rainbow Rowell and Maggie Stiefvater came to Green's defense. Stiefvater wrote on Tumblr, [...] "You <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> own opinions on Green's books and Internet presence, {{but the fact remains that}} he is a very real positive influence on thousands of teens. You're not just making sure you can't have nice things. You're taking away other people's nice things." [...] In a subsequent email to USA Today, Stiefvater stated, [...] "I had to say something. Not because of the nature of the posts, although they were distasteful and borderline libel. But because the grotesquerie was being force-fed to the author." ...|$|E

50|$|Smirks against Travolta {{was only}} {{one example of the}} band's use of parody, though the {{campaign}} had a serious side: keeping live music venues alive against the increasing incidence of discos with only recorded music.
