40|$|International audienceTrees are {{classical}} {{representations of}} hierarchical structures in symbolic music, in particular for rhythm notations, where the durations {{are defined by}} a hierarchy of subdivisions. Structures called rhythm trees have been integrated since a long time into <b>Computer</b> <b>Aided</b> <b>Composition</b> environments such as Patchwork and OpenMusic, for programming rhythmic objects. Term rewriting and tree automata and transducers are well established formalisms for transforming and reasoning on trees. With solid theoretical foundations, they are used {{in a wide range}} of applications including automatic reasoning, natural language processing, and foundations of web data processing. In this work, we consider a tree structured representation of rhythm suitable for defining a set of rewrite rules (i. e. oriented equations) preserving rhythms, while enabling the simplification of notations.

40|$|There {{are many}} ways to realize <b>computer</b> <b>aided</b> <b>compositions</b> in architecture. In the past, many of the design methods could be {{characterized}} as Cartesian design methods, e. g. Christopher Alexander's well- known hierarchical design method presented in the early sixties. Recently, methods of artificial intelligence increased flexibility in searching for design solutions, but all these methods were still restricted by the program's logic itself. What is lacking is a means of realizing artistic possibilities intended by the designer. In view of this situation, a new approach called “media experimental design work” seems to meet designer's need. This paper begins by looking in general at experimental work in architectural design. Discussion of the theoretical background is then followed by some examples of media experimental design work, one of the current research topics in <b>computer</b> <b>aided</b> architectural design at the University of Kaiserslautern. The idea of this approach is to explore design solutions by experimental use of certain media which can evoke design associations and possibly stimulate the designer's inspirations. The use of sophisticated techniques together with the possibility of extensive manipulations can help to find outstanding design solutions. In view of their imaginative and creative power, digital media have a greater stimulating potential than traditional media in experimental design work...|$|R
40|$|PatchWork (PW), (Laurson, 1996 a), is {{a visual}} {{programming}} language which has a direct correspondence to its base languages Common Lisp and CLOS.

Systems for <b>computer</b> <b>aided</b> <b>composition</b> {{are becoming more and more}} common, either to evaluate music created by humans, or as generators of raw material to be used by composers. This Master s Thesis describes a novel implementation of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, that is capable of generating short musical ideas consisting of a melody and abstract harmonization. The implementation is capable of creating these ideas based on provided material, or autonomously. Three automated fitness features were adapted to the model to evaluate the generated music during evolution, and a fourth was developed for ensuring harmonic progression. Four rhythmical pattern matching features were also developed. The implementation produced 21 pieces of music, under various configurations, that were evaluated in a study. The results of this study indicates that the system is capable of composing ideas that are subjectively interesting and pleasant, but not consistently...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{variable}} neighbourhood search (VNS) algorithm is developed that can generate musical fragments of arbitrary length {{consisting of a}} cantus firmus and a first species counterpoint melody. The objective function of the algorithm {{is based on a}} quantification of existing counterpoint rules. The VNS algorithm developed in this paper is a local search algorithm that starts from a randomly generated melody and improves it by changing one or two notes at a time. A thorough parametric analysis of the VNS reveals the significance of the algorithm’s parameters {{on the quality of the}} composed fragment, as well as their optimal settings. The VNS algorithm has been implemented in a user-friendly software environment for composition, called Optimuse. Optimuse allows a user to specify a number of characteristics such as length, key, and mode. Based on this information, Optimuse “composes” both a cantus firmus and a first species counterpoint melody. Alternatively, the user may specify a cantus firmus, and let Optimuse compose only an accompanying first species counterpoint melody.

The implementation of this decomposition theorem in a <b>computer</b> <b>aided</b> music <b>composition</b> language, as OpenMusic [1], enables to easily verify if a given periodic sequence is reducible or reproducible. In this special case, one of the two factors will be identically zero. This means that every periodic sequence has in itself a certain degree of reducibility and reproducibility. We also suggest how to use this result in order to explain some regularities of distribution of numerical values {{in the case of the}} finite addition process and how to generalize the decomposition theorem by means of the Fitting Lemma.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{question}} of music modeling and generation, capturing the idiomatic {{style of a}} composer or a genre, {{in an attempt to}} provide the computer with “creative”, human-like capabilities. The system described in the paper performs analyses of musical sequences and computes a model according to which new interpretations / improvisations close to the original's style can be generated. Important aspects of the musical structure are captured, including rhythm, melodic contour, and polyphonic relationships. Two statistical learning methods are implemented and their performance is compared in the paper: The first method is based on “Universal Prediction”, a method derived from Information Theory and previously shown to be useful for statistical modeling in the musical domain. The second method is an application to music of Prediction Suffix Trees (PST), a learning technique initially developed for statistical modeling of complex sequences with applications in Linguistics and Computational Biology. Both methods provide a stochastic representation of musical style and are able to capture musical structures of variable lengths, from short ornamentations to complete musical phrases.

This {{can be done by}} realizing that composing music can—at least partially—be regarded as a combinatorial optimization problem, in which one or more melodies are “optimized ” to fit the “rules ” of their specific mu-sical style. In a previous paper, a variable neighbourhood search (VNS) algorithm was developed that could generate first and fifth species counterpoint fragments based on an objective function that was manually coded from music theory [5]. In this research machine learning is used to automatically generate the objective function for a VNS that generates first species counterpoint. When composing or generating counterpoint fragments, it is essential to con-sider both vertical (harmonic) and horizontal (melodic) aspects. These two di-mensions should be linked instead of treated separately. Furthermore, in order to confront the data sparsity issue in any corpus, abstract representations should be used instead of surface representations. These representational issues are handled by the vertical viewpoints method [1, 3]. A first species counterpoint fragment can be viewed a sequence of dyads (two simultaneous pitches). Every dyad is represented by three linked features: two pitch intervals between the two melodic lines (previous and next dyad), and the feature sequences with the vertical viewpoint method [1] and a first order Markov model is constructed. A total of 1000 first species fragments were used as training data for the Markov model. They were generated by the approach described by Herremans and Sörensen [4]. To generate counterpoint, the VNS algorithm receives a cantus firmus as in-put (composed by the user or automatically [4]) and generates the corresponding counterpoint line. The quality of a counterpoint fragment is evaluated accordin...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to give the reader a concise {{overview}} of Expressive Notation Package 2. 0 (henceforward ENP). ENP is music notation program that belongs to a family of music and sound related software packages developed at Sibelius Academy in Finland. ENP has been used in various research projects during the past several years. 1. OVERVIEW ENP [3] is a music notation program that has been developed in order to meet the requirements of <b>computer</b> <b>aided</b> <b>composition,</b> music analysis and virtual instrument control. ENP is intended to represent Western musical notation from 17 th century onward including 20 th century notation. ENP is not a full featured music typesetting program. It is, however, designed to produce automatic, reasonable musical typesetting according to the common practices [12]. ENP output should not generally require adjustments made by the user. There are also some other non-commercial LISP-based programs that are aimed at representing complex musical data such as Common Music Notation [13], PatchWork’s Rhythm-Editor [6] and the musical editors in OpenMusic [1]. ENP is programmed with LispWorks ANSI Common Lisp by Xanalys. LispWorks, in turn, is a Lisp implementation that is source code compatible across Windows, Linux, Mac OS X and UNIX platforms. ENP uses the OpenGL API for graphical output. OpenGL is a widely used 3 D graphics library that is fast and portable with implementations in all of the aforementioned operating systems. It is equally suitable for developing 2 D or 3 D interactive applications. At the time of writing the development version of ENP runs in Mac OS X. However, some preliminary attempts have been made to port it to Windows. Some of the key concepts behind ENP are: 1) ENP can be used to represent a wide range of notational styles.
