40|$|AbstractIn {{pavement}} engineering a crude uniform <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> over {{a circular}} contact area {{is used to}} generate key strains for an analytical design method. The use of a more advanced tyre <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> measurement device {{has led to a}} situation where there is more information that is available to generate a more accurate uniform representation of <b>contact</b> <b>pressure.</b> This measurement device also offers the ability to measure non-uniform 3 -D tyre <b>contact</b> <b>pressure.</b> That is to say the vertical, transverse and longitudinal components of pressure generated by a tyre in contact with a pavement. A comparison of the key strains generated by this improved uniform <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> representation and the measured 3 -D <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> is of great interest. Of course a tyre does not display the same <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> for different combinations of axle loading and inflation pressure. The combination of these two factors greatly affects the nature of the <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> observed. A finite element mesh of a 3 -layer thin pavement structure was created in CAPA- 3 D. This was used to model the uniform and 3 -D <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> representations of a wide based tyre. This was done for 3 inflation pressures and 3 tyre loads. The inflation pressures were for a recommended inflation pressure and then plus and minus 200 kPa. The tyre loading was for a maximum European axle loading and then greater and lower than this value. This gave a good spread of conditions that are relevant to the tyre operating conditions. The key strains at different locations in the pavement relevant to the major distresses of a pavement were assessed. The main distress mechanisms being top down cracking, asphalt cracking/rutting, traditional bottom up cracking and subgrade rutting. These gave a good spread of possible distresses that tyre <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> can contribute to. The results showed that there was a large effect on surface strains caused by 3 -D <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> in comparison to uniform <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> for all combinations of inflation pressure and tyre loading. The difference between the two <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> representations diminished with depth in the pavement. Therefore, it was clear that 3 -D <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> has an effect on the distress of a pavement surface. This means to accurately understand the deterioration of a pavement surface, 3 -D <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> must be considered. In the case of the other distresses the uniform <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> generated greater strains and would give a conservative pavement design. Both methods generated greatly different key strains depending on the combination of inflation pressure and tyre loading. If a complex highly accurate analysis is required, then a fully 3 -D representation in combination with finite element analysis is the best option. However, if a more routine analysis is required then the improved uniform <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> representation could be used with a simple modelling tool (e. g. BISAR) to get good results for a traditional analytical design...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFretting fatigue {{fractures}} {{of industrial}} machines often {{occur at the}} point where high <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> occurs due to uneven contact. In this study, fretting fatigue tests were performed under high <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> applied in line-contact conditions using 12 % Cr steel with parameters of the mean stress, <b>contact</b> <b>pressure,</b> and material strength. The fretting fatigue strength was shown to decrease as <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> increased, and minimized when Hertz’s average <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> was about 1. 5 times 0. 2 % proof stress σ 0. 2, and increased again at higher <b>contact</b> <b>pressure.</b> Crack propagation behavior was examined using fracture mechanics by observing the detailed crack propagation profile of non-propagating cracks and performing finite element analysis with an inclined elliptical surface crack. Cracks were found to propagate in stage II at the angle where the maximum stress intensity factor range ΔKθmax occurred. Also, test results concerning the fretting fatigue strength could be successfully explained by the micro-crack propagation model in which a micro-crack can propagate when its stress intensity factor range ΔK is greater than the threshold value ΔKth when considering small crack effects and mean stress effects. This model also confirmed the experimental results that showed the length of non-propagating cracks decreased as the mean stress and the material strength increased...|$|R
40|$|Seung-Kook Ro* In this paper, the <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> of the wafer and {{polishing}} pad for final polishing process for 300 mm-wafer were investigated through numerical analysis using FEM tool, ANSYS. The {{distribution of the}} <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> is one of main parameters which affects on the flatness and surface roughness of polished wafers. Two types of polishing head, a hard type head with ceramic disk and a soft type head with air bag were considered. The effects of the deformation and initial shape of table on the <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> were also examined. Both heads and tables were modeled as 3 D finite element model from solid model, and the material properties of polishing pads and rubber plate for the air-bag head were obtained from tensile tests. The <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> deviation on wafer surface was smaller with air bag head than hard type head even when the table had form errors such as convex or concave. From this 3 D analysis, it could be concluded that the air-bag head has better uniformity of the <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> on wafer. Also, the effects of inner diameter of air bag and radial clearance between wafer and retainer were investigated as view point of <b>contact</b> <b>pressure</b> concentration {{on the edge of}} wafer...|$|R
