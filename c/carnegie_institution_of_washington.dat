5|$|Calakmul {{was first}} {{reported}} by Cyrus Lundell in 1931. A year later he informed Sylvanus Morley of the site's existence {{and the presence}} of more than 60 stelae. Morley visited the ruins himself on behalf of the <b>Carnegie</b> <b>Institution</b> <b>of</b> <b>Washington</b> in 1932. In the 1930s surveys mapped the site core and recorded 103 stelae. Investigations stopped in 1938 and archaeologists did not return to the site until 1982 when William J. Folan directed a project on behalf of the Universidad Autónoma de Campeche, working at Calakmul until 1994. Calakmul is now the subject of a large-scale project of the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) under the direction of Ramón Carrasco.|$|E
5|$|German {{geographer}} Karl Sapper {{visited the}} ruins in 1896 and published {{a brief description}} of the ruins together with a site map two years later in a 6-page pamphlet by the Internationales Archiv für Ethnographie of Leyden in the Netherlands, entitled Die Ruinen von Mixco, Guatemala. It was Sapper who labelled each of the archaeological groups and their attendant structures. American archaeologist A. Ledyard Smith visited the ruins in 1949 and wrote a chapter about the site in his Archaeological Reconnaissance in Central America, published by the <b>Carnegie</b> <b>Institution</b> <b>of</b> <b>Washington</b> in 1955. Archeological excavations were carried out from 1954 through 1967 by the Musée de l'Homme of Paris under the direction of archaeologist Henri Lehmann, who certainly believed that he was excavating the Pocomam capital as described in Colonial records.|$|E

5|$|In May 1938, Bush {{accepted}} a prestigious appointment {{as president of}} the <b>Carnegie</b> <b>Institution</b> <b>of</b> <b>Washington</b> (CIW), which had been founded in Washington, D.C. Also known as the Carnegie Institution for Science, it had an endowment of $33 million, and annually spent $1.5 million in research, most of which was carried out at its eight major laboratories. Bush became its president on January 1, 1939, with a salary of $25,000. He was now able to influence research policy in the United States at the highest level, and could informally advise the government on scientific matters. Bush soon discovered that the CIW had serious financial problems, and he had to ask the Carnegie Corporation for additional funding.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt {{decided that}} the letter {{required}} action, and authorized {{the creation of the}} Advisory Committee on Uranium. The committee was chaired by Lyman James Briggs, the Director of the Bureau of Standards (currently the National Institute of Standards and Technology), with Adamson and Hoover as its other members. It convened {{for the first time on}} October 21. The meeting was also attended by Fred L. Mohler from the Bureau of Standards, Richard B. Roberts of the <b>Carnegie</b> <b>Institution</b> <b>of</b> <b>Washington,</b> and Szilárd, Teller and Wigner. Adamson was skeptical about the prospect of building an atomic bomb, but was willing to authorize $6,000 ($100,000 in current USD) for the purchase of uranium and graphite for Szilárd and Fermi's experiment.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientists}} at Columbia {{decided that they}} should try to detect the energy released in the nuclear fission of uranium when bombarded by neutrons. On 25 January 1939, {{in the basement of}} Pupin Hall at Columbia, an experimental team including Fermi conducted the first nuclear fission experiment in the United States. The other members of the team were Herbert L. Anderson, Eugene T. Booth, John R. Dunning, G. Norris Glasoe, and Francis G. Slack. The next day, the Fifth Washington Conference on Theoretical Physics began in Washington, D.C. under the joint auspices of George Washington University and the <b>Carnegie</b> <b>Institution</b> <b>of</b> <b>Washington.</b> There, the news on nuclear fission was spread even further, which fostered many more experimental demonstrations.|$|E

5|$|From 1947 to 1962, Bush was on {{the board}} of {{directors}} for American Telephone and Telegraph.

Bush became chairman of the board at Merck following the death of George W. Merck, serving until 1962. He worked closely with the company's president, Max Tishler, although Bush was concerned about Tishler's reluctance to delegate responsibility. Bush distrusted the company's sales organization, but supported Tishler's research and development efforts.

25|$|In 2002, {{scientists}} at the <b>Carnegie</b> <b>Institution</b> <b>of</b> <b>Washington</b> examined the pressure limits of life processes. Solutions of bacteria, specifically Escherichia coli and Shewanella oneidensis, {{were placed in the}} DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 GPa, which is more than 16,000 times Earth's surface pressure (985 hPa). After 30 hours, only about 1% of the bacteria survived. The experimenters then added a dye to the solution. If the cells survived the squeezing and were capable of carrying out life processes, specifically breaking down formate, the dye would turn clear. 1.6 GPa is such great pressure that during the experiment the DAC turned the solution into ice-IV, a room-temperature ice. When the bacteria broke down the formate in the ice, liquid pockets would form because of the chemical reaction. The bacteria were also able to cling {{to the surface of the}} DAC with their tails.|$|E

As a youth, Mauchly was interested in science, and in particular with electricity, and as a young teenager was known to fix neighbors' electric systems. Mauchly attended E.V. Brown Elementary School in Chevy Chase and McKinley Technical High School in Washington, DC. At McKinley, Mauchly was extremely active in the debate team, {{was a member of the}} national honor society, and became editor-in-chief of the school's newspaper, Tech Life.
