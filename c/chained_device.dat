40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that giant current and high spin rectification ratios {{can be achieved}} in atomic carbon <b>chain</b> <b>devices</b> connected between two symmetric ferromagnetic zigzag-graphene-nanoribbon electrodes. The spin dependent transport simulation is carried out by density functional theory combined with the non-equilibrium Green's function method. It is found that the transverse symmetries of the electronic wave functions in the nanoribbons and the carbon chain are critical to the spin transport modes. In the parallel magnetization configuration of two electrodes, pure spin current is observed in both linear and nonlinear regions. However, in the antiparallel configuration, the spin-up (down) current is prohibited under the positive (negative) voltage bias, which results in a spin rectification ratio of order 104. When edge carbon atoms are substituted with boron atoms to suppress the edge magnetization {{in one of the}} electrodes, we obtain a diode with current rectification ratio over 10 e 6...|$|R

40|$|Since its {{invention}} in 1948, the transistor has revolutionized {{our everyday}} life - transistor radios and TV's {{appeared in the}} early 1960 s, personal computers came into widespread use in the mid- 1980 s, and cellular phones, laptops, and palm-sized organizers dominated the 1990 s. The electronics revolution is based upon transistor miniaturization; smaller transistors are faster, and denser circuitry has more functionality. Transistors in current generation chips are 0. 25 micron or 250 nanometers in size, and the electronics industry has completed development of 0. 18 micron transistors which will enter production {{within the next few}} years. Industry researchers are now working to reduce transistor size down to 0. 13 micron - a thousandth of the width of a human hair. However, studies indicate that the miniaturization of silicon transistors will soon reach its limit. For further progress in microelectronics, scientists have turned to nanotechnology to advance the science. Rather than continuing to miniaturize transistors to a point where they become unreliable, nanotechnology offers the new approach of building devices on the atomic scale [see sidebar]. One vision {{for the next generation of}} miniature electronics is atomic <b>chain</b> electronics, where <b>devices</b> are composed of atoms aligned on top of a substrate surface in a regular pattern.

If the rewards are determined to outweigh the costs, then the individual is likely to enter an exchange relationship. Trust is critical for this process because it is believed to reduce the perceived costs of it. As we can see in [22], trends in persuasive computation are based on cultural and social knowledge.

40|$|Virtual Reality (VR) is {{a rapidly}} {{advancing}} scientific field which enables humans to experience environments {{other than that}} which they physically inhabit. Humans use all their senses to interact {{in the real world}} and there should be no difference when using VR. This thesis explores the current state-of-the-art in Multi-Sensory Virtual Reality (MSVR) and presents new techniques for improving the level of interaction and realism in touch enabled MSVR. It is shown that, of the three senses which are commonly included in MSVR: vision, audition and haptics (touch), haptics is the least well represented. Further, it is observed that haptic interaction is particularly lacking in two areas: natural object manipulation and large workspace interaction. Object manipulation is limited by the number of contact points a haptic device can provide and there are both hardware and software challenges related to this. It is also limited by the realism of simulated object motion which is more complex for haptics than purely visual-auditory simulations. A novel haptic rendering algorithm, called the xFCA, has been designed to improve multi-finger manipulation of arbitrarily shaped objects. Also, a software platform known as MUSI has been developed which integrates the xFCA into a dynamic rigid-body simulator to allow the natural manipulation of virtual objects. The challenges in the development of MUSI, along with its advantages and limitations are discussed. Two new approaches to increasing the workspace of haptic devices have been investigated. The first, a novel haptic rendering technique which provides force feedback related to velocity is applied to a virtual shopping trolley. The second, a novel method of <b>chaining</b> <b>devices</b> together, is used to create a multi-finger haptic interface for both large and fast movements. Finally, both systems have been integrated into an MSVR simulator and the results of this are also discussed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

A quarter of all children born each year are not immunized against common and preventable diseases during their first year of life [1]. By increasing vaccine delivery, a greater number of lives will be saved. The process to deliver these life saving vaccines is both a technological and logistical problem. Our project created a device that is able to keep vaccines, blood and test samples within the narrow temperature range of 2 o C to 8 o C. Functional Goal: The goal of our project is to create a backpack that is capable of accurately maintaining an internal temperature of 2 – 8 ° Celsius over the course of 3 hours. It will be used for the transportation of blood or vaccines and will that operate on minimal electrical energy. Current Cold <b>Chain</b> <b>Devices</b> • No regulation of temperature, which leaves vaccines vulnerable to temperatures outside the recommended range of 2 o C to 8 o C PoCo DeCo • Maintain temperature between the required range of 2 o C to 8 o C • Hands-free carrying with the added support of both a waist and chest strap Clinical Need In the current vaccine supply chain, the “cold chain”, passive temperature stabilization relies on insulated vaccine carriers storing ice packs, or cold boxes, but poor design often renders vaccines impotent due to freeze damage. Also, in developing countries there are similar difficulties maintaining the cold chain for blood and test samples.
