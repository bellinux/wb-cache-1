5|$|Among the locally {{produced}} yarns for Navajo textile, indiscriminate breeding from 1870-1890 {{caused a}} steady decline in wool quality. Increasing proportions of brittle kemp {{can be found}} in well-preserved examples from the period. In 1903, federal agents attempted to address the problem by introducing Rambouillet rams into the breeding population. The Rambouillet is a French breed that produces good meat and heavy, fine-wool fleeces. The Rambouillet stock were well adapted to the Southwestern climate, but their wool was less suitable to hand spinning. Short-stapled Rambouillet wool has a tight <b>crimp,</b> which makes hand spinning difficult. The higher lanolin content of its wool necessitated significantly more scouring with scarce water before it could be dyed effectively. From 1920 to 1940, when Rambouillet bloodlines dominated the tribe's stock, Navajo rugs have a characteristically curly wool and sometimes a knotted or lumpy appearance.|$|E

40|$|Generally, {{hand-operated}} and hydraulic compressors use <b>crimping</b> {{of connection}} terminals. However, this equipment often causes compressed defects because non-uniform pressure is {{applied in the}} circumferential direction of the terminal during <b>crimping.</b> A defective terminal often leads to fire in electric equipment due to overheating. Therefore, {{there is a need}} to develop a new <b>crimping</b> process for manufacturing highly durable terminals. MPC (magnetic pulse <b>crimping)</b> uses uniform electromagnetic pressure by a high magnetic field interaction between coil and terminal. This process uses only electromagnetic pressure for <b>crimping,</b> so the terminal can be <b>crimped</b> without physical contact, thereby producing a highly durable connection terminal. In this study, a MPC process was developed to fabricate a prototypical terminal. The result was compared with other <b>crimping</b> processes in terms of durability. The <b>crimped</b> part using MPC has a lower rising temperature and higher tensile strength than those using other <b>crimping</b> process. It is inferred from the experimental results that an optimal charging voltage exists in the MPC proces...|$|R

5|$|Breeds {{are often}} {{categorized}} by {{the type of}} their wool. Fine wool breeds are those that have wool of great <b>crimp</b> and density, which are preferred for textiles. Most of these were derived from Merino sheep, and the breed continues to dominate the world sheep industry. Downs breeds have wool between the extremes, and are typically fast-growing meat and ram breeds with dark faces. Some major medium wool breeds, such as the Corriedale, are dual-purpose crosses of long and fine-wooled breeds and were created for high-production commercial flocks. Long wool breeds are the largest of sheep, with long wool and a slow rate of growth. Long wool sheep are most valued for crossbreeding to improve the attributes of other sheep types. For example: the American Columbia breed was developed by crossing Lincoln rams (a long wool breed) with fine-wooled Rambouillet ewes.|$|E
5|$|The {{land where}} the Glidden House stands once held a log structure, which Glidden lived {{in when he}} first came to DeKalb at the beckoning of his cousin Russell Huntley. The house was built in 1861 for barbed wire {{entrepreneur}} Joseph Farwell Glidden. As his personal residence, the house, and its accompanying barn, were closely associated with his invention, really just an improvement, of barbed wire. Glidden's improvement upon a wire board fence developed by Henry Rose was of vast importance in the settlement of the United States west of the Mississippi. It was after Glidden saw Rose exhibit his wire at a fair in 1873 that he was struck with the idea of attaching barbs to wire strand fencing. Glidden is said to have experimented with some of his ideas in the basement kitchen of the Glidden House. He noticed that whenever he tried to attach s directly to strands of wire they slid {{along the length of the}} wire; Glidden realized he needed a way to <b>crimp</b> the barbs. He began tinkering around the home's kitchen. Glidden fit two hair pins to the shaft of a coffee mill, one centered and the other off-center. He found that by placing the wire between the pins and turning the crank a uniform barb resulted. How to <b>crimp</b> the barbs to the wire was solved, in the barn, by tying one end of the wire and another length of wire to a poplar tree on the grounds of the Glidden House and the other ends of the wires to a grindstone. The grindstone was used to twist the wires together and prevent the barbs from slipping.|$|E
5|$|Yet {{even as the}} Americans were {{attempting}} to clear the tunnels, heavy hand-to-hand fighting broke out above ground and Haldane was later awarded the Silver Star for his actions when he rushed a bunker while under fire armed only with a pistol, {{in order to give}} first aid to a number of wounded soldiers. His courage inspired his men to complete the assault, and ultimately helped ensure the successful evacuation of the casualties and the capture of their objective. That evening the battalions of US 3rd Infantry Brigade had completed searching their assigned area of operation, and the following morning they were withdrawn from the operation. The brigade's involvement in <b>Crimp</b> had been limited, losing six killed and 45 wounded, while 22 Viet Cong had been killed. It was subsequently redeployed on Operation Buckskin.|$|E

5|$|Brumfield {{considered}} Operation Hump to be {{the least}} successful operation in which the Australian battalion had participated, and he criticised it as being badly conceived from the start, and mounted with too little intelligence or prior reconnaissance. Indeed, from the initial landing zone being occupied by the Viet Cong, failures in the passage of information, the heavy losses suffered by the US 1/503rd Battalion and the subsequent difficulties with casualty evacuation, the operation had not run smoothly. The Australians were vengeful for their losses and wanted to return to collect their dead; however, with 1 RAR absorbed into other operations the planned battalion attack on Hill 82 never occurred. Regardless, further operations followed in the months afterwards, with 1 RAR subsequently employed on Operation New Life in November and December, and later Operation <b>Crimp</b> in the Ho Bo Woods in January 1966. Operation Hump was Brumfield's last, with an old football injury forcing his evacuation to Australia in mid-November. He was subsequently replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Alex Preece.|$|E
5|$|During the {{fighting}} the Australians had faced stiff resistance and had suffered eight killed and 29 wounded, while claiming 27 Viet Cong killed and a further 30 probably killed. The Americans {{had also been}} involved in heavy fighting and their casualties included 14 killed and 76 wounded. Total communist casualties included 128 confirmed killed, and another 190 probably killed, as well as 92 captured and another 509 suspects detained. In addition many more Viet Cong were thought likely to have perished in the tunnels as they were collapsed by charges laid by the Australian engineers. The Americans later claimed that {{the headquarters of the}} communist 4th Military Region had also been destroyed. Due to the quantity of information recovered from the thousands of captured documents alone, the battle was later described as the first allied strategic intelligence victory of the war. So significant was the find that both Westmoreland and General Joseph McChristian, the head of Intelligence at MACV, visited 1 RAR during Operation <b>Crimp.</b> Allied operations against the communist tunnels had been largely ad hoc, and the Australians began to develop the earliest techniques for exploring and destroying them. Later, at least partially {{as a result of the}} success of the Australians in clearing some of the shorter tunnels, American units adopted similar tactics and created a number of tunnel-clearance teams, known popularly as Tunnel Rats.|$|E
5|$|However, {{with the}} {{security}} situation in South Vietnam continuing to deteriorate, the US increased its involvement to 200,000 combat troops by early 1965. Australia also committed ground forces, dispatching the 1 RAR to serve with the US 173rd Airborne Brigade in Bien Hoa province in June 1965 and it subsequently fought {{a number of significant}} actions, including Gang Toi, Operation <b>Crimp</b> and Suoi Bong Trang. In March 1966, the Australian government announced the deployment of a brigade-sized unit—the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF)—to replace 1 RAR. Included were a large number of conscripts, under the increasingly controversial National Service Scheme. Consisting of two infantry battalions as well as armour, aviation, artillery and other support arms, the task force was assigned primary responsibility for its own area and was based at Nui Dat, in Phuoc Tuy Province. Included were the Iroquois helicopters of No. 9 Squadron RAAF. At the Battle of Long Tan on 18 August 1966, D Company, 6 RAR with considerable artillery support held off and defeated a Viet Cong force that was at least six times bigger than itself. 18 Australians were killed and 24 wounded, while 245 communist dead were later recovered from the battlefield. The battle allowed the Australians to gain dominance over Phuoc Tuy Province and 1 ATF was not fundamentally challenged again. Regardless, during February 1967 the Australians suffered their heaviest casualties in the war to that point, losing 16 men killed and 55 wounded in a single week, the bulk during Operation Bribie.|$|E

Roll crimps hold the bullet far more securely, and are preferred in situations, such as magnum revolvers, where recoil velocities are significant. A tight <b>crimp</b> also helps to delay the start of the bullet's motion, which can increase chamber pressures, and help develop full power from slower burning powders (see internal ballistics).|$|E

25|$|Despite this revamped {{effort at}} {{fighting}} the enemy {{on its own}} terms, U.S. operations remained insufficient at eliminating the tunnels completely.

40|$|OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Although in {{stapes surgery}} {{successful}} hearing improvement may {{be achieved in}} the majority of patients, unsatisfactory closure of the air-bone gap can be recorded. One of many reasons for unexpected failures of stapes surgery may be the insufficient <b>crimping</b> of a stapes prosthesis onto the incus. The objectives of the study were to assess the amount of sound transmission loss in response to the quality of prosthesis <b>crimping</b> and to identify a required loop attachment pattern to obtain good sound transmission results. STUDY DESIGN: Experimental. METHODS: A temporal bone model was developed to measure the sound transmission properties between incus and prosthesis on 17 fresh human temporal bones. The attachment of a titanium stapes piston was assessed without <b>crimping,</b> followed by loose <b>crimping</b> and tight fixation to the incus, using scanning laser Doppler interferometry, endoscopic photography, micro grinding technique, and scanning electron microscopy. An algorithm had to be developed to simulate acoustical stimulation using electromechanical stimulation. RESULTS: Optimal tight <b>crimping</b> of the stapes piston revealed consistent good sound transfer function ranging from 0 to 7 dB loss, and loss remained, on average, at 2 dB. The mean transmission losses for conditions of loose <b>crimping</b> and no <b>crimping</b> were surprisingly small (within 10 dB). However, these unusual <b>crimping</b> conditions allowed a wide range of losses up to 28 dB. A close coupling at least at two opposite points was obligatory to obtain consistently good results. CONCLUSIONS: Perfect hearing reconstruction necessitates ideal <b>crimping</b> of a prosthesis to obtain consistently good results. However, the final functional gain depends on many different intraoperative and postoperative factors...|$|R
40|$|Background Transcatheter {{aortic valve}} {{replacement}} {{has emerged as}} a promising therapy for treatment of severe aortic stenosis. Although {{it has been shown that}} these valves can be safely delivered and implanted, studies of valve longevity are lacking because of the infancy of the technology. Particularly, the effects of stent <b>crimping</b> on the valve's leaflets have not yet been sufficiently investigated. In this study, we have characterized the effects of <b>crimping</b> on pericardial leaflets in time and through the depth of the tissue. Methods To test the structural changes at the surface and deep layers of bovine pericardial leaflets, scanning electron microscopy and second-harmonic generation microscopy were used. An uncrimped tissue sample was imaged, followed by imaging a segment of tissue after <b>crimping</b> in a stented transcatheter valve, immediately after, at 20 minutes, and 60 minutes after <b>crimping.</b> The <b>crimping</b> experiment was performed for multiple <b>crimping</b> sizes (ie, 14 F, 16 F, and 18 F). We defined a damage index that quantifies the level of leaflet structural changes as a result of <b>crimping.</b> Results Based on the calculated damage indices and analyses of the raw images, it was determined that <b>crimping</b> does measurable damage to the leaflet tissue that persists with time. Conclusions Significant tissue damage was observed at the surface layers of the leaflets. In the deeper tissue layers, damage was substantial for 14 F crimping; however, it became less significant but still visible for larger collapse profiles. <b>Crimping</b> may induce substantial structural damage to pericardial leaflets that does not improve with time. © 2014 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons...|$|R

25|$|When alfalfa {{is to be}} used as hay, it {{is usually}} cut and baled. Loose haystacks are still used in some areas, but bales are easier for use in transportation, storage, and feed. Ideally, the first cutting should be taken at the bud stage, and the {{subsequent}} cuttings just as the field is beginning to flower, or one-tenth bloom because carbohydrates are at their highest. When using farm equipment rather than hand-harvesting, a swather cuts the alfalfa and arranges it in windrows. In areas where the alfalfa does not immediately dry out on its own, a machine known as a mower-conditioner is used to cut the hay. The mower-conditioner has a set of rollers or flails that <b>crimp</b> and break the stems as they pass through the mower, making the alfalfa dry faster. After the alfalfa has dried, a tractor pulling a baler collects the hay into bales.|$|E
25|$|Marraffino's design, {{which remains}} in use for single-color stripes, is simple. The main material, usually white, {{sits at the}} <b>crimp</b> end of the {{toothpaste}} tube and makes up most of its bulk. A thin pipe, through which that carrier material will flow, descends from the nozzle to it. The stripe-material (this was red in Stripe) fills {{the gap between the}} carrier material and the top of the tube. The two materials are not in separate compartments, however they are sufficiently viscous that they will not mix. When pressure is applied to the toothpaste tube, the main material squeezes down the thin pipe to the nozzle. Simultaneously, the pressure applied to the main material causes pressure to be forwarded to the stripe material, which thereby issues out through small holes (in the side of the pipe) onto the main carrier material as it is passing those holes.|$|E
