The RAAF was the first service to fully integrate women into operational units, doing so in 1977, with the Army and RAN following in 1979 and 1985 respectively. The ADF initially struggled to integrate women, with integration being driven by changing Australian social values and Government legislation rather than a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>attitudes</b> within the male-dominated military.|$|E
5|$|In the Muslim world, {{it seems}} the trend of hair styles is now favouring short over long in men. In the past, Bedouin Muslims often wore their hair in long braids, but {{influences}} from the Western world have caused a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>attitudes.</b> Bedouins are now {{less likely to have}} long hair. Islamic countries in North Africa such as Egypt view long hair in men as modernist and in one case the Egyptian police viewed it as Satanic and a sign of an infidel. Spanish rulers during the Medieval Period suspected long-haired males to be Moors or Moriscos, therefore long hair was forbidden since it was believed to be a Moorish custom. However, modern North African men have adopted Western short hair.|$|E

Self-discipline was needed in place of self-expression, and task orientation had to replace relaxed conviviality. Drunkenness would come to be defined as a threat to industrial efficiency and growth.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the initial}} sense of failure among the marchers, in {{subsequent}} years, the Jarrow March became recognised by historians as a defining {{event of the}} 1930s. It helped to foster the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>attitudes</b> which prepared the way to social reform measures after the Second World War, which their proponents thought would improve working conditions. The town holds numerous memorials to the march. Re-enactments celebrated the 50th and 75th anniversaries, in both cases invoking the [...] "spirit of Jarrow" [...] in their campaigns against unemployment. In contrast to the Labour Party's coldness in 1936, the post-war party leadership adopted the march {{as a metaphor for}} governmental callousness and working-class fortitude.|$|E
500|$|Two {{members of}} the CRG played a {{significant}} part in the affair over the Shanghai Commune. [...] Due to his connections with the city (he had been secretary of the Shanghai Party Committee until July 1966), Zhang Chunqiao was dispatched from the centre in November 1966 to mediate the crisis over the siege of some worker's groups at Anting. [...] Early in January the next year, Zhang Chunqiao was to return again to Shanghai with his CRG colleague Yao Wenyuan to lead the new order established {{after the fall of}} the old Party apparatus, and in early February he was to become head of the newly formed Shanghai Commune. [...] However, the combination of questions over the legitimacy of the Commune's leadership, and a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>attitudes</b> to communes in general at the centre, meant that the Shanghai Commune was to last less than a month.|$|E

English Heritage state that limited repair work or alterations on the structure were likely carried out in the nineteenth century, but exact details are unclear. In 1913 the Wheeldale structure was brought under legal protection from robbing and deliberate damage, when its conservation was guaranteed under the Ancient Monuments Consolidation and Amendment Act. In 1982 a proposal was made to re-cover the majority of the exposed section with topsoil in order to protect it from further damage, but this has not been carried out [...] There was some further, limited maintenance of some sections between 1995 and 1997 to control water erosion, in addition to major erosion repair at the southern end of the structure in 1997.|$|E

500|$|When the Iraqi Regional Branch seized power, the Syrian Regional Branch {{responded by}} not {{mentioning}} {{in the press}} release that a Ba'ath organisation had taken power in Iraq. For instance, it mentioned that Bakr had been appointed president, but did not mention his party's affiliation, and instead referred to the incident as a military coup. While the Syrian Ba'ath denied giving any legitimacy to Iraqi Ba'ath, the Iraqi Ba'ath were more conciliatory. For instance, Bakr stated [...] "They are Ba'athists, we are Ba'athists" [...] shortly after the Iraqi Regional Branch seized power. Foreign Minister Shaykli stated shortly after that [...] "there is nothing preventing co-operation between us [...] ". The anti-Iraq propaganda reached new heights within Syria {{at the same time}} that Assad was strengthening his position within the party and state. When Jadid was toppled by Assad during the Corrective Movement in 1970, it did not signal a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>attitudes,</b> and the first joint communique of the Syrian-dominated National Command and the Syrian Regional Command referred to the Iraqi Ba'ath as a [...] "rightist clique".|$|E
500|$|Food {{was mostly}} served on plates or in stew pots, and diners would take their share from {{the dishes and}} place it on trenchers of stale bread, wood or pewter with the help of spoons or bare hands. In lower-class {{households}} it was common to eat food straight off the table. Knives were used at the table, but most people were expected to bring their own, and only highly favored guests would be given a personal knife. A knife was usually shared with at least one other dinner guest, unless one was of very high rank or well-acquainted with the host. Forks for eating were not in widespread usage in Europe until the early modern period, and early on were limited to Italy. Even there {{it was not until the}} 14th century that the fork became common among Italians of all social classes. The <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>attitudes</b> can be illustrated by the reactions to the table manners of the Byzantine princess Theodora Doukaina in the late 11th century. She was the wife of Domenico Selvo, the Doge of Venice, and caused considerable dismay among upstanding Venetians. The foreign consort's insistence on having her food cut up by her eunuch servants and then eating the pieces with a golden fork shocked and upset the diners so much that there was a claim that Peter Damian, Cardinal Bishop of Ostia, later interpreted her refined foreign manners as pride and referred to her as [...] "...the Venetian Doge's wife, whose body, after her excessive delicacy, entirely rotted away." [...] However this is ambiguous since Peter Damian died in 1072 or 1073, and their marriage (Theodora and Domenico) took place in 1075.|$|E

Ironically, this show was put together by the Edinburgh International Festival as a rebuff to the emerging Fringe.

The original cover illustration showed Annie, in a black cloak, and Liza, standing away from Annie, on the Esplanade in Brooklyn overlooking the harbor. Garden commented that [...] "it really looks as if Annie is going to swoop down on Lizaâ€”almost like a vampire attacking". Although this cover was never used, future covers failed to show the girls relating, Garden said. Garden's preferred cover art, which came out in 1992 and has been reused in more recent publications, shows [...] "the two girls really relating to each other equally," [...] Garden said.|$|E
2500|$|The {{negative}} impact of the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster has changed attitudes in Japan. Political and energy experts describe [...] "nothing short of a nationwide loss of faith, not only in Japanâ€™s once-vaunted nuclear technology {{but also in the}} government, which many blame for allowing the accident to happen". Sixty thousand people marched in central Tokyo on 19 September 2011, chanting [...] "Sayonara nuclear power" [...] and waving banners, to call on Japan's government to abandon nuclear power, following the Fukushima disaster. Bishop of Osaka, Michael Goro Matsuura, has called on the solidarity of Christians worldwide to support this anti-nuclear campaign. In July 2012, 75,000 people gathered near in Tokyo for the capitalâ€™s largest anti-nuclear event yet. Organizers and participants said such demonstrations signal a fundamental <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>attitudes</b> in a nation where relatively few have been willing to engage in political protests since the 1960s.|$|E
2500|$|In 1915 the League of Nations Society {{was formed}} by British liberal leaders to promote a strong {{international}} organisation that could enforce the peaceful resolution of conflict. Later that year the League to Enforce Peace was established in America to promote similar goals. Hamilton Holt published an editorial in his New York City weekly magazine the Independent called [...] "The Way to Disarm: A Practical Proposal" [...] on September 28, 1914. It called for an international organization to agree upon the arbitration of disputes and to guarantee the territorial integrity of its members by maintaining military forces sufficient to defeat those of any non-member. The ensuing debate among prominent internationalists modified Holt's plan to align it more closely with proposals offered in Great Britain by Viscount James Bryce, a former ambassador from the U.K. to the U.S. These and other initiatives were pivotal in the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>attitudes</b> {{that gave birth to}} the League of Nations after the war.|$|E

Organizers and participants said recent demonstrations signal a fundamental <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>attitudes</b> in a nation where relatively few have been willing to engage in political protests since the 1960s. Groups and activists websites, such as the Frying Dutchman's gathered notable audience. In July 2012, Ryuichi Sakamoto organized a concert entitled [...] "No Nukes 2012," [...] featuring performances by 18 groups including Yellow Magic Orchestra, Kraftwerk, Asian Kung-Fu Generation, Saito Kazuyoshi, Akihiro Namba, and others. The concert attracted 17,000 people over two days; its U-Stream simulcast was accessed 542,000 times. These protests against nuclear power were never as large as the anti-nuclear weapons protests in 1982 in Hiroshima (200,000) and Tokyo (400,000).|$|E
2500|$|In the 17th century, John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester (1647â€“80) was {{notorious for}} obscene verses, {{many of which}} were {{published}} posthumously in compendiums of poetry by him and other Restoration rakes such as Sir Charles Sedley, Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset, and George Etherege. Though many of the poems attributed to Rochester were actually by other authors, his reputation as a libertine was such that his name was used as a selling point by publishers of collections of erotic verse for centuries after. One poem which definitely was by him was [...] "A Ramble in St. James's Park" [...] in which the protagonist's quest for healthy exercise in the park uncovers instead [...] "Bugg'ries, Rapes and Incest" [...] on ground polluted by debauchery from the time when [...] "Ancient Pict began to Whore". This poem was being censored from collections of Rochester's poetry as late as 1953, though, in line with a general <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>attitudes</b> to sexuality, it was dramatised as a scene in the film The Libertine about his life based on an existing play.|$|E
2500|$|In {{light of}} this {{regional}} nationalism and a resultant <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards Canadian identity, images {{and the role of}} the monarchy were cautiously downplayed, and Vanier's successor, Roland Michener, was the last viceroy to practice many of the office's ancient traditions, such as the wearing of the Windsor uniform, the requirement of court dress for state occasions, and expecting women to curtsey before the governor general. At the same time, he initiated new practices for the viceroy, including regular conferences with the lieutenant governors and the undertaking of state visits. He presided over Canada's centennial celebrations and the coincidental Expo 67, to which French president Charles de Gaulle was invited. Michener was with de Gaulle when he made his infamous [...] "Vive le QuÃ©bec libre" [...] speech in Montreal and was cheered wildly by the gathered crowd while they booed and jeered Michener. With the additional recognition of the monarchy as a Canadian institution, the establishment of a distinct Canadian honours system, an increase of state visits coming with Canada's growing role on the world stage, and the more prevalent use of television to visually broadcast ceremonial state affairs, the governor general became more publicly active in national life.|$|E

2500|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence}} of homosexual practice in Islamic societies for the first {{century and a half}} of the Islamic era. Homoerotic poetry appears suddenly {{at the end of the}} 8th century CE, particularly in Baghdad in the work of Abu Nuwas (756-814), who became a master of all the contemporary genres of Arabic poetry. The famous author Jahiz tried to explain the abrupt <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward homosexuality after the Abbasid Revolution by the arrival of the Abbasid army from Khurasan, who are said to have consoled themselves with male pages when they were forbidden to take their wives with them. The increased prosperity following the early conquests was accompanied by a [...] "corruption of morals" [...] in the two holy cities of Mecca and Medina, and it can be inferred that homosexual practice became more widespread during this time as a result of acculturation to foreign customs, such as the music and dance practiced by mukhannathun, who were mostly foreign in origin. The Abbasid ruler Al-Amin (809-813) was said to have required slave women to be dressed in masculine clothing so he could be persuaded to have sex with them, and a broader fashion for ghulamiyyat (boy-like girls) is reflected in literature of the period.|$|E
