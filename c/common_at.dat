5|$|During the Woodland period, many American Indians in Iowa shifted {{away from}} hunting and {{gathering}} and used more domesticated plants, although wild food was still important. Ceramics, the bow and arrow, burial mounds, and evidence {{of political and social}} hierarchy became <b>common</b> <b>at</b> Woodland sites in Iowa.|$|E
5|$|Hemlock trees form {{a canopy}} over Big Wapwallopen Creek in some places. The Wapwallopen Gorge {{is listed as}} a Locally Significant site on the Luzerne County Natural Areas Inventory. Hemlock and yellow birch are <b>common</b> <b>at</b> the gorge's upper end. However, river birch and {{sycamore}} are more <b>common</b> <b>at</b> {{the lower end of}} the gorge. There are riparian forests along Big Wapwallopen Creek in the American Legion Post 781 land tract. The tract of land also contains some wet areas such as vernal pools and marshes. These areas provide breeding grounds for reptiles, amphibians, fish, and aquatic invertebrates.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1473 in Cracow (Kraków), the {{printing}} business kept growing. By {{the turn of}} the 16th/17th century there were about 20 printing houses within the Commonwealth, 8 in Cracow, the rest mostly in Danzig (Gdańsk), Thorn (Toruń) and Zamość. The Academy of Kraków and Sigismund II possessed well-stocked libraries; smaller collections were increasingly <b>common</b> <b>at</b> noble courts, schools and townspeople's households. Illiteracy levels were falling, as {{by the end of the}} 16th century almost every parish ran a school.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Commons</b> <b>at</b> Calabasas is a {{crescent}} of high-end retail stores, restaurants and entertainment choices {{set against the}} hillsides of Calabasas, {{one of the wealthiest}} communities in California. The <b>Commons</b> <b>at</b> Calabasas is the most dominant retail center in the region. With this upscale shopping center, a town center was created where none had existed before. The developer provided urban amenities that encourage shoppers and residents to make it a destination, thereby “seeding” the Park Centre area for further development as a commercial and civic center. The <b>Commons</b> <b>at</b> Calabasas has free parking lot and numerous outdoor dining areas.|$|R

5|$|Ceramic finds at {{the site}} include {{frequent}} finds of incense-burners with handles and molded decoration. The most common domestic ceramics are of a micaceous ware and include ceramic comals (a type of griddle). Imported ceramics include Chinautla Polychrome and White-on-red, they are reasonably <b>common</b> <b>at</b> the site. Brown bowls are of a type also found in Zaculeu and Mixco Viejo, both of which also had a Late Postclassic occupation. Three-legged metates (a kind of mortar) were frequently recovered from the excavations and black obsidian blades were found in great quantities. Simple jade jewellery was also found.|$|E
5|$|Deerfield {{and other}} {{communities}} collected funds to ransom the captives. French authorities and colonists also worked to extricate the captives from their Indian captors. Within a year's time, {{most of the}} captives were in French hands, a product of frontier commerce in humans that was fairly <b>common</b> <b>at</b> the time on both sides. The French and converted Indians worked to convert their captives to Roman Catholicism, with modest success. While adult captives proved fairly resistant to proselytizing, children were more receptive or likely to accept conversion under duress.|$|E
5|$|Flukes (Trematoda) {{from the}} {{subclass}} Digenea are common parasites of small mammals with complex life cycles. In his 1988 study, Kinsella found an unprecedentend 21species of trematodes in Florida marsh rice rats. The intermediate hosts of these trematodes include {{a variety of}} invertebrates, fish, and amphibians, which are eaten by the marsh rice rat. Trematodes were generally more <b>common</b> <b>at</b> the Cedar Key saltwater marsh than at the freshwater marsh in Paynes Prairie.|$|E

5|$|In 1971, Balabushka met Penndel, Pennsylvania native Gus Szamboti at a tournament. Szamboti {{had been}} working for RCA as a {{draftsman}} and designer, but RCA layoffs were <b>common</b> <b>at</b> the time, and he had started designing and selling pool cues as a more stable job path. Though he too started production with Titlist blanks as well as blanks manufactured by WICO of Chicago, Szamboti later began making his own. Balabushka was very impressed with Szamboti's blanks and, in addition to the two men becoming fast friends, he became Szamboti's first customer, buying blanks from him for $18 apiece.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} {{competition}} rules and physical demands, long distance track races {{have much in}} common with middle-distance races, except that pacing, stamina, and race tactics become much greater factors in performances. However, a number of athletes have achieved success in both middle- and long-distance events, including Saïd Aouita who set world records from 1500m to 5000m. The use of pace-setters in long distance events is very <b>common</b> <b>at</b> the elite level, although they are not present at championship level competitions as all qualified competitors want to win.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{ytterbium}} {{is composed}} of seven stable isotopes: 168Yb, 170Yb, 171Yb, 172Yb, 173Yb, 174Yb, and 176Yb, with 174Yb being the most <b>common,</b> <b>at</b> 31.8% of the natural abundance). 27 radioisotopes have been observed, with the most stable ones being 169Yb with a half-life of 32.0 days, 175Yb with a half-life of 4.18 days, and 166Yb with a half-life of 56.7 hours. All of its remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are {{less than two hours}} and most of these have half-lives are less than 20 minutes. Ytterbium also has 12 meta states, with the most stable being 169mYb (t1/2 46 seconds).|$|E

5|$|Nearly all {{mountains}} {{appear to}} be in some stage of degradation. Large landslide deposits are <b>common</b> <b>at</b> the base of Ionian mountains, suggesting that mass wasting is the primary form of degradation. Scalloped margins are common among Io's mesas and plateaus, the result of sulfur dioxide sapping from Io's crust, producing zones of weakness along mountain margins.|$|E
5|$|Other {{authors have}} {{suggested}} that competition was limited by geographical separation. Unlike some other groups of dinosaurs, {{there appears to be}} no correlation with distance from the sea. Neither Daspletosaurus nor Gorgosaurus was more <b>common</b> <b>at</b> higher or lower elevations than the other. However, while there is some overlap, Gorgosaurus appears to be more <b>common</b> <b>at</b> northern latitudes, with species of Daspletosaurus more abundant to the south. The same pattern is seen in other groups of dinosaurs. Chasmosaurine ceratopsians and hadrosaurine hadrosaurs are also more common in the Two Medicine Formation and in southwestern North America during the Campanian. Thomas Holtz has suggested that this pattern indicates shared ecological preferences between tyrannosaurines, chasmosaurines and hadrosaurines. Holtz notes that, at the end of the later Maastrichtian stage, tyrannosaurines like Tyrannosaurus rex, hadrosaurines and chasmosaurines like Triceratops were widespread throughout western North America, while albertosaurines and centrosaurines became extinct, and lambeosaurines were very rare.|$|E
5|$|Pietro Boyesen (1819–1882) was a Danish {{photographer}} who {{spent most of}} his professional life in Rome. Boyesen had a talent for composition and characterization. In contrast to the boring studio portraits which were so <b>common</b> <b>at</b> the time, Boyesen would have his subjects pose outdoors in intimate Roman settings. By playing with the subjects clothes and their relationship to the surroundings, Boyesen would produce works presenting a somewhat timid but intimate charm.|$|E

5|$|Such {{landslides}} are <b>common</b> <b>at</b> volcanoes, {{where they}} are favoured by the steep edifices that form from lava flows being stacked {{on top of each}} other. It is not usually known what triggers the collapse, although eruption-associated earthquakes are suspected to play a role. Other volcanoes in the region with sector collapses are: Lastarria, Ollague, San Pedro, Socompa, and Tata Sabaya. The Mellado and Cerro Rosado volcanoes close to Llullaillaco also display evidence of sector collapses.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanics}} of the role-playing game system were created specifically for Bunnies & Burrows, <b>common</b> <b>at</b> {{the time of its}} original publishing. It features eight abilities and eight classes. The task resolution system is based on rolls of percentile dice. Although newer systems have updated game mechanics significantly, the ideas presented in Bunnies & Burrows created the framework for modern role-playing games.|$|E
5|$|There {{are over}} 3,000 {{registered}} hunters on Hawaii island, and hunting, for both recreation and sustenance, {{is a common}} activity on Mauna Kea. A public hunting program is used to control the numbers of introduced animals including pigs, sheep, goats, turkey, pheasants, and quail. The Mauna Kea State Recreation Area functions as a base camp for the sport. Birdwatching is also <b>common</b> <b>at</b> lower levels on the mountain. A popular site is Kīpuka Pu'u Huluhulu, a kīpuka on Mauna Kea's flank that formed when lava flows isolated the forest on a hill.|$|E

5|$|Various {{types of}} tornadoes include the {{multiple}} vortex tornado, landspout and waterspout. Waterspouts {{are characterized by}} a spiraling funnel-shaped wind current, connecting to a large cumulus or cumulonimbus cloud. They are generally classified as non-supercellular tornadoes that develop over bodies of water, but there is disagreement over whether to classify them as true tornadoes. These spiraling columns of air frequently develop in tropical areas close to the equator, and are less <b>common</b> <b>at</b> high latitudes. Other tornado-like phenomena that exist in nature include the gustnado, dust devil, fire whirls, and steam devil.|$|E
