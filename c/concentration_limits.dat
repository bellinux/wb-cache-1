25|$|Meanwhile, {{as workers}} {{struggled}} to supply {{power to the}} reactors' coolant systems and restore power to their control rooms, a number of hydrogen-air chemical explosions occurred, the first in Unit 1, on 12 March and the last in Unit 4, on 15 March. It is estimated that the hot zirconium fuel cladding-water reaction in Reactors 1–3 produced 800 to 1000 kilograms of hydrogen gas each. The pressurized gas was vented out of the reactor pressure vessel where it mixed with the ambient air, and eventually reached explosive <b>concentration</b> <b>limits</b> in Units 1 and 3. Due to piping connections between Units 3 and 4, or alternatively from the same reaction occurring in the spent fuel pool in Unit 4 itself, Unit 4 also filled with hydrogen, resulting in an explosion. In each case, the hydrogen-air explosions occurred {{at the top of}} each unit, that was in their upper secondary containment buildings. Drone overflights on 20 March and afterwards captured clear images of the effects of each explosion on the outside structures, while the view inside was largely obscured by shadows and debris.|$|E
2500|$|Legal <b>concentration</b> <b>limits</b> have {{differed}} {{greatly from}} place to place (see table right). [...] For example, in June 2009 the Ontario Drinking Water Advisory Council recommended lowering the limit from 7,000Bq/L to 20Bq/L. According to the NRC, tritium is the least dangerous radionuclide because it emits very weak radiation and leaves the body relatively quickly. The typical human body contains roughly 3,700Bq of potassium-40. [...] The amount released by any given nuclear plant also varies greatly; the total release for nuclear plants in the United States in 2003 was from nondetected up to 2,080curies (77TBq).|$|E
40|$|The maximal <b>concentration</b> <b>limit</b> {{of solar}} {{radiation}} for photovoltaic applications {{is assumed to}} be constant, at Cmax≈ 46, 000 suns. This limit is easily found via a geometrical application of the 2 nd law of thermodynamics to a radiation transfer system [A. Rabl, Sol. Energy vol. 18, pp. 93 - 111, 1976]. However, previous analysis did not include the generation of entropy in photovoltaic conversion. Here, we show a bandgap dependence of the maximal <b>concentration</b> <b>limit</b> for a semiconductor solar cell when taking this entropy generation into account, and show that the limit is reduced for low bandgap materials. This new <b>concentration</b> <b>limit</b> lies in contrast to the assumed invariance of the <b>concentration</b> <b>limit,</b> and we attribute this difference to a breakdown in the assumptions used to derive the traditional detailed-balance model.

40|$|In 1993 {{during the}} process of the German reunification East Germany raised the blood alcohol <b>concentration</b> <b>limit</b> from 0 % to 0. 08 %. Three {{roadside}} surveys were conducted to assess the short-term and long-term effects of raising the blood alcohol <b>concentration</b> <b>limit</b> (directly before the change, at 4 months, and at 16 months). Roadside breath alcohol tests were conducted to determine the frequency of drunken driving. A short roadside interview was used to assess attitudes towards driving {{under the influence of alcohol}}. Additionally, selected subjects were questioned extensively over the telephone. Overall, 21, 198 drivers were stopped and tested. By comparing an East German region in which the blood alcohol <b>concentration</b> <b>limit</b> had been raised to a West German region in which no such legal change had been enacted, the effects of different limits as well as the effect of raising the limit were analyzed. The results show that the major effect of raising the blood alcohol <b>concentration</b> <b>limit</b> is an increase in the blood alcohol concentration of drivers who are under the influence of alcohol while the number of such drivers remains constant. This effect is especially strong for young drivers, indicating that they are more vulnerable to legal changes than older drivers.

40|$|In {{the article}} we {{consider}} the influence of agricultural technologies of cultivation of winter crops on existence of various forms of heavy metals in an arable layer of earth in the conditions and their accumulation in grain production. The gross content of compounds of copper in an arable layer of black leached soil is above background values (maximum <b>concentration</b> <b>limit</b> 1, 5 - 1, 7), {{a share of the}} fixed connections makes 75 %. The gross content of zinc exceeds background value for chernozems (1, 25 clark).

Supplement of an arable layer of earth with mobile forms of copper, zinc and cobalt low, manganese - corresponds to the average level. Speaking of the degree of actual mobility the studied elements settle down in sequence: Cd> Mn> Co> Pb> Zn> Cu. Degree of potential availability decreases among: Zn> Mn>Pb> Co> Cu.
