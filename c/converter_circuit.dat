One example of the programmable reference circuit is a programmable voltage reference source, while a second example of a programmable reference circuit is a programmable reference current source. The programmable voltage reference source and/or the reference current source may be incorporated into several types of circuits, such as comparator circuits, current-mirror <b>circuits,</b> and <b>converter</b> <b>circuits.</b> Comparator circuits and current-mirror circuits are often incorporated into <b>circuits</b> such as <b>converter</b> <b>circuits.</b> <b>Converter</b> <b>circuits</b> include analog-to-digital <b>converters</b> and digital-to-analog converters.

40|$|An {{approach}} to modelling DC-DC <b>converter</b> <b>circuits</b> based on graph theoretic concepts {{is discussed in}} this paper. The DC-DC <b>converter</b> <b>circuits</b> are treated as networks containing switches, with the magnitudes of their associated eigenvalues {{much smaller than the}} switching frequency. The procedure for modelling this class of networks essentially involves separating the original network into two N-port networks, one containing those branches responsible for all phenomena peculiar to the switching action and the other containing the remaining branches of the network. The two N-port networks thus formed lead to a systematic and convenient way of developing low-frequency circuit models for DC-DC <b>converter</b> <b>circuits.</b> Department of Electronic and Information Engineerin...|$|R
50|$|A {{synchronous}} {{buck converter}} is {{a modified version}} of the basic buck <b>converter</b> <b>circuit</b> topology in which the diode, D, is replaced by a second switch, S2. This modification is a tradeoff between increased cost and improved efficiency.|$|E
50|$|A {{digital signal}} {{that does not}} contain any samples at 0 dBFS can still clip when {{converted}} to analog form due to the signal reconstruction process interpolating between samples. This can be prevented by careful digital-to-analog <b>converter</b> <b>circuit</b> design.|$|E

40|$|Simulink {{behavior}} {{models of}} DC±DC switching <b>converter</b> <b>circuits</b> using pulse-width modulation (PWM) control ICs are devised in this paper. Although some assumptions {{are made to}} simplify the Simulink behavior models, the likeness between the simulation and experimental results for both transient and steady-state responses shows that these behavior models capture almost all the important characteristics of the DC±DC switching <b>converter</b> <b>circuits.</b> Therefore, these behavior models can be very good teaching aids for students to learn the differences between ideal circuits and practical implementations. With these Simulink behavior models, students can also validate quickly {{whether or not their}} designs of feedback controllers for DC±DC switching <b>converter</b> <b>circuits</b> implemented with PWM control ICs meet the prescribed performance requirements...|$|R

50|$|Circuits which exhibit chaotic {{behavior}} can be considered quasi-periodic or nonperiodic oscillators, and like all oscillators require a negative resistance in the circuit to provide power. Chua's circuit, a simple nonlinear circuit widely used as the standard example of a chaotic system, requires a nonlinear active resistor component, sometimes called Chua's diode. This is usually synthesized using a negative impedance <b>converter</b> <b>circuit.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{primary and}} {{secondary}} sides may be connected with a capacitor to reduce EMI and compensate for various capacitive couplings in the <b>converter</b> <b>circuit,</b> where the transformer is one. This may result in electric shock in some cases. The current flowing from line or neutral through a 2 kΩ resistor to any accessible part must, according to IEC 60950, be less than 250 μA for IT equipment.|$|E
50|$|Digital signals often arise via {{sampling}} of analog signals, for example, a continually fluctuating voltage {{on a line}} that can be digitized by an analog-to-digital <b>converter</b> <b>circuit,</b> wherein the circuit will read the voltage level on the line, say, every 50 microseconds and represent each reading with a fixed number of bits.

5000|$|The {{multiphase}} buck <b>converter</b> is a <b>circuit</b> topology where basic buck <b>converter</b> <b>circuits</b> {{are placed}} in parallel between the input and load. Each of the n [...] "phases" [...] is turned on at equally spaced intervals over the switching period. This circuit is typically used with the synchronous buck topology, described above.|$|R
50|$|Most DC to DC <b>converter</b> <b>circuits</b> also {{regulate}} the output voltage. Some exceptions include high-efficiency LED power sources, {{which are a}} kind of DC to DC converter that regulates the current through the LEDs, and simple charge pumps which double or triple the output voltage.|$|R
50|$|A load with {{resistance}} R=V/I {{equal to}} the reciprocal of this value draws the maximum power from the device. This is sometimes called the 'characteristic resistance' of the cell. This is a dynamic quantity which changes depending {{on the level of}} illumination, as well as other factors such as temperature and the age of the cell. If the resistance is lower or higher than this value, the power drawn will be less than the maximum available, and thus the cell will not be used as efficiently as it could be. Maximum power point trackers utilize different types of control circuit or logic to search for this point and thus to allow the <b>converter</b> <b>circuit</b> to extract the maximum power available from a cell.|$|E
50|$|Powder phosphor-based {{electroluminescent}} {{panels are}} frequently used as backlights to liquid crystal displays. They readily provide a gentle, even illumination {{to the entire}} display while consuming relatively little electric power. This makes them convenient for battery-operated devices such as pagers, wristwatches, and computer-controlled thermostats, and their gentle green-cyan glow is a common sight in the technological world. They do, however, require relatively high voltage (between 60 and 600 volts). For battery-operated devices, this voltage must be generated by a <b>converter</b> <b>circuit</b> within the device; this converter often makes an audible whine or siren sound while the backlight is activated. For line-voltage-operated devices, it may be supplied directly from the power line. Electroluminescent nightlights operate in this fashion. Brightness per unit area increases with increased voltage and frequency.|$|E
50|$|Just as the 700 type {{came about}} {{as a result of}} public demand. fuelled by US {{television}} shows, so the advent of 'Touchtone Dialling' in later American TV output brought about a demand for the same at home in the UK. Unfortunately the GPO did not yet have the exchange equipment necessary to support 'Touchtone' or DTMF (Dual Tone Multi-Frequency) as the GPO preferred to call it. So they decided to introduce a simulated version instead. This would comprise a very ordinary 700 type instrument, with a push button mod. kit fitted. Beneath the smart-looking buttons, a small <b>converter</b> <b>circuit,</b> powered by re-chargeable Ni-Cd cells, would convert the button presses back to perfectly normal, 10 impulse per second, loop-disconnect dial output, i.e. the new keypad was made to simulate an old rotary dial.|$|E
