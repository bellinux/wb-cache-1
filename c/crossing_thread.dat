40|$|Internal {{representation}} and static slicing algorithm of concurrent programs are studied. Based on the comparison among existed slicing algorithms {{and analysis of}} the fact that Krinke`s algorithm produced imprecise program slice for the program structure which has loops nested with one or more threads, a conclusion is drawn that the reason for the impreciseness is that Krinke`s data structure-threaded program dependence graph had over coarse definitions of data dependence relations between threads and the constraint put on the execution path in concurrent program is unduly loose. An improved threaded program dependence graph is proposed which adds a new dependence relation of loop-carried data dependence <b>crossing</b> <b>thread</b> boundaries. An improved slicing algorithm is also proposed which introduces a new concept of regioned execution witness to further constrain the execution path. The pseudo code of algorithm adding loop-carried data dependence relations <b>crossing</b> <b>thread</b> boundaries is given. The pseudo code of the new slicing algorithm is also given whose complexity has been analyzed. Examples shows that the improved slicing algorithm designed on the improved data structure can restrain the impreciseness of Krinke`s...|$|E

We determine magnetic helicity sign of laments using high resolution observations performed by Transition Region And Coronal Explorer. At EUV wavelengths, laments sometimes appear as mixtures of bright threads and dark threads. This characteristic has {{enabled us to}} discern overlying threads and underlying ones, and to determine the sign of magnetic helicity based upon {{the assumption that the}} helicity sign of two <b>crossing</b> <b>thread</b> segments is {{the same as that of}} the lament. Our results support the notion that dextral laments have negative magnetic helicity, and sinistral laments, positive one. Subject headings: Sun: prominences, Sun: laments, Sun: magnetic eld 1.

50|$|Sleying is {{the term}} used for pulling the warp threads through the loom, which happens in the warping process (the process of putting a warp on the loom). Sleying is done by {{inserting}} a reed hook through the reed, hooking the warp threads and then pulling them through the dent. The warp threads are taken in the order {{they come from the}} heddles, so as to avoid <b>crossing</b> <b>threads.</b> If the <b>threads</b> <b>cross,</b> the shed will not open correctly when the weaving is begun.|$|R

50|$|Coarse threads {{are more}} {{resistant}} to stripping and <b>cross</b> <b>threading</b> because they have greater flank engagement. Coarse threads install much faster as they require fewer turns per unit length. Finer threads are stronger as they have a larger stress area for the same diameter thread. Fine threads {{are less likely to}} vibrate loose as they have a smaller helix angle and allow finer adjustment. Finer threads develop greater preload with less tightening torque.|$|R
50|$|The #6-32 UNC is a thicker screw {{with a more}} coarse thread. This {{makes it}} more {{suitable}} for fastening larger parts and thicker materials requiring increased holding strength.

50|$|Each {{thread in}} the warp <b>crosses</b> each <b>thread</b> in the weft at right angles. Where a thread in the warp <b>crosses</b> a <b>thread</b> {{of the same}} colour in the weft they produce a solid colour on the tartan, while a <b>thread</b> <b>crossing</b> another of a {{different}} colour produces an equal mixture of the two colours. Thus, a set of two base colours produces three different colours including one mixture. The total number of colours, including mixtures, increases quadratically {{with the number of}} base colours so a sett of six base colours produces fifteen mixtures and a total of twenty-one different colours. This means that the more stripes and colours used, the more blurred and subdued the tartan's pattern becomes.|$|R

When the eye is so placed, that the <b>crossed</b> <b>threads</b> exactly cover their reflexion, the line of sight is truly vertical; and, if the distant object be brought down to them by the sextant, the angle read off will be 90 degrees + altitude. Captain George's arrangement of glass floating on mercury (made by Cary, Fleet Street, London), allows of very low angles being observed, but the use of this instrument requires considerable caution as to the purity of the mercury and the cleanliness of the glass.|$|R

40|$|The Fastener Starter is a {{creative}} solution {{to prevent the}} loss of small fasteners during their installation. This is the only currently available tool that can firmly grip and hold a single screw, bolt, nut, washer, spacer, or any combination of these parts. Other commercially available fastener starters are unable to accommodate a variety of parts simultaneously. The Fastener Starter is a more capable and easier tool to use than prior tools. Its compact size allows it to be used effectively in cramped, difficult-to-see locations. Its design also allows it {{to be used with}} or without handles and extenders in other difficult-to-reach locations. It provides better protection against <b>cross</b> <b>threading</b> and loss of fasteners and associated parts. The Fastener Starter is non-magnetic and does not off-gas, thus meeting flight hardware requirements. The Fastener Starter incorporates a combination of features of several commercially available tools, providing an improved means of installing small fasteners. The Fastener Starter includes a custom molded insert that can be removed easily and replaced with a conventional tool bit (e. g., a screwdriver or hex-driver bit). When used with the insert, the Fastener Starter prevents <b>cross</b> <b>threading</b> and damage to internal threaded holes. This is achieved by allowing the fastener to slip within the tool insert when used without a conventional tool bit. Alternatively, without the insert and with a tool bit, the Fastener Starter can torque a fastener. The Fastener Starter has a square recess hole that accepts a conventional square drive handle or extension to accommodate a variety of applications by providing flexibility in handle style and length...|$|R

We propose a semi-automatic, and scalable scheme for heap data man-agement that hides this complexity in a library with a much natural programming interface. Furthermore, for embedded applications, where the maximum heap size can be known at compile time, we propose optimizations on the heap manage-ment to significantly improve the application performance. Experiments on several benchmarks of MiBench executing on the Sony Playstation 3 show that our scheme is easier to use, and if we know the maximum size of heap data, then our optimizations can improve application performance by an average of 14 %...|$|R

40|$|Global {{address space}} {{languages}} like UPC exhibit high performance and portability {{on a broad}} class of shared and distributed memory parallel architectures. The most scalable applications use bulk memory copies rather than individual reads and writes to the shared space, but finer-grained sharing can be useful for scenarios such as dynamic load balancing, event signaling, and distributed hash tables. In this paper we present three optimization techniques for global address space programs with fine-grained communication: redundancy elimination, use of split-phase communication, and communication coalescing. Parallel UPC programs are analyzed using static single assignment form and a data flow graph, which are extended to handle the various shared and private pointer types that are available in UPC. The optimizations also take advantage of UPC's relaxed memory consistency model, which reduces the need for <b>cross</b> <b>thread</b> analysis. We demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} analysis and optimizations using several benchmarks, which were chosen to reflect the kinds of fine-grained, communication-intensive phases that exist in some larger applications.

He is also responsible for guaranteeing that the course of history flows as it should. As Time, he is immune to paradox, and to the possibility of multiple futures. Should actions occur to change the course of the future, his memories will change with it. However, typically his original memories are accepted as the desirable ones, as one of his major tasks is to make sure it does not get changed around without adequate reason. This is, of course, why he lives backwards - he would be unable to properly deal with making the future happen as planned if he was unaware of the plan.|$|R
