Perturbation dataset methods becomes less privacy because of the training data samples are leakages in restoration procedure, to overcome these leakage problem proposed secure multiparty communication methods with the use of cryptographic methods like RSA encryption methods and to support continuous values attribute proposed an C 5. 0 decision tree based classification.

40|$|Despite {{the recent}} passing of {{legislation}} by the National People's Congress of China in 2009, many food businesses in China {{have yet to}} implement a third <b>party</b> <b>certified</b> food safety management system (FSMS). While the extent literature identifies a number of internal and external barriers and benefits, {{the extent to which}} these impact on the business is thought to be dependent upon how much progress the firm has made on its journey towards quality assurance and the environment within which the firm operates. To test this proposition, the barriers and the benefits accrued from the implementation of a third <b>party</b> <b>certified</b> FSMS were explored by segregating the participating firms into three distinct groups; (i) those that have yet to implement a third <b>party</b> <b>certified</b> FSMS; (ii) those that were in the process of adopting a third <b>party</b> <b>certified</b> FSMS; and (iii) those that were already operating under a third <b>party</b> <b>certified</b> FSMS.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} a monopolistic <b>certifying</b> <b>party</b> can have {{incentives}} to disclose revealing information about the agent he is certifying. Using a three-person gametheoretic model and allowing certificate users (buyers) to have noisy estimates of the quality level of the agent being certified (seller), a disclosure {{in the form of}} ordered ranking of levels is predicted. This contrasts with previous results in certification theory stating that monopolistic certifiers disclose a minimum amount of information (with no informational value) about the <b>party</b> being <b>certified,</b> in order to extract all informational rents from the market. The predicted disclosure is consistent with real life observations of certification disclosure as found in debt ratings (notches) and hotels listings (using a discrete system of stars).

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{foundation}} {{principles for}} the recent major offshore wind farm projects in Europe have been dominated by two types of foundation solutions, the gravitational foundation and the monopile. A fully operational 3. 0 MW offshore wind turbine was installed on a prototype of the bucket foundation at the test field in Frederikshavn in December 2002. A five-year research and development project has proven the bucket foundation to be feasible in suitable soil conditions in water depth from near shore to approximately 40 meters. The bucket foundation design reduces the steel weight by half compared with a traditional monopile solution and {{the installation of the}} bucket foundation is much easier and does not require heavy installation equipment. In this paper the full-scale field installation of the prototype is described. A design procedure has been developed in cooperation with the <b>certifying</b> <b>party</b> in order to maintain an approval procedure in future projects. In order to develop these design procedure relevant studies involving techniques as diverse as laboratory model testing, field trials at reduced scale, and a full-scale field installation, has been performed.
