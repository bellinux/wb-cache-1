25|$|In normal early {{embryonic}} development, {{the outer}} epithelial layer contains <b>cytotrophoblast</b> cells, a stem cell type {{found in the}} trophoblast that later differentiates into the fetal placenta. These cells differentiate into many placental cells types, including extravillous trophoblast cells. Extravillous trophoblast cells are an invasive cell type which remodel the maternal spiral arteries by replacing the maternal epithelium and smooth muscle lining the spiral arteries causing artery dilation. This prevents maternal vasoconstriction in the spiral arteries and allows for continued blood and nutrient supply to the growing fetus with low resistance and high blood flow.|$|E
50|$|A <b>cytotrophoblast</b> cap penetrates {{through the}} fetus' syncytiotrophoblasts and reaches the {{maternal}} decidua, forming the anchoring villus.

The <b>cytotrophoblast</b> {{structures of the}} anchoring villi that spread out are called cytotrophoblastic columns. Once formation is complete, the <b>cytotrophoblast</b> layer from the anchoring villi disappears, leaving behind a mesoderm core surrounded by syncytial cells.|$|E
50|$|The {{invasive}} lineage creates cytotrophoblasts {{that are}} essential {{in the process of}} implantation and forming a fully functional placenta.

40|$|Epigenetic processes, such as DNA methylation, {{are known}} to {{regulate}} tissue specific gene expression. We explored this concept in the placenta to define whether DNA methylation is cell-type specific. <b>Cytotrophoblasts</b> and fibroblasts were isolated from normal midtrimester placentas. Using immunocytochemistry, we demonstrated 95 % purity for <b>cytotrophoblasts</b> and 60 – 70 % for fibroblasts. We compared DNA methylation profiles from <b>cytotrophoblasts,</b> fibroblasts and whole placental villi using bisulfite modified genomic DNA hybridized to the Illumina Methylation 27 array. Euclidean cluster analysis of the DNA methylation profiles showed two main clusters, one containing <b>cytotrophoblasts</b> and placenta, the other fibroblasts. Differential methylation analysis identified 442 autosomal CpG sites that differed between <b>cytotrophoblasts</b> and fibroblasts, 315 between placenta and fibroblasts and 61 between placenta and <b>cytotrophoblasts.</b> Three candidate methylation differences were validated by targeted pyrosequencing assays. Pyrosequencing assays were developed for CpG sites less methylated in <b>cytotrophoblasts</b> than fibroblasts mapping to the promoter region of the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin 5 (CGB 5), {{as well as two}} CpG sites mapping to each of two tumor suppressor genes. Our data suggest that epigenetic regulation of gene expression {{is likely to be a}} key factor in the functional specificity of <b>cytotrophoblasts.</b> These data are proof of principle for cell-type specific epigenetic regulation in placenta and demonstrate that the methylation profile of placenta is mainly driven by <b>cytotrophoblasts...</b>|$|R

40|$|Preeclampsia is {{associated}} with placental hypoxia at early gestation. We therefore investigated the effect of hypoxia on the apoptosis of cultured first trimester human <b>cytotrophoblasts</b> and the expression of apoptosis relevant proteins, Bcl- 2 and Bax. First trimester human <b>cytotrophoblasts</b> were isolated and cultured under either standard or hypoxic conditions. Cellular apoptosis was monitored by TUNEL and Annexin V binding, and the expression of Bcl- 2 and Bax was determined by Western blot analysis. Apoptosis increased significantly in <b>cytotrophoblasts</b> cultured for 24 h under hypoxic conditions in contrast with those cultured under standard conditions, meanwhile expression of Bcl- 2 reduced, and that of Bax increased. These changes suggested that hypoxia induced apoptosis in cultured first trimester <b>cytotrophoblasts</b> with altered Bcl- 2 and Bax expression.

40|$|AbstractThrough {{an unusual}} {{differentiation}} process, human trophoblast progenitors (<b>cytotrophoblasts)</b> {{give rise to}} tumor-like cells that invade the uterus. By an unknown mechanism, invasive <b>cytotrophoblasts</b> exhibit permanent cell cycle withdrawal. Here, we report molecular cytogenetic data showing that ∼ 20 to 60 % of these interphase cells had acquired aneusomies involving chromosomes X, Y, or 16. The incidence positively correlated with gestational age and differentiation to an invasive phenotype. Scoring 12 chromosomes in flow-sorted <b>cytotrophoblasts</b> showed that more than 95 % of the cells were hyperdiploid. Thus, aneuploidy {{appears to be an}} important component of normal placentation, perhaps limiting the proliferative and invasive potential of <b>cytotrophoblasts</b> within the uterus...|$|R

50|$|The <b>cytotrophoblast</b> is {{considered}} to be the trophoblastic stem cell because the layer surrounding the blastocyst remains while daughter cells differentiate and proliferate to function in multiple roles. There are two lineages that cytotrophoblastic cells may differentiate through: fusion and invasive. The fusion lineage yields syncytiotrophoblast and the invasive lineage yields interstitial <b>cytotrophoblast</b> cells.|$|E
50|$|At day 9-10 of {{embryonic}} development, {{cells from the}} hypoblast begin to migrate to the embryonic pole, forming a layer of cells just beneath the <b>cytotrophoblast,</b> called Heuser's Membrane.

40|$|AbstractAnalysis of placentas {{infected}} with human cytomegalovirus (CMV) suggested that viral transmission could involve differentiating/invasive <b>cytotrophoblasts</b> in villi that attach the placenta to the uterine wall. To parse the cellular components in this process, {{we developed a}} coculture system of polarized uterine microvascular endothelial cell (UtMVEC) infection with an endothelial cell–tropic pathogenic strain of CMV. Then we evaluated the potential role of neutrophils and endothelial cells in the spread of infection to differentiating <b>cytotrophoblasts.</b> As shown by immunocytochemistry and analysis of viral replication, CMV preferentially infected endothelial cells via apical membranes and disrupted cell junction proteins, thereby altering paracellular permeability and cell polarity. Neutralizing antibodies to CMV glycoprotein B, an envelope component that facilitates virion penetration, blocked plaque formation in polarized UtMVEC. Neutrophils transmitted CMV infection to UtMVEC, which in turn infected <b>cytotrophoblasts.</b> However, neutrophils did not directly infect <b>cytotrophoblasts.</b> These findings implicate endothelial cells from the uterine microvasculature as a potential source for CMV infection of endovascular <b>cytotrophoblasts</b> of the anchoring villi. Possibly the cytokine/chemokine milieu in the pregnant uterus could attract immune cells that infect endothelial cells in hybrid fetal–maternal vessels. In turn, these cells could infect endovascular <b>cytotrophoblasts,</b> one possible initiation point of a cascade that results in retrograde placental CMV infection...|$|R
40|$|Collagenolytic {{activity}} of <b>cytotrophoblasts</b> is stimulated by glycoproteins of the extracellular matrix and since this stimulation can possibly occur through integrins, we measured the gelatinolytic {{activity of}} villous and extravillous <b>cytotrophoblasts</b> {{according to the}} type of integrins expressed on these cells. <b>Cytotrophoblasts</b> were isolated from legal abortions, immunopurified with anti-CD 45, separated according to their expression of histocompatibility-linked antigen (HLA) -G, α 6 or α 5 integrin subunits and cultured for 5 days on plastic or agarose. Fetal fibronectin, human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) and the gelatinolytic activity were measured in the culture supernatants. Following immunopurification with anti-CD 45, the gelatinolytic activity of <b>cytotrophoblasts</b> was significantly higher than before, indicating that contaminating lymphomyeloid cells secreted gelatinolytic inhibitors. HLA-G positive cells secreted significantly more gelatinases than HLA-G negative cells but their HCG secretion was similar. Compared to α 5 positive cells, α 6 positive <b>cytotrophoblasts</b> secreted significantly more gelatinases, significantly less fibronectin but similar amounts of HCG. We conclude that during trophoblast invasion, extravillous <b>cytotrophoblasts</b> (HLA-G positive) expressing the α 6 integrin subunit represent the invasive population of cells (high gelatinase and low fibronectin secretion). When expression of the α 5 integrin subunit is turned on, their invasive behaviour ceases and they secrete low amounts of gelatinases and high concentrations of fibronecti...|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} {{associated}} disorder is pre-eclampsia, affecting approximately 7% of all births. It {{is characterized by}} a failure of the <b>cytotrophoblast</b> to invade the uterus and its vasculature, specifically the spiral arteries that the endovascular <b>cytotrophoblast</b> should invade. The result of this is decreased blood flow to the fetus which may cause intrauterine growth restriction. Clinical symptoms of pre-eclampsia in the mother are most commonly high blood pressure, proteinuria and edema.|$|E

40|$|During early human {{pregnancy}} extravillous <b>cytotrophoblasts</b> {{invade the}} uterus and also migrate up the spiral arteries, transforming them into large vessels of low resistance. Failure of transformation {{has been described}} in pre-eclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and miscarriage. Recent evidence suggests that some maternal vessels undergo structural changes without interaction with <b>cytotrophoblasts.</b> The possibility arises that local vasoactive mediators such as nitric oxide result in spiral artery dilatation before their invasion. In support of this, a recent histological study in the guinea pig suggested that <b>cytotrophoblasts</b> expressed nitric oxide synthase (NOS) as they surrounded vessels. This study tested the hypothesis that invading <b>cytotrophoblasts</b> express NOS and therefore {{have the potential to}} induce vasodilatation by releasing nitric oxide. The expression of NOS on extravillous <b>cytotrophoblasts</b> was studied in placental bed biopsies, obtained, using a transcervical sampling technique, from normal human pregnancies between 8 to 19 weeks of gestation and in the third trimester. Whereas eNOS was expressed by syncytiotrophoblast, neither eNOS or iNOS was expressed by extravillous <b>cytotrophoblasts</b> at any time during invasion. The mechanisms controlling spiral artery transformation are pivotal to understanding normal and abnormal placentation. These results suggest that trophoblast-derived nitric oxide is unlikely to contribute to spiral artery dilatation...|$|R
40|$|Cytomegalovirus (CMV), {{the major}} viral cause of {{congenital}} disease, infects the uterus and developing placenta and spreads to the fetus throughout gestation. Virus replicates in invasive <b>cytotrophoblasts</b> in the decidua, and maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG) -CMV virion complexes, which are transcytosed by the neonatal Fc receptor across syncytiotrophoblasts, infect underlying <b>cytotrophoblasts</b> in chorionic villi. Immunity {{is central to}} protection of the placenta-fetal unit: infection can occur when IgG has a low neutralizing titer. Here we used immunohisto-chemical and function-blocking methods to correlate infection in the placenta with expression of potential CMV receptors in situ and in vitro. In placental villi, syncytiotrophoblasts express the virion receptor epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) but lack integrin coreceptors, and virion uptake occurs without replication. Focal infection can occur when transcytosed virions reach EGFR-expressing <b>cytotrophoblasts</b> that selectively initiate expression of V integrin. In cell columns, proximal <b>cytotrophoblasts</b> lack receptors and distal cells express integrins 11 and V 3, enabling virion attachment. In the decidua, invasive <b>cytotrophoblasts</b> expressing coreceptors upregulate EGFR, thereby dramatically increasing susceptibility to infection. Our findings indicate that virion interactions with <b>cytotrophoblasts</b> expressing receptors in the placenta (i) change as the cells differentiate and (ii) correlate with spatially distinct sites of CMV replication in maternal and fetal compartments.

40|$|The tumor {{suppressor}} protein BARD 1, originally discovered as BRCA 1 -binding protein, acts {{in conjunction}} with BRCA 1 as ubiquitin ligase. BARD 1 and BRCA 1 form a stable heterodimer and dimerization, which is required for most tumor suppressor functions attributed to BRCA 1. In addition, BARD 1 has BRCA 1 -independent functions in apoptosis, and a role in control of tissue homeostasis was suggested. However, cancer-associated mutations of BARD 1 are rare; on the contrary, overexpression of truncated BARD 1 was found in breast and ovarian cancer and correlated with poor prognosis. Here we report that human <b>cytotrophoblasts,</b> which show a strong similarity with cancer cells in respect of their invasive behavior and capacity of matrix metalloprotease production, overexpress isoforms of BARD 1 derived from differential splicing. We demonstrate that expression of BARD 1 and its isoforms is temporally and spatially regulated by human chorionic gonadotropin and by hypoxia, both factors known to regulate the invasive phase and proliferation of <b>cytotrophoblasts.</b> Interestingly, we found a subset of BARD 1 isoforms secreted by <b>cytotrophoblasts.</b> BARD 1 repression by siRNAs, mitigates the interference of <b>cytotrophoblasts</b> with cell adhesion of collagen matrix-dependent epithelial cells, suggesting a role of BARD 1 isoforms in extracellular matrix remodelling and in <b>cytotrophoblasts</b> invasion...|$|R
5000|$|Synyctin-1 {{mediated}} trophoblast fusion {{is essential}} for normal placental development. The placenta is composed on two cell layers: <b>cytotrophoblast</b> and syncytiotrophoblast layer. Cytotrophoblasts are continually dividing, non-differentiated cells and syncytiotrophoblasts are fully differentiated, non dividing, fused cells. Syncytin-1 expression {{on the surface of}} cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts mediate fusion. The syncytiotrophoblast layer is the necessary interface between the developing embryo and the maternal blood supply, allowing nutrient and waste exchange and blocking maternal immune cell invasion, preventing immune rejection of the foetus. Syncytiotrophoblasts are forced into senescence by fusion. Therefore, <b>cytotrophoblast</b> proliferation is necessary for growth and maintenance of the syncytiotrophoblast layer. Syncytin-1 expression in cytotrophoblasts promotes G1/S transition and proliferation thereby ensuring continual replenishment of the <b>cytotrophoblast</b> pool. [...] The name syncytin derives from its involvement in the formation of syncytium, the multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast protoplasm.

40|$|The syncytiotrophoblast is the {{principal}} component of the human placenta involved in feto-maternal exchanges and hormone secretion. The syncytiotrophoblast arises from the fusion of villous <b>cytotrophoblasts.</b> We recently showed that functional gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) is an important prerequisite for syncytiotrophoblast formation and that connexin 43 (Cx 43) is present in <b>cytotrophoblasts</b> and in the syncytiotrophoblast. To determine whether Cx 43 is directly involved in trophoblast fusion, we used an antisense strategy in primary cultures of human villous <b>cytotrophoblasts</b> that spontaneously differentiate into the syncytiotrophoblast by cell fusion. We assessed the morphological and functional differentiation of trophoblasts by desmoplakin immunostaining, by quantifying hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) production and by measuring the expression of specific trophoblast genes (hCG and HERV-W). Furthermore, we used the gap-FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching) method to investigate functional GJIC. <b>Cytotrophoblasts</b> treated with Cx 43 antisense aggregated and fused poorly.

In this in vivo human placentation model, human <b>cytotrophoblasts</b> invade the renal parenchyma, remodel resident arteries, and induce a robust lymphangiogenic response. VR 1814 replicated in villous and cell column <b>cytotrophoblasts</b> and reduced formation of anchoring villi in vitro.

In contrast, AD 169 grew poorly in <b>cytotrophoblasts</b> in explants, and anchoring villi formed normally in vitro. Likewise, viral replication was impaired in xenografts, and <b>cytotrophoblasts</b> retained invasive capacity, but some partially remodeled blood vessels incorporated lymphatic endothelial cells and were permeable to blood. The expression of both vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) -C and {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} increased in VR 1814 -infected explants, whereas VEGF-A and soluble VEGF receptor- 3 increased in those infected with AD 169. Our results suggest that viral replication and paracrine factors could undermine vascular remodeling and cytotrophoblast-induced lymphangiogenesis, contributing to bleeding, hypoxia, and edema in pregnancies complicated by congenital human cytomegalovirus infection...|$|R
