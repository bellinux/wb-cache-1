25|$|In a fire, PVC-coated wires {{can form}} {{hydrogen}} chloride fumes; the chlorine serves to scavenge free radicals {{and is the}} source of the material's fire retardance. While hydrogen chloride fumes can also pose a health hazard in their own right, it dissolves in moisture and breaks down onto surfaces, particularly in areas where the air is cool enough to breathe, and is not available for inhalation. Frequently in applications where smoke is a major hazard (notably in tunnels and communal areas), PVC-free <b>cable</b> <b>insulation</b> is preferred, such as low smoke zero halogen (LSZH) insulation.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of underground XLPE cables in service is critical because of ageing mechanisms influences. Many appropriate techniques {{can be used}} to evaluate the {{performance of}} aged and unaged underground XLPE cables. One of the techniques is based on tan delta and capacitance parameters of the <b>cable</b> <b>insulations.</b> This study focuses on underground XLPE cables which rated at 11 kV and 22 kV for both 1 -core and 3 -core types. Tan delta and capacitance data of underground XLPE cables are obtained using a Schering bridge instrument. Tan delta and capacitance measurements are performed at ambient temperature (about 26. 6 oC) and at 50 Hz power frequency. The analysis of data shows that tan delta values increased in proportion to the aging time of the cables. Meanwhile the data analysis of the capacitance values of the cable insulator shows that the values of capacitance inconsistent. From this study, tan delta parameter is more accurate and appropriate parameter for evaluating performance of underground XLPE cables as compared to capacitance parameter. Therefore, the finding of this study shows that aging mechanisms contributes the deteriorations of underground XLPE <b>cable</b> <b>insulations</b> in service and consequently the value of tan delta increases with aging time of the cables...|$|R
