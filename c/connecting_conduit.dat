40|$|Skeletal muscle ventricles are {{constructed}} from canine latissimus dorsi muscle. These skeletal muscle ventricles {{can be placed}} subcutaneously on the chest wall or inside the chest cavity. Skeletal muscle ventricles {{are connected to the}} descending thoracic aorta and activated to pump blood as aortic diastolic counterpulsators. The skeletal muscle ventricle in 1 animal pumped blood in the circulation for 27 months. Skeletal muscle ventricles can also function effectively under the condition of low cardiac output. Although thrombus has been detected in some skeletal muscle ventricles, thromboembolism to distal organs has been detected only rarely during the past few years. This research appears promising; however, skeletal muscle ventricle rupture remains a problem and currently accounts for about 30 % of the mortality in the long-term experiments.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{way of looking at the}} {{sequence}} of events leading to different styles of silicic, volcanic eruptions. Small-tomedium sized eruptions, either explosive or effusive, are explained by the ascent of isolated magma batches from mid-crustal magma chambers. We separate magma ascent into four different zones: the Supply System, the Intermediate Storage System, the Transport System and the Eruptive System. Of primary importance is the concept that ascent from the Intermediate Storage System through the Transport System to the Eruptive System first requires the development of a fracture network. Initially, this fracture network allows the ascent of individual magma batches by opening and then closing after their passage. An increase in the complexity of the fracture network with time increases the connectivity of the fractures and hence the ease of upward magma movement. In this model, the dynamics of the ensuing eruptions are controlled entirely by the time spent in the Transport System. Large explosive eruptions require a full interconnectivity of the Transport System from the Intermediate Storage System to the Eruptive System. Moreover, we suggest that a fully <b>connected</b> <b>conduit</b> is rare, develops only under particular conditions, and typically generates catastrophic eruptions during formation. Here we examine two case histories that illustrate the interplay of these processes: Mt St. Helens, USA, between 1980 and 2004, and Mt. Pinatubo, Philippines, in 199...|$|R
40|$|From a {{hydrological}} {{point of}} view, active caves are {{a series of}} <b>connected</b> <b>conduits</b> which drain water through an aquifer. Water tends to choose the easiest way through the system but different geological and morphological barriers act as flow restrictions. The number and characteristics of restrictions depends on the particular speleogenetic environment, which is a function of geological, geomorphological, climatological and hydrological settings. Such a variety and heterogeneity of underground systems has presented a challenge for human understanding for many centuries. Access to many underground passages, theoretical knowledge and recent methods (modeling, water pressure-resistant dataloggers, precise sensors etc.) give us the opportunity to get better insight into the hydrodynamic aspect of caves. In our work we tried to approach underground hydrodynamics from both theoretical and practical points of view. We present some theoretical background of open surface and pressurized flow in underground rivers and present results of some possible scenarios. Moreover, two case studies from the Ljubljanica river basin are presented in more detail: the cave system between Planinsko polje and Ljubljansko barje, and the cave system between Bloško polje and Cerkniško polje. The approach and methodology in each case is somewhat different, as the aims were different at the beginning of exploration. However, they both deal with temporal and spatial hydrodynamics of underground waters. In the case of Bloško polje-Cerkniško polje system we also explain the feedback loop between hydrodynamics and Holocene speleogenesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{drainage}} network {{of the city}} of Cossonay (Switzerland) is currently being adapted for future needs. In particular, it is required to drain increased storm discharges due to a population augmentation, and to provide an adequate concept to overcome unfavorable geotechnical conditions. Vortex drop shafts are sewer manholes commonly applied in steep urbanized topographies to <b>connect</b> <b>conduits</b> across large elevation differences. In Cossonay, the existing 48 m high vortex drop shaft, with a diameter of 1. 5 m, allowed the storm discharge to flow from the city to a watercourse issued at half of the valley height. The discharge capacity was initially assumed as 4. 1 m 3 /s, but frequent pulsations and choking phenomena implied a reduced effective capacity of around 3. 0 m 3 /s. A new planned vortex drop shaft will collect the supercritical inflows of four collectors in the old City Centre and spill them through a shaft of roughly 120 m height, restituting the flow at the valley bottom. It was pre-designed using FLOW- 3 D simulations to estimate the hydraulic features of the incoming flows and to predict the hydraulic behavior of the upper elements (before the water enters the shaft). The simulation thus included a novel junction chamber type and the steep inlet channel before the spiral intake. The numerical simulations provided a first layout of the structure that was then validated by physical model tests. The physical model was built at the Laboratory of Hydraulic Constructions (LCH) of École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) ...|$|R

Cross-well seismic {{reflection}} data, {{acquired from}} a carbonate aquifer at Port Mayaca test site near the eastern boundary of Lake Okeechobee in Martin County, Florida, {{are used to}} delineate flow units in the region intercepted by two wells. The interwell impedance determined by inversion from the seismic reflection data allows us to visualize the major boundaries between the hydraulic units. The hydraulic (flow) unit properties {{are based on the}} integration of well logs and the carbonate structure, which consists of isolated vuggy carbonate units and interconnected vug systems within the carbonate matrix. The vuggy and matrix porosity logs based on Formation Micro-Imager (FMI) data provide information about highly permeable conduits at well locations. The integration of the inverted impedance and well logs using geostatistics helps us to assess the resolution of the cross-well seismic method for detecting conduits and to determine whether these conduits are continuous or discontinuous between wells. A productive water zone of the aquifer outlined by the well logs was selected for analysis and interpretation. The ELAN (Elemental Log Analysis) porosity from two wells was selected as primary data and the reflection seismic-based impedance as secondary data. The direct and cross variograms along the vertical wells capture nested structures associated with periodic carbonate units, which correspond to connected flow units between the wells. Alternatively, the horizontal variogram of impedance (secondary data) provides scale lengths that correspond to irregular boundary shapes of flow units. The ELAN porosity image obtained by cokriging exhibits three similar flow units at different depths. These units are thin conduits developed in the first well and, at about the middle of the interwell separation region, these <b>conduits</b> <b>connect</b> to thicker flow units that are intercepted by the second well. In addition, a high impedance zone (low porosity) at a depth of about 275 m, after being converted to ELAN porosity, is characterized as a more confined low porosity structure. This continuous zone corresponds to a permeability barrier in the carbonate aquifer that separates the three <b>connected</b> <b>conduits</b> observed in the cokriging image. In the zones above and below this permeability barrier, the water production is very high, which agrees with water well observations at the Port Mayaca aquifer...|$|R
