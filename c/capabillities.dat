50|$|The Chernoprosopus was a carnivore. Mehl {{suggested}} that Chenoprosopus fed on soft organisms such as worms and the larvae of large insects of its time. There are several indications that suggest Chenoprosupus had a terrestrial life. Mehl {{states that the}} laterally directed orbits of Chenoprosopus is strongly suggestive of its terrestrial life. Also, the absence of lateral line sulci {{on the roof of}} the skull and the well ossified qualities of the postcranial skeleton also support the notion that they had a terrestrial life. The primitive tetrapod, Acanthostega gunnari (Jarvik, 1952), presents a direct biting of prey feeding mechanism and demonstrates the terrestrial mode of feeding. Unlike most terrestrial feeders among temnospondyli, Chenoprosopus, which lived in dry environments, displayed weaker bite <b>capabillities</b> than Nigerpeton, which presents strong bite capabilities. The skull of Chenoprosopus presented stresses in the posterior part of the skull than in the rest of the skull because of weak bite capabilities that could be the adductor musculature beneath the squamosal bones.|$|E
40|$|An Arrayed Wireless Sensor Network (AWSN) {{comprises}} of a {{large number}} of small self-contained packages (nodes) that contain a bank of various environmental sensors, a power and a communications module equipped with a microstrip antenna array and an array processor. Although nodes have fixed positions, they may group together under specific rules to form dynamic entities, called wireless arrays, that operate as integral communication modules. Wireless arrays are the main building blocks of the AWSN and network performance highly depends upon their capability to suppress interference, localise nodes and act as message forwarding agents. This paper is concerned with the selection of nodes for the formation of wireless arrays. This selection of nodes, determines the wireless array geometry which greatly affects the wireless array <b>capabillities</b> and consequently the overall performance of the AWSN...|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} the air {{distribution}} systems in aircraft, trains and cars still relies {{on the experience of}} the engineers and on extensive testing. However, the performance of these air distribution systems can be improved by applying numerical optimization techniques. In this paper we use adjoint Computational Fluid Mechanics to optimize a cabin outlet of the air distribution system of the Dornier 728 aircraft with the aim to develop a procedure based on which a multi-objective optimization can be performed for the complete air distribution system. With state of the art techniques for multi-objective optimization, like the weighted-sum method, the computational costs are beyond the <b>capabillity</b> when it comes to complex geometries. To avoid these high costs we present an engineering approach which is based on optimized combinations of sensitivity fields obtained with single-objective optimizations in a post-processing step. It is shown that the variation of the scaling factors allows to minimize the objective functions and to approach the utopia point. To be able to systematically vary the scaling factors a multi-objective genetic algorithm is proposed. In the last section the multi-objective problem is reformulated with an epsilon-constraints method and the variation of the scaling factors is optimized with a conjugated gradients optimization method...|$|R
40|$|Self-healing {{materials}} have the <b>capabillity</b> to repair (in an early stage) damage, that would finally lead to material failure. This repair or self-healing occurs {{with the help}} of a minor external stimulus or autonomously. Depending on the type of application one or the other is more interesting. Nature is the major source of inspiration for his type of research: living organisms already possess the property of autonomous repair of damage (wound healing, recovery of broken limbs). Although the phenomenon of self-healing has been recognized in materials throughout history, especially with regards to biological systems, it was only a few years ago that the property of self-healing was seriously considered as a desirable function for man-made materials. As such several research lines have been set up to investigate the possibilities for various application. Centexbel has looked into the possibilities of a self-healing coating suitable for textiles. In a feasibility study some commercially available products were screened to see their potential as self-healing agents in textile coatings. There was also a need to develop a method enabling to damage the textile coatings in a reproducible way. In this paper the results obtained will be presented. Eventually a textile coating formulation was developed showing autonomous self-healing properties. It was seen that this coating can also be used on non-textile substrates...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Thrombocytopenia is {{a common}} finding in chronic liver {{diseases}} and it is caused by different pathophysiological mechanisms. Immunologic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) in hepatitis C infection is a distinct clinical entity. Possible reasons for ITP in this case could be <b>capabillity</b> of HCV to induce autoimmune phenomena but also immunomodulatory effects of interferon that is used for HCV infection treatment. The specific laboratory parameters for ITP diagnosis during HCV infection have not been defined yet. Case Outline. A 37 -year-old patient diagnosed with HCV infection was treated with PEG-interferon and Ribavirin during 24 weeks. The partial response was achieved after the therapy with reduction of viral replications. One month after therapy completion, the patient was hospitalized due to skin haemorrhagic syndrome and a serious degree of thrombocytopenia (2 Ã— 109 /l). The number and megakaryocyte morphology in bone marrow aspirate were normal. An assay of thrombocyte kinetics by radioactive marker (Indium 111) showed rapid thrombocyte destruction and their early seljuestration in the spleen. Conclusion. Results of assays about thrombocyte kinetics during HCV infection show enchanced thrombocyte destruction in the liver. Accordingly, the most important parameter for ITP diagnosis in HCV infection, in this case, was rapid thrombocyte destruction and their early sequestration in the spleen approved by Indium kinetics. Also, in support of ITP is the increment of thrombocyte number during therapy with intravenous immunoglobulins. Thrombocytopenia was developing during antiviral therapy and on indirect conclusion is that viral replication is not the reason for it...|$|R

Every member of human kind, gifted with <b>capabillity</b> of self conscius, as a assertion of its own identity, is introduced with a package of defense mechanism {{in order to facilitate}} mentioned transition. Idea of its own mortallity guided the way of evolution of human psyche. And yet, remains taboo. The last taboo. All of the higher function of human mind, are connected, in some way, with this last, ultimate taboo. Death is a field on which are interlaced two extremities known to man. Idea of belonging to a specie, and idea of its own seperate identity. Death remains unavoidable, in spite of medical development. Death is still only postponed, and all of our medical systems insists on a common characteristic, dissalowance of culture of dying. Hypothetical situation of conquering the death would mean end of a specie. But yet, there still is a hope of dignity of dying, which should be attainble to every human being. Dignified way of dying has to be a right of every human being, it represents the justice equity, it is an indicator of social development, civil culture. One of the key roles in this way of meditation, surely is palliative care, with belonging infrastructure of hospice. They truly represent the ideas of altruism, and solidarity. Palliative care, marginalised, represents the answer of the idea of dissalowance of culture of death. ...|$|R
