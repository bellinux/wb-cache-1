Four meta-analyses investigating response homogeneity (cumulative N 1 650, 000) and 30 meta-analyses reporting effect sizes for 65 behavioral or psychological relationships (cumulative N 1 350, 000) provided comparative data for <b>college</b> <b>student</b> subjects and nonstudent (adult) subjects for the present research.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{experiences}} of new professionals in <b>college</b> <b>student</b> affairs as protégés in mentoring relationships. This study was designed as an exploratory study into the types of mentoring relationships that exist among <b>college</b> <b>student</b> affairs professionals, using Q methodology. The profession of <b>college</b> <b>student</b> affairs can use mentoring relationships to help recruit, train, develop, and retain high-quality individuals. Although mentoring relationships are frequently used to develop <b>college</b> <b>student</b> affairs professions, little is known about these relationships. Fifty-five new professionals in <b>college</b> <b>student</b> affairs from 29 different states sorted 39 statements describing mentoring relationships on a continuum from “least like my mentoring relationship” (- 4) to “most like my mentoring relationship” (+ 4). These 55 sorts were factor analyzed and rotated. Following these procedures, four factors emerged that represented different perspectives on mentoring relationships in <b>college</b> <b>student</b> affairs. Interpretation of these factors yielded distinct themes within them. These factors were named: (a) Mentor as Ideal, (b) Mentor as Cheerleader, (c) Mentor as Friend, and (d) Mentor as Teacher. The results of the study, which intended to elicit the subjectivity of new <b>college</b> <b>student</b> affairs professionals regarding their mentoring relationships, suggest that <b>college</b> <b>student</b> affairs professionals value, in different ways, the interaction with their mentor. The results from this study suggest the personal interaction between a protégé and a mentor is a valuable part of a protégé 2 ̆ 7 s career. Additionally, the results from this study seem to indicate that mentoring relationships in <b>college</b> <b>student</b> affairs are, on balance, positive. The results also suggest that mentoring relationships in <b>college</b> <b>student</b> affairs are highly developmental. The perspectives described and the interpretation provided in this study can greatly assist student affairs professionals in the development of new professionals...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{two studies}} {{conducted to determine}} whether there is a stigma associated with being in psychotherapy and if so, how that stigma compares with the well-documented stigma associated with mental illness (Wahl, 1995). In the first study, community members (n= 89) were asked to listen to an audiotaped statement from a young man. All participants listened to the same statement, and were either told the statement was from a <b>college</b> <b>student,</b> a <b>college</b> <b>student</b> in psychotherapy, or a <b>college</b> <b>student</b> who is mentally ill. The prediction that the <b>college</b> <b>student</b> in psychotherapy and the <b>college</b> <b>student</b> who is mentally ill would be rated similarly was partially supported. In the second study, the procedures were identical except that the participants (n= 76) were asked to read a written transcript of the same audiotaped statement. Again, the prediction that the <b>college</b> <b>student</b> in psychotherapy and the <b>college</b> <b>student</b> who is mentally ill would be rated similarly was partially supported. Results suggest that persons in psychotherapy and persons designated as mentally ill are seen as no different from each other, but very different from persons believed to be normal.
