5|$|Changes {{were made}} for the third season, with the {{introduction}} of the season long Xindi storyline. This improved the reviews that the series was receiving, and the viewers in the 18 to 35 demographics but the overall ratings continued to decrease. UPN cut the 26 episode order for the third season to 24, meaning that if 24 episodes were created for the fourth season as well then they would have the 100 episodes needed for syndication. As well as a move to Friday nights, the fourth season was shortened further to 22 episodes, meaning that at <b>cancellation</b> there were 98 episodes produced in total. At the time of <b>cancellation,</b> Enterprise remained the highest rated drama series on UPN. The series went immediately into broadcast syndication; the arrangements having been made by UPN prior to the <b>cancellation.</b> It is distributed by CBS Television Distribution.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980 presidential campaign, Ronald Reagan campaigned {{heavily on}} the {{platform}} that Carter was weak on defense, citing the <b>cancellation</b> of the B-1 program as an example, a theme he continued using into the 1980s.

40|$|This paper uses Bureau of Transportation data on 35 million {{domestic}} °ights between 1995 and 2001 {{to investigate}} the determinants of °ight <b>cancellations.</b> This paper is novel in two regards since it focuses exclusively on °ight <b>cancellations</b> and it explores the service quality and °ight revenue relationship. We ¯nd that carriers have some control over the occurrence of °ight <b>cancellations</b> given that <b>cancellations</b> are signi¯cantly less likely on Thursday, Friday, and Sunday {{and for the last}} °ight of day. There is only modest evidence that links <b>cancellations</b> with revenue...|$|R

The response to the <b>cancellation</b> was organised on websites such as TrekUnited.com. They raised money which {{was intended to be}} used for new Star Trek programming, with $48,000 raised within a month of the <b>cancellation.</b> The website sought to raise $32 million to pay for a full fifth season of the show, but failed to get close only gaining some $87,000 from general donors plus $3 million of anonymous donations from investors who work in the American spaceflight industry.

The money was refunded after an unsuccessful campaign, with reportedly only one accidental contact between TrekUnited and Paramount.|$|E
