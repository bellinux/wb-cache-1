40|$|The {{effects of}} {{variable}} daylength and temperature on <b>net</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> photosynthesis, dark respiration, and excretion of a unicellular marine haptophyte, Isochrysis galbana Parke, were examined {{and related to}} division <b>rates.</b> Six combinations <b>of</b> daylength (18 : 6, 12 : 12, 6 : 18 light:dark, LD) and temperature (20, 25 C) were used. Daily <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>net</b> photosynthesis were closely correlated to division rates, suggesting a direct relationship, and were maximal when cells were grown at 12 : 12 LD at both temperatures and 18 : 6 LD at 20 C. A daylength of 6 hours decreased daily rates by decreasing the time for carbon uptake. Further, cells grown with this daylength had maximal chlorophyll a contents, suggesting a physiological adaptation by photosynthetic units to short light periods. A photoperiod of 18 : 6 LD at 25 C decreased daily <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>net</b> photosynthesis by reducing the hourly <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>net</b> photosynthesis via an unidentified mechanism.

The substrate consisted of a 4 x 4 array of wooden trays (1. 0 -m long, 0. 5 -m wide, and 0. 1 -m deep) which contained 6 cm of sand. Any tray could {{be removed from the}} aquarium and “loaded” with a known number of prey. One bird foraged in the aquarium at a time; thus, by removing a food tray after a trial ended and counting the remaining prey, I calculated the number of prey consumed by the bird. I designed several experiments to determine if ruddy ducks abandoned a food patch {{in a manner consistent with}} the predictions of a simple, deterministic, patch depletion model. This model is based on the premise that a predator should maximize its <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>net</b> energy intake while foraging. To accomplish this, a predator should only remain in a food patch as long as its <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> energy intake from that patch exceeds the average <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> intake from the environment. In the majority of comparisons, the number of food items consumed by the ruddy ducks in these experiments was consistent with the predictions of the foraging model. When the birds did not forage as predicted by the model, they stayed in the patch longer and consumed more prey than predicted by the model. An examination of the relation between <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>net</b> energy intake and time spent foraging in the food patch indicated that by staying in a patch longer than predicted, the ruddy ducks experienced only a small deviation from maximum <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>net</b> energy intake.

40|$|Abstract. Deciduous {{species of}} Nothofagus tend to replace {{evergreen}} Nothofagus {{at the highest}} altitudes. We investigated whether deciduous Nothofagus species have higher maximum <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>net</b> photosynthesis (Pmax) and specific leaf area (SLA) than evergreen species and {{whether there is an}} increasing photosynthetic advantage (e. g. higher Pmax) in deciduous species relative to evergreen species with increasing altitude that might explain their replacement <b>of</b> evergreen species. <b>Net</b> photosynthesis was investigated in (1) five deciduous and five evergreen species ofNothofagus grown in a common environment and (2) two co-occurring species,N. gunnii (Hook. f.)

40|$|In the {{handling}} of bulk metals, it is common practice to use a sawing machine, such as a bandsaw or power hacksaw to reduce the workpiece to a manageable size for downstream processing. Recently, stationary power hacksaws have been replaced with more versatile portable electric reciprocating saws. These machines differ from bandsaws and power hacksaws {{in that they are}} portable, light-weight, and saw by rapidly reciprocating a blade over a short stroke length. In industrial applications, the speed of metal sawing is an important economic factor. The mechanics of metal sawing with traditional machines have been described in the literature, but virtually no research has been published on the mechanics of reciprocating sawing. Research was undertaken to describe metal sawing with reciprocating saws by the application of metal <b>cutting</b> mechanics. Cutting <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> metals with a reciprocating saw are dependent upon several process parameters, such as the applied pressure on the saw, the reciprocating speed of the saw blade, and the geometry of the cutting edges. An analytical model was developed to predict the <b>cutting</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> metals with a reciprocating saw. Particular attention was placed on the sawing <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> steel due to their broad commercial usage. The analytical model for reciprocating sawing rates was compared to empirical studies of important process parameters. A wear model for the cutting edges of saw blade teeth was also derived. Using a Design of Experiments technique, a test matrix was developed to determine the significance of applied thrust force and reciprocating speed on <b>cutting</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> steel.

During the steady state, Ca-Ca and Sr-Ca exchange and the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> ATP hydrolysis are much slower than the initial <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>net</b> calcium uptake and the associated ATP hydrolysis. If the accumulation of free calcium is prevented by calcium-oxalate precipitation the initial <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>net</b> calcium uptake does not decay during prolonged periods of transport.

Forest soils had higher extractable NO 3 [...] N and total inorganic N concentrations than pasture soils, but substantial NO 3 [...] N occurred in both forest and pasture soils. <b>Rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>net</b> N mineralization and net nitrification were higher in forest soils. Greater concentrations of soil organic matter in finer textured soils were associated with greater <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>net</b> N mineralization and net nitrification, but this relationship was true only under native forest vegetation; rates were uniformly low in pastures, regardless of soil type or texture. Net N mineralization and net nitrification <b>rates</b> per unit <b>of</b> total soil organic matter showed no pattern across the different forest sites, suggesting that controls <b>of</b> <b>net</b> N mineralization may be broadly similar across a wide range of soil types. Similar reductions in <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>net</b> N transformations in pastures 3 years old or older across a range of textures on these soils suggest that changes to soil N cycling caused by deforestation for pasture may be Basin-wide in extent. Lower net N mineralization and net nitrification rates in established pastures suggest that annual N losses from largely deforested landscapes may be lower than losses from the original forest. Total ecosystem N losses since deforestation are likely to depend on the balance between lower N loss rates from established pastures and the magnitude and duration of N losses that occur in the years immediately following forest clearing.

We compared soil inorganic N concentrations, <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>net</b> and gross mineralization and net and gross nitrification in a chronosequence and an experimental slash-and-burn plot in Rondônia. Soils of pastures 4, 10 and 21 -yr-old contained more NH 4 + and less NO 3 ÿ than soils of forest.
