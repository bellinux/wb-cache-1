40|$|In the {{pharmaceutical}} industry tablets are typically <b>coated</b> to improve handling, appearance, and stability. It is difficult to apply enteric or modified release coatings using current tablet <b>coating</b> techniques including pan <b>coating</b> (side-vented pan coater, SVPC) and fluid bed (Wurster) <b>coating.</b> Instead, microspheres or small beads are more commonly <b>coated</b> using Wurster Coaters or Precision CoatersTM, and these <b>coated</b> beads are filled into capsules {{in order to accomplish}} the desired drug release profile.

Males, females and calves of Siberian and North American elk all grow thin neck manes; female and young Manchurian and Alaskan wapitis do not. By early summer, the heavy winter coat has been shed, and elk are known to rub against trees and other objects to help remove hair from their bodies. All elk have small and clearly defined rump patches with short tails.

40|$|During {{the past}} 50 years, {{pharmaceutical}} <b>coating</b> {{has gone through}} the transition from sugar <b>coating</b> to organic solvent <b>coating</b> and aqueous <b>coating.</b> Since the 1990 s, aqueous <b>coating</b> has largely phased out organic solvent <b>coating</b> as the dominate <b>coating</b> method for pharmaceutical dosage forms due to the toxicity and environmental related concerns caused by the organic solvents. On the other hand, although prevailing, aqueous <b>coating</b> has other major limitations such as higher energy consumption and longer processing time than the solvent <b>coating.</b> Powder <b>coating</b> has the benefits of both, being environmentally friendly, energy efficient and short processing time, while equally effective in modifying drug release profiles. Consequently, powder <b>coating</b> is pointing to the future as the next breakthrough in pharmaceutical <b>coating.</b> Involving three steps including preheating of the dosage forms, electrostatic deposition of <b>coating</b> powders and film formation (curing), powder <b>coating</b> has been studied to tablet <b>coating</b> with easily <b>coated</b> polymers. The objectives {{of the present study}} are to expand powder <b>coating</b> to more difficult <b>coating</b> materials such as ethylcellulose and cellulose acetate, as well as more difficult dosage forms including small pellets, and in particular, osmotic controlled release tablets. As a water-insoluble polymer, ethylcellulose (EC) is a commonly used <b>coating</b> material for sustained drug release. However, {{it is very difficult to}} <b>coat</b> by powder <b>coating</b> due to its high glass transition temperature (Tg). The present study was successful to <b>coat</b> tablets with fine particles of EC in a rotatable pan coater. With the proper addition of plasticizers, a continuous and uniform <b>coating</b> film was formed. Pore forming agent was added in the <b>coating</b> formulation to adjust the permeability of the <b>coating</b> film to allow a more controlled drug release rate. Currently, small pellets are <b>coated</b> by solvent <b>coating</b> or aqueous <b>coating</b> in a fluidized bed with a larger amount of fluidizing hot air than a pan coater, leading to an extremely high energy consumption. The present study utilized the pan coater instead of a fluidized bed to <b>coat</b> small pellets with powder <b>coating,</b> leading to a significant energy savings by avoiding the use of large amount of fluidizing hot air required to fluidize those pellets and to evaporate the organic solvent or water. Three different <b>coating</b> formulations containing Eudragit® EPO, Eudragit® RS/RL and Acryl EZE were developed to achieve immediate release, sustained release and delayed release, respectively. Particularly, as the only oral drug delivery system capable of achieving constant drug release rate, osmotic drug delivery system (ODDS) is considered as the ultimate ideal drug delivery system. However, only organic solvent <b>coating</b> can be currently used to <b>coat</b> ODDS due to the high Tg of the <b>coating</b> materials. The present study successfully applied powder <b>coating</b> to <b>coat</b> ODDS with cellulose acetate (CA), resulting in a continuous, uniform and functionally acceptable <b>coating</b> film. Both elementary and porosity ODDS were achieved by using this powder <b>coating.</b> Following zero order drug release kinetics, drug release rate from powder <b>coated</b> ODDS varied with different <b>coating</b> levels while was independent with other factors such as drug delivery orifice diameter, pH vale of the release media and agitation speed. Considering that ODDS is the most promising controlled drug release system, the success of powder <b>coating</b> ODDS is a big breakthrough in pharma <b>coating.</b> To fully illustrate the powder <b>coating</b> process, in-depth characterization was carried out to investigate the <b>coating</b> powder deposition and film formation, and their influence factors. Positively related to the <b>coating</b> efficiency, powder deposition was found to be the key of the whole process, which can be promoted by preheating the dosage forms, spraying suitable liquid plasticizer and applying electrostatics for the powder spray. A curing step is necessary after <b>coating</b> powder adhesion to allow deposited particles to coalesce and form a continuous <b>coating</b> film.
