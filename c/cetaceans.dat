5|$|Baleen {{whales are}} <b>cetaceans</b> {{classified}} under the parvorder Mysticeti, and consist of four extant families: Balaenidae (right whales), Balaenopteridae (rorquals), Cetotheriidae (pygmy right whale), and Eschrichtiidae (gray whale). Balaenids are distinguished by their enlarged head and thick blubber, while rorquals and gray whales generally have a flat head, long throat pleats, {{and are more}} streamlined than Balaenids. Rorquals {{also tend to be}} longer than the latter. <b>Cetaceans</b> (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) and artiodactyls are now classified under the order Cetartiodactyla, often still referred to as Artiodactyla (given that the <b>cetaceans</b> are deeply nested with the artiodactyls). The closest living relatives to baleen whales are toothed whales both from the infraorder Cetacea.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA set of sonar system {{depending}} on acoustic signal for communication, orientation estimate, and environment identification has been formed by <b>cetacean</b> {{in the long-term}} evolving process. Compared with human development of such system, bio-sonar system is characterized by stronger anti-jamming ability, higher precision, better capability of identification, etc. It has great significance to study, analyze and classify <b>cetacean</b> sounds, {{not only for the}} protection of halobios but also for the mystery of <b>cetacean</b> and the development of the bio-sonar. This paper expounds some general methods for monitoring <b>cetacean,</b> analyzing and summarizing the characteristics of <b>cetacean</b> acoustic signals based on timefrequency analysis, which lays the foundation for the recognition of <b>cetacean</b> acoustic signals. Finally, this paper introduces two category methods which often used during the process of <b>cetacean</b> acoustic signal recognition...|$|R

5|$|By-catch is the {{incidental}} {{capture of}} non-target species in fisheries. Fixed and drift gill nets cause the highest mortality levels for both <b>cetaceans</b> and pinnipeds, however, entanglements in long lines, mid-water trawls, and both trap and pot lines are also common. Tuna seines are particularly problematic for entanglement by dolphins. By-catch affects all <b>cetaceans,</b> both small and big, in all habitat types. However, smaller <b>cetaceans</b> and pinnipeds {{are most vulnerable}} as their size means that escape once they are entangled is highly unlikely and they frequently drown. While larger <b>cetaceans</b> are capable of dragging nets with them, the nets sometimes remain tightly attached to the individual and can impede the animal from feeding sometimes leading to starvation. Abandoned or lost nets and lines cause mortality through ingestion or entanglement. Marine mammals also get entangled in aquaculture nets, however, these are rare events and not prevalent enough to impact populations.|$|E
5|$|Megalodon faced {{a highly}} {{competitive}} environment. However, its position {{at the top of}} the food chain probably had a profound impact on the structuring of marine communities. Fossil evidence indicates a correlation between megalodon and the emergence and diversification of <b>cetaceans</b> and other marine mammals. Juvenile megalodon preferred habitats where small <b>cetaceans</b> were abundant, and adult megalodon preferred habitats where large <b>cetaceans</b> were abundant. Such preferences may have developed shortly after they appeared in the Oligocene.|$|E
5|$|Most {{amphibians}} today remain semiaquatic, {{living the}} first stage of their lives as fish-like tadpoles. Several groups of tetrapods, such as the snakes and <b>cetaceans,</b> have lost some or all of their limbs. In addition, many tetrapods have returned to partially aquatic or fully aquatic lives throughout the history of the group (modern examples of fully aquatic tetrapods include <b>cetaceans</b> and sirenians). The first returns to an aquatic lifestyle may have occurred as early as the Carboniferous Period whereas other returns occurred as recently as the Cenozoic, as in <b>cetaceans,</b> pinnipeds, and several modern amphibians.|$|E
40|$|The {{consumption}} of <b>cetacean</b> meat is geographically common and often of undetermined sustainability. Besides, it can expose humans to contaminants and zoonotic pathogens. The illegality of possessing <b>cetacean</b> meat was likely under-reported {{in some countries}} {{due to lack of}} attention paid by the officials although DNA analysis of market products helped to show such practices. We developed two monoclonal antibodies against synthetic peptides of myoglobin (Mb) for constructing a rapid immune colloidal gold strip. Only <b>cetacean</b> Mb is capable of binding to both antibodies and presents positive signal while the Mb from other animals can bind only 1 of the antibodies and presents negative result. The strip for <b>cetacean</b> meat would be an applicable and cost-effective test for field inspectors and even the general public. It contributes to increase the reporting capacity and coverage of illegal <b>cetacean</b> meat possession, which has implications for global <b>cetacean</b> conservation and public health...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{requirements}} {{under the}} Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) and the Endangered Species Act (ESA),U. S. fishermen {{are required to}} take measures to reduce <b>cetacean</b> bycatch. However, the U. S. imports fisheries products from countries that have significant <b>cetacean</b> bycatch problems which fisherman are not required to mitigate. I examined case studies of the California/Oregon drift gillnet, American lobster and Atlantic cod fisheries to demonstrate the costs of U. S. <b>cetacean</b> bycatch reductions and their economic affect. The cost of <b>cetacean</b> bycatch reduction in the California/Oregon drift gillnet fishery represents 1. 9 - 4. 5 % of the fishery's total ex-vessel value. The annual cost to the lobster fishery is 0. 7 - 6. 3 % of the industry's value and 3. 3 % - 13. 3 % of the ex-vessel landings value of an Atlantic cod vessel using sink gillnets is going to <b>cetacean</b> bycatch mitigation. U. S. fishermen face a competitive disadvantage because they have to bear the costs for mitigating <b>cetacean</b> bycatch while their foreign competitors do not. The U. S. is importing products from foreign fisheries with serious bycatch problems. Foreign products are in direct competition with U. S. domestic in which U. S. fishermen have borne substantial costs to mitigate <b>cetacean</b> bycatch. The only way to protect marine mammals and maintain a competitive global fisheries market is to take action on an international level to reduce <b>cetacean</b> bycatch. To do this, influential countries like the U. S. need to support international negotiations and cooperation...|$|R

5|$|Whales are {{descendants}} of land-dwelling mammals of the artiodactyl order (even-toed ungulates). They {{are related to}} the Indohyus, an extinct chevrotain-like ungulate, from which they split approximately 48 million years ago. Primitive <b>cetaceans,</b> or archaeocetes, first took to the sea approximately 49 million years ago and became fully aquatic 5–10 million years later. What defines an archaeocete is the presence of anatomical features exclusive to <b>cetaceans,</b> alongside other primitive features not found in modern <b>cetaceans,</b> such as visible legs or asymmetrical teeth. Their features became adapted for living in the marine environment. Major anatomical changes included their hearing set-up that channeled vibrations from the jaw to the earbone (Ambulocetus 49 mya), a streamlined body and the growth of flukes on the tail (Protocetus 43 mya), the migration of the nostrils toward the top of the cranium (blowholes), and the modification of the forelimbs into flippers (Basilosaurus 35 mya), and the shrinking and eventual disappearance of the hind limbs (the first odontocetes and mysticetes 34 mya).|$|E
