The number of anchors depends on operating conditions and the refractory materials.

25|$|Irises are {{perennial}} plants, {{growing from}} creeping rhizomes (rhizomatous irises) or, in drier climates, from bulbs (bulbous irises). They have long, erect flowering stems {{which may be}} simple or branched, solid or hollow, and flattened or have a <b>circular</b> <b>cross-section.</b> The rhizomatous species usually have 3–10 basal sword-shaped leaves growing in dense clumps. The bulbous species have cylindrical, basal leaves.|$|E
25|$|The {{assumptions}} of the equation are that the fluid is incompressible and Newtonian; the flow is laminar through a pipe of constant <b>circular</b> <b>cross-section</b> that is substantially longer than its diameter; {{and there is no}} acceleration of fluid in the pipe. For velocities and pipe diameters above a threshold, actual fluid flow is not laminar but turbulent, leading to larger pressure drops than calculated by the Hagen–Poiseuille equation.|$|E

25|$|Avro first {{proposed}} {{to build the}} Avro 687 (Avro XX), which was a Lincoln bomber with a new circular section pressurized fuselage and a large single fin and rudder {{in place of the}} predecessor's double ones. During the design stage, the idea of a simple conversion was abandoned and the Avro 688 was designed, which retained the four Rolls-Royce Merlin engines. It was designed by Roy Chadwick who, due to wartime restrictions, could not design a completely new aircraft, but had to use existing parts, tools and jigs. Using the Lincoln's wing, Chadwick, who had worked on the Lancaster, designed the Tudor to incorporate a new pressurized fuselage of <b>circular</b> <b>cross-section,</b> with a useful load of 3,765lb (1,705kg) and a range of 3,975mi (6,400km).|$|E
25|$|Boeing {{submitted}} its Model 345 on 11 May 1940, {{in competition}} with designs from Consolidated Aircraft (the Model 33, later to become the B-32), Lockheed (the Lockheed XB-30), and Douglas (the Douglas XB-31). Douglas and Lockheed soon abandoned work on their projects, but Boeing received an order for two flying prototypes, given the designation XB-29, and an airframe for static testing on 24 August 1940, with the order being revised to add a third flying aircraft on 14 December. Consolidated continued to work on its Model 33 as it was seen by the Air Corps as a backup in case of problems with Boeing's design. Boeing received an initial production order for 14 service test aircraft and 250 production bombers in May 1941, this being increased to 500 aircraft in January 1942. The B-29 featured a fuselage design with <b>circular</b> <b>cross-section</b> for strength. The need for pressurization in the cockpit area also led to the B-29 being one of very few American combat aircraft of World War II to have a stepless cockpit design, without a separate windscreen for the pilots.|$|E
25|$|The United States Air Corps {{wanted the}} {{aircraft}} to perform high altitude research and {{to test the}} feasibility of a pressurized cabin. The Corps contracted with Lockheed Aircraft Corporation to produce the aircraft at a total cost of $112,197. The requirements called for an aircraft capable of flying at no less than 25,000ft (7,620m) and having an endurance of ten hours {{with at least two}} hours above 25,000ft (7,620m). Major Carl Greene and John Younger, both structures experts who worked for the Air Corps Engineering Division at Wright Field in Ohio were responsible for the design of the pressurized cabin structure. Greene and Younger worked with Lockheed to modify a Model 10 Electra with a new fuselage consisting of a <b>circular</b> <b>cross-section</b> that was able to withstand up to a 10psi differential. New, smaller windows were used to prevent a possible blowout while operating at high pressure differentials. The cabin pressurization was provided by bleeding air from the engines' turbo supercharger, the compressor outlet fed into the cabin and was controlled by the flight engineer. This system was able to maintain a cabin altitude of 12,000ft (3,658m) while flying at 30,000ft (9,144m). The fuselage was divided into two compartments, a forward pressurized compartment, and an aft unpressurized compartment. The forward compartment housed two pilots, a flight engineer, and up to two passengers. The aft compartment provided accommodation for one passenger and could be used only at low altitudes since it lacked pressurization.|$|E

40|$|Composite {{materials}} exhibiting different moduli {{in tension}} and in compression, commonly called as bimodular composites {{are being used}} in many engineering fields. A finite element analysis is carried out for small deflection static behavior of laminated curved beams of bi modulus materials for both solid and hollow <b>circular</b> <b>cross-sections</b> using an iterative procedure. The finite element has 16 d. o. f. and uses the displacement field in terms of first order Hermite in terpolation polynomials. The neutral surface, i. e. the locus of points having zero axial strain is found to vary drastically depending on the loading, lay up schemes and radius of curvature. As il lustrations, plots of the cross-sections of the ruled neutral-surface are presented {{for some of the}} investigated cases. Using this element a few problems of curved laminated beams of bimodulus materials are solved for both solid and hollow <b>circular</b> <b>cross-sections.</b> ...|$|R

500|$|The first design, the Mark I, had a {{fuselage}} with a <b>circular</b> <b>cross-section</b> and a {{small round}} window in the nose for pilot vision.

Two small bulges were located {{on the sides of the}} fuselage for the pilot's elbows. Three C-Stoff tanks surrounded the pilot, with the T-Stoff oxidizer tank in the center section between the pilot and the engine. The aircraft had straight wings, mounted at the top of the aircraft. In the dorsal area (at the wing mounts), the fuselage humped to accommodate a [...] blister for a single MK 108 [...] cannon and 60 (other writers say 45) rounds. The Walter HWK 109-509A single-chamber rocket engine was mounted beneath the aft fuselage, which also carried a twin-fin empennage and the drogue parachute housing.|$|E

This is because the light components are well distributed, even in the <b>circular</b> emission <b>cross-section</b> case.
