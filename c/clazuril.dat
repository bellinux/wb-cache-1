40|$|Coccidiostats are {{synthetic}} drugs {{administered to}} animals, especially to poultry, to cure coccidiosis. In this paper, {{we present a}} selective liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method to analyze residues of five synthetic coccidiostats in eggs: <b>clazuril,</b> diclazuril, robenidine, nicarbazin, toltrazuril and its two metabolites. The extraction efficiency was evaluated by testing several solvents, pH, different volumes and time of extraction. The clean-up procedures were optimized using different solid phase extraction cartridges and different eluants. The chromatographic separation was achieved in reversed phase using a gradient of 0. 1 % formic acid in water and acetonitrile, whereas the MS detection was performed in negative electrospray ionization (ESI) for all the analytes, except for the robenidine. The developed method has been validated according to Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /CE. The validation parameters, as linearity, precision, recovery, specificity, decision limit (CC alpha), detection capability (CC beta), and robustness have been determined. The proposed method resulted simple, fast, and suitable for screening and confirmation purposes...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work is the {{development}} of a rapid and effective analytical procedure for the determination of coccidiostats in eggs. Nicarbazin, robenidine, diclazuril, <b>clazuril,</b> toltrazuril and its metabolite were diluted by distilled water and subjected to clean-up by SPE styrene-divinylbenzene columns. Coccidiostats were eluted with methanol and determined by using HPLC-MS/MS. Separation was carried out on ODS column in gradient mode, with methanol–water mixture acidified with 0. 1 % formic acid as an eluent. Tandem mass spectrometry analysis was performed with turboion spray ionisation in positive and negative ion mode by using multi reaction monitoring (MRM). The procedure has been successfully applied for eggs during routine and confirmatory analysis. Validation was performed according to Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC criteria by determining linearity, precision, recovery, specificity, decision limit (CCα) and detection capability (CCβ). The recovery of coccidiostats ranged from 80 % to 94 %, with R. S. D. of 15 % for all coccidiostats under investigation...|$|E
40|$|International {{audience}} 1. Anticoccidials {{are widely}} used as food additives to prevent and treat coccidiosis. They are licensed {{for use in a}} prescribed concentration and during a specific time interval with broilers and pullets but not for laying hens. 2. This study was set up to develop a new high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) method to detect <b>clazuril</b> (CZ: (±) - 2 -chloro-α-(4 -chlorophenyl) - 4 -(4, 5 -dihyro- 3, 5 -dioxo- 1, 2, 4 -triazin) - 2 (3 H) -yl) -benzeneacetonitrile) in egg yolk and albumen and in plasma; to investigate both the presence of residues of CZ in eggs and its pharmacokinetic behaviour in laying hens. 3. A single oral dose (3 mg/kg BW) and a multiple oral doses (3 mg/kg BW for 5 days) were investigated. The analytical method gave very good recovery (64 - 74 %) in the three different matrices (yolk, albumen and plasma); precision and accuracy were within 11 %. 4. After a single dose no residue was detected in eggs collected for up to 10 days, while following a multiple dose treatment, CZ residues were detected until 10 days after the end of treatment. The concentration of the drug was higher in yolk than in albumen with a maximum ratio of 10 : 1. 5. Pharmacokinetics of CZ in laying hens after a single dose showed a detectable concentration of the drug up to 24 h. It reached a steady state after the third administration in multiple dosing. 6. Although further studies are necessary, these results indicate that a single oral dose of CZ could be used as an anticoccidial for laying hens {{due to the lack of}} residues in eggs...|$|E
