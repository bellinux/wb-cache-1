5|$|The first GWA study, {{conducted}} in 2005, compared 96 patients with age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) with 50 healthy controls. It identified two SNPs with significantly altered allele frequency {{between the two}} groups. These SNPs were located in the gene encoding <b>complement</b> <b>factor</b> H, which was an unexpected finding in the research of ARMD. The findings from these first GWA studies have subsequently prompted further functional research towards therapeutical manipulation of the complement system in ARMD. Another landmark publication {{in the history of}} GWA studies was the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) study, the largest GWA study ever conducted {{at the time of its}} publication in 2007. The WTCCC included 14,000 cases of seven common diseases (~2,000 individuals for each of coronary heart disease, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, bipolar disorder, and hypertension) and 3,000 shared controls. This study was successful in uncovering many new disease genes underlying these diseases.|$|E
25|$|The {{hereditary}} form (HAE) {{often goes}} undetected {{for a long}} time, as its symptoms resemble those of more common disorders, such as allergy or intestinal colic. An important clue is the failure of hereditary angioedema to respond to antihistamines or steroids, a characteristic that distinguishes it from allergic reactions. It is particularly difficult to diagnose HAE in patients whose episodes are confined to the gastrointestinal tract. Besides {{a family history of}} the disease, only a laboratory analysis can provide final confirmation. In this analysis, it is usually a reduced <b>complement</b> <b>factor</b> C4, rather than the C1-INH deficiency itself, that is detected. The former is used during the reaction cascade in the complement system of immune defense, which is permanently overactive {{due to the lack of}} regulation by C1-INH.|$|E

40|$|Background: Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) {{is one of}} the most {{important}} and lethal diseases in the world. CAD represents a board spectrum of disease from silent ischemia at one end to sudden cardiac death at the other end. The middle of this spectrum consists of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and unstable angina pectoris (UA). Recent data show that the inflammatory process plays a major role in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndrome. In this study we evaluated the difference in <b>complement</b> <b>factors</b> C 3 and C 4 between AMI and UA, and the relation between early completions of AMI and UA and the amount of C 3 and C 4. Materials and methods: In this cross – sectional analytic study, 30 patients with AMI and 30 patients with UA were compared with healthy subjects. Clinical and laboratory data were collected. Blood samples were obtained on arrival and at 12. 24 and 48 hours. electrocardiography and echocardiography were performed. All patients were monitored for 14 days after discharging from hospital. For all patients ECG was take on arrival and then daily bat. Findings: Complement activation occurred in patients with AMI and UA. In AMI activation of <b>complement</b> <b>factors</b> was significantly higher than in UA (p< 0. 01). In Qwave MI and congestive heart failure, this elevation of activity was prominent (p< 0. 01). In AMI a positive relation was found between <b>complement</b> <b>factors</b> and Cratin phospho kinas level (r= 0. 71). There was a positive relation between complement and mortality, and an inverse relation with ejection fraction (r= 0. 71). There was significant difference among <b>complement</b> <b>factors</b> in the UA, AMI, and control group (p< 0. 01). Conclusions: Elevated levels of <b>complement</b> <b>factors</b> in AMI were related to the degree of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Q-wave MI, and mortality. However, in UA, elevated levels of <b>complement</b> <b>factors</b> were unrelated, with the exception of the serum C 3 level, which was related to LVEF...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRoles of <b>complement</b> <b>factors</b> in prion {{infection}} of {{the central nervous system}} remain unclear. In this study, we assessed the strain-dependent reactivity of <b>complement</b> <b>factors</b> in prion infections of Neuro 2 a (N 2 a) cells and mouse brains. N 2 a cells persistently infected with either Chandler or 22 L scrapie strains were cultured in the presence of normal mouse serum (NMS), followed by staining with phosphatidylserine binding protein and early apoptosis marker Annexin V. The proportion of Annexin V positive cells was increased both in Chandler- and 22 L-infected cells. Preincubation of NMS with anti-C 1 q, C 3 and/or C 9 antibodies reduced Annexin V positive cells in Chandler-infected cells, while only anti-C 3 antibodies were effective on 22 L-infected cells. The immunohistochemistry showed that deposition of C 1 q and C 3 was different between Chandler- and 22 L-infected mouse brains. These results indicate that the reactivity of <b>complement</b> <b>factors</b> differs between prion strains both in vitro and in vivo...|$|R

40|$|The innate {{immune system}} is {{evolutionary}} and ancient and is the pivotal line of the host defense system to protect against invading pathogens and abnormal self-derived components. Cellular and molecular components are involved in recognition and effector mechanisms for a successful innate immune response. The complement lectin pathway (CLP) was discovered in 1990. These new components at the complement world are very efficient. Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) and ficolin not only recognize many molecular patterns of pathogens rapidly to activate complement but also display several strategies to evade innate immunity. Many studies have shown a relation between the deficit of <b>complement</b> <b>factors</b> and susceptibility to infection. The recently discovered CLP was shown {{to be important in}} host defense against protozoan microbes. Although the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by MBL and Ficolins reveal efficient complement activations, an increase in deficiency of <b>complement</b> <b>factors</b> and diversity of parasite strategies of immune evasion demonstrate the unsuccessful effort to control the infection. In the present paper, we will discuss basic aspects of complement activation, the structure of the lectin pathway components, genetic deficiency of <b>complement</b> <b>factors,</b> and new therapeutic opportunities to target the complement system to control infection...|$|R
40|$|Amyloid A {{amyloidosis}} is {{a protein}} misfolding disease characterized by deposition of extracellular aggregates {{derived from the}} acute-phase reactant serum amyloid A protein. If untreated, amyloid A amyloidosis leads to irreversible damage of various organs, including the kidneys, liver, and heart. Amyloid A deposits regress upon reduction of serum amyloid A concentration, indicating that the amyloid can be efficiently cleared by natural mechanisms. Clearance was proposed to be mediated by humoral immune responses to amyloid. Here, we report that amyloid clearance in mice lacking <b>complement</b> <b>factors</b> 3 and 4 (C 3 C 4 (-/-)) was equally efficient as in wild-type mice (C 57 BL/ 6), and was only slightly delayed in agammaglobulinemic mice (J(H-/-)).
