50|$|Galling {{is a form}} of wear {{caused by}} {{adhesion}} between sliding surfaces. When a material galls, some of it is pulled with the <b>contacting</b> <b>surface,</b> especially if there is a large amount of force compressing the surfaces together. Galling is caused by a combination of friction and adhesion between the surfaces, followed by slipping and tearing of crystal structure beneath the surface. This will generally leave some material stuck or even friction welded to the adjacent surface, whereas the galled material may appear gouged with balled-up or torn lumps of material stuck to its surface.|$|E

The {{first step in}} the algorithm simulates contact between a skin model and virtual objects, and computes the <b>contact</b> <b>surface</b> to be rendered. The accuracy of this surface is maximized by simulating soft skin with its characteristic nonlinear behavior. The second step takes the desired <b>contact</b> <b>surface</b> as input, and computes the device configuration by solving an optimization problem, i. e., minimizing the deviation between the <b>contact</b> <b>surface</b> in the virtual environment and the <b>contact</b> <b>surface</b> rendered by the device.

The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a non-invasive objective calculation system of embryo compaction in order to test the hypothesis that embryos with a larger mean <b>contact</b> <b>surface</b> result in a higher live birth rate compared to embryos with a lower mean <b>contact</b> <b>surface.</b> Methods Multilevel images of 474 embryos transferred on day 3 were evaluated by the Cellify software. This software calculates the <b>contact</b> <b>surfaces</b> between the blastomeres. The primary outcome of this study was live birth. An ideal range of <b>contact</b> <b>surface</b> was determined and the positive and negative predictive value, the sensitivity, the specificity and the area under the curve for this new characteristic were calculated. Results In total, 115 (24 %) transferred embryos resulted in a live birth. Selection of an embryo for transfer on its mean <b>contact</b> <b>surface</b> could predict live birth with a high sensitivity (80 %) and high negative predicting value (83 %) but with a low positive predictive value (27 %), a low specificity (31 %) and low area under the ROC curve (0. 56). The mean <b>contact</b> <b>surface</b> of embryos cultured in a single medium was significantly higher compared to the mean <b>contact</b> <b>surface</b> of embryos cultured in a sequential medium (p[*]=[*] 0. 0003). Conclusions Neither the mean <b>contact</b> <b>surface</b> nor the number of <b>contact</b> <b>surfaces</b> of a day 3 embryo had an additional value in the prediction of live birth. The type of culture medium, however, had an impact on the <b>contact</b> <b>surface</b> of an embryo.

50|$|A similar-looking kind {{of damage}} is called false {{brinelling}} and {{is caused by}} fretting wear. This occurs when contacting bodies vibrate {{against each other in}} the presence of very small loads, which pushes lubricant out of the contact surface area, and the bearing assembly cannot move far enough to redistribute the displaced lubricant. The result is a finely polished surface that resembles a brinell mark, but has not permanently deformed either <b>contacting</b> <b>surface.</b> This type of false brinelling usually occurs in bearings during transportation, between the time of manufacture and installation. The polished surfaces are often mistaken for brinelling, although no actual damage to the bearing exists. The false brinelling will disappear after a short break-in period of operation.|$|E

Due to {{the gravity of the}} damage caused, and the subsequent explosion in her central compartment, Dumlupınar sank within minutes. Most communications were severed along with any electrical power. The 88 surviving men inside the submarine, seeing that the vessel was taking water from the bow, tried to reach the stern to seek shelter in the torpedo room, with many of them perishing in the rapidly rising waters. Of the original 88, only 22 were able to reach and lock themselves in the stern torpedo compartment, and released an emergency communications buoy with the hope of <b>contacting</b> <b>surface</b> rescue workers.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{fundamental}} nature of fluids, a fluid cannot remain at rest under {{the presence of a}} shear stress. However, fluids can exert pressure normal to any <b>contacting</b> <b>surface.</b> If a point in the fluid is thought of as an infinitesimally small cube, then it follows from the principles of equilibrium that the pressure on every side of this unit of fluid must be equal. If this were not the case, the fluid would move {{in the direction of the}} resulting force. Thus, the pressure on a fluid at rest is isotropic; i.e., it acts with equal magnitude in all directions. This characteristic allows fluids to transmit force through the length of pipes or tubes; i.e., a force applied to a fluid in a pipe is transmitted, via the fluid, to the other end of the pipe. This principle was first formulated, in a slightly extended form, by Blaise Pascal, and is now called Pascal's law.|$|E
40|$|Suprathermal ions form a major {{component}} of the plasma within the inner coma of Comet P/Halley. A close inspection of these ions shows them to contain at least two separate populations: one population covers the energy range below about 400 eV, and a second population exists in a narrow energy band centered between 3 and 4 keV. Similar distributions are found in two regions upstream of the <b>contact</b> <b>surface.</b> It is postulated that the suprathermal ions observed upstream of the <b>contact</b> <b>surface</b> were created at the <b>contact</b> <b>surface.</b> Sudden movements of the <b>contact</b> <b>surface,</b> in the cometary frame of reference, in response to changes in the magnetic field pressure, or cometary production rate, give rise to an induction electric field able to accelerate the local thermal cometary ions up into the tens of electron volts range.

40|$|Original {{scientific}} paper The paper {{investigates the}} influence of different parameters on stress distribution in the contact area of mechanical elements. The study is aimed to determine particular positions in the contacting bodies, where small crack should be initiated due to large stresses resulting from different contact conditions. A two-dimensional equivalent contact model together with Hertzian contact theory is used for all computational analyses utilising the finite element method. The distribution of the maximum equivalent von Mises stress under the contacting area is first determined for pure Hertzian contact conditions, where the maximum stresses appear at a certain depth under the <b>contacting</b> <b>surface.</b> Then a parametric study to determine {{the influence of}} loading, contact surface curvature, contact friction, residual stresses and elasto-hydro-dynamic lubrication on the stress distribution is performed.

Multiple linear regression (MLR) modeling {{was employed to}} predict SFC and DFC on different <b>contact</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Predictive ability of developed MLR models was evaluated using some statistical parameters (coefficient of determination (R 2), {{root mean square error}} (RMSE), and mean relative deviation modulus (MRDM)). Results indicated that significant increasing DIE of treatments on SFC was 3. 2 and 3 times greater than significant increasing SE of moisture content and <b>contact</b> <b>surface,</b> respectively. In case of DFC, the significant increasing TIE of treatments was 8. 8, 3. 7, and 8. 9 times greater than SE of moisture content, <b>contact</b> <b>surface,</b> and sliding velocity, respectively.
