50|$|Organic {{fertilizers}} are a huge {{factor in}} dictating whether coffee can be certified organic. Organic fertilizers can reduce soil erosion and increase fertility by lowering bulk density. This means that farmers {{are not only}} growing healthy coffee, but they are putting vital nutrients back into their soils to help the next crop. The coffee plant has a vital nutrient it produces — <b>coffee</b> <b>pulp.</b> <b>Coffee</b> <b>pulp</b> is {{the outside of the}} plant that can be salvaged and returned to the soil as an organic fertilizer. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are the major nutrients that coffee plants need so by using the <b>coffee</b> <b>pulp,</b> cattle manure, bocachi and compost, and chicken manure and biogreen, farmers are able to supply those essential nutrients to the plant cheaper.|$|E
