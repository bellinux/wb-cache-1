5|$|The German naturalist Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger was {{the first}} to {{recognize}} the pinnipeds as a distinct taxonomic unit; in 1811 he gave the name Pinnipedia to both a family and an order. American zoologist Joel Asaph Allen reviewed the world's pinnipeds in an 1880 monograph, History of North American pinnipeds, a monograph of the walruses, sea-lions, sea-bears and seals of North America. In this publication, he traced the history of names, gave keys to families and genera, described North American species and provided synopses of species {{in other parts of the}} world. In 1989, Annalisa Berta and colleagues proposed the unranked clade Pinnipedimorpha to contain the fossil genus Enaliarctos and modern seals as a sister group. Pinnipeds belong to the order <b>Carnivora</b> and the suborder Caniformia (known as dog-like carnivorans). Pinnipedia was historically considered its own suborder under <b>Carnivora.</b> Of the three extant families, the Otariidae and Odobenidae are grouped in the superfamily Otarioidea, while the Phocidae belong to the superfamily Phocoidea.|$|E

40|$|A identificação dos grupos tróficos é {{fundamental}} para a compreensão dos fatores responsáveis pela organização e estruturação das comunidades. Nesse sentido, o presente estudo foi realizado nas poças de maré da Praia dos Castelhanos, situada no estado do Espírito Santo, região sudeste do Brasil, com o objetivo de descrever a organização trófica da comunidade de peixes, sob a hipótese de que essa organização é influenciada pelas variáveis ambientais das poças. As amostras foram coletadas em seis poças de maré, em campanhas trimestrais entre os anos de 2005 e 2007. A descrição da composição das dietas foi baseada nos valores do Índice Alimentar dos itens alimentares de doze espécies representativas do ambiente. Os principais itens das dietas foram os crustáceos bentônicos, principalmente copépodes e anfípodes, as algas, basicamente algas de tufo, e os poliquetas errantes. Por meio de análises de agrupamento a partir dos valores do Índice Alimentar dos itens que compõem a dieta de cada espécie e utilizando-se o índice de similaridade de Bray-Curtis, foram identificados oito grupos tróficos, sendo cinco de espécies <b>carnívoras,</b> dois de onívoras e um de herbívoras. Propõe-se que os principais fatores relacionados à formação desses grupos tróficos são a convergência de espécies na utilização de recursos alimentares abundantes e a variação de presas principais em função do tamanho do predador, diferenças de micro-habitat e a especialização trófica das espécies. Os resultados das análises de correlação canônica permitiram relacionar a distribuição dos grupos tróficos nas poças de maré tanto com as condições físico-químicas quanto com a interação entre a disponibilidade de micro-habitats e as relações ecológicas entre as espécies. Conclui-se que a organização trófica da comunidade de peixes de poças de maré da Praia dos Castelhanos é de fato influenciada pelas características ambientais das poças. The {{identification of}} the trophic groups is fundamental to understanding the factors responsible for organizing and structuring the communities. Accordingly, {{the present study was}} conducted in the tidepools of Praia dos Castelhanos, located in the Espírito Santo State, southeastern Brazil, in order to describe the trophic organization of the fish community, under the assumption that this organization is influenced by the environmental variables of the pools. Samples were collected at six tidepools, in quarterly campaigns between 2005 and 2007. The description of the composition of the diets was based on the Feeding Index values of the food items of twelve species representative of the environment. The main items of the diets were benthic crustaceans, mainly copepods and amphipods, algae, basically turf algae, and errant polychaetes. Through cluster analysis from the values of the Feeding Index of food items that comprising the diet of each species and using the similarity index of Bray-Curtis, eight trophic groups were identified, five of carnivorous species, two of omnivorous and one of herbivorous. It is proposed that the main factors related to the formation of these trophic groups are the species convergence in the use of abundant food resources and variation in primary prey {{depending on the size of}} the predator, differences in microhabitat and trophic specialization of the species. The results of the canonical correlation analysis allowed relating the distribution of trophic groups in the tidepools with both the physicochemical conditions and the interaction between the availability of micro-habitats and the ecological relationships between the species. It is concluded that the trophic organization of the tidepool fish community of Praia dos Castelhanos is actually influenced by the environmental characteristics of the pools...|$|R

Con la finalidad de realizar un estudio sobre las comunidades de moluscos asociadas a esta especie y sus relaciones tróficas, se llevaron a cabo muestreos bimensuales entre octubre/ 97 y agosto/ 98, en un banco natural de mejillones a dos metros de profundidad en la costa norte de la península de Araya (10 ° 40 ’N - 48 ° 63 ’W). Los organismos fueron recolectados delimitando el área con una cuadrícula de 0. 25 m². Se identificaron los organismos hasta la categoría de especies utilizando claves específicas para moluscos y bibliográficamente se les determinó categoría trófica. Se capturó un total de 1 235 individuos de P. viridis y asociados a la especie 3 163 especímenes pertenecientes al phylum Mollusca, contenidos en tres clases: Bivalvia,Gastropoda y Polyplacophora. Éstas estuvieron representadas por 50 especies correspondientes a 10 órdenes, 24 familias; para los gasterópodos se contabilizaron 25 especies, para los bivalvos 22 y tres para los poliplacóforos. Del total de las especies, 40 % fueron filtradoras, 26 % <b>carnívoras,</b> 24 % herbívoras y el 10 % restante presentó dos categorías.

Mollusc {{communities}} {{associated with}} the green mussel Perna viridis (Mollusca: Bivalvia) and their trophic relations on the north coast of Araya Peninsula, Sucre State, Venezuela. Perna viridis (Linné, 1758) is an Indo-Pacific bivalve of the intertidal zone that has invaded several ecosystems of the north coast of the Sucre State,Venezuela. Bimonthly samplings were carried out between October 1997 and August 1998 to study the mollusc communities associated with this species and their trophic relationships. Studies were conducted on a naturally-occuring bank of mussels two meters deep on the north coast of the peninsula of Araya (10 ° 40 ’N - 48 ° 63 ’W). Sample organisms were collected withing areas defined by a quadrat of 0. 25 m², and were identified to the species level using taxonomic keys that also included bibliographic identification of trophic level. A total of 1 235 individuals of P. viridis were collected, along with 3 163 specimens of associated species belonging to the phylum Mollusca, including bivalves, gastropods and polyplacophora. The associated mollusc organisms represented 50 species corresponding to 10 orders and 24 families, including 25 gastropod species, 22 bivalves and three polyplacophorans. With regard to trophic level 40 % of the 50 species were suspensivores, 26 % carnivores, 24 % herbivores and the residual 10 % represented two categories (suspensivore-detritivore, herbivore-suspensivore). Of the suspensivores the most common were: Perna perna, Musculus lateralis, Crassostrea rhizophorae and Ostrea equestris. The carnivore group was dominated by the three species of the Family Columbellidae, Mitrella lunata, Anachis obesa and Nitidella ocellata. The group of herbivores was dominated by {{two members of the}} family Fisurellidae, Diodora cayenensis and D. minuta. Two species of suspensivore-detritívore and three species of herbivore-suspensivore were also found in the genus Crepidula.

5|$|The stomach of Artiodactyls {{is divided}} into four sections: the rumen, the reticulum, the omasum and the abomasum (only {{ruminants}} have a rumen). After the plant material is consumed, it is mixed with saliva in the rumen and reticulum and separates into solid and liquid material.

Ingested food passes to the rumen and reticulum where cellulytic microbes (bacteria, protozoa and fungi) produce cellulase, which is needed to break down the cellulose in plants. Perissodactyls, in contrast to the ruminants, store digested food that has left the stomach in an enlarged cecum, where it is fermented by bacteria. <b>Carnivora</b> have a simple stomach adapted to digest primarily meat, as compared to the elaborate digestive systems of herbivorous animals, which are necessary to break down tough, complex plant fibers.

While there has been some debate as to whether all three lineages are monophyletic, i.e. descended from a single ancestor, or diphyletic, recent genetic evidence suggests all three descended from a caniform ancestor most closely related to modern bears. Recent multigene analysis indicates the odobenids and otariids diverged from the phocids about 20–26 million years ago, while the odobenids and the otariids separated 15–20 million years ago. Odobenidae was once a highly diverse and widespread family, including at least twenty species in the subfamilies Imagotariinae, Dusignathinae and Odobeninae. The key distinguishing feature was the development of a squirt/suction feeding mechanism; tusks are a later feature specific to Odobeninae, of which the modern walrus is the last remaining (relict) species.|$|E
5|$|The {{greater number}} of naturalists who have taken into {{consideration}} the whole structure of man, including his mental faculties, have followed Blumenbach and Cuvier, and have placed man in a separate Order, under {{the title of the}} Bimana, and therefore on an equality with the orders of the Quadrumana, <b>Carnivora,</b> etc. Recently many of our best naturalists have recurred to the view first propounded by Linnaeus, so remarkable for his sagacity, and have placed man in the same Order with the Quadrumana, under the title of the Primates. The justice of this conclusion will be admitted: for in the first place, we must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great development of the brain in man, and that the strongly marked differences between the skulls of man and the Quadrumana (lately insisted upon by Bischoff, Aeby, and others) apparently follow from their differently developed brains. In the second place, we must remember that nearly all the other and more important differences between man and the Quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature, and relate chiefly to the erect position of man; such as the structure of his hand, foot, and pelvis, the curvature of his spine, and the position of his head.

Em uma segunda etapa, foi avaliado o desempenho e a composição corporal de 560 juvenis (3, 06 ± 0, 20 g) estocados em gaiolas de 60 L, dentro de caixas de polietileno de 1. 000 L, instaladas em laboratório com um sistema fechado de recirculação de água com temperatura (27 o C ± 1, 07 o C) e fotoperíodo (14 L: 10 E) controlados, em um delineamento experimental totalmente ao acaso (n= 4), e alimentados ad libitum em duas refeições diárias (07 h 00 m e 17 h 00 m), durante 43 dias, com 7 dietas isonitrogenadas (40 % de PB) e isocalóricas (3. 500 kcal/kg), contendo níveis decrescentes de proteína de origem vegetal: 100 PV: 00 PA; 100 PV + 0, 02 % Fisharon ®; 80 PV: 20 PA; 60 PV: 40 PA; 40 PV: 60 PA; 50 PV: 50 PA (sem farinha de peixe); e uma dieta controle (ração comercial). A inclusão de farinha de peixe e farinha de penas foi limitada em 7 %; a inclusão de farinha de vísceras e farinha de carne em 15 %. DL-metionina (98 %) e L-lisina (80 %) foram adicionadas automaticamente através de matriz de aplicativo de formulação de ração. Em uma terceira etapa, foi avaliada a digestibilidade das rações utilizadas no experimento anterior. Para tanto, 1. 960 juvenis (14, 0 ± 1, 0 cm) foram confinados em gaiolas de polipropileno e alimentados durante 40 dias, no período diurno, com as sete dietas do experimento anterior acrescidas de 0, 5 % de óxido de cromio. No período noturno as gaiolas eram transferidas para aquários cilíndrico-cônicos de 200 L, onde as fezes eram coletadas por sedimentação em recipiente refrigerado. O farelo de soja pode ser utilizado como substituto parcial de fontes protéicas e origem animal em rações formuladas para o black bass; a farinha de vísceras pode ser considerada uma boa opção como fonte protéica de origem animal em rações. Os melhores resultados de desempenho foram relacionados aos tratamentos controle e 50 PV: 50 PA. A necessidade do uso da farinha de peixe na formulação de dietas para espécies <b>carnívoras</b> é no mínimo questionável e a determinação da digestibilidade das rações, visando maior precisão em formulações de custo mínimo para peixes carnívoros, deve ser prática corrente na indústria da alimentação de peixes. Commercial farming of carnivorous fish demands {{the use of}} a complex group of practices of production and feeding management, the reduction of the environmental impact of the feeds and the minimization of {{the use of a}}nimal protein sources in the diets. The present study investigated the use of feed stimulants in diets formulated exclusively out of plant protein, and their effects in growth performance, body composition and digestibility of the feeds for the carnivore largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, conditioned to accept dry feed. Nine hundred juvenile largemouth bass (26. 54 ± 1. 53 g) were stocked in 60, 90 -L polyethylene aquaria (15 fish/aquarium), in a totally randomized experimental design (n= 3). Fish were fed ad libitum two daily meals (0700 and 1700), for 13 days, with a basal diet (100 % plant protein) containing increasing levels of fish soluble protein  FSP (0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0, 2. 5, and 3. 0 %); Fisharom TM  FA (0. 02, 0. 04, 0. 06, 0. 08, 0. 10 and 0. 12 %); fish silage  FS (1. 0, 2. 0, 3. 0, 4. 0, 5. 0 and 6. 0 %); a positive control (10 % of fish meal) and a negative control (basal diet without stimulants). Fish fed the diet containing 0. 02 %FA presented better growth rate, weight gain and feed conversion rate, but did not differ from the other treatments (P> 0, 05). Fish fed diets containing FS as stimulant presented the poorest performance. Next, the effect of different levels of dietary plant protein in the performance and body composition of the species was evaluated. Five hundred and sixty juvenile largemouth bass (3. 06 ± 0. 20 g) were stocked in 60 -L cages, inside 1, 000 -L polyethylene tanks, installed at a laboratory with closed water-recirculating system and controled temperature (27 o C ± 1. 07 o C) and photoperiod (14 L: 10 D). Fish were fed ad libitum two daily meals (0700 and 1700), for 43 days, with 7 isonitrogenous (40 % of PB) and isoenergetic (3, 500 kcal/kg) diets, containing decreasing levels of plant protein: 100 PP: 00 AP; 100 PP + 0. 02 % Fisharom®; 80 PP: 20 AP; 60 PP: 40 AP; 40 PP: 60 AP; 50 PP: 50 AP (without fish meal); and a control diet (commercial feed). Inclusion of fish meal and feathers meal was limited to 7 %; the inclusion of poultry by-product meal and meat and bone meal to 15 %. DL methionine (98 %) and L-lysine (80 %) were added automatically through feed formulation software matrix. Trial was set up in a totally randomized experimental design (n= 4). Finally, digestibility of the diets used in the experiment 2 was studied. One thousand, nine hundred and eighty juvenile largemouth bass (14. 0 ± 1. 0 cm) conditioned to accept artificial, dry feed were confined in polypropilene cages and fed, for 40 days, in day time, with the seven experimental diets added of 0. 5 % of cromic oxide. In the night, cages were transferred to cylindrical-conical bottomed, 200 -L aquaria, where feces were collected by sedimentation into refrigerated containers. Data were submitted to the ANOVA and Tukeys test of comparison of means through statistical software package SAS (P= 0. 05). Soybean meal can be used as partial substitute of animal protein in diets for largemouth bass; the poultry by-product meal shows as a good option as animal protein source in these rations. Best performances were related to the control treatments and 50 PP: 50 AP; the need for the use of fishmeal in the formulation of diets for carnivorous species is, at least, questionable. Results of the digestibility trials demonstrated the importance of determining the digestibility of the rations, if precision in the formulation of least-cost feeds for carnivorous fish is the ultimate goal...|$|R
40|$|Atualmente a ordem Didelphimorphia apresenta uma única família, denominada Didelphidae, distribuída ao longo do continente {{americano}} (Emmons & Feer, 1997). No Brasil, são conhecidos pelo menos 15 gêneros e 65 espécies (Fonseca et al., 1996). Esse número ultrapassa 70 espécies quando considerada toda a Região Neotropical (Emmons & Feer, 1997). Os marsupiais neotropicais ocorrem desde as florestas austrais e habitats arbustivos da Patagônia, passando pelos Andes e toda extensão das florestas de planície subtropicais e tropicais, cerrados e chaco, até as regiões áridas de caatinga. Estendem-se ainda, representados por uma única espécie de gambá (Didelphis virginiana), até as regiões temperadas da América do Norte (Emmons & Feer, 1997). Os marsupiais didelfídeos ocupam uma grande variedade de nichos, sendo a maior parte dos gêneros de marsupiais neotropicais arborícolas ou ao menos escansoriais (Fonseca et al., 1996; Emmons & Feer, 1997). Podem ocupar um gradiente desde as espécies mais frugívoras, onívoras até as mais <b>carnívoras</b> (Santori & Astúa de Moraes, 2005). Essas diferenças entre as espécies nos nichos que ocupam podem permitir a coexistência de um maior número de espécies na comunidade, e devem implicar em especializações da morfologia diretamente ligadas à locomoção e à alimentação (Vieira, 2005). Estes marsupiais são remanescentes de um grupo ancestral da fauna de mamíferos terrestres que viveu durante a maior parte do Cenozóico, alcançando alta diversidade de espécies na América do Sul (Marshall & Cifelli, 1990). Os gambás e as cuícas neotropicais estão entre os mamíferos contemporâneos mais diversificados, sendo considerados um grupo de evolução mais recente (Mioceno) dentre os marsupiais (Oliveira & Goin, 2005). Os marsupiais atuais são mais arborícolas e onívoros, e isso pode ser atribuído à invasão de espécies de mamíferos placentários provenientes dos continentes do norte durante o Plioceno, o que foi chamado de 'Grande Intercâmbio Americano'. Essas espécies invasoras foram melhores competitivamente, conduzindo as espécies mais especializadas à extinção, entre elas alguns grandes marsupiais carnívoros, e colaborando para que as espécies mais arborícolas e/ou mais onívoras sobrevivessem (Webb & Rancy, 1996). Entre os gêneros conhecidos para a região neotropical, nove são compostos por espécies que usam o estrato arbóreo, mesmo que esporadicamente (Didelphis, Philander, Marmosa, Gracilinanus, Micoureus, Marmosops, Caluromys, Caluromysiops e Glironia), quatro usam exclusivamente o solo (Criptonanus, Thylamys, Monodelphis e Metachirus), ao passo que outros dois são associados a ambientes aquáticos (Lutreolina e Chironectes) (Fonseca et al., 1996; Emmons & Feer, 1997). Uma das vantagens que a vida arbórea traz é a possibilidade de se ter acesso a frutos antes que esses caiam e fiquem disponíveis no solo para outros organismos (Miranda & Passos, 2004). Para mamíferos não voadores, parece haver uma relação estreita entre a dieta do animal e o estrato vertical ocupado (Malcom, 1995; Vieira & Astúa de Moraes, 2003). Sendo assim, as espécies com maior atividade arbórea (e. g. Caluromys e Micoureus) seriam também aquelas para as quais os frutos são mais importantes na dieta (Charles Dominique, 1983; Santori & Astúa de Moraes, 2005). Devido à ampla distribuição geográfica dos marsupiais didelfídeos no Brasil, o conhecimento sobre ecologia dos membros desta família vem sendo acrescido também de informações sobre os hábitos alimentares. Os primeiros estudos no Brasil tiveram início na década de 40; contudo desde essa época até o momento, os mais variados estudos sobre dieta tratam de apenas uma pequena parcela dos marsupiais neotropicais, sendo que os biomas são pouco explorados em função de produção e disponibilidade de alimento aos marsupiais. O presente estudo aborda no primeiro capítulo, a dieta de Didelphis aurita, Micoureus paraguayanus e de Caluromys lanatus, e a relação da dieta como uso do estrato vertical e partição de recursos entre essas espécies. Após a caracterização das dietas, as relações entre disponibilidade de alimento no ambiente, amplitude alimentar e ciclo reprodutivo de D. aurita são tratados no segundo capítulo. Nestes dois capítulos, são enfocados também o oportunismo, a frugivoria e a capacidade de dispersão de sementes por estes animais. This {{study has}} the aim to analyse the diet of didelphid marsupials, namely the black-eared opossum Didelphis aurita, the woolly mouse opossum Micoureus paraguayanus {{and the western}} woolly opossum Caluromys lanatus, besides the effects of resource partitioning among these sympatric species, in a seasonal forest of southern Brazil. For this purpose, 100 live traps were set in the forest canopy (20 m apart; above 10 m in height) and other 50 (40 m apart) on the ground from August 2004 to July 2005. Species of opossums captured were identified and separated by sex, age and by their reproductive condition in order to compare diets among these classes. Their faeces were collected on the trap floor and analyzed after being washed with a 1 mm mesh. After 8, 500 trap-nights, 41 faecal samples of D. aurita, eight of M. paraguayanus and two of C. lanatus were sampled. The three species of opossum studied were heterogeneous in relation to thein diet composition, being significantly different from each other. When compared, individuals of D. aurita trapped in the canopy vs. those trapped in the floor level, or even regarding age and sex classes, {{did not differ in}} diet composition. Nevertheless, all individuals of D. aurita trapped at the canopy were young, which corroborates an observed trend to young have a larger dietary niche not a young canopy was captured while the ones on the floor were captured as young individuals as adult individuals. All species presented insects in their diets, but with a to consume fruits (both species) or vertebrates (D. aurita). Hence, D. aurita was more omnivorous, and M. paraguayanus, regarding its little faecal samples, revealed several fruit species in their diet, such as Cecropia pachystachia and Piper sp. The role of these marsupials as opportunistic consumers as well as the role of body size and habitat differences determining trends in diet are discussed. Seasonal forests have marked periods of rains and drought, and animals living there are thought to be adapted to this condition. This study aims to obtain information about relationships between availability of food resources (fruits) and biotic parameters of didelphid marsupials, such as reproduction level and fruit consumption, in a seasonal semideciduous forest of southern Brazil. This study was developed with Micoureus paraguayanus and Didelphis aurita, focusing mainly the similarities in the rhythms of consumption rather than their main differences in foraging. For this purpose, 100 live traps were set in the forest canopy (20 m apart; above 10 m in height) and other 50 (40 m apart) on the ground from August 2004 to July 2005. Their faeces were collected on a trap floor and seeds from them were identified and counted. The fruit availability in the area was quantified monthly through the collection of flesh fruits and flowers available on the ground, at 10 transect lines of 1 m in width. Because fruits of Piper do not detach usually from stems, this shrub species was sampled by counting fruiting individuals in the same 10 transect lines. Results were analyzed based on 33 faecal samples of D. aurita and eight of M. paraguayanus. Regarding fruits, diversity indexes of Shannon observed for the environment and for the marsupials species usually matched, being higher during the rainy months (November to March). Hence, rhythms of fructification of Piper sp. correlated to their consumption by marsupials (rs = 1. 00, P = 0. 04, for D. aurita and rs = 0. 40, P = 0. 60, for M. paraguayanus). There were trends to the major proportion of independent young and lactant females of D. aurita correlate to the peaks of fruit availability in the environment, mainly in November and January. Thus, the availability of resources had {{an important role in the}} reproduction and foraging behavior of the marsupial species. Marsupials are also adapted to reproduce and release young during favourable times, which matched with the warmer and rainy season at the seasonal semideciduous forest of southern Brazil...|$|R

25|$|Rila Monastery Nature Park is {{inhabited}} by 202 vertebrate species. There are 52 species of mammals.

Of them the European snow vole is a relict. The large mammals include 13 <b>Carnivora</b> and 4 Artiodactyla species. The most typical mammals in the park are the grey wolf, golden jackal, red fox, brown bear, European badger, European polecat, European otter, European pine marten, beech marten, wildcat, wild boar, red deer, roe deer and chamois.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} {{elephant seal}} (Mirounga leonina) {{is one of the}} two species of elephant seals. It is both the largest living pinniped and member of the order <b>Carnivora,</b> as well as the largest marine mammal after the cetaceans. It gets its name from its great size and the large proboscis of the adult male, which is used to make extraordinarily loud roaring noises, especially during the mating season. About 40 percent heavier than the male northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) and more than twice as heavy as the male walrus (Odobenus rosmarus), the bull {{southern elephant seal}} is without rival the largest carnivoran alive. An average adult male southern elephant seal weighs six to seven times more than the largest terrestrial carnivorans, the polar bear (Ursus maritimus) and Kodiak bear (Ursus arctos middendorffi). Additionally, it rivals the extinct giant walrus Pontolis, whose estimated weight in life was similar, as the largest carnivoran ever known.|$|E
25|$|Although grizzlies are of {{the order}} <b>Carnivora</b> and have the {{digestive}} system of carnivores, they are normally omnivores: their diets consist of both plants and animals. They {{have been known to}} prey on large mammals, when available, such as moose, elk, caribou, white-tailed deer, mule deer, bighorn sheep, bison, and even black bears; though {{they are more likely to}} take calves and injured individuals rather than healthy adults. Grizzly bears feed on fish such as salmon, trout, and bass, and those with access to a more protein-enriched diet in coastal areas potentially grow larger than inland individuals. Grizzly bears also readily scavenge food or carrion left behind by other animals. Grizzly bears will also eat birds and their eggs, and gather in large numbers at fishing sites to feed on spawning salmon. They frequently prey on baby deer left in the grass, and occasionally they raid the nests of raptors such as bald eagles.|$|E
25|$|Primates {{are well}} known for using tools for hunting or {{gathering}} food and water, cover for rain, and self-defence. Chimpanzees have been the object of study, most famously by Jane Goodall, since these animals are more-often kept in captivity than other primates and {{are closely related to}} humans. Tool-use in other primates are lesser-known as many of them are mainly observed in the wild. Many famous researchers, such as Charles Darwin in his book The Descent of Man, mentioned tool-use in monkeys (such as baboons). Both wild and captive elephants are known to create tools using their trunk and feet, mainly for swatting flies, scratching, plugging water-holes (so the water doesn't evaporate), and reaching food that is out of reach. A group of dolphins in Shark Bay use sponges to protect their beak while foraging. Sea otters will dislodge food from rocks (such as abalone) and break open shellfish. Carnivores (of the order <b>Carnivora)</b> can use tools to trap prey or break open the shells of prey, as well as for scratching.|$|E
25|$|Mutations {{in these}} repeating {{segments}} {{can affect the}} {{physical and chemical properties}} of proteins, with the potential for producing gradual and predictable changes in protein action. For example, length changes in tandemly repeating regions in the Runx2 gene lead to differences in facial length in domesticated dogs (Canis familiaris), with an association between longer sequence lengths and longer faces. This association also applies to a wider range of <b>Carnivora</b> species. Length changes in polyalanine tracts within the HoxA13 gene are linked to Hand-Foot-Genital Syndrome, a developmental disorder in humans. Length changes in other triplet repeats are linked to more than 40 neurological diseases in humans, notably triplet expansion diseases such as fragile X syndrome and Huntington's disease. Evolutionary changes from replication slippage also occur in simpler organisms. For example, microsatellite length changes are common within surface membrane proteins in yeast, providing rapid evolution in cell properties. Specifically, length changes in the FLO1 gene control the level of adhesion to substrates. Short sequence repeats also provide rapid evolutionary change to surface proteins in pathenogenic bacteria; this may allow them to keep up with immunological changes in their hosts. Length changes in short sequence repeats in a fungus (Neurospora crassa) control the duration of its circadian clock cycles.|$|E

The next three biggest orders, depending on the biological classification scheme used, are the Primates (apes and monkeys), the Cetartiodactyla (whales and even-toed ungulates), and the <b>Carnivora</b> (cats, dogs, seals, and allies).|$|E
500|$|Pinnipeds (...) (from Latin pinna [...] "fin" [...] and pes, pedis [...] "foot"), {{commonly}} known as seals, are a widely distributed and diverse clade of carnivorous, fin-footed, semiaquatic marine mammals. They comprise the extant families Odobenidae (whose only living member is the walrus), Otariidae (the eared seals: sea lions and fur seals), and Phocidae (the earless seals, or true seals). There are 33 extant species of pinnipeds, and more than 50 extinct species have been described from fossils. While seals were historically thought to have descended from two ancestral lines, molecular evidence supports them as a monophyletic lineage (descended from one ancestral line). Pinnipeds belong to the order <b>Carnivora</b> and their closest living relatives are bears and musteloids (weasels, raccoons, skunks, and red pandas), having diverged about 50 million years ago.|$|E

Bears are overwhelmingly solitary and are considered to be the most asocial of all the <b>Carnivora.</b> The only times bears are encountered in small groups are mothers with young or occasional seasonal bounties of rich food (such as salmon runs). Fights between males can occur and older individuals may have extensive scarring, which suggests that maintaining dominance can be intense.

Nuclear chromosome analysis show that the karyotype of the six ursine bears is nearly identical, with each having 74 chromosomes, whereas the giant panda has 42 chromosomes and the spectacled bear 52. These smaller numbers {{can be explained by}} the fusing of some chromosomes, and the banding patterns on these match those of the ursine species, but differ from those of procyonids, which supports the inclusion of these two species in Ursidae rather than in Procyonidae, where they had been placed by some earlier authorities.|$|E
500|$|The {{skull of}} the spotted hyena {{differs from that}} of the striped hyena by its much greater size and {{narrower}} sagittal crest.

The spotted hyena also has its carnassials situated behind its bone-crushing premolars, the position of which allows it to crush bone with its premolars without blunting the carnassials. Combined with large jaw muscles and a special vaulting to protect the skull against large forces, these characteristics give the spotted hyena a powerful bite which can exert a pressure of 80kgf/cm2 (1140 lbf/in²), which is 40% more force than a leopard can generate.
