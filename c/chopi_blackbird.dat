5000|$|Most {{bay-winged cowbird}} nests are parasitized by the {{screaming}} cowbird with parasitism rates of 74-100% recorded.Parasitism rates of 5-20% {{have been recorded}} for the brown and yellow marsh bird [...] and 46% for the <b>Chopi</b> <b>blackbird.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>chopi</b> <b>blackbird</b> (Gnorimopsar chopi) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Icteridae. It is {{monotypic}} within the genus Gnorimopsar. It is found in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay.Its natural habitats are dry savanna, subtropical or tropical seasonally wet or flooded lowland grassland, pastureland, and heavily degraded former forest.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>chopi</b> <b>{{blackbird}}</b> is 25 cm {{in length}} and has black plumage across the body. It {{is similar to the}} Forbes's blackbird but has a slightly curved bill with a groove along the lower mandible. The call is a loud explosive [...] "tjouw", either given as a single call or as a series that vary randomly in pitch.|$|E
50|$|The {{screaming}} cowbird frequently parasitizes {{its main}} host, the bay-winged cowbird, during the pre-laying period. Screaming cowbirds lay 31% of their eggs {{before the first}} bay-winged cowbird egg {{but most of the}} eggs laid are ejected, and often within 24 hours. By ejecting parasitic eggs with their feet, bay-winged cowbirds can reduce the parasitic egg load by 75%. Host species can eject an entire clutch and commence egg laying again in the same nest or abandon the nest and start afresh. <b>Chopi</b> <b>blackbirds</b> and brown and yellow marsh birds have not been observed to eject screaming cowbird eggs.|$|R
5000|$|The {{screaming}} cowbird also parasitizes {{the nests}} of the <b>chopi</b> <b>blackbird</b> (Gnorimopsar chopi) and the brown and yellow marsh bird (Pseudoleistes virescens). Parasitism {{of these other}} two species generally occurs {{in areas where the}} bay-winged cowbird is absent but can also occur in its presence. The three host species that can successfully raise screaming cowbirds are all cooperative breeders. [...] "Helpers" [...] at the nest provide assistance with chick feeding and with predator defense.|$|E
5000|$|The main host, the bay-winged cowbird, can {{successfully}} fledge 1 screaming cowbird for 3 of its own. Reproductive success, {{as the number}} of fledgling per egg laid, has been recorded to be 0.14 for the screaming cowbird when hosted by the bay-winged cowbird. When hosted by the <b>chopi</b> <b>blackbird,</b> a reproductive success rate of 0.17 was found [...] In addition, the brown and yellow marsh bird is also able to successfully rear screaming cowbird chicks.|$|E
5000|$|The male unicoloured {{blackbird}} is befitting of its name, with entirely glossy black plumage {{and dark}} eyes. However, the species exhibits sexual dimorphism; the female is streaked brown and black {{with a yellow}} belly streaked with brown. The face has a dark mask and the wings are reddish-brown edged with black. Females from the lower Amazon region and southeastern Brazil have a generally duller colouration with less rufous wings and less yellow underparts. The legs and the irids are black and the bill is long and sharply pointed. The male could {{be confused with the}} velvet-fronted grackle or the <b>chopi</b> <b>blackbird.</b> Its call of this bird is a loud [...] "tchew-tchew-tchew" [...] which is sung from an elevated position, and it also produces various trills and rattling sounds which vary in tone and pitch.|$|E
