40|$|The {{colorimetric}} {{standard of}} the present-day television system {{goes back to}} the American NTSC system from 1953. In this RGB <b>colorimetric</b> <b>system</b> it is not possible, for basic reasons, to produce a scanning device which will provide signals suitable for controlling any displayed unit. From {{the very beginning of the}} television system the scanning device has produced inevitable colour deformation. The range of reproductive colours is not fully utilized either by a contemporary Cathode Ray Tube display unit or by a Liquid Crystal Display. In addition, the range is not sufficient for true reproduction of colours. Specific technical and scientific applications in which colour bears a substantial part of the information (cosmic development, medicine) demand high fidelity colour reproduction.

Fluorochromes use might hinder a broader implementation of PNA-FISH, but colorimetric applications are inexistent so far.

The procedure was optimized and evaluated regarding sensitivity, specificity and detection limit. Results: Results have shown strong ISH signals. The method was specific, but permeabilization problems were observed for Gram-positive bacteria. Detection limit was 5 × 107 CFU/ml, limiting current applications to pre-enriched samples.

Graphs (press plate curves, single color proofs and END of single color proofs) {{have been added to}} the Kodak tone-reproduction diagram (1960) to obtain more complete steps in the analysis of the tone-reproduction and the color balance. The GATF Evaluation Method of Ink Color is tested and the GARC <b>colorimetric</b> <b>system,</b> which is a modified Adam’s chromatic value system, is used to analyze colorimetric measurement. The slightly dark reproduction, the shift of the color balance to bluish cyan in the reproduction; the shift of hues, the magenta toward red, the cyan and the green toward blue; and the desaturation of the blue, the cyan and the yellow are discovered as errors in the reproduction. The possible improvements of these errors are discussed. The hope to combine the tone-reproduction analysis, the GATF Evaluation of Ink Color and the GARC <b>colorimetric</b> <b>system</b> into one system of analysis of the color errors is not fulfilled, because the mask percentages obtained from the Evaluation of Ink Color do not agree with that of the reproduction process and the hue error and grayness of the Evaluation of Ink Color do not correspond with the visual hue and the color saturation. However, the results of the colorimetric analysis, such as hue errors and the saturation of reproduced color, correspond quite well to the visual evaluation and the results of the tone-reproduction of the colorimetric analysis can be related to the reproduction process. It is concluded that great benefit is obtained by using the three systems; the subjective evaluation, the tone-reproduction analysis and the GARC <b>colorimetric</b> <b>system</b> for the analysis of the color reproduction process...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In {{clinical}} practice, surgeons differentiate color {{changes in}} repaired cartilage compared with surrounding intact cartilage, but cannot quantify these color changes. Objective assessments are required. A spectrocolorimeter {{was used to}} evaluate whether intact and repaired cartilage can be quantified. Findings We investigated the use of a spectrocolorimeter and the application of two color models (L* a* b* <b>colorimetric</b> <b>system</b> and spectral reflectance distribution) to describe and quantify articular cartilage. In this study, we measured the colors of intact and repaired cartilage after a microfracture. Histologically, the repaired cartilage was a mixture of fibrocartilage and hyaline cartilage. In the L* a* b* <b>colorimetric</b> <b>system,</b> the L* and a* values recovered to close to the values of intact cartilage, whereas the b* value decreased over time after the operation. Regarding the spectral reflectance distribution at 12 weeks after the operation, the repaired cartilage had a higher spectral reflectance ratio than intact cartilage between wavelengths of 400 to 470 nm. Conclusion This study reports the first results regarding the relationship between spectrocolorimetric evaluation and the histological findings of repair cartilage after a microfracture. Our findings demonstrate the ability of spectrocolorimetric measurement to judge the repair cartilage after treatment on the basis of objective data such as the L*, a* and b* values and the SRP as a coincidence index of the spectral reflectance curve. </p...|$|E

An example is given of its use for the calculation of glucose concentration. The nomogram is sufficiently accurate for clinical use, and can be rapidly used. NOMOGRAMS ARE used regularly in our laboratory for various routine calculations (1). A frequent calculation, which may be performed rapidly with the nomogram presented here, is typified by the colorimetric deter-mination of glucose concentration with a reaction in which absorbance decreases as glucose concentration increases (Figure 1). The system uses an AutoAnalyzer and depends upon the reduction of yellow ferricyanide to colorless ferrocyanide (2). The linear relationship between glucose concentra-tion (x) and absorbance (y) may be expressed by the equation y = mx + b where m is the slope (negative in this case) and b is the intercept (b is the absorbance {{in the absence of}} glucose). Generally, values of y are known from the readings for standard solutions for several corresponding values x. For unknown glucose solutions, the y values are known and the x values are wanted.

Methods: A capture oligonucleotide specific for the Klebsiella phoE gene was covalently linked to tosyl activated magnetic beads. Biotinylated phoE PCR products obtained from 14 positive specimens from patients with donovanosis and isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, K rhinoscleromatis, and K ozaenae were cleaved with HaeIII {{for the purpose of}} differentiation, captured by the prepared beads, and subjected to standard EIA detection methodology. Eight samples from unrelated genital conditions underwent the same procedure. It was anticipated from the sequence data that the biotinylated fragment would be cleaved from the capture oligonucleotide target region in the three Klebsiella phoE products (that is, a negative colorimetric result) while the entire fragment of interest would remain intact in the positive C granulomatis phoE products (that is, a positive colorimetric result). Results: All 14 positive specimens from patients with donovanosis gave strong colorimetric readings with this detection system.
