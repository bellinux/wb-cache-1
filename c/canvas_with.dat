Judah {{had trouble}} landing punches effectively against Green {{for the majority}} of the fight, but in round ten, he knocked Green down with a left hook. Green beat the count, but Judah then ran across the ring and sent Green down to the <b>canvas</b> <b>with</b> a right hand, forcing the referee to stop the fight.|$|E
5|$|As soon as {{he arrived}} home, Etty began to work on {{ensuring}} he {{had at least one}} picture ready for the 1824 Summer Exhibition. He decided to return to a theme for which he had created a sketch in 1820, that of the story of Pandora and in particular the passage in Hesiod in which the seasons crown her with a wreath. He had exhibited a sketch in 1820 on the same theme, and had already decided on the arrangement of the figures. His first attempt in 1824 was abandoned half-finished, and he began again on a smaller <b>canvas</b> <b>with</b> different positioning of the key figures of Pandora, Vulcan and Venus.|$|E
5|$|On 10 March 1914, the suffragette Mary Richardson {{walked into}} the National Gallery and {{attacked}} Velázquez's <b>canvas</b> <b>with</b> a meat cleaver. Her action was ostensibly provoked by the arrest of fellow suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst the previous day, although there had been earlier warnings of a planned suffragette attack on the collection. Richardson left seven slashes on the painting, particularly causing damage to the area between the figure's shoulders. However, all were successfully repaired by the National Gallery's chief restorer Helmut Ruhemann.|$|E

5|$|Ivanović {{had left}} Vienna in 1840 {{and gone to}} study at the Munich Academy, {{possibly}} owing to Czacki's further generosity. Subsequent statements suggest that Ivanović was inspired to paint The Conquest of Belgrade around this time. Writing in 1873, she recalled how the painting came about: While studying at the Munich Academy, I started to read History of the Serb People. I wanted to paint the brave battle of Mirko on my <b>canvas.</b> <b>With</b> seven of his comrades he succeeded in entering the city at night while the Muslims were celebrating Bajram (Eid al-Fitr) and didn't even think about any danger. Mirko and his comrades killed the guards at the town gate. Their rifle shots were the signal for the others. Ivanović soon travelled to Belgrade, visited the battlesite, conversed {{with some of the}} participants in Belgrade's capture, and examined period clothing and weaponry used in the battle. She created the composition in 1844–45; it was painted in Belgrade.|$|E
5|$|On the July 4, 2008 {{episode of}} SmackDown, Edge took his frustrations out on Vickie because {{he lost the}} title and told her the wedding was off. The {{following}} week, however, after Guerrero saved Edge from a con-chair-to by The Big Show, Edge re-proposed, and the wedding was back on. On July 18, 2008 at the wedding reception, Triple H came out and showed a video of Edge cheating on Guerrero the day before with the wedding planner, Alicia Fox. The angle continued at The Great American Bash in July, when Fox attempted to hand Edge the WWE Championship belt {{to use as a}} weapon against Triple H, but was stopped by Guerrero. Edge attempted to spear Triple H but hit Guerrero instead, with the distraction, Triple H performed a Pedigree on Edge to retain the WWE title. Edge attempted to apologize to Guerrero, even though he was seen talking to Fox, but she revealed to him that she had rehired The Undertaker and that Edge would face him in a Hell in a Cell match at SummerSlam. Edge then turned on La Familia during the August 8 episode of SmackDown, performing a one-man con-chair-to on Chavo in the ring, and tossed Guerrero out of her wheelchair, effectively disbanding the faction. The following week, Edge verbally assaulted Guerrero, before he forced her to apologize to The Undertaker for what she did to him. He also mentioned to Guerrero, that it was because of her that La Familia suffered. At SummerSlam, The Undertaker defeated Edge, and after the match, Undertaker chokeslammed Edge off the top of a ladder and through the ring <b>canvas,</b> <b>with</b> flames rising from the hole.|$|E

25|$|The picture gallery {{remained}} in the convent of San Francesco even after Martini's death, surviving the Napoleonic confiscations thanks to Martini's successor, Padre Stanislao Mattei.

Today, the collection consists of 319 paintings, the majority of which are oil on <b>canvas</b> <b>with</b> some pastels and drawings.|$|E

25|$|Portrait of Jacques Nayral is an oil {{painting}} on <b>canvas</b> <b>with</b> dimensions 162 x 114cm (63.8 by 44.9 inches), inscribed ‘Albert Gleizes 1911' (lower right).

25|$|Around 1973, {{a meeting}} with the {{architect}} Louis Kahn, led him to compare the relationship between paint and <b>canvas</b> <b>with</b> that of vegetation on trellis. Jean-Max Albert then revisited the tradition of trellis-work, 18th-century utopic architecture and, finally, created vegetal architecture which came close to Land art and Environmental Sculpture. It was comparable to the work of Gordon Matta-Clark, or Nils Udo, his neighbour in the Wissenschaftszentrum exhibition in Bonn in 1979.|$|E

25|$|In 1926 he {{suffered}} an illness, {{thought to have}} been a minor stroke. In 1927 he abandoned his first name in favour of his middle name, and thereafter chose to be known as Richard Sickert.

The photographs were squared up for enlargement and transferred to <b>canvas,</b> <b>with</b> their pencil grids plainly visible in the finished paintings.|$|E
