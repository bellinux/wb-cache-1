Space-based multiprocessor computer systems linked by high speed interconnect networks offer one possible solution to this ever expanding problem. Gallium arsenide (GaAs) integrated circuits using metal-semiconductor field effect transistors (MESFETs) offer very high speed operation, reduced power consumption, and inherent radiation tolerance, which make them ideally suited to the harsh space environment. The design, simulation and layout of an 8 x 8 non-blocking <b>crosspoint</b> <b>switch</b> implemented in GaAs two-phase dynamic FET logic (TDFL) is presented in this thesis. The design of the TDFL <b>crosspoint</b> <b>switch</b> given here is a modification of a <b>crosspoint</b> <b>switch</b> design that uses GaAs direct-coupled FET logic (DCFL). Design specifics of working with GaAs are presented first, followed by detailed descriptions of the DCFL and TDFL crosspoint switches, and finally, an analysis of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} dynamic logic over static logic is presented.

40|$|Input-queued cell {{switches}} {{employing the}} oldest-cell-first (OCF) policy {{have been shown}} to yield low mean delay characteristics. Moreover, it has been proven that OCF is stable for admissible i. i. d. arrival traffic when executed with a scheduling speedup of 2. However, an increase in link rates and port densities directly leads to a decrease in packet duration times, to a point where cell-by-cell switching is no longer considered practical. To address this challenge, this paper studies frame-based scheduling algorithms for a scalable combined input-output queued (CIOQ) switch architecture. The latter is decomposed into independent subgroups, each employing multiple simple <b>crosspoint</b> <b>switches.</b> A key outcome of this decomposition is a substantial reduction of scheduling times. Unlike many other schemes, which necessitate custom integrated circuits, the architecture proposed here utilizes commercially available <b>crosspoint</b> <b>switches.</b> We present a Lyapunov-based stability analysis that dictates moderate conditions under which the switch is stable for all admissible traffic patterns. By reconfiguring the crossbar switch once every several time slots, the timing constraints imposed on the scheduling algorithm are significantly relaxed. Simulation results are presented, demonstrating the merits of the approach, particularly in the presence of bursty traffic scenarios...|$|R
