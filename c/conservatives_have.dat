5|$|Disraeli {{justified}} {{his ideas}} by {{his belief in}} an organic society in which the different classes have natural obligations to one another. He saw society as naturally hierarchical and emphasised the obligation of those at the top to those below. This was based in the feudal concept of noblesse oblige, which asserted that the aristocracy {{had an obligation to}} be generous and honourable; to Disraeli, this implied that government should be paternalistic. Unlike the New Right, one-nation conservatism takes a pragmatic and non-ideological approach to politics and accepts the need for flexible policies; one-nation <b>conservatives</b> <b>have</b> often sought compromise with their ideological opponents for the sake of social stability. Disraeli justified his views pragmatically by arguing that, should the ruling class become indifferent to the suffering of the people, society would become unstable and social revolution would become a possibility.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Trafford Council {{was created}} to {{administer}} the newly formed Trafford Metropolitan Borough and is headquartered at Trafford Town Hall, which was previously named Stretford Town Hall. On its formation in 1974, the council was controlled by the Conservative Party; the <b>Conservatives</b> <b>have</b> been in control 1973–85, 1988–94, and 2004 to the present. The only time the Labour Party was in control was 1996–2002. The {{rest of the time}} were periods of no overall control. The council meets to decide policy and allocate budget. Its duties include setting levels of council tax, monitoring the health service in Trafford, providing social care, and funding schools. John Holden is Mayor of Trafford for 2015–16.|$|E

The Conservatives pledged to increase aid spending to 0.7% of national income by 2013.

25|$|In education, the <b>Conservatives</b> <b>have</b> {{pledged to}} review the National Curriculum, and {{introduce}} the English Baccalaureate.

25|$|For {{much of the}} 20th century, the Conservative Party took {{a broadly}} Atlanticist stance in {{relations}} with the United States, favouring close ties with the United States and similarly aligned nations such as Canada, Australia and Japan.

25|$|Under the Turnbull Government, {{conservative}} {{members have}} used {{issues such as}} the Safe Schools anti-bullying program and same-sex marriage as proxy issues against the party's progressive wing following the moderate Malcolm Turnbull's successful leadership challenge to the conservative Tony Abbott. <b>Conservatives</b> <b>have</b> prevailed over progressives in the party by denying a conscience vote in the Parliament on same-sex marriage and successfully advocating for changes and the removal of federal funding to the Safe Schools program.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>conservatives</b> <b>have</b> {{intensely}} criticized Doonesbury. Several {{examples are}} {{cited in the}} Milestones section of the strip's website. The strip has also met criticism from its readers almost since it began syndicated publication. For example, when Lacey Davenport's husband Dick, in the last moments before his death, calls on God, several conservative pundits called the strip blasphemous. The sequence of Dick Davenport's final bird-watching and fatal heart attack was run in November 1986.|$|E
25|$|Kucinich was {{involved}} in efforts {{to bring back the}} Fairness Doctrine, requiring radio stations to give liberal and conservative points of view equal time, which he and other critics of talk radio argue is not presently the case. Fellow Democrat Maurice Hichney, Vermont's independent Senator Bernie Sanders, and others have joined him in this effort. <b>Conservatives</b> <b>have</b> criticized these plans, alleging that what they believe to be a liberal-dominated Hollywood, academia, new media, and mainstream media would not be subject to these regulations.|$|E

25|$|Most {{observers}} believed {{only the}} Liberals and the Conservatives {{were capable of}} forming a government in this election, although Canadian political history is not without examples of wholly unexpected outcomes, such as Ontario's provincial election in 1990. However, {{with the exception of}} the Unionist government of 1917 (which combined members of both the Conservatives and the Liberals), at the Federal stage, only Liberals or <b>Conservatives</b> <b>have</b> formed government. With the end of the campaign at hand, pollsters and pundits placed the Conservatives ahead of the Liberals.|$|E
25|$|Within the Muslim community, {{conservatives and}} Islamic feminists have used Islamic {{doctrine}} {{as the basis}} for discussion of women's rights, drawing on the Quran, the hadith, and the lives of prominent women in the early period of Muslim history as evidence. Where <b>conservatives</b> <b>have</b> seen evidence that existing gender asymmetries are divinely ordained, feminists have seen more egalitarian ideals in early Islam. Still others have argued that this discourse is essentialist and ahistorical, and have urged that Islamic doctrine not be the only framework within which discussion occurs.|$|E
25|$|The {{legislature}} has redefined congressional districts {{over the years}} to reflect population changes in the state. Districts 5 through 8 were reallocated to the 1st, 3rd and 4th. The 2nd, bounded by the Mississippi River on the west, continues to have a black-majority population. Since the 20th-century realignment of political parties in the South following passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965, which provided federal oversight and enforcement to protect voting, African-American residents here have consistently supported Democratic party candidates. Most white <b>conservatives</b> <b>have</b> shifted into the Republican Party and dominate the legislature.|$|E

25|$|Despite the sizable populations {{served by}} these programs, <b>Conservatives</b> <b>have</b> {{regularly}} targeted these programs for defunding. Conservatives' arguments against school nutrition programs include fear of wasting food and fraud from applications. On January 23, 2017, H.R.610 {{was introduced to}} the House by Republican Representative Steve King. The bill seeks to repeal a rule set by the Food and Nutrition Service of the Department of Agriculture, which mandates schools to provide more nutritious and diverse foods across the food plate. Two months later, the Trump administration released a preliminary 2018 budget that proposed a $2 billion cut from WIC.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1960s, when {{civil rights}} {{legislation}} was passed under President Lyndon Johnson to protect voting and civil rights, most African Americans in the state have affiliated with the Democratic Party. In the same years, many white social <b>conservatives</b> <b>have</b> moved to support Republican Party candidates in national, gubernatorial and statewide elections. In 2004, David Vitter was the first Republican in Louisiana to be popularly elected as a U.S. Senator. The previous Republican Senator, John S.

25|$|The electoral {{district}} {{was created in}} 1952 from the former districts of Brandon and Souris. It has been held by a centre-right party for all but one term of its existence. This tradition was broken in 1993 when massive vote-splitting between the Progressive Conservatives and Reform allowed the Liberals to sneak up the middle and take the riding. However, the seat reverted to form in 1997 when the PCs reclaimed it. The PCs and their successors, the modern <b>Conservatives,</b> <b>have</b> held the seat ever since. While Brandon has some Liberal and NDP support, {{it is not enough}} to overcome the conservative bent in the more rural areas of the riding.|$|E
