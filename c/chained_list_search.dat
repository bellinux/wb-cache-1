40|$|This study {{provides}} user evaluation of clustering and ranked <b>list</b> <b>search</b> engines by comparing their search efficiency, search effectiveness, and users' satisfaction level.

The {{results show that}} the ranked <b>list</b> <b>search</b> engine performs better in users' search speed, relevant pages retrieved, and the satisfaction level. On the other hand, the clustering search engine has the merits of demonstrating important concepts, providing clues for diverse thinking, and helping to reduce the information overload. Meanwhile, users' acceptance of individual clusters is higher than that of the cluster scheme. The paper also provides some discussions and suggestions on improving the clustering search engines...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Reengineering and {{integrated}} development platforms typically do not <b>list</b> <b>search</b> {{results in a}} particularly useful order. PageRank is the algorithm prominently used by the Google internet search engine to rank {{the relative importance of}} elements in a set of hyperlinked documents. To determine the relevance of objects, classes, attributes, and methods we propose to apply PageRank to software artifacts and their relationship (reference, inheritance, access, and invocation). This paper presents various experiments that demonstrate the usefulness of the ranking algorithm in software (re) engineering. I.

5000|$|The {{basic data}} {{structure}} of Forth is the [...] "dictionary" [...] which maps [...] "words" [...] to executable code or named data structures. The dictionary {{is laid out}} in memory as a tree of linked lists with the links proceeding from the latest (most recently) defined word to the oldest, until a sentinel value, usually a NULL pointer, is found. A context switch causes a <b>list</b> <b>search</b> to start at a different leaf. A linked <b>list</b> <b>search</b> continues as the branch merges into the main trunk leading eventually back to the sentinel, the root.There can be several dictionaries. In rare cases such as meta-compilation a dictionary might be isolated and stand-alone.The effect resembles that of nesting namespaces and can overload keywords depending on the context.|$|R

In-order to solve this problem a scalable server architecture called presence cloud has been introduced. To provide security to the above server architecture SSL protocol is used.
