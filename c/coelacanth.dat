5|$|The {{tetrapods}} {{have their}} {{root in the}} early Devonian tetrapodomorph fish. Primitive tetrapods developed from an osteolepid tetrapodomorph lobe-finned fish (sarcopterygian-crossopterygian), with a two-lobed brain in a flattened skull. The <b>coelacanth</b> group represents marine sarcopterygians that never acquired these shallow-water adaptations. The sarcopterygians apparently took two different lines of descent and are accordingly separated into two major groups: the Actinistia (including the coelacanths) and the Rhipidistia (which include extinct lines of lobe-finned fishes that evolved into the lungfish and the tetrapodomorphs).|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to bony fish, {{with the exception}} of the <b>coelacanth,</b> the blood and other tissue of sharks and Chondrichthyes is generally isotonic to their marine environments because of the high concentration of urea (up to 2.5%) and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), allowing them to be in osmotic balance with the seawater. This adaptation prevents most sharks from surviving in freshwater, and they are therefore confined to marine environments. A few exceptions exist, such as the bull shark, which has developed a way to change its kidney function to excrete large amounts of urea. When a shark dies, the urea is broken down to ammonia by bacteria, causing the dead body to gradually smell strongly of ammonia.|$|E
50|$|In the Early Devonian (416 - 397 Mya), the sarcopterygians {{split into}} two main {{lineages}} — the <b>coelacanths</b> and the rhipidistians. <b>Coelacanths</b> never left the oceans and their heyday was the late Devonian and Carboniferous, from 385 to 299 Ma, as they were more common during those periods {{than in any other}} period in the Phanerozoic; <b>coelacanths</b> still live today in the oceans (genus Latimeria).|$|R

The discovery of presences of <b>Coelacanths</b> made the region world-famous.|$|R
40|$|Acoustic {{telemetry}} {{was used}} to examine patterns of activity and space utilisation of <b>coelacanths,</b> nocturnal predators which spend the day in submarine caves. Nine <b>coelacanths</b> (Latimeria chalumnae) were tracked, each for a period of 1 to 16 nights at Grande Comore, West Indian Ocean. Activities lasted on average 9 [*]h, usually starting shortly after sunset and ending before sunrise. Vertically, <b>coelacanths</b> moved up and down at and below cave level by following the bottom contour, mainly between 180 and 400 [*]m depth. The deepest record was 698 [*]m, the shallowest 133 [*]m. Most time was spent between 200 and 300 [*]m depth. Large individuals performed deep excursions to depths below 400 [*]m, usually once per night. The fish spent most time in water temperatures of 15 to 19 [*]°C; they rarely ventured into waters warmer than 22 [*]°C measured at depths shallower than 160 [*]m depth. Horizontally, <b>coelacanths</b> stayed in narrow areas ranging from < 1 to 10 [*]km of coastline. <b>Coelacanths</b> are extremely slow drift-hunters with an estimated average swimming speed of 3. 2 [*]m[*]min− 1, often travelling not more than 3 [*]km per night. They probably take advantage of local upwelling and downwelling and slow currents occurring parallel to the steep slopes. This study shows that <b>coelacanths</b> are inhabitants of the subphotic zone, where they are active mainly below the depth of their daytime refuges...|$|R
5|$|The {{first major}} groups of {{amphibians}} {{developed in the}} Devonian period, around 370 million years ago, from lobe-finned fish which were similar to the modern <b>coelacanth</b> and lungfish. These ancient lobe-finned fish had evolved multi-jointed leg-like fins with digits that enabled them to crawl along the sea bottom. Some fish had developed primitive lungs to help them breathe air when the stagnant pools of the Devonian swamps were low in oxygen. They could also use their strong fins to hoist themselves {{out of the water}} and onto dry land if circumstances so required. Eventually, their bony fins would evolve into limbs and they would become the ancestors to all tetrapods, including modern amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Despite being able to crawl on land, many of these prehistoric tetrapodomorph fish still spent most of their time in the water. They had started to develop lungs, but still breathed predominantly with gills.|$|E
5|$|The {{nostrils}} in most bony fish {{differ from}} those of tetrapods. Normally, bony fish have four nares (nasal openings), one naris behind the other on each side. As the fish swims, water flows into the forward pair, across the olfactory tissue, and out through the posterior openings. This is true not only of ray-finned fish but also of the <b>coelacanth,</b> a fish included in the Sarcopterygii, the group that also includes the tetrapods. In contrast, the tetrapods have only one pair of nares externally but also sport a pair of internal nares, called choanae, allowing them to draw air through the nose. Lungfish are also sarcopterygians with internal nostrils, but these are sufficiently different from tetrapod choanae that they have long been recognized as an independent development.|$|E
5|$|All {{vertebrates}} have {{a similar}} basic body plan {{and at some point}} in their lives, mostly in the embryonic stage, share the major chordate characteristics; a stiffening rod, the notochord; a dorsal hollow tube of nervous material, the neural tube; pharyngeal arches; and a tail posterior to the anus. The spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column and is above the notochord and the gastrointestinal tract is below it. Nervous tissue is derived from the ectoderm, connective tissues are derived from mesoderm, and gut is derived from the endoderm. At the posterior end is a tail which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut. The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal, and the anus at the base of the tail. The defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the vertebral column, formed in the development of the segmented series of vertebrae. In most vertebrates the notochord becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs. However, a few vertebrates, such as the sturgeon and the <b>coelacanth</b> retain the notochord into adulthood. Jawed vertebrates are typified by paired appendages, fins or legs, which may be secondarily lost. The limbs of vertebrates are considered to be homologous because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor. This is one of the arguments put forward by Charles Darwin to support his theory of evolution.|$|E
25|$|<b>Coelacanths</b> {{belong to}} the {{subclass}} Actinistia, a group of lobed-finned fish related to lungfish and certain extinct Devonian fish such as osteolepiforms, porolepiforms, rhizodonts, and Panderichthys. <b>Coelacanths</b> were thought to have become extinct in the Late Cretaceous, around 66 million years ago, but were rediscovered in 1938 {{off the coast of}} South Africa.|$|R
40|$|There is {{very little}} {{reported}} data concerning reproduction and hormones of reproduction for the two living groups of sarcopterygian fishes, the <b>coelacanths</b> and the lungfishes. In general terms, <b>coelacanths</b> are viviparous and lungfishes are oviparous. Both are large fishes and very long-lived. They inhabit the warmer latitudes of the southern hemisphere, the <b>coelacanths</b> being confined to the more even conditions of the deep oceans and the lungfishes to the very variable conditions of subtropical freshwater streams and rivers. Their differing modes of reproduction are described in this chapter and some comparisons with other vertebrates are made. 6 page(s...|$|R

5|$|The common {{ancestor}} of all present gnathostomes (jawed-vertebrates) lived in freshwater, and later migrated {{back to the}} sea. To deal with the much higher salinity in sea water, they evolved the ability to turn the nitrogen waste product ammonia into harmless urea, storing it in the body to give the blood the same osmolarity as the sea water without poisoning the organism. This is the system currently found in cartilaginous fishes. Ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii) later returned to freshwater and lost this ability, while the fleshy-finned fishes (Sarcopterygii) retained it. Since the blood of ray-finned fishes contains more salt than freshwater, they could simply get rid of ammonia through their gills. When they finally returned to the sea again, they did not recover their old trick of turning ammonia to urea, {{and they had to}} evolve salt excreting glands instead. Lungfishes do the same when they are living in water, making ammonia and no urea, but when the water dries up and they are forced to burrow down in the mud, they switch to urea production. Like cartilaginous fishes, the <b>coelacanth</b> can store urea in its blood, as can the only known amphibians that can live {{for long periods of time}} in salt water (the toad Bufo marinus and the frog Rana cancrivora). These are traits they have inherited from their ancestors.|$|E
25|$|Latimeria {{is a rare}} genus of {{fish that}} {{includes}} two extant species: West Indian Ocean <b>coelacanth</b> (Latimeria chalumnae) and the Indonesian <b>coelacanth</b> (Latimeria menadoensis). They follow the oldest known living lineage of Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fish and tetrapods), which means they are {{more closely related to}} lungfish, reptiles and mammals than to the common ray-finned fishes. They are found along the coastlines of the Indian Ocean and Indonesia. Since there are only two species of <b>coelacanth</b> and both are threatened, it is the most endangered genus of animals in the world. The West Indian Ocean <b>coelacanth</b> is a critically endangered species.|$|E
25|$|In July 1998, {{the first}} live {{specimen}} of Latimeria menadoensis {{was caught in}} Indonesia. Approximately 80 species of <b>coelacanth</b> have been described, including the two extant species. Before {{the discovery of a}} live specimen, the <b>coelacanth</b> time range was thought to have spanned from the Middle Devonian to the Upper Cretaceous period. Although fossils found during that time were claimed to demonstrate a similar morphology, recent studies have expressed the view that <b>coelacanth</b> morphologic conservatism is a belief not based on data.|$|E

They bear a superficial similarity to the living Latimeria, though they were smaller, and had more elongated heads. Individuals grew up to 3 feet in length, and had small lobed fins, suggesting that Coelacanthus were open-water predators.|$|R

25|$|<b>Coelacanth</b> {{locomotion}} is unique. To {{move around}} they most commonly {{take advantage of}} up- or down-wellings of current and drift. Their paired fins stabilize movement through the water. While on the ocean floor, they do not use the paired fins {{for any kind of}} movement. Coelacanths create thrust with their caudal fins for quick starts. Due to the abundance of its fins, the <b>coelacanth</b> has high maneuverability and can orient its body in almost any direction in the water. They have been seen doing headstands as well as swimming belly up. It is thought that the rostral organ helps give the <b>coelacanth</b> electroperception, which aids in movement around obstacles.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to their}} lobed fins and other features, {{it was once}} thought that the <b>coelacanth</b> was the most recent shared {{ancestor}} between terrestrial and marine organisms.
