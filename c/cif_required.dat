40|$|How do {{you select}} {{the most useful}} and {{appropriate}} usability measures? If {{the purpose of the}} test is to decide whether a product has adequate usability (the type of test the CIF is intended for), measures should focus on the end result (as defined in ISO 9241 - 11) : • Effectiveness: “accuracy and completeness. ” Error-free completion of tasks is important in both business and consumer applications. • Efficiency: “resources expended. ” How quickly a user can perform work is critical for business productivity. • Satisfaction: “positive attitudes toward the use of the product. ” Satisfaction is a success factor for any products with discretionary use; it’s essential for maintaining workforce motivation. This is a black-box view of usability: what is achieved, rather than how. The <b>CIF</b> <b>requires</b> as a minimum measures of the percentage of participants achieving each task goal, the mean time taken to complete each task, and a measure of user satisfaction. Other common usability measures such as frequency of errors, frequency of assists, an...|$|R
50|$|This term is broadly {{similar to}} the above CFR term, with the {{exception}} that the seller is required to obtain insurance for the goods while in transit to the named port of destination. <b>CIF</b> <b>requires</b> the seller to insure the goods for 110% of their value under at least the minimum cover of the Institute Cargo Clauses of the Institute of London Underwriters (which would be Institute Cargo Clauses (C)), or any similar set of clauses. The policy {{should be in the}} same currency as the contract. The seller must also turn over documents necessary, to obtain the goods from the carrier or to assert claim against an insurer to the buyer. The documents include (as a minimum) the invoice, the insurance policy, and the bill of lading. These three documents represent the cost, insurance, and freight of CIF. The seller's obligation ends when the documents are handed over to the buyer. Then, the buyer has to pay at the agreed price. Another point to consider is that CIF should only be used for non-containerized seafreight; for all other modes of transport it should be replaced with CIP.|$|R
40|$|Background: Intestinal failure (IF) is the {{reduction}} in functioning gut mass below the minimal level necessary for adequate digestion and absorption of nutrients and fluids for weight maintenance in adults or for growth in children. There is a paucity of epidemiologic data on pediatric IF. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the prevalence, incidence, regional distribution and underlying diagnosis of pediatric chronic IF (<b>CIF)</b> <b>requiring</b> home parenteral nutrition (HPN) in Italy. Methods: Local investigators were selected in 19 Italian centers either of reference for pediatric HPN or having pediatric gastroenterologists or surgeons on staff and already collaborating with the Italian Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition with regard to IF. Data requested in this survey for children at home on Parenteral Nutrition (PN) on 1 December 2016 included patient initials, year of birth, gender, family’s place of residence and underlying diagnosis determining IF. Results: We recorded 145 CIF patients on HPN aged ≤ 19 years. The overall prevalence was 14. 12 /million inhabitants (95 % CI: 9. 20 – 18. 93); the overall incidence was 1. 41 /million inhabitant years (95 % CI: 0. 53 – 2. 20). Conclusion: Our survey provides new epidemiological data on pediatric CIF in Italy; these data may be quantitatively useful in developing IF care strategy plans in all developed countries...|$|R

50|$|The type of {{insurance}} contract {{depends on the}} Incoterm adopted by the parties in a sale contract. A <b>CIF</b> sale contract <b>requires</b> the seller to obtain insurance cover for the voyage. An FOB contract however places no obligation on the buyer or seller to obtain insurance, although it is prudent for the buyer to protect against potential losses. It {{is not uncommon for}} the buyer in a FOB contract to request the seller to arrange insurance on an understanding that they will reimburse the insurance costs incurred.|$|R
40|$|Prediction of cause-specific {{cumulative}} incidence function (CIF) is of primary interest to clinical researchers when conducting statistical analysis involving competing risks. The predicted CIFs {{need to be}} dynamically updated by incorporating the time-dependent information measured during follow-up. However, dynamic prediction of the conditional <b>CIFs</b> <b>requires</b> simultaneously updating the overall survival and the CIF while adjusting for the time-dependent covariates and the time-varying covariate effects which is complex and challenging. In this study, we extended the landmark Cox models to data with competing risks, because the landmark Cox models provide {{a simple way to}} incorporate various types of time-dependent information for data without competing risks. The resulting new models are called landmark proportional subdistribution hazards (PSH) models. In this study, we first investigated the properties of the Fine-Gray model under non-PSH and proposed a robust risk prediction procedure which is not sensitive to the PSH assumption. Then, we developed a landmark PSH model and a more comprehensive landmark PSH supermodel. The performance of our models was assessed via simulations and through analysis of data from a multicenter clinical trial for breast cancer patients. As compared with other dynamic predictive models, our proposed models exhibited three advantages. First, our models are robust against violations of the PSH assumption and can directly predict the conditional CIFs bypassing the estimation of overall survival and greatly simplify the prediction procedure. Second, our landmark PSH supermodel enables users to make predictions with a set of landmark points in one step. Third, the proposed models can simply incorporate various types of time-varying information. Finally, our models are not computationally intensive and can be easily implemented with existing statistical software. Public Health Significance: Prognostic models for predicting the absolute risk of a patient in having a disease are very useful in performing risk stratification and making treatment decisions. Since the patient’s prognosis can change over time, it is necessary to update the risk prediction accordingly. The dynamic prediction models developed in this study can provide more accurate prognoses over the course of disease progression and will be helpful to physicians in adopting personalized treatment regimes...|$|R
40|$|Methods to {{automatically}} extract Open Data from the chemical literature, validate it, {{and use it}} to validate theory are examined. Chemical identifiers which assist the automatic location of chemical structures using commercial Web search engines are investigated. The IUPAC International Chemical Idenfitifer (InChI) gives almost 100 % recall and precision, though is shown to be too long for present search engines. A combination of InChI and InChIKey, a shorter, fixed-length hash of the InChI string, is concluded to be the best current method of identifying structures. The proportion of published, Open Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs) that are valid with respect to the specification is shown to be improving, and is around 99 % in 2007. The error rate in the conversion of valid CIFs to Chemical Markup Language (CML) is less than 0. 2 %. The machine generation of connection tables from <b>CIFs</b> <b>requires</b> many heuristics, and in some cases it is impossible to deduce the exact connection table. CrystalEye, a fully-automated system for the reformulation of the fragmented crystallographic Web into a structured XML-based repository is described. Published, Open CIFs can be located and aggregated programmatically with almost 100 % recall. It is shown that, by converting CIF data to CML, software can be created to use the latest Web standards and technologies to enhance the ability of Web users to browse, find, keep updated, download and reuse the latest published crystallography. A workflow for the high-throughput calculation of solid-state geometry using a semi-empirical method is described. A wide-range of organic and inorganic systems provided by CrystalEye are used to test both the data and the method. Several errors in the method are discovered, many of which {{can be attributed to the}} parameterization process. An Open NMR experiment to perform high-throughput prediction of 13 C chemical shifts using a GIAO protocol is described. The data and analysis were provided on publicly-available webpages to enable crowdsourcing, which assisted in discovering an error rate of 6. 1 % in the starting data. The protocol was refined during the work and shown to have an average unsigned error of 2. 24 ppm for 13 C nuclei of small, rigid molecules; comparable to the errors observed elsewhere for general structures using HOSE and Neural Network methods...|$|R
40|$|The Compositional Interchange Format (CIF), is a {{modeling}} formalism for hybrid systems, {{that aims}} to establishing interoperability {{of a wide range}} of tools by means of model transformations to and from CIF. UPPAAL is a very successful tool for the specification and analysis of timed systems. It is interesting, both from a theoretical and a practical perspective, to be able to translate CIF models to UPPAAL models, since this makes it possible to model check properties of timed <b>CIF</b> models. This <b>requires</b> a semantic preserving transformation, which ensures that properties validated in UPPAAL models also hold for their CIF counterparts. In addition, by providing such a translation we are, at the same time, providing translations for a wider set of languages that can be transformed to CIF. This paper presents a semantic-preserving transformation from a subset of CIF models to UPPAAL. The transformation described in this work constitutes the cornerstone for transformations of a broader subset of CIF...|$|R
40|$|The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) compact {{inflorescence}} (cif) genotype causes altered adult vegetative {{development and}} a reduction in elongation of inflorescence internodes resulting in formation of floral clusters. The <b>cif</b> trait <b>requires</b> both a recessive mutation, cif 1, and the activity of a naturally occurring dominant allele of an unlinked gene, CIF 2 D. We show here that the pseudoverticillata mutation is allelic with cif 1 and that the product of the CIF 1 gene is ACA 10, a member of the large family of P-type Ca 2 +-ATPases found in higher plants. T-DNA insertion mutations in ACA 10, but not in the two other Arabidopsis plasma membrane Ca 2 +-ATPase-encoding genes, ACA 8 and ACA 9, cause a cif phenotype when combined with the dominant CIF 2 D modifier allele. Therefore, ACA 10 has a unique function in regulating adult phase growth and inflorescence development. The wild-type ACA 8 and ACA 10 mRNAs are present at similar levels, and the two promoter-β-glucuronidase fusion transgenes show very similar expression patterns. Moreover, transformation of the cif mutant with an extra copy of the ACA 8 gene, which causes overexpression of the ACA 8 transcript, can complement the cif phenotype. This suggests that these two Ca 2 + pump genes have distinct but related activities and that their differential functions can be altered by relatively small changes in their patterns or levels of expression. The correspondence between cif 1 and mutations in ACA 10 establishes a genetic link between calcium transport, vegetative phase change, and inflorescence architecture...|$|R
40|$|Background & aims Chronic Intestinal Failure (CIF) is the {{long-lasting}} {{reduction of}} gut function, below the minimum {{necessary for the}} absorption of macronutrients and/or water and electrolytes, such that intravenous supplementation is required to maintain health and/or growth. CIF is the rarest organ failure. Home parenteral nutrition (HPN) is the primary treatment for CIF. No guidelines (GLs) have been developed that address the global management of CIF. These GLs have been devised to generate comprehensive recommendations for safe and effective management of adult patients with CIF. Methods The GLs were developed by the Home Artificial Nutrition & Chronic Intestinal Failure Special Interest Group of ESPEN. The GRADE system was used for assigning strength of evidence. Recommendations were discussed, submitted to Delphi rounds, and accepted in an online survey of ESPEN members. Results The following topics were addressed: management of HPN; parenteral nutrition formulation; intestinal rehabilitation, medical therapies, and non-transplant surgery, for short bowel syndrome, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, and radiation enteritis; intestinal transplantation; prevention/treatment of CVC-related infection, CVC-related occlusion/thrombosis; intestinal failure-associated liver disease, gallbladder sludge and stones, renal failure and metabolic bone disease. Literature search provided 623 full papers. Only 12 % were controlled studies or meta-analyses. A total of 112 recommendations are given: grade of evidence, very low for 51 %, low for 39 %, moderate for 8 %, and high for 2 %; strength of recommendation: strong for 63 %, weak for 37 %. Conclusions <b>CIF</b> management <b>requires</b> complex technologies, multidisciplinary and multiprofessional activity, and expertise to care for both the underlying gastrointestinal disease and to provide HPN support. The rarity of the condition impairs the development of RCTs. As a consequence, most of the recommendations have a low or very low grade of evidence. However, two-thirds of the recommendations are considered strong. Specialized management and organization underpin these recommendations. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the methods}} {{proposed}} by the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the volume reduction and stabilization {{of a variety of}} low-level radioactive wastes (LLW) is incineration. Many commercial incinerators are in operation treating both non-hazardous and hazardous wastes. These can obtain volume reductions factors of 50 or more for certain wastes, and produce a waste (ash) that can be easily stabilized if necessary by vitrification or cementation. However, there are few incinerators designed to accommodate radioactive wastes. One has been recently built at the Savannah River Site (SRS) near Aiken, SC and is burning non-radioactive hazardous waste and radioactive wastes in successive campaigns. The SRS Consolidated Incineration Facility (CIF) is RCRA permitted as a Low Chemical Hazard, Radiological facility as defined by DOE criteria (Ref. 1). Accordingly, the CIF must operate within specified chemical, radionuclide, and fissile material inventory limits (Ref. 2). The radionuclide and fissile material limits are unique to radiological or nuclear facilities, and require special measurement and removal strategies to assure compliance, and the <b>CIF</b> may be <b>required</b> to shut down periodically in order to clean out the radionuclide inventory which builds up {{in various parts of the}} facility...|$|R
