2500|$|For {{women with}} infections of mild to {{moderate}} severity, parenteral and oral therapies are prescribed [...] Typical antibiotics used are <b>cefoxitin</b> or cefotetan plus doxycycline, and clindamycin plus gentamicin. An alternative parenteral regimen is ampicillin/sulbactam plus doxycycline. Once infection has been eliminated, surgery may be successful in opening the lumen of the fallopian tubes to allow a successful pregnancy and birth.|$|E
2500|$|Among Gram-negative bacteria, the {{emergence}} of resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins {{has been a major}} concern. It appeared initially in a limited number of bacterial species (C. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens, and P. aeruginosa) that could mutate to hyperproduce their chromosomal class C β-lactamase. A few years later, resistance appeared in bacterial species not naturally producing AmpC enzymes (K. pneumoniae, Salmonella spp., P. mirabilis) due to the production of TEM- or SHV-type ESBLs. Characteristically, such resistance has included oxyimino- (for example ceftizoxime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime, as well as the oxyimino-monobactam aztreonam), but not 7-alpha-methoxy-cephalosporins [...] (cephamycins; in other words, <b>cefoxitin</b> and cefotetan); has been blocked by inhibitors such as clavulanate, sulbactam, or tazobactam, and did not involve carbapenems and temocillin. Chromosomal-mediated AmpC β-lactamases represent a new threat, since they confer resistance to 7-alpha-methoxy-cephalosporins (cephamycins) such as <b>cefoxitin</b> or cefotetan are not affected by commercially available β-lactamase inhibitors, and can, in strains with loss of outer membrane porins, provide resistance to carbapenems.|$|E
2500|$|The {{classification}} of cephalosporins into [...] "generations" [...] is commonly practised, although the exact categorization is often imprecise. For example, the fourth generation of cephalosporins is not recognized as such in Japan. In Japan, cefaclor is classed as a first-generation cephalosporin, {{though in the}} United States it is a second-generation one; and cefbuperazone, cefminox, and cefotetan are classed as second-generation cephalosporins. Cefmetazole and <b>cefoxitin</b> are classed as third-generation cephems. Flomoxef and latamoxef are in a new class called oxacephems.|$|E
2500|$|In general, an isolate is {{suspected}} {{to be an}} ESBL producer when it shows in vitro susceptibility to the second-generation cephalosporins (<b>cefoxitin,</b> cefotetan) but resistance to the third-generation cephalosporins and to aztreonam. Moreover, one should suspect these strains when treatment with these agents for Gram-negative infections fails despite reported in vitro susceptibility. Once an ESBL-producing strain is detected, the laboratory should report it as [...] "resistant" [...] to all penicillins, cephalosporins, and aztreonam, {{even if it is}} tested (in vitro) as susceptible. Associated resistance to aminoglycosides and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, as well as high frequency of co-existence of fluoroquinolone resistance, creates problems. Beta-lactamase inhibitors such as clavulanate, sulbactam, and tazobactam in vitro inhibit most ESBLs, but the clinical effectiveness of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations cannot be relied on consistently for therapy. Cephamycins (<b>cefoxitin</b> and cefotetan) are not hydrolyzed by majority of ESBLs, but are hydrolyzed by associated AmpC-type β-lactamase. [...] Also, β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations may not be effective against organisms that produce AmpC-type β-lactamase. [...] Sometimes these strains decrease the expression of outer membrane proteins, rendering them resistant to cephamycins. In vivo studies have yielded mixed results against ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae. (Cefepime, a fourth-generation cephalosporin, has demonstrated in vitro stability in the presence of many ESBL/AmpC strains.) Currently, carbapenems are, in general, regarded as the preferred agent for treatment of infections due to ESBL-producing organisms. Carbapenems are resistant to ESBL-mediated hydrolysis and exhibit excellent in vitro activity against strains of Enterobacteriaceae expressing ESBLs.|$|E
50|$|In a 2005 study, Fernandes et al. {{determined}} that <b>cefoxitin</b> {{serves as an}} appropriate replacement for methicillin in determining if a bacteria displays methicillin resistance. Likewise, Funsun et al. found in a 2009 study that <b>cefoxitin</b> disk assays correctly identified all 60 mecA-positive Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA isolates, to be resistant to <b>cefoxitin.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cefoxitin</b> is a {{beta-lactam}} antibiotic which binds penicillin binding proteins, or transpeptidases. By binding to PBPs, <b>cefoxitin</b> {{prevents the}} PBPs from forming the cross-linkages between the peptidoglycan layers {{that make up}} the bacterial cell wall, thereby interefering with cell wall synthesis. It is a strong beta-lactamase inducer, as are certain other antibiotics (such as imipenem). However, <b>cefoxitin</b> is a better substrate than imipenem for beta-lactamases.|$|E
50|$|Minor drug {{interactions}} do not usually require {{a change in}} treatment. Your doctor may monitor specific events, such as bleeding, while taking <b>cefoxitin.</b> Two such minor interactions occur between <b>cefoxitin</b> and heparin as well as genistein.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cefoxitin</b> is a second-generation cephamycin {{antibiotic}} {{developed by}} Merck & Co., Inc. from Cephamycin C {{in the year}} following its discovery, 1972. It was synthesized {{in order to create}} an antibiotic with a broader spectrum. It is often grouped with the second-generation cephalosporins. <b>Cefoxitin</b> requires a prescription and as of 2010 is sold under the brand name Mefoxin by Bioniche Pharma, LLC. The generic version of Mefoxin is known as <b>cefoxitin</b> sodium.|$|E
5000|$|Due, in part, to the {{unavailability}} of methicillin in the United States, <b>cefoxitin</b> {{has replaced}} methicillin for disk diffusion tests, which determine {{the sensitivity of}} a bacterial specimen to a given antibiotic. <b>Cefoxitin</b> also yields more accurate results for disk diffusion tests. Interpretive criteria for determining susceptibility to <b>cefoxitin</b> via disk diffusion are {{greater than or equal}} to 22mm resulting in a [...] "susceptible" [...] result for Staphylococcus aureus and {{greater than or equal to}} 25mm for coagulase-negative staphylococci to be considered susceptible.|$|E
50|$|Susceptible to amikacin, imipenem, <b>cefoxitin,</b> {{clarithromycin}} and ciprofloxacin.|$|E
50|$|In the {{presence}} of <b>cefoxitin,</b> bacteria that make beta-lactamases will increase their production and secretion to cleave the beta lactam ring. As a cephamycin, <b>cefoxitin</b> is highly resistant to hydrolysis by some beta-lactamases, {{in part due to}} {{the presence}} of the 7-alpha-methoxy functional group (see skeletal formula above).|$|E
50|$|<b>Cefoxitin</b> {{has many}} other uses; {{it may be}} given prior to surgery to prevent the {{development}} of surgical wound infections, and when used in third and fourth degree perineal injuries in women after giving vaginal birth, <b>cefoxitin</b> decreases infection rate at two and six weeks. However, the earlier and more times a child is exposed to <b>cefoxitin,</b> as with early and multiple exposure to many antibiotics, the greater the likelihood of developing inflammatory bowel disease later in life. This may be {{due in part to}} a decreased variety of microorganisms in the digestive system.|$|E
5000|$|Side {{effects for}} <b>cefoxitin</b> are {{regarded}} as mild. Common side effects include: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Cefoxitin</b> is sold {{in three}} major IV doses, 1g, 2g, and 10g. It is usually given to adults every six to eight hours in 1g or 2g doses. <b>Cefoxitin</b> may {{interfere}} with tests detecting urine glucose and result in a false positive. As with any antibiotic, {{it should not be}} given to patients who are allergic to it.|$|E
50|$|Another more {{efficient}} form {{of resistance to}} <b>cefoxitin</b> {{is provided by the}} mecA gene in bacteria. This gene codes for an alternative penicillin binding protein, PBP2a. This PBP has a lower binding affinity for penicillin-based antibiotics such as cefotxitin and will continue to cross-link the peptidoglycan layers of the cell wall even {{in the presence of the}} beta-lactam antibiotics. MRSA, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a strain that has acquired resistance to <b>cefoxitin</b> via this gene. For the purposes of detecting bacterial strains with the mecC gene, which like mecA codes for a different PBP, <b>cefoxitin</b> is more reliable than oxacillin because mecC does not correlate as strongly with oxacillin resistance.|$|E
50|$|The type strain {{isolates}} were susceptible {{in vitro}} to ciprofloxacin, amikacin, tobramycin, <b>cefoxitin,</b> clarithromycin, doxycycline, sulfamethoxazole and imipenem.|$|E
50|$|A {{contraindication}} {{means that}} the drug in question {{should not be used}} under particular circumstances. For <b>cefoxitin,</b> this includes patients who are hypersensitive to cephalosporin antibiotics.|$|E
50|$|Individuals {{on a low}} sodium diet, {{undergoing}} dialysis, or {{who have}} experienced seizures, particularly following antibiotic therapy, should also consult their physician prior to taking <b>cefoxitin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Pharmocokinetic (PK) and {{pharmacodynamic}} (PD) {{data for}} <b>cefoxitin</b> are, as of 2013, considered limited and outdated. A few relatively {{recent studies have}} attempted to remedy that.|$|E
50|$|Aside {{from the}} {{above-mentioned}} contraindications and diseases which require monitoring by a doctor, the live cholera and live typhoid vaccines {{are known to}} have a severe interaction with <b>cefoxitin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Patients with colitis, kidney disease, or {{liver disease}} are also advised {{not to take}} <b>cefoxitin.</b> However, some drug {{databases}} will considers the diseases means for caution rather than contraindications.|$|E
50|$|The type strain is {{susceptible}} to amikacin and sulfamethoxazole, intermediately {{susceptible to}} doxycycline and ciprofloxacin, variably susceptible to cefmetazole, <b>cefoxitin,</b> chloramphenicol and clarithromycin, and resistant to isoniazid, rifampin and tobramycin.|$|E
50|$|While <b>cefoxitin</b> has {{not been}} {{associated}} with alcohol incompatibility like {{other members of the}} second generation cephalosporins class, it has been with a higher risk of coagulopathy, a bleeding disorder.|$|E
5000|$|For {{women with}} PID of mild to {{moderate}} severity, parenteral and oral therapies appear to be effective. [...] It does not matter to their short- or long-term outcome whether antibiotics are administered to them as inpatients or outpatients. Typical regimens include <b>cefoxitin</b> or cefotetan plus doxycycline, and clindamycin plus gentamicin. An alternative parenteral regimen is ampicillin/sulbactam plus doxycycline. Erythromycin-based medications can also be used. Another alternative {{is to use a}} parenteral regimen with ceftriaxone or <b>cefoxitin</b> plus doxycycline. [...] Clinical experience guides decisions regarding transition from parenteral to oral therapy, which usually can be initiated within 24-48 hours of clinical improvement.|$|E
5000|$|The {{available}} parenteral antimicrobials {{for most}} infections are metronidazole, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, <b>cefoxitin,</b> a penicillin (i.e. ticarcillin, ampicillin, piperacillin) and a beta-lactamase inhibitor (i.e. clavulanic acid, sulbactam, tazobactam), and a carbapenem (imipenem, meropenem, doripenem, ertapenem). An antimicrobial effective against Gram-negative enteric bacilli (i.e. aminoglycoside) or an anti-pseudomonal cephalosporin (i.e. cefepime [...] ) are generally added to metronidazole, and occasionally <b>cefoxitin</b> when treating intra-abdominal infections to provide coverage for these organisms. Clindamycin {{should not be}} used as a single agent as empiric therapy for abdominal infections. Penicillin can be added to metronidazole in treating of intracranial, pulmonary and dental infections to provide coverage against microaerophilic streptococci, and Actinomyces.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cefoxitin,</b> and the cephamycin {{family as}} a whole, served as a {{branching}} point and impulsed the discovery of more classes of beta-lactams. This is {{in part due to}} their primary and early discovery in the broths studied.|$|E
50|$|Only take {{additional}} antibiotics, anticoagulants {{and blood}} thinners under doctor supervision. <b>Cefoxitin</b> may decrease {{the effectiveness of}} hormonal birth control. This increases the risk for pregnancy and a medical consult will help determine whether backup birth control methods should be used.|$|E
50|$|This {{followed}} a 2012 French {{study on the}} same E. coli strain with CTX-M-15 extended release beta-lactamase. Lepeule et al. determined that in mice, the ideal pharmacodynamic target of fT>MIC=33%, where MIC is the minimum inhibitory concentration, was obtained with 200 mg/kg every four hours. The fT>MIC (%) was increased by 11% when the administration frequency was increased from every four hours to every three hours. This implied that increasing the frequency might yield similar results in humans. The study also found {{no significant difference between}} the effectiveness of carbapenems and <b>cefoxitin</b> and suggested that <b>cefoxitin</b> can be used as an alternative treatment for CTX-M producing E. coli to carbapenems such as imipenem and ertapenem.|$|E
50|$|Groups {{of doctors}} at Merck, {{particularly}} Eli Lilly {{and his group}} discovered Cephamycin C while looking at penicillin-producing bacteria. This followed their discovery of erythromycin, another antibiotic. Cephamycin C was the first cephem discovered but while it was highly resistant {{to a lot of}} beta-lactamases-as is its derivative cefoxitin-it was almost only effective against Gram negative bacteria. The scientists used chemistry to modify the compound, which gives <b>cefoxitin</b> the title of semi-synthetic since a biological product is altered to artificially synthesize it. This new modification broadened its spectrum to include Gram positive bacteria. More than 300 modifications were made to it and tested on the cephalosporin base with methoxy groups at the 7-alpha position. Yet <b>cefoxitin</b> was the compound that was successful in keeping its previous effectiveness against Gram negative bacteria, developed effectiveness against Gram positive bacteria, and was resistant to breakdown by beta-lactamase.|$|E
50|$|It is {{also used}} to treat pelvic {{inflammatory}} disease, because it is a broad spectrum antibiotic. For outpatient treatment, oral antibiotics or those with less frequent dosing may be prescribed. As an effective alternative to penicilin and spectinomycin, and replacement for methicillin, <b>cefoxitin</b> is used to treat gonorrhea in both men and women with few side effects.|$|E
50|$|Cefoxitin's {{spectrum}} of in vitro antimicrobial activity includes {{a broad range}} of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including anaerobes. It is inactive against most strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and many strains of Enterobacter cloacae. Staphylococci that are resistant to methicillin and oxacillin should also be considered clinically resistant to <b>cefoxitin</b> even if they test susceptible by in vitro methods.|$|E
5000|$|For mild-to-moderate community-acquired {{infections in}} adults, the agents {{recommended}} for empiric regimens are: ticarcillin- clavulanate, <b>cefoxitin,</b> ertapenem, moxifloxacin, or tigecycline as single-agent therapy or combinations of metronidazole with cefazolin, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, levofloxacin, or ciprofloxacin. Agents no longer recommended are: cefotetan and clindamycin ( [...] Bacteroides fragilis group resistance) and ampicillin-sulbactam (E. coli resistance) and ainoglycosides (toxicity).|$|E
5000|$|Strains of M. goodii show {{rapid growth}} on Middlebrook 7H10 and trypticase soy agar at 30°C, 35°C and 45°C within 2-4 days. They are {{susceptible}} to the antibiotics amikacin, ethambutol, and sulfamethoxazole but show intermediate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, doxycycline and tobramycin and variable susceptibility to cefmetazole, <b>cefoxitin</b> and clarithromycin. They are resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin.|$|E
5000|$|For {{women with}} infections of mild to {{moderate}} severity, parenteral and oral therapies are prescribed [...] Typical antibiotics used are <b>cefoxitin</b> or cefotetan plus doxycycline, and clindamycin plus gentamicin. An alternative parenteral regimen is ampicillin/sulbactam plus doxycycline.
