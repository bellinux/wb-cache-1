50|$|On April 24, 2008, Landry lost a tooth in Game 3 of the 2008 NBA Playoffs {{against the}} Utah Jazz. In that same game, {{he made a}} last second <b>clutch</b> game-winning <b>block</b> on Deron Williams to seal the much needed win for the Rockets, 94-92.|$|R
50|$|A plate <b>clutch</b> was <b>blocked</b> {{with the}} engine. Power was {{transmitted}} {{by a long}} shaft with universal joints to the three-speed sliding-gear manual gearbox with reverse. This was located in a housing at the rear axle which also contained the differential. The car used shaft drive from the beginning, although many other high-powered cars at this time relied on double-chain drive.|$|R
50|$|The seventh {{match was}} between Dustin Runnels and Val Venis (accompanied by Terri Runnels). Venis {{performed}} a spinebuster, but Runnels {{came back with}} a powerbomb. Venis knocked Runnels outside and attacked Runnels. As they re-entered the ring, Runnels performed a back body drop, but Venis fought back with a Russian legsweep, and applied the camel <b>clutch.</b> Runnels <b>blocked</b> a suplex into his own suplex, but Venis {{came back with a}} chinlock. Runnels fought back with a DDT and climbed the turnbuckles, but Venis threw him to the outside. They then went back and forth until Venis performed a powerslam, several elbow drops, and pinned Runnels after a Money Shot.|$|R
50|$|Synchromesh {{transmission}} {{was introduced}} by Cadillac in 1928. If the dog teeth {{make contact with the}} gear, but the two parts are spinning at different speeds, the teeth will fail to engage and a loud grinding sound will be heard as they clatter together. For this reason, a modern dog clutch in an automobile has a synchronizer mechanism or synchromesh, which consists of a cone <b>clutch</b> and <b>blocking</b> ring. Before the teeth can engage, the cone clutch engages first, which brings the selector and gear to the same speed using friction. Until synchronization occurs, the teeth are prevented from making contact, because further motion of the selector is prevented by a blocker (or baulk) ring. When synchronization occurs, friction on the blocker ring is relieved and it twists slightly, bringing into alignment certain grooves or notches that allow further passage of the selector which brings the teeth together. The exact design of the synchronizer varies among manufacturers.|$|R
50|$|While in {{the process}} of {{catching}} the sheep, the Riders end up turning it in to an impromptu competition against each other in getting as many sheep as possible; they all arrive back at the pen and discover they all got three sheep each. Astrid points out that there is no winner in this 'competition'. Sven then cries out, alarmed that his prized black sheep is still missing and hoping that it didn't fall down the well again. At the mention of this, the Riders declare the black sheep as a tiebreaker. Hiccup states that it isn't a competition, but it falls on deaf ears: with the exception of Fishlegs, the others have already taken off. Moments later, Snotlout and Hiccup both spot the sheep, and they race towards it head on. Just as Hiccup is about to grab the sheep in his <b>clutches,</b> Gobber <b>blocks</b> his path and they collide, allowing Snotlout to claim the black sheep. Hiccup asks Gobber what's so urgent, and as he tries to remember Stoick calls Hiccup to come meet him, which was what Gobber was about to inform Hiccup about.|$|R
40|$|When I was young, {{my mother}} would press a bouquet of pansies in my hand to carry to school. “Give these to your teacher, ” she would say. I walked three <b>blocks,</b> <b>clutching</b> these {{delicate}} flowers, watching them with care {{to make sure they}} survived the walk to the school. This gesture on her part gave me an attitude towards teachers and school. I give this bouquet to all who have gone before [...] . and to those will come after. Acknowledgements I especially want to acknowledge Pattye Henderson who helped shape the research questions for this study. Through her work and others at the KPM Institute, I have learned of the value of education based on the fundamental dignity of the individual...|$|R
5|$|Olajuwon led the Rockets to a {{championship}} in the 1994 NBA Finals in a seven-game {{series against the}} New York Knicks, the team of one of Olajuwon's perennial rivals since his collegiate days, Patrick Ewing. After being down 2–1, the Knicks took a 3–2 lead into Game 6. The Rockets were defending an 86–84 lead when in the last second, Knicks guard John Starks (who had already scored 27 points) went up for {{what would have been}} a Finals-winning three. Olajuwon pulled off a <b>clutch</b> play by <b>blocking</b> the shot as time expired. In Game 7, Olajuwon posted a game–high 25 points and 10 rebounds, which helped defeat the Knicks, bringing the first professional sports championship to Houston since the Houston Oilers won the American Football League championship in 1961. Olajuwon dominated Ewing in their head–to–head match-up, outscoring him in every game of the series and averaging 26.9 points per game on 50% shooting, compared to Ewing's 18.9 and 36.3%. For his efforts Olajuwon was named NBA Finals Most Valuable Player.|$|R
