The test case milled a forged blank for a <b>Crown</b> <b>Wheel</b> <b>Gear</b> on an older Mazak VQC 20. Accuracy data from the machine was combined with tool engagement information from the STEP-NC to predict the deflections, which were tested against actual machining results.|$|R

50|$|A hypoid {{is a type}} of {{spiral bevel}} gear whose axis does not {{intersect}} with the axis of the meshing gear. The shape of a hypoid gear is a revolved hyperboloid (that is, the pitch surface of the hypoid gear is a hyperbolic surface), whereas the shape of a spiral bevel gear is normally conical. The hypoid gear places the pinion off-axis to the <b>crown</b> <b>wheel</b> (ring <b>gear)</b> which allows the pinion to be larger in diameter and have more contact area. In hypoid gear design, the pinion and gear are practically always of opposite hand, and the spiral angle of the pinion is usually larger than that of the gear. The hypoid pinion is then larger in diameter than an equivalent bevel pinion.|$|R

40|$|Scania has {{experienced}} difficulties with large {{variations of the}} slope of the back plane after press quenching of case hardened <b>crown</b> <b>wheels</b> of especially type R 780 Steg supplied from ingot cast material. This leads to {{that a large number of}} <b>crown</b> <b>wheels</b> has to be remeasured and sorted according to back slope which is time consuming for operators. Also, after sorting of the <b>crown</b> <b>wheels,</b> hard machining has to be adjusted according to the different slopes of the back plane of the <b>crown</b> <b>wheels.</b> In some cases, it also leads to scrapping of the <b>crown</b> <b>wheels.</b> This master’s thesis was divided in two parts. The aim of the first part was to confirm that the <b>crown</b> <b>wheel</b> type and casting technique that exhibits the largest variations in slope of the back plane is the R 780 Steg originating from ingot cast material. The <b>crown</b> <b>wheel</b> types that were compared were the R 780 Steg, R 780 Slät and R 885 Slät. <b>Crown</b> <b>wheels</b> manufactured from ingot cast material and from continuous cast material were compared. Hence, 6 combinations were examined. The slope of the back plane was measured with the measuring probe FARO after press quenching. The slope of the <b>crown</b> <b>wheels</b> was found to depend on both casting technique and the geometry of the <b>crown</b> <b>wheel.</b> The results confirmed that the <b>crown</b> <b>wheel</b> type and supplier combination that by far yields the largest variations in slope of the back plane is the R 780 Steg supplied by Steel Plant A who uses the ingot casting technique. For this combination the variation exceeds 0, 1 mm. All other combinations of <b>crown</b> <b>wheels</b> and suppliers yield acceptable variations. The second part of this master’s thesis was composed of determining if segregations in the cast ingot are the cause of the variations in slope of the back plane of the <b>crown</b> <b>wheel</b> type R 780 Steg. This was done by measuring if there is a correlation between {{the slope of the}} back plane of the <b>crown</b> <b>wheel</b> after press quenching, the chemical composition and the original position of the <b>crown</b> <b>wheel</b> in the ingot. As in the first part of the study, the distortion was measured by the measuring probe FARO. The samples were sent to Degerfors Laboratorium for chemical analysis. Analyses of C, S and N were made by using combustion analyses. For As, P, B and Al optic spectrometry (spark) was used. All other elements were analysed by x-ray fluorescence. Segregations were found to be present and in combination with the geometry of R 780 Steg to be the cause of the large variations in slope of the <b>crown</b> <b>wheels.</b> The results of this thesis show that, for the <b>crown</b> <b>wheel</b> type R 780 Steg, Scania should not use suppliers that employ the ingot casting technique. Instead, only suppliers using the continuous casting technique should be used. However, for the other <b>crown</b> <b>wheel</b> types ingot or continuously cast material can be used...|$|R
