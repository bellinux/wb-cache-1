5000|$|When the <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> pin {{is held in}} the {{inactive}} state, {{the chip}} or device is [...] "deaf", and pays no heed {{to changes in the}} state of its other input pins; it holds its outputs in the high impedance state, so other chips can drive those signals. When the <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> pin is held in the active state, the chip or device assumes that any input changes it [...] "hears" [...] are meant for it, and responds as if it is the only chip on the bus. [...] Because the other chips have their <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> pins in the inactive state, their outputs are high impedance, allowing the single <b>selected</b> <b>chip</b> to drive its outputs.|$|R

25|$|SPI {{controllers}} {{from different}} vendors support different feature sets; such DMA queues are not uncommon, {{although they may}} be associated with separate DMA engines rather than the SPI controller itself, such as used by multichannel buffered serial port (MCBSP). Most SPI master controllers integrate support for up to four <b>chip</b> <b>selects,</b> although some require <b>chip</b> <b>selects</b> to be managed separately through GPIO lines.|$|R
25|$|In the {{independent}} slave configuration, {{there is an}} independent <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> line for each slave. A pull-up resistor between power source and <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> line is highly recommended for each independent device to reduce cross-talk between devices. This is the way SPI is normally used. Since the MISO pins of the slaves are connected together, {{they are required to}} be tri-state pins (high, low or high-impedance).|$|R

50|$|When an {{engineer}} needs to connect several devices {{to the same}} set of input wires (e.g., a computer bus), but retain the ability to send and receive data or commands to each device independently of the others on the bus, they can use a <b>chip</b> <b>select.</b> The <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> is a command pin on many integrated circuits which connects the I/O pins on the device to the internal circuitry of that device.|$|R
25|$|All ranks are {{connected}} to the same memory bus (address+data). The <b>Chip</b> <b>Select</b> signal is used to issue commands to specific rank.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Chip</b> <b>Select.</b> When this {{signal is}} high, the chip ignores all other inputs (except for CKE), and acts as if a NOP command is received.|$|R
50|$|When <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> is asserted, {{the chip}} {{internally}} performs the access, {{and only the}} final output drivers are disabled by deasserting output enable. This can be done while the bus is in use for other purposes, and when output enable is finally asserted, the data will appear with minimal delay. A ROM or static RAM chip with an output enable line will typically list two access times: one from <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> asserted and address valid, and a second, shorter time beginning when output enable is asserted.|$|R
25|$|Every slave on the {{bus that}} has not been {{activated}} using its <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> line must disregard the input clock and MOSI signals, and must not drive MISO.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{approaches}} {{the problem of}} control and selecting possibilities offered by the PC parallel port. Although {{it is the most}} frequently used PC port for controlling external applications, the parallel port has severe limitations in generating <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> and control signals. Their number can be increased by using the parallel port data lines, extra hardware and specific routines. Higher speed can be obtained if the EPP and ECP modes are used. Techniques for increasing the number of <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> and control signals generated by the PC parallel port are presented and analyzed...|$|R
25|$|Below is {{an example}} of bit-banging the SPI {{protocol}} as an SPI master with CPOL=0, CPHA=0, and eight bits per transfer. The example is written in the C programming language. Because this is CPOL=0 the clock must be pulled low before the <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> is activated. The <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> line must be activated, which normally means being toggled low, for the peripheral {{before the start of the}} transfer, and then deactivated afterward. Most peripherals allow or require several transfers while the select line is low; this routine might be called several times before deselecting the chip.|$|R

50|$|Parallel EEPROM devices {{typically}} have an 8-bit data bus and an address bus {{wide enough to}} cover the complete memory. Most devices have <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> and write protect pins. Some microcontrollers also have integrated parallel EEPROM.|$|R
25|$|The SD {{protocol}} {{envisioned the}} ability to gang 30 cards together without separate <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> lines. The host device would broadcast commands to all cards and identify the card {{to respond to the}} command using its unique serial number.|$|R
50|$|The SIM (System Integration Module), which {{eliminates}} much {{glue logic}} by providing <b>chip</b> <b>selects</b> and address decoding. The SIM {{also provides a}} clock generator, watchdogs for various system operations, configuration of processor pins, a periodic timer, and an interrupt controller.|$|R
5000|$|LPDDR2 {{also has}} an active-low <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> (when high, {{everything}} is a NOP) and clock enable CKE signal, which operate like SDRAM. Also like SDRAM, the command sent on the cycle that CKE is first dropped selects the power-down state: ...|$|R
2500|$|In addition, {{there are}} three <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> signals (C0, C1, C2), {{allowing}} up to eight stacked chips to be placed inside a single DRAM package. [...] These effectively act as three more bank select bits, bringing the total to seven (128 possible banks).|$|R
50|$|The 80186 {{series was}} {{generally}} intended for embedded systems, as microcontrollers with external memory. Therefore, {{to reduce the}} number of integrated circuits required, it included features such as clock generator, interrupt controller, timers, wait state generator, DMA channels, and external <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> lines.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{memory devices}} {{designed}} {{to connect to}} a bus (such as RAM and ROM chips) have both [...] (<b>chip</b> <b>select)</b> and [...] (output enable) pins, which superficially appear {{to do the same}} thing. If [...] is not asserted, the outputs are high impedance.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} on the {{preprocessing}} of the training data. We find that when a network is trained with <b>selected</b> <b>input,</b> the performance of the network improves significantly as opposed to a network that does not receive <b>selected</b> <b>input</b> data for training. Furthermore, less time is required to train such networks. Problem of image deblurring is used to test the performance of such a network...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Chip</b> <b>select</b> (CS) or slave select (SS) is {{the name}} of a control line in digital {{electronics}} used to select one (or a set) of integrated circuits (commonly called [...] "chips") out of several connected to the same computer bus, usually utilizing the three-state logic.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> {{field of}} 4 bits exists {{to allow the}} {{selection}} of one firmware hub out of many. For example, a second firmware hub {{can be used to}} hold a backup BIOS in case the primary BIOS is corrupted by malware or a bad flash.|$|R
50|$|A memory rank {{is a set}} of DRAM chips {{connected}} to the same <b>chip</b> <b>select,</b> which are therefore accessed simultaneously. In practice they also share all of the other command and control signals, and only the data pins for each DRAM are separate (but the data pins are shared across ranks).|$|R
5000|$|The {{difference}} lies in {{the time}} needed to output the signal. When <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> is deasserted, the chip does not operate internally, {{and there will be a}} significant delay between providing an address and receiving the data. (An advantage of course, is that the chip consumes minimal power in this case.) ...|$|R

The PIA interfaces to the peripheral devices with four interrupt/control lines and two 8-bit bidirectional buses.|$|R
50|$|Aside {{from the}} {{aforementioned}} shift register bug, {{there was a}} potential register corruption problem that usually only occurred in systems using the 6522 with a microprocessor having a non-6502 bus architecture, such as a Motorola 68000. If the address lines changed while <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> was low (inactive) but the Ø2 clock input was high (active), register contents could be changed {{despite the fact that}} the <b>chip</b> was not <b>selected.</b> This was fixed in some but not all of the CMOS versions.|$|R
30|$|Stepwise {{procedure}} was first followed to <b>select</b> significant <b>inputs</b> from an initial set of inputs involving c and t and their interactions {{up to the}} third power.

The whole procedure of model development was done in R mathematical software with ‘step’ and ‘lm’ function.|$|R
