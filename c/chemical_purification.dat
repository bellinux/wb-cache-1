5|$|Both 256Lr and 260Lr have half-lives {{too short}} to allow a {{complete}} <b>chemical</b> <b>purification</b> process. Early experiments with 256Lr therefore used rapid solvent extraction, with the chelating agent thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTA) dissolved in methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) as the organic phase, and with the aqueous phase being buffered acetate solutions. Ions of different charge (+2, +3, or +4) will then extract into the organic phase under different pH ranges, but this method will not separate the trivalent actinides and thus 256Lr must be identified by its emitted 8.24MeV alpha particles.

50|$|Polysilicon is {{produced}} from {{metallurgical grade silicon}} by a <b>chemical</b> <b>purification</b> process, called the Siemens process. This process involves distillation of volatile silicon compounds, and their decomposition into silicon at high temperatures. An emerging, alternative process of refinement uses a fluidized bed reactor. The photovoltaic industry also produces upgraded metallurgical-grade silicon (UMG-Si), using metallurgical instead of <b>chemical</b> <b>purification</b> processes. When produced for the electronics industry, polysilicon contains impurity levels of less than one part per billion (ppb), while polycrystalline solar grade silicon (SoG-Si) is generally less pure. A few companies from China, Germany, Japan, Korea and the United States, such as GCL-Poly, Wacker Chemie, OCI, and Hemlock Semiconductor, {{as well as the}} Norwegian headquartered REC, accounted for most of the worldwide production of about 230,000 tonnes in 2013.|$|E
50|$|In electronics, {{crystalline}} silicon {{is typically}} the monocrystalline form of silicon, {{and is used}} for producing microchips. This silicon contains much lower impurity levels than those required for solar cells. Production of semiconductor grade silicon involves a <b>chemical</b> <b>purification</b> to produce hyperpure polysilicon followed by a recrystallization process to grow monocrystalline silicon. The cylindrical boules are then cut into wafers for further processing.|$|E
50|$|The FBR {{manufacturing}} technology outputs polysilicon at 6N to 9N, a purity still {{higher than the}} 5N to 6N of upgraded metallurgical silicon (UMG-Si), a third technology used by the photovoltaic industry, that dispenses altogether with <b>chemical</b> <b>purification,</b> using metallurgical techniques instead. Currently most silicon for the photovoltaic market is produced by the Siemens process and only about 10 percent by the FBR technology, while UMG-Si accounts for about 2 percent. By 2020, however, IHS Technology predicts that market shares for FBR technology and UMG-Si will grow to 16.7 and 5.4 percent, respectively.|$|E
30|$|For the offshore-based approach, {{seawater}} brine electrolysis {{would be}} a promising choice if it can handle the impurities or if water treatment technologies advance to produce usable water with less cost and increased efficiency.

This could potentially be a solution to produce more hydrogen while increasing the systems functionality by providing water purification and demineralization processes with their necessary mass flows, perhaps also by combining different electrolysis technologies on a platform. The assessments done should be further investigated and ideally simulated. The treatment of sea water and use of treated water should be further assessed and tested in laboratory conditions to quantify the need of <b>chemicals</b> for <b>purification.</b>|$|R

After additional <b>chemical</b> <b>purification</b> steps over several months, Winkler isolated the pure element, germanium, on February 6, 1886 and published his results.

50|$|In 1983 the {{laboratories}} of Peter Quail and Clark Lagarias reported the <b>chemical</b> <b>purification</b> of the intact phytochrome molecule, and in 1985 the first phytochrome gene sequence {{was published by}} Howard Hershey and Peter Quail. By 1989, molecular genetics and work with monoclonal antibodies {{that more than one}} type of phytochrome existed; for example, the pea plant was shown to have at least two phytochrome types (then called type I (found predominantly in dark-grown seedlings) and type II (predominant in green plants)). It is now known by genome sequencing that Arabidopsis has five phytochrome genes (PHYA - E) but that rice has only three (PHYA - C). While this probably represents the condition in several di- and monocotyledonous plants, many plants are polyploid. Hence maize, for example, has six phytochromes - phyA1, phyA2, phyB1, phyB2, phyC1 and phyC2. While all these phytochromes have significantly different protein components, they all use phytochromobilin as their light-absorbing chromophore. Phytochrome A or phyA is rapidly degraded in the Pfr form - much more so than {{the other members of the}} family. In the late 1980s, the Vierstra lab showed that phyA is degraded by the ubiquitin system, the first natural target of the system to be identified in eukaryotes.|$|E
