40|$|P> 1. Clinical and {{experimental}} evidence highlights <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> renin-angiotensin system in renovascular hypertension. Furthermore, genetic factors affecting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) could influence <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> renovascular hypertension. 2. To test <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> small gene perturbations on <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> renovascular hypertension, mice harbouring {{two or three}} <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ace gene were submitted to 4 weeks of two-kidney, one-clip (2 K 1 C) hypertension. Blood pressure (BP), cardiac hypertrophy, baroreflex sensitivity and blood pressure and heart rate variability were assessed and compared between the different groups. 3. The increase in BP induced by 2 K 1 C was higher in mice with three <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ace gene compared with mice with only two copies (46 vs 23 mmHg, respectively). Moreover, there was a 3. 8 -fold increase in <b>the</b> slope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> left ventricle mass/BP relationship in mice with three <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ace gene. Micewith three <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ace gene exhibited greater increases in cardiac and serum ACE activity than mice with only two <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gene. Both baroreflex bradycardia and tachycardia were significantly depressed in mice with three <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ace gene after induction of 2 K 1 C hypertension. The variance in basal systolic BP was greater in mice with three <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ace gene after 2 K 1 C hypertension compared with those with only two <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gene (106 vs 54 %, respectively). In addition, <b>the</b> low-frequency component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pulse interval was higher mice with three <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ace gene after 2 K 1 C hypertension compared with those with only two (168 vs 86 %, respectively). Finally, in mice with three <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ace gene, renovascular hypertension induced a 6. 1 -fold increase in the sympathovagal balance compared with a 3. 2 -fold increase in mice with only two <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gene. 4. Collectively, these data provide direct evidence that small genetic disturbances in ACE levels per se have an influence on haemodynamic, cardiac mass and autonomic nervous system responses in mice under pathological perturbation.
