50|$|As {{a result}} of WBBM-TV's {{purchase}} by CBS, it picked up all CBS programming previously carried by WGN-TV, after a two-month <b>cancellation</b> <b>clause</b> in channel 9's affiliation contract with CBS; this left channel 9 with the quickly crumbling DuMont as its sole network affiliation.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, the {{agreement}} between Alaska and Transcanada was cancelled {{in the light}} of substantially lower prices for natural gas and increased use of extraction technology that has markedly boosted supply, making the pipeline arrangement uneconomic. The 500 million dollars in seed money was forfeited by the State legally to Transcanada under a <b>cancellation</b> <b>clause</b> for front end engineering and design work completed.|$|E
50|$|Cancellation, the {{consequence}} exclusively of a valid contract, cannot be claimed in all circumstances. It {{is an extraordinary}} remedy, available only if the breach is sufficiently serious or material—unless the parties have provided a <b>cancellation</b> <b>clause</b> (a lex commissoria) in the agreement, {{in which case the}} agreement takes precedence over common-law rules. If the breach is minor, and there is no lex commissoria, the innocent party can always rely on specific performance and claim for damages.|$|E
40|$|Luigi Zingales {{points out}} that an {{important}} policy in resolving {{the crisis of the}} 1930 s was the <b>cancellation</b> of gold <b>clauses</b> in industrial bond contracts. Congressional Republicans, however, strongly opposed this policy, and interestingly, today Republicans are again the core opposition to government intervention in credit markets, according to Howard Rosenthal of NYU. ...|$|R
5000|$|In many cases, {{if another}} buyer is not found {{before the end}} of the {{inspection}} period, the wholesaler cancels the original purchase contract (through its <b>cancellation</b> <b>clause)</b> and gets back the deposit. Wholesaling requires little or no money to be secured in escrow, and in most cases the wholesaler never intends to actually purchase the property. The practice of wholesaling is often advertised as [...] "No Money Down and No Risk" [...] by many real estate coaching companies and infomercials since the actual deposit can be as little as $10 and often even the deposit can be returned if the wholesaler cancels the contract {{before the end of}} the inspection period.|$|E
50|$|Channel 9 {{lost its}} CBS {{affiliation}} as a sidebar to the February 1953 merger of ABC and United Paramount Theatres; at the time, CBS had purchased the VHF channel 4 license in Chicago (now WBBM-TV, which later moved to channel 2, forcing Phonevision off the air) from United Paramount Theatres - which absorbed WBKB's founding owners, Balaban and Katz in 1949, after a U.S. Supreme Court order forced Paramount Pictures to divest its chain of movie theaters - for $6.75 million, as the newly merged entity {{could not keep}} both WBKB and ABC owned-and-operated station WENR-TV (channel 7, now WLS-TV) due to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations then enforced that forbade common ownership of two television stations that were licensed to the same market. Following a two-month <b>cancellation</b> <b>clause,</b> all of the CBS programs that WGN-TV had been airing were moved to the rechristened WBBM-TV, leaving channel 9 exclusively with DuMont.|$|E
30|$|Suppose {{that someone}} who is asked if she is hungry replies (7 a), thereby explicating that she has not eaten breakfast that day. In this case, it is {{difficult}} to cancel the explicature {{on the grounds that it}} would be odd to amend the <b>cancellation</b> <b>clause</b> in (7 b). But why is it difficult to cancel the explicature in question? In my opinion, this is due to the fact that (7 a) semantically entails that the speaker has not eaten breakfast on the day of utterance. Accordingly, the attempt to cancel the explicature results in a contradiction.|$|E
40|$|Preleasing of to-be-built {{commercial}} real estate space is a pervasive worldwide practice. Although such preleasing is an extensive and significant activity, it has not received adequate attention {{in the real estate}} economics and finance literature. Using an equilibrium micro-economic agency model, this paper examines the economics of {{commercial real}} estate preleasing. The equilibrium prelease contract rent is a function of several variables, including the expected spot market rent, financing benefits from preleasing, developer-lessor and tenant-lessee risk-hedging behavior, the interplay between lessor and lessee default options, and the market capitalization rate. Our paper demonstrates how the distribution of risk preferences for lessees (and lessors) generates separating market equilibrium for the prelease and spot lease. We also consider the impacts of developer default and the lessee <b>cancellation</b> <b>clause</b> on the prelease rent equilibrium...|$|E
40|$|A {{paradigm}} {{shift in the}} state of life—especially post the Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia 1945 amendments—have not been fully understood properly. Up to now—included in the lawless life—is still a gap between the paradigm and its implementation. This paradigmatic gap visible example of the lack of a comprehensive implementation of the basic principles of the Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia 1945 in a national criminal law reform (draft Code of Criminal Law). The draft Code of Criminal Law as one form of national criminal law reform is seen has not fully represent constitution demands. Prohibiting the use of analogy in criminal law is still seen at odds with the provisions of Article 1 (3) of the Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia 1945. The gap is not only paradigmatic potential to cause difficulties in its application, but also potentially the <b>cancellation</b> <b>clause</b> in the legislation concerned...|$|E
30|$|As we have seen, Capone and Burton-Roberts {{maintain}} {{that we must}} take into account aspects such as the logical structure of discourse and the speaker’s communicative intentions in order to obtain the correct results when applying the cancellability test. However, I argue that placing the (explicit) cancellability test in actual discourse situations is a rather dubious step on the grounds that meanings are not cancelled by the speaker, but by the pragmatician who employs the cancellability test as a diagnostic tool. As said above, both parts of the cancellability test are nothing else but thought experiments; on the one hand, we have to imagine a <b>cancellation</b> <b>clause</b> which cancels the explicature; on the other hand, we have to imagine an utterance context in which the utterance does not give rise to the explicature. To that effect, the objections raised by Capone and Burton-Roberts turn out to be unwarranted. Neither the logical structure of discourse nor the speaker’s intentions matter for issues of cancellability.|$|E
30|$|It is {{important}} to note that the two types of cancellability rely on two types of cancellation which are called explicit and contextual cancellation. In a sense, these two types of cancellation are rather different. While explicit cancellation pertains to a particular utterance context, contextual cancellation refers to a sentence uttered and the meanings that can be communicated with it in different utterance contexts. Accordingly, Jaszczolt maintains that explicit cancellation is an empirically verifiable phenomenon, whereas contextual cancellation is just a kind of thought experiment (see Jaszczolt 2009 : 261). However, in what follows I argue that this view on the two types of cancellation is highly misleading and that both of them should be considered thought experiments: either we have to imagine a <b>cancellation</b> <b>clause</b> which cancels the implicature, or we have to imagine an utterance context in which the utterance does not give rise to the implicature. 2 This view on explicit and contextual cancellation accounts for the fact that both are part of the Gricean cancellability test which is nothing else than one of several diagnostic tools used to distinguish between conventional and conversational implicatures.|$|E
40|$|In Romania, in {{the last}} decade, a {{significant}} number of solutions favorable to consumers with foreign currency denominated loans were obtained in courts against the banks or non-bank financial institutions. The judges noted the unfairness of the contractual terms inserted in the loans agreement and absolute nullity of these clauses. Also, {{in the context of the}} global economic and financial crisis triggered by the collapse of the banking system with the consequence of depreciation and/or sudden and high fluctuation of domestic currencies against the “safe-heaven currencies”, the theory of unpredictability becomes a particularly important institution. This paper deals with the concepts of „abusive clauses”, „unfair commercial practices” and „providing untruthful information to consumers to influence their choices”. It is also presenting a view of good faith and equity on the performance of contract and the “distribution of the risk” of the contract in the conditions of applying to the “unpredictability theory” in the context of terms of law doctrine and the relevant case law. The objective of this study is to demonstrate that by applying the theory of unpredictability to the occurrence of currency risk associated with loans in foreign currency and by subjecting to examination by court to the clauses whereby the consumer must assume the risk given by the changing of the circumstances of the execution of the contract can be obtain by the consumer or a rebalancing of the understanding of the parties or the <b>cancellation</b> <b>clause</b> which significantly unbalanced the consumer's obligation to bear any risk...|$|E
