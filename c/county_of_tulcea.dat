40|$|The {{analysis}} of surveillance data facilitates the planning, implementation {{and evaluation of}} disease control programmes. Geographic information systems (GIS) have several functions, including input (database functions), analysis (interpolation, cluster detection, identification of spatial risk factors) and output (sampling design, disease risk maps). This paper focuses on visualisation techniques that enable improved design and evaluation of surveillance data. Data generated within a pilot GIS-based surveillance programme for avian influenza in village poultry in the Romanian <b>county</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tulcea</b> is used as an example. The use of kriging helped highlight areas {{in the country where}} sampling potentially was sub-optimal, and error maps demonstrated the level of confidence that can be placed in serological surveillance results in different localities. Disease surveillance systems traditionally have not focused on the issues of disease risk and sample size visualisation. Standards need to be developed on how sampling and disease data generated within animal health surveillance systems are analysed and presented. This is particularly important for transboundary diseases such as avian influenza...|$|E
40|$|Following {{work is a}} {{bachelor}} thesis in Geography. It was conducted as the last moment of the Bachelors Program in Geography at the University of Gothenburg, {{during the second half}} of the spring semester, 2013. The aim of the study was to examine and illuminate the interaction of tourism and nature conservation at the Biosphere Reserves of Pietrosul Mare and Danube Delta, Romania. The methods used to achieve this aim have been qualitative interviews with key players of the matter. The results show that the interaction of tourism and nature conservation differs between the areas. At Pietrosul Mare, the interaction is less obvious than in the Danube Delta implying that tourism would look very different without nature conservation there. It was also found that different aspects of tourism affect the reserves differently, mostly depending on the geographical characteristics of each site. Further, the reserves are unequally important to the counties in which they are situated. The Danube Delta is more important to overall tourism in the <b>county</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tulcea</b> than Pietrosul Mare is to overall tourism in the county of Maramures. A development of nature conservation and tourism has taken place in the areas over the last 20 - 25 years. Nature conservation has gone from a low priority to a significant factor, at both sites. Tourism has also evolved, with a slightly increase in visitor numbers at both sites. In Pietrosul Mare, a higher portion of the increase in visitor numbers derives from tourists from neighboring or closely situated countries. At the Danube Delta a higher portion of the increase in visitor numbers are by tourists from long-distance countries. At none of the sites neither the activity of tourism nor nature conservation seems to seriously threaten each other. However, it can also be concluded that they nor yet take, even close to, the maximum possible advantage of each other...|$|E

As this was rejected by Bulgaria, later in the negotiations the Romanians suggested that all Bulgarians residing in Romania be obliged to emigrate and a similar emigration would be mandatory for the Romanians of Southern Dobruja, but not for those residing in other parts of Bulgaria. Partially in order not to derail the negotiations and partially giving in to Germany's pressures, Bulgaria agreed to negotiate an exchange of population. The Bulgarians first suggested that emigration should not be a mandatory requirement. When the Romanians insisted on this issue, the Bulgarians rejected the proposal of the emigration of all Bulgarians residing in Romania versus the emigration of all Romanians residing in Southern Dobruja as not being equivalent. Therefore, the Bulgarians suggested a combination of mandatory and voluntary emigration. The final agreement, reached by the Treaty of Craiova stipulated: ...|$|R
