50|$|Urban renewal {{continued}} to change city demographics during the 1970s, as {{the placement of}} numerous low-income housing projects created a large influx of minority students in the Clinton, Morse and Franklin elementary schools. Although low-income housing projects tended to keep the pupil population size somewhat stable, a definite enrollment decline was apparent {{by the end of}} the decade, with the school population dropping from over 4,800 in 1973 to 3,900 in 1980.The district responded to the declining number of students by reducing class size and spreading out programs. Specialized instructional programs previously offered in the regular classrooms were assigned their own spaces, as separate rooms were set up for art, music and remedial instruction. Major structural renovations were made at the elementary level, with new gymnasiums and cafeterias added to a number of the schools.Teachers’ unions and other employee organizations {{continued to}} grow in strength, demanding salary and benefit increases that required the district to use all available means for taxing above the constitutional limitation. Spiraling energy costs also played havoc with district resources. By the end of the 1970s, the district was again in a period of fiscal crisis, precipitated primarily by the Levittown court case, which closed a loophole in the finance law that allowed small city school districts to tax above their constitutional tax limits to cover the costs of employee benefits. A proposition to raise the constitutional tax limit was again defeated by the voters in 1979, and the district began a campaign to make the state aware of the problems of small city school district financing. To demonstrate that the district was taking all possible measures to trim costs, the two oldest elementary schools, Smith and Franklin, were closed in the spring of 1979. Attendance areas for the remaining schools were redrawn, the pre-kindergarten program was moved from Columbus to Morse and Columbus was opened as a K-5 school. During this same time, the district began plans to apply, for federal funds to create elementary magnet schools. The Morse Early Childhood program was initiated in 1980 as a K-3 school offering full-day kindergarten.The late 1970s and early 1980s saw a return to interest in raising educational standards, providing <b>curriculum</b> <b>continuity,</b> addressing instructional basics and improving test scores. Increasingly rigorous State and Federal legislation regarding services to handicapped students led to the creation of extensive and expensive special education programs. Computer programs were established in recognition of the emerging role of technology, and the Middle School Media Center, which had languished in a state of disrepair during the late 1970s, was again made operational.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Curriculum, {{assessment}} and qualifications reforms in New Zealand have wrought {{significant changes in}} the construction of English as a subject and in the practices of English teachers. While the content of the new English <b>curriculum</b> suggests <b>continuities</b> with past syllabuses, its structural parameters indicate a different discursive agenda. Reforms in senior secondary school qualifications have also acted to construct English in ways that need to be contested and which may be making the subject less responsive to changes in textual practice resulting from the rise in digital technologisation. In a variety of ways, the reforms are also serving to reshape the everyday classroom practices of English teachers, both overtly and covertly through a process of discursive colonisation. Because the reforms have been highly centralised, state initiated and state managed, they have posed a huge challenge to teacher professionalism and identity. Through all of this, the hegemonic status of English as the vehicle through which literature is studied remains unchallenged. The article concludes by listing five challenges to English teachers...|$|R

Hän tutki, miten esi- ja alkuopetuksen pedagogista jatkumoa sekä yhteisöllisyyttä edistettiin yhteisen opetussuunnitelman laatimisvaiheessa. Tutkimustulokset osoittavat, että yhteisen perustan luominen kahden, kulttuuritaustoiltaan erilaisen instituution kasvatus- ja opetustyölle on vuosien keskustelujen työ. - Tutkimustulokset osoittavat, että päiväkoti-kouluyhteisön yhteisestä opetussuunnitelman kehittämisestä näyttää hyötyneen sekä lapset että aikuiset, sillä keskustelua ei käydä enää siitä "mitä päiväkodissa ja koulussa saa opettaa". Sen sijaan keskustellaan siitä, miten lapsen kasvun ja oppimisen polku jatkuisi mahdollisimman joustavana sekä miten esiopetus ja muu varhaiskasvatus sekä perusopetus muodostaisivat kokonaisuuden, jossa huomioidaan lapsen kehityksen jatkumo, Poikonen kertoo. The aim of {{the study}} was to promote the use of a joint <b>curriculum</b> to create <b>continuity</b> through early {{childhood}} education, preprimary education, and primary education. This would ensure a consistent whole as regards a child's development. The theoretical framework {{of the study was}} cognitive-oriented research in organizational culture in which organizational culture is assumed to regenerate and change in interaction between those involved. The context of the study was a newly founded day-care - cum - primary school unit in which the day-care centre and school worked on the same premises. The study was conducted as action research. The first phase was done in 1994 - 1996 and the second in 1999 - 2001. The data collected consisted of individual and group interviews, tape recordings of the meetings of the curriculum workgroup, written documents, the researcher's notes, and a study journal. The first phase in the process of planning the curriculum had features of practical action; discussing the matter together created a common language and lines of action for two institutions with different cultural backgrounds. The second phase had features of practico-emancipatory action, as mutual critical evaluation brought along with it changes in the curriculum, new pedagogic practices were developed, and cultural and professional barriers were crossed. An example of this is the development of age-integrated teaching (a combined classroom), the most significant results of which were the versatility of the pedagogic activities, providing space for a child's individuality to assert itself, new experiences, play and intellectual challenges. Furthermore, joint projects encouraged children of different ages to work together, as well as to act as an assistant teacher. The collaboration between the kindergarten teacher and the primary school teacher also provided a model for the children's working together. The results of the present study add to our understanding of what kind of pedagogic knowledge is needed when developing curricula as a process. The results also add to our understanding of the importance of administrative, cultural, and professional backgrounds when building a continuum from early childhood education to primary educatio...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{article focuses}} {{on the use of}} vignettes as an {{emergent}} dimension of narrative research writing. The author draws on doctoral research that problematised history curriculum and pedagogy with pre-service teachers in the context of secondary teacher education in New Zealand. Pedagogic crossings of history education sites, and negotiation of disciplinary boundaries were storied in the narrative research. A lived experience of <b>curriculum</b> <b>continuity</b> and change had shaped a critical pedagogy orientation in the author’s theorising and practice. This featured a self-reflexivity of pedagogic identities including those of student, practitioner, and researcher. The narrative writing was conceptualised as a layered bricolage of academic socialisation, engagement with theory, and practitioner work. Accordingly, it proved unworkable to distance the author’s lived experience and pedagogic identities from the narrative, for these lay {{at the heart of the}} research. Therefore, the styling of vignettes became a creative way to story self-reflexivity within academic writing. Vignettes were conceived as inside stories that recalled pedagogic voices and evoked themes of curriculum disturbance as transgression, and desire as re-imagined history curriculum...|$|E

The effectiveness of the Geography National Curriculum in achieving its aim to inspire a curiosity and fascination about the world (National Curriculum, 2014) is evaluated. Pupils perceptions for three year groups (Years 7, 9 and 11) were collected using a mixed-methods approach to gather mainly rich qualitative data, alongside further qualitative and quantitative data, principally through posters and questionnaires at two schools. Interviews were also conducted with geography staff. Using a phenomenographic approach to analyse the data, the differences between students’ perceptions of geography were identified. The main findings revealed that students’ perceptions of geography at school {{are focused on the}} everyday study of the world and its relevance to their daily lives. These perceptions originate from a variety of sources, although teachers appear to have the greatest influence. While students do appear to have genuine curiosity and fascination about the topics encompassed in school taught geography, by re-evaluating the balance of the opportunity for productivity and creativity, the relationship between students and geography can be heightened. These findings provide an insight into the potential for improving students’ perceptions to learning geography and the skills necessary to continue academic and personal development.

40|$|This {{research}} {{explored the}} impact that transition, the move students make from Year 6 to Year 7, had upon adolescent students‟ reading and spelling achievement. The research also sought to investigate teachers‟ perceptions of the transition phase. Based on Vygotsky‟s socio-cognitive learning theory and his notion of a student‟s zone of proximal development (ZPD), the study was guided by six research questions. Three questions explored the impact of transition on students‟ literacy achievement {{as determined by the}} Progressive Achievement Test in Reading (PAT-R) and the Single Word Spelling Test (SWST). These included an exploration of the type of transition students undertook (internal transition, staying on the same campus or external transition, changing school campuses) and school socioeconomic status (SES). Three questions were also asked to gather data about the types of programs and practices teachers were using to teach literacy and prepare students for the transition into secondary school. Ten coeducational government schools from the state of Tasmania were chosen for the research. A combination of primary, secondary and district schools from both rural and urban areas were included. Two groups of participants were included in the investigation: students and teachers. Student participants consisted of 244 adolescents, who ranged in age from 11 to 13 years old. A total of 19 teachers from primary, secondary and district schools constituted the second participant group. The research took place over three phases. In phase 1, students completed the PAT-R and SWST whilst in their final year of primary school (Year 6). In phase 2, students completed the PAT-R and the SWST for a second time after they had transitioned to secondary school (Year 7); and in phase 3, teacher participants undertook a series of one-on-one interviews with the researcher. Data were analysed using a mixed methods approach. Students‟ test data were analysed quantitatively using a series of statistical analyses, including ANOVA and MANOVA tests. The analysis revealed that, for the overall cohort, students‟ PAT-R scores significantly declined from Year 6 to Year 7. In comparison, students‟ SWST scores remained steady from Year 6 to Year 7. Students from only one school experienced increases in both their PAT-R and SWST scores across transition. Teacher participant data were analysed qualitatively using a modified approach to thematic analysis, and three common patterns emerged from this analysis. The results revealed that teachers from separate primary and secondary school campuses engaged in less communication than teachers from district schools. Primary and secondary school teachers also perceived a greater lack of <b>curriculum</b> <b>continuity</b> and awareness between Year 6 and Year 7 than district school teachers. All teacher participants stated that an increase in teacher support was needed to enhance the transition experience for students. In conclusion, this study presents three distinctive contributions {{to the understanding of the}} primary to secondary transition. First, attention needs to be paid to the transition phase and the impact this can have upon students‟ literacy achievement. Second, greater communication and increased levels of <b>curriculum</b> <b>continuity</b> and awareness are needed between primary and secondary school campus teachers.

The study approach is based on ethnographic techniques so as to explore children’s learning experiences of technology use at home and school. It combines research perspectives from the fields of early years learning {{and the use of}} technology at home and in the classroom. The study draws on Dewey’s theory of growth and the continuity of experience as an analytical framework, also incorporating literature from early childhood learning theories and research about children’s technology use. The study shows that technology use is a constructive and integrated part of family interactions at home, while at school the teachers use technology mostly for <b>curriculum</b> <b>continuity.</b> The data was based on 62 hours of observations, of two children from one family in the home setting and their respective classrooms. It indicates that both of the teachers focused on the achievement of specific curriculum targets and mostly provided task-oriented activities and interaction. As a result their vision of children’s technology use and learning at school seemed to be fragmented. They missed the totality of children’s learning experiences with technology and the potential to build on their learning through understanding the continuity of their learning experiences. At home the parents appeared to have broader goals and values for their children’s learning. Children along with their parents used technology in relation to other experiences in order to cover broader needs of development and learning. This provided a continuity of experiences in the home setting where the intentions or goals of the experience were either set by the child or shared between the child and other family members. ...|$|E

This qualitative study finds that despite statements in official documentation that <b>curriculum</b> <b>continuity</b> exists because it is built into curriculum design, it in fact {{does not exist in}} sixth class primary and first class post-primary teacher classroom practice. Local curriculum structures influence teacher classroom practise and affect the continuity of students’ educational experience. The existence of a dominant curriculum orientation towards academic rationalism influences the patterns of relationships that exist between and within schools. It is a culture dominated by compliance with historical processes and educational cultural legitimacy between schools, teachers and students. The enquiry was undertaken as a qualitative case study using semi structured interviews with teachers and principals and focus groups with students. While numerous Irish educational reports identify the importance o f transition there are deficiencies in the directions they take to address the problems they have identified. The real issues around transition for students arise out of the failure of primary and post-primary schools to reorganize their structures in how they educate early adolescents. The structural processes of educating students in individual schools are influenced by the culture of the school, its notion of what curriculum is and whether education is understood and approached as a continuum. While primary and post-primary schools, in this study, have little shared sense of educational purpose the teaching of sixth class primary and first class post-primary contain similar instructional methods. This deficit of purpose and similarity of instruction is 2 due to how schools share in national ‘socio-cultural-political processes that shape the content and orientation of curriculum, and legitimize what good teaching practices are, and to what ends’ (Callan 2006, p. 7). Students experience schooling problems rather than transitional problems in such educational environments...|$|E
40|$|Little data {{exists that}} {{specifically}} examines what teachers {{are doing to}} accommodate transient students. There are also only a few studies that use quantitative measures to disentangle the achievement of both the transient and stable populations. This study is significant because it fills these gaps by using data collected through qualitative and quantitative methods to {{examine the impact of}} transiency on one suburban/urban school. ^ This dissertation addresses the question, “What are teachers doing to accommodate transfer students and assist with their inclusion into the classroom to meet their needs?” As a backdrop it also addresses the questions, “When broken down by enrollment year, how do Main Street fifth graders perform on the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment Test?” and “How do stable Main Street fifth graders perform on the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment Test as compared to other stable fifth graders district-wide?” Conducted by a district employee in the participating school district, this study is naturalistic and interpretive. The data included results of a questionnaire/survey, in-depth individual interviews with veteran teachers, student case studies, parent interviews, and finally, multiple documents. ^ The results of this study revealed that teachers are employing a variety of strategies to try to assimilate new transfer students into their classes. Three interconnected themes appeared as significant in accommodating for highly diverse classrooms. Issues of student behavior, weak academic foundations, and the lack of instructional time consistently emerged as problematic for teachers. Other obstacles included class size, lack of resources, gaps in learning, and <b>curriculum</b> <b>continuity.</b> When the results of one standardized test were disentangled {{it was found that the}} stable Main Street population outperformed their transient Main Street peers. The results showed a correlation between mobility and achievement scores; as the number of moves a student made increased, their academic score decreased. Additionally, this study showed that among the stable population district-wide, the lower test scores were found in schools that have a substantial amount of transiency and a lower socioeconomic level, thus correlating with much of the already published literature.

40|$|School {{mobility}} {{is widely}} {{held to be}} disruptive to students' education either directly, by disrupting <b>curriculum</b> <b>continuity</b> or indirectly through social stress and engagement issues affecting the student. Paradoxically, mobility has not been consistently linked to poorer academic outcomes; where mobility was linked with lower academic achievement, behaviour problems and/or inadequate adjustment issues were also found. Adjustment problems implicate student coping strategies. There is {{a gap in the}} mobility literature in relation to coping strategies. This study tests the hypothesis that when particular academic coping strategies are employed by mobile students academic achievement is supported and behavioural problems are avoided. A sample of over one thousand secondary students was employed to gather measures of mobility, academic achievement, suspensions and coping strategies in the pursuit of the following questions: 1. 	Is mobility linked to lower achievement in Australian students? 2. 	Is mobility linked to suspensions in Australian students? 3. 	Are coping strategies employed by mobile students whose academic achievement is satisfactory or better different from those employed by mobile students who are failing? 4. 	Are coping strategies employed by mobile students who are suspended different from those employed by mobile students who are never suspended? Supporting prior findings the mobile students of this study achieved at lower levels and had more suspensions than the non-mobile students. Results indicate that positive coping strategies {{play an important role in}} the achievement profile of mobile students. Adaptive coping was linked to higher academic achievement while the converse was found for non-productive coping strategies in mobile students. Possible explanations for prior inconsistent findings are suggested. Children of mobile middle and high SES families and those whose moves are necessitated by parental employment such as military families, rarely report negative effects. In addition, pre-existing differences have been found to account for achievement differences between mobile and other students in longitudinal studies. Results here suggest that it is not only mobility per se that determines children's outcomes but rather the reasons for moving and the family's attitude to moving. Adolescent's coping repertoires have been found to be largely developed over time in concert with their family's reactions to the range of circumstances they face. They result from socialising influences found within the family. Strategies modelled at home might be the ones the child/adolescent learns to use to manage stress. This could explain why children of some highly mobile families rarely report adverse academic achievement outcomes...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} multiple {{perspectives on the}} education {{of a group of}} fifteen Year 6 and Year 8 students identified as mathematically gifted and talented. The students’ mathematical experiences, both past and present are examined using evidence from school policy documents; student, teacher, and parent interviews; questionnaires; and classroom observations. The purpose of this case study was to seek understandings about awareness of the characteristics of mathematically gifted and talented students, the identification of and educational provisions for mathematically gifted and talented students, parental involvement, and school transfer. The group of fifteen students consisted of ten Year 6 students who transferred from primary school to a new school for Year 7, and five Year 8 students who moved to secondary schools for Year 9. These students had been identified by their school and teachers as gifted and talented in mathematics. This predominantly qualitative study is underpinned by an interpretive paradigm and influenced by a sociocultural philosophy of learning and teaching. The literature review presents the dilemmas, similarities, and differences that prevail in the field of gifted education. A more specific focus is given to the education of mathematically gifted students to highlight gaps in the field. This two-year study tracking a group of students provides a cohesive approach to understanding the educational provisions for students identified as mathematically gifted and talented in the New Zealand setting. The multiple case studies included interviews, questionnaires, documents, and observations. The research findings show {{that there is not a}} comprehensive understanding by schools and teachers about the characteristics of mathematically gifted students. Despite the documentation of a range of identification processes in school policies, a multiple method approach is not practised in many schools. Provision of appropriate programmes is variable and determined by factors such as school organization, identification, teacher knowledge and expertise, and resources. Parents play a key role in their children’s mathematics education as motivators, resource providers, monitors, mathematics content advisers, and mathematical learning advisers. Schools, teachers, parents, and peers all contribute to the success of a student’s transfer from one phase of schooling to another; they support a student’s social and emotional well being and influence <b>curriculum</b> <b>continuity</b> in mathematics. This study provides insights into the various determinants of the development of mathematical talent. For New Zealand schools and teachers, it provides evidence that understanding the characteristics of mathematical giftedness is important and that identification processes must reflect this understanding. Provisions must be well considered and evaluated; the role of parents should be understood and valued; and home-school communications strengthened. Together, all stakeholders share a critical role in the education of mathematically gifted and talented students...|$|E
40|$|This {{field study}} {{is based upon}} {{research}} by a teacher into the initiation, planning and implementation of an Intercultural Studies Project in an A. C. T. Primary School. The innovation {{was funded by the}} A. C. T. Schools Authority under the Curriculum Projects Scheme. The project's evaluation was undertaken from September 1978 until December 1980. The writer was one of the innovators, the co-ordinator of the course and the evaluator. The evaluation occurred mainly through the techniques of direct involvement, observation, questionnaire and interviews. As such this report is an acknowledged insider's view of the innovation and its impact upon the children, the teachers and the school generally. A picture of the perceptions of pupils and teachers towards the process of this particular curriculum innovation has evolved. It is hoped that other teachers may be able to glean information from this case study for specific application to similar types of innovations. This field study report is therefore an evaluation of the process of development and implementation of an Intercultural Studies innovation. Initially, a description of the background and early development of the programme is presented, followed by the rationale upon which the innovation is based. A literature review section studies various general themes and specific concepts. Multiculturalism, intercultural learning and teaching strategies are examined. Also, the characteristics of an innovation are examined {{within the context of the}} project's implementation process. Aspects of the curriculum design involving innovation implementation processes and the gradual development of the curriculum framework are discussed, including a description of a model of evaluation that the study utilises. Finally, the process of the Intercultural Studies Project innovation is examined in some detail. Data presentation with data analysis and interpretation occurs accompanied by general comments from the perspective of the evaluator. Some major elements that have evolved during the process of this curriculum change in an A. C. T. Primary School are as follows: 1. It was easier to change curriculum objectives than to facilitate change in methods of instruction. 2. Both internal and external sources influenced the curriculum process from inception to evaluation stages. 3. Teachers needed extensive inservice training in I. C. S. theory and practice in order to facilitate change of approach, outlook and methods of teaching. 4. I. C. S. partial success as an innovation was due in small degree to the nature of its aims and objectives and most of its intrinsic nature being synonymous with that of the school's Social Science Curriculum. 5. Staff changes affected <b>curriculum</b> <b>continuity</b> and implementation according to original aims. 6. The complexity of the project in the area of new materials and audio visual equipment produced an obstacle to its implementation. 7. Energy dissipation by teachers which was massive in relation to compilation of units of work, meetings, class teaching, and gathering resources was a constraint as teachers have limited time for curriculum development in the primary school context. 8. A plan of change, an implementation framework, resources linkage system, trouble-shooting interventionist approaches to difficulties as these arose and evaluative feedback mechanisms all existed, but much more needed to be done to make all these elements contribute to the innovation's successful implementation...|$|E
40|$|School {{transfer}} {{is one of}} a host of changes in our life. In fact, our whole life from birth to death, is a continuum of transitional stages. From birth to childhood, from home to nursery, from nursery to primary school, from primary school to secondary education, from secondary school to further and higher education. All these, {{in the area of the}} academic life of a person. Moving away from academia into the professional world, we meet another big area of transitions, in which one has to move from one job to another or from one position to a higher one. In the social sphere, one has to move from childhood to adolescence, and then on, into the cycle of family life, where one usually has to play the role of spouse, parent and grandparent. Measor and Woods (1984), point out that the concept of a status passage, originated from Van Gennep's work, The Rites of Passage (1960), and later was developed by Glaser and Strauss (1971). They add that 'It refers to transition in life wherein people undergo a change in status, whether it be from being alive to being dead (Glaser and Strauss's own example, 1968), from being a childless woman to being divorced (Hart 1976), from being a naive recruit to becoming a trained bread salesman (Ditton 1977) (p 159). Most of the above changes are largely considered as a natural course or, at least, a necessary transitional stage in one's life and, therefore, are usually taken for granted. However, school transfer, and especially the transitional period between primary and secondary school, is considered a very crucial stage in schooling. This because the two sectors of education are characterized by marked differences, while at the same time this transitional stage coincides with the passage from childhood to adolescence. Hence, the huge interest in the subject, in the way of research and the abundant literature that has been generated (Nisbet and Entwistle 1966; Nisbet and Entwistle 1969; Sumnera and Bradley 1977; Johnson and Ransom 1983; Measor and Woods (op. cit.); Gorwood 1986; Youngman 1986; Psaltis 1999; Michaelidhou 2000; Psaltis 2000; Psaltis 2001; Pellegrini and Long 2002; Psaltis 2002; Psaltis 2002 b). In the words of Measor and Woods (op. cit), 'For many pupils, it might be thought that the transfer will appear a continuous, natural process, stepping off with eager anticipation from one status with easy assurance on to the next in one movement. But, it is in fact, vastly more complicated' (ibid.). <b>Curriculum</b> <b>continuity</b> is a major factor in the transition (Gorwood op. cit.), but other factors such as intellectual, social organizational and environmental (Measor and Woods op. cit.) play an important role in school transfer from primary to secondary education. Yet, for some, school {{transfer is}} a challenge or a fresh start (Dowling 1986), while for others it is a distressing experience (Youngman 1978), or a trauma (Spelman, 1979). In connection, the Plowden Committee (1967), observed that 'children, like adults, enjoy and are stimulated by novelty and change', but also went on to stress the need for adequate preparation for transition and the importance of avoiding sudden changes if the change were in fact to stimulate and not dishearten, (par. 427). Still, some consider transfer as an event, but others view it as a process. In most schools, the number of people involved in transition is at best restricted to a member of the Senior Management Team (from now on SMT) aided by a few volunteer teachers and at worst, to nobody. Visits to secondary schools by top year primary school pupils is, at best, the most popular function, which is initiated either by the receiving or the feeder schools, as a measure towards easing the school transfer process. At worst, nothing is done. At any rate, I have known of no school that considers school transfer as a whole school activity. My approach is this and with my work, I am hoping to add an alternative dimension to the problem defined as the gap between primary and secondary education, by providing the principles for the development of a comprehensive Induction Programme (Appendix A) ...|$|E
