5|$|Vega {{can often}} be seen near the zenith in the mid-{{northern}} latitudes during the evening in the Northern Hemisphere summer. From mid-southern latitudes, {{it can be seen}} low above the northern horizon during the Southern Hemisphere winter. With a declination of +38.78°, Vega can only be viewed at latitudes north of 51°S. Therefore, it does not rise at all anywhere in Antarctica or in the southernmost part of South America, including Punta Arenas, Chile (53°S). At latitudes to the north of +51°N, Vega remains continually above the horizon as a <b>circumpolar</b> <b>star.</b> Around July 1, Vega reaches midnight culmination when it crosses the meridian at that time.|$|E
5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude of −1.46, Sirius is {{the brightest star}} system in the night sky, almost twice {{the brightness of the}} second brightest star, Canopus. It is not as bright as the Moon, Venus, or Jupiter; at times, Mercury and Mars are also brighter than Sirius. Sirius can be seen from almost everywhere on Earth, with only observers north of 73 degrees latitude unable to see it, and it does not rise very high when viewed from some northern cities, reaching only 13° above the horizon from Saint Petersburg. Sirius, along with Procyon and Betelgeuse, forms one of the three vertices of the Winter Triangle to observers in the Northern Hemisphere. Due to its declination of roughly −17°, Sirius is a <b>circumpolar</b> <b>star</b> from latitudes south of 73° S. From the Southern Hemisphere in early July, Sirius can be seen in both the evening where it sets after the Sun, and in the morning where it rises before the Sun. Due to precession (and slight proper motion), Sirius will move further south in the future. Starting around the year 9000, Sirius will no longer be visible from northern and central Europe, and in 14000 its declination will be −67° and thus it will be circumpolar throughout South Africa and in most parts of Australia.|$|E
25|$|Stars (and constellations) {{that are}} {{circumpolar}} in one hemisphere are always {{invisible in the}} high latitudes of the opposite hemisphere, and these never rise above the horizon. For example, the southern <b>circumpolar</b> <b>star</b> Acrux is invisible {{from most of the}} Contiguous United States, likewise, the seven stars of the northern circumpolar Big Dipper asterism are invisible from most of the Patagonia region of South America.|$|E

25|$|A <b>circumpolar</b> <b>star</b> is a star, as {{viewed from}} a given {{latitude}} on Earth, that never sets {{below the horizon}} due to its apparent proximity {{to one of the}} celestial poles.

In the mid-1st century AD Lucan writes of Pompey who {{questions}} a sailor {{about the use of}} stars in navigation. The sailor replies with his description of the use of circumpolar stars to navigate by. To navigate along a degree of latitude a sailor would have needed to find a <b>circumpolar</b> <b>star</b> above that degree in the sky.

2500|$|Seen {{from the}} equator the {{celestial}} North Pole (boreios polos) {{is a point}} on the horizon. As the observer moves northward the pole rises and the <b>circumpolar</b> <b>stars</b> appear, now unblocked by the Earth. At the Tropic of Cancer the radius of the <b>circumpolar</b> <b>stars</b> reaches 24°. The edge stands on the horizon. The constellation of mikra arktos (Ursa Minor, [...] "little bear") was entirely contained within the circumpolar region. The latitude was therefore called the arktikos kuklos, [...] "circle of the bear". The terrestrial Arctic Circle was regarded as fixed at this latitude. The celestial Arctic Circle was regarded as identical to the circumference of the <b>circumpolar</b> <b>stars</b> and therefore a variable.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>circumpolar</b> <b>stars</b> {{appear to}} lie within a circle that is {{centered}} at the celestial pole and tangential to the horizon. At the Earth's North Pole, the {{north celestial pole}} is directly overhead, and all stars that are visible at all (that is, all stars in the Northern Celestial Hemisphere) are circumpolar. As one travels south, the north celestial pole moves towards the northern horizon. More and more stars that are {{at a distance from}} it begin to disappear below the horizon for some portion of their daily [...] "orbit", and the circle containing the remaining <b>circumpolar</b> <b>stars</b> becomes increasingly small. At the Equator, this circle vanishes to a single point – the celestial pole itself – which lies on the horizon, and there are thus effectively no <b>circumpolar</b> <b>stars</b> at all.|$|R

5000|$|Two of {{the stars}} in the Big Dipper line up very closely with and point to Polaris.

James Kelley has argued against the historicity of this interpretation in the Journal of Popular Culture.|$|E
50|$|Alpha Apodis (Alpha Aps, α Apodis, α Aps) is the {{brightest}} star in the southern circumpolar constellation of Apus, with an apparent magnitude of approximately 3.825.

With a declination of -79°, this is a <b>circumpolar</b> <b>star</b> for much of the southern hemisphere.

50|$|The line {{of sight}} of the {{telescope}} needed to be exactly within the plane of the meridian. This was done approximately by building the piers and the bearings of the axis on an east-west line. The telescope was then brought into the meridian by repeatedly timing the (apparent, incorrect) upper and lower meridian transits of a <b>circumpolar</b> <b>star</b> and adjusting one of the bearings horizontally until the interval between the transits was equal. Another method used calculated meridian crossing times for particular stars as established by other observatories. This was an important adjustment, and much effort was spent in perfecting it.|$|E

50|$|Some stars, {{when viewed}} from a {{particular}} latitude on Earth, do not rise or set. These are <b>circumpolar</b> <b>stars,</b> which are either always in the sky or never.

50|$|Groombridge Transit Circle was a {{meridian}} transit circle made by Edward Troughton for Stephen Groombridge in 1806, which Groombridge used {{to compile}} {{data for the}} star catalogue, Catalogue of <b>Circumpolar</b> <b>Stars.</b> The advantage of a transit circle over a mural circle (which can measure polar distances) {{is that it allows}} measuring right ascension and declination at the same time.|$|R
25|$|The north {{celestial}} pole is located {{very close to the}} pole star (Polaris or North Star), so from the Northern Hemisphere, all <b>circumpolar</b> <b>stars</b> appear to move around Polaris.
