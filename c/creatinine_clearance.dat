5|$|Linezolid is metabolized in the liver, by {{oxidation}} of the morpholine ring, without {{involvement of}} the cytochrome P450 system. This metabolic pathway leads to two major inactive metabolites (which each account for around 45% and 10% of an excreted dose at steady state), one minor metabolite, and several trace metabolites, none of which {{accounts for more than}} 1% of an excreted dose. Clearance of linezolid varies with age and gender; it is fastest in children (which accounts for the shorter half-life), and appears to be 20% lower in women than in men. There is a strong correlation between linezolid clearance and <b>creatinine</b> <b>clearance</b> (CLCR).|$|E

40|$|Renal {{impairment}} {{is common}} amongst elderly patients {{and increases the}} risk of drug toxicity. Analysis of the discharge summaries of patients discharged from the geratology wards of an Oxfordshire hospital, showed that renal impairment was not referred to in 42 % of patients with calculated <b>creatinine</b> <b>clearances</b> of 10 - 20 ml/min. A fifth of these patients, and 67 % of patients with calculated <b>creatinine</b> <b>clearances</b> < 10 ml/min, had discharge drug prescriptions that contradicted the British National Formulary guidelines for prescribing in the presence of renal impairment. There should be increased awareness that, in elderly patients, normal serum creatinine concentrations do not exclude renal impairment and that several commonly prescribed drugs require dose adjustments or should be avoided in the presence of renal insufficiency...|$|R

40|$|TO THE EDITOR: I read Radecki’s article (1) with {{interest}} and {{agree with his}} concerns. Some of the potential harms stem from dabiga-tran’s use for unapproved indications and in populations {{that have not been}} well-studied. The approval of dabigatran in the United States was based mostly on the results of the RE-LY (Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy) trial involving more than 18 000 patients (2). Unfortunately, this trial did not include patients with <b>creatinine</b> <b>clearances</b> less than 30 mL/min per 1. 73 m 2, which is common in the elderly and in patients with stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease. The U. S. Food and Drug Administration approved dabigatran at a dosage of 150 mg orally twice daily in patients with <b>creatinine</b> <b>clearances</b> of 15 to 30 mL/min per 1. 73 m 2.

More specialized tests can be ordered to discover or link certain systemic diseases to kidney failure such as infections (hepatitis B, hepatitis C), autoimmune conditions (systemic lupus erythematosus, ANCA vasculitis), paraproteinemias (amyloidosis, multiple myeloma) and metabolic diseases (diabetes, cystinosis).|$|E
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of aminoglycoside elimination {{were determined}} in 18 hospitalized narcotics abusers receiving gentamicin or tobramycin {{for treatment of}} severe infection. Rapid aminoglycoside elimination (requiring doses of greater than 5 mg/kg per day to maintain adequate drug levels) was noted in 12 of the 18 patients (18 of 27 clearance studies). Patients found to have rapid elimination were younger (P less than 0. 01) and had larger drug distribution volumes (P less than 0. 005), greater measured <b>creatinine</b> <b>clearances</b> (P less than 0. 05), and lower creatinine levels in serum (P less than 0. 001) than those with normal elimination. Nevertheless, by regression analysis, age, creatinine levels in serum, <b>creatinine</b> <b>clearances,</b> and drug distribution volumes proved to be unreliable predictors of individual aminoglycoside clearance. Measured drug half-life in serum {{appeared to be the}} only reliable predictor of drug clearance (r = 0. 93). Patients with rapid drug elimination had aminoglycoside clearances 16 to 43 % greater than measured <b>creatinine</b> <b>clearances,</b> suggesting an extraglomerular route of drug elimination. We conclude that in drug abuse patients a significant and clinically unpredictable interpatient variation occurs in aminoglycoside elimination and that accurate serum kinetics are needed to determine therapeutic dosing. In addicts younger than 35 years, with a creatinine level of less than 1. 0 mg/ 100 ml in serum, the risk of inadequate therapy is high if standard dosing guidelines are followed. For this group, initial dosing of 8 mg/kg per day, with a drug half-life determination on the first dose, is recommended. Pharmacokinetic analysis is critical for all drug abusers treated with aminoglycosides for serious infection...|$|R

40|$|A{{symmetric}} NG,NG-dimethylarginine (ADMA) and symmetric NG,N'G-dimethylarginine (SDMA) {{are basic}} endogenous amino acids with a guanidino group. Our renal distribution study of dimethylarginines clearly indicates that, in mouse and rat, ADMA and SDMA levels are most abundant as protein-incorporated compounds (95 %). ADMA represents almost 90 % of this protein-incorporated dimethylarginine amount. The four zones studied (cortex, outer and inner stripe of outer medulla, inner medulla) contain {{more or less}} the same amount of protein-incorporated dimethylarginine; the concentrations of both free dimethylarginines vary more in the different zones. Plasma and urinary excretion levels in Man, rat and mouse were determined, their changes in renal insufficiency were examined and compared between species. Highly significant negative correlations between both plasma dimethylarginine levels and <b>creatinine</b> <b>clearances</b> were found in Man and rat. The correlation between urinary ADMA excretion levels and <b>creatinine</b> <b>clearances</b> was highly significant and positive in Man and mouse; however, in rat the correlation was negative. In patients with severe renal insufficiency, ADMA clearance was only 9. 5 % of controls, and that of SDMA only 7. 8 %.

Twenty-five patients had acute pyelonephritis; 7 of the 25 had bacteremia. The infecting bacteria were Escherichia coli (15), Proteus mirabilis (5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Enterobacter hafniae (1), and both Proteus rettgeri and Proteus morganii (1).

50|$|In {{clinical}} practice, however, <b>creatinine</b> <b>clearance</b> or {{estimates of}} <b>creatinine</b> <b>clearance</b> {{based on the}} serum creatinine level are used to measure GFR. Creatinine is produced naturally by the body (creatinine is a breakdown product of creatine phosphate, which is found in muscle). It is freely filtered by the glomerulus, but also actively secreted by the peritubular capillaries in very small amounts such that <b>creatinine</b> <b>clearance</b> overestimates actual GFR by 10% to 20%. This margin of error is acceptable, considering {{the ease with which}} <b>creatinine</b> <b>clearance</b> is measured. Unlike precise GFR measurements involving constant infusions of inulin, creatinine is already at a steady-state concentration in the blood, and so measuring <b>creatinine</b> <b>clearance</b> is much less cumbersome. However, creatinine estimates of GFR have their limitations. All of the estimating equations depend on a prediction of the 24-hour creatinine excretion rate, which is a function of muscle mass which is quite variable. One of the equations, the Cockcroft and Gault equation (see below) does not correct for race. With a higher muscle mass, serum creatinine will be higher for any given rate of clearance.|$|E
40|$|Is peritoneal {{dialysis}} adequate for hypercatabolic {{acute renal failure}} in developing countries?BackgroundPeritoneal dialysis (PD) is a therapeutic option for acute renal failure (ARF) in developing countries, despite concerns about inadequacy. Shorter and more efficient tidal {{peritoneal dialysis}} (TPD) was compared with continuous equilibrating peritoneal dialysis (CEPD) therapy in ARF by using their adequacies as accepted standards and analyzing the solute reduction indices (SRI). MethodsA prospective, randomized crossover trial was performed in patients with mild to moderate hypercatabolic ARF who were assigned to CEPD and TPD therapy after an adequate washout period. Solute <b>clearances</b> (Kt/V, normalized <b>creatinine</b> <b>clearances)</b> were compared to NKF guidelines. Potassium and phosphate clearances, dextrose absorption, protein losses and costs were compared. Kt/V was compared to SRIdialysate, SRIKt/V. ResultsEighty-seven patients with ARF received 236 sessions of dialysis (118 in each treatment). TPD resulted in higher clearances of solutes than CEPD (<b>creatinine</b> and urea <b>clearances</b> in mL/min of 9. 94 ± 2. 93, 6. 74 ± 1. 63 and 19. 85 ± 1. 95, 10. 63 ± 2. 62, respectively, P = 0. 001). TPD and CEPD normalized <b>creatinine</b> <b>clearances</b> (L/week/ 1. 73 m 2 BSA) and Kt/V values were 68. 5 ± 4. 43, 58. 85 ± 2. 57 and 2. 43 ± 0. 87, 1. 80 ± 0. 32, respectively. CEPD did not meet standards of adequacy. TPD resulted in greater potassium and phosphate clearances, less dextrose absorption and was less expensive. CEPD resulted in less protein loss. Kt/V corresponded to SRIdialysate 0. 88 ± 0. 12 (P = 0. 076). ConclusionTPD produced higher solute clearances in less time with greater protein loss.

Urine was collected over a 4 -h dosing interval at steady state (after at least 5 doses of the drug).

While a large degree of variability in absorption was observed in this study, significant amounts of aminoglycosides could be absorbed in some patients.
