5|$|Around 120,000 {{species of}} fungi have been {{described}} by taxonomists, but the global biodiversity of the fungus kingdom is not fully understood. A 2017 estimate suggests there may be between 2.2 and 3.8 million species. In mycology, species have historically been distinguished {{by a variety of}} methods and concepts. Classification based on morphological <b>characteristics,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> {{the size and shape of}} spores or fruiting structures, has traditionally dominated fungal taxonomy. Species may also be distinguished by their biochemical and physiological <b>characteristics,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> their ability to metabolize certain biochemicals, or their reaction to chemical tests. The biological species concept discriminates species based on their ability to mate. The application of molecular tools, such as DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, to study diversity has greatly enhanced the resolution and added robustness to estimates of genetic diversity within various taxonomic groups.|$|E

5|$|In addition, {{diversity}} of a harvested plant {{can be the}} result of genetic differences: a crop may have genes conferring early maturity or disease resistance Such traits collectively determine a crop's overall characteristics and their future potential. Diversity within a crop includes genetically-influenced attributes such as seed size, branching pattern, height, flower color, fruiting time, and flavor.

5|$|Avialans diversified into a {{wide variety}} of forms during the Cretaceous Period.

In the late Cretaceous, around 95 million years ago, the ancestor of all modern birds also evolved a better sense of smell.|$|E
5|$|Cabbage (Brassica oleracea or B.oleracea var. capitata, var. tuba, var. sabauda or var. acephala) is {{a member}} of the genus Brassica and the mustard family, Brassicaceae. Several other cruciferous {{vegetables}} (sometimes known as cole crops) are considered cultivars of B.oleracea, including broccoli, collard greens, brussels sprouts, kohlrabi and sprouting broccoli. All of these developed from the wild cabbage B.oleracea var. oleracea, also called colewort or field cabbage. This original species evolved over thousands of years into those seen today, as selection resulted in cultivars having different <b>characteristics,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> large heads for cabbage, large leaves for kale and thick stems with flower buds for broccoli.|$|E
5|$|German ornithologist Erwin Stresemann lumped all Australian corvids plus {{other species}} {{as far as}} India into a single species, C. coronoides, as he {{believed}} there was intergradation between all <b>characteristics</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> iris colour, colour of feather bases and plumage. This was hotly disputed by Mathews. The official RAOU checklist listed three species (Australian raven, Torresian crow and little crow), with the little raven recognised as a fourth species in 1967 and forest raven in 1970. Streseman described C. difficilis in 1943 from a single specimen, now {{thought to have been}} an unusual Australian raven or an Australian raven/Torresian crow hybrid.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that ASL is a creole with LSF as the superstrate language and with the native village sign languages as substrate languages. However, more recent {{research has shown that}} modern ASL does not share many of the structural features that characterize creole languages. ASL may have begun as a creole and then undergone structural change over time, but {{it is also possible that}} it was never a creole-type language. There are modality-specific reasons that sign languages tend towards agglutination, for example the ability to simultaneously convey information via the face, head, torso, and other body parts. This might override creole <b>characteristics</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the tendency towards isolating morphology. Additionally, Clerc and Gallaudet may have used an artificially constructed form of manually coded language in instruction rather than true LSF.|$|E
5|$|Sarcoscypha dudleyi, {{commonly}} known as the crimson cup or the scarlet cup, is a species of fungus in the Sarcoscyphaceae family of the Pezizales order. In addition to its main distribution in the central to eastern United States, the fungus has also been recorded once in Bulgaria. It has been frequently confused with Sarcoscypha coccinea, but can be distinguished from this and other related species in Sarcoscypha by differences in microscopic <b>characteristics,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the presence and number of oil droplets in the spores. The species Molliardiomyces dudleyi is an imperfect form of the fungus that lacks a sexually reproductive stage in its life cycle.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{were among}} the first animals to be domesticated by {{humankind}} (although the domestication of dogs may be over 20,000 years earlier); the domestication date is estimated to fall between 11,000 and 9,000 B.C in Mesopotamia. Their wild relatives have several <b>characteristics,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> a relative lack of aggression, a manageable size, early sexual maturity, a social nature, and high reproduction rates, which made them particularly suitable for domestication. Today, Ovis aries is an entirely domesticated animal that is largely dependent on humans for its health and survival. Feral sheep do exist, but exclusively in areas devoid of large predators (usually islands) and not on the scale of feral horses, goats, pigs, or dogs, although some feral populations have remained isolated long enough to be recognized as distinct breeds.|$|E
