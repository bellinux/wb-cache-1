5|$|Friskies is {{produced}} and marketed by Nestlé Purina Petcare, {{a subsidiary of}} Nestlé. Friskies was first introduced in the 1930s by <b>Carnation</b> through its subsidiary, Albers Company. By 1973, Friskies was one of five companies that controlled two-thirds of the $1.75 billion pet food market. At the time <b>Carnation</b> was known for dry milk products, but also had operations processing animal feed for farms. It experimented with dry food products for 3.5 years at <b>Carnation</b> Farms, initially with stray dogs in improvised cages, and later with pure-breds in a formal kennel. <b>Carnation</b> International was formed in 1966 to market Carnation's pet food products internationally in Japan, Spain, France, England and Italy, among others.|$|E

5|$|Back in the West End, Richardson was {{in another}} Sherriff play, The White <b>Carnation,</b> in 1953, and in November {{of the same year}} he and Gielgud starred {{together}} in NCHunter's A Day by the Sea, which ran at the Haymarket for 386 performances. During this period, Richardson played Dr Watson in an American/BBC radio co-production of Sherlock Holmes stories, with Gielgud as Holmes and Orson Welles as the evil Professor Moriarty. These recordings were later released commercially on disc.|$|E

50|$|A {{marketing}} and grading system for <b>carnations</b> {{was established in}} the early 1900s. Swedish immigrant and founder of the Denver Wholesale Florist s, N.A. Benson, recognized that Colorado <b>carnations</b> were a valuable commodity that could be marketed nationally. He was instrumental in standardizing prices and insisting on quality from all growers. Around that time, J. Edward Johnson, of the Pikes Peak Floral Company in Colorado Springs began shipping the prized Colorado <b>carnations</b> to neighboring states.|$|R
5|$|In {{a prelude}} to the <b>Carnation</b> Revolution, {{in the early morning}} of 16 March 1974, the Fifth Infantry Regiment (Regimento de Infantaria 5), based in Caldas da Rainha in what is now the School of Army Sergeants (Escola de Sargentos do Exército), {{attempted}} to stage a coup d'état against the country's authoritarian Estado Novo regime. Thirty officers and about 300 sergeants and enlisted men from the regiment left their quarters at 4:00a.m., heading for Lisbon, where they planned to occupy the airport. On approaching the capital, the Caldas regiment found themselves alone, realizing that the other units supposed to participate in the coup had not joined the upheaval. The regiment turned back and reached their Caldas quarters at around 10:00a.m., locking themselves in and awaiting a siege. The compound was surrounded by various forces, which penetrated the base at about 5:00p.m. The revolters were arrested and sent to various military prisons, where they were held until the <b>Carnation</b> Revolution on 25 April 1974, 40 days later.|$|E
5|$|A {{prevalent}} {{tradition in}} Florence was the small altarpiece of the Virgin and Child. Many {{of these were}} created in tempera or glazed terracotta by the workshops of Filippo Lippi, Verrocchio and the prolific della Robbia family. Leonardo's early Madonnas such as The Madonna with a <b>carnation</b> and the Benois Madonna followed this tradition while showing idiosyncratic departures, {{particularly in the case}} of the Benois Madonna in which the Virgin is set at an oblique angle to the picture space with the Christ Child at the opposite angle. This compositional theme was to emerge in Leonardo's later paintings such as The Virgin and Child with St. Anne.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a report}} by the Diário de Notícias, Portugal had allowed {{considerable}} slippage in state-managed public works and inflated top management and head officer bonuses and wages in the period between the <b>Carnation</b> Revolution in 1974 and 2010. Persistent and lasting recruitment policies boosted the number of redundant public servants. Risky credit, public debt creation, and European structural and cohesion funds were mismanaged across almost four decades. When the global crisis disrupted the markets and the world economy, together with the US subprime mortgage crisis and the eurozone crisis, Portugal {{was one of the first}} economies to succumb, and was affected very deeply.|$|E

50|$|Few {{varieties}} of <b>carnations</b> were available during {{those early days}} and competition was fierce. Many independent growers marketed their <b>carnations</b> through sales outlets in their greenhouses or by selling the mature flowers to retail florists. Growers {{had to contend with}} weather extremes that required either charcoal heaters in delivery wagons during winter so the flowers wouldn’t freeze or battling the often-intense summer heat when the crops could easily wilt. Nonetheless, business flourished. Floral arrangements featuring <b>carnations</b> were a common gift to the women of Denver's tenderloin district as well as high society.|$|R
5|$|Costa Gomes {{argued that}} African {{soldiers}} were cheaper and were {{better able to}} create a relationship with the local populace, a tactic similar to the 'hearts and minds' strategy being used by United States forces in Vietnam at the time. These Flechas units saw action in the territory at the very end stages of the conflict, following the dismissal of Kaúlza de Arriaga {{on the eve of the}} Portuguese coup in 1974 – the <b>Carnation</b> Revolution. The units were to continue to cause problems for the FRELIMO even after the Revolution and Portuguese withdrawal, when the country splintered into civil war.|$|E
5|$|Friskies is a {{brand of}} wet and dry cat food and treats. It is owned by Nestlé Purina PetCare Company, a {{subsidiary}} of Nestlé. Friskies was initially introduced by <b>Carnation</b> Company in the 1930s as a dog food brand. When Friskies cat food {{was introduced in the}} 1950s, it was the first dry pet food product specifically for cats. The brand was acquired by Nestlé in 1985. From the 1970s to the 2000s, variations in Friskies cat food proliferated as the competition for consumer spending intensified.|$|E

5|$|The growing {{unrest in}} Portugal culminated on April 25, 1974, when the <b>Carnation</b> Revolution, a {{peaceful}} leftist military coup d'état in Lisbon, ousted the incumbent Portuguese government of Marcelo Caetano. Thousands of Portuguese citizens left Mozambique, {{and the new}} head of government, General António de Spínola, called for a ceasefire. With the change of government in Lisbon, many soldiers refused to continue fighting, often remaining in their barracks instead of going on patrol. Negotiations between the Portuguese administration culminated in the Lusaka Accord signed on September 7, 1974, which provided for a complete hand-over of power to FRELIMO, uncontested by elections. Formal independence was set for June 25, 1975, the 13th anniversary of the founding of FRELIMO.|$|E
5|$|Back in Lisbon, the 'Armed Revolutionary Action' {{branch of}} the Portuguese Communist Party, which {{was created in the}} late 1960s, and the Revolutionary Brigades (BR), a left-wing organisation, worked to resist the colonial wars. They had carried out {{multiple}} sabotages and bombings against military targets, such as the attack on the Tancos air base that destroyed several helicopters on March 8, 1971, and the attack on the NATO headquarters at Oeiras in October of the same year. The attack on the Portuguese ship Niassa illustrated the role of the colonial wars in this unrest. Niassa (named after a Mozambican province) was preparing to leave Lisbon with troops to be deployed in Guinea. By the time of the <b>Carnation</b> Revolution, 100,000 draft dodgers had been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1974 <b>Carnation</b> Revolution, Portugal began {{a process}} of decolonisation and began a {{withdrawal}} from Portuguese Timor (later East Timor). Australians had long taken {{an interest in the}} colony; the nation had sent troops to the region during World War II, and many East Timorese had fought the Japanese as guerrillas. In September 1974, Whitlam met with President Suharto in Indonesia and indicated that he would support Indonesia if it annexed East Timor. At the height of the Cold War, and {{in the context of the}} American retreat from Indo-China, he felt that incorporation of East Timor into Indonesia would enhance the stability of the region, and reduce the risk of the East Timorese FRETILIN movement, which many feared was communist, coming to power.|$|E

5|$|From a {{military}} standpoint, the Portuguese regular army held {{the upper hand}} during the conflict against the independentist guerrilla forces. Nonetheless, Mozambique succeeded in achieving independence on June 25, 1975, after a civil resistance movement known as the <b>Carnation</b> Revolution backed by portions {{of the military in}} Portugal overthrow the military dictatorship sponsored by US, thus ending 470 years of Portuguese colonial rule in the East African region. According to historians of the Revolution, the military coup in Portugal was in part fuelled by protests concerning the conduct of Portuguese troops in their treatment of some local Mozambican populace. The role of the growing communist influence over the group of Portuguese military insurgents who led the Lisbon's military coup, and, on the other hand, the pressure of the international community over the direction of the Portuguese Colonial War in general, were main causes for the final outcome.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>Carnation</b> Revolution in Lisbon {{and the end}} of the Angolan War of Independence, {{the parties}} of the {{conflict}} signed the Alvor Accords on 15 January 1975. In July 1975, the MPLA violently forced the FNLA out of Luanda, and UNITA voluntarily withdrew to its stronghold in the south. By August, the MPLA had control of 11 of the 15 provincial capitals, including Cabinda and Luanda. South Africa intervened on 23 October, sending between 1,500 and 2,000 troops from Namibia into southern Angola in order to support the FNLA and UNITA. Zaire, in a bid to install a pro-Kinshasa government and thwart the MPLA's drive for power, deployed armored cars, paratroopers, and three infantry battalions to Angola in support of the FNLA. Within three weeks, South African and UNITA forces had captured five provincial capitals, including Novo Redondo and Benguela. In response to the South African intervention, Cuba sent 18,000 soldiers as part of a large-scale military intervention nicknamed Operation Carlota in support of the MPLA. Cuba had initially provided the MPLA with 230 military advisers prior to the South African intervention. The Cuban intervention proved decisive in repelling the South African-UNITA advance. The FNLA were likewise routed at the Battle of Quifangondo and forced to retreat towards Zaire. The defeat of the FNLA allowed the MPLA to consolidate power over the capital Luanda.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} day of the invasion, the two main forces made rapid {{progress}} inland, the militia troops sent against them retreating and deserting without offering resistance. Serious opposition to the British advance did not begin until 1 February, when French defenders on the heights of Desfourneaux and Surirey were attacked by Prevost's troops, under the direct command of Brigadier-General Daniel Hoghton. Fighting was fierce throughout the next two days, as the outnumbered French used the fortified high ground to hold back a series of frontal assaults. The British lost 84 killed and 334 wounded to French losses of over 700 casualties, and by 3 February the French had been forced back, withdrawing to Fort Desaix near the capital. Progress was also made at Cape Salomon, where the appearance of British troops panicked the French defenders into burning the naval brig <b>Carnation</b> and retreating to the small island, Ilot aux Ramiers, offshore. Henderson's men, assisted by a naval brigade under Captain George Cockburn, set up batteries on the coast and by 4 February had bombarded the island into surrender, opening the principal harbour of Martinique to naval attack.|$|E
