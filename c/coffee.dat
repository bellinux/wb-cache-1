5|$|In the United States, Rick had a {{temporary}} economic impact when, during its time off {{the shore of}} Chiapas and Oaxaca, it caused the price of <b>coffee</b> to rise 4.7 percent to $1.5685 per pound on the <b>Coffee,</b> Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, the highest total it reached since October 16. Mexico is the United States's largest source of <b>coffee</b> imports and Oaxaca and Chiapas are the largest <b>coffee</b> growing regions in Mexico. Like the impact in El Tomatal, Rick's effects were much worse than Pauline's because Rick threatened the <b>coffee</b> crop when the beans were more susceptible to winds that could blow them off.|$|E

Sara Lee claims the advantage of the system is that each cup of <b>coffee</b> is made at the time of order with minimal waste and labor. The product was not designed to compete with products from companies such as Starbucks, but was intended to appeal to customers who seek a consistent cup of <b>coffee.</b>|$|E

Rwandan president Paul Kagame was also present, as the government placed great importance on the project. Community purchased an 18,000kilogram (40,000lb) container of Maraba beans at the above-average rate of US$3 per kilogram. The beans were transported to Louisiana, where they were roasted and blended into one of the company's gourmet coffees.

40|$|Direct {{infusion}} electrospray ionization {{mass spectrometry}} {{in both the}} negative ESI(-) -MS and positive ESI(+) -MS ion modes are investigated to differentiate green and roasted Arabica <b>coffees</b> with different stages of ripeness (green, ripe and overripe), post-harvesting process (dry, wet and semi-wet) and <b>coffees</b> with different cup qualities. In the ESI(-) -MS of green <b>coffees,</b> ions from deprotonated fatty acids and chlorogenic acids {{are the most important}} for ripeness discrimination. In the ESI(+) -MS, maturity is differentiated by ions from protonated caffeine, chlorogenic acids and K+ adducts of fatty acids. To differentiate between post-harvesting process in both ionization modes, ions from fatty acids, chlorogenic acids, sugars and carboxylic acids generated in the fermentation process are the most representative. Roasted Arabica <b>coffees</b> are also well discriminated: in the ESI(-) -MS, ions from chlorogenic acids and short-chain organic acids derived from sugars are important. In the ESI(+) -MS, discrimination are mainly performed by low m/z ions such as protonated pyridine and alkylpiridines formed via trigonelline degradation. Both ESI(+) -MS and ESI(-) -MS are able to differentiate cup quality for Arabica roasted <b>coffees</b> and the ions used to perform discrimination are the same ones described in ripeness and post-harvesting processes...|$|R

5|$|The <b>coffee</b> {{farmers of}} Maraba first needed a washing station to remove sugar from the coating of the <b>coffee</b> bean, under the skin. If this sugar is not removed within 12 hours of picking, the flavour of the <b>coffee</b> is impaired. They {{built the first}} station in July 2001 in the Cyarumbo sector, close to the main road, with funding from UNR, the Office des Cultures Industrielles du Rwanda (OCIR-Café), ACDI/VOCA, and the Institut des Sciences Agronomiques du Rwanda (ISAR). The opening {{was late in the}} harvest season, so only 200kilograms (441lb) of that year's harvest were {{suitable}} for washing. However, the results were reasonably good, and the station was upgraded to allow more <b>coffee</b> to be processed in 2002. To bring mineral water from Mount Huye to the upgraded station, ACDI/VOCA helped fund a pipeline, which opened in March 2002.|$|E

40|$|Methylxanthines present {{psychostimulant}} effects. These compounds {{have low}} toxicity and their consumption at moderate levels presents some beneficial health effects, whereas some significant risk appears at high levels. Samples of common types of methylxanthine-containing beverages and foods consumed in Spain were analyzed {{to determine their}} content. Caffeine was the methylxanthine that was most found in the samples investigated. Instant <b>coffees</b> gave the highest caffeine percentage (18 – 44 mg·g− 1). Green and scented teas {{were found to have}} a caffeine dry-weight content (8 – 26 mg·g− 1) equivalent to ground <b>coffees</b> (13 – 23 mg·g− 1), but black and pu-erh teas (18 – 30 mg·g− 1) had a higher caffeine content. The evaluation of the most conventional methods for preparing espresso <b>coffees</b> showed that an espresso contains between 88 – 116 mg of caffeine. In the case of tea beverages, the amount of caffeine present was 2 – 3 times smaller than in espresso <b>coffees.</b> Energy drinks showed a similar caffeine content (80 – 106 mg) as espresso <b>coffees.</b> Chocolates had the lowest caffeine content. It has been found that none of the foods evaluated reach the recommended daily intake limit of 400 mg of caffeine with a single dose. This limit can be reached with 4 – 5 doses in the case of <b>coffees</b> and energy drinks. In the case of chocolates, the methylxanthine compound detected at large levels was theobromine, with amounts ranging from 4 to 10 mg·g− 1 for dark chocolate...|$|R
