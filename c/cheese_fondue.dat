This is called la religieuse (French for the nun). It has the texture of a cracker and is almost always lifted out and eaten.|$|E

50|$|In this leg's Detour was {{a choice}} between Cheese and Wheeze. In Cheese, teams {{traveled}} to the Restaurant Walliserkanne Zermatt where {{they would have to}} finish an entire pot of <b>cheese</b> <b>fondue.</b> Once the pot was empty, the restaurateur would give them an empty fondue pot with the name of the next location printed on the inside. In Wheeze, teams had to dress up as bellhops and then pick up pieces of luggage from the Zermatt railway station. Then, using a luggage cart, they had to deliver the suitcases to different hotels throughout Zermatt where they would receive receipt tags for each piece of luggage. Once they had a total of 20 receipt tags from at least five different hotels, they could trade them in to the head porter for their next clue.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{story in}} China that {{suggests}} pizza is an adaptation of the scallion pancake, brought back to Italy by Marco Polo. A humorous newspaper article, that also includes Marco Polo inventing <b>cheese</b> <b>fondue</b> when he is lost in the Alps and wants to eat Chinese hotpot, describes the invention of pizza this way: Marco Polo missed scallion pancakes so much {{that when he was}} back in Italy, he tried to find chefs willing to make the pancake for him. One day, he managed to meet a chef from Naples at a friend's dinner party and persuaded him to try recreating the dish. After half a day without success, Marco Polo suggested the filling be put on top rather than inside the dough. The change, by chance, created a dish praised by everyone at the party. The chefs returned to Naples and improvised by adding cheese and other ingredients and formed today's pizza.|$|E
5000|$|In a light {{form and}} heated over a spirit lamp, a chafing dish {{could also be}} used for cooking various dainty dishes at table - [...] of fish, cream, eggs or cheese - [...] for which silver chafing dishes with fine heat-insulating wooden handles were made in the late 19th century, when [...] "chafing-dish suppers" [...] became fashionable, even in {{households}} where a kitchen maid prepared all the ingredients beforehand. Specialized chafing-dish cookbooks appeared from the 1880s. A book of chafing-dish recipes printed for the silversmiths, Gorham Manufacturing Co. in New York, (2nd edition, 1894), featured a brief history of chafing dishes, followed by proper instruction for use, suggesting its novelty. Fannie Farmers Chafing Dish Possibilities was published in Boston in 1898. Modern chafing dishes are made of light metal or ceramic casseroles with handles, sometimes covered with a Pyrex lid. Classic uses of a chafing-dish are in preparing Welsh rarebit or <b>cheese</b> <b>fondue.</b>|$|E
50|$|At the Pemberley Inn, Betty waits. To {{buy some}} time, she orders <b>cheese</b> <b>fondue</b> from the waiter, who thinks she is there by herself.

As Betty and Gio paint the town red, the family thinks that Betty maybe on her way home. However, it is Henry at the door instead. He says the doctor could not find anything wrong, and so he thinks Charlie was just trying to ruin his night with Betty. Hilda is quick to forgive, but Ignacio isn't so sure.|$|E
5000|$|Queso flameado (Spanish for [...] "flamed cheese"; also queso fundido, [...] "melted cheese" [...] or choriqueso) is {{a dish of}} hot melted {{cheese and}} spicy chorizo that is often served flambé. Often {{compared}} to <b>cheese</b> <b>fondue,</b> it is a party dish; it is popular at cookouts and in restaurants as an appetizer. Almost unique in Mexican cuisine, in the cuisine of the United States this dish has been widely adapted and is considered a native dish in El Paso. In Mexico, it occurs in restaurants more often in the north.Typical main ingredients are melted cheese and a characteristic meat sauce of loose fresh chorizo, tomato, onion, chile and spices. It is served in a small, shallow casserole or other ceramic or metal heat-proof baking dish. The cheese and sauce are prepared separately, and combined just before serving. This may {{be done at the}} table, especially if finished with a flambé: high alcohol liquor is poured on the cheese and ignited, and as it burns the server folds in the sauce. If not flambéed, the mixture may be quickly broiled. Either way, the finished dish is presented while it is still bubbling hot, and it is spooned onto small soft tortillas for individual servings.|$|E
