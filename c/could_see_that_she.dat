[...] I just wanted to do the best job I could do for her. When we would play back 'Holiday' or 'Lucky Star', you <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was overwhelmed by how great it all sounded. You wanted to help her, you know? As much as she could be a bitch, when you were in groove with her, it was very cool, very creative." ...|$|E
500|$|Appearing [...] "frail and {{slightly}} bent", {{she appeared in}} public {{for the opening of}} the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace (now Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum) in Yorba Linda, California on July 19, 1990. The dedication ceremony included 50,000 friends and well-wishers, as well as former Presidents Ford, Reagan, and Bush and their wives. The library includes a Pat Nixon room, a Pat Nixon amphitheater, and rose gardens planted with the red-black Pat Nixon Rose developed by a French company in 1972, when she was first lady. Pat also attended the opening of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California in November 1991. Former First Lady Barbara Bush reflected, [...] "I loved Pat Nixon, who was a sensational, gracious, and thoughtful First Lady", and at the dedication of the Reagan Library, Bush remembered, [...] "There was one sad thing. Pat Nixon did not look well at all. Through her smile you <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was in great pain and having a terrible time getting air into her lungs." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1983, Rebecca Welles {{arranged}} {{to see her}} mother {{for the first time}} in seven years. Speaking to his lifelong friend Roger Hill, Orson Welles expressed his concern about the visit's effect on his daughter. [...] "Rita barely knows me now," [...] Welles said. He recalled seeing Hayworth three years before at an event which the Reagans held for Frank Sinatra. [...] "When it was over, I came over to her table and I saw that she was very beautiful, very reposed looking, and didn't know me at first. After about four minutes of speaking, I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> realized who I was, and she began to cry quietly." ...|$|E
60|$|He <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> then, <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was {{struggling}} to preserve her composure.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Mary Phillips, laughing, [...] "I <b>could</b> never <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> doubted it; I <b>could</b> never <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{objected to}} it. In fact, {{from what she}} said, and, being just us two, of course {{she had to say}} a good many things to me, I think she was very glad to find out that you knew it as well as we did." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And she rather likes being {{helped by}} you. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> when <b>she</b> brought the coffee to you. She likes to stand close--" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{turned her}} head away, and I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was crying.|$|E
60|$|But when we {{met again}} I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had been {{thinking}} seriously.|$|E
60|$|I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was {{determined}} to drive her to a disadvantage if possible.|$|E
60|$|She {{moved in}} her chair a little restlessly. Her eyes avoided mine. Her eyebrows had {{contracted}} a little, but I <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was angry.|$|R
60|$|But <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{not keep}} these tidy little trained {{children}} in order, {{she would not}} have much chance with the street Arabs she had read of.|$|R
6000|$|Miriam {{stared at}} this; then it <b>could</b> be <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> coloured. [...] "What a luxury {{in life to}} have {{everything}} explained! He's the great explainer," [...] she herself explained to Nick.|$|R
60|$|By {{the light}} of the hall lamp I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was very pale.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked up}} at him, and he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was {{inclined}} to believe him.|$|E
60|$|Grace's cheeks flushed, and I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was {{extremely}} gratified, though still tremblingly anxious.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{made some}} words as women will, {{but she got}} ready, and she did look handsomer than ever as she came out. She was excited, I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that,</b> but <b>she</b> was all there! No jugglin' or fussin'.|$|R
6000|$|... "Malcolm, {{turn up the}} light!" [...] I {{carried out}} her orders, and <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that,</b> though <b>she</b> had been crying, her eyes were now dry. Her father saw it too and looked glad. He said to us in a grave tone: ...|$|R
6000|$|In {{the shadows}} that were round them, Alban <b>could</b> just <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was shaking her {{clinched}} fists in the air. He made {{another attempt to}} control her. [...] "Don't excite yourself! If she comes into the garden, she might hear you." ...|$|R
60|$|Now Maqueda {{began to}} speak, quietly enough, {{although}} I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was quaking with passion.|$|E
60|$|Elizabeth was {{bending over}} her dog, but even Tavernake, unobservant though he was, <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was shaken.|$|E
60|$|There was a couch close by, and my {{companion}} sat down. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had turned very white.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Finch {{said that}} anybody with arf an eye <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that,</b> and then <b>she</b> {{looked at a}} kettle that was singing on the 'ob.|$|R
60|$|As {{he spoke}} {{the young lady}} stood silently gazing at me. There was a remnant of a smile upon her face, but I <b>could</b> also <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was a little annoyed. I {{was about to make}} some sort of an {{independent}} answer to the gentleman's remarks, but he anticipated me.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> now. <b>She</b> {{felt sure}} <b>that</b> if <b>she</b> {{told him she}} did not wish ever {{to see him again}} he would never appear before her. But what would he do? She was not in the least afraid of him, but his fierce earnestness frightened her, not for herself, but for him. Suddenly a thought struck her.|$|R
60|$|She drew a {{long breath}} of relief. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was {{trembling}} all over. She sank into a chair.|$|E
6000|$|... "Behold {{the goddess}} and do homage," [...] said Juanna with mock solemnity, {{although}} Leonard <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was trembling with excitement.|$|E
60|$|She {{broke off}} {{abruptly}} in her speech. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was agitated, and I thought that I knew the cause.|$|E
60|$|While {{the child}} spoke they <b>could</b> all <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> wore the magic belt, {{and a great}} cheer went up from all her friends, which was led by {{the voices of the}} Scarecrow and the private. But the Nome King did not join them. He crept back onto his throne like a whipped dog, and lay there bitterly bemoaning his defeat.|$|R
60|$|He <b>could</b> <b>see</b> now <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was clad {{in black}} lace {{from head to}} foot. She looked taller, older, and he fancied even prettier than before. A sudden doubt {{of his ability to}} impress her, a swift {{realization}} of all the difficulties of the attempt, and, for the first time perhaps, a dim perception of the incongruity of the situation came over him.|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{so far as}} I {{can help}} him, he shall succeed," [...] was all Rowland could say. He turned to Miss Garland, to bid her good night, and she rose and put out her hand. She was very straightforward, but he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> if <b>she</b> was too modest to be bold, she was much too simple to be shy. [...] "Have you no charge to lay upon me?" [...] he asked--to ask her something.|$|R
60|$|Then {{there was}} a short silence, and I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was crying under her veil. I laid my hand upon hers.|$|E
60|$|Joan recoiled {{from him}} in panic, tearing herself from his arms and going {{backward}} several steps. He <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was really frightened.|$|E
60|$|This {{time she}} slept about two hours, {{and when she}} woke, even my unpractised eye <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was decidedly better than before.|$|E
60|$|Poor child, her hero was fallen, her {{influence}} had failed, {{and nothing}} was left her but the miserable shame of having trusted {{in the power of}} an attraction which she now felt to have been a delusion. Meanwhile the aunt, by way of being on the safe side, effectually prevented Jock from speaking to her again before the party broke up; and he <b>could</b> only <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was hotly angered, and not <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was keenly hurt.|$|R
6000|$|The countenance of Dus brightened sensibly. Truth herself, {{she gave}} {{immediate}} credit to what I said; and I <b>could</b> not but <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was greatly relieved from some unaccountable apprehension. Still, she {{smiled a little}} archly, and perhaps a little sadly, as she continued-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>could</b> easily <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was {{somewhat}} bloodless, but I <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> the usual anemic signs, {{and by the}} chance, I was able to test the actual quality of her blood, for in opening a window which was stiff a cord gave way, and she cut her hand slightly with broken glass. It was a slight matter in itself, but it gave me an evident chance, and I secured {{a few drops of}} the blood and have analysed them.|$|R
