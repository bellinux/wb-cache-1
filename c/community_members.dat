5|$|Ruffed lemurs are {{cooperative}} breeders, {{with parental}} care being {{shared by all}} <b>community</b> <b>members.</b> For example, mothers will stash their offspring with other mothers or leave them to be guarded by other <b>community</b> <b>members,</b> including non-breeding individuals of both genders. While the mother is away, <b>community</b> <b>members</b> will not only care for and guard them, but also sound alarm calls if danger is detected or if leaving the infant alone. They will also respond to alarm calls by others. These coordinated vigilance displays further involve communal transmission of the alarm call, with nearby <b>community</b> <b>members</b> repeating the alarm call, potentially summoning the mother back to her offspring. Infant transport by {{other members of the}} community has also been recorded. Females have been observed nursing infants of their close relatives, while close kin have adopted rejected infants, acting as foster parents.|$|E

5|$|Alternatively, Suzanne Bergeron, for example, raises {{examples}} {{of studies that}} illustrate the multifaceted effects of globalization on women, including Kumudhini Rosa's study of Sri Lankan, Malaysian, and Philippine, workers in free trade zones {{as an example of}} local resistance to globalization. Women there use their wages to create women's centers aimed at providing legal and medical services, libraries and cooperative housing, to local <b>community</b> <b>members.</b> Such efforts, Bergeron highlights, allow women the chance to take control of economic conditions, increase their sense of individualism, and alter the pace and direction of globalization itself.|$|E

5|$|Ruffed lemurs use alarm {{calls that}} {{differentiate}} between ground and aerial predators. For instance an abrupt roar or huff alerts {{the group to}} an avian predator, and a pulsed squawk or growl-snort communicates {{the existence of a}} mammalian ground predator. When sounding these calls, such as the pulsed squawk, adults direct them at the predator after moving to a safe position. Once the alarm call is sounded by one individual, the resulting chorus can even reach the furthest ranging <b>community</b> <b>members.</b>|$|E
