50|$|A <b>chemical</b> <b>peel</b> is a {{technique}} used to improve and smooth {{the texture of the}} skin. Facial skin is mostly treated, and scarring can be improved. <b>Chemical</b> <b>peels</b> are intended to remove the outermost layers of the skin. To accomplish this task, the chosen peel solution induces a controlled injury to the skin. Resulting wound healing processes begin to regenerate new tissues. The dead skin eventually peels off. The regenerated skin is usually smoother and less wrinkled than the old skin. Some types of <b>chemical</b> <b>peels</b> can be purchased and administered without a medical license, however people are advised to seek professional help from a dermatologist or plastic surgeon on a specific type of <b>chemical</b> <b>peel</b> before a procedure is performed.

50|$|At highest {{concentrations}} (50-70%) {{applied for}} 3 to 8 minutes {{under the supervision}} of a physician, glycolic acid promotes slitting between the cells and can be used to treat acne or photo-damaged skin (e.g. due to mottled dyspigmentation, melasma). The benefit of such short-contact application (chemical peels) depends on the pH of the solution (the more acidic the product, or the lower the pH, the more pronounced the results), the concentration of GA (higher concentrations produce more vigorous response), the length of application and prior skin conditioning such as prior use of topical vitamin A products. Although single application of 50-70% GA will produce beneficial results, multiple treatments every 2 to 4 weeks are required for optimal results. It is important to understand that glycolic acid peels are chemical peels with similar risks and side effects as other peels. Some of the side effects of AHAs <b>chemical</b> <b>peeling</b> can include hyper-pigmentation, persistent redness, scarring, as well as flare up of facial herpes infections ("cold sores").|$|E

RESULTS: Almost all the patients tolerated the procedure well.

Restoration of photodamaged stratum corneum by treatment with SA-PEG, which may affect remodeling of the structural environment of the keratinocytes, involved the normalization of keratinocyte differentiation and suppression of skin tumor development.

40|$|<b>Chemical</b> <b>peeling</b> is the {{application}} of a chemical agent to the skin, which causes controlled destruction of a part of or the entire epidermis, with or without the dermis, leading to exfoliation and removal of superficial lesions, followed by regeneration of new epidermal and dermal tissues. Indications for <b>chemical</b> <b>peeling</b> include pigmentary disorders, superficial acne scars, ageing skin changes, and benign epidermal growths. Contraindications include patients with active bacterial, viral or fungal infection, tendency to keloid formation, facial dermatitis, taking photosensitizing medications and unrealistic expectations. Physicians&#x 2032; qualifications : The physician performing <b>chemical</b> <b>peeling</b> should have completed postgraduate training in dermatology. The training for <b>chemical</b> <b>peeling</b> may be acquired during post graduation or later at a center that provides education and training in cutaneous surgery or in focused workshops providing such training. The physician should have adequate knowledge of the different peeling agents used, the process of wound healing, the technique as well as the identification and management of complications. Facility : <b>Chemical</b> <b>peeling</b> can be performed safely in any clinic/outpatient day care dermatosurgical facility. Preoperative counseling and Informed consent : A detailed consent form listing details about the procedure and possible complications should be signed by the patient. The consent form should specifically state the limitations of the procedure and should clearly mention if more procedures are needed for proper results. The patient should be provided with adequate opportunity to seek information through brochures, presentations, and personal discussions. The need for postoperative medical therapy should be emphasized. Superficial peels are considered safe in Indian patients. Medium depth peels should be performed with great caution, especially in dark skinned patients. Deep peels are not recommended for Indian skin. It is essential to do prepeel priming of the patient&#x 2032;s skin with sunscreens, hydroquinone and tretinoin for 2 - 4 weeks. Endpoints in peels: For glycolic acid peels: The peel is neutralized after a predetermined duration of time (usually three minutes). However, if erythema or epidermolysis occurs, seen as grayish white appearance of the epidermis or as small blisters, the peel must be immediately neutralized with 10 - 15 &#x 0025; sodium bicarbonate solution, regardless of the duration of application of the peel. The end-point is frosting for TCA peels, which are neutralized either with a neutralizing agent or cold water, starting from the eyelids and then the entire face. For salicylic acid peels, the end point is the pseudofrost formed when the salicylic acid crystallizes. Generally, 1 - 3 coats are applied to get an even frost; it is then washed with water after 3 - 5 minutes, after the burning has subsided. Jessner&#x 2032;s solution is applied in 1 - 3 coats until even frosting is achieved or erythema is seen.
