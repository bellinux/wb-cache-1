40|$|<b>College</b> <b>campuses</b> {{are places}} where {{violence}} unfortunately occurs. Sexual assault is a pervasive issue not only on <b>college</b> <b>campuses,</b> but globally. <b>College</b> <b>campuses</b> have {{a unique opportunity to}} change the culture around violence through the work of violence prevention and education offices. These offices are necessary for <b>college</b> <b>campuses</b> if they’d like to see positive culture change. Violence prevention and education offices provide many opportunities to explore issues that arise in communities (e. g. racism, classism, sexism [...] ). For the purpose of this research, liberal arts institutions were examined across the country, similar to Occidental College, then interviews with staff of and reviews of their violence prevention offices were conducted. The campuses that use these offices can change culture by creating inclusive spaces, engaging the community on a regular basis, laying out clear goals and policies, and also giving students a seat at the table. These offices have a place on <b>college</b> <b>campuses</b> and their status should be prioritized by all institutions, ensuring that they are operating at prime efficacy, impacting as many community members as possible...|$|R

Devers opened his headquarters there on 1 October 1946. Further reorganization occurred on 10 March 1948, when Army Ground Forces was renamed Army Field Forces. Control of the armies {{was transferred to the}} Department of the Army, and Army Field Forces was reduced to a coordinating staff agency.|$|E

5|$|During this period, Hardy {{pushed the}} notion of {{granting}} the school college status. In 1921, the California legislature made the school a four-year teacher's school, which placed it under {{the management of the}} State Department of Education. On July 28, 1921, the San Diego Normal School became San Diego State Teachers College (usually shortened to San Diego State College or SDS). With this ranking, the college could now grant certificates and degrees. Prior to the school's conversion, it had graduated 1,500 teachers, educated many of the San Diego children at its training school, and helped to expand the economic and cultural development of the city. Also in 1921, the legislature moved San Diego Junior College, that was a part of San Diego High School, to the <b>college</b> <b>campus</b> due to crowding issues. Administrators moved the junior college believing it would only overlap the same material taught at the teacher's school. The junior college remained with the school until 1947, when it became independent.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Baxter {{heard that}} the New South Wales University of Technology {{was looking for a}} {{professor}} of chemical engineering. He applied, and was offered the job. Baxter and his family packed their belongings and sailed to Australia on the ocean liner Orcades, arriving in Sydney on 16 January 1950. They bought a house in Enfield, where Baxter would reside {{for the rest of his}} life. At the time the university was located in temporary accommodation on the grounds of the Sydney Technical <b>College</b> <b>campus</b> in Ultimo. Baxter became the head of a new School of Chemical Engineering that was created on his arrival, but he initially had only one full-time staff member as most of the instruction was carried out by part-time staff. Although he had no previous teaching experience, he turned out to be a good, well-organised lecturer, and he worked closely with his first postgraduate students, whose research was into fields that Baxter had been involved with in England.|$|E
