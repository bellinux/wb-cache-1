25|$|Around 1902 {{a series}} of Clément-Rothschild bodied automobiles, based on the Panhard-Levassor chassis, were {{produced}} by Carrosserie Clément-Rothschild at 33 Quai Michelet, Levallois-Perret, either adjacent to or in Adolphe Clement's Levallois-Perret factory. There may have been two Rothschild coach-building enterprises active in Paris at that time, because J. Rothschild & Fils traded from 131 Avenue Malakoff but had been founded by Austrian-born Josef Rothschild in 1838 in Levallois-Perret, and was building automobile <b>coachwork</b> by 1894. By 1896 the business had been purchased by Edmond Rheims and Leon Auscher and pioneered aluminium composite <b>coachwork.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Bugatti Type 57S Atalante number 57502, {{built in}} 1937 by Automobiles Ettore Bugatti, {{is one of}} 43 Bugatti Type 57S made and one of only 17 Type 57S {{produced}} with the in-house Atalante coupé <b>coachwork.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{are large}} numbers of PS-type Tigers in preservation, {{carrying}} {{a wide variety of}} <b>coachwork,</b> some double-deck. Being smaller and more mechanically basic than a more modern bus they are perhaps easier to look after, but bodywork can often be very fragile.|$|E
25|$|Production of cars {{restarted}} in 1947 {{with the}} 2-Litre, using the 1991 cc engine from the 16. The 2-Litre used {{an updated version}} of the pre-war, underslung chassis, fitted with the AC straight-six engine and traditional ash-framed and aluminium-panelled <b>coachwork,</b> available in saloon or convertible versions.|$|E
25|$|Scania-Vabis {{continued}} their expansion of production facilities through acquisitions. In 1967, they acquired Katrineholm based <b>coachwork</b> company Svenska Karosseri Verkstäderna (SKV), {{and created a}} new subsidiary, Scania-Bussar. A year later, all bus production, along with R was moved to Katrineholm. Further production locations were added at Sibbhult and Falun, and Scania's employee numbers rose, particularly at Södertälje, which was to help double the town's population.|$|E
25|$|The last {{buses to}} enter service with the Board, the M.A.N. SL202, were ordered in 1984. <b>Coachwork</b> International was {{commissioned}} {{to assemble the}} buses to M.A.N. designs, which were built at their Takanini, Auckland (nos. 612–649) and Palmerston North (nos. 650–669) sites. The Board took delivery of the first vehicle, no. 612, on 5 June 1986. After minor fitout changes and staff training, it commenced its duties with three others of the class on 1 August 1986.|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} {{upmarket}} engineering companies of the time, Alvis {{did not produce}} their own <b>coachwork,</b> relying instead on the many available coachbuilders in the Midlands area, such as Carbodies, Charlesworth Bodies, Cross & Ellis, Duncan Industries, E. Bertelli Ltd, Grose, Gurney Nutting, Hooper, Lancefield Coachworks, Martin Walter, Mayfair Carriage Co, Mulliners, Tickford, Vanden Plas, Weymann Fabric Bodies, and Arnold of Manchester. Several cars also survive with quite exotic one-off bodywork from other designers such as Holbrook, a U.S. coachbuilder.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 the Bugatti Type 57S with {{chassis number}} 57502 built in 1937 with the Atalante <b>coachwork</b> for Francis Curzon, 5th Earl Howe was {{discovered}} in a private garage in Newcastle upon Tyne, having been stored untouched for 48 years and known about only by a select few people. It was auctioned in February 2009 at the Rétromobile motor show in Paris, France, fetching €3.4 million (~ US$5 million), {{becoming one of the}} highest valued cars in automotive history, owing much to its extremely low mileage, original condition and ownership pedigree.|$|E
25|$|Car {{production}} resumed with a four-cylinder model, the TA 14, {{based on}} the pre-war 12/70. A solid, reliable and attractive car, the TA 14 fitted well the mood of sober austerity in post-war Britain, {{but much of the}} magic attaching to the powerful and sporting pre-war models had gone and life was not easy for a specialist car manufacturer. Not only had Alvis lost their car factory but many of the pre-war coachbuilders had not survived either and those that had were quickly acquired by other manufacturers. The post-war history of Alvis was dominated by the quest for reliable and reasonably priced <b>coachwork.</b>|$|E
25|$|This was the Rover Scarab with a {{rear-mounted}} V-twin-cylinder {{air-cooled engine}} announced in 1931, a van version was shown at Olympia, {{but it did}} not go into production. During this time the Rover 10/25 was introduced, with bodies made by the Pressed Steel Company. This was the same body as used on the Hillman Minx. Prior to this time Rover had been a great supporter of the very light Weymann bodies that went suddenly out of fashion with the demand for shiny <b>coachwork</b> and more curved body shapes. Weymann bodies remained in the factory catalogue until 1933.|$|E
25|$|Building on {{aerodynamic}} studies {{developed for}} racing cars, the Cisitalia offers {{one of the}} most accomplished examples of <b>coachwork</b> conceived as a single shell. The hood, body, fenders, and headlights are integral to the continuously flowing surface, rather than added on. Before the Cisitalia, the prevailing approach followed by automobile designers when defining a volume and shaping the shell was to treat each part of the body as a separate, distinct element—a box to house the passengers, another for the motor, and headlights as appendages. In the Cisitalia, there are no sharp edges. Swellings and depressions maintain the overall flow and unity, creating a sense of speed.|$|E
25|$|Arthur and Martin Lilley {{were aware}} that the company's future {{depended}} on the introduction of new, competitive models. Plans to put the Trident into full production were derailed when the Lilleys discovered that Bill Last had commandeered the rights to that design {{during the period of}} confusion between the previous TVR liquidation and the Lilley ownership. TVR engaged Carrozzeria Fissore to build the <b>coachwork</b> for the steel-bodied prototype TVR Tina. David Hives was very heavily involved with the Tina prototype project, and went to Italy with Arthur Lilley to inspect the car. He also accompanied Martin to the 1966 Turin Motor Show. Shortly after this, Hives was dismissed by Martin Lilley for unknown reasons; he was then approached by Bernard Williams and Bill Last to assist in the building of the Trident Clipper.|$|E
25|$|The Fleetwood Body Company of Fleetwood, Pennsylvania, {{was founded}} by Harry Urich in the nineteenth century. It began as a small {{community}} of craftsmen founded by Henry Fleetwood, Esq. of Penwortham, near Lancaster, England (the Fleetwood family flourished in England in the 17th and 18th centuries). The rich traditions of 300 years of coach-building that the Fleetwood Body Company applied to its work on cars secured for it a high reputation in automobile circles worldwide by the 1920s. <b>Coachwork</b> was built by Fleetwood {{for a variety of}} luxury makes through 1924. However, after the Fisher Body Corporation purchased the Fleetwood Body Company in 1925, Fleetwood bodies were reserved exclusively for Cadillac. By 1929 GM had purchased the remaining stock holdings of the Fisher Body Corporation and thus became sole owner of both the Fisher and Fleetwood companies.|$|E
25|$|The PS2 {{followed}} the PD2 Titan in having the 125bhp 9.8-litre O600 engine {{and a new}} synchromesh gearbox. With changes to rules on width and length there were numerous {{different versions of the}} home market PS2 based on permutations of width and length, whether built with or without a rear dropped frame and whether reconstructed from short-wheelbase chassis or built new to the longer wheelbase. PS2/1, 3, 5 and 7 had a 17ft 6in wheelbase for 27ft 6in bodywork. PS2/10, 11, 12, 12A, 13, 13A, 14 and 15 had a longer wheelbase of 18ft 9in for 30ft long <b>coachwork</b> (but see later about the six-wheel PS2/10 and /11). The entire home market Tiger range was vacuum-braked and PS2s for the UK had the synchromesh gearbox only, whilst the Titan PD2 had a number of options including constant-mesh, AEC preselector and Pneumocyclic. The last new PS2 coaches entered service in 1953 with West Riding Automobile Company, and the last home-market customer for the Tiger PS2 bus was the Burnley, Colne and Nelson Joint Transport Committee, their last arrived in 1955 and put in 20 years and more of work, thus being the last half-cab single deckers on normal service in the UK.|$|E

2500|$|This was a UK spec {{production}} run, with 35 cars {{finished in}} Claret <b>coachwork</b> with 2-tone claret/jet interiors. The specifications {{were based on}} the Vogue SE and fitted with the [...] 4.2-litre supercharged [...] Jaguar V8.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the first}} Land Rover pulled {{off after the}} lights turned green, [...] the mortar ‘s improvised grenade was fired by command-wire from the {{backyard}} of the house by IRA members concealed behind a digger. The projectile hit the <b>coachwork,</b> blowing away both sides and {{the roof of the}} military vehicle. [...] Witnesses reported that the Land Rover was “ripped apart”. The soldiers inside were immediately assisted by fellow UDR members, who helped to drag the wounded out of the shattered wreckage.|$|E
2500|$|The {{supercharged}} version, {{often referred}} to as the SJ, was reputed to achieve [...] in second gear and have a top speed of [...] in third gear. Zero-to- times of around eight seconds and [...] in 17 seconds were reported for the SJ in spite of the unsynchronized transmissions, at a time when even the best cars of the era were not likely to reach [...] Duesenbergs generally weighed around two and a half tons; up to three tons was not unusual, considering the wide array of custom <b>coachwork</b> available. The wheelbase was [...]|$|E
2500|$|This {{publicity}} {{contributed to}} touring 15s being bodied by Gaston Grummer, also Argenteuil's director, who produced <b>coachwork</b> {{for the likes}} of Aurora, Olympia, Gloriosa, and Chiquita. The 15 CV was joined by the 12 CV, a [...] four-cylinder car (until 1929), and the 30 CV, with a [...] six cylinder engine (until 1927), while the 15 CV survived until 1932; the 15 CV Sport fell in 1930, losing its last race, the 1931 Monte Carlo Rally, when Donald Healey's Invicta edged Jean-Pierre Wimille by a tenth of a point.|$|E
2500|$|There {{is another}} version of the model J known as the Duesenberg JN (a name never used by the company either). All JNs were sold with Rollston <b>coachwork</b> and only ten were {{produced}} in 1935. In an attempt to give a more modern look to an ageing design, the JN was equipped with smaller -diameter wheels (versus [...] ), skirted fenders, bullet-shaped taillights, and bodies set on the frame rails for a lower look. The battery box and tool box were redesigned slightly so that the doors could close over the frame. Supercharged JNs gained the logical SJN designation.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, {{the term}} [...] "van" [...] refers to {{vehicles}} that, like European minibuses, are even larger than large MPVs and are rarely seen being driven for domestic purposes — except for [...] "conversion vans". These possess extremely large interior space {{and are often}} more intended for hauling cargo than people. Most vans use body-on-frame construction and are thus suitable for extensive modification and <b>coachwork,</b> known as conversion. Conversion vans are often quite luxurious, boasting comfortable seats, soft rides, built-in support for electronics such as television sets, and other amenities. The more elaborate conversion vans straddle the line between cars and recreational vehicles.|$|E
2500|$|The newly revived Duesenberg company {{set about}} {{to produce the}} Model J, which debuted December 1 at the New York Car Show of 1928. In Europe, it was {{launched}} at the [...] "Salon de l'automobile de Paris" [...] of 1929. The first and — {{at the time of}} the New York presentation — only example made of the series, the J-101, was a sweep-panel, dual-cowl phaeton, with <b>coachwork</b> by LeBaron, finished in silver and black. By the time the Great Depression hit in October 1929, the Duesenberg Company had only built some 200 cars. An additional 100 orders were filled in 1930. Thus, the Model J fell short of the original goal to sell 500 cars a year.|$|E
2500|$|Dusio {{commissioned}} several automobiles from Europe's leading designers. He provided Pinin Farina {{with the}} chassis, on which an aluminum body was handcrafted. When first {{presented to the}} public at the Villa d'Este Gold Cup show in Como, Italy, and at the 1947 Paris Motor Show, the two-seat 202GT was a resounding success. The 202 was an aesthetic and technical achievement that transformed postwar automobile body design. The Pinin Farina design was honored by New York's Museum of Modern Art in 1951. In the MOMA's first exhibit on automotive design, called [...] "Eight Automobiles", the Cisitalia was displayed with seven other cars (1930 Mercedes-Benz SS tourer, 1939 Bentley saloon with <b>coachwork</b> by James Young, 1939 Talbot-Lago by Figoni teardrop coupé, 1951 Willys Jeep, 1937 Cord 812 Custom Beverly Sedan, 1948 MG TC, and the 1941 Lincoln Continental coupe). It is still part of the MoMA permanent collection. It was not, however, a commercial success; because it was coachbuilt, it was expensive, and only 170 were produced between 1947 and 1952. Most cars were coachbuilt by Pinin Farina with some by Vignale and Stabilimenti Farina.|$|E
2500|$|In 1965, the rear-engined CR76 was {{introduced}} {{as a replacement}} for the Capitol. It was available in two versions; the CR76M with double doors (2-2-0) for city and suburban traffic, and the CR76L with single doors (1-1-0) for longer distances. Because of Sweden's switch to right-hand traffic in September 1967 and the need for new buses with doors on the right-hand side, the model sold well. With the rebranding from Scania-Vabis to Scania in 1968, the model was renamed CR110 (CR110M and CR110L). In 1967, the <b>coachwork</b> manufacturer Svenska Karosseri Verkstäderna (SKV) in Katrineholm was acquired, and all production of bus chassis soon moved there too. Together with the rebranding in 1968, Scania re-introduced the front-engined CF range for customers in Sweden as a body-on-chassis product with the newly acquired SKV's former bodywork model [...] "6000" [...] on standard Scania chassis, but less than 100 were delivered until 1970. The CF110L (BF110 chassis) was the most successful, while a handful of C80L (B80) and C110L (B110) were made.|$|E

50|$|A {{professional}} car {{in modern}} times is an automobile that has been modified with extensive <b>coachwork</b> for service in livery transportation (limousine) or in funeral home operations (hearses or flower cars).
