5|$|For Super Street Fighter IV, a third outfit {{intended}} {{to resemble the}} Chinese jiangshi was included, consisting of a long Chinese robe, black hat with his ponytail extruding from the top, yellow and black striped pants, and a yellow strip of paper meant to represent a sealing <b>charm</b> extending {{from the front of}} the hat and over his face. The developers considered to have the <b>charm</b> able to be knocked off by an opponent's attacks, and as a result alter his attack patterns and power; however, they felt this overcomplicated the character, and instead abandoned the idea. Assistant producer Natsuki Shiozawa cited the outfit as one of her five favorites in the game, feeling that design suited his body well.|$|E

5|$|There are six {{types of}} quarks, known as flavors: up, down, strange, <b>charm,</b> top, and bottom. Up and down quarks {{have the lowest}} masses of all quarks. The heavier quarks rapidly change into up and down quarks {{through a process of}} {{particle}} decay: the transformation from a higher mass state to a lower mass state. Because of this, up and down quarks are generally stable and the most common in the universe, whereas strange, <b>charm,</b> bottom, and top quarks can only be produced in high energy collisions (such as those involving cosmic rays and in particle accelerators). For every quark flavor there is a corresponding type of antiparticle, known as an antiquark, that differs from the quark only in that some of its properties have equal magnitude but opposite sign.|$|E
40|$|Traditional <b>charms</b> {{are a part}} of English orature; <b>charms</b> in {{literature}} {{are a part of}} English literature. This simple distinction does not, however, tell the whole story: <b>charms,</b> as is well known, are sometimes written down, rather than verbalized, in order to function as talismans; <b>charms,</b> no matter how traditionary, can feature motifs more commonly found {{in literature}}; and the transmission of <b>charms</b> may involve a written as well as an oral dimension (the most obvious example of this being the existence of spellbooks). On the other hand, <b>charms</b> in literature are not always purely literary: they may have a relationship with traditional verbal <b>charms.</b> At the very least, <b>charms</b> presumably existed in real life before they appeared in literature. This paper, which is not a full survey of <b>charms</b> in English literature, will examine some occurrences of supposed <b>charms</b> in literary texts and compare and contrast these items with the generic characteristics of the genuine article...|$|R

5|$|In a 1970 paper, Glashow, John Iliopoulos and Luciano Maiani {{presented}} the so-called GIM mechanism {{to explain the}} experimental non-observation of flavor-changing neutral currents. This theoretical model required {{the existence of the}} as-yet undiscovered <b>charm</b> quark. The number of supposed quark flavors grew to the current six in 1973, when Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa noted that the experimental observation of CP violation could be explained if there were another pair of quarks.|$|E
5|$|In {{less than}} a year, {{extensions}} to the Gell-Mann–Zweig model were proposed. Sheldon Lee Glashow and James Bjorken predicted {{the existence of a}} fourth flavor of quark, which they called <b>charm.</b> The addition was proposed because it allowed for a better description of the weak interaction (the mechanism that allows quarks to decay), equalized the number of known quarks with the number of known leptons, and implied a mass formula that correctly reproduced the masses of the known mesons.|$|E
