40|$|Wood pellet {{production}} in the southern United States {{has more than doubled}} in the past three years, surpassing western Canada as the region in North America with the greatest production. Most of this increase is caused by a few large plants being built specifically for export to Europe where the pellets are burned for electricity. The economics for producers in the region are helped by the decline in manufacture of traditional wood products including structural panels, lumber, and pulp and paper. Demand for wood pellets is set to continue its rapid rise though some of the traditional wood products are also set to rebound. <b>Of</b> concern for <b>pellet</b> producers is both U. S. made pellets? future position in the world energy market as well as their place in the fiber market of the southern United States. In addition, when pellets are stored in large volumes, there is a heating effect. This effect is exacerbated by a hot and humid subtropical climate as well as the feedstock of choice of large producers (Southern Yellow Pine). This heating can cause great expense to producers who are shipping overseas as bulk carriers and European buyers usually have a threshold temperature for biological materials shipped overseas. In addition, this heating often exacerbates convection currents and water deposition inside storage piles before loading. This water can quickly degrade pellets. The first chapter of this thesis looks at the pellet markets worldwide as well as the state of the wood fiber markets in the southern U. S. which made it possible for wood pellet production to get a foothold in the region. It is concluded that use <b>of</b> wood <b>pellets</b> worldwide will grow, with most growth localized in northern Europe and North America. Production in the Southeast will continue to expand, taking much of the fiber that would have been taken by the now shrinking pulp and paper industries though also utilizing residues from sawmilling and possibly harvest residues. The second chapter is a factorial analysis in which production factors such as drying temperature and aging are varied between different production runs at the plant of a large wood pellet producer. Quality attributes such as bulk density, durability, and moisture content <b>of</b> <b>pellets</b> going into storage were also monitored. It was then assessed whether these factors had any effect on the temperatures attained in storage. It was found that the most significant factor in the self heating <b>of</b> <b>pellets</b> was the starting temperature <b>of</b> <b>pellets.</b> Therefore, wood pellet producers may do well by investing in consistent and effective methods <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>pellets</b> after the production runs. Drying temperature also seemed to have a negative correlation to temperature increase though more research is needed as to whether this effect remains when controlling for start temperature...|$|R
40|$|Administration <b>of</b> <b>pellets</b> in fed stomach {{state can}} prolong the gastric {{emptying}} <b>of</b> <b>pellets</b> {{in comparison to}} the administration under fasting conditions [1]. On the basis of literature data we aimed to investigate the influence of caloric value of food on gastric emptying <b>of</b> <b>pellets.</b> A systematic literature search on evaluation of human gastric emptying <b>of</b> <b>pellets</b> based on the technique of gamma scintigraphy was performed in the MEDLINE database. Studies estimating the gastric emptying <b>of</b> <b>pellets</b> under fedconditions were focused. In addition to the caloric value of the meal, a special attention was made on other factors such as, pellets size and density,pellets formulation (filled into capsules or compressed into tablets),a time delay for pellets administration in relation to the time of meal completion, and refreshments provision. The majority <b>of</b> <b>pellets</b> gastric emptying data was presented in terms <b>of</b> <b>pellets</b> t 50 values - a time when 50 % <b>of</b> the administered <b>pellets</b> emptied the stomach. In order to evaluate the influence of the caloric value of the meal on pellets t 50 values a linear regression model was built. In this model the caloric value was regarded as a categorical variable, which was recorded into dummy variables with the lowest caloric value set as a reference. In total 17 studies were recovered, however,only 6 of them met the selection criteria: pellets density between 1. 2 and 1. 5 g/cm 3, administration <b>of</b> the <b>pellets</b> at the time <b>of</b> meal completion, <b>pellets</b> filled into capsules, and pellets size in the range from 0. 6 to 1. 4 mm. In these studies 48 individual values <b>of</b> <b>pellets</b> t 50 were collected (6 or 8 subjects per study) and the obtained caloric values were 1200, 1500, 2300, 2800, and 3600 kJ. Mean value of t 50 <b>of</b> <b>pellets</b> administered right after the 1200 kJ meal was 136 min. In comparison to the 1200 kJ meal, the mean values of t 50 <b>of</b> <b>pellets</b> administered right after 2800 and 3600 kJ meal were significantly longer 212 min (p= 0. 031) and 263 min (p= 0. 003), respectively. No significant difference in terms of mean values <b>of</b> <b>pellets</b> t 50 could be noted between the 1200 kJ meal and 1500 or 2300 kJ meal.

40|$|Studies <b>of</b> fecal <b>pellet</b> flux {{show that}} a large {{percentage}} <b>of</b> <b>pellets</b> produced in the upper ocean is degraded within the surface waters. It is therefore important to investigate these degradation mechanisms to understand the role <b>of</b> fecal <b>pellets</b> in the oceanic carbon cycle. Degradation <b>of</b> <b>pellets</b> is mainly thought {{to be caused by}} coprophagy (ingestion <b>of</b> fecal <b>pellets)</b> by copepods, and especially by the ubiquitous copepods Oithona spp. We examined fecal pellet ingestion rate and feeding behavior of O. similis and 2 other dominant copepod species from the North Sea (Calanus helgolandicus and Pseudocalanus elongatus). All investigations were done with fecal pellets as the sole food source and with fecal pellets offered together with an alternative suitable food source. The ingestion <b>of</b> fecal <b>pellets</b> by all 3 copepod species was highest when offered together with an alternative food source. No feeding behavior was determined for O. similis due to the lack <b>of</b> <b>pellet</b> capture in those experiments. Fecal pellets offered together with an alternative food source increased the filtration activity by C. helgolandicus and P. elongatus and thereby the number <b>of</b> <b>pellets</b> caught in their feeding current. However, most pellets were rejected immediately after capture and were often fragmented during rejection. Actual ingestion <b>of</b> captured <b>pellets</b> was rare (< 37 % for C. helgolandicus and < 24 % for P. elongatus), and only small pellet fragments were ingested unintentionally along with alternative food. We therefore suggest coprorhexy (fragmentation <b>of</b> <b>pellets)</b> to be the main effect of copepods on the vertical flux <b>of</b> fecal <b>pellets.</b> Coprorhexy turns the pellets into smaller, slower-sinking particles that can then be degraded by other organisms such as bacteria and protozooplankton...|$|R

The {{propensity}} for self-heating varies between different types <b>of</b> <b>pellets.</b> It also depends on how the pellets have been handled and on the storage conditions, e. g. the temperature and humidity. Within the framework of the research project “Large scale Utilization of Biopellets for Energy Applications –LUBA” different laboratory-scale methods have been used to study different thermal properties and the propensity for self-heating for different types <b>of</b> <b>pellets.</b> The different methods used include micro calorimetry also called isothermal calorimetry, basket-heating tests and transient plane source (TPS).

Also {{the effect of}} type of granulating liquid (water or Surelease) was investigated on characteristics <b>of</b> selected <b>pellets.</b> The pellets were characterized for particle size (sieve analysis), mechanical strength, morphology (microscopy), thermal (DSC) and dissolution behaviors. Results: The exrtudability of the wet mass was reduced upon inclusion of EC so that complete replacement of MCC was not possible. Increase in EC percentage led to lower production yield and formation <b>of</b> <b>pellets</b> with larger diameter and slightly rough surfaces. Inclusion of EC also affected the mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>pellets</b> but had negligible effect on drug release profile. The surface <b>of</b> selected <b>pellets</b> became smoother and their production yield increased upon the use of Surelease as granulating liquid. In addition the rate of drug release decreased to some extent when Surelease was used. Conclusion: Preparation <b>of</b> theophylline <b>pellets</b> with EC alone was not possible in process of extrusion-spheronization. Partial replacement of MCC with EC changed physicomechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>pellets</b> but hardly affected drug release.
