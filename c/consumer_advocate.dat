5|$|As a legislator, Beshear {{gained a}} {{reputation}} as a <b>consumer</b> <b>advocate,</b> and sponsored bills to increase environmental protections and end the practice of commercial bail bonding. In 1974, Beshear voted against a resolution condemning the practice of desegregation busing because it called for changes to the federal constitution. One of his major accomplishments in the House was spearheading legislation to improve neonatal care at the University of Kentucky Medical Center. Although he considered a 1978 bill requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in Kentucky classrooms to be unconstitutional, he abstained from voting on it rather than voting against it, a move he later claimed he regretted.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} the University of Kentucky College of Law in 1968, Beshear briefly practiced law in New York before {{returning}} to Kentucky and being elected to the state legislature, where he gained {{a reputation as a}} <b>consumer</b> <b>advocate.</b> He parlayed that reputation into a term as attorney general, serving under Governor John Y. Brown, Jr. As attorney general, Beshear issued an opinion that copies of the Ten Commandments would have to be removed from the walls of the state's classrooms {{in the wake of the}} U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Stone v. Graham. He also clashed with first lady Phyllis George Brown when he opposed the practice of charging an admission fee for visitors to view the renovated governor's mansion. In 1983, Beshear was elected lieutenant governor in the administration of Governor Martha Layne Collins. His most significant action in this capacity was the formation of the Kentucky Tomorrow Commission, a panel charged with making recommendations for the future of the state.|$|E

The NHTSA found {{there was not}} enough evidence to warrant a defect investigation. [...] In August 1977, Dowie's [...] "Pinto Madness" [...] article was published a series of accusations against Ford, the Pinto and the NHTSA. These included that Ford knew the Pinto was a [...] "firetrap," [...] and said that Ford did not implement design changes because Ford's cost-benefit analysis document showed that paying out millions in damages in lawsuits was more profitable than the design changes. [...] The day after the article's release <b>consumer</b> <b>advocate</b> Ralph Nader {{and the author of the}} Mother Jones article held a news conference in Washington DC on the alleged dangers of the Pinto's design.

500|$|As president, Hudema {{opposed the}} {{university}} administration's proposed tuition increase, {{and particularly the}} portion of the increase that would see students in some programs pay more than those in others. [...] Despite his opposition, the basic increase was approved as proposed, and two of the three program-based differentials were also approved. [...] He also opposed the extension of degree granting powers (which were only granted to universities at the time) to colleges, advocated against the inclusion of education in the General Agreement on Trade in Services and Free Trade Agreement of the Americas, and unsuccessfully lobbied the City of Edmonton to stop assessing property taxes on university residences. [...] He expanded the Students' Union's involvement in environmental issues - creating a Students' Union environmental office, spearheading an energy audit of the Students' Union's building, passing an ethical buying and purchasing policy, helping to open a Women's Centre on campus, and founding a car pool registry. [...] He also created the Revolutionary Speaker Series; the speakers that Hudema brought to the series included <b>consumer</b> <b>advocate</b> and American presidential candidate Ralph Nader, environmentalist David Suzuki, author Inga Musico, and Palestinian activist Younis al Khatib.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} interest group representation in administrative institutions on regulatory policy. We use a unique panel database of rate reviews conducted for U. S. electric utilities during the 1980 s to assess how <b>consumer</b> <b>advocates</b> and elected agency commissioners affect Public Utility Commission decisions on utilities’ allowed return on equity (ROE) and rate structures. Since PUC decisions are observed generally only when utilities initiate rate reviews, we estimate a sample selection model that first models the utility’s initiation decision and which then corrects for potential selection bias in the population of observed PUC decisions. We find first that utilities postpone rate reviews in states with <b>consumer</b> <b>advocates</b> and elected commissioners. Second, we find that, after controlling for observed and unobserved state characteristics, states with <b>consumer</b> <b>advocates</b> and elected commissioners tended to grant lower ROEs. Additionally, the estimated effects are economically significant: <b>consumer</b> <b>advocates</b> and elected commissioners are associated, respectively, with 0. 19 – 0. 37 and 0. 56 – 2. 1 percentage point reductions in the allowed ROE, ceteris paribus. Changes in rate ratios, however, eliminate these <b>consumer</b> gains: <b>consumer</b> <b>advocates</b> are associated with higher residential-industrial rate ratios, resulting in higher net residential rates. Elected commissioners are associated with lower residential-industrial rate ratios, resulting in higher net industrial rates.

50|$|While many {{environmentalists and}} {{conservation}} advocates support decoupling, many <b>consumer</b> <b>advocates</b> representing utility ratepayers have opposed decoupling as {{it attempts to}} guarantee revenue levels to utility companies. Decoupling mechanisms reduce a utility company's financial risk from reducing sales, due to conservation, weather and economic conditions. As a result, many <b>consumer</b> <b>advocates</b> have requested and state and federal regulators have required that utility companies profit levels (measured through a return on equity allowance) be reduced to reflect lower risk.|$|R
500|$|The Workshop had a {{reorganization}} during 1995, {{and dismissed}} about 12 {{percent of its}} staff. During 1998, {{for the first time}} in the series' history, they accepted funds from corporations for Sesame Street and its other programs, a policy criticized by <b>consumer</b> <b>advocate</b> Ralph Nader. [...] The Workshop defended the acceptance of corporate sponsorship, stating that it compensated for a decrease of government subsidies and financial assistance by PBS. Also during 1998, the Workshop invested $25 million in the cable channel Noggin, initiated during 1999 by the Workshop and Viacom's Nickelodeon. During 2000, the profit the CTW earned from the deal, along with its 1998 revenue caused partly by the [...] "Tickle Me Elmo" [...] craze, enabled the CTW to purchase The Jim Henson Company's rights to the Sesame Street Muppets from the German media company EM.TV, which had acquired Henson earlier that year. The transaction, valued at $180 million, also included a small interest Henson had in the Noggin cable channel. Gary Knell stated, [...] "Everyone, most especially the puppeteers, were thrilled that we were able to bring them home. It protected Sesame Street and allowed our international expansion to continue. Owning these characters has allowed us to maximize their potential. We are now in control of our own destiny".|$|E
500|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, Sesame Street was, as Davis put it, [...] "the undisputed heavyweight {{champion}} of preschool television". [...] Entertainment Weekly reported in 1991 that the show's music had been honored with eight Grammys. [...] The show's dominance, however, was soon challenged by another PBS television show for preschoolers, Barney & Friends, and Sesame Street's ratings declined. [...] The producers of Sesame Street responded, at the show's twenty-fifth anniversary in 1993, by expanding and redesigning the show's set, calling it [...] "Around the Corner". [...] New human and Muppet characters were introduced, including Zoe (performed by Fran Brill), baby Natasha {{and her parents}} Ingrid and Humphrey, and Ruthie (played by comedian Ruth Buzzi). [...] The [...] "Around the Corner" [...] set was dismantled in 1997. [...] Zoe, {{one of the few}} characters that survived, was created to include another female Muppet on the show: her spunky and fearless personality was intended to break female stereotypes. [...] According to Davis, she was the first character developed on the show by marketing and product development specialists, who worked with the researchers at the CTW. [...] (The quest for a [...] "break-out" [...] female Muppet character continued into 2006 with the creation of Abby Cadabby, who was created after nine months of research.) [...] In 1998, {{for the first time in}} the show's history, Sesame Street pursued funding by accepting corporate sponsorship. [...] <b>Consumer</b> <b>advocate</b> Ralph Nader, who had been a guest on the show, urged parents to protest the move by boycotting the show.|$|E
500|$|Little Annie Fanny {{takes the}} reader through the {{changing}} attitudes of American culture, satirizing contemporary trends and fads. In {{each of the}} 107 episodes, Annie experiences the latest popular movie, fashion statement, national politics, or society headline.

Salinger (as [...] "Salinger Fiengold"), NFL champions Green Bay Packers (as the [...] "Greenback Busters"), and Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan, and Sonny& Cher on the [...] "Hoopadedoo Show" [...] (Hullabaloo show). During these early years, the strip pokes fun at miniskirts, LSD, free love, and bra burning. Background caricatures include Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, prissy-but-powerful J.Edgar Hoover, unisex fashion designer Rudi Gernreich, and the [...] "Put a Tiger in Your Tank" [...] ad campaign of Humble Oil. During the 1970s, when the strip ran {{three to five times}} per year, Annie sees violent films such as A Clockwork Orange and The French Connection and meets sex novelist Philip Roth, <b>consumer</b> <b>advocate</b> Ralph Nader, chess champion Bobby Fischer, and shock rocker Alice Cooper. She experiences disco, streaking, C.B.radio, nudist colonies, and women's liberation. Background [...] "eye pops" [...] include Hollywood heavy Charles Bronson, Laugh-In Arte Johnson, the Avis TV commercial's O. J. Simpson, and Star Wars C-3PO. In the 1980s, when Little Annie Fanny appeared once or twice a year, Annie deals with personal computers, goes to Urban Cowboy Gilley's Club, cruises on The Love Boat, and encounters Indiana Jones, Ayatollah Khomeini, Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker, and Woody Allen.
