5|$|The American crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos) {{is a large}} {{passerine}} {{bird species}} of the family <b>Corvidae.</b> It is a common bird found throughout much of North America.|$|E
5|$|The family <b>Corvidae</b> {{includes}} crows, ravens, jays, choughs, magpies, treepies, nutcrackers {{and ground}} jays. Corvids are above average in size among the Passeriformes, {{and some of}} the larger species show high levels of intelligence.|$|E

40|$|Two recent papers {{analysing}} nuclear DNA sequence data shed {{new light}} on the origin of perching birds (Passeriformes) and the structure of their radiation. Both papers find that the New Zealand wrens Acanthisitta fall {{at the base of the}} passerine radiation, implying an origin of this clade in Gondwana. Additionally, among oscine passerines (songbirds), both papers fail to support a sister group relationship between the largely Australo–Papuan <b>Corvida</b> and the Afro–Eurasian Passerida, as outlined in Sibley and Ahlquist’s tapestry. Rather, they converge on a phylogeny in which the Passerida is nested within the <b>Corvida...</b>|$|R
50|$|Consider {{for example}} songbirds. These {{can be divided}} into two groups - <b>Corvida,</b> which retains ancient {{characters}} in phenotype and genotype, and Passerida, which has more modern traits. But only the latter are a group of closest relatives; the former are numerous independent and ancient lineages which are about as distantly related to each other as each single one of them is to the Passerida. In a phenetic analysis, the large degree of overall similarity found among the <b>Corvida</b> will make them appear to be monophyletic too, but their shared traits were present in the ancestors of all songbirds already. It is the loss of these ancestral traits rather than their presence that signifies which songbirds are more closely related to each other than to other songbirds. However, the requirement that taxa be monophyletic - rather than paraphyletic {{as in the case of}} the <b>Corvida</b> - is itself part of the cladistic view of Taxonomy, not necessarily followed to an absolute degree by other schools.|$|R
50|$|It is not {{closely related}} to either true Old World Warblers or the New World Warblers, but belongs rather to the <b>Corvida</b> parvorder {{comprising}} many tropical and Australian passerines, as well as crows.|$|R
5|$|The family <b>Corvidae</b> {{includes}} crows, ravens, jays, choughs, magpies, treepies, nutcrackers, {{and ground}} jays. Corvids are above average in size for the Passeriformes. Some {{of the larger}} species show high levels of learned behavior. Five species have been recorded in South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|The closest {{relative}} of the choughs as indicated by a study of molecular phylogeny is the ratchet-tailed treepie (Temnurus temnurus) and they form a clade that is sister to the remaining living members of the <b>corvidae.</b> The genus Pyrrhocorax species differ from Corvus in that they have brightly coloured bills and feet, smooth, not scaled tarsi and very short, dense nasal feathers. Choughs have uniformly black plumage, lacking any paler areas as seen in some of their relatives. The two Pyrrhocorax are the main hosts of two specialist chough fleas, Frontopsylla frontalis and F. laetus, not normally found on other corvids.|$|E
5|$|Carl Linnaeus {{described}} the grey jay as Corvus canadensis in the 12th {{edition of his}} Systema Naturae in 1766. William John Swainson named it Dysornithia brachyrhncha in 1831. French ornithologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte assigned the grey jay to the genus Perisoreus in 1838 in A geographical and comparative list of the birds of Europe and North America, along with the Siberian jay, P. infaustus. The grey jay belongs to the crow and jay family <b>Corvidae.</b> However, it {{and the other members}} of its genus are not closely related to other birds known as jays; they are instead close to the genus Cyanopica, which contains the azure-winged magpie. Its relatives are native to Eurasia, and ancestors of the grey jay are thought to have diverged from their Old World relatives and crossed Beringia into North America.|$|E
25|$|More recently, the {{grouping}} {{has been}} refined somewhat {{as the original}} concept of <b>Corvida</b> has proven paraphyletic. The narrower 'Core corvine' group now comprises the crows and ravens, shrikes, birds of paradise, fantails, monarchs, drongos and mudnest builders.|$|R
50|$|The {{relationship}} of the Petroicidae to other bird families is uncertain; Sibley and Ahlquist's DNA-DNA hybridisation studies placed the Australian robins in a <b>Corvida</b> parvorder comprising many tropical and Australian passerines including pardalotes, fairy-wrens and honeyeaters as well as crows.|$|R
25|$|Infraorder <b>Corvida</b> – {{a highly}} {{diverse group of}} global distribution, but most {{plentiful}} in the Australasian region and surroundings: The oldest truly globally successful group of passerines, they include among them what {{may well be the}} most intelligent and the most spectacular of the order.|$|R
5|$|The Stresemann's bushcrow (Zavattariornis stresemanni), {{also known}} as Abyssinian pie, bush crow, Ethiopian bushcrow, or by its generic name Zavattariornis, is a rather starling-like bird, which is {{currently}} thought to be member of the crow family, <b>Corvidae,</b> though this is uncertain. It is slightly larger than the North American blue jay and is a bluish-grey in overall colour which becomes almost white on the forehead. The throat and chest are creamy-white with the tail and wings a glossy black. The black feathers {{have a tendency to}} bleach to brown at their tips. The iris of the bird is brown and the eye is surrounded by a band of naked bright blue skin. The bill, legs, and feet are black.|$|E
5|$|The grey jay (Perisoreus canadensis), also gray jay, Canada jay, or whisky jack, is a {{passerine}} bird of {{the family}} <b>Corvidae.</b> It is found in boreal forests of North America north to the tree line, and in the Rocky Mountains subalpine zone south to New Mexico and Arizona. A fairly large songbird, the grey jay has pale grey underparts, darker grey upperparts, and a grey-white head with a darker grey nape. It {{is one of three}} members of the genus Perisoreus, a small genus more closely related to the Cyanopica genus of magpies than to other birds known as jays. The grey jay itself has nine recognized subspecies.|$|E
25|$|Mate {{selection}} is quite complex and accompanied with much social {{play in the}} <b>Corvidae.</b> Youngsters of social corvid species undergo a series of tests, including aerobatic feats, before being accepted as a mate by the opposite sex.|$|E
5000|$|Sibley and Alquist's DNA-DNA {{hybridisation}} studies {{placed the}} robins in a <b>Corvida</b> parvorder comprising many tropical and Australian passerines including pardalotes, fairy-wrens and honeyeaters {{as well as}} crows. However, subsequent molecular research (and current consensus) places the robins as a very early offshoot of the Passerida ("advanced" [...] songbirds).|$|R
25|$|<b>Corvida</b> and Passerida were {{classified}} as parvorders in the suborder Passeri; {{in accord with the}} usual taxonomic practice, they would probably be ranked as infraorders. As originally envisioned in the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy, they contained, respectively, the large superfamilies Corvoidea and Meliphagoidea, as well as minor lineages, and the superfamilies Sylvioidea, Muscicapoidea, and Passeroidea.|$|R
5000|$|Passerida is, {{under the}} Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy, {{one of two}} [...] "parvorders" [...] {{contained}} within the suborder Passeri (standard taxonomic practice would place them at the rank of infraorder). While more recent research suggests that its sister parvorder, <b>Corvida,</b> is not a monophyletic grouping, the Passerida as a distinct clade are widely accepted.|$|R
25|$|<b>Corvidae</b> is a {{cosmopolitan}} family of oscine passerine birds {{that contains the}} crows, ravens, rooks, jackdaws, jays, magpies, treepies, choughs, and nutcrackers. In common English, they are known as the crow family, or, more technically, corvids. Over 120 species are described. The genus Corvus, including the jackdaws, crows, rooks, and ravens, makes up {{over a third of}} the entire family.|$|E
25|$|The quail-thrushes, jewel-babblers, {{whipbirds}} and wedgebills were traditionally {{included with}} the logrunners (Orthonyx) in the family Orthonychidae. Sometimes the Malaysian rail-babbler and blue-capped ifrit (Ifrita kowaldi) were {{also included in the}} family. In 1985, Sibley and Ahlquist found that the logrunners were not related to the others and included only the logrunners in the Orthonychidae. They treated the others as the subfamily Cinclosomatinae within their expanded family <b>Corvidae.</b>|$|E
25|$|Common cuckoos (Cuculus canorus) {{have been}} noted as regular brood parasites of L. e. excubitor in the past; for reasons unknown this has ceased since the late 1970s or so. It {{may well be that}} the cuckoo's gens laying eggs {{similar to those of the}} great grey shrike has become extinct. Among predators of eggs and nestlings, corvids (<b>Corvidae)</b> – {{extremely}} close relatives of the shrikes (Laniidae) as it happens – are most significant.|$|E
50|$|Like {{many other}} members of the <b>Corvida,</b> the white-breasted robin is a {{cooperative}} breeder; breeding pairs are often assisted by one or more helper birds who help raise young. Helper birds are mostly male; female birds are more likely to leave the territory {{in the first year of}} their life, while males are more likely to remain.|$|R
40|$|The {{systematic}} {{relationships among}} avian families within Crown <b>Corvida</b> have been poorly studied {{so far and}} as such been of limited use for biogeographic interpretations. The group has its origin in Australia and {{is thought to have}} colonized Africa and the New World via Asia beginning some 35 Mya when terranes of Australian origin approached Asian landmasses. Recent detailed tectonic mapping of the origin of land masses in the region around Wallace’s line have revealed a particularly complex movement of terranes over the last 20 – 30 Myr. Thus the biogeographic dispersal pattern of Crown <b>Corvida</b> is a particularly exciting case for linking vicariance and dispersal events with Earth history. Here we examine phylogenetic affinities among 72 taxa covering a broad range of genera in the basal radiations within Crown <b>Corvida</b> with an emphasis on Campephagidae and Pachycephalidae. Bayesian analyses of nuclear DNA sequence data identified the family Campephagidae as monophyletic but the large genus Coracina is not. Within the family Pachycephalidae the genera Pachycephala and Colluricincla are paraphyletic with respect to each other. The resulting phylogeny suggests that patterns of dispersal across Wallace’s line are complex and began at least 25 Mya. We find evidence of explosive radiations and multi-directional dispersal within the last 10 Myr, and three independent long distance ocean dispersal events between Wallacea and Africa at 10 – 15 Mya. Furthermore, the study reveals that in the Campephagidae a complex series of dispersal events rather than vicariance is the most likely explanation for the current biogeographic pattern in the region...|$|R
50|$|<b>Corvida</b> Raven is a writer, {{technological}} artist, entrepreneur {{and public}} speaker who {{lives and works}} out of New York City, New York. She has been garnering national attention {{since the age of}} 19 for her blog, shegeeks.net, and other projects aimed at making technological skills and information accessible to the public at large, and particularly to youth, people of colour, women and marginalized communities.|$|R
25|$|The {{families}} {{are sorted into}} a somewhat novel sequence unlike that in older works, where e.g. <b>Corvidae</b> are placed last. This is because so many reallocations have taken place since about 2005 that a definite taxonomy has not been established yet, although the phylogeny is by and large resolved. The present sequence {{is an attempt to}} preserve as much of the traditional sequence while giving priority to adequately addressing the phylogenetic relationships between the families. Based on John Boyd's Taxonomy in Flux Checklist 3.5.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that most corvids are not {{threatened}} (many even increasing due to human activity) a few species are in danger. For example, the destruction of the Southeast Asian rainforests is endangering mixed-species feeding flocks with members from the family <b>Corvidae.</b> Also, since its semiarid scrubland habitat is an endangered ecosystem, the Florida scrub jay has a small and declining population. A number of island species, which are more vulnerable to introduced species and habitat loss, have been driven to extinction, such as the New Zealand raven, or are threatened, like the Mariana crow.|$|E
25|$|Within the {{literature}} {{it has been}} found that certain species of paridae and <b>corvidae</b> (such as the black-capped chickadee and the scrub jay) are able to use spatial memory to remember where, when and what type of food they have cached. Recent studies with rats and squirrels, have also suggested that they are able to use spatial memory to locate previously hidden food. Experiments using the radial maze have allowed researchers to control for a number of variables, such as the type of food hidden, the locations where the food is hidden, the retention interval, as well as any odour cues that could skew results of memory research. In particular, studies have indicated that rats have memory for where they have hidden food and what type of food they have hidden. This is shown in retrieval behaviour, such that the rats are selective in going more often to the arms of the maze where they have previously hidden preferred food than to arms with less preferred food or where no food was hidden.|$|E
50|$|The white-breasted robin (Eopsaltria georgiana) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Petroicidae. It is endemic to southwestern Australia. Unlike many other Australian robins, it lacks bright colours in its plumage, being a {{predominantly}} greyish bird with white underparts. Like many other Australian passerines of the <b>Corvida</b> group, it is a cooperative breeder. It is sedentary, with pairs or small groups maintaining territories.|$|R
5000|$|Like all Australian robins, {{it is not}} {{closely related}} to either the European robin or the American robin, but belongs rather to the <b>Corvida</b> parvorder {{comprising}} many tropical and Australian passerines including pardalotes, fairy-wrens and honeyeaters as well as crows. It belongs to the genus Eopsaltria, whose Australian members are known colloquially as [...] "yellow robins" [...] as distinct from the [...] "red robins" [...] of the genus Petroica.|$|R
40|$|The cnemophiline 'birds of paradise' (Cnemophilinae) and Macgregor's 'bird of paradise' (Macgregoria) have {{traditionally}} {{been included in the}} Paradisaeidae although their relationships within the group have been enigmatic and subject to repeated discussion in the literature. Here we use sequences from two mitochondrial genes, cytochrome b and cytochrome oxidase I, along with a suite of morphological characters, to investigate their relationships to paradisaeids {{and other members of the}} passerine Parvorder <b>Corvida.</b> The combined data strongly support the removal of both groups from the birds of paradise: the cnemophilines are basal members of the Corvoidea and Macgregoria is a member of the Meliphagoidea and embedded in the honeyeaters (Meliphagidae) close to the genus Melipotes. The amount of sequence divergence among basal passeriforms and members of the <b>Corvida,</b> as well as available fossil evidence for Australian corvidans, suggest that cnemophilines represent an ancient lineage within the corvoid radiation. Because cnemophilines and Macgregoria have been placed at the base of the paradisaeid tree, hypotheses of morphological, behavioural and ecological character-state transformations within the family will require reanalysis...|$|R
25|$|The family <b>Corvidae</b> was {{introduced}} by the English zoologist William Elford Leach in {{a guide to the}} contents of the British Museum published in 1820. Over the years, much disagreement has arisen on the exact evolutionary relationships of the corvid family and their relatives. What eventually seemed clear was that corvids are derived from Australasian ancestors and from there spread throughout the world. Other lineages derived from these ancestors evolved into ecologically diverse, but often Australasian groups. In the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, Sibley and Ahlquist united the corvids with other taxa in the Corvida, based on DNA–DNA hybridization. The presumed corvid relatives included currawongs, birds of paradise, whipbirds, quail-thrushes, whistlers, monarch flycatchers and drongos, shrikes, vireos, and vangas, but current research favors the theory that this grouping is partly artificial. The corvids constitute the core group of the Corvoidea, together with their closest relatives (the birds of paradise, Australian mud-nesters, and shrikes). They are also the core group of the Corvida, which includes the related groups, such as Old World orioles and vireos.|$|E
25|$|The true {{evolutionary}} affinities of the sittellas {{have long}} been clouded by their close resemblance to the Northern Hemisphere nuthatches. As late as 1967 the sittellas were retained in that family by some authorities, although doubts about that placement had been voiced in the previous decades. Both their climbing technique and overall morphology are extremely similar; however they differ both in their sociality and their nesting behaviour, as sittellas create nests on branches whereas nuthatches nest in cavities in trees. In addition {{the specifics of the}} morphology of the leg differed, with sittellas having leg muscles more {{similar to those of the}} honeyeaters. Their placement was then moved to various families, including the Old World babblers (an infamous wastebin taxon), the true treecreepers (Certhiidae, which range across the Holarctic and Africa) and the Australian treecreepers (Climacteridae). Their relationship with the Australian radiation of passerines was suggested by S.A. Parker on the basis of egg colour, nest structure and nestling plumage, and their position in this radiation was vindicated by Sibley and Ahlquist's DNA–DNA hybridization studies. These researchers placed the sittellas in a monotypic tribe within the superfamily <b>Corvidae.</b> Today they are afforded their own family in a clade close to the berrypeckers and longbills (Melanocharitidae) and the whistlers (Pachycephalidae).|$|E
25|$|Studies with captive {{birds have}} given insight into which birds {{are the most}} intelligent. While parrots are able to mimic human speech, studies with the African grey parrot have shown that some are able to {{associate}} words with their meanings and form simple sentences. Along with crows, ravens, and jays (family <b>Corvidae),</b> parrots are considered the most intelligent of birds. The brain-to body size ratio of psittacines and corvines is {{comparable to that of}} higher primates. One argument against the supposed intelligent capabilities of bird species is that birds have a relatively small cerebral cortex, which is {{the part of the brain}} considered the main area of intelligence in other animals. However, birds use a different part of the brain, the mediorostral HVC as the seat of their intelligence. These species tend to have the largest hyperstriata, and Harvey J. Karten, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego, who studied bird physiology, has discovered that the lower part of the avian brain is functionally similar to that in humans. Not only have parrots demonstrated intelligence through scientific testing of their language-using ability, but also some species of parrots such as the kea are also highly skilled at using tools and solving puzzles.|$|E
50|$|The Sibley-Ahlquist {{arrangement}} differs {{greatly from}} the more traditional approach used in the Clements taxonomy. More recently published phylogenetic reconstructions based on cladistic and maximum likelihood analyses of DNA sequences lend credence {{to some of the}} DNA-DNA hybridization-based taxonomy, e.g. the recognition of palaeognathous birds as monophyletic and sister to all others. However, later studies failed to support many of the rearrangements in the Sibley-Ahlquist classification, such as the monophyly of the <b>Corvida.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Described by Italian naturalist Tommaso Salvadori in 1874, the slaty robin is {{a member}} of the Australasian robin family Petroicidae, or Eopsaltridae. Sibley and Ahlquist's DNA-DNA {{hybridisation}} studies placed this group in a <b>Corvida</b> parvorder comprising many tropical and Australian passerines including pardalotes, fairy-wrens, honeyeaters and crows. However, subsequent molecular research (and current consensus) places the robins as a very early offshoot of the Passerida (or [...] "advanced" [...] songbirds), within the songbird lineage.|$|R
5000|$|Members {{within the}} Psophodes genus {{are closely related}} to the quail thrushes within the <b>Corvida</b> family Cinclosomatidae. The eastern whipbird is known to be one of four species of the Psophodes genus. Rogers and Mulder (2004) [...] also suggest two sub-species of the eastern whipbird, the {{southern}} P. livaceus and the northern P. lateralis. These two sub-species have been identified based on their geographic location within Australia as well as their morphology and plumage.|$|R
