50|$|The Ford Boss 302 is a {{high-performance}} small block 302 cuin L V8 engine manufactured by Ford Motor Company. The original {{version of this}} engine {{was used in the}} 1969 and 1970 Boss 302 Mustangs and was constructed by attaching heads designed for the planned 351 Cleveland (which debuted the following year) to a Windsor engine block. The construction was aided by the two engines sharing a <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>bolt</b> pattern, though the Boss heads had to have their coolant passages slightly modified.|$|E
50|$|The 1969-70 Boss 302 (Hi-Po) {{engine was}} created in 1968 for the SCCA's 1969 Trans-Am road racing series. Available in the Boss 302 Mustangs of 1969-70, it's a unique Ford small-block engine {{featuring}} a thin-wall, high nickel content block casting. It differed substantially from regular 302s, with 4-bolt mains, screw in freeze plugs, and heads using a canted valve design being developed for the planned 351 Cleveland (which debuted the following year). The construction was aided by the two engines sharing a <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>bolt</b> pattern, though the Boss 302 heads had to have their coolant passages slightly modified.|$|E
50|$|All 335 Series V8s {{shared the}} same 4.38 in bore spacing and <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>bolt</b> pattern as the Windsor V8s. Beyond these shared aspects, the 335 Series engines are very {{different}} internally from the somewhat similar-looking Windsor series. The 335 series V8s use smaller 14mm spark plugs and the radiator hose locations differ between the Windsor and 335 engines. The Windsor engines route coolant through the intake manifold, with the hose protruding horizontally, while the 335 engines had a dry manifold with the radiator hose connecting vertically to the cylinder block above the cam timing chain cover. The Cleveland has a square-shaped rocker cover while the Windsor has a more rounded cover. All 335 covers are secured with eight bolts; the Windsor uses six bolts. All of the 335 series engines differ from the Windsor engines by having a roughly 2-inch extension {{at the front of}} the block which forms an integrated timing cover casting.|$|E

25|$|Andrew Freeman of Grand Forks, North Dakota, {{invented the}} <b>head</b> <b>bolt</b> heater around 1940 and {{received}} a patent for it on November 8, 1949. In 1951, Freeman received another patent on an improved <b>head</b> <b>bolt</b> heater. These early heaters replaced one of the engine's <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>bolts</b> with a hollow, threaded shank containing a resistive heating element. Before the block heater was introduced, people {{used a variety of}} methods to warm engines before starting them, such as pouring hot water on the engine block or draining the engine's oil for storage inside overnight. Some even shoveled embers underneath their vehicle's engine to obtain the same effect.|$|R
5000|$|In common usage, the {{distinction}} (not rigorous) is often that screws {{are smaller than}} bolts, and that screws are generally tapered while bolts are not. For example, <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>bolts</b> are called [...] "bolts" [...] (at least in North American usage) {{despite the fact that}} by some definitions they ought to be called [...] "screws". Their size and their similarity to a bolt that would take a nut seem linguistically to overrule any other factors in this natural word choice proclivity.|$|R
40|$|Large {{static strain}} {{appears on the}} fillet on upper deck of diesel engine {{cylinder}} block by tightening force of cylinder head bolts. Reducing static strain is necessary to avoid the crack initiation on the fillet. The static strain along the fillet can be reduced, for example, by modifying the depth of thread engagement, and modifying the bead shape and position into the bore grommet of cylinder head gasket. In the present study, the depth of thread engagement was optimized considering four conditions, the overall magnitude of strain, the circumferential fluctuation of strain, the change rate of strain against the depth of thread engagement, {{and the length of}} <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>bolt.</b> The bead shape or position was optimized considering two conditions, the overall magnitude of strain, and the distribution of contact pressure on the contact area with the cylinder block and the cylinder liner. The analysis results of the circumferential distribution of static strain were agreed with the measurement results. The optimum depth of thread engagement of <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>bolt</b> and the optimum type of the cylinder head gasket were evaluated using FEM...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{finite element}} {{analytical}} {{model of a}} diesel engine is established to analyze the stress, the flatness, the roundness {{and the rate of}} light leakage of the diesel engine block. The analysis result shows that the optimized scheme improves the body's stress concentration and deformation obviously: the tensile stress between the upper cylinder sleeve shoulders spigot and the counter bore of <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>bolt</b> decreases by 15 % compares to the original diesel engine block. The maximum stress decreases obviously and the stress concentration region moves down slightly by changing the “T ” type stiffener above the head of the block into rectangular stiffener; the flatness of the end surface of cylinder liner spigot decreases by 11. 3 %; the circularity and the rate of light leakage of each cross section on cylinder liner decreases obviously...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the vibration history of the engine block and predict its surface vibration status, a FEM model on 4102 BZQ Diesel Engine block was constructed. Based on the cylinder pressure curve of 4102 BZQ, some important exciting forces applied on the block were calculated. ANSYS software was used to compute and analyze dynamic response of the block. Simultaneously the node displacement history of the block model was obtained. The results of calculation and analysis showed that the vibration of the block skirts was more intense and the skirt was the main factor to influence {{the reliability of the}} engine. <b>Cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>bolt</b> force and piston slap force had significant effect on the top area of the block, and the surface vibration of the skirt was strongly influenced by the crank shaft load...|$|E
5000|$|... Ford/International used four Torque to Yield (TTY) <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>bolts</b> per <b>cylinder</b> for the 6.0s and 6.4s. TTY bolts {{offer some}} of the most precise {{clamping}} force available, but can be problematic. In certain situations (Oil cooler/EGR cooler failure, high boost/load levels brought on by improper use of aftermarket programmers) TTY bolts can be stretched beyond their torque mark by increased cylinder pressures. This has never been addressed by Ford {{due to the fact that}} other malfunctions or abuse must occur to stretch the bolts. Some in the aftermarket will replace the factory <b>bolts</b> with <b>head</b> studs in an attempt to protect the head gaskets from future failure. If this is done without addressing the underlying issue, the head gaskets may fail again bringing along a cracked or warped <b>cylinder</b> <b>head.</b> In contrast, the Powerstroke 7.3s and 6.7s have 6 <b>head</b> <b>bolts</b> per <b>cylinder</b> while the IDI 7.3s and 6.9s have five.|$|R
50|$|Due to the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> design (Removal of {{the heads}} was {{designed}} to be accomplished whilst leaving the camshaft and valvetrain in place), <b>head</b> <b>bolts</b> were both vertically and diagonally set in the engine block, to be accessible around the camshafts. As the bolts were made of the same material and set on different angles; this created areas of different expansion under heat, creating not only head warping but resulting in extremely difficult to remove <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads</b> as <b>bolts</b> stretched and corroded in place at different rates.|$|R
50|$|A long-bolt or {{through-bolt}} {{engine is}} an internal combustion piston engine where, following usual practice, the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> is held down by bolts or studs. Conventionally the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> is <b>bolted</b> to the cylinder block and the crankshaft main bearings are in turn {{bolted to the}} crankcase by separate bolts. In the long-bolt engine however, a single set of long bolts is used, spanning from the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> right through to the crankshaft bearing caps.|$|R

50|$|In motorsport, this {{engine was}} always {{hampered}} {{by some of}} its old design features. Despite of having a long stroke (84 mm bore x 90 mm stroke) the engine needed lots of revs to deliver sufficient power with a significant lack of torque at lower revs. In that respect the Lampredi engine was always inferior to the contemporary Ford Twin Cam with its Cosworth-developed head with much more modern geometry. In theory, the Fiat engine could {{have been changed to}} a much shorter stroke. This would have meant that the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>bolts</b> would need to be moved. These bolts made it impossible to enlarge the engine’s bore and they also were responsible for an unfortunate routing of the intake channels in the cylinder to avoid these bolts. Moving the bolts would have meant developing a new <b>cylinder</b> <b>head.</b> Abarth technicians {{were on their way to}} develop a new head when Lampredi found out and made it very clear that he absolutely refused any change to “his” engine.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} reduce the mass ratio of S 1110 diesel engine, {{structural}} intensity and stiffness analysis are performed on the assembly parts of engine body by using the finite element method. Through comparative analysis of more than one calculation scheme, optimization scheme has been got. To ensure the intensity and stiffness of the engine body is not reduced under the premise, optimization scheme makes the body mass greatly reduced from the original engine body’s 38 kg to 13. 8 kg and the engine mass ratio is reduced from 13. 2 kg/kW to 11. 81 kg/kW. The results show that, changing the body material from cast iron materials to cast aluminum materials, the body stress distribution trends are similar, but the cast aluminum body deformation increases; increasing the number of <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>bolts</b> to 6 can reduce the deformation of the cylinder liner; a reasonable set of stiffeners can reduce the bearing bore deformation...|$|R
40|$|The {{reciprocating}} compressor manifold design {{is very important}} for the compressor to achieve the goals of energy efficiency, acoustic and reliability. In the same level of importance, the design must take in count the cost related with manufacturing process and raw material. The main components involved in the manifold design are the cylinder, piston, valve plate, valves, <b>cylinder</b> <b>head,</b> <b>bolts</b> and gaskets. The design of a {{reciprocating compressor}} manifold is a multifunctional activity, which involves knowledge from thermal, acoustic, structural and tribology areas. The objective {{of this paper is to}} present the main aspects related with the structural analysis of the manifold. The main interest is the manifold deformation, but special attention is dedicated to the pressure on the gasket. The analysis is performed by the finite element method, and it involves highly non-linear aspects because of the gasket behavior. The gasket properties are determined by a special experimental procedure. Some experimental results are presented to verify the precision of the methodology used...|$|R
50|$|In 1942, at {{the height}} of World War II, Bill Brodey was engaged in selling various tools and {{machines}} including Joseph Sunnen honing machines used for honing cylinder bores of engines. Torque wrenches were being imported and sold alongside of the honing machines because it was known that uneven torque tightening of engine <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>bolts</b> would distort the cylinder bore. Bill and his friend Ernest Thornitt applied to the UK Ministry of Supply requesting permission to manufacture torque wrenches in the UK. Torque wrenches were much in demand for the manufacture of Rolls-Royce Merlin aero engines and the UK Government was keen to manufacture in the UK wherever possible to reduce pressure on the Atlantic supply convoys. Consequently, permission was granted to 'The North Bar Tool Company' to start manufacturing torque wrenches in 'North Bar Place', Banbury in the United Kingdom. The address 'North Bar' gave the company its name and this was later contracted to 'Norbar'.|$|R
5000|$|To {{support the}} new fuel system, the intake {{manifold}} {{was of a}} new design. Known colloquially as the [...] "beer keg" [...] or [...] "kegger" [...] manifold, the part was shaped like half of a beer barrel lying longitudinally atop {{the center of the}} V-shaped engine block. The intake runners, which supplied the fuel and air to each cylinder, fed each of the intake ports in the newly designed <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads.</b> The <b>bolts</b> that secured the intake manifold to the <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads</b> were installed at a different angle than those on the older LA engine; they threaded in vertically, rather than at the 45-degree angle of the '66-up LA.|$|R
40|$|Parts with a {{functional}} micro contour or a micro structure {{are needed in}} {{a large number of}} applications. Manufacturing process with a geometrically defined cutting edge are usually rare for such applications. Reasons for this are limited dynamics and accuracy of the existing machine tools. An example of use is the compensation of elastic deformations in cylinder crankcases due to fastening of <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>bolts</b> during theirs assembly and general operating conditions. Under unoptimized conditions this results in non-circular cylinder bores, also sometimes called a four-leafed clover owing to its similarity. In the state of the art, torque plates are used during the honing operation to compensate the deformations or a novel method - called form honing - is applied. The Fraunhofer IWU developed a piezo-based spindle support for high dynamic positioning of the cutting edge. Thereby it's possible to manufacture non-circular cylinder holes in one of the very first machining operations. This enables a decrease in processing time of cylinder crankcases and in manufacturing more complex and more precise cylinder contours. The spindle support consists of eight high volt piezo actuators in a differential arrangement around a flexure, in whom the spindle is fastened. The flexure itself allows three degrees of freedom (jx, jy, z) for displacement of the HSC-spindle. Depending on tool length, displacements of the tool center point up to ± 60 ìm were achieved and four-leafed clover shaped cylinder bores were manufactured at speeds up to 6000 rpm...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. An experimental investigation {{was conducted to}} access methods of detecting, and localizing faults in a diesel engine. A three cylinder, two stroke Detroit 3 - 53 engine was heavily instrumented for time resolved measurements. In particular, a 3, 600 count per revolution optical encoder was used along with accelerometers mounted on various engine structures, in-cylinder pressure measurements {{and a variety of}} steady state sensors, such as exhaust temperatures. A large number of baseline data were taken to establish the statistical characteristics on the signals from the engine. These runs were followed by a series of experiments where the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> assembly <b>bolt</b> torque were varied parametrically. Standard spectral analysis and Joint Time Frequency Analysis (JTFA) were used to identify the fundamental vibration characteristics of the engine. The vibration frequencies were checked for consistency against first order models of the engine assembly and reasonable agreement was found. In addition, a new technique for accessing engine health using time of arrival of encoder signals was investigated. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R
2500|$|American Motors {{introduced}} a die-cast aluminum block {{version of the}} OHV [...] engine in 1961. It was produced through 1964. This engine used cast-iron cylinder liners and a cast-iron <b>head.</b> The <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads</b> for {{the two types of}} block (aluminum and cast iron) are of similar design, but are not interchangeable. The <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> for the aluminum block is roughly 1/8" [...] wider than that for the cast iron [...] block and uses a slightly different <b>head</b> <b>bolt</b> pattern.|$|R
50|$|The {{engineers}} also {{revised the}} compression ratio in the 400ci through {{the installation of}} different <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads</b> with smaller combustion chambers (1977 Pontiac 400 engines also had the 350 <b>heads</b> <b>bolted</b> to the 400 blocks, these heads were known as the 6x-4 heads and {{were taken from the}} Pontiac 350). This increased power by 10% for a total of 220 during the 1978-79 model years. The 400/403 options remained available until 1979, when the 400 CID engines were only available in the 4-speed transmission Trans Ams and Formulas (the engines had actually been stockpiled from 1978, when PMD had cut production of the engine).|$|R
5000|$|The Seagull {{outboard}} motor had a simple single cylinder water-cooled two-stroke engine. Atop {{the engine was}} a magneto, and on its port side was a simple carburetter with no air filter. Even a rudimentary rubber [...] "storm cowl" [...] was an optional extra, and induction noise when running was pronounced. Above the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> was <b>bolted</b> a small brass fuel tank whose 10:1 fuel/oil mix was gravity-fed to the carb via a clear plastic tube that served to capture dirt particles in its U-bend. A simple plastic filter filter on the banjo union to the carb gave rudimentary secondary filtering, {{but it was still}} not unusual for the carb jets to become blocked. Starting was effected with a hand-wound pull-rope, although a recoil starter became an option in due course. Connecting the motor to the gearbox and propeller werere two downtubes, the forward one containing the drive shaft and the aft tube serving as the exhaust, which vented underwater. This arrangement meant that the engine could not be rotated 360 degrees as can more modern engines. The Seagull handbook advises that the engine can be safely run at full throttle (partly to prevent the spark-plug from oiling up) but adds that is wasteful to try to exceed the maximum design speed of a displacement hull, suggesting a [...] "one-third open throttle" [...] usually suffices. The engines proved very rugged as they used high quality materials, and would last for years even in harsh marine environments and in developing countries. Seagull outboards were utilitarian in nature with a relatively slow-turning prop, and so were ideal for use in dinghies, tenders and small yachts. The Silver Century Plus model could propel a displacement hull of up to 26 feet in length; but all Seagull outboards were unsuitable for high speed craft.|$|R
50|$|Up to late 1999, this {{engine type}} {{suffered}} from oil leaks between {{the block and}} <b>cylinder</b> <b>head.</b> The threads for the <b>head</b> <b>bolts</b> near the 4th cylinder were bored too shallow at the factory, preventing the head from properly sealing. The oil restrictor in the composite gasket would separate from the gasket causing a leak. Chrysler Corporation used several different designs of composite material head gasket {{in an attempt to}} solve this problem. In 1998, a thicker multi-layer steel head gasket was introduced that eliminated this oil leak. It can be identified by a small metal tab with a hole through its center sticking out between the block and head between the 2nd and 3rd cylinders.|$|R

25|$|A {{block heater}} warms {{the engine of}} an {{automobile}} in order to ease and speed starting and vehicle warm-up in cold weather. The most common type is an electric heating element connected through a power cord often routed through the vehicle's grille.

The block heater, first known as a <b>head</b> <b>bolt</b> heater, was invented in 1945 by Andrew Freeman in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Freeman used some scrap hoses and copper tubing onto the heating element of an old flat-iron and produced the first headbolt heater, which warmed the engine's water jacket and the oil film between <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads</b> and pistons.

5000|$|For 1987, Chevrolet {{once again}} made some {{revisions}} to increase overall reliability, {{many of them}} borrowed from the TBI L03, which was to replace the LG4. The coil-in-cap HEI distributor was retired, and an all-new electronic distributor design was used. The intake manifold to <b>head</b> <b>bolt</b> pattern was redesigned to improve gasket integrity - four of the center intake manifold bolts were drilled at 72 degrees instead of 90 degrees for the cast iron <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads.</b> Changes to the valve covers were also made. [...] "ribbing" [...] {{was added to the}} top of the valve covers to increase surface area, acting as a heat sink. To improve intake gasket sealing, the mounting bolts were relocated to the valve cover centerline, placing all sealing pressure evenly upon the mounting flange perimeter... thus these became known as [...] "centerbolt valve covers", first introduced in 1985 on the LB4 4.3L V6 and the Corvette a year earlier (the aluminum <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads</b> used with the Vette were the first to have the centerbolt valve covers). Another improvement was utilization of a hydraulic lifter/roller camshaft on most '87 LG4's. Some early engines have lifter retainer provisions, but utilize the older, non-roller camshaft. 1987 would also be the last year for the LG4 production, however a run of LG4 engines was made to supplement the carry-over production for the 1988 Monte Carlo and the 1988 Chevrolet Caprice.|$|R
