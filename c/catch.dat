40|$|The {{mosquito}} {{sampling efficiency}} of light-trap <b>catches</b> and electric motor mosquito <b>catches</b> {{were compared with}} that of human biting <b>catches</b> in the Three Gorges Reservoir. There was consistency in the sampling efficiency between light-trap <b>catches</b> and human biting <b>catches</b> for Anopheles sinensis (r = 0. 82, P, 0. 01) and light-trap <b>catches</b> were 1. 52 (1. 35 – 1. 71) times that of human biting <b>catches</b> regardless of mosquito density (r = 0. 33, P. 0. 01), while the correlation between electric motor mosquito <b>catches</b> and human biting <b>catches</b> was found to be not statistically significant (r = 0. 43, P. 0. 01) and its sampling efficiency was below that of human biting <b>catches.</b> It is concluded that light-traps can be used as an alternative to human biting <b>catches</b> of Anopheles sinensis in the study area and is a promising tool for sampling malaria vector populations...|$|R

5|$|The fair <b>catch</b> kick is a rule at the {{professional}} and high school levels of American football that allows {{a team that has}} just made a fair <b>catch</b> to attempt a free kick from the spot of the <b>catch.</b> The kick must be either a place kick or a drop kick, and if it passes over the crossbar and between the goalposts of the defensive team's goal, a field goal, worth three points, is scored to the offensive team.|$|E
5|$|The fair <b>catch</b> kick rule states that, after {{a player}} has {{successfully}} made a fair <b>catch</b> or {{has been awarded}} a fair <b>catch</b> (as {{the result of a}} penalty such as kick <b>catch</b> interference), their team can attempt a kick from the spot of the catch; the NFHS also allows a kick to be made if the down following the fair <b>catch</b> or awarded fair <b>catch</b> has to be replayed. Prior to the kick, the opposing team must be lined up at least ten yards beyond the spot of the ball. The kick itself can be either a place kick or drop kick; a kicking tee cannot be used at the professional level, but use of a tee up to two inches in height is permitted at the high school level. Like other field goal attempts, the kicking team is awarded three points if the kick goes above the crossbar and between the goalposts of the opposing team's goal and did not touch a player of the offensive team after the kick. If the attempt fails, the opposing team is awarded control of the ball from the spot of the kick. The opposing team can also return the kick if it does not go out of bounds.|$|E

5|$|Despite its drawbacks, {{there are}} several {{advantages}} to using the fair <b>catch</b> kick. Because the defense is required to be ten yards beyond the spot of the kick, the kicker can take a running start before kicking {{as opposed to the}} typical two steps taken on regular field goal attempts. Similarly, the kicker does {{not have to worry about}} a low snap because the ball is not snapped. The defense is not able to block the kick, allowing the kicker to give the ball a lower trajectory than usual. The fair <b>catch</b> kick would also be of a shorter distance than a normal field goal attempt from the same spot, because the fair <b>catch</b> kick is taken from the spot of the <b>catch,</b> while a typical field goal is taken seven yards back from the line of scrimmage.|$|E
