5|$|Although {{the force}} was {{commanded}} by its commissioner, {{there was also}} an influential senior post of <b>comptroller,</b> created in 1880 in response to Macleod's financial mismanagement of the force. For most of the force's history the role was occupied by Frederick White, until replaced by A. A. Mclean in 1913. The <b>comptroller</b> was responsible for keeping account of expenditure, auditing and managing procurement, and effectively removed most of the non-operational functions from the commissioner's responsibility. White was a political client of Prime Minister John Macdonald, who took a close interest in the management of the force, and the post became critical for garnering support from Ottawa for investment in the police.|$|E

5|$|Smallpeice {{formally}} joined BOAC on 1 January 1950, {{taking the}} title and role of financial <b>comptroller.</b> The title reflected his intention to provide useful financial information to managers within the company, allowing them to take informed decisions, rather than dictating what the company would be doing from head office. The financial <b>comptroller</b> position became a board position in 1953, and accordingly Smallpeice {{was appointed to the}} board. He would then be promoted to the additional position of deputy chief executive in June 1954.|$|E
5|$|The {{appointment}} of Colin Campbell as <b>comptroller</b> general in 1966 fostered substantial changes within Fremantle Prison itself. One {{of his first}} changes was to clear the classification committee's backlog of prisoners awaiting assessment. Campbell also established an officer training school, {{as well as an}} assessment centre to evaluate new prisoners. Work release and community service programs were also introduced, along with training programs, social workers and welfare officers. Within the midst of Campbell's reforms, the Prisons Department was renamed the Department of Corrections in 1971, restructured, and the position of <b>comptroller</b> general was replaced with director of the department.|$|E

5|$|Ashmole {{embarked}} on further catalogues, {{including one of}} the Roman coin collection of the Bodleian Library, which he finally completed in 1666 {{after eight years of}} work. It may have taken so long because Ashmole's progress was interrupted by the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, when Ashmole's loyalty was richly rewarded with political offices. He was appointed Secretary and Clerk of the Courts of Surinam and <b>Comptroller</b> of the White Office. While these two titles do not seem to have provided either an income or any specific duties, he also became Commissioner and then <b>Comptroller</b> for the Excise in London, and later was made the Accountant-General of the Excise, a position that made him responsible for {{a large portion of the}} King's revenue.

5|$|Further {{action was}} not taken until 1902, when new {{regulations}} for prison officers {{were published in}} the Government Gazette. A new Prison Act was passed in 1903, replacing sixteen previous acts. It provided for classification of prisoners, provision of adequate work for prisoners, and the creation of the position of <b>comptroller</b> general of prisons, to assume the functions the sheriff had undertaken as inspector of prisons. While in theory the passing of the act should have been a landmark moment in prison reform, this did not eventuate. The legislation left much of the changes to executive regulation, at the discretion of the governor, and was described by the media as a feeble document. Other problems included Fremantle Prison's inscrutability for classification, due to its design, and that the sheriff was allowed to hold the office of <b>comptroller</b> general of prisons, effectively making it no more than a change in name.|$|E

[...] Nonetheless, City Limits found, the <b>Comptroller's</b> office and the Bloomberg administration have in fact engaged in hundreds of [...] "low-level skirmishes" [...] over the <b>Comptroller's</b> audits of city agencies and programs, but Thompson has not audited the mayor's office and mayoral agencies as often as his predecessor, Alan Hevesi, did under Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. City Limits concluded that [...] "the {{jury is still out on}} what impact Thompson's audits have had on city services — and whether his record as an auditor will matter in the <b>comptroller's</b> current run for mayor." ...|$|R
