40|$|Free {{movement}} of <b>capital</b> <b>and</b> <b>payments</b> {{is one of}} four fundamental principles, whose undisturbed operation is vital for proper functioning of the Common Market. In the first stage of the European Community, this freedom served a rather ancillary function, facilitating the full use of the freedom of {{movement of}} goods, people and services.

The treaty regulations concerning free movement of <b>capital</b> <b>and</b> <b>payments</b> changed. These regulations obtained the status of direct effectiveness, which means that natural and legal persons may invoke them in courts and domestic institutions. However, the most essential role in forming the principle of free movement of <b>capital</b> <b>and</b> <b>payments</b> was played by European Court of Justice, whose judgments contributed to its present shape and allowed practically full liberalization of free movement of cash.

40|$|In 1991, Congress {{passed the}} Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA). The Act {{provided}} for risk-based deposit insurance premiums, put explicit {{limits on the}} application of a “too big to fail” principle for banks and required that examiners implement “prompt corrective action” (PCA) standards for banks. Essentially these steps were to improve the functioning of the FDIC, especially removing discretion of the examiners in the process of addressing the risk of failure of banks and providing explicit requirements of managing the deteriorating risk of failure and providing for rising insurance premiums for such banks. In particular, PCA established a set of capital benchmarks and required regulator actions that removed privileges for banks to manage their <b>capital</b> <b>and</b> <b>payments</b> of income to share holders and bank creditors as the capital position of the bank deteriorated and the risk of failure rose. In effect regulators could take preemptive action to keep banks from depleting their capital as their capital positions deteriorate. These provisions have drawn increasing public attention in the past year for very different reasons. First, Senate Bill 40, The National Insurance Act (NIA), which provides new opportunities for insurance companies to obtain their charters and to be regulated by a federal government entity instead of only the state governments, also requires that the new federal regulator develop and apply prompt corrective action provisions to the supervision of federally chartered insurance companies. The second reason that these provisions have drawn attention recently is the near failure and sale of Bear Stearns. The Federal Reserve helped arrange the sale of Bear Stearns in March 2008, with the sale to be completed shortly, to preempt its failure and consequent effects on other financial institutions. At about the same time the U. S. Department of Treasury released it long awaited “Blueprint for a Modernized Federal Financial Regulatory Structure,” that called for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to have broad regulatory power over all financial institutions on issues related to financial market stability. These actions call attention to the absence of regulatory oversight powers by the Fed, in particular, enabling legislation that would allow the Fed to close investment banks or other failed or failing institutions {{in the same way that}} they can or must close such banks. PCA is on the horizon for insurance companies, investment banks and other financial institutions subject to regulation. ...|$|E

40|$|Restrictions on {{international}} <b>capital</b> transactions <b>and</b> other <b>payments</b> are usually designed to limit volatile short-term capital flows (“hot money”) and stabilize the exchange rate. Their imposition, however, {{may have the}} opposite effect by inadvertently signaling the continuation of macroeconomic imbalances and inconsistent (“bad”) future policy (Bartolini and Drazen, 1997 a,b). This paper investigates these alternative hypotheses by testing the impact of restrictions {{on international}} <b>capital</b> flows <b>and</b> other <b>payments</b> controls on the likelihood of currency crises. We employ a comprehensive sample of 90 developing and emerging-market economies over the 1975 - 1997 period, identifying 160 currency crises. Restrictions on international capital flows, current accounts, <b>and</b> international <b>payments</b> {{are associated with a}} higher probability of the onset of a speculative attack on the currency. This finding is robust to alternative measures of liberalization on international <b>payments</b> <b>and</b> the exchange rate regime, controlling for macroeconomic determinants of currency instability, and taking into account instability emanating from the banking sector. There may be some individual exceptions but the weight of the evidence suggests that countries imposing capital restrictions are sending a “bad signal” to markets, in turn increasing the likelihood of a net <b>capital</b> outflow <b>and</b> a currency crisis. ...|$|R

Moreover increases in the working capital employed in the system decrease the total operational cost, increase the total financial cost and lower the return on working capital investment.

40|$|Results of {{application}} of the data mining to solving the problem of actuarial processes modeling and risk estimation for insurance companies are presented. As a mathematical modeling tool the following approaches were used: generalized linear models, Bayesian networks, the group method for data handling, fuzzy GMDH, and Bayesian parameter estimation techniques. Using actual statistical data from the insurance industry, new generalized linear models were constructed that were used for estimation of a possible loss by an insurance company. Also, a model {{in the form of}} a Bayesian network was constructed that was applied to estimate the bankruptcy risk in a case of insurance losses. The best model constructed in this case turned out to be the gamma distribution based model and logarithmic link function whose parameters were estimated within four iterations of the estimation algorithm. A substantial computed value of the insurance company bankruptcy risk reflects the fact that the company under consideration does not possess an effective mechanism for managing its own <b>capital</b> <b>and</b> the <b>payments</b> from clients. Thus, an application of data mining is an effective approach to solving the problems of short-term forecasting financial processes and estimation of actuarial risks. ???????????? ?????????? ?????????? ??????? ????????????????? ??????? ?????? ? ?????????? ????????????? ? ?????????? ?????? ????????? ????????. ? ???????? ??????????????? ???????? ???????????? ?????????? ???????? ??????, ????? ?????????? ????? ?????????? ? ???????? ????? ?????????? ????? ??????????, ? ????? ??????????? ?????? ? ?????????? ??????????? ?????????? ???????. ?? ?????? ??????????? ?????????????? ?????? ?? ??????? ??????????? ????????? ????? ?????????? ???????? ?????? ??? ?? ??????????? ????????????? ??? ?????????? ?????? ?????? ????????? ????????, ??????????? ? ???????????? ???? ?????? ??? ?????????? ????? ??????????? ????????? ???????? ??? ??????????? ?????????? ??????. ?????????? ??? ??????????? ????????????? ????????? ?????? ? ?????-?????????????? ?????? ? ??????????????? ???????? ?????, ????????? ??????? ???????? ?? ?????? ???????? ????????? ??????????. ??????? ???? ??????????? ????????? ???????? ??????????????? ?? ?????????? ???????????? ????????? ?????????? ????????? ?????????? ??? ???????????? ????????, ??? ? ??????? ?? ????????? ?????????. ?????????? ??????? ????????????????? ??????? ?????? ???????? ??????????? ???????? ? ??????? ????? ??????????????? ? ?????????? ?????? ????????? ?????????...|$|R
