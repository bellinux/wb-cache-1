The roles of ABA in cellular growth and morphogenesis, however, {{remain to be}} explored. Here, we report that ABA induces the ectopic outgrowth of epidermal cells in Arabidopsis thaliana. Seedlings of A. thaliana germinated and grown {{in the presence of}} ABA developed ectopic protrusions in the epidermal cells of hypocotyls, petioles and cotyledons. One protrusion was formed in the middle of each epidermal cell. In the hypocotyl epidermis, two types of <b>cell</b> <b>files</b> are arranged alternately into non-stoma <b>cell</b> <b>files</b> and stoma <b>cell</b> <b>files,</b> ectopic protrusions being restricted to the non-stoma <b>cell</b> <b>files.</b> This suggests the presence of a difference in the degree of sensitivity to ABA or in the capacity of cells to form protrusions between the two <b>cell</b> <b>files.</b> The ectopic outgrowth was suppressed in ABA insensitive mutants, whereas it was enhanced in ABA hypersensitive mutants. Interestingly, ABA-induced ectopic outgrowth was also suppressed in mutants in which microtubule organization was compromised. Furthermore, cortical microtubules were disorganized and depolymerized by the ABA treatment. These results suggest that ABA signaling induces ectopic outgrowth in epidermal cells through microtubule reorganization...|$|R

40|$|Plants are sessile {{organisms in}} need to {{acclimate}} {{to the changes}} in the surrounding environment by changing their metabolism and growth behavior. Responses to external stimuli such as gravity, light, or touch can result in tightly coordinated growth responses, regulating the final shape and size of an organ. The coordination of organ growth has to occur on several levels. Plant cells are surrounded by a rigid cell wall, which governs final cell shape and cell size. These walls allow for expansion by deposition and loosening of cell wall material; and simultaneously for directionality through alignment of the load-bearing cellulose fibrils. At the same time, these cell walls generate a connecting matrix that links adjacent cells and requires for these cells to grow in units, so called symplastic growth. ^ In plants with helical aligned cell files along axial organs, this connection through the cell wall is thought to cause cells to rotate in-phase around the organ axis, with a decrease of <b>cell</b> <b>file</b> length and angle towards organ axis from the outer cell layers inwards. At the same time, if cell anisotropy is not altered, the organ diameter increases dependent on the angle described by the cell files. ^ In addition to these biomechanical constraints imposed on cells within one organ, cell directionality also affects organ growth behavior. If elongating cells are oriented helically around an axial organ, their growth axis is not aligned with the organs growth axis. The cell growth vector can be divided into its components parallel and perpendicular to the organ growth axis, the first one drives organ growth, the second a rotation of the organ tip, both in an angle dependent manner. Organ growth is decreased, most likely due to the parallel vector component being shorter than the cell growth vector. ^ Cell directionality is regulated by several cellular factors. Cortical microtubules are positioned along the plasma membrane of the cell. In elongating cells they are organized in parallel arrays, approximately perpendicular to the growth axis of the cell, forming 2 ̆ 2 hoop-like 2 ̆ 2 structures around the cell. They are thought to guide cellulose producing enzyme complexes into and within the plasma membrane, resulting in cellulose fibrils being aligned in a similar manner. Cellulose fibril alignment in turn guides turgor pressure driven expansion, and thus directionality of cell expansion. In this work, the mutant twd 1, defective in a FKBP-like immunophilin that displays a helical <b>cell</b> <b>file</b> orientation, was used to elucidate relationships between cell-cell and cell-organ growth, as well as to investigate cortical microtubules and cell wall components in regard to the altered <b>cell</b> <b>file</b> orientation. ...|$|E

Loss-of-function mutations in NEK 6 (nek 6 /ibo 1) cause ectopic outgrowth and microtubule disorganization in epidermal cells. We recently found that NEK 6 forms homodimers and heterodimers with NEK 4 and NEK 5 to destabilize cortical microtubules possibly by direct binding to microtubules and the β-tubulin phosphorylation. Here, we identified a new allele of NEK 6 and further analyzed the morphological phenotypes of nek 6 /ibo 1 mutants, along with alleles of nek 4 and nek 5 mutants. Phenotypic analysis demonstrated that NEK 6 {{is required for}} the directional growth of roots and hypocotyls, petiole elongation, <b>cell</b> <b>file</b> formation, and trichome morphogenesis. In addition, nek 4, nek 5, and nek 6 /ibo 1 mutants were hypersensitive to microtubule inhibitors such as propyzamide and taxol.

The <b>cell</b> <b>file</b> rotations of the root epidermis of wav 2 - 1 in the wavy growth pattern were enhanced in both right-handed and left-handed rotations. WAV 2 encodes a protein belonging to the BUD EMERGENCE 46 family with a transmembrane domain at the N terminus and an α/β-hydrolase domain at the C terminus. Expression analyses showed that mRNA of WAV 2 was expressed strongly in adult plant roots and seedlings, especially in the root tip, the cell elongation zone, and the stele. Our results suggest that WAV 2 is not involved in sensing environmental stimuli but that it negatively regulates stimulus-induced root bending through inhibition of root tip rotation...|$|E

30|$|The {{length and}} number of root hairs are {{regulated}} by genetic factors. Their formation follows one of three patterns: 1) random, any cell of the epidermis being capable of root-hair development; 2) alternative, morphologically different cells alternating along longitudinal epidermal <b>cell</b> <b>files,</b> with asymmetric <b>cell</b> division creating a pattern of shorter hairs and longer non-hair cells; or 3) striped, root hairs and non-hair cells occurring in separate longitudinal files (Dolan and Costa 2001; Datta et al. 2011; Marzec et al. 2014). Root hairs form in epidermal cells that overlie the junction of two cortical <b>cell</b> <b>files</b> (H-position), but not in epidermal cells overlying single cortical cells (N-position). In rice, the patterning of H and N <b>cells</b> along <b>files</b> in the root epidermis is random (Kim and Dolan 2011).

40|$|Root hair pattern {{develops}} {{in a number}} of different ways in angiosperm. Cells in the epidermis of some species undergo asymmetric cell divisions to form a smaller daughter cell from which a hair grows, and a larger cell that forms a non-hair epidermal cell. In other species any cell in the epidermis can form a root hair. Hair cells are arranged in files along the Arabidopsis root, located in the gaps between underlying cortical cell files. Epidermal cells overlying a single cortical <b>cell</b> <b>file</b> develop as non-hair epidermal cells. Genetic analysis has identified a transcription factor cascade required for the formation of this pattern. WEREWOLF (WER) and GLABRA 2 (GL 2) are required for the formation of non-hair epidermal cells while CAPRICE (CPC) is required for hair cell development. Recent analyses of the pattern of epidermal cells among the angiosperms indicate that this striped pattern of cell organization evolved from non-striped ancestors independently {{in a number of}} diverse evolutionary lineages.

40|$|Using {{monoclonal}} tubulin and actin antibodies, Al-mediated alterations to microtubules (MTs) and actin microfilaments (MFs) {{were shown}} to be most prominent in cells of the distal part of the transition zone (DTZ) of an Al-sensitive maize (Zea mays L.) cultivar. An early response to Al (1 h, 90 μm) was the depletion of MTs in cells of the DTZ, specifically in the outermost cortical <b>cell</b> <b>file.</b> However, no prominent changes to the MT cytoskeleton were found in elongating cells treated with Al for 1 h in spite of severe inhibition of root elongation. Al-induced early alterations to actin MFs were less dramatic and consisted of increased actin fluorescence of partially disintegrated MF arrays in cells of the DTZ. These tissue- and development-specific alterations to the cytoskeleton were preceded by and/or coincided with Al-induced depolarization of the plasma membrane and with callose formation, particularly in the outer cortex cells of the DTZ. Longer Al supplies (> 6 h) led to progressive enhancements of lesions to the MT cytoskeleton in the epidermis and two to three outer cortex cell files. Our data show that the cytoskeleton in {{the cells of the}} DTZ is especially sensitive to Al, consistent with the recently proposed specific Al sensitivity of this unique, apical maize root zone...|$|E

The average final length of leaf 7 {{of the main}} stem of the smallest species (Poa alpina) was only one-half that of the largest species (Poa trivialis); it was correlated with leaf elongation rate, {{but not with the}} duration of leaf elongation. A faster rate of leaf elongation rate was associated with (a) larger size of the zone of cell expansion, and (b) faster rates of cell production (per <b>cell</b> <b>file)</b> in the meristem, which in turn were due to greater numbers of dividing cells, whereas average cell division rates were very similar for all species (except Poa annua). Also we found that the proliferative fraction equaled 1 throughout the meristem in all species. It was remarkable that rates of cell expansion tended to be somewhat higher in the species with slower growing leaves. We discuss the results by comparing the spatial and material viewpoints, which lead to different interpretations of the role of cell division. Although the presented data do not strictly prove it, they strongly suggest a regulatory role for cell division in determining differences in growth rate among the present four Poa spp...|$|E

The {{relationship}} between culm anatomy and the rht (reduced height) system of wheat was studied in rhtl (GA-sensitive, tall) and Rhtl (GA-insensitive, semidwarf) spring wheat F isolines.

Counting the number of fibre <b>cell</b> <b>files</b> in the cortex of the first internode at heading time, we found no structural differences between the tall (rhtl) and the semidwarf (Rhtl) isolines.

These results identify CPC and TRY as positive regulators of stomata formation in the embryonic stem, which increases the similarity between the genetic control of root hair and stoma cell fate determination...|$|R
40|$|The Arabidopsis root has {{a simple}} {{structure}} From a developmental perspective, the Arabidopsis root is {{a paragon of}} simplicity. A small number of stem cells {{at the tip of}} the root generate all of the cell types through stereotyped divisions followed by cell differentiation and regulated cell expansion (Fig. 1 a).

By measuring the length of all stamens and pistils in inflorescences and the reference growth rate of pistils, we constructed growth curves of pistils and stamens between stages 12 and 15 of flower development. Pistil growth was found to consist of a single exponential growth, while stamen growth consisted of three exponential phases. During the second exponential phase, {{the growth rate of}} stamen filaments was ～ 10 times greater than the growth rates in the other two phases. Consequently, stamens whose growth was initially retarded grew longer than the pistil, putting pollen grains on the stigma. msg 2 - 1 stamens, on the other hand, exhibited a less obvious growth increase, resulting in less frequent contact between anthers and stigma. MSG 2 was expressed in the stamen filaments and its expression almost coincided with the second growth phase. Stamen filaments appeared to elongate by cell elongation rather than cell division in the epidermal <b>cell</b> <b>file.</b> Considering that MSG 2 {{is likely to be a}} direct target of the auxin F-box receptors, MSG 2 may be one of the master genes that control the transient growth increase of stamen filaments...|$|E
40|$|Epidermal {{cells of}} the Arabidopsis thaliana root are derived from a ring of 16 or so {{initials}} (stem cells) that are located just below the quiescent centre of four central cells. Derivatives of these initials divide transversely in the meristematic region of the root to produce files of cells that subsequently elongate and differentiate. There {{are two kinds of}} <b>cell</b> <b>file</b> in the epidermis, hair cells and non-hair cells, that are organised in an ordered pattern and become distinguishable within a few divisions of the initials. It is likely that local intercellular communication {{plays an important role in}} the early establishment of this pattern, enabling cells to register their position and fate. We have therefore examined the extent to which cells in the root apex are symplastically coupled through plasmodesmata. Using a variety of dye loading methods we show that the undifferentiated cells are dye-coupled i. e. cells in the meristem and the elongation zone are symplastically connected, but that cells gradually become symplastically isolated as the cells differentiate. By the time that visible hair outgrowth is observed the {{cells of the}} epidermis are symplastically isolated. This resembles the pattern of gap-junction connectivity observed in many animal systems where cells are coupled at the stage that cell patterns become established, but become progressively more isolated as they differentiate...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of the post-embryonic root epidermis of Arabidopsis thaliana is described. Clonal analysis has identified three sets of initials {{that give rise to}} the columella root cap cells, epidermis and lateral root-cap cells, and the cells of the cortex and endodermis respectively. The mature epidermis is composed of two cell types, root hair cells (derived from trichoblasts) and non-hair cells (derived from atrichoblasts). These cells are arranged in sixteen or more discrete files. Each hair <b>cell</b> <b>file</b> overlies the anticlinal (radial) wall of the underlying cortical cells and is separated from the next by one or two non-hair files. The root hair forms as a tip-growing projection from the basal end of the trichoblast i. e. the end nearest the root meristem. The non-hair epidermal cells are significantly longer than the hair forming cells and are located over the outer periclinal (tangential) wall of the underlying cortical cells. The size difference between the two cell types is apparent in the cell division zone before hairs form. This suggests that the signals required for the differentiation of the root epidermis function in the meristem itself. Ectopic hairs are present in the ctr 1 root epidermis suggesting that a Raf protein kinase {{may play a role in}} pattern formation/differentiation in the root epidermis and that ethylene may be a diffusible signal involved in specifying pattern in the root epidermis...|$|E

40|$|The {{continuous}} development of roots {{is supported by}} a sustainable system for cell production and growth at the root tip. In the stem cell niche that consists of a quiescent centre and surrounding stem cells, an undifferentiated state and low mitotic activity are preserved by the action of auxin and abscisic acid. Stem cell daughters divide several times in the proximal meristem, where auxin and gibberellin mainly promote cell proliferation. Cells then elongate with the help of gibberellin, and become finally differentiated as a constituent of a <b>cell</b> <b>file</b> in the elongation/differentiation zone. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the transition zone is located between the proximal meristem and the elonga-tion/differentiation zone, and {{plays an important role in}} switching from mitosis to the endoreplication that causes DNA polyploidization. Recent studies have shown that cytokinins are essentially required for this transition by antagonizing auxin signalling and promoting degradation of mitotic regulators. In each root zone, different phytohormones interact with one another and coordinately control cell proliferation, cell elongation, cell differentiation, and endoreplication. Such hormonal networks maintain the elaborate structure of the root tip under various environmental conditions. In this review, we summarize and discuss key issues related to hormonal regulation of root growth, and describe how phytohormones are associated with the control of cell cycle machinery.

The genotypes include controls such as the drought sensitive IR 64 and Nipponbare, along with the drought resistant Nagina 22 (N 22) and Bengal landraces to identify distinguishing phenotypic features of resistant accessions. Anatomical traits studied include total areas of the cross-sections of the stele, cortex, aerenchyma, cortical-cell, and xylem tissue; the number of aerenchyma, xylem vessels, cortical <b>cell</b> <b>file</b> number and size that together describe a number of root phenes, or individual traits that can be analyzed genetically. To make paired comparisons in size using cross-section area the ratio of xylem to stele, stele to cortex, cortex to cross-section, stele to cross-section, cortical cell area to cortex, and aerenchyma to cortical cell area were calculated.

40|$|When stimulated to bend {{downward}} {{by being}} held at 45 degrees off vertical but unable to penetrate into agar-based media, Arabidopsis roots develop waving and looping growth patterns. Here, we demonstrate that ethylene modulates these responses. We determined that agar-containing plates sealed with low-porosity film generate abiotic ethylene concentrations of 0. 1 to 0. 3 μL L- 1, whereas in plates wrapped with porous tape, ethylene remains at trace levels. We demonstrate that exogenous ethylene at concentrations as low as a few nanoliters per liter modulates root waving, root growth direction, and looping but through partly different mechanisms. Nutrients and Suc modify the effects of ethylene on root waving. Thus, ethylene {{had little effect on}} temporal wave frequency when nutrients were omitted but reduced it significantly on nutrient-supplemented agar. Suc masked the ethylene response. Ethylene consistently suppressed the normal tendency for roots of Landsberg erecta to skew to the right as they grow against hard-agar surfaces and also generated righthanded petiole twisting. Furthermore, ethylene suppressed root looping, a gravity-dependent growth response that was enhanced by high nutrient and Suc availability. Our work demonstrates that <b>cell</b> <b>file</b> twisting is not essential for root waving or skewing to occur. Differential flank growth accounted for both the extreme root waving on zero-nutrient plates and for root skewing. Root twisting was nutrient-dependent and was thus strongly associated with the looping response.

Data were collected to test the theory at three levels of organization: the individual stoma; stomata distributed in one dimension, in linear fashion along cell files; and stomata apportioned in two dimensions, across the length and breadth of the leaf. In an attempt to watch the patterning process through regeneration, stomata in all visible stages of development were laser ablated. The results showed that the formation of stomata 1 initials was highly regular, and measurements of stomata 1 frequency and spacing showed that pattern was determined near the basal meristem when the stomata 1 initials arose. Following the origin of initials, the pattern was not readjusted by division of epidermal cells. Stomata 1 initials were not committed when first present and a small percentage of them arrested.

40|$|Quantification of {{the tissue}} and {{cellular}} structure of plant material {{is essential for the}} study of a variety of plant sciences applications. Currently, many methods for sectioning plant material are either low throughput or involve free-hand sectioning which requires a significant amount of practice. Here, we present an updated method to provide rapid and high-quality cross sections, primarily of root tissue but which can also be readily applied to other tissues such as leaves or stems. To increase the throughput of traditional agarose embedding and sectioning, custom designed 3 D printed molds were utilized to embed 5 – 15 roots in a block for sectioning in a single cut. A single fluorescent stain in combination with laser scanning confocal microscopy was used to obtain high quality images of thick sections. The provided CAD files allow production of the embedding molds described here from a number of online 3 D printing services. Although originally developed for roots, this method provides rapid, high quality cross sections of many plant tissue types, making it suitable for use in forward genetic screens for differences in specific cell structures or developmental changes. To demonstrate the utility of the technique, the two parent lines of the wheat (Triticum aestivum) Chinese Spring × Paragon doubled haploid mapping population were phenotyped for root anatomical differences.

30|$|Anatomical traits affect P {{efficiency}} via {{their effects}} on root metabolic cost, e.g. enhanced root cortical aerenchyma (RCA) formation reduces root respiration and the metabolic cost of soil exploration in maize subject to drought and low nitrogen (Zhu et al. 2010; Saengwilai et al. 2014). The functional-structural model SimRoot predicts that more RCA would improve P efficiency in maize, substantially improving growth and reducing critical P levels by 12  % (Postma and Lynch 2011). Despite the fact that rice has substantially greater RCA formation than maize, genotypic variation in rice RCA could affect metabolic cost by a similar mechanism. Increased specific root length, a phenomenon often observed under low nutrient treatments (Hill et al. 2006; Fernandez and Rubio 2015), is also predicted {{to reduce the cost}} of soil exploration (Chimungu and Lynch 2015). Changes in specific root length could be achieved by reduced secondary growth in dicots, or by various anatomical changes in monocots, such as fewer cortical cells or a smaller stele. Cortical <b>cell</b> <b>file</b> number, which is correlated with the number of cortical cells, has been shown to improve drought tolerance of maize by reducing root respiration, increasing rooting depth and thereby improving water capture (Chimungu et al. 2014). In rice, anatomical traits such as root diameter and xylem vessel size have previously been targeted for their potential to improve drought resistance (Clark et al. 2008; Henry et al. 2012), but could also contribute to root efficiency, i.e. P uptake per unit root size (Wissuwa 2005), under low P conditions.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe tested Charlton's {{hypothesis}} (1990) that stomata {{are present}} and patterned in linear cell aggregations using the monocot Tradescantia. We examined the following {{features of the}} leaf epidermis {{in support of this}} theory: linear groups (strings) of stomatal complexes and of epidermal cells were sought in immature and mature regions of entire leaves; the lengths (in cell number) and incidences (numerical occurrence) of both string types were determined; the uniformity and progression of stomatal differentiation within strings were studied; physical characteristics of differentiating strings within cell files were measured. Undifferentiated epidermal cells from the leaf base were stained with DAPI to reveal precursors of stomatal strings immediately proximal to the stomatal initial region. The results indicated that the Tradescantia epidermis in the leaf blade consists of linear groups of stomata and epidermal cells, which did not change in cell number nor incidence during development. The incidence of stomata by length was nonrandom. Although incidence decreased with string length, the decline was not linear nor exponential. Stomatal strings show cell cycle synchrony in DAPI staining of stomatal precursors and synchrony of stomatal differentiation within a string. The irregularity in the length of the stomatal development region, and each differentiation stage in it, by <b>cell</b> <b>file</b> was consistent with the variation in string length and unity in string development. The evidence supports Charlton's hypothesis that cells are patterned based on their position in the cell cycle and that linear groups of stomata reflect cell lineages, which maintain a degree of cell cycle synchrony...|$|E

The threshold method {{has been widely}} used in wood anatomy as well as wood density. Because {{of the presence of}} the intra-annual variation in tree-ring structure, however, the conventional threshold method needs adjustment in an objective and effective way. We suggest the analysis of the error zone method for this adjustment. The method was tested with 500 radial <b>cell</b> <b>files</b> of mature balsam fir, and showed its potential as an objective, robust and easily applicable adjustment tool...|$|R

Vascular tissues usually differentiate at predictable positions but {{the wide range}} of functional patterns generated in response to abnormal growth conditions or wounding reveals partially self-organizing patterning mechanisms. Signals ensuring aligned cell differentiation within vascular strands are crucial in self-organized vascular patterning, and the apical-basal flow of indole acetic acid has been suspected to act as an orienting signal in this process. Several recent advances appear to converge on a more precise definition of the role of auxin flow in vascular tissue patterning...|$|R
