40|$|Abstract—Electrical {{stimulation}} {{has been}} used for over 25 years to restore breathing to patients with high quadriplegia causing respiratory paralysis and patients with <b>central</b> <b>alveolar</b> <b>hypoventilation.</b> Three groups have developed electrical pacing systems for long-term support of respiration in humans. These systems consist of electrodes implanted on the phrenic nerves, connected by leads to a stimulator implanted under the skin, and powered and controlled from a battery-powered transmitter outside the body. The systems differ principally in the electrode design and stimulation waveform. Approximately 1, 000 people worldwide have received one of the three phrenic pacing devices, most with strongly positive results: reduced risk of tracheal problems and chronic infection, the ability to speak and smell more normally, reduced risk of accidental interruption of respiration, greate...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Sleep has a {{physiological}} influence on respiration, which can have major {{adverse effects on}} gas exchange in patients with respiratory insufficiency. These effects relate largely {{to a reduction in}} various stimulant inputs to the brain-stem respiratory centre. Conditions that may be associated with sleep-related res-piratory insufficiency range from pulmonary disorders (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)), to central respiratory insufficiency (such as <b>central</b> <b>alveolar</b> <b>hypoventilation),</b> neurological and neuromuscular disorders (such as polio and muscular dystrophy), and thoracic cage disorders (such as kyphoscoliosis). All these conditions have in common the finding of hypoxaemia and hypercapnia, which become more pronounced during sleep. The relative hypoventilation, which is common to each condition, is due to varying combinations of an inadequate res-piratory drive and an increase in the work of breathing. Management of respiratory insufficiency during sleep should be directed first at optimizing the underlying disorder, then at correcting hypoxaemia with con-trolled low-flow supplemental oxygen. Pharmacological therapy may be effectiv...|$|R
40|$|Three {{life-threatening}} respiratory complications {{are regularly}} encountered {{in patients who}} survive the initial insult from a diffuse brain stem lesion [...] <b>central</b> <b>alveolar</b> <b>hypoventilation,</b> upper airway obstruction, and aspiration pneumonitis. From treating 13 patients who did survive, a surgical plan for managing the respiratory sequelae of such injuries has evolved and consists of: 1) Diaphragm pacing to correct hypoventilation; 2) tracheostomy for bypass of the upper airway obstruction; 3) gastrostomy for bypass of the impaired structures of swallowing; 4) surgical closure of the larynx to prevent aspiration. All 13 patients manifested central apnea, which was controlled in five by bilateral phrenic nerve stimulation and in eight by unilateral stimulation. All patients required tracheostomy to provide an airway for artificial ventilation and for secretion removal. In ten patients aspiration necessitated gastrostomy. The spontaneous recovery {{of the ability to}} swallow allowed closure of the gastrostoma in three but in others aspiration remained a serious complication. One patient died of massive aspiration after discharge from the hospital. Three patients had surgical closure of the larynx to prevent aspiration. Seven patients are alive; six of them are leading productive lives, though several have severe disability due to paresis or ataxia. Six died after discharge from the hospital.

Though children with PHOX 2 B mutation-confirmed CCHS demonstrate ANS dysregulation, including altered heart rate and blood pressure control, it is unknown if adults with CCHS have similarly affected autonomic function in blood pressure control. Methods and Results An autonomic profile of blood pressure control has been studied with recording of muscle sympathetic activity and spectral analysis of heart rate and blood pressure variability of one adult patient with <b>alveolar</b> <b>hypoventilation</b> and the 20 / 25 PHOX 2 B genotype. All parameters of heart rate variability were reduced. Cardiac baroreflex sensitivity was decreased. Sympathetic responses to Valsalva maneuver, hypoxemia, isometric exercise and cold pressor were blunted. Conclusion In summary, we found a reduced cardiac baroreflex and a blunted sympathetic mediated response in the individual with adult-onset CCHS, possibly due to dysfunction in the afferent pathway. Our results confirm that PHOX 2 B affects the development of the autonomic nervous system, possibly causing absence of normal maturation of carotid body and visceral sensory ganglia and leading to autonomic dysfunction in adult-onset CCHS.

40|$|In {{patients}} with neuromuscular disorders (NMD) and thoracic wall deformities (TWD) <b>alveolar</b> <b>hypoventilation</b> can occur once the respiratory muscles become insufficient. Non-invasive ventilation can be started to reduce hypercapnia {{and to improve}} symptoms. Previous studies in {{patients with}} NMD and TWD showed an increased survival {{and quality of life}} after initiation of NIV. Although NIV is mostly applied to reduce <b>alveolar</b> <b>hypoventilation</b> during the night, only very few studies have searched for the effect of NIV on {{the quantity and quality of}} sleep. One of the most typical symptoms of <b>alveolar</b> <b>hypoventilation</b> is increased daytime sleepiness, which has a possible negative effect on physical activity. Few small studies (n< 10) have found positive effects of NIV on muscle strength and the 6 minute walking distance, but no research has been done on the effect of NIV on physical activity. In a first part we will search for the effects of NIV on the quantity and quality of sleep in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A large group of ALS patients is in follow-up at the Neuromuscular Reference Centre of the University Hospitals Leuven. If <b>alveolar</b> <b>hypoventilation</b> occurs, most of these patients are sent on to our sleep lab to initiate NIV. By using polysomnography (objective measurement) and patient reported outcomes (subjective measurement) the effect on quantity and quality of sleep is measured. Further on, research will be performed to investigate the influence of NIV on the sympathicovagal balance and an attempt will be made to create an “ideal” protocol for titration of NIV. A second part will focus on theeffects of NIV on physical activity in patients with NMD and TWD. Physical activity will be objectively measured before and after initiation ofNIV by physical activity devices together with the measurements of physical capacity and the endurance and strength of peripheral and respiratory muscles. nrpages: 182 status: publishe...|$|R

Both phenotypes present in the newborn period. Children with CCHS often have physiologic and anatomic manifestations of a generalized autonomic nervous system dysfunction/dysregulation (ANSD); a subset have altered development of neural crest-derived structures (i. e., Hirschsprung disease) and tumors of neural crest origin including neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroma, and ganglioneuroblastoma.

40|$|<b>Congenital</b> <b>Central</b> Hypoventilation Syndrome is {{a genetic}} disease {{characterized}} by <b>alveolar</b> <b>hypoventilation</b> and autonomic dysregulation. Patients have hypoventilations, especially during sleep, conditioning hypercapnia {{which can lead}} to neurological damage and death. They therefore need mechanical ventilators, that provide sufficient gas exchange, and pulse-oximeters that monitor oxy-hemoglobin blood concentration. Due to the restrictions regarding domiciliary assistive devices, the presence of a caregiver is required all night long. Currently, the only alarm systems available are the ones integrated in the ventilators and monitoring systems. During the night, multiple false alarms may occur, interrupting the sleep and causing anxiety. In this work we describe an assistive device that acquires real-time data from a pulse-oximeter, provides a multisensory stimulation if oxygen saturation falls under a certain threshold, and wakes up the patient if the hypoxia is severe. Tests on healthy subjects have shown that the device guarantees rapid awakenings, with a stimulator-dependent efficacy, and that it does not affect sleep efficiency. The purpose of the device is to determine a gentle awakening if mild hypoxia conditions persist, and to assure rapid awakening when a severe hypoxia occurs, reducing false alarms, improving the quality of sleep and increasing the self-sufficiency of the patients...|$|R

Nineteen patients {{admitted to the}} medical intensive care unit requiring mechanical ventilation and haemodialysis were enrolled. Arterial blood gas, white blood cell (WBC) count, minute ventilation, respiratory rate, breathing pattern and blood pressure were measured according to the following time schedule: pre-dialysis (time 0), and at 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240 min thereafter. Results showed that, {{with the use of}} cuprammonium dialyser, the WBC count dropped immediately and reached the nadir 15 min after haemodialysis. Thereafter, it recovered and overshot the pre-dialysis values until the end of dialysis. The bicarbonate dialysate indeed resulted in rapid and significant metabolic alkalosis. However, no decrease of PaO 2 occurred throughout haemodialysis. The tidal volume, minute ventilation and breathing pattern remained stable during haemodialysis.

Late-onset CCHS (LO-CCHS), which may be precipitated by severe respiratory infection or exposure to sedatives or general anesthesia, presents after the neonatal period. Since CCHS patients require lifelong mechanical-assisted ventilation, in western countries, diaphragm pacing is used to provide adequate alveolar ventilation and oxygenation during rest and daily activities. The main anesthesia-related concern regarding CCHS is postoperative respiratory failure or apnea, and anesthetic agents should be minimized to avoid further respiratory depression after surgery. A 5 -year-old girl with LO-CCHS was referred to our hospital for implantation of a phrenic nerve stimulator for diaphragm pacing. Respiratory infection triggered the need for permanent nocturnal ventilator support at age 3  years and tracheotomy was performed at age 4  years. Repeated self-dislodgement of the ventilator tube led to hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. The patient was thought to require mechanical ventilation under minimum sedation and pain management during the early postoperative period.
