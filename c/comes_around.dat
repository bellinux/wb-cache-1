5|$|Max and Steph become {{attracted}} to each other. Max plunges into grief and remorse for bringing estranged wife Clare Cunningham (Gemma Bissix) {{into the lives}} of the people he cares about. Steph feels sorry for him and invites him out. Max tries to kiss her. Steph and Max began to misread each other and, even as they developed feelings for each other, assume there is no chance at a relationship. When Max took Tom to the safari park to see an elephant named Romeo, that Steph had sponsored for him, Steph found him and they finally told each other that they liked each other and agreed to get into a relationship. Tom initially disapproves of their relationship, but <b>comes</b> <b>around</b> to the idea.|$|E

The descendants of Podukutty, the first Pattathu Ayya of Payyan dynasty, prepare this daily at the Pathi. Thavanaipal, a gruel prepared with rice and green gram, is distributed to the devotees.|$|E

25|$|The film {{goes back}} to several months before the opening scene, and Anne and her husband Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant), both retired piano {{teachers}} in their eighties, attend a performance by one of Anne's former pupils, Alexandre. They return home to find that someone has unsuccessfully tried to break into their apartment. The next morning while they are eating breakfast, Anne silently suffers a stroke. She sits in a catatonic state, not responding to Georges. She <b>comes</b> <b>around</b> as Georges {{is about to get}} help, but doesn't remember anything that took place. Georges thinks she was playing a prank on him. Anne is unable to pour herself a drink.|$|E
25|$|The Brazil women's {{national}} team {{is a successful}} women's football team, though not as successful as the men's counterpart. It was runner-up in the FIFA Women's World Cup of 2007, and a Silver Medal at the Olympic games in 2004 and 2008. In comparison, Argentina {{does not have a}} professional (or even semi-professional) women's football league; the members of the Argentina women's national football team are all amateur players despite their clubs often being affiliated with prominent men's professional clubs. Although the two teams usually have to battle for the top qualification spots for CONMEBOL when the World Cup qualification <b>comes</b> <b>around,</b> this rivalry does not provide the passion that men's matches encounter yet.|$|E
25|$|When Megan Reeves was kidnapped, Don {{pushed his}} ethics {{to the limit}} to get her back. While he did not {{personally}} beat a suspect, he had Special Agent Ian Edgerton interrogate the teenager for information on where Megan was being held. It is never shown or said what Edgerton did during the interrogation, but it is heavily implied {{that he may have}} used physical force, up to and including applying pressure to the gunshot wound through the teen's wrist; Don expressed concern to his father over being willing to go that far, even if he wasn't doing it himself. After this discussion, he convinced his father that it is good to have someone to come home to, and that is why he <b>comes</b> <b>around</b> the Craftsman house so often rather than staying at his apartment.|$|E

25|$|Planning their {{invasion}} of Yunkai, Daario tells Daenerys and her knights about a rear {{gate to the}} city, through which they can sneak in and open the main gate for her army. Ser Jorah is suspicious of Daario and his plan, but <b>comes</b> <b>around</b> when Daenerys seeks Grey Worm's opinion. When night falls, Daario, Jorah, and Grey Worm arrive at the gate. Daario enters ahead of them, posing as a still loyal Second Son commander. Shortly after being let inside the city, he signals Jorah and Grey Worm to follow him. Soon, they are ambushed {{by a group of}} Yunkai's slave soldiers, and though largely outnumbered, manage to kill them and accomplish the mission. The group returns to Daenerys, and tells her that she is now in control of the city.|$|E
25|$|Wetz's three symphonies are powerful, {{introverted}} {{works in}} the style of late romantic symphonic music being cultivated at the time, yet his works show their own distinct personalities separating them from the tradition. For Wetz, the subdued nature of the closing passages of his works confirm the integrity of these works. The first symphony's end, for instance, begins in the key of C minor (as Bruckner did also) and almost dissolves in a bright major key before, after a recall of earlier music, an austere and minor-mode conclusion not heard in any Bruckner finale (closer to the mood of the conclusions to some Bruckner opening movements) <b>comes</b> <b>around.</b> This was certainly influenced by the spirit of the times in which he lived, which were certainly not typical. His quartets follow the same techniques in form and gesture as his symphonies, but these were invested with substantially more intense feeling than the more public symphonies.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{starting}} his professional career in 1949–50, the Red Wings assigned Pronovost to the Omaha Knights of the United States Hockey League (USHL). He appeared in 69 {{games for the}} Knights and scored 13 goals and 52 points. Pronovost set a scoring record by a defenceman and was named the USHL's rookie of the year. He was also named to the First All-Star Team. [...] At 19 years of age, Pronovost was compared to legendary defenceman Eddie Shore and Detroit coach Jack Adams described him as being [...] "one {{of those guys who}} <b>comes</b> <b>around</b> once every 20 years".|$|E
500|$|McCartney's bass, {{placed in}} front of the mix, is an ingenious {{counterpoint}} that takes him all over the fretboard ... At the chorus, for example, while Lennon and McCartney harmonize in fourths on a melody with a slightly Middle Eastern tinge, McCartney first points up the song's droning character by hammering on a high G (approached with a quick slide from the F natural just below it), playing it steadily on the beat for twenty successive beats. [...] The next time the chorus <b>comes</b> <b>around,</b> though, he plays something entirely different, a slightly syncopated descending three-note pattern that almost seems to evoke the falling rain.|$|E
500|$|Ragan, who was {{the leader}} before the fifteenth caution, {{described}} his frustration after being black flagged by saying, [...] "It was tough to swallow.

We were sitting in position and just didn't do it. This thing only <b>comes</b> <b>around</b> once a year, so I'll think about it until we throw the checkered flag on next year's Daytona 500. So it's tough, but there is a bright side– we finished, we got some points and we ran up front, but we just didn't get what we come down here to do." ...|$|E

The town has 10 parks, with the Somasundaram Park at Panagal Road and Municipal Park at Thendral Nagar being the most prominent of them.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly positive, noting its ability to [...] "capture some of the appeal from the pre-cancellation days." [...] Ahsan Haque of IGN praised the episode's story, writing that it had [...] "a great storyline and the right {{combination}} of irrelevant and relevant jokes", giving the episode an 8.4 out of 10. In another positive review, Brett Love of TV Squad called the episode [...] "solid," [...] and praised the scenes set in 1984, and the alternate world. Love went on to state, [...] "The show has lost a little of the luster that it once had, but that's no reason to count them out. There were enough bright spots to give hope for a return to that old form when season six <b>comes</b> <b>around</b> in the fall." [...] He graded [...] "Meet the Quagmires" [...] 5 out of 7.|$|E
500|$|The {{requirement}} of the Federal Supreme Court that the apportionment of all state legislatures be by population is stated.

It also contains provisions for apportioning ten districts of the lower house. If it is deadlocked, the Chief Justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court will appoint an 11th and then the vote is by absolute majority. It was passed on election day, 1966, but was first applied on January 17, 2006. This was superseded in 1995 by Article II, Section II. [...] It took effect on December 7, 1978.

500|$|In [...] "The Set Up," [...] a new citywide {{effort is}} {{implemented}} to make government officials {{more accessible to}} Pawnee residents, an idea which Ron condemns as [...] "my hell." [...] As a result, he seeks to hire an assistant who will shield him from the public and allow him to continue doing nothing. After interviewing several candidates, he chooses April Ludgate, convinced her constant apathy and negative attitude will suit him perfectly. Their relationship proves very harmonious until the episode [...] "94 Meetings," [...] when April accidentally schedules nearly 93 meetings not counting one with her, on a single day. April previously kept {{people who wanted to}} meet with Ron away by scheduling them for a meeting on March31, a date she wrongly believed was nonexistent. When March31 actually <b>comes</b> <b>around,</b> Ron has to enroll help from others in the park department to handle the meetings. He becomes so furious with April that she quits, but Ron later apologizes and hires her back.|$|E

Amanat said, By the time this new launch <b>comes</b> <b>around,</b> it will have been almost two years since the premiere of Ms. Marvel—and boy, has Kamala Khan been through a lot since then. She's been slowly coming into her own, dealing with the challenges of navigating adulthood and being a super hero. But her training is over now and it's time for the big leagues; the question is can she handle it?... As much as Kamala has a right to be there—it's still a bit of a culture shock. Dreaming of being an Avenger and then suddenly being one is a lot to take on for someone of her age. So, she'll be a little awestruck, a little overly ambitious.|$|E

Roger and Jane go to the party, which is hosted by Jane's therapist and her husband. After dinner, Roger asks Jane if they can leave, but Jane reminds Roger that he agreed to take LSD with the group and begs him to stay, as she doesn't want to go through the experience alone. Roger is initially unimpressed with the drug but <b>comes</b> <b>around</b> after his consciousness begins to change with vivid audio-visual hallucinations. Roger and Jane return home via taxi and take a bath together, during which Roger imagines he is watching the 1919 World Series from the bathtub.

The next morning, a jovial Roger says goodbye to a shocked Jane, who appears regretful about what she said the night before.|$|E
