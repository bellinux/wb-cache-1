25|$|Although the {{histories}} of Native Hawaiians and Native Americans are significantly different, {{there is still a}} widely held perception that Native Hawaiians have received similar kinds of unfair treatment from the U.S. Government as Native Americans. The Apology Bill is thus seen as a means of acknowledging historical grievances that they believe are valid. Some also see it as a step towards identifying Native Hawaiians as an indigenous people to preserve for them specific legal rights based on ancestry; some also see it as the beginning of a process to provide <b>compensation</b> <b>or</b> <b>reparation</b> to native Hawaiians for alleged past injustices.|$|E
50|$|The Commission {{studied the}} riot for nearly six years, and {{produced}} a report after hearing from numerous sources and scholars. Representative Wright led the effort in the North Carolina General Assembly to gain legislation to correct the century-old damage {{with a kind of}} <b>compensation</b> <b>or</b> <b>reparation</b> for victims' descendants through economic development, scholarships and other programs. Wright introduced ten bills for this purpose {{at the start of the}} session. But, he became embroiled in a personal campaign finance scandal that Commission members feared endangered their work. Their bills were ignored by the legislature.|$|E

5000|$|The {{apprenticeship}} system was deeply unpopular with slaves. On 1 August 1834, as the Governor in Port of Spain, Trinidad addressed an audience {{about the new}} laws, the mostly elderly, unarmed slaves began chanting: [...] "Pas de six ans. Point de six ans" [...] ("Not six years. No six years"), drowning out his voice. Peaceful protests continued until the government passed a resolution to abolish apprenticeship and the slaves gained de facto freedom. Full emancipation for all slaves was legally granted on 1 August 1838, ahead of schedule, making Trinidad the first British slave society to fully end slavery. The government set aside £20 million for compensation of slave owners for their [...] "property" [...] across the Empire {{but it did not}} offer the former slaves <b>compensation</b> <b>or</b> <b>reparations.</b>|$|R
40|$|Maritime {{conflict}} management is {{the regulation of}} conflict {{in relation to the}} sea. It comprises conflict enforcement, conflict resolution and conflict avoidance. How did victims of maritime conflicts claim and obtain damages or demand <b>compensation</b> <b>or</b> <b>reparation?</b> The papers in this issue, aim to shed light on this question from two distinct yet related perspectives: that of the aggressor and the victim on the one hand, and that of the political entities to which they belonged on the other. The articles, covering seven centuries, unveil connections and entanglements between private parties and public authorities, demonstrating the importance of both for the development of maritime {{conflict management}}. Taken together these contributions provide evidence for the gradual development of maritime conflict management, diplomacy and norms for international law...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the cultural world-view known as Ubuntu which highlights the essential unity {{of humanity and}} {{emphasizes the importance of}} constantly referring to the principles of empathy, sharing and cooperation in our efforts to resolve our common problems. The discussion will focus on how Archbishop Desmond Tutu utilized the principles of Ubuntu during his leadership of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission. This study will also outline the five stages of the peacemaking process found among Ubuntu societies, including: acknowledgement of guilt, showing remorse and repenting, asking for and giving forgiveness, and paying <b>compensation</b> <b>or</b> <b>reparation</b> as a prelude to reconciliation. Potential lessons for peace and reconciliation efforts are highlighted with the premise that the Ubuntu approach to the building of human relationships can offer an example to the world...|$|E
40|$|Transitional {{societies}} {{must contend}} {{with a range of}} complex challenges as they seek {{to come to terms with}} and move beyond an immediate past saturated with mass murder, rape, torture, exploitation, disappearance, displacement, starvation, and all other manner of human suffering. Questions of justice figure prominently in these transitional moments, and they do so in a dual fashion that is at once backward and forward looking. Successor governments must think creatively about building institutions that bring justice to the past, while at the same time demonstrate a commitment that justice will form a bedrock of governance in the present and future. This is no easy task, and shortcuts, both in dealing with the past and in building a just future, often appear irresistible. In Martha Minow’s words, justice at this juncture amounts to replacing “violence with words and terror with fairness,” and steering a “path between too much memory and too much forgetting. ” The template of mechanisms available to undertake transitional justice are familiar to those who work in this field: prosecutions (domestic and international); truth and reconciliation commissions; lustration (the shaming and banning of perpetrators from public office); public access to police, military and other governmental records; public apology; public memorials; reburial of victims; <b>compensation</b> <b>or</b> <b>reparation</b> to victims and/or their families (in the form of money, land, or other resources); literary and historical writing; and blanket or individualized amnesty. In most cases, justice demands the deployment of a number of these tools, given that no one of them can adequately address and repair the injuries of the past nor chart a fully just future. Transitional justice will always be both incomplete and messy...|$|E
5000|$|At the Benedictine abbey of Charroux in La Marche on {{the borders}} of the Aquitaine [...] "a great crowd of many people (populus) {{gathered}} there from the Poitou, the Limousin, and neighboring regions. Many bodies of saints were also brought there" [...] bringing miracles in their wake. Three canons promulgated at Charroux, under the leadership of Gombald Archbishop of Bordeaux and Gascony, were signed by the bishops of Poitiers, Limoges, Périgueux, Saintes and Angoulême, all in the west of France beyond the limited jurisdiction of King Hugh Capet. Excommunication would be the punishment for attacking or robbing a church, for robbing peasants or the poor of farm animals - among which the donkey is mentioned, but not the horse (an item beyond the reach of a peasant) - and for robbing, striking or seizing a priest or any man of the clergy [...] "who is not bearing arms". Making <b>compensation</b> <b>or</b> <b>reparations</b> could circumvent the anathema of the Church.|$|R

5000|$|The word [...] "restitution" [...] {{was used}} in the earlier common law to denote the return or {{restoration}} of a specific thing or condition. In modern legal usage, its meaning has frequently been extended to include not only the restoration or giving back of something to its rightful owner and returning to the status quo but also <b>compensation,</b> reimbursement, indemnification, <b>or</b> <b>reparation</b> for benefits derived from, or for loss or injury caused to, another. In summary, therefore, the word [...] "restitution" [...] means the relinquishment of a benefit or the return of money or other property obtained through an improper means to the person from whom the property was taken.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I treat some leading rulings on {{compensation}} and reparation in the jurisprudence of international investment arbitrations, {{for the purpose}} of clarifying the trend of judgment upon the damage valuation criteria and methods. The recent discussion on the investment arbitration cases puts too much emphasis on various standards in substantive law, for example, expropriation, fair and equitable treatment obligation, most-favored-nation treatment obligation, and national treatment obligation. However, it is obviously the result of calculation of <b>compensation</b> <b>or</b> <b>reparation</b> that determines {{the success or failure of}} the investment arbitration system, and on such basis we have to evaluate whether or not the investment arbitrations perform effectively. In effect, many controversies on the substantive law, for example distinction between the expropriation and the fair and equitable treatment obligation, would eventually be transformed into the problem of whether their valuation criteria could differ or not. In this sense, the process of damages evaluation plays an important role in maintaining the balance of system in the international investment law as a whole. On the other hand, is it possible to derive generally applicable criteria for the ruling of compensation and reparation, while these are significantly influenced by particular circumstances of each case? In this regard, the following two points have been widely recognized as premises in the international investment law. In the first place, concerning expropriation measures, "reparation" amounts are normally larger than "compensation" amounts. Secondly, reparation costs more in cases of "expropriation" than that of "non-expropriation". It is the very purpose of this paper to re-examine these two premises. Firstly, while confirming the significance of the theoretical distinction between the notion of compensation and that of reparation, I point out that their valuation methods and results are identical in the practical point of view (Section I). Secondly, I am going to indicate that the recent jurisprudence does not follow the clear distinction between the expropriation case and non-expropriation one with regard to their calculation phases. I will conclude that the decisive factor for the classification of cases is whether or not there has been "a total loss" of investment assets (Section II). On the basis of the examination above, I derive finally some policy implications. ...|$|E
25|$|With {{the defeat}} of the Confederacy in 1865, the Reconstruction Era began. The United States {{abolished}} slavery without <b>compensation</b> to slaveholders <b>or</b> <b>reparations</b> to freedmen. A Republican Party coalition of black freedmen, northern carpetbaggers and local scalawags controlled state government for three years. The white conservative Democrats regained control of the state legislature in 1870, in part by Ku Klux Klan violence and terrorism at the polls, to suppress black voting. Republicans were elected to the governorship until 1876, when the Red Shirts, a paramilitary organization that arose in 1874 and was allied with the Democratic Party, helped suppress black voting. More than 150 black Americans were murdered in electoral violence in 1876.|$|R
