40|$|Abstract — The double-layer {{capacitor}} (DLC) is a {{low voltage}} device exhibiting an extremely high capacitance value in comparison with other capacitor technologies of similar physical size. It’s also a promising device for certain power electronic application as energy storage. In this work, a three RC branch equivalent circuit is used to characterize its terminal behavior and the equivalent circuits result are simulated using PSIM to provide the power electronics engineers {{a model for the}} terminal behavior of the DLC. Voltage dependent capacitor and schematic implementation of the double layer capacitor model using PSIM is also presented here. The simulated equivalent circuit response of a carbon-based DLC for power applications is found to be similar with the experimental results.

40|$|Aliasing, or sharing, is {{prominent}} in many domains, denoting that two differently-named objects {{are in fact}} identical: a change in one object (memory cell, <b>circuit</b> <b>terminal,</b> disk block) is instantly reflected in the other. Languages for modelling such domains should let the programmer explicitly define the sharing among objects or expressions. A DSL compiler may find other identical expressions and share them, implicitly. Such common subexpression elimination {{is crucial to the}} efficient implementation of DSLs. Sharing is tricky in embedded DSL, since host aliasing may correspond to copying of the underlying objects rather than their sharing. This tutorial summarizes discussions of implementing sharing in Haskell DSLs for automotive embedded systems and hardware description languages. The technique has since been used in a Haskell SAT solver and the DSL for music synthesis. We demonstrate the embedding in pure Haskell of a simple DSL with a language form for explicit sharing. The DSL also has implicit sharing, implemented via hash-consing. Explicit sharing greatly speeds up hash-consing. The seemingly imperative nature of hash-consing is hidden beneath a simple combinator language. The overall implementation remains pure functional and easy to reason about.

40|$|Abstract: An RF {{amplifier}} is {{an active}} network that increases the amplitude of weak signals, thereby allowing further processing by the receiver. Receiver amplification is distributed between RF and IF stages throughout the system, and an ideal amplifier increases the desired signal amplitude without adding distortion or noise. Unfortunately, amplifiers are known to add noise and distortion to the desired signal. In a receiver chain, the first amplifier after the antenna contributes most to the system noise figure. Adding gain {{in front of a}} noisy network reduces the noise contribution from that network. Amplifier Noise Figure To analyze the effect of circuit noise, one can model the noisy circuit as a noiseless circuit plus external noise sources. For a noisy, two-port network with internal noise sources (Figure 1 a), the effects of those sources are represented by the external noisevoltage sources Vn 1 and Vn 2, placed in series with the input and output terminals, respectively (Figure 1 b). Those sources must produce the same noise voltage at the <b>circuit</b> <b>terminals</b> as the internal noise sources. The values of Vn 1 and Vn 2 are calculated i...|$|R

40|$|A fast time-domain multiconductor {{transmission}} line (MTL) simulator for analyzing general MTL networks is presented. The simulator models the networks as homogeneous MTLs that are excited by external fields and driven/terminated/ connected by potentially nonlinear lumped circuitry. It hybridizes an MTL solver derived from time-domain integral equations (TDIEs) in unknown wave coefficients for each MTL with a circuit solver rooted in modified nodal analysis equations in unknown node voltages and voltage-source currents for each circuit. These two solvers are rigorously interfaced at MTL and <b>circuit</b> <b>terminals,</b> {{and the resulting}} coupled system of equations is solved simultaneously for all MTL and circuit unknowns at each time step. The proposed simulator is amenable to hybridization, is fast Fourier transform (FFT) -accelerated, and is highly accurate: 1) It can easily be hybridized with TDIE-based field solvers (in a fully rigorous mathematical framework) for performing electromagnetic interference and compatibility analysis on electrically large and complex structures loaded with MTL networks. 2) It is accelerated by an FFT algorithm that calculates temporal convolutions of time-domain MTL Green functions in only O(Ntlog 2 N t) rather than O(Ntt 2) operations, where N t {{is the number of}} time steps of simulation. Moreover, the algorithm, which operates on temporal samples of MTL Green functions, is indifferent to the method used to obtain them. 3) It approximates MTL voltages, currents, and wave coefficients, using high-order temporal basis functions.

40|$|Model order {{reduction}} {{techniques for}} linear systems {{with large numbers}} of terminals This paper addresses the well known difficulty of applying model order reduction (MOR) to linear circuits with a large number of input-output terminals. Traditional MOR techniques substitute the original large but sparse matrices used in the mathematical modeling of linear circuits by models that approximate the behavior of the <b>circuit</b> at its <b>terminals,</b> and use significantly smaller matrices. Unfortunately these small MOR matrices become dense as the number of terminals increases, thus canceling the benefits of size reduction. The paper introduces a model reduction technique suitable for <b>circuits</b> with numerous <b>terminals.</b> The technique exploits the correlation that almost always exists between circuit responses at different terminals. The correlation is rendered explicit through an SVD-based algorithm and the result is a substantial sparsification of the MOR matrices.
