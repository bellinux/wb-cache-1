50|$|R v Ron Engineering and Construction (Eastern) Ltd, of 1981 is {{the leading}} Supreme Court of Canada {{decision}} {{on the law of}} <b>tendering</b> <b>for</b> contracts.

40|$|Green Public Procurement (GPP) {{has been}} {{considered}} as an important policy instrument {{in the context of}} sustainable consumption and production. The state and progress of GPP has earlier been measured by questionnaires and interviews, both methods being based on the assessment by the purchaser, and questionnaires having low response rates. Recently, a new method was developed, analyzing the existence of environmental criteria in the <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>tenders.</b> However, the studies have dealt neither with the progress in GPP, nor the statistical evidence of differences between countries. Our aim was to analyze more thoroughly whether the differences in the proportions of 'green' <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>tenders</b> between the three Nordic countries, Denmark, Finland and Sweden, in 2003 and 2005 were real, and whether there had occurred any progress between the years concerned. The paper also presents the 'GPP-record' method, which enables more valid measurement of the environmental soundness of public purchasing. The statistical analyses were done using logit models with country, year and product group as the explanatory factors. It proved to be relevant {{to take into account the}} variation that occurred from the random existence of product groups in the samples of <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>tender.</b> There were less environmental criteria in the <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>tenders</b> in Finland than in Denmark and Sweden in 2003, but in 2005 no significant difference between Finland and Denmark was observed.

5000|$|Austria is {{committed}} to a digital radio future and {{a report by the}} regulators, the Austrian Communications Authority (KommAustria) and RTR-GmbH recommended DAB+ in Band III as the way forward. As planned, KommAustria completed a call for interest regarding DAB+ in August 2012. KommAustria intended to launch DAB+ by an open <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>tender</b> regarding the DAB+ network if enough parties showed believable and sustainable interest. A minimum limit of 12 possible programs (to fill one MUX coverage) was set. Unfortunately this limit was not reached as too few parties showed interest or failed to meet the criteria of the call for interest. Most remarkably, the public broadcaster ORF and the bigger players in the Austrian market did not show interest but strongly voiced their opposition against the launch of DAB+ in Austria. However, there is a group of broadcasters who are very outspoken in favour of DAB+, but the majority of radio stations remain unsure. The public broadcaster ORF has renewed its objection to any DAB+ plans. In the upcoming [...] "Digitalisation Concept" [...] which marks the authority’s official strategy and schedule for the digitalisation of broadcasting, KommAustria plans to elaborate on the technical details of a possible DAB+ network. There will be no further calls for interest but the possibility for a <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>tender</b> upon request. Nevertheless, a working group that was created in 2009 to consider the countries digital future is still at work. Its members are stakeholders from the Austrian radio market who represent opponents and proponents of digital radio. It consists of the regulatory authority, the public broadcaster ORF, the commercial and non-commercial broadcasters associations, the electronic industry and consumer associations. The group is constantly watching and evaluating the progress of digital radio in other European countries. The success of digital radio in Germany will affect whether Austria decides to implement DAB+.|$|E
