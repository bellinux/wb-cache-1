5|$|Syracuse University Ambulance, {{commonly}} referred to as SUA, is a SU Health Services-based student organization that responds to over 1,500 medical emergencies each year. Providing intermediate life support (ILS), rapid cardiac defibrillation, emergency and nonemergency transportation, and special event standby services, SUA operates two full-time transporting ambulances, a supervisor's fly car, and a MCI trailer for mass-casualty incidents. Additionally, SUA operates four transport vans for non-emergency transports. Advanced life support (ALS) mutual aid is provided by the City of Syracuse's private EMS provider, Rural/Metro Medical Services. SUA was formed in 1973 by a group of students out of a need for emergency medical services on campus. Starting with only a few members and meager equipment, the Syracuse University Medical <b>Crisis</b> <b>Unit</b> was formed. The organization has evolved greatly over time but, with 70+ volunteer students, remains a student-run organization to this day. SUA provides emergency and non-emergency services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week during the academic school year and is funded by a portion of the student health fee.|$|E
25|$|Patients with {{psychotic}} {{symptoms are}} common in psychiatric emergency service settings. The determination {{of the source of}} the psychosis can be difficult. Sometimes patients brought into the setting in a psychotic state have been disconnected from their previous treatment plan. While the psychiatric emergency service setting {{will not be able to}} provide long term care for these types of patients, it can exist to provide a brief respite and reconnect the patient to their case manager and/or reintroduce necessary psychiatric medication. A visit to a <b>crisis</b> <b>unit</b> by a patient suffering from a chronic mental disorder may also indicate the existence of an undiscovered precipitant, such as change in the lifestyle of the individual, or a shifting medical condition. These considerations can play a part in an improvement to an existing treatment plan.|$|E

50|$|The Mobile Crisis {{clinician}} has typically obtained her/his Master's {{degree in}} a mental health-related field (such as social work, mental health counseling, or counseling psychology). The clinician performs the evaluation based on standard models of mental status examination (alert and oriented, mood, thought process, affect, etc.), and assigns a DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association, Fifth Edition) diagnosis. After completing the evaluation, the clinician makes a disposition, or placement, decision for the client. Placements can include involuntary in-patient hospitalization, voluntary in-patient hospitalization, or discharge to home with out-patient referrals.

Shawkat, the brother-in-law of President Assad, was later shown to have survived, as well. In June 2012, the matter of Rajiha's alleged death was permanently resolved when it was confirmed that he remained Assad's defense minister in the newly formed cabinet.|$|E

The aim of the family <b>crisis</b> <b>unit</b> is to provide comfortable and family-friendly accommodation to families {{for a short period}} of time (initially 13 days), during which time staff work in a strengths-based way with families, encouraging them in their search for secure permanent accommodation. The family <b>crisis</b> <b>unit</b> is a home-like environment for families, providing each family with two bedrooms, and a shared kitchen, living, laundry and safe backyard play areas with one other family. Two large units provide this accommodation for a maximum of four families at any one time. One unit has a bathroom for each family, while in the other unit the two families share the bathroom. This unit is often provided to one large family, or to a two-parent family, rather than two families. Families contribute to the cost of staying at the family <b>crisis</b> <b>unit</b> by paying rent at a level negotiated with Wesley staff. As far as we know, the family <b>crisis</b> <b>unit</b> is the only service of its type in Victoria. Wesley has been extremely happy with the service provided to them by the landlord of the property.
