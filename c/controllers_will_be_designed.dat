A comparison between the experimental and simulated frequency responses indicates that the main uncertainty lies in the three parameters commonly perceived as being difficult to model in this application. Different approaches to parameterise the observed uncertainty are compared and evaluated. Based on an extended H ∞ loopshaping procedure, two degrees of freedom <b>controllers</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> using µ synthesis tools; one for a general coprime factor uncertainty description, the others for application tailored uncertainty parameterisations. The controllers are compared based on µ analysis and experimental results...|$|E
40|$|Conveyor {{belt system}} {{is one of}} the most common {{transfer}} system used in industry to transfer goods from one point to another in a limited distance. It is used in industries like the electro-mechanical/mechanical assembly manufacturing to transfer work piece from one station to another or one process to another in food industries. Belt conveyor system is also used in coal mining industries but a number of conveyor modules needs to be attached together to achieve long distance transfer. The belt conveyor system used in this project is driven by a DC motor and the model of the system will be determined using fundamental laws. The parameter of the model will then be estimated offline using System Identification toolbox in Matlab. For this reason, an open loop experiment will be done by injecting Sine Wave signal to the DC motor driver to obtain the experimental data for estimation process. This model is then used in Matlab for simulation purpose. In this project, two <b>controllers</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>designed.</b> The PID <b>controllers</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> to provide comparison to the main controller which is the Adaptive Fuzzy PID controller. Both controllers will be simulated in Matlab’s environment and will also be implemented on real hardware where the algorithm will be written in PLC using SCL language. Both simulation and experimental results shows that Adaptive Fuzzy PID controller performs better and adapted to the changes in load much faster than the PID controller. This project has also proved that PLC is capable of performing high level control system tasks...|$|E

The first thirty were dominated by relatively simple control devices- joysticks and D-Pads, as well as sporadic use of light guns and foot pad technology. We are entering an era where control will move beyond these simple implementations. Rather than being bound to the fingers and feet, full body movement is becoming ever more prevalent. While the aforementioned use of the fingers and feet isn't likely to fade out completely, {{the ways in which they}} manipulate the controllers will. Instead of dance pads alone, we will have pedals; instead of games being designed to fit the controllers, the <b>controllers</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> to fit the games, as we see in titles such as Guitar Hero and Dance Dance Revolution.

40|$|In {{the field}} of oil {{drilling}} there is a concept known as Managed Pressure Drilling. In Managed Pressure Drilling one relies on pumps in combination with chokes (valves) {{in order to maintain}} a certain pressure {{at the bottom of the}} well. It is crucial to maintain this pressure since too low pressure may cause the well to collapse and too high pressure may cause the well to fracture, making it more susceptible for a collapse. The pressure at the bottom of the well is mainly controlled by a choke. In this thesis controllers based on backstepping theory will be developed in order to control the choke pressure. The <b>controllers</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> such that the choke pressure will track a reference value and the controllers will achieve this by adjusting the choke's angular velocity. It is also common that certain parameters in the well are unknown due to changes that occur in the fluid running through the choke. Because of this, adaptive integrator backstepping controllers will also be developed. The goal for this project is to obtain an understanding of how well controllers based on integrator backstepping and adaptive integrator backstepping can solve this task. Integrator backstepping controllers are useful when designing controllers for systems on cascade form of order 2 or higher, however, the complexity of these controllers increases significantly as the order of the system increases. Because of this, two different design models have been used in this thesis in order to develop controllers based on integrator backstepping. One is of 2 nd order and the other is of 3 rd order. The 2 nd order design model describes how the pressure changes according to the flow in and out of the choke. The flow out of the choke depends on the choke opening and the choke opening changes based on the angular velocity of the choke. The 3 rd order design model is an extension of the 2 nd order design model. The 3 rd order model also describes the actuator dynamics in the choke which will provide a better representation on how the angular velocity affects the choke position. A controller was first developed for the 2 nd order system. If the controller behaved well, a new controller would be developed for the 3 rd order system. In order to verify the performance of the controllers, they were simulated in common scenarios that occur during drilling. Controllers that performed well during these simulations went through further testing by performing simulations with Straume, a high-end multiphase well simulator. Straume provides a better representation of a real life drilling scenario and serves as a benchmark for the controllers validation. In addition to the common scenarios, the simulations in Straume also cover how wrong parameterization of the often unknown parameters affects the controllers performance. A regular integrator backstepping controller was developed for the 2 nd order system. This controller performed well during the simulation and thus a controller for the 3 rd order system was developed. The 3 rd order controller also performed well during simulations. The adaptive controller developed for the 2 nd order system performed badly during simulations and a 3 rd order adaptive controller was not developed. The regular integrator backstepping controllers went through further testing by simulating them with Straume. Both controllers performed well, but both experienced a constant offset between the reference value and the choke pressure. The controllers also experienced a drop in performance when the parametrization of the bulk modulus did not match the bulk modulus in Straume. These controllers performed well enough for them to be used further as long as one is aware of their shortcomings...|$|E

40|$|Conventional Active Magnetic Bearings (AMB) are {{operated}} using a {{bias current}} (or flux) to achieve greater linearity and dynamic capability. Bias, however, results in undesirable rotating losses and consequent rotor heating. While control without bias flux {{is an attractive}} alternative, it is considerably more complex due to both force slew rate limitations and actuator nonlinearity. In this paper, optimal control of a magnetic bearing without bias is investigated. A single degree-of-freedom system consisting of a mass and two opposing electromagnets is considered. The optimal control problem is examined for a cost function that penalizes both poor regulation and rotational energy lost. Though a standard optimization procedure does not directly yield an analytical solution, it does show that the optimal control is always bang-bang including possibly a singular arc. First, the minimum time problem is solved for a simple switching law in three dimensional state space. A non-standard, physics-based approach is then employed to obtain an optimal solution for the general problem. The final result is an optimal variable structure feedback controller.

30|$|The dynamic output {{feedback}} {{technique is}} more flexible and the required {{conditions on the}} considered systems are less conservative. In addition, the proposed method is very efficient for the control design of the time-delay systems with nonlinear uncertainties, and the precise time-delays are not required for the control implementation [31]. Thus, with Assumption  1, the dynamic output feedback <b>controller</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> constructed for system (1). First, the virtual state feedback control law <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> based on adding a power integrator technique. Then, the nonlinear reduced-order compensators <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> to estimate the unmeasurable state of system (1). Moreover, based on the developed virtual state feedback control law and nonlinear reduced-order compensators, the dynamic output feedback controller is constructed to stabilize system (1) under arbitrary switchings. The detailed design process of the <b>controller</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> presented in Sect.  3.|$|R
