This was raked in York to clear the flue gases from the bridge, but was straight in Exeter owing to an altered bridge design and more extensive trunking. To maintain homogeneity of appearance, York stepped raked masts and Exeter vertical ones.

This {{was part of a larger}} research effort to eliminate crashes (and the resulting fatalities and injuries) between bicycles and motorized vehicles. The data collection process produced 1151 observations with approximately 40 different independent variables for each data point through direct observation, sensor logging, or derivation from other independent variables. Prior research by the authors developed a means to collect real-time field data through the use of a bicycle-mounted data collection system. The collected data was then used to model lateral <b>clearance</b> <b>distance</b> between vehicles and bicycles. The developed model confirmed field observations that the lateral <b>clearance</b> <b>distance</b> provided by drivers changes with vehicle speed and oncoming vehicle presence.

Evaluating roadways (or roadway designs) based on this model will enable stakeholders to identify those roadway segments where a paved shoulder would prove an effective safety countermeasure. This research will also enable roadway designers to better identify during the design phase those roadway segments that should be constructed with a paved shoulder...|$|E

40|$|The {{factors that}} affect the {{stability}} of the melt stream during the casting of wire directly from the melt have been investigated. It is shown that the criticality of process parameters centres mostly on the forces imposed on the melt stream at confluence with the cooling water. The analysis of these forces indicated that the shear component of the disturbance is dependent on the ratio of the velocity of the melt stream (vm) to that of the cooling water (vw) in accord with results obtained from previous experiments. The role of oxide-forming elements in widening the process parameters range is attributed to the increased stability of the melt stream due to the additional shear force resistance offered by the solid oxide layer. The roles of Cr and Si oxides in stabilising the melt stream are confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of wire indicating the presence of these oxides on fresh as-cast wires.

Together with new technologies involving higher casing conicity for improved compression rates, direct contact is now considered as part of aircraft engines normal life. In order to avoid possibly catastrophic scenarios due to high contact efforts between the rotating and static components, implementation of abradable coatings has been widely recognized as a robust solution offering several advantages: reducing potential damage to the incurring blade as well as adjusting operating clearances, in-situ, to accept physical contact events. Nevertheless, the process of wear undergone by abradable coatings is not well understood and its consequences are still under investigation. In the present work, its macroscopic behavior is numerically approximated through a piecewise linear plastic constitutive law which allows for real time access to the current abradable layer profile. First results prove convergence in time and space of the proposed approach and show that the frequency content of the blade response is clearly affected by the presence of abradable coatings.

40|$|This report {{details the}} {{development}} and demonstration of a collision control technology for P&H-class mining shovels that minimizes the frequency and severity of dipper collisions between the bucket, crawler tracks and floor. The work was funded by ACARP as project C 15038. The collision control technology uses a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework whereby control actions for preventing collisions, are chosen based on the predicted future behaviour of the shovel. The system predicts future locations of the dipper over a receding time horizon using a set of mathematical models that are driven by the operatorâ€™s joystick commands. The prediction models incorporate the shovelâ€™s electro-mechanical dynamics for hoist, crowd and swing motions. Predicted future bucket positions are tested for collisions using computational geometry algorithms on VRML models of the bucket, crawler tracks and floor. If a collision is predicted, the collision prevention algorithms calculate the minimum change to the operatorâ€™s command that will avoid the collision by a specified <b>clearance</b> <b>distance.</b> The altered joystick references are then passed to the P&H Centurion control system over the shovelâ€™s PROFIBUS control bus. The technology has been successfully demonstrated on the CRCMining P&H 2100 BLE research shovel at Bracalba Quarry in Queensland and on a P&H 4100 A at Caballo Mine in Wyoming USA.

40|$|Electromagnetic compliance, EMC, is an {{important}} aspect in todayâ€™s electronic design. Devices should not disturb other devices and also have to work in noisy environment. Tolerable interference emission levels are determined by standards. Electromagnetic interference, EMI, is a process, which involves an interference source, a coupling path and a receiver. Interferences from electronic devices are not only caused by noisy circuits like switching converters and high speed digital circuits, but also non-ideal components. Coupling methods can be divided on four categories: conductive, capacitive, inductive and radiated coupling. In printed circuit board (PCB) design, electromagnetic interferences can be affected with grounding component placement and routing. Proper PCB design decreases emissions from a device and also inside the device, {{but on the other}} hand poor PCB design may cause huge problems. Usually, all design principles canâ€™t be implemented and therefore compromises have to be done. Standards define creepage and <b>clearance</b> <b>distances</b> and hence set limitations also directly for PCB design. In PCB, one has to consider also, that manufacturability and design rules may vary for different subcontractors. Main theories of electromagnetic interference and principles of PCB design are examined through literature review in this thesis.

PCB designâ€™s effects on radio frequency interference (RFI) emissions are investigated experimentally using eight test PCBs and one reference PCB.
