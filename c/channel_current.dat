25|$|In {{the early}} {{development}} of many organisms, the action potential is actually initially carried by calcium current rather than sodium current. The {{opening and closing}} kinetics of calcium channels during development are slower {{than those of the}} voltage-gated sodium channels that will carry the action potential in the mature neurons. The longer opening times for the calcium channels can lead to action potentials that are considerably slower than those of mature neurons. Xenopus neurons initially have action potentials that take 60–90 ms. During development, this time decreases to 1 ms. There are two reasons for this drastic decrease. First, the inward current becomes primarily carried by sodium channels. Second, the delayed rectifier, a potassium <b>channel</b> <b>current,</b> increases to 3.5 times its initial strength.|$|E

40|$|Patch clamp {{recordings}} from embryonic mouse muscle {{cells in}} culture revealed spontaneous openings of the acetylcholine receptor channel {{in the absence}} of exogenously applied cholinergic agent. The conductance of the spontaneous <b>channel</b> <b>currents</b> was, within experimental error, identical with the conductance of suberyldicholine-activated <b>channel</b> <b>currents.</b> The comparison of channel conductance was made with sodium and with cesium, each at two concentrations, with the same result.

This chemical modification reduced the effectiveness with which suberyldicholine and curare activated <b>channel</b> <b>currents</b> but did not reduce the frequency of spontaneous openings. These experiments indicate that the acetylcholine receptor briefly and infrequently fluctuates into an active state {{in the absence of}} agonist.

40|$|The medial {{prefrontal cortex}} (PFC) is {{involved}} in cognitive functions, which undergo profound changes during adolescence. This alteration of the PFC function derives from neuron activity, which, in turn, may depend on age-dependent properties and the expression of neuronal ion channels. BK-type channels are involved in controlling both the Ca++ ion concentration in the cell interior and cell excitability. The {{purpose of this study}} was to test the properties of BK currents in the medial PFC pyramidal neurons of young (18 – 22 -day-old), adolescent (38 – 42 -day-old) and adult (58 – 62 -day-old) rats. Whole-cell currents evoked by depolarizing voltage steps were recorded from dispersed medial PFC pyramidal neurons. A selective BK channel blocker – paxilline (10 &# 181;M) – irreversibly decreased the non-inactivating K+ current in neurons that were isolated from the young and adult rats. This current was not significantly affected by paxilline in the neurons obtained from adolescent rats. The properties of single-channel K+ currents were recorded from the soma of dispersed medial PFC pyramidal neurons in the cell-attached configuration. Of the K+ <b>channel</b> <b>currents</b> that were recorded, ~ 90 % were BK and leak <b>channel</b> <b>currents.</b> The BK-type <b>channel</b> <b>currents</b> were dependent on the Ca++ concentration and the voltage and were inhibited by paxilline. The biophysical properties of the BK <b>channel</b> <b>currents</b> did not differ among the pyramidal neurons isolated from young, adolescent and adult rats. Among all of the recorded K+ <b>channel</b> <b>currents,</b> 38. 9 %, 12. 7 % and 21. 1 % were BK-type <b>channel</b> <b>currents</b> in the neurons isolated from the young, adolescent and adult rats, respectively.

2500|$|CACNB4 is a {{gene that}} encodes the calcium channel β subunit protein. [...] {{subunits}} are important regulators of calcium <b>channel</b> <b>current</b> amplitude, voltage dependence, and also regulate channel trafficking. The β4 isoform encoded by CACNB4 is most prevalent in the cerebellum. In mice, a naturally occurring null mutation leads to the [...] "lethargic" [...] phenotype, {{which is similar to}} JME. There are at least two mutations in the β4 subunit associated with JME, C104F and R482X. When wild-type α1A and β4 subunits are expressed in oocytes they produce large Ba2+ currents that inactivate slowly. Incorporation of either of the mutant β4 subunit into channels instead of wild-type subunits produces currents that are larger by 30-40%. The R482X mutation also increases the rate of fast inactivation of the channel. Since these effects are subtle, it is believed that they are contributory rather than completely causative for JME.|$|E

40|$|It is well {{established}} that neurons regulate the properties of both central and peripheral glial cells. Some of these neuro-glial interactions are modulated by the pattern of neuronal electrical activity. In the present work, we asked whether blocking the electrical activity of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in vitro by a chronic treatment with tetrodotoxin (TTX) would modulate {{the expression of the}} T-type Ca 2 + channel by mouse Schwann cells. When recorded in their culture medium, about one-half of the DRG neurons spontaneously fired action potentials (APs). Treatment for 4 days with 1 μM TTX abolished both spontaneous and evoked APs in DRG neurons and in parallel significantly reduced the percentage of Schwann cells expressing Ca 2 + <b>channel</b> <b>currents.</b> On the fraction of Schwann cells still expressing Ca 2 + <b>channel</b> <b>currents,</b> these currents had electrophysiological parameters (mean amplitude, mean inactivation time constant, steady-state inactivation curve) similar to those of control cultures. Co-treatment for 4 days with 1 μM TTX and 2 mM CPT-cAMP, a cAMP analogue that induces the expression de novo of Ca 2 + <b>channel</b> <b>currents</b> in Schwann cells deprived of neurons, maintained the percentage of Schwann cells expressing Ca 2 + <b>channel</b> <b>currents,</b> showing that TTX does not directly affect the expression of Ca 2 + <b>channel</b> <b>currents</b> by Schwann cell. We conclude that blocking spontaneous activity of DRG neurons in vitro downregulates Ca 2 + channel expression by Schwann cells.

40|$|Abstract Background Voltage-gated sodium {{channels}} {{play key}} roles in acute and chronic pain processing. The molecular, biophysical, and pharmacological properties of sodium <b>channel</b> <b>currents</b> have been extensively studied for peripheral nociceptors while {{the properties of}} sodium <b>channel</b> <b>currents</b> in dorsal horn spinal cord neurons remain incompletely understood. Thus far, investigations into the roles of sodium channel function in nociceptive signaling have primarily focused on recombinant channels or peripheral nociceptors. Here, we utilize recordings from lamina I/II neurons withdrawn {{from the surface of}} spinal cord slices to systematically determine the functional properties of sodium channels expressed within the superficial dorsal horn. Results Sodium <b>channel</b> <b>currents</b> within lamina I/II neurons exhibited relatively hyperpolarized voltage-dependent properties and fast kinetics of both inactivation and recovery from inactivation, enabling small changes in neuronal membrane potentials to have large effects on intrinsic excitability. By combining biophysical and pharmacological channel properties with quantitative real-time PCR results, we demonstrate that functional sodium <b>channel</b> <b>currents</b> within lamina I/II neurons are predominantly composed of the Na V 1. 2 and Na V 1. 3 isoforms. Conclusions Overall, lamina I/II neurons express a unique combination of functional sodium channels that are highly divergent from the sodium channel isoforms found within peripheral nociceptors, creating potentially complementary or distinct ion channel targets for future pain therapeutics. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{inhibitor}} cystine-knot motif {{identified in}} the structure of CSTX- 1 from Cupiennius salei venom suggests that this toxin may act as a blocker of ion channels. Whole-cell patch-clamp experiments performed on cockroach neurons revealed that CSTX- 1 produced a slow voltage-independent block of both mid/low- (M-LVA) and high-voltage-activated (HVA) insect Ca(v) channels. Since C. salei venom affects both insect as well as rodent species, we investigated whether Ca(v) <b>channel</b> <b>currents</b> of rat neurons are also inhibited by CSTX- 1. CSTX- 1 blocked rat neuronal L-type, but no other types of HVA Ca(v) channels, and failed to modulate LVA Ca(v) <b>channel</b> <b>currents.</b> Using neuroendocrine GH 3 and GH 4 cells, CSTX- 1 produced a rapid voltage-independent block of L-type Ca(v) <b>channel</b> <b>currents.</b> The concentration-response curve was biphasic in GH 4 neurons and the subnanomolar IC(50) values were at least 1000 -fold lower than in GH 3 cells. L-type Ca(v) <b>channel</b> <b>currents</b> of skeletal muscle myoballs and other voltage-gated ion currents of rat neurons, such as I(Na(v)) or I(K(v)) were not affected by CSTX- 1.
