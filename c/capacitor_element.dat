40|$|M. Ing. The {{drive for}} smaller and higher density power {{supplies}} have been realised by advances in switching technologies, higher frequencies and smaller components. Along with the advances of higher switching frequencies, came {{a number of}} restrictive parasitic effects that were insignificant at lower frequencies (in use a few years ago). A problem that is becoming of increasing concern, as the frequencies increase, rise times decrease and current levels increase, is the reactance of the parasitic inductance in voltage fed converter. This inductance is responsible for a multitude of limitations and problems in high frequency converters, with the most important being unstable voltage supplies, large voltage spikes during switching (which leads to electromagnetic interference), and power transfer limitations. The main contributors of this parasitic inductance {{was found to be}} the inherent inductance of the conductors of the DC bus, the internal inductance of the <b>capacitor</b> <b>elements</b> used in the DC bus and the paralleling of these <b>capacitor</b> <b>elements</b> (<b>capacitor</b> bank). It was decided to investigate the cause of these identified inductances in an attempt at finding a means to reduce them, thereby improving the performance of the converter. This was accompanied by a search into prediction methods for the inductance and capacitance of the DC bus conductors. The ability to predict the inductance and capacitance inherent to the DC bus conductors, will allow for a large decrease in prototyping, and should give insight into the causes of these elements and how to manipulate them. This was done for the DC bus conductors, and led to insight into their inductance and capacitance origins. Means to reduce this inductance was found, along with the ability to predict the inductance and capacitance of a number of DC bus conductors. The last two identified parasitic inductance sources, the internal inductance of the capacitors and inductance of the capacitor bank, were then investigated. The cause of the inductance in the <b>capacitor</b> <b>elements</b> was discovered, along with the factors on which the <b>capacitor</b> <b>elements</b> are dependent. A great deal of the inductance, and its associated effects, can be avoided through proper capacitor selection and correct capacitor bank design. In order to bring this study in context with a practical scenario, the information previously obtained was incorporated in a full bridge voltage fed converter. The previous findings on inductance and capacitance held equally well when applied to a practical scenario. Additional means to reduce the effects of the parasitic inductances were discovered, and the inductance and capacitance prediction methods proved to be relatively accurate when applied to the DC bus conductors of a physical converter...|$|R

Designs of capacitor units are evaluated by thermal stability tests to ensure thermal stability under overload conditions.

This thesis presents a multiphysics model of a HVDC Light capacitor unit simulating electric currents and heat transfer under the conditions of a thermal stability test. A capacitor unit consists of capacitor elements made of metallized films with large difference in scales. To overcome this, a multiscale approach {{have been used to}} model the capacitor unit. Effective properties and losses are computed on a small scale (several layers of metallized film) and utilized on a large scale (capacitor unit). The performed calculations yield the impedance of the capacitor unit corresponding to the rated impedance with the effective properties implemented. The loss computed on the small scale is lower than average measured loss of a <b>capacitor</b> <b>element.</b> Additionally, the loss computed on the large scale matches the average measured loss of a capacitor unit.
