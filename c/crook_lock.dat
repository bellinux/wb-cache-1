50|$|Also {{known as}} a <b>crook</b> <b>lock,</b> or club lock, the first {{generation}} of steering-wheel locks, known as canes, consisted of a lockable bar that connected the steering wheel to the brake pedal or clutch pedal. Later models include devices which are even more visible as they lock across the steering wheel and extend out over the dashboard to prevent the steering wheel being turned.|$|E

500|$|The Turk {{has also}} {{inspired}} works of literary fiction. In 1849, {{just a few}} years before the Turk was destroyed, Edgar Allan Poe published a tale [...] "Von Kempelen and His Discovery". Ambrose Bierce's short story [...] "Moxon's Master", published in 1909, is a morbid tale about a chess-playing automaton that resembles the Turk. In 1938, John Dickson Carr published The <b>Crooked</b> Hinge, a <b>locked</b> room mystery in his line of Dr. Gideon Fell detective novels. Among the puzzles presented included an automaton that operates {{in a way that is}} unexplainable to the characters. Gene Wolfe's 1977 science fiction short story [...] "The Marvellous Brass Chessplaying Automaton" [...] also features a device very similar to the Turk. Robert Loehr's 2007 novel [...] "The Chess Machine" [...] (published in the UK as [...] "The Secrets of the Chess Machine") focusses on the man inside the machine. F. Gwynplaine MacIntyre's 2007 story [...] "The Clockwork Horror" [...] reconstructs Edgar Allan Poe's original encounter with MÃ¤lzel's chess-player, and also establishes (from contemporary advertisements in a Richmond newspaper) precisely when and where this encounter took place.|$|R
