The main decision however only deals with the obligation on the party or parties concerned to bear <b>costs</b> (<b>apportionment),</b> whereas the actual amounts to be paid by one party to another are dealt with in another decision, namely a decision on the award (fixing) of costs. A decision on the award of costs is taken only after a decision apportioning the costs has been taken and if a request is submitted to that effect.

40|$|This article {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the thoughts of an Italian academic who lived {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century, Lorenzo De Minico, in particular it regards his approach to the allocation of common costs. De Minico's main concern was with the conventional, subjective allocation methods proposed by Italian practitioners and academics of his time. He valiantly searched for a methodological approach based on using causality as the basis for linking costs to cost objects. The most interesting finding of De Minico was the concept of ‘flows of services’ and his commitment to offering a convincing answer to the problem of general or common <b>cost</b> <b>apportionment</b> that went beyond ‘traditional’ criteria. De Minico's ‘flows of services’ referred to the outputs of resources consumed in indirect services. These indirect costs can be considered easily ‘directly attributable’ only if it is possible to measure the connected ‘flows of services’. The article shows that the concept developed by De Minico in early twentieth century of Italy confirms the idea that some theoretical frameworks for a causal allocation of common costs were in existence many decades before information technology made such systems a practical proposition...|$|E
40|$|Power and {{desalination}} cogeneration {{plants are}} common in many water scared courtiers. Designers and planners for cogeneration face tough challenges in deciding the options:- Is it better to operate a power plant (PP) with the reverse osmosis (i. e., PP+RO) or the thermally-driven multi-effect distillation/multi-stage flashed (PP+MED/MSF) methods. From literature, the RO methods {{are known to be}} energy efficient whilst the MED/MSF are known to have excellent thermodynamic synergies as only low pressure and temperature steam are used. Not with-standing the challenges of severe feed seawater of the Gulf, such as the frequent harmful algae blooms (HABs) and high silt contents, this presentation presents a quantitative analyses using the exergy and energetic approaches in evaluating the performances of a real cogeneration plant that was recently proposed {{in the eastern part of}} Saudi Arabia. We demonstrate that the process choice of PP+RO versus PP+MED depends on the inherent efficiencies of individual process method which is closely related to innovative process design. In this connection, a method of primary fuel <b>cost</b> <b>apportionment</b> for a co-generation plant with a MED desalination is presented.

40|$|Research PaperThis paper {{outlines}} {{the process and}} impact of a phased introduction of cost recovery on the Victorian wild and aquaculture sectors and the framework for tracking and delivering data outputs to a co-management fisheries management structure. In order to determine whether efficient and effective {{development and use of}} fisheries resources is occurring, all costs associated with these activities must be identified and appropriately apportioned. An integral part of these costs include Fisheries Management Services (FMS) usually delivered by publicly funded Fisheries Management Agencies (FMA’s). FMS refers to a range of services provided by a FMA that supports the management of public (wild resources) and private (aquaculture) fisheries resources. FMS are best assessed on an activity basis (activity based <b>costing)</b> with the <b>apportionment</b> of <b>costs</b> associated with these services based upon estimated costs and benefits to particular beneficiary groups. Fisheries Victoria has developed a computerised logging and data management system. The community’s interest (including intergenerational concerns) must be met by state stewardship. Being a public good, the FMS costs associated with this responsibility should be fully funded from the tax base. On the other hand, costs associated with FMS that directly benefit private entities for private gain are being recovered by FMA’s around the world to varying degrees of sophistication and degree. The recovery of these costs are usually in the form of levies or fees on licence holders. The economic costs associated with the increases in fisheries management levies are {{in the form of a}} short-term increase in enterprise costs and decreased returns. Concurrent with these impacts is the restructuring of fishing sectors as industry adjustment processes takes place...|$|R
40|$|The energy, {{water and}} {{environment}} nexus {{is a crucial}} factor when considering the future development of desalination plants or industry in the water-stressed economies. New generation of desalination processes or plants has to meet the stringent environment discharge requirements and yet the industry remains highly energy efficient and sustainable when producing good potable water. Water sources, either brackish or seawater, have become more contaminated as feed while the demand for desalination capacities increase around the world. One immediate solution for energy efficiency improvement comes from the hybridization of the proven desalination processes to the newer processes of desalination: For example, {{the integration of the}} available thermally-driven to adsorption desalination (AD) cycles where significant thermodynamic synergy can be attained when cycles are combined. For these hybrid cycles, a quantum improvement in energy efficiency as well as in increase in water production can be expected. The advent of MED with AD cycles, or simply called the MEDAD cycles, is one such example where seawater desalination can be pursued and operated in cogeneration with the electricity production plants: The hybrid desalination cycles utilize only the low exergy bled-steam at low temperatures, complemented with waste exhaust or renewable solar thermal heat at temperatures between 60 and 80. °C. In this paper, the authors have reported their pioneered research on aspects of AD and related hybrid MEDAD cycles, both at theoretical models and experimental pilots. Using the cogeneration of electricity and desalination concept, the authors examined the <b>cost</b> <b>apportionment</b> of fuel cost by the quality or exergy of working steam for such cogeneration configurations...|$|E
40|$|The three {{chapters}} of this dissertation investigate three vastly different questions, bound {{together by the}} tools of economic analysis used to answer each. Chapter 1 is a theoretical model that looks at the behavior of rational agents engaged in a risky activity, and how this behavior is affected by legal rules. Chapter 2 is an empirical look at a question that has only become important {{with the advent of}} internet technology, namely the effectiveness of online classes relative to the traditional classroom setting. Finally, Chapter 3 examines the behavior of corporations in response to changes in the statutory corporate tax rate. The first chapter examines the efficiency of different accident cost allocation rules, arriving at two important results. Firstly, for a general class of accidents, comparative negligence can induce individuals to take efficient levels of precaution despite evidentiary uncertainty. Drawing on this result, the chapter finds that given the correct <b>cost</b> <b>apportionment</b> rule some uncertainty is welfare improving as it induces efficient precaution and provides proper incentives for individuals to internalize a portion of the social cost of repeated engagement in the activity. Using a proprietary data set, Chapter 2 examines the difference in standardized test outcomes of students enrolled in synchronous online classes relative to their counterparts who take traditional in-person classes. The paper finds that students enrolled in traditional classes on average out-scored their online counterparts by approximately 13 points on the Graduate Management Aptitude Test. To control for possible selection bias, the paper finds that in-person class students outperform online students by between 28 and 45 points using IV and endogenous switching regression estimation. Chapter 3 exploits variation in statutory tax rates for the 1986 fiscal tax year to investigate the extent to which firms engage in intertemporal income shifting for tax purposes. Using financial statement data, the paper compares the income deferral activity of firms with July through November fiscal year ends to those of other firms in the COMPUSTAT panel of firms, finding very little evidence that firms that faced an anticipated rate drop in 1986 were more likely to defer income in 1985...|$|E
40|$|The {{treatment}} of financial services under the VAT {{has been one}} of the most contentious VAT issues since the origin of the VAT. Due to theoretical and measurement complexities, most countries opt to exempt financial services under the VAT. Exemption is the cause of all the controversy. Exempting supplies under the VAT compromises one of the corner-stones of the VAT – neutrality. South Africa is one of many countries that exempts most financial services under VAT. Credit card suppliers in South Africa offer a bundle of financial services comprising fee-based-charges and interest earned. The credit card user is usually only charged for the interest. Interest is an exempt supply under VAT. This gives rise to many distortions for South African credit card users and financial intermediaries. Exhaustive research has been conducted on the {{treatment of}} financial services under the VAT around the world. This study only focusses on the VAT treatment of interest margins of credit cards in South Africa. Firstly, it was determined that credit card offerings in South Africa include bundled offerings which is impractical to separate on a transaction-for-for transaction-basis due to valuation complexities and market conditions. Secondly, it was determined that VAT doesn’t play a major role in credit card suppliers’ decision on how offerings are structured. It is mostly guided by the competition and legislation. Thirdly, it was determined that administrative burden and compliance <b>cost</b> caused by <b>apportionment</b> in South Africa is highly underplayed in the literature. Lastly, it was proposed that full taxation of all financial services with implicit charges at a lower rate or full taxation of fee-based charges with exemption of financial services with a partial input recovery, to be the best alternatives for South Africa to consider to tax financial services under VAT.
