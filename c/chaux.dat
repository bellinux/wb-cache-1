In his initial draft for the House of Pleasure in <b>Chaux</b> (a proposed ideal city, near the Forest of <b>Chaux),</b> Ledoux drew upon allegorical ideas in his design with the union of man and woman, a physiological interpretation of intercourse and penetration.

2500|$|In Salins-les-Bains or in Montmorot, the saltworks' boilers {{were built}} {{close to the}} wells, and the wood was brought from the {{adjacent}} forests. Contrary to what the French government wanted, Ledoux placed the saltworks near the woods {{as opposed to the}} source of the salt water. He logically reasoned that {{it would be easier to}} transport water than wood. Close to the first of these sites, the Fermiers Généraux decided to explore a more mechanized and efficient method of extraction, by constructing a purpose-built factory near the forest of <b>Chaux,</b> in the Val d'Amour. [...] The saline water was to be brought to the factory by a newly constructed canal.|$|E
2500|$|The design, which {{received}} royal approval, of the Royal Saltworks at Arc-et-Senans, or Salines de <b>Chaux,</b> is considered Ledoux's masterpiece. [...] The initial building work was conceived {{as the first}} phase of a large and grandiose scheme for a new ideal city. [...] The first (and, as things were to turn out, only) stage of building was constructed between 1775 and 1778. Entrance is through a massive Doric portico, inspired by the temples at Paestum. [...] The alliance of the columns is an archetypal motif of neoclassicism. Inside, a cavernous hall gives the impression of entering an actual salt mine, decorated with concrete ornamentation representing the elementary forces of nature and the organizing genius of Man, a reflection of the views of the relationship between civilization and nature endorsed by such eighteenth-century philosophers as Jean-Jacques Rousseau.|$|E

2500|$|Claude-Nicolas Ledoux (21 March 1736– 18 November 1806) {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} exponents of French Neoclassical architecture. He used his knowledge of architectural theory to design not only domestic architecture but also town planning; as a consequence of his visionary plan for the Ideal City of <b>Chaux,</b> he became known as a utopian. His greatest works were funded by the French monarchy and came to be perceived as symbols of the Ancien Régime rather than Utopia. The French Revolution hampered his career; much of his work was destroyed in the nineteenth century. In 1804, he published a collection of his designs under the title L'Architecture considérée sous le rapport de l'art, des mœurs et de la législation (Architecture considered in relation to art, morals, and legislation). In this book he took the opportunity of revising his earlier designs, making them more rigorously neoclassical and up to date. This revision has distorted an accurate assessment of his role in the evolution of Neoclassical architecture. His most ambitious work was the uncompleted Royal Saltworks at Arc-et-Senans, an idealistic and visionary town showing many examples of architecture parlante. [...] Conversely his works and commissions also included the more mundane and everyday architecture such as approximately sixty elaborate tollgates around Paris in the Wall of the General Tax Farm.|$|E
