5|$|Massive {{numbers of}} workers were needed, the Vichy regime imposed a <b>compulsory</b> <b>labour</b> system, {{drafting}} some 600,000 French workers to construct these permanent fortifications along the Dutch, Belgian, and French coasts facing the English Channel. Efficiency of the OT decreased in late 1943 and 1944 {{as a result}} of manpower pressures, fuel shortages and the bombing of worksites, such as V-weapons sites, where some volunteer workers refused to work in such dangerous areas.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Waldmann {{applied for}} a career as {{an officer in the}} Luftwaffe for the first time. Travelling to Berlin, he was deemed {{suitable}} but at the age of 16 was too young to volunteer for military service. After the outbreak of World War II, while still at school, Waldmann and his fellow students were forced into <b>compulsory</b> <b>labour</b> service (Reichsarbeitsdienst). Waldmann was assigned to the Brunswick Mechanical Engineering Institute. Since Waldmann had intended to study aircraft construction after his military service, he was reassigned to the Institute of Aeronautical Metrology and Flight Meteorology at the Braunschweig-Waggum airfield under the leadership of Prof. Dr. Heinrich Koppe.|$|E
5|$|Müncheberg, who was talented {{in sports}} and athletics, played {{football}} for the T.V. Falkenburg youth team in the early 1930s. He attended the Sturmabteilung-sports school in Hammerstein {{for a few weeks}} in 1934 and in 1935 spent his summer vacation in Bulgaria where he, among other places, stayed at the Rila Monastery. In early 1936 he attended a National Socialism course in Lauenburg, Pomerania. He completed his <b>compulsory</b> <b>labour</b> service (Reichsarbeitsdienst) in October 1936 with Abteilung (department) 5/50 in Lüttmannshagen, district of Cammin. As an athlete, he especially excelled in the decathlon; almost daily he practised the ten different disciplines. Aged 17, he attended a summer camp held in conjunction with the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin.|$|E

50|$|Ironically, {{another factor}} in Labour's defeat was the {{popularity}} of National's universal superannuation scheme compared to <b>Labour's</b> <b>compulsory</b> savings programme. Universal superannuation, which replaced Labour's scheme, was to cause major financial headaches for subsequent governments.|$|R
5|$|From {{the outset}} of his posting, Clarke {{had to deal with}} issues {{regarding}} land and labour. The latter was of major significance at this time in Southern Rhodesia. In response to questioning by the African Association and the Manchester Society for the Protection of Native Races, Chamberlain in 1898 responded that forced labour was not permitted. A year later, Chamberlain was concerned by a chief native commissioner instructing chiefs at an indaba that it was their duty to supply labour. Clarke's subsequent report accused officials of the administration of requisitioning labour by 'pressure only short of force', causing 'discontent amongst the natives'. Clarke's view was that a mutually beneficial relationship between capital and labour was possible through market forces alone, without additional pressure. Chamberlain agreed, although Milner was in favour of <b>compulsory</b> <b>labour</b> even to the extent of 'recommending the corvée'.|$|E
5|$|Germany's {{war in the}} East {{was based}} on Hitler's long-standing view that Jews were the great enemy of the German people and that Lebensraum was needed for Germany's expansion. Hitler focused his {{attention}} on Eastern Europe, aiming to defeat Poland, the Soviet Union and remove or kill the resident Jews and Slavs in the process. After the occupation of Poland, all Jews living in the General Government were confined to ghettos {{and those who were}} physically fit were required to perform <b>compulsory</b> <b>labour.</b> In 1941, Hitler decided to destroy the Polish nation completely and planned that within 10 to 20 years the section of Poland under German occupation would be cleared of ethnic Poles and resettled by German colonists. About 3.8 to 4 million Poles would remain as slaves, part of a slave labour force of 14 million the Nazis intended to create using citizens of conquered nations in the East.|$|E
25|$|A German {{lawyer and}} {{prominent}} Nazi, Hans Frank, was appointed Governor-General of the General Government on 26 October 1939.

25|$|In June 1998 the International Labour Conference {{adopted a}} Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and its {{follow-up}} that obligates {{member states to}} respect, promote and realize freedom of association {{and the right to}} collective bargaining, the elimination of all forms of forced or <b>compulsory</b> <b>labour,</b> the effective abolition of child labour, and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.|$|E
25|$|Because of this {{overvaluation}} of German currency, the occupiers {{were able}} to make seemingly fair and honest requisitions and purchases while, in effect, operating a system of organized plunder. Prices soared, leading to widespread food shortages and malnutrition, particularly among children, the elderly, and members of the working class engaged in physical labour. Labour shortages also plagued the French economy because hundreds of thousands of French workers were requisitioned and transferred to Germany for <b>compulsory</b> <b>labour</b> under the Service du Travail Obligatoire (STO).|$|E
25|$|In 1943, the {{organization}} was administratively incorporated into Albert Speer's Ministry of Armaments and War Production. Speer's concerns, {{in the context of}} an increasingly desperate Germany in which all production had been severely impacted by materials and manpower shortages and by Allied bombing, ranged over almost the whole of the German war-time economy. Speer managed to increase production significantly, at the cost of a vastly increased reliance on <b>compulsory</b> <b>labour.</b> This applied as well to the labour force of the OT.|$|E
50|$|A {{consequence}} of the National Socialist rise to power in 1933 was Greiner's enforced membership in the Hitler Youth (Hitlerjugend). After {{four years in the}} organisation Greiner took an interest in aviation and joined the Flying Hitler Youth (Flieger Hitlerjugend), which was absorbed into the German Air Sports Association (Deutscher Luftsportscharen), in 1937. Here, Greiner passed the aptitude tests for a career as an officer in the Luftwaffe. All aspiring officers had to complete the Abitur. On 5 April 1938 he achieved the Abitur and then undertook six months of <b>compulsory</b> Reich <b>Labour</b> Service (Reichsarbeitsdienst).|$|R
50|$|Muir's term of {{confinement}} at {{the penal}} colony {{appears to have}} been fairly uneventful. As political prisoners, and men of talent and education, he and his associates were accorded far greater freedom of movement than ordinary convicts. Prior to their departure from Portsmouth each had received a considerable sum of money raised as a subscription on their behalf among the wealthy London Whigs. By this means they were able to sustain themselves without recourse to the official colonial stores, and thereby keep free of the <b>compulsory</b> manual <b>labour</b> normally demanded from all dependents.|$|R

25|$|The huge {{increase}} in the demand for labour created by the Westwall and many other projects was met {{by a series of}} expansions of the laws on compulsory service, which ultimately obligated all Germans to arbitrarily-determined (i.e. effectively unlimited) <b>compulsory</b> <b>labour</b> for the state: Zwangsarbeit. Between 1938 and 1940, 1.75 million Germans were conscripted into labour service. Both the Organisation Todt and the Labour Service were characteristically paramilitary in hierarchy and appearance, with elaborate sets of chevrons, armbands and epaulettes, and other insignia for the display and recognition of rank. Much larger numbers of Prisoners of war and other forced labourers were employed as more Germans were conscripted into the regular army.|$|E
25|$|The {{second period}} lasted from 1938, when the Organisation Todt group proper was founded, until February 1942, when Todt {{died in a}} plane crash. Following the {{invasion}} of Poland Todt was named the Minister for Armaments and Munitions in 1940 (Reichminister für Bewaffnung und Munition) and the projects of the OT group became almost exclusively military. The huge increase in the demand for labour created by the various military and paramilitary projects was met by a series of expansions of the laws on compulsory service, which ultimately obligated all Germans to arbitrarily determined (i.e., effectively unlimited) <b>compulsory</b> <b>labour</b> for the state: Zwangsarbeit. From 1938–40, over 1.75 million Germans were conscripted into labour service. From 1940–42, Organization Todt began its reliance on Gastarbeitnehmer (guest workers), Militärinternierte (military internees), Zivilarbeiter (civilian workers), Ostarbeiter (Eastern workers) and Hilfswillige ("volunteer") POW workers.|$|E
25|$|Black discontent {{had been}} growing {{in the rural areas}} largely because of the {{disruptive}} impact of the 1951 Land Husbandry Act. It was designed to enforce private ownership of land and improve the rural economy in the African reserves, which experienced the pressure of a growing population within fixed areas. However, its provisions violated traditional practices. Rather than expand the size of the reserves, the act limited cattle grazing in specified areas and provided for the de-stocking of African herds; it allowed officials to dictate patterns of cultivation and crop growing and to fix dwelling sites on farm land; it prohibited cultivating or grazing without a permit and imposed <b>compulsory</b> <b>labour</b> on unemployed rural Africans. Implementation of the act meant the depletion of highly valued herds, reduction of the land under cultivation, and the forced uprooting of families and entire villages. Discontent with socioeconomic conditions was growing among urban Africans as well. A recession in 1957–1958 hit blacks hard; rising unemployment and inadequate township housing contributed to their sense of deprivation and provided ready-made issues for ANC organizers.|$|E

25|$|Born Sybille Overhoff on 3 July 1926 to Edith née Kloeppel, her German mother, and Julius Overhoff, her Austrian father, {{she was one}} of five {{siblings}} {{including her}} twin sister Elfriede Knauer, an archaeologist. She grew up in a cultured family in Berlin, Frankfurt and Austria but her schooling was interrupted by the Nazi regime. She had to join Nazi youth organisations and spent a year doing <b>compulsory</b> <b>labour</b> in harsh conditions. After the war things remained difficult for some time and she studied Chinese while waiting for Frankfurt University to reopen in 1947. However, she had always been interested in the antiquities collected by her maternal great-grandfather, the sculptor and art historian , and had a long-standing wish to study classical archaeology, and in particular, Etruscology. Once at the Goethe University Frankfurt she studied classical archaeology, ancient history, art history and ethnology and found vacation work in museums in Paris, Rome, and London before graduating summa cum laude in December 1950. She went on to write a thesis on Etruscan bronze mirrors, supervised and encouraged by Guido von Kaschnitz.|$|E
500|$|It {{was only}} {{as late as}} December 1917 that a War Cabinet Committee on Manpower was established, and the British {{government}} refrained from introducing <b>compulsory</b> <b>labour</b> direction (though 388 men were moved {{as part of the}} voluntary National Service Scheme). Belgian refugees became workers, though they were often seen as [...] "job stealers". Likewise, the use of Irish workers, because they were exempt from conscription, was another source of resentment. Worried {{about the impact of the}} dilution of labour caused by bringing external groups into the main labour pool, workers in some areas turned to strike action.|$|E
500|$|Too {{small to}} form their own {{parliamentary}} group, the African deputies were compelled to join {{one of the larger}} parties in order to sit together in the Palais Bourbon. Thus, the RDA soon joined the French Communist Party (PCF) as the only openly anti-colonialist political faction and soon organised strikes and boycotts of European imports. Houphouët-Boigny justified the alliance because it seemed, at the time, to be the only way for his voice to be heard: [...] "Even before the creation of RDA, the alliance had served our cause: in March 1946, the abolition of <b>compulsory</b> <b>labour</b> was adopted unanimously, without a vote, thanks to our tactical alliance." ...|$|E

I am quite ready to admit that no system of voluntary Labour Exchanges can deal adequately with the evils and difficulties of casual labour; but there is one conclusive reason against <b>compulsory</b> <b>Labour</b> Exchanges at the present time. To establish a system of <b>compulsory</b> <b>Labour</b> Exchanges in order to eliminate casual labour, and so to divide among a certain proportion of workers all available employment, would be absolutely and totally to cast out at the other end a surplus of unemployed: and to do this before preparations have been made for dealing with that surplus, would be to court an administrative breakdown which could not fail to be attended with the gravest possible disaster. Until poor law reform has made further progress, to establish a compulsory system of Labour Exchanges would only increase and not diminish the miseries with which we are seeking to cope.|$|E
