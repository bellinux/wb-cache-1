We developed a thermodynamic network based on the most reliable and fundamental data in the arsenic system, using the most direct pathways to build the network, and checking for internal consistency at each step. Arsenolite, As 2 O 3 -cubic, is the cornerstone or anchor of the network from which thermodynamic properties of the aqueous species of arsenate and arsenite and their hydrolysis products are derived. Thermodynamic data on aqueous arsenate ions are essential for the evaluation of metal arsenate minerals and their solubilities. Very few measurements of metal arsenate and metal arsenite complexes are reported from the literature but by using a consistent chemical model and the same equation of state, several metal arsenate and metal arsenite complexes have been estimated by Marini and Accornero (2007, Environ. Geol. 52, 1343).

Figure  8 i shows the XANES taken from the emerald green pigment (reference sample, black), an As–Cu rich particle in the paint sample (layer 6, magenta), the iron-containing ground layer (layer 3, green), the copper rich layer (layers 9 – 10, red), and the varnish (layer 15 – 16 blue). The white line of the emerald green pigment is found at 11, 871.8  eV, but the As–Cu rich particle has peaks at both 11, 871.9 and 11, 875.2  eV. The first peak in the XANES of the As–Cu particle matches the white line of the emerald green reference and is interpreted as an intact emerald green pigment particle. As the XANES represents {{the bulk of the}} paint sample (no thin section was made), we expect that the white line at 11, 875.2  eV originates from the degradation product of the emerald green surrounding the particle. The iron-containing ground as well as the copper-containing layers both have white lines at 11, 875.4  eV, while the white line of the varnish lies at 11, 875.7  eV. The main arsenic species in The Descent of the Cattle sample is As 5 +, an arsenate. The slight difference in the position of the white line is thought to be caused by different counter-ions. Lead is the dominating cation present in the varnish and can act as a counter ion forming lead arsenates [1]. Iron arsenates {{are most likely to be}} formed in the iron layer, but lead arsenates cannot be excluded. Besides copper, the copper-containing layer also has lead, calcium, and potassium, so presumably lead and/or <b>calcium</b> <b>arsenates</b> are present.

40|$|International audienceArsenic (As) {{is a major}} {{pollutant}} in many {{mine tailings}} resulting from base metal and gold deposits. It can potentially cause environmental risks because of its high toxicity at low concentrations. A new tailings' management technique has become popular in new mines, the cemented paste backfill (CPB). It consists of mixing tailings with water (typically 25 %) and a low proportion of hydraulic binder (3 - 7 %) to produce a paste that {{can be stored in}} underground mine openings. Even if CPB is mainly used for improving mining techniques and for tailings storage purposes, it could also provide environmental advantages by stabilizing contaminants such as As. In the present study, X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) investigations were conducted on CPB samples synthesized in the laboratory and spiked with As. XAFS analysis were also performed on a variety of As-bearing compounds (natural or synthetic), to provide a database of reference XAFS spectra. Among these reference samples, calcium-silicate-hydrates (C-S-H) spiked with various amounts of As through adsorption and co-precipitation were synthesized. The nature and amounts of the As species in the CPB samples, as well as As valence state were determined by linear combination of the reference spectra, in a least squares fitting procedure. As speciation in C-S-H was determined by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fitting using theoretical curves from ab initio calculations. The results indicate that the binders promote the oxidation of As(III) to As(V) in the CPB. The As species formed in CPB are composed mainly of <b>calcium</b> <b>arsenates,</b> but other secondary minerals such as ferric arsenate can be present. Moreover, the use of fly ash binder could promote the formation of calcium-iron arsenates.

40|$|The {{increased}} use of biomass and recovered waste fuels in favor of fossil fuels for heat and power production {{is an important step}} towards a sustainable future. Combustion of waste fuels also offers several advantages over traditional landfilling, such as substantial volume reduction, detoxification of pathological wastes, and reduction of toxic leaches and greenhouse gas (methane) formation from landfills. However, combustion of recovered waste fuels emits more harmful trace elements than combustion of other fuels. These elements are distributed between bottom ash, fly ash and flue gas, depending on the elements partitioning and enrichment behavior. Volatilized harmful trace elements are mainly enriched in the submicron fly ash fraction. If emitted to the atmosphere, submicron particles can penetrate deep into the alveoli of the lungs, causing severe impacts on human health. Consequently, to reduce ash related problems and to control the emissions to the atmosphere, there is an increased need for understanding the physicochemical processes involved in ash transformation, including particle formation. The objective of this thesis was to carefully and systematically study the fate of trace elements during combustion, i. e. the chemical form of the elements and the partitioning behavior, by means of chemical equilibrium model calculations, X-ray diffraction, microscopy techniques and various spectroscopy methods. The influence of some fuel additives was also analyzed. Primarily, the elements copper, chromium and arsenic were studied. An initial review and evaluation of the content of thermodynamical data in commercial thermochemical databases used for chemical equilibrium model calculations showed that {{there was a significant difference}} in number of included phases and species between databases. Thermodynamical data also differed between databases, although in general less for condensed phases than for gaseous species. A state-of-the-art database for Cu, Cr and As was compiled and used for further chemical equilibrium model calculations. The fate of Cu, Cr and As was determined in combustion experiments on wood impregnated with copper, chromium and arsenic (CCA) in a bench scale reactor (15 kW). The results showed that global chemical equilibrium model calculations predicted the overall fate of Cu, Cr and As in bottom ash and ash particles quite well. However, compared to the experimental results the global model overpredicted the formation of refractory <b>calcium</b> <b>arsenates,</b> thus the arsenic volatilization was found to be higher then the predicted volatilization. In terms of chromium volatility, copper was found to be an important refractory element forming stable CuCrO 2 (s) and CuCr 2 O 4 (s) that suppressed the formation of CrO 2 (OH) 2 (g). The retention and speciation of Cu, Cr and As in bottom ash was further determined from combustion experiments of CCA wood fuel particles in a single particle reactor. Local chemical equilibrium model calculations were performed to simulate the combustion stages of a burning CCA treated wood fuel particle: drying, devolatilization, char burning and post-combustion. The results from the work showed that a mix of global and local chemical equilibrium model calculations is needed to describe the reality and that the combustion stages are partially overlapping. The fate of harmful trace elements, including Cu, Cr and As, was finally studied in full scale (65 MW) combustion experiments. Particles from the raw flue gas emissions were sampled and analyzed. The comparison with chemical equilibrium model calculations showed that the model explained the results well, but due to lack of thermodynamic data for K 2 ZnCl 4 (s), the formation of this phase could not be predicted...|$|R
40|$|In natural environments, arsenic {{chemistry}} {{is dominated by}} the reactions of its two predominant soluble forms, arsenate and arsenite. To predict the fate of As in the environment, it is necessary to consider processes that act to restrict its mobility. The mobility of As is strongly influenced by adsorption reactions to particle surfaces. Arsenate and arsenite may form surface complexes with a number of different oxides, including Fe-, Al-, Mn- and Ti oxides. The focus of this chapter is on the adsorption of As(III) and As(V) to the surfaces of oxides, in particular Fe oxides. We have analysed the existing data for arsenite and arsenate adsorption to ferrihydrite and goethite. Spectroscopic results show that arsenate forms bidentate binuclear complexes under all conditions; for arsenite, evidence has been found both for a bidentate binuclear complex and for a weaker outer-sphere complex, which may be of some importance at low ionic strength. We optimized As adsorption parameters for two surface complexation models, the diffuse double-layer model (DLM) and the three-plane CD-MUSIC model (TPCD), taking into account the spectroscopic evidence. For arsenate adsorption to ferrihydrite, the new DLM constants imply stronger binding than the previous compilation by Dzombak and Morel (1990), whereas for arsenite the revised DLM constants are in reasonable agreement. The surface complexation models could not be optimized satisfactorily for data sets in which the dissolved arsenite concentration at equilibrium was larger than 10 mM; the reasons for this are discussed. Simulations of competition effects show that o-phosphate competes strongly with arsenate over the whole pH range. Silicic acid and carbonate are important competitors in the circumneutral pH range, while sulphate may have a small competitive effect at low pH. Humic substances are important competitors when {{a large part of the}} Fe oxides is covered with humic substances.

40|$|This {{research}} {{dealt with}} the leaching of arsenic containing waste rocks from a proposed gold mine site at Reefton, New Zealand. Then it established the acidity and concentrations of Fe, sulfate, As(V) and As(III) released {{as a result of}} leaching experiments which simulated the weathering process. It also determined the arsenic concentrations that were released from old mine workings into the Devils Creek sediments catchment and concentrated into sediments. The Devils Creek catchment is located downstream from the proposed mine. Acid mine drainage (AMD) results from oxidation of sulfide bearing rocks and deposits (e. g. FeS and FeS 2). It is characterised by elevated concentrations of sulphate and iron and low pH. As(V) and As(III) may also be a component in AMD from the oxidation of FeAsS. Biologically As(III) is considered the more toxic form. Methods were developed for the measurement of arsenic species (As(V) and As(III)) in leachates derived from mine waste rocks. These were applied to freshwater samples and sediment extracts. These included: • A field method for the on-site fractionation of arsenic in fresh waters using XAD- 4 and Chelex-Fe(III) resins. In this two-step process the XAD- 4 resin was used to isolate and pre-concentrate natural organic matter (NOM) and therefore the arsenic fraction associated with it through iron bound to the NOM. In the second step Fe(III) modified Chelex 100 resin was used to selectively preconcentrate As(V) from water samples. Thus the combined method achieved discrimination between free and bound fractions of As(V) and the separation of As(V) from As(IU). • A flow injection analysis protocol based on spectrophotometric detection was modified to increase its sensitivity for measurement of arsenic species in leachates derived from waste rocks. The method was effective for the determination of arsenate. Arsenite was measured by prior oxidation with iodate. Study on the Devils Creek catchment established the existing baseline levels of arsenic in the fresh water and sediments. The water contains high levels of arsenic. Most of the arsenic in Devils Creek water is soluble. As(V) is the predominant species of which a minor fraction (13 - 28 %) is bound to NOM. It was also established that arsenic was associated with Fe and A 1 rich phases in the Devils Creek sediments. Due to the high accumulated arsenic load in the sediments, further uptake of arsenic from the water column is no longer viable because potential binding sites in the sediments have been saturated. Leaching simulation on mine basic waste rocks (GB 13) and an acidic sandstone were conducted using a variety of leach ants applicable to the field, then quantifying the Fe, As(III), As(V), heavy metals and acidity in the leachates. It was established that the sandstone rock had the greater potential to produce acid mine drainage (AMD). Its leachates give a high acidity (pH 2. 9 - 3. 4) compared to leachates of the GB 13 waste rock which have a weakly basic pH of 7. 2. The dominant arsenic species in leachates of both rock types is As(V). The concentrations of arsenic, soluble Fe and heavy metals leached from the sandstone were greater than those leached from GB 13. The interactions of arsenate with other components of AMD and natural organic matter were examined. It was established that ferrihydrite semi-quantitatively and rapidly removes arsenate from solution. The arsenate adsorption is inhibited by competing ions in the following order: sulfate> FA ≡ HA. Complexes of HA-Fe(III) and FA-Fe(III) bind arsenate as 1 : 1 complexes through the Fe(III). Investigations were made on the use of limestone for the control of arsenic in mine waste rock leachates. It was established that where acidic leachate contacts limestone the pH rises as a result of neutralisation reactions. Subsequently there is a precipitation of Fe(III) and retention of As(V) on the Fe(OH) 3. As (III) is oxidised by Fe 3 +(aq) and Fe(OH) 3. On contact with the limestone surface, As (III) is also retained and oxidised. Fe(III) impurities in the limestone are responsible for the uptake of both As(V) and As(III).

Arsenic and Ni {{concentrations in the}} tailings showed similar patterns with depth, which were strongly related to historical changes in As and Ni concentrations in the mill feed. Mineralogy of the ore bodies indicated that As and Ni in the mill feed occurred primarily as 1 : 1 molar ratio arsenides such as niccolite and gersdorffite. SEM analysis suggested that solubilized arsenic is precipitated as Ca, Fe and Ni arsenates during the neutralization process. Dissolved arsenic concentrations in rive monitoring wells installed within the tailing body ranged from 9. 6 to 71 mg/L. Sequential extraction analyses of tailings samples showed that As above 34 in depth was primarily associated with amorphous iron and metal hydroxides while the As below 34 m depth was primarily amorphous <b>calcium</b> <b>arsenate</b> precipitates. The high Ca/As ratio during tailings neutralization would likely preferentially precipitate Ca 4 (OH) 2 (AsO 4) 2 : 4 H 2 O. Geochemical modeling suggested that the pore fluid <b>calcium</b> <b>arsenate</b> equilibrium As concentrations would range between 13 and 81 mg/L. The predicted pH and speciation of arsenic in the filter sand was dependent on the redox conditions (oxidizing or reducing) assigned to the regional groundwater. Reducing conditions in the regional groundwater cause As, the dominant species in the tailings, to be reduced to As 34 as arsenic diffuses from the tailings into the filter sand. Under reducing conditions, iron as Fe 2 + in the filter sand is oxidized to Fe 3 + as the sulphate (S 6 +) present in the tailings diffuses into the filter sand and is reduced to sulphide (S 2). The pH in the tailings will decrease as the high concentrations of protons (lower pH) in the filter sand diffuse into the tailings. As the solubility of <b>calcium</b> <b>arsenate</b> minerals present in the tailings are pH dependent, the decrease in pH in the tailings causes an increase in solubility of the <b>calcium</b> <b>arsenate</b> minerals resulting in the dissolution of <b>calcium</b> <b>arsenate</b> minerals...|$|E
40|$|Losses of bees by {{poisoning}} {{have been}} greatly increased {{in recent years}} by the growing practice of applying insecticidal and fungicidal sprays to fruit trees. Preliminary laboratory tests showed that, of the common constituents of spray mixtures, only lead arsenate and flowers of sulphur were likely to cause serious honeybee poisoning, though Derris emulsion may cause slight poisoning. Syrup containing lime sulphur, nicotine sulphate, or copper sulphate was strongly repellent to the bees. It seemed possible that spray mixtures might be made repellent to the honeybee by the addition of suitable substances. Further trials showed that lead arsenate solution, at least in the concentrations normally used, was no more attractive to the bee than distilled water. Concentrations of 1 / 500 lime sulphur or 1 / 2000 nicotine sulphate were sufficient to reduce the uptake of M/ 1 sucrose to less than 10 % of that of unadulterated sucrose solution, and very much lower concentrations appreciably affected the uptake. The presence of lead arsenate in these solutions seemed to make them even more repellent. The repellent effect was reduced, though not entirely destroyed, when the solutions were evaporated to dryness and taken up in distilled water again. Creosote (0. 13 %), which has been suggested as a possible repellent, gave erratic results under laboratory conditions, and, in view of the danger of phytocidal action it is probably unwise to attempt to use its repellent property. Open flowers of apple trees were sprayed with various spray mixtures in an orchard experiment, and counts of bees showed both lime sulphur (1 %) and nicotine sulphate (0. 05 % nicotine) to have retained their repellent value for at least 7 days, in spite of heavy rain. If bees can thus be deterred from visiting the open blossom, {{it should be possible to}} deter them even more thoroughly from collection of water contaminated by sprays applied at the correct time. Data collected throughout the country during the last 3 years show <b>calcium</b> or lead <b>arsenate</b> to be the constituent of orchard sprays causing honeybee poisoning. Bees may collect arsenic when visiting fruit trees, or plants growing beneath or near the trees, for pollen or water, contaminated water apparently being the chief cause of poisoning; about 0. 00005 mg. internal arsenic per bee has been found to be a lethal dose. When arsenical sprays alone are applied to trees, particularly if to the open blossom as is sometimes the case with gooseberries and cherries, severe poisoning from the pollen may be expected. On the other hand, much of the danger from contaminated water should be removed by the incorporation of lime sulphur (1 % or more) or nicotine sulphate (0. 05 % nicotine) into sprays intended for application either before flowering or after petal fall, provided that alternative sources of water are available for foraging bees.

40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of johnbaumite, ideally Ca 5 (AsO 4) 3 OH, was determined and refined using crystals from the Harstigen mine, Värmland, Sweden, {{on the basis}} of X-ray diffraction data. The structure was refined to R 1 = 0. 038 in space group P 63 /m, with unit-cell parameters a = 9. 7242 (2), c = 6. 9657 (9) Å, and V = 570. 43 (2) Å 3. The chemical composition of the sample, determined by electronmicroprobe analysis, is (Ca 5. 02 Pb 0. 03) Σ 5. 05 [As 2. 91 P 0. 04 Si 0. 02]Σ 2. 97 O 12 (OH 0. 97 Cl 0. 03). Johnbaumite belongs to the <b>calcium</b> <b>arsenate</b> apatites, together with svabite, Ca 5 (AsO 4) 3 F, and turneaureite, Ca 5 (AsO 4) 3 Cl. Johnbaumite is topologically similar to {{the other members of the}} apatite supergroup: columns of face-sharing M 1 polyhedra run along c and are connected through TO 4 tetrahedra, giving rise to a zeolite-like microporous framework, with channels hosting M 2 cations and X anions. This is the first published single-{{crystal structure}} study of johnbaumite and the first report of this <b>calcium</b> <b>arsenate</b> apatite from the Harstigen mine. Actually, johnbaumite was identified at this locality at the end of the 19 th Century but it was described as svabite...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The <b>calcium</b> <b>arsenate</b> waste, {{containing}} {{amounts of}} arsenic (7. 62 wt%), was treated using solidification/stabilization technology (S/S) with geopolymer. In order {{to optimize the}} procedure for S/S, 9 different S/S samples, differing in amount of the geopolymer materials were prepared. On these samples, extraction tests were performed, showing that the arsenic concentration in the leachate was less than the China countermeasure standard (5 mg/l) after 28 days of curing when a geopolymer (GP) dosages more than 30 wt%. Furthermore, the samples showed substantially decreasing leachability with curing times. But there was no appreciable change in leachability under various time and pH conditions...|$|E
40|$|Two {{different}} {{members of}} lead <b>calcium</b> <b>arsenate</b> series of apatite group from Nezilovo are found. According to the chemical formula (calculated {{on the basis}} of 10 cations), infra red absorption powder spectra, X-ray powder patterns and unit cell dimensions these are two distinct members of one mineral species. Unit cell dimensions are a= 10. 157 (3), c= 7. 256 (6) and a= 10. 154 (2), c= 7. 191 (3) A. The first sample has Pb:Ca ratio 7. 35 : 2. 59 and the second one 6. 54 : 3. 45, what is closer to ideal hedyphane formula (6 : 4) ...|$|E
40|$|Three methodologies {{to assess}} As {{bioaccessibility}} were evaluated using playgroundsoil collected from 16 playgrounds in Madrid, Spain: two (Simplified Bioaccessibility Extraction Test: SBET, and hydrochloric acid-extraction: HCl) assess gastric-only bioaccessibility {{and the third}} (Physiologically Based Extraction Test: PBET) evaluates mouth–gastric–intestinal bioaccessibility. Aqua regia-extractable (pseudo total) As contents, which are routinely employed in riskassessments, were used as the reference to establish the following percentages of bioaccessibility: SBET – 63. 1; HCl – 51. 8; PBET – 41. 6, the highest values associated with the gastric-only extractions. For Madridplaygroundsoils – characterised by a very uniform, weakly alkaline pH, and low Fe oxide and organic matter contents – the statistical analysis of the results indicates that, in contrast with other studies, {{the highest percentage of}} As in the samples was bound to carbonates and/or present as <b>calcium</b> <b>arsenate.</b> As opposed to the As bound to Fe oxides, this As is readily released in the gastric environment as the carbonate matrix is decomposed and <b>calcium</b> <b>arsenate</b> is dissolved, but some of it is subsequently sequestered in unavailable forms as the pH is raised to 5. 5 to mimic intestinal conditions. The HCl extraction {{can be used as a}} simple and reliable (i. e. low residual standard error) proxy for the more expensive, time consuming, and error-prone PBET methodology. The HCl method would essentially halve the estimate of carcinogenic risk for children playing in Madridplaygroundsoils, providing a more representative value of associated risk than the pseudo-total concentrations used at presen...|$|E
40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of conichalcite [calcium copper(II) arsenate(V) hydroxide], with ideal formula CaCu(AsO 4) (OH), was redetermined from a natural twinned specimen {{found in the}} Maria Catalina mine (Chile). In contrast to the previous refinement from photographic data [Qurashi & Barnes (1963 ▶). Can. Mineral. 7, 561 – 577], all atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement parameters and with the H atom located. Conichalcite belongs to the adelite mineral group. The Jahn–Teller-distorted [CuO 6] octa­hedra share edges, forming chains running parallel to [010]. These chains are cross-linked by eight-coordinate Ca atoms and by sharing vertices with isolated AsO 4 tetra­hedra. Of five <b>calcium</b> <b>arsenate</b> minerals in the adelite group, the [MO 6] (M = Cu, Zn, Co, Ni and Mg) octa­hedron in conichalcite is the most distorted, and the donor–acceptor O—H⋯O distance is the shortest...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{preparation}} of <b>calcium</b> <b>arsenate</b> is given {{with a view to}} reducing it to the arsenide, this {{to be used in the}} formation of arsine. The analysis includes moisture, carbonate, chloride, arsenic and calcium. The second section of the thesis deals with an electrolytic preparation of arsine. A literature survey shows previous work along this line but only on very small amounts of arsenic. This paper deals with various types of cells using an aluminum cathode and a saturated solution of arsenic trioxide as the electrolyte. In the third section a literature survey is given on the various methods for determining minute amounts of fluorine with the purpose of finding one applicable to the determination of the element in urine. The results obtained using several of these are shown in the experimental work...|$|E
40|$|A {{sensitive}} method using HPLC with {{fluorescence detection}} {{has been established}} for the measurement of porphyrins in biological materials. The assay recoveries were 88. 0 +/- 1. 8 % for protoporphyrin IX in the blood, and ranged from 98. 3 +/- 2. 7 % to 111. 1 +/- 7. 4 % for various porphyrins in the urine. This method was employed to investigate the altered porphyrin profiles in rats after a single dose of various arsenicals including soluble sodium arsenate and sodium arsenite, and the relatively insoluble calcium arsenite, <b>calcium</b> <b>arsenate</b> and arsenic-contaminated soils at dose rates of 5 mg/kg or 0. 5 mg/kg body weight. Porphyrin concentrations increased within 24 - 48 hr after the arsenic treatment in blood and urine. Protoporphyrin IX is the predominant porphyrin in the blood. In rats administered 5 mg As(III) /kg body weight, protoporphyrin IX concentration elevated to 123 % of them control values in rats, 24 hr after the treatment. Higher increases were recorded in the urinary protoporphyrin IX (253 % at 24 hr; 397 % on day 2), uroporphyrin (121 % at 24 hr; 208 % on day 2) and coproporphyrin 111 (391 % at 24 hr; 304 % on day 2), while {{there was no significant}} increase (109 % on day 3) observed in the urinary coproporphyrin I excretion. In rats administered 5 mg As(V) /kg, urinary excretion of protoporphyrin IX, uroporphyrin, coproporphyrin Ill and coproporphyrin I elevated to the maximum levels by 48 hr with the corresponding percentage values compared to the control being 177 %, 158 %, 224 % and 143 %, respectively. In rats dosed with 5 mg As(III) /kg, the increases (expressed as % of the control values) of protoporphyrin IX in the blood were in the order: sodium arsenite (144 %) > sodium arsenate (125 %) {{greater than or equal to}} calcium arsenite (123 %) > <b>calcium</b> <b>arsenate.</b> In contrast, there was no significant increase of protoporphyrin K when the six arsenic-contaminated cattlei dip soils and nine copper chrome arsenate (CCA-contaminated) soils were administered to the rats.
