Yet the <b>contact</b> <b>adhesion</b> of the plated Ni-Cu contacts due to diffusion barriers in the contact area and electrical stability against tempering induced non-ohmic Ni shunts {{are two main}} challenges for this cell concept. This work presents failure mechanisms of laser doped solar cells. Microscopic characterization analyzes process induced defects separately, which result in poor <b>contact</b> <b>adhesion</b> and non-ohmic shunting.

40|$|The {{self-healing}} behaviour {{of materials}} with a particulate microstructure, which has experienced damage under uniaxial compression or tension, is studied with the Discrete Element Method. The stress-strain {{response of the}} particle system shows that the effective compressive and tensile strengths typically increase with the <b>contact</b> <b>adhesion</b> (i. e., the tensile strength between particles), where the effective compressive strength is about 5 {{times larger than the}} tensile strength. A sample with “weak ” <b>contact</b> <b>adhesion</b> is self-healed by instantaneously increasing the <b>contact</b> <b>adhesion</b> at different deformation levels from weak to “strong”. The stress-strain curves of self-healed samples are bounded by an envelope curve that reflects the damage response of a sample that has a “strong ” <b>contact</b> <b>adhesion</b> since the onset of loading. If self-healing is applied short before the peak stress is reached, the maximum sample strength will be close to maximum strength observed in the envelope curve. In contrast, if self-healing is initiated in the tensile softening regime, the maximum sample strength will be (significantly) less than the maximum strength related to the envelope curve...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} adhesion due to London–van der Waals attraction {{between a}} thin film and a patterned surface with nanometer asperities. Depending on the surface topography and the stiffness of the film, three regimes of adhesion are identified: complete <b>contact</b> <b>adhesion,</b> partial <b>contact</b> <b>adhesion,</b> and glassy adhesion. For complete <b>contact</b> <b>adhesion,</b> the film conforms to the undulations of the surface, whereas for partial contact and glassy adhesion, the adhesive interface breaks down into microscopic areas of contact. When a film in the glassy regime is peeled off the surface, metastable states develop at which the crack front becomes arrested, analogously to the frustrated motion of the three-phase contact line across a heterogeneous surface. For this glassy regime, we use transition state theory to model the thermally activated progression of the crack front. This theoretical treatment suggests {{that the rate of}} the adhesive failure increases exponentially with the applied force...|$|E

Cells interact with their extracellular matrix through cell <b>adhesion</b> <b>contacts.</b> We have previously described the self assembly of bone-like mineral onto an organic template and have shown that these biomimetic surfaces lead to an increased volume fraction of bone regenerated in vivo. In the present study, we compared the distribution of cell <b>adhesion</b> <b>contacts,</b> cell spreading, and cell motility of murine bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) on mineralized vs. nonmineralized substrates. We developed a new approach for quantification of cell-material interactions and demonstrated that cell <b>adhesion</b> <b>contacts</b> on mineralized substrates were distributed throughout the cell surface contacting the substrate, whereas on nonmineralized substrates cell <b>adhesion</b> <b>contacts</b> were present near the cell periphery. We propose that mineralized substrates stimulate the predominant expression of fibrillar contacts, and nonmineralized substrates stimulate expression of focal <b>adhesion</b> <b>contacts.</b> Cell motility assays with colloidal gold demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in the average phagokinetic index of migrating cells on mineralized vs. nonmineralized substrates after 90 min of cell seeding. We propose that the physical–chemical properties of the substrate, altered by mineralization, cause expression of specific types of cell contacts and, as a result, modify molecular mechanisms responsible for cell spreading, motility, and possibly differentiation. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|In {{this work}} we present {{the impact of}} Watts-type nickel {{electrolytes}} on the contact microstructure of the screen-printed silver contacts of silicon solar cells. Both an SEM and TEM analysis were used to investigate the reasons for poor <b>contact</b> <b>adhesion</b> following nickel plating. A failing interface was identified and located exactly between the glass frit and the bulk silver inside the contact. A clearly visible gap occurs at this interface due to a chemical dissolution of the boundary layer between the glass and the silver. In TEM measurements, no distinctive features in the elemental composition were identified at the failing interface that might {{be responsible for the}} site-specific dissolution. This suggests that the dissolution starts at the very thin oxide layer between the glass and the silver. Furthermore {{it became clear that the}} electrolyte reaches the identified failing interface via pores and cavities in the screen-printed silver layer. Closing these cavities prior to nickel electrolyte exposure thus lead to significantly better <b>contact</b> <b>adhesion</b> values...|$|E

This system is {{studied in the}} presence of <b>contact</b> <b>adhesion,</b> using the discrete element method (DEM). Several continuum fields like the density, the deformation gradient and the stress tensor are computed locally and are analyzed with the goal to formulate objective constitutive relations for the flow behavior of cohesive powders. From a single simulation only, by applying time- and (local) space-averaging, and focusing on the regions of the system that experienced considerable deformations, the critical-state yield stress (termination locus) can be obtained. It is close to linear, for non-cohesive granular materials, and nonlinear with peculiar pressure dependence, for adhesive powders—due to the nonlinear dependence of the <b>contact</b> <b>adhesion</b> on the confining forces. The contact model is simplified and possibly will need refinements and additional effects in order to resemble realistic powders. However, the promising method of how to obtain a critical-state yield stress from a single numerical test of one material is generally applicable and waits for calibration and validation...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe present work {{deals with}} the attack of {{different}} chemicals used in nickel and copper plating electrolytes, on screen printed silver front side contacts, which lowers the adhesion and hinders industrial implementation. Dipping tests with four different self-made pastes in isolated electrolyte compounds show the dissolution of silver for pastes with glass content and acidic exposure conditions in chemical trace analysis (ICP-OES) of the dip solution. These results can be correlated to the macroscopic <b>contact</b> <b>adhesion,</b> measured with quantitative peel force tests. The results {{show that there is}} a link between the amount of silver that is found in the dipping solutions after the exposure of the contacts, the measured <b>contact</b> <b>adhesion,</b> and the presence of glass in the contact. The reaction between glass and silver during the firing process forms an oxidation layer between silver and glass which provides good adhesion.

This continuum {{is important for the}} onset of muscle tissue generation, as muscle precursor cells (myoblasts) require a mechanical stimulus to initiate myogenesis. The ability to sense a mechanical cue requires an intact cytoskeleton and strong physical <b>contact</b> and <b>adhesion</b> to the microenvironment. Importantly, myoblasts also undergo reorientation, alignment and large scale remodeling of the cytoskeleton when they experience mechanical stretch and compression in muscle tissue. It remains unclear if such dramatic changes in cell architecture also inhibit physical <b>contact</b> and <b>adhesion</b> with the tissue microenvironment that are clearly important to myoblast physiology. In this study, we employed interference reflection microscopy to examine changes in the close physical contact of myoblasts with a substrate during induced remodeling of the cytoarchitecture (de-stabilization of the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton and inhibition of acto-myosin contractility). Our results demonstrate that while each remodeling pathway caused distinct effects on myoblast morphology and sub-cellular structure, we only observed a ~ 13 % decrease in close physical contact with the substrate, regardless of the pathway inhibited. However, this decrease did not correlate well with changes in cell adhesion strength. On the other hand, there was a close correlation between cell adhesion and β 1 -integrin expression and the presence of cell-secreted fibronectin, but not with the presence of intact focal adhesions.
