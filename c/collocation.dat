However, this somewhat traditional <b>collocation</b> was first challenged in 1970 by Karl-Heinz Priese who preferred to place Osorkon IV in a lower–Egyptian branch of the 23rd Dynasty, right after the reign of the shadowy pharaoh Pedubast II; this placement found the support of a certain number of scholars. Osorkon's mother, named on a electrum aegis of Sekhmet now in the Louvre, was Tadibast III. Osorkon IV's realm was restricted only to the district of Tanis (Rˁ-nfr) and the territory of Bubastis, both in the eastern Nile Delta. His neighbors were Libyan princes and Meshwesh chiefs who ruled their small realms outside of his authority.|$|E

30|$|According to Nakata (2006), {{the group}} of <b>collocations</b> which we can {{translate}} literally into the second language while keeping their meaning and sound natural in that language is named congruent <b>collocations.</b> In contrast, as Nakata (2006) maintains, non-congruent <b>collocations</b> are described as those <b>collocations</b> whose exact equivalent in the second language cannot be found so that its literal translation in the second language would yield an odd expression. Obviously, <b>collocations</b> constitute an essential section of vocabulary knowledge in multiple models of mental lexicon (Nation 2001). Although knowledge of <b>collocations</b> is gaining increasing momentum as an inevitable element of second language acquisition, investigations carried out on <b>collocations</b> reveal that L 2 learners face inherent challenges and problems while seeking to learn the <b>collocations</b> of another language (Howarth 1998).|$|R

40|$|Various {{studies have}} {{consistently}} shown that <b>collocations</b> are processed faster than matched control phrases, both in L 1 and in L 2. Most {{of these studies}} focused on adjacent <b>collocations</b> (e. g., provide information). However, research in corpus linguistics normally uses a span to identify <b>collocations</b> (e. g., ± 4 words), and these non-adjacent <b>collocations</b> (e. g., provide some of the information) occur very frequently in language. Nevertheless, how they are processed is less established. A recent study on reading non-adjacent <b>collocations</b> seems to suggest similar processing advantages as for adjacent <b>collocations</b> (Author 2016), but this {{study was limited to}} the performance of native speakers. The present study addresses the question of whether advanced non-native speakers also show processing advantages for nonadjacent <b>collocations</b> as native speakers do. Forty advanced non-native speakers of English read <b>collocations</b> in either adjacent or non-adjacent conditions, and their eye-movements were recorded. Mixed-effects analysis of their eye-movements was carried out. The results suggest that non-native speakers read adjacent <b>collocations</b> faster than non-formulaic controls, but this facilitation almost disappears for non-adjacent <b>collocations...</b>|$|R

25|$|The October Horse is {{the only}} {{instance}} of horse sacrifice in Roman religion; the Romans typically sacrificed animals that were {{a normal part of}} their diet. The unusual ritual of the October Horse has thus been analyzed at times in light of other Indo-European forms of horse sacrifice, such as the Vedic ashvamedha and the Irish ritual described by Giraldus Cambrensis, both of which have to do with kingship. Although the ritual battle for possession of the head may preserve an element from the early period when Rome was ruled by kings, the October Horse's <b>collocation</b> of agriculture and war is characteristic of the Republic. The sacred topography of the rite and the role of Mars in other equestrian festivals also suggest aspects of initiation and rebirth ritual. The complex or even contradictory aspects of the October Horse probably result from overlays of traditions accumulated over time.|$|E

40|$|<b>Collocations</b> (typical word {{associations}} like "to meet a condition", "to believe firmly", "highly controversial", "a deep concern") are {{pervasive in}} language.

40|$|<b>Collocations</b> {{are very}} {{frequent}} in the English language (Hill, 2000), {{and they are}} probably the most common and most representative of English multi-word expressions (Lewis, 2000). Furthermore, as a subset of formulaic sequences, <b>collocations</b> are considered to be a central aspect of communicative competence (Nation, 2001). Hence, the importance of teaching <b>collocations</b> in General English (GE) as well as in English for Specific Purposes (ESP) is undeniable. Understanding and determining the relevant <b>collocations</b> and their mastery are of “utmost importance to a ME instructor” (Cole et al., 2007, p. 137), and <b>collocations</b> {{are one of the most}} productive ways of enriching vocabulary and terminology in modern ME.

Hence, this paper tries to determine the most important <b>collocations</b> in Marine Engineering English, based on a small corpus of collected e-mails.

40|$|Abstract: It is {{now widely}} {{acknowledged}} that <b>collocations</b> {{play an important}} role in second and foreign language learning as well as in translation. <b>Collocations</b> have the features of being largely arbitrary and independent of meaning within and across languages, consequently, <b>collocations</b> could pose a tremendous challenge in translation, particularly if the translator lacks the ability to identify and recognize such collocational patterns. This study aims at investigating the translation of English grammatical <b>collocations</b> to find the acceptable equivalents for them in Azeri. Based on Benson et al’s classification of <b>collocations,</b> there are two types of <b>collocations,</b> lexical and grammatical <b>collocations.</b> In this research, the Azeri translations of grammatical <b>collocations</b> of noun + to-infinitive and predicative adjective + to-infinitive have been analyzed. Based on the analysis of data, it has been cleared that in Azeri, noun + to-infinitive and predicative adjective + to-infinitive are translated as “infinitive +noun ” and “infinitive+ predicative adjective ” respectively. This research is corpus-based study, both qualitative and quantitative. Key Words: translation; translation problems; collocation; grammatical collocation; corpus-based stud...|$|R

2500|$|Palmer concurred with numismatists who regard a denarius minted by Quintus Titius, moneyer ca. 90–88 BC, as picturing an {{aged and}} bearded Mutunus on its obverse. The winged diadem is a {{reference}} to the Priapus of Lampsacus and to the winged phallus as a common motif in Roman decorative arts, which can also serve as an apotropaic charm against the evil eye. Another issue by Titius pictures an ivy-crowned Bacchus, with both denarii having a virtually identical Pegasus on the reverse. Michael Crawford finds [...] "no good grounds" [...] for identifying this figure as Mutunus, but Palmer points to the shared iconography of the Bacchus–Liber–Priapus figure and the associative etymology of the gens name Titius. A titus ("penis") with wings was a visual pun, since the word also referred to a type of bird. Varro seems to have associated Titinus with the Titii, in an etymological <b>collocation</b> that included Titus Tatius, the royal Sabine contemporary of Romulus; the Curia Titia; or the tribus of the Titienses, one of the three original tribes of Rome.|$|E
2500|$|A few {{examples}} will illustrate {{this difference in}} the method of interpretation between the older and the younger Halakah. It was a generally accepted opinion that the first Passover celebrated in Egypt, that of the Exodus, differed from those that followed it, in that at the first one the prohibition of leavened bread was for a single day only, whereas at subsequent Passovers this restriction extended to seven days. The older halakha (in Mek., Bo, 16 [...] ), represented by R. Jose the Galilean, bases its interpretation on a different division of the sentences in Ex. xiii. than the one generally received; connecting the word [...] "ha-yom" [...] (= [...] "this day"), {{which is the first}} word of verse 4, with verse 3 and so making the passage read: [...] "There shall no leavened bread be eaten this day." [...] The younger halakha reads [...] "ha-yom" [...] with verse 4, and finds its support for the traditional halakha by means of the principle of [...] "semukot" [...] (collocation); that is to say, the two sentences, [...] "There shall no leavened bread be eaten," [...] and [...] "This day came ye out," [...] though they are separated grammatically, are immediately contiguous in the text, and exert an influence over each other (Pes. 28b, 96b). What the older halakha regarded as the obvious meaning of the words of the text, the younger infers from the <b>collocation</b> of the sentences.|$|E

2500|$|The {{historical}} {{development of the}} stare + gerund progressive in those Romance languages that have {{it seems to have}} been a passage from a usage such as sto pensando 'I stand/stay (here) thinking', in which the stare form carries the full semantic load of 'stand, stay' to grammaticalization of the construction as expression of progressive aspect. The process of reanalysis that took place over time bleached the semantics of stare so that when used in combination with the gerund the form became solely a grammatical marker of subject and tense (e.g. sto = subject first person singular, present; stavo = subject first person singular, past), no longer a lexical verb with the semantics of 'stand' (not unlike the auxiliary in compound tenses that once meant 'have, possess', but is now semantically empty: j'ai écrit, ho scritto, he escrito, etc.). Whereas sto scappando would once have been semantically strange at best (?'I stay escaping'), once grammaticalization was achieved, <b>collocation</b> with a verb of inherent mobility was no longer contradictory, and sto scappando could and did become the normal way to express 'I am escaping'. (Although it might be objected that in sentences like Spanish la catedral está en la ciudad, [...] "the cathedral is in the city" [...] this is also unlikely to change, but all locations are expressed through estar in Spanish, as this usage originally conveyed the sense of [...] "the cathedral stands in the city").|$|E

[...] In an analysis of other aspects, Foster argued, [...] "The general diction {{of the work is}} admirably strong, and various, and free; and, in going through it, we have repeatedly exulted in the capabilities of the English language. The author seems to have in a great measure grown out of that affected simplicity of expression, of which he has generally been accused. The versification, as to measure and rhyme, is a complete defiance of all rule, and all example... This is objectionable, chiefly, as it allows the poet to riot away in a wild wantonness of amplification". An anonymous review in the June 1811 Literary Panorama stated, [...] "If we were desired to name a poet whose command of language enables him to express in the most suitable and energetic terms the images which agitate his mind, we should name Mr. Southey; if we were requested to point out a poem which to freedom of manner in the construction of its stanzas, united a condensation of phrase, with a happy <b>collocation</b> of words, thereby producing force, we should recommend Kehama".|$|E
60|$|Now it is {{the very}} nature of a {{derivative}} law which has not yet been resolved into its elements, in other words, an empirical law, that we do not know whether it results from the different effects of one cause, or from effects of different causes. We can not tell whether it depends wholly on laws, or partly on laws and partly on a <b>collocation.</b> If it depends on a <b>collocation,</b> it will be true in all the cases in which that particular <b>collocation</b> exists. But, since we are entirely ignorant, in case of its depending on a <b>collocation,</b> what the <b>collocation</b> is, we are not safe in extending the law beyond the limits of time and place in which we have actual experience of its truth. Since within those limits the law has always been found true, we have evidence that the collocations, whatever they are, on which it depends, do really exist within those limits. But, knowing of no rule or principle to which the collocations themselves conform, we can not conclude that because a <b>collocation</b> is proved to exist within certain limits of place or time, it will exist beyond those limits. Empirical laws, therefore, can only be received as true within the limits of time and place in which they have been found true by observation; and not merely the limits of time and place, but of time, place, and circumstance; for, since {{it is the}} very meaning of an empirical law that we do not know the ultimate laws of causation on which it is dependent, we can not foresee, without actual trial, in what manner or to what extent the introduction of any new circumstance may affect it.|$|E
