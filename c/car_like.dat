5|$|Weevil (Francis Capra) organizes {{a meeting}} between Veronica and the PCHers, and the new leader says {{that they would not}} kill someone over a bad <b>car</b> <b>like</b> the Coach's vehicle. Mason (Robert Ri'chard), one of the team's former star {{basketball}} players, testifies to Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) that Josh is responsible for his father’s death. The Sheriff arrests Josh, and Veronica learns that the Coach's car was found in the water. Logan and Heather begin to actually enjoy each other's company. Keith speaks to Mindy O'Dell (Jaime Ray Newman), stating that he will continue to search for Dean Cyrus O'Dell's killer. Veronica questions Mason, but he ends up angrily walking away. Veronica and Keith recuperate, and Keith says that Cyrus's car was taken out within the timeframe of the murder. Heather sends a radio request to play a special song from Logan to Veronica, while Veronica interrogates the hotel staff. One of them says that he heard two men yelling in the room. Veronica and Logan have a chance meeting in the elevator.|$|E

50|$|In the UK, some Japanese {{domestic}} market models fetch {{a high price}} in the UK because of their performance, novelty or status. Popular types include - off-road vehicles, people carriers, affordable sports <b>cars</b> <b>like</b> the Mazda MX5 / Eunos, very high performance sports <b>cars</b> <b>like</b> the, rally homologation based <b>cars</b> <b>like</b> the Subaru Impreza and Mitsubishi Evo, ultra compact kei cars, and limited edition Japanese market designer <b>cars</b> <b>like</b> the Nissan Figaro.|$|R
50|$|The {{addition}} was {{to allow}} Formula One <b>cars,</b> <b>like</b> those {{competing in the}} World Drivers Championship, or more optimistically second-hand <b>cars</b> <b>like</b> those in the British AFX Aurora series. The move however only attracted British former F1 driver Guy Edwards driving a Fittipaldi.|$|R
25|$|Kei <b>cars</b> (<b>like</b> the Mitsubishi i, Subaru R2, and Suzuki Carry) {{are common}} in Singapore, but not as popular as in Japanese {{domestic}} market as most Japanese car manufacturers seldom release Kei cars in Singapore.

25|$|In 1983 {{he heard}} about a $4,000-to-win race at the {{speedway}} in Chula Vista, California. He saw {{a picture of a}} flat-wedge shaped race car that Charlie Swartz had used to win the Dirt Track World Championship in 1982, and he decided to build a race <b>car</b> <b>like</b> it for the Chula Vista race. Bloomquist won the race, lapping the field twice in the process.|$|E
25|$|After {{updating}} the factory team cars {{with a larger}} 1701cc Cosworth BDB engine in 1972 and then with fuel injected BDC, Ford also produced an RS2000 model {{as an alternative to}} the somewhat temperamental RS1600, featuring a 2.0L Pinto (OHC) engine. This also clocked up some rally and racing victories; and pre-empted the hot hatch market as a desirable but affordable performance road <b>car.</b> <b>Like</b> the Mexico and RS1600, this car was produced at the Aveley plant.|$|E
50|$|Roadster {{bodies were}} offered on {{automobiles}} {{of all sizes}} and classes, from mass-produced <b>cars</b> <b>like</b> the Ford Model T and the Austin 7 to extremely expensive <b>cars</b> <b>like</b> the Cadillac V-16, the Duesenberg Model J, and even the Bugatti Royale. They are popular with collectors, often valued over other open styles.|$|R

25|$|Ford Motor Company had {{conducted}} the right marketing study, {{but it came}} up with the wrong product to fill the gap between Ford and Mercury. By 1958, buyers had become fascinated with economy cars, and a large <b>car</b> <b>like</b> the Edsel was seen as too expensive to buy and own. When Ford introduced the Falcon in 1960, it sold over 400,000 units in its first year. Ford's investment in expanded plant capacity and additional tooling for the Edsel helped make the company's subsequent success with the Falcon possible.|$|E
25|$|In November 1925, Celestino Madeiros, an ex-convict {{awaiting}} trial for murder, confessed to committing the Braintree crimes. He absolved Sacco and Vanzetti of participation. In May, once the SJC had denied their appeal and Madeiros was convicted, the defense investigated {{the details of}} Madeiros' story. Police interviews {{led them to the}} Morelli gang based in Providence, Rhode Island. They developed an alternative theory of the crime based on the gang’s history of shoe-factory robberies, connections to a <b>car</b> <b>like</b> that used in Braintree, and other details. Gang leader Joe Morelli bore a striking resemblance to Sacco.|$|E
25|$|For example, the Chicago City Railway, also {{designed}} by Eppelsheimer, opened in Chicago in 1882 {{and went on}} to become the largest and most profitable cable car system. As with many cities, the problem in flat Chicago was not one of incline, but of transportation capacity. This caused a different approach to the combination of grip car and trailer. Rather than using a grip car and single trailer, as many cities did, or combining the grip and trailer into a single <b>car,</b> <b>like</b> San Francisco's California Cars, Chicago used grip cars to pull trains of up to three trailers.|$|E

25|$|This {{is due in}} part to the {{reduction}} in the costs of COE and PARF between 2000 and 2005, which has incentivised owners to purchase new cars before their ten years is up. Previously, the COE and PARF represented around 80% of the cost of a medium-priced <b>car</b> <b>like</b> the Honda Accord. With the COE and PARF less expensive than in the past, in some cases the yearly drop in the COE and PARF rebate becomes significant compared to the pre-tax (OMV) price of a new car. Furthermore, with the PARF rebate starting to diminish after a car is five years old, the net amount of credit (similar to resale value or trade-in value) compared to the OMV becomes less favourable for owners of older cars. In contrast, in countries with low taxes, the most economical ownership strategy is to keep a car as long as possible until repair costs exceed a new car's depreciation costs or financing costs.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} compete in {{international}} rallying, the car had to be homologated; for Group 4, the class the HS was {{to compete in}}, this meant building 400 production vehicles for public sale. Vauxhall created a far more powerful Chevette variant by fitting the 2.3litre slant-four engine, using a 16-valve cylinder head which Vauxhall was developing - though the rally cars used the Lotus 16-valve head until a rule change by the FIA banned them in 1978. Fitted with two Stromberg carburettors the engine developed 135 bhp. Suspension and rear axle were from the Opel Kadett C GT/E and the gearbox was a Getrag five-speed. Chevrolet Vega alloy wheels (similar in appearance to the Avon wheels used on the droopsnoot Firenza) were used, {{as well as a}} newly developed glass-reinforced plastic air dam. The result was a very fast and well handling, if rather unrefined, road <b>car.</b> <b>Like</b> the Droopsnoot Firenza, the HS was available only in silver, with red highlighting and a bright red, black and tartan interior; though (partly to help sell unsold vehicles) some cars were repainted in other colours, such the black Mamos Garage HS-X.|$|E

500|$|For the 1984 season, Audi added two-time world {{champion}} Walter Röhrl to their star line-up and Mouton {{now had a}} part-time role, competing in five WRC events. For {{the first time in}} nine years, she did not enter the Monte Carlo Rally. However, Mouton signed up to commentate the event for Radio Monte Carlo. She started her year well by finishing second at the Swedish Rally behind teammate and home favourite Blomqvist. Mouton later stated that [...] "finishing second was fantastic. When you are out rallying on ice or snow in country like that it is like dancing. From {{one side to the other}} side. My dancing background helped my rallying. As soon as I started on gravel I liked it because of that. It was so nice to feel and move the <b>car</b> <b>like</b> that. Sweden, in ice and snow, like ballet!" [...] This would remain her last podium position in the World Rally Championship.|$|E
500|$|Jeff Gordon {{appeared}} in victory lane {{to celebrate his}} first win of the 2009 season in front of 176,300 who attended the race. He also earned $541,874 in race winnings. Gordon was delighted with his victory: [...] "Incredible team effort. This whole year has been amazing. What a great car. I've never had a <b>car</b> <b>like</b> this at Texas. We finally had one {{and put it in}} position." [...] Johnson was happy with his second-place result, saying, [...] "It was nice to get our car up front and get some clean air on it. We had to work really hard all day long to keep the car right. I'm very proud of the team." [...] Third-place finisher Biffle was candid with his performance: [...] "We worked our way {{all the way back to}} fourth, third -- 15 more laps, would've passed [...] and then a little while longer we could've gotten [...] But, I just ran out of time, lost track position and weren't able to capitalize on it." ...|$|E

2500|$|New for 1970 was the Estate Wagon, which {{shared the}} Electra's 455 V8 and four VentiPorts, {{but was a}} B-body <b>car</b> <b>like</b> the LeSabre and the Wildcat and {{consequently}} shared the smaller cars' [...] wheelbase and interior.

2500|$|A {{primitive}} way {{to implement}} cruise control {{is simply to}} lock the throttle position when the driver engages cruise control. [...] However, if the cruise control is engaged on a stretch of flat road, then the car will travel slower going uphill and faster when going downhill. This type of controller is called an open-loop controller {{because there is no}} feedback; no measurement of the system output (the car's speed) is used to alter the control (the throttle position.) As a result, the controller cannot compensate for changes acting on the <b>car,</b> <b>like</b> a change in the slope of the road.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} AMX full-scale {{models were}} developed in 1965 by AMC's advanced styling studios {{under the direction of}} Charles Mashigan. The two-seat AMX was [...] "big hit on the auto show circuit in 1966" [...] and featured a rumble seat that opened out from the rear decklid for extra passengers called a [...] "Ramble" [...] seat. AMC executives saw the opportunity to change the consumers' perception of the automaker from Romney's economy car image, to the realities of the new marketplace interested in sporty, performance oriented vehicles. Robert B. Evans requested a <b>car</b> <b>like</b> the AMX to be put into production quickly.|$|E
