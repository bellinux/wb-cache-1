5|$|The Browns {{went on to}} win the {{championship}} game in 1946, helped by Speedie's six catches for 71 yards. Speedie led the league in yards per <b>catch,</b> <b>with</b> 23.5, and scored seven touchdowns. After the season, he was named along with several teammates to the AAFC's all-league team.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} Wijdefjorden {{was first used}} by Russian, and later Norwegian, trappers. The cabin at Krosspynten was erected in 1910, {{and two years later}} the cabin at Purpurdalen was built. Trappers {{considered}} the area to have few polar bears but much fox; they could also supplement the <b>catch</b> <b>with</b> common eider. In 1928, a season of trapping gave about 50 Arctic foxes. In 1932, the area's special vegetation was protected, which was assimilated into the national park when it was created. Since the 1980s, trapping has again been taken up, and the Governor of Svalbard has one cabin at Austfjordnes that can be rented for a season of trapping. Of the larger fjords on Svalbard, Wijdefjorden is the least affected by humans.|$|E
5|$|Granderson and Daniel Murphy {{were the}} two most {{productive}} hitters in the Mets lineup during their 2015 postseason run to the World Series. While Murphy cooled off in the World Series against the Kansas City Royals, Granderson {{continued to be a}} consistent threat for the Mets out of the leadoff spot and also had three home runs and five RBIs in that World Series. In Game 1, after the Royals tied the game in the ninth inning with a home run off Mets closer Jeurys Familia, Granderson made an excellent leaping <b>catch</b> <b>with</b> nobody out {{in the bottom of the}} 11th inning, off the bat of the Royals fastest runner Jarrod Dyson, preventing what would have at least been a lead off triple and likely saving the game at the time, though the Royals would go on to win the game anyway in the bottom of the 14th inning on a sacrifice fly by Eric Hosmer. Throughout the series, playing right field, Granderson played the most consistent and solid defense of any Mets fielder.|$|E

5|$|Net-casting spiders weave {{only small}} webs, but then {{manipulate}} them to trap prey. Those {{of the genus}} Hyptiotes and the family Theridiosomatidae stretch their webs and then release them when prey strike them, but do not actively move their webs. Those of the family Deinopidae weave even smaller webs, hold them outstretched between their first two pairs of legs, and lunge and push the webs as much as twice their own body length to trap prey, and this move may increase the webs' area {{by a factor of}} up to ten. Experiments have shown that Deinopis spinosus has two different techniques for trapping prey: backwards strikes to catch flying insects, whose vibrations it detects; and forward strikes to catch ground-walking prey that it sees. These two techniques have also been observed in other deinopids. Walking insects form most of the prey of most deinopids, but one population of Deinopis subrufa appears to live mainly on tipulid flies that they <b>catch</b> <b>with</b> the backwards strike.|$|E
5|$|On Rubicun III, the Edo {{explain to}} Lt. Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby) and Worf that capital {{punishment}} {{is used to}} enforce their laws. The away team rush to warn Wesley, only to discover he has accidentally broken a greenhouse while playing <b>catch</b> <b>with</b> the Edo youths. An Edo policeman attempts to give Wesley a lethal injection for this infraction of the law, but Yar and Worf draw their phasers. On the ship, the sphere leaves Data's body and departs. Picard, upon hearing of the situation with Wesley, transports to the surface. He meets {{with representatives of the}} Edo in a council chamber and explains that Earth no longer practices capital punishment. Some Edo interpret this stance as an attempt by the Federation to push their superiority and suggest that Picard should mount a rescue effort for the boy. He says he cannot, quoting the Prime Directive.|$|E

25|$|The two {{officials}} {{near the}} play conferred and then simultaneously made separate signals; side judge Lance Easley {{raised his arms}} to signal touchdown, while back judge Derrick Rhone-Dunn waved his arms to signal stoppage of the clock. Because Rhone-Dunn signaled timeout so as to stop the already expired game clock, Rhone-Dunn indicated that he desired further investigation of the play before rendering a verdict whereas Easley, from his angle, found sufficient evidence of a simultaneous <b>catch</b> <b>with</b> which to call a touchdown. The ruling on the field was officially a touchdown, with Tate and Jennings maintaining simultaneous possession.|$|E

25|$|During {{the night}} of July 14, 1924, 9-year-old Francis McDonnell was {{reported}} missing by his parents. He failed to return home after playing <b>catch</b> <b>with</b> friends in the Port Richmond neighbourhood of Staten Island. A search was organised and his body was found—hanging by a tree—in a wooded area near his home. He had been sexually assaulted, then strangled with his suspenders. According to an autopsy, McDonnell had also suffered extensive lacerations to his legs and abdomen, and his left hamstring had almost entirely been stripped of its flesh. Fish refused to claim responsibility for this, although he later stated {{that he intended to}} castrate the boy but fled when he heard someone approaching the area.|$|E
25|$|Mays {{was born}} in 1931 in Westfield, Alabama. His father, Cat Mays, was a talented {{baseball}} player with the Negro team for the local iron plant. His mother, Annie Satterwhite, was a gifted basketball and track star in high school. His parents never married before or after Mays' birth. As a baby, Mays was cared for by his mother's younger sisters Sarah and Ernestine. Sarah became the primary female role model in Mays' life. His father exposed him to baseball at an early age, and {{by the age of}} five he was playing <b>catch</b> <b>with</b> his father. At age 10, Mays was allowed to sit on the bench of his father's League games.|$|E

25|$|Western school whiting {{are taken}} in {{relatively}} small quantities {{in comparison to}} other western Australian sillaginids such as Sillago schomberkii and Sillaginodes punctatus, but has a few minor fisheries developed around it. The first is off Rottnest Island, where it is trawled in deeper offshore waters, and also in Shark Bay, where {{it is one of}} a number of sillaginids landed. In Shark Bay it can comprise up to 20% of the entire whiting <b>catch,</b> <b>with</b> fishermen giving it the name 'bastard whiting' as large numbers of S. vittata mean lower numbers of their targeted species. Of the approximately 177 000kg of whiting taken in Western Australia, less than 2152kg of this is attributable to S. vittata, making it one of the less important fisheries to the state.|$|E
25|$|After lunch, Ponting {{began looking}} dangerous, scoring three fours off one R. P. Singh over {{before he was}} {{dismissed}} by Harbhajan Singh for the seventh time in his career. Australia were 3/119 {{at the end of}} the 30th over. Hussey edged the first ball of the next over to Tendulkar who took a low catch at first slip, bringing Andrew Symonds to the crease. Michael Clarke fell in the over after, not offering a shot to a straight, full ball on leg stump and being adjudged LBW, leaving Australia at 5/121. Singh soon drew an edge from Gilchrist to Tendulkar at first slip once again, who had to dive forward to take the <b>catch.</b> <b>With</b> only one specialist batsman remaining, Australia were at 6/135, with India having the clear upper hand.|$|E
25|$|Pittsburgh {{jumped to}} a 17–7 halftime lead, aided by linebacker James Harrison's Super Bowl-record 100-yard {{interception}} {{return for a}} touchdown. Trailing 20–7 {{at the start of}} the fourth quarter, Arizona scored 16 consecutive points, including a safety by Pittsburgh that led to wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald's 64-yard touchdown reception, to take the first lead of the game with 2:37 remaining. But the Steelers marched 78 yards to score on wide receiver Santonio Holmes' 6-yard game-winning touchdown <b>catch</b> <b>with</b> 35 seconds left. Holmes, who caught nine passes for 131 yards and a touchdown, including four receptions for 73 yards on that final game-winning drive, was named Super Bowl MVP. He became the sixth wide receiver to win the award, half of whom are Steelers (Lynn Swann and Hines Ward).|$|E

25|$|In Southern Australia, the King George whiting {{is often}} the sole target for {{fishermen}} who seek it for its high quality eating. A number of coastal towns rely heavily on the species as a tourism drawcard for anglers seeking a range of fish and crustacean species, but King George whiting {{is often the}} most desired catch. They are a relatively easy species to <b>catch,</b> <b>with</b> no special baits, rigs or techniques required and are often caught from jetties, beaches and rocks; meaning a boat is not necessary. Simple rigs such varieties of running ball sinker or paternoster rigs are commonly used, with a fixed sinker employed in area of high tidal movement. As mentioned previously, molluscs, particularly the Goolwa cockle are common bait, with varieties of worms, gents, squid, cuttlefish, fish pieces and especially raw king prawn are commonly successful. The larger fish inhabiting deep reefs are often caught on whole pilchards while fishing for snapper and morwong.|$|E
25|$|Ponting and Hayden batted until lunch, however, adding 58 in 17 overs {{before the}} break was taken, and a further 37 overs was played in the {{afternoon}} session. Through 34 of them, Australia lost no further wicket, before Hayden edged a ball from Pollock to Graeme Smith at slip for 65. Pollock got one further wicket on the day, removing Brad Hodge for 7 with the score at three for 176, but Ponting stuck in, getting his 26th Test century in the 68th over. He pushed on to 117 before he was caught off Nel, who paid back for his dropped <b>catch</b> <b>with</b> four wickets in eight overs; he also got Andrew Symonds for a duck, Adam Gilchrist for two and Shane Warne for nine. Makhaya Ntini then ended the day five balls before the scheduled minimum of 90 overs by having Brett Lee lbw on four, which left Mike Hussey not out on 23 overnight with Stuart MacGill and Glenn McGrath (both with Test batting averages below 10) yet to bat.|$|E
