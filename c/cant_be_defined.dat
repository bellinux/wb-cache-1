With these philosophical theories {{as a point of}} depature, two works of art are analyzed. The chosen pieces, a sculpture made by Christian Lemmerz and a poem by Charles Baudelaire, respectively, are both seemingly repulsive but still have a beautiful aspect clinging to them. The pieces are chosen to examine wether they can or <b>cant</b> <b>be</b> <b>defined</b> as art and as aesthetic works...|$|E
40|$|Many lexicographers {{found some}} words {{unsuitable}} {{for inclusion in}} their dictionaries, thus the examination of general purpose dictionaries alone will not give us a faithful history of changes of the language. Nevertheless, by taking into account cant and slang dictionaries, the origins and history of such marginalized language can be truly examined. Despite people's natural fascination with these works, the early slang dictionaries have received relatively little scholarly attention, the later ones even less. This dissertation is written to honor those lexicographers who succeeded in a truthful documentation of nonstandard language. One of these disreputable lexicographers who found joy in an unending search for new and better ways of treating abstruse vocabulary was John Camden Hotten. This study investigates the importance of Hotten's Dictionary of Modern Slang, Cant, and Vulgar Words {{in the evolution of}} dictionary making. I analyze how many editions exist, the popularity of the 1864 edition, and differences between this and preceding editions, suggesting the inexorable growth of Hotten as a compiler. A short history of British cant and slang lexicography is provided and questions concerning the inclusion and exclusion of obsolete words and who makes such decisions are answered. Key terms such as slang and <b>cant</b> <b>are</b> <b>defined</b> and discussed briefly within the context of recent, relevant scholarship. The conclusions drawn from this research are laid out in extensive annotations embedded in the lexical items of a critical edition demonstrating once again that Hotten's compilation was extremely important in the evolution of dictionary making. That Hotten's work was accepted as authoritative is evidenced by the number of allusions and borrowings from it as seen in the work of later lexicographers: Barrere and Leland draw extensively upon it in A Dictionary of Slang, Jargon, and Cant, 2 vols. (1889 - 90) as do Farmer and Henley in Slang and Its Analogues, 7 vols. (1890 - 1904), and Eric Partridge in A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English (1937). Hotten's work seems to have been very influential in the preservation of words as well. A vast number of slang words that are cited in Hotten's dictionaries were used for a long time among the common people; in fact, the popular literature of the nineteenth century, particularly historical fiction, draws upon this vocabulary, and may well prove to be specifically indebted to Hotten's work. Thackeray's Vanity Fair and Joyce's Ulysses are full of slang expressions; Conan Doyle shows himself familiar with the terminology of pugilism in Rodney Stone, as does George Bernard Shaw in Cashel Byron's Profession. This dissertation places John Camden Hotten as a writer/publisher/compiler and his work within contemporaneous scholarly argument, and, contrary to popular opinion, acknowledges the publisher's significant contributions to the development of Victorian literature and late nineteenth- and twentieth-century lexicography...|$|R

The change in <b>cant</b> <b>is</b> {{required in order to}} connect a tangent track (no cant) to a curved track (with cant) through a transition curve.

Track twist may also be used to describe cant gradient which may be expressed in percentage of cant change per length unit. However, in the UK, the term track twist is normally used in the context of cant gradient with higher values which are considered to be faults.|$|R

The relation between worker and employer in <b>Canting</b> <b>is</b> not like {{the relation between}} worker and employer but the relation of family. The fact that the author of Canting wrote that employer in <b>Canting</b> <b>is</b> capitalist make the writer wants to know capitalism deeper {{especially in terms of}} the relation between worker and employer. Besides using Karl Marx’s capitalism theory, the writer uses sociological approach because the relation between worker and employer is the social relation between the social classes in society. After the writer did research, the writer found differences between the relation of worker and employer in Canting with worker and employer’s relation according to Karl Marx’s capitalism. Based on the differences appears between Canting with Karl Marx’s capitalism, that the relation between worker and employer in <b>Canting</b> <b>is</b> affected by several things including Javanese culture. Therefore, the writer proves that not all the relations between worker and employer are in accordance with capitalism...|$|R
