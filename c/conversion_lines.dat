40|$|Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor [L] Moench) {{was first}} {{introduced}} to the United States in the 1800 s. These introductions consisted of tropical varieties with a short day photoperiod response that limited their use in temperate hybrid breeding programs. Commercial exploitation of F 1 hybrids in grain sorghum started by the mid 1950 s {{with the use of}} cytoplasmic male sterility system CMS (A 1). Even though other CMS are available, most sorghum hybrid seed production still relies on the A 1 system. Genetic gain in most agronomic crop species is limited by several factors. In the specific case of sorghum, the uniform use of the CMS (A 1) system and the recent introduction of sorghum to the United States have resulted in a reduction of its genetic base. In order to create enough genetic variability, plant breeders might utilize exotic non adapted material, exotic adapted material or existing elite material as a source of new alleles that will protect and improve genetic gain through selection. This study provides an estimate of the genetic diversity existing in a set of sorghum <b>conversion</b> <b>lines.</b> The objectives of this study were: (1) to estimate the genetic diversity present among a set of 16 sorghum <b>conversion</b> <b>lines????</b> (2) to classify this set of lines based on genetic similarities estimated using AFLP markers and (3) to estimate heterosis, general and specific combining ability for grain yield among the set of <b>conversion</b> <b>lines.</b> Genetic diversity was present in the set of <b>conversion</b> <b>lines</b> evaluated. For the lines included only in this study, Caudatum was the most homogenous race (average GS = 0. 69), and this race was closely related to the Durra race (Average GS = 0. 66).

Good heterotic responses were obtained from DurraKafir races and CaudatumKafir races. Estimation of SCA, MPH and BPH identified specific crosses that were numerically superior than those of the checks. The use of AFLP markers allowed the identification of five strong clusters through estimates of genetic similarities. This classification did not group the lines by either their genetic background or their fertility reaction.

40|$|NOTE: text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. A magnetic lens spectrometer {{has been used}} to measure electron yields from the internal conversion of certain nuclear gamma rays. Auxiliary experiments have been performed to determine the effective solid angle of the spectrometer. A technique which has previously proven to be successful has been tested and employed in the measurement of gamma-ray yields by means of a scintillation counter. The combination of conversion electron and gamma yield measurements constitutes an experimental determination of an internal conversion coefficient, and by comparison with theory it is possible to make gamma-ray multipole order assignments. Bi 207 decays to an isomeric state of Pb 207 at 1. 63 Mev which emits two successive gamma rays with energies 1. 06 and 0. 57 Mev, the decay proceeding through a level at 0. 57 Mev. Internal <b>conversion</b> <b>lines</b> from both transitions have been observed previously. We have measured the conversion coefficients and found the 1. 06 -Mev line to be M 4 with E 2 indicated for the 0. 57 -Mev line.

40|$|The nuclear {{levels of}} Ta 181 were {{investigated}} by {{a study of}} the β decay of Hf 181 and the electron capture decay of W 181. Evidence for weak M-shell <b>conversion</b> <b>lines</b> of an ∼ 6 -kev transition in the Hf 181 was found with a β spectrometer. An investigation of the W 181 decay with this instrument revealed strong M-shell <b>conversion</b> <b>lines</b> corresponding to a 6. 25 ± 0. 3 -kev transition. With the aid of additional evidence, the conclusion is made that the 476 -kev transition in the Hf 181 decay occurs between the 482 -kev level and a new level at 6 kev. On using an argon proportional counter, a 6 -kev γ ray was also found in the W 181 decay. The conversion coefficient of this transition was determined to be αT= 44 ± 7. This conversion coefficient and the M-subshell conversion ratios indicate that the 6 -kev transition is of E 1 multipolarity. The 6 -kev level is assigned as the 9 / 2 - [514] Nilsson intrinsic state. It is also concluded that the previously reported 152 -kev transition in the W 181 decay occurs between a new 11 / 2 - (K= 9 / 2 -) rotational level at 158 kev and the 6 -kev level. From a measurement of the tantalum L/K x-ray intensity ratio, the W 181 decay energy is found to be 176 - 22 + 44 kev. The branchings of this decay to the various Ta 181 levels are as follows: 158 kev (0. 11 %), 136 kev (0. 067 %), 6. 25 kev (∼ 35 %), and ground state (∼ 65 %).

40|$|The nuclear {{levels of}} Ta 181 were {{investigated}} by {{the study of the}} [beta]-decay of Hf 181 and the electron capture decay of W 181. The previously reported 476 kev transition from the Hf 181 decay was found not to be in coincidence with the 482 kev transition, thus ruling out the level proposed at 958 kev. Evidence for weak M-shell <b>conversion</b> <b>lines</b> of a ~ 6 kev transition in the Hf 181 decay was found with a 180 ° [beta]-spectrometer. A [beta]-spectrometer investigation of the W 181 decay revealed strong M-shell <b>conversion</b> <b>lines</b> which correspond to a transition of 6. 25 ± 0. 3 kev in energy. On the basis of the above mentioned results and other considerations, it is concluded that the 476 kev transition in the Hf 181 decay occurs between the 482 kev level and the new 6 kev level. A 6 kev [gamma]-ray was also found in the W 181 decay with an argon proportional counter. From these studies, the conversion coefficient of the 6 kev transition was determined to be [alpha]T = 44 ± 7. The conversion coefficient and the M-subshell conversion ratios require that the 6 kev transition is of El multipolarity. From this assignment and other experimental and theoretical considerations, it is concluded that the 6 kev level is the 9 / 2 - [514] Nilsson intrinsic state. Arguments can also be made that the previously reported 152 kev transition in the W 181 decay occurs between a new 11 / 2 - rotational level at 158 kev and the 6 kev level. From a measurement of the tantalum L/K x-ray intensity ratio, the W 181 electron capture L/K branching ratio (to the ground state and the 6 kev level) is found to be PL/PK = 0. 359, and the W 181 decay energy is found to be 176 (+ 44) (- 22) kev. The branchings of this decay to the various Ta 181 levels are as follows: 158 kev (0. 12 %), 136 kev (0. 075 %), 6. 25 kev (~ 35 %), and 0 kev (~ 65 %).
