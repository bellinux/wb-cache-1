25|$|It's a Wonderful Life won {{just the}} one Academy Award, in the Technical Achievement {{category}} for developing a new method of creating artificial snow. Before It's a Wonderful Life, fake movie snow was mostly made from <b>cornflakes</b> painted white. And it was so loud when stepped on that any snow-filled scenes with dialogue had to be re-dubbed afterwards. RKO studio's head of special effects, Russell Sherman, developed a new compound, utilizing water, soap flakes, foamite and sugar.|$|E

500|$|Becky Bain of 'Idolator' {{was more}} {{positive}} {{of the song}} saying she [...] "actually forgot Lopez is still considered a singer, what with her two-year hiatus to focus on all her fragrances and clothing lines and babies and such. It's nice to have her back—yes, not every J-Lo song was a hit, but we all danced to 'If You Had My Love' and 'Waiting for Tonight' back in the day. 'Louboutins' ... definitely has the catchiest chorus she's had in years. This could actually bring Jennifer out of the pit her last album Brave dug her into." [...] Nick Levine from Digital Spy described the track as [...] "a Tricky and The-Dream-produced club banger with a chorus that succeeds through sheer attrition, with a proper Janet Jackson-style dance break. [...] Truth be told, it's not a J.Lo classic to rival 'Play' or 'Love Don't Cost a Thing', and it's about as original as starting your day {{with a bowl of}} Kellogg's <b>Cornflakes,</b> but it does burrow into your brain after a few spins." ...|$|E

[...] Starr had problems with the diet because of his past illnesses: [...] "The food was impossible for me, because I'm allergic to so many different things, so I took two suitcases with me: one of clothes and one of Heinz beans" [...] and eggs. After dinner, the musicians gathered {{on the roof of}} Harrison's bungalow to talk and listen to the Ganges river.
