Cormels pieces of four reported highly Fusarium susceptible Gladiolus cultivars (Friendship, peter pears, Victo Borge and Novalux) formed friable calli when cultured in-vitro on MS basal medium containing 2, 4 -D and BAP. The friable calli of each cultivar established cell suspensions in their respective callus maintenance gelrite free G 2 -medium. One week after the initiation of suspension cultures only few viable cells could be visualized under microscope. At initial stages of suspension cultures, two types of cells were noted. The first cell type consisted of elongated. And with on starch contents. The second type was round in shape and small in size as compared with the first type of cells. Plantlets were regenerated from the all four cultivars of immature <b>cormel</b> slices when the <b>cormel</b> slices went through a cellus phase. Plant regeneration was obtained form the control callus, control cells suspension derived callus, Gamma irradiated callus and in-vitro selected FOG resistant cell-lines of Gladiolus CV-I. Cell suspension or cell suspension derived calli of CV- 4 did not regenerate plants after 36 months. The calli derived from cell suspension with 15 - 30...|$|E
40|$|The {{new cocoyam}} or tannia (Xanthosoma sagittifolium Schott) is an {{important}} starchy staple in the humid tropics, especially various parts of West and Central Africa, where the daughter-corms or cormels are consumed. The young leaves are also utilized as a vegetable or spinach. The latter practice presents a major <b>cormel</b> production constraint as continuous defoliation depresses yield. However, a specialized spinach production system recently developed at the University of Ghana Agricultural Research Station at Kade, Ghana, holds promise in overcoming the problem. Corm-explants or 'microsetts' weighing 5 -l 0 g, are pre-sprouted in fresh, moist, medium-coarse textured sawdust for 3 weeks and are then transplanted in raised beds. These beds are a metre wide, 25 - 30 cm high {{and as long as}} space permits. The plants are spaced at 10 cm x 10 cm intervals and the beds hand-watered as necessary. The plants are defoliated to provide a spinach when the young leaves are available. This system could provide a year-round, diversified income source for small-scale market gardeners as well as serve as a highly lucrative large-scale agri-business venture. Efforts are currently directed to the breeding of specialised genotypes with high leaf turn-over rates and protein contents. The high intensity planting using 100, 000 plants/ha has oresented a new line of thinking as regards the optimum density required for specialized <b>cormel</b> production.

40|$|The {{effect of}} time of spike removal on the {{development}} of corm and <b>cormels</b> in gladiolus plants raised from corms was investigated using cultivar Professor Goudriaan. The onset of corm thickening was correlated with time of spike removal; when the spike was removed early, the onset of corm thickening was hastened. Early removal of the spike advanced the start of corm growth but had little effect on the growth rate. Early spike removal increased the size of corms but differences were small at the normal time of harvesting. Failure to differentiate spikes or their removal just after emergence resulted in a marked {{increase in the number of}} <b>cormels...</b>|$|R
50|$|The typical Xanthosoma {{plant has}} a growing cycle of 9 to 11 months, {{during which time}} it {{produces}} a large stem called a corm, this surrounded by smaller edible <b>cormels</b> {{about the size of}} potatoes. These <b>cormels</b> (like the corm) are rich in starch. Their taste has been described as earthy and nutty, and they are a common ingredient in soups and stews. They may also be eaten grilled, fried, or puréed. The young, unfurled leaves of some varieties can be eaten as boiled leafy vegetables or used in soups and stews, such as the Caribbean callaloo. Flour made from Xanthosoma species is hypoallergenic.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTThis work {{investigated}} the chemical composition of cocoyam corms and <b>cormels</b> {{and the effect}} of processing and particle size on the physicochemical and organoleptic properties of the flours for use as soup thickener. Fresh cocoyam corms and <b>cormels</b> were peeled, sliced, washed, divided into four parts that were variously blanched, sulphited and sulphited/blanched. The control was not treated. The slices were sun dried (32 ± 2 °C, 3 days), milled and classified with standard sieves into particle sizes of 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6 mm. The flour samples and fresh corms and <b>cormels</b> were analyzed for the proximate composition, ascorbic acid, anthocyanin and oxalic acid contents. The flours were also analyzed for the pH, bulk density, water and oil absorption capacities and the sensory properties of colour and texture. On dry weight basis, the protein, fat, crude fibre, ash and carbohydrate contents of the corms, <b>cormels</b> and flours were the same (p> 0. 05). Ascorbic acid, anthocyanin and oxalic acid contents were respectively reduced from averages of 30. 35, 31. 58 and 173. 88 mg/ 100 g (dry weight) in the corm/cormel to ranges of 8. 95 — 16. 28, 9. 58 — 15. 90 and 141. 69 — 160. 68 mg/ 100 g in the flours. Bulk density was increased (p< 0. 05) by blanching and particle size. The water and oil absorption capacities were increased (p< 0. 05) by blanching. Colour preference was improved by sulphiting, blanching and decreasing particle size. Texture preference was only affected by particle size. Acceptablility of soups from flours were not affected by treatments and particle sizes...|$|R
