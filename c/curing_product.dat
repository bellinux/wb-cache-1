One conventionally <b>cured</b> <b>product</b> {{of each type}} was analyzed for the same properties to provide a control for comparison with the organic/natural processed products. The results showed that some natural/organic processed meats are comparable to conventionally <b>cured</b> <b>products</b> but the variation of properties in this group of products was relatively greater than what is typically expected for <b>cured</b> meat <b>products.</b> This means that a better understanding and better processing control of the natural/organic processed meat products is necessary to provide consumers with products of consistent quality and safety...|$|R
50|$|Sweeteners {{and other}} {{flavoring}} agents are {{necessary in the}} production of many <b>cured</b> <b>products</b> due to the harsh flavors of the salt. A number of sweeteners can be used in curing foods, including dextrose, sugar, corn syrup, honey, and maple syrup. Dextrose is seen often in cured meat, as it not only mellows the harshness, but it also increases the moisture content of the <b>cured</b> <b>product</b> while adding less sweetness to the cured meat. The sweeteners also assist in stabilizing the colors in meat and help the fermentation process by giving a nutrient to the bacteria.|$|R

40|$|Life cycle {{assessments}} (LCAs) {{of various}} anchovy (anchoveta) {{direct human consumption}} products processed in Peru were carried out, to evaluate their relative environmental performance as alternative products to enhance nutrition of communities with low access to fish products in the country. LCA was carried out for fresh, frozen, canned, salted and <b>cured</b> anchoveta <b>products,</b> both at plant gate and featuring local and national distribution over non-refrigerated, chilled and fully refrigerated distribution chain. The functional unit used was 1 kg of fish in the final product. Results demonstrate that, in environmental terms, more-refined <b>products</b> (<b>cured</b> and canned anchoveta products) represent a much higher burden than less- refined products (fresh, frozen and salted). Although this is a likely result, {{the magnitude of this}} difference (4 to 27 times when expressed as an environmental single score) is higher than expected and had not been quantified before for salted and <b>cured</b> <b>products,</b> as far as we know. This difference is mainly due to differences in energy consumption between types of <b>products.</b> Furthermore, <b>cured</b> and salted <b>products</b> feature larger biotic resource use, when calculated based on the whole fish equivalent, due to higher processing losses/discards. The relevance of taking into account the different transportation and storage needs is highlighted. For those products requiring refrigerated transportation and storage, over a national distribution chain, those activities increase the overall environmental impacts of the products by 55 % (fresh chilled) to 67 % (frozen). However, such an increase does not worsen the environmental performance of fresh and frozen products in comparison to the energy-intensive canned and <b>cured</b> <b>products.</b> It is concluded that a more sustainability-oriented analysis, including the social and economic pillars of sustainability, is required towards decision-making involving promotion of either product for addressing nutritional deficiencies in Peru...|$|R

Use of water-acetonitrile-trifluoroacetic acid or water-tetrahydrofuran-trifluoroacetic acid linear binary gradients at a flow rate of 3 mL/min, a temperature of 50 degrees C, and UV detection at 280 nm enabled chromatographic analysis of soybean proteins in <b>cured</b> meat <b>products</b> in less than 3 min.

40|$|Abstract. Glycolyzed {{polylactic acid}} (GPLA) -cured {{epoxidized}} natural rubber (ENR) is developed {{for use as a}} toughening agent for PLA resin. GPLA is obtained from chemical recycling of PLA resin by a glycolysis reaction. GPLA-cured ENR is then prepared by the crosslinking reaction of ENR with GPLA in an internal mixer. Chemical structures of the <b>cured</b> <b>products</b> are characterized by solvent fractionation and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The <b>cured</b> ENR <b>products</b> are blended with PLA resin, by varying the cured ENR contents from 5 to 15 % wt.

The cured ENR materials has higher efficiency in improving toughness of PLA resin, compared to uncured ENR, likely due to their rubbery network nature and higher compatibility with the PLA matrix. The incorporation of 5 % wt. GPLA-cured ENR also improves elongation at break with no adverse effect on tensile strength and modulus of PLA...|$|R

40|$|Ultraviolet curable acrylated {{liquid natural}} rubber was {{prepared}} by grafting of photosensitive molecule onto liquid natural rubber for surface coating application. The liquid natural rubber (LNR) was firstly obtained by degradation of natural rubber latex with hydrogen peroxide and cobalt acetylacetonate at 65 oC for 72 hrs.
