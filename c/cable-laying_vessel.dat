Of course, as I have told myself and have told you, there seems no reason to expect a disaster. There are no storms in the quiet depths in which the Dipsey is sailing. Ice does not sink down from the surface, and even if a floating iceberg should turn over, as they sometimes do in the more open sea, the Dipsey will keep low enough to avoid such danger. In fact, I feel almost sure that if she should meet with any obstacle which would prevent her from keeping on her course to the pole, all she would have to do would be to turn around and come back. As to the possibility of receiving no messages, I should conclude in that case that the wire had broken, and should wait a few days before allowing myself to be seriously alarmed. We have provided against such an accident. The Dipsey is equipped as a <b>cable-laying</b> <b>vessel,</b> and if her broken wire is not at too great a depth, she could recover it; but I have given orders that should such an accident occur, and they cannot reestablish communication, they must return." ...|$|E

5000|$|The cable will be 730 km long. [...] It has {{a planned}} {{capacity}} of 1,400 MW. It {{is estimated to}} cost €2 billion and become operational in 2021. [...] The offshore cable will be supplied by Prysmian. The cable will be manufactured at the Arco Felice factory in Naples, Italy, {{and it will be}} installed by the <b>cable-laying</b> <b>vessel</b> Giulio Verne. [...] Cable for the fjord, tunnel and lake sections, and the onshore connection in Norway will be manufactured at the Halden plant in Norway and supplied by Nexans.
