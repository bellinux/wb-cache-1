40|$|Purpose – This paper {{introduces}} the term Branded Marketing Events (BMEs), and examines {{the role of}} its experiential components as a strategic tool for the facilitation of <b>customer</b> brand <b>engagement.</b> This study examines five experiential components of BMEs at events held in Australia and France to determine their respective impact on <b>customer</b> brand <b>engagement.</b> Design/methodology/approach – Surveys were distributed to attendees of ten events by six wine brands in South Australia, and six events in five sub-regions of Bordeaux. Findings - Findings suggest that BMEs influence customers’ brand engagement and brand purchase intention in both Australia and France. However, the experiential components within the events had differing effects. Australian customers were influenced by cognitive, sensorial, and relational experiences and their increased <b>customer</b> brand <b>engagement</b> strongly influenced brand purchase intention. French customers, however, required pragmatic event experiences to build brand engagement. Originality/value - Recognizing their mutual experiential and interactive foundations, this study integrates the research domains of marketing events, customer experiences and <b>customer</b> brand <b>engagement,</b> and contributes to the strategic understanding of how branded event experiences facilitate <b>customer</b> brand <b>engagement...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Social {{media can}} be used not only as public {{relations}} and direct marketing tools but also as communication channels targeting very specific audiences with social media influencers and social media personalities and as effective <b>customer</b> <b>engagement</b> tools. [...] Technologies predating social media, such as broadcast TV and newspapers can also provide advertisers with a fairly targeted audience, given that an ad placed during a sports game broadcast or in the sports section of a newspaper {{is likely to be}} read by sports fans. However, social media websites can target niche markets even more precisely. Using digital tools such as Google Adsense, advertisers can target their ads to very specific demographics, such as people who are interested in social entrepreneurship, political activism associated with a particular political party, or video gaming. Google Adsense does this by looking for keywords in social media user's online posts and comments. It would be hard for a TV station or paper-based newspaper to provide ads that are this targeted (though not impossible, as can be seen with [...] "special issue" [...] sections on niche issues, which newspapers can use to sell targeted ads).|$|E

5000|$|In March 2006, the Advertising Research Foundation {{announced}} the first definition of <b>customer</b> <b>engagement</b> as [...] "turning on a prospect to a brand idea {{enhanced by the}} surrounding context." [...] However, the ARF definition was criticized by some for being too broad. The ARF, World Federation of Advertisers, Nielsen Media Research, IAG Research and Simmons Research {{were in the process}} of developing a definition and a metric for <b>customer</b> <b>engagement.</b> Various definitions have translated different aspects of <b>customer</b> <b>engagement.</b> According to Forrester Consulting's research in 2008, it has defined <b>customer</b> <b>engagement</b> as [...] "creating deep connections with customers that drive purchase decisions, interaction, and participation, over time". Studies by the Economist Intelligence Unit result in defining <b>customer</b> <b>engagement</b> as, [...] "an intimate long-term relationship with the customer". Both of these concepts prescribe that <b>customer</b> <b>engagement</b> is attributed by a rich association formed with customers. With aspects of relationship marketing and service-dominant perspectives, <b>customer</b> <b>engagement</b> can be loosely defined as [...] "consumers' proactive contributions in co-creating their personalized experiences and perceived value with organizations through active, explicit, and ongoing dialogue and interactions". The book, Best Digital Marketing Campaigns In The World, defines <b>customer</b> <b>engagement</b> as, [...] "mutually beneficial relationships with a constantly growing community of online consumers". The various definitions of <b>customer</b> <b>engagement</b> are diversified by different perspectives and contexts of the engagement process. These are determined by the brand, product, or service, the audience profile, attitudes and behaviours, and messages and channels of communication that are used to interact with the customer.|$|E
