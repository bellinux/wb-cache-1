Hence, any computer on the Internet can send a message to any other computer using its IP address. These messages <b>carry</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> the originating computer's IP address allowing for two-way communication. The Internet is thus an exchange of messages between computers.|$|E
5|$|The desecration of the {{two most}} sacred sites of Merina royalty {{represented}} a calculated political move intended to establish the political and cultural superiority of the French colonial power. In the popular view, the link between Ambohimanga and the ancestors (Andrianampoinimerina in particular) rendered the royal city an even more potent symbol and source of legitimate power than the capital of Antananarivo, which was seen as having become a locus of corrupt politics and deviance from ancestral tradition. Believing that the presence of the ancestors within the tombs sanctified the earth upon which the rova was built, Menalamba resistance fighters would come to Ambohimanga to collect handfuls of dirt {{from the base of the}} tombs to <b>carry</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> in their offensives against the French; the French authority intended by the removal of the sovereigns' bodies from the tombs to undermine the fighters' confidence and solidarity. Although the tombs were desecrated and the Menalamba fighters were ultimately defeated, Ambohimanga has retained its sacred character. The royal tombs were reconstructed in 2008 by the government of Madagascar under the Ravalomanana administration. During the 1995 fire that destroyed the tombs and other structures at the Rova of Antananarivo, the lamba-wrapped remains of only one sovereign—Ranavalona III—could be saved from the flames. The queen has since been re-interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga.|$|E

25|$|When in January 1862 {{the newly}} minted Brig. Gen. Sibley led a Confederate brigade into New Mexico Territory and began marching up the Rio Grande toward Colorado, Colonel Canby (subsequently {{promoted}} to brigadier general in March of that year) {{was in charge}} of the defense of the entire territory, which included what is today the states of Arizona and New Mexico as well as the southern tip of Nevada. He assigned to himself the command of Fort Craig, which, at that point, was the southern-most fort in the Confederates' line of march that had not yet been captured. While her husband fought Sibley in the pitched Battle of Valverde, Louisa awaited the outcome of the campaign at Santa Fe, the territorial capital. On March 2, the Confederates captured Albuquerque and eight days later took Santa Fe. The Federal army and territorial government had evacuated the capital, burning or hiding any supplies they were unable to <b>carry</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> to Fort Union, which was northeast of Santa Fe.|$|E
25|$|The Honor System {{has been}} {{run by the}} student body since 1905 and is derived from Robert E. Lee during his tenure as President of the University. Any student found guilty of an Honor Violation {{by his or her}} peers is subject to a single penalty: expulsion. The Honor System is defined and {{administered}} solely by students, and there is no higher review. A formal review, occasionally including referenda, is held every three years to refine the tenets of the Honor System. Students continue to support the Honor System and its single penalty overwhelmingly, and alumni regularly point to the Honor System as one of the distinctive marks they <b>carry</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> from their W experience. W Law students enjoy several distinct benefits from the Honor System. These include more freedom in exam taking as well as an informal account system at the Brief Stop cafeteria in Sydney Lewis Hall. These are balanced by the strict penalty of a violation of the Honor System.|$|E
25|$|When {{the flag}} is paraded {{in front of}} a crowd, those in {{military}} uniform must present a salute according to military regulations. Civilians who are present give the following salute to the national flag: standing at attention (firmes), they raise their right arms and place their right hands on their chests, in front of the heart. The hand is flat and the palm of the hand is facing the ground. This salute is known as the El saludo civil a la Bandera Nacional ("The Civil Salute to the National Flag"). When the President is acting in the capacity of the Head of the Armed Forces, he salutes the national flag with a military salute. When the national anthem is played on television to open or close daily programming, the national flag will be shown at the same time. During certain times of the year, the flag is flown by both civilians and government personnel. Mostly, these events coincide with national holidays and days of significance to the country. During some of these occasions, the flag will be flown at half-mast to honor the death of important Mexicans. These dates are listed in Article 18 of the Law of the National Flag, Arms and Anthem. The national Día de la Bandera (Flag Day) celebration occurs on February 24. On this day in 1821, all the factions fighting in the War of Independence joined together to form the Army of the Three Guarantees in response to the Plan de Iguala, which was signed by Vicente Guerrero and Agustín de Iturbide, declaring Mexico officially an independent country. General Vicente Guerrero was the first military official who swore allegiance to the national flag. Another flag tradition is that before every Olympics in which Mexico is a participant, the President hands a flag over to the flag bearer, chosen by their peers, to <b>carry</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> to the host city.|$|E

500|$|According to Daniel Hoffman, Whitman [...] "is a poet whose {{hallmark}} is anaphora". Hoffman {{describes the}} use of the anaphoric verse as [...] "a poetry of beginnings" [...] and that Whitman's use of its repetition and similarity at the inception of each line is [...] "so necessary as the norm against which all variations and departures are measured...what follows is varied, the parallels and the ensuing words, phrases, and clauses lending the verse its delicacy, its charm, its power". Further, the device allows Whitman [...] "to vary the tempo or feeling, to build up climaxes or drop off in innuendoes" [...] Scholar Stanley Coffman analyzed Whitman's catalogue technique through the application of Ralph Waldo Emersons comment that such lists are suggestive of the metamorphosis of [...] "an imaginative and excited mind". According to Coffman, Emerson adds that because [...] "the universe is the externalization of the soul, and its objects symbols, manifestations of the one reality behind them, Words which name objects also <b>carry</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> the whole sense of nature and are themselves to be understood as symbols. [...] Thus a list of words (objects) will be effective in giving to the mind, under certain conditions, a heightened sense not only of reality but of the variety and abundance of its manifestations." ...|$|E
