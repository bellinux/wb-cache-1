[...] The dean of the UC Irvine School of Law, Erwin Chemerinsky, said, [...] "The liabilities of the corporation are not attributed to the owners, so why should the owners be able to attribute their beliefs to the company?" [...] Several legal scholars wrote an amicus brief to the Supreme Court for this case arguing this danger, while scholars on the other side counter that incorporated non-profit organizations enjoy liability protection despite their activities based on religious or other values/conscience-based causes.|$|E
