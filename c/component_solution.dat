40|$|Earlier {{work has}} shown that when multidimensional scaling (MDS) is applied to item intercorrelations, metric MDS implicitly subtracts the {{standardized}} person mean (SPM) from responses. As a result, when a metric or nonmetric MDS solution is compared to a <b>components</b> <b>solution,</b> the <b>components</b> <b>solution</b> often contains one component with no counterpart among the scaling dimensions. If self-report items form a balanced scale and negatively worded items are not reverse scored, the SPM {{is closely related to}} several concepts of acquiescence and disacquiescence. In this paper, MDS and <b>components</b> <b>solutions</b> are compared using two balanced self-report item sets. In the Likert self-report attitude item set, the MDS and <b>components</b> <b>solutions</b> were essentially the same. In a set of affective well-being items, the <b>components</b> <b>solution</b> contained a general component with no counterpart among the scaling dimensions.

The glycine concentration was in a range between 25 and 180  g/L, and ammonium chloride concentration was between 25 and 200  g/L. The flow rates were around 1  mL/min for glycine and ammonium chloride. The glycine or ammonium chloride (single <b>component)</b> <b>solution</b> was pumped into the column for enough time so as to saturate it completely. For each glycine (or ammonium chloride) liquid phase concentration, three experiments were performed and the average value of the equilibrium concentration in the liquid and solid phases were calculated and used in the presentation of the single-component adsorption isotherm. The experiments were performed at 50 °C and 60 °C.|$|E

30|$|The {{steady flow}} of an isothermal, homogeneous, and {{incompressible}} co-rotational Maxwell fluid is investigated in HSR. The geometry of the problem under consideration gives second order nonlinear coupled differential equations, which are reduced to a single differential equation by using a transformation. A perturbation method is used to obtain analytical expressions for the flow profiles, volume flow rate, shear and normal stresses, shear at wall, forces exerted on the fluid, and the average velocity. The calculations of these values are of great importance during the production process and very useful to obtain the desired quality {{and shape of the}} products. It is noticed that the zeroth <b>component</b> <b>solution</b> matches with the solution of the linearly viscous fluid in HSR and we also found that the net velocity of the fluid is due to the pressure gradient as the expression for the net velocity is free from the drag term. A graphical representation shows that the velocity profiles are strongly dependent on the non-Newtonian parameter and pressure gradients in the x- and z-direction. Thus the extrusion process strongly depends on the parameters involved.|$|E
