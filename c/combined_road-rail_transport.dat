We consider a number of real-world constraints such as multiple transshipments of requests at hubs, transport time limits for requests, request splitting, and outsourcing possibilities. We present a path-based model and solve it with a branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm. Computational experiments show that large realistic instances from a major German rail freight company can be solved close to optimality within one hour on a standard desktop computer, allowing our algorithm to be used for practical planning purposes...|$|R

3000|$|The European Union, {{from its}} {{creation}} as the, {{has had a}} strong tradition of market intervention. In the arena of transport it has previously used directives, which have force of law in all member states, to define air passenger rights in the Passengers Charter for Air Travel: “establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers {{in the event of}} denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights” [17]. In the area of rail freight, the EU began a process towards mandatory quality standards, such as the UIC -Freight Department [37]) authored: “Guide: Quality of rail freight transport”. Also, the European Commission proposal for a regulation of compensation, in cases of non-compliance with contractual quality requirements for rail freight services, eventually led, in 2003, to the industry-led UIC/CER/CIT Freight Quality Charter [9]. Notably, in the latter case, the leading rail client organisation, the International Union of <b>combined</b> <b>Road-Rail</b> <b>transport</b> companies (UIRR), began as supportive of market intervention, but moved to a more liberal position as time progressed. Similarly, the European Commission, transitioning from an interventionist stance, in the 2001 White Paper on Transport [16], to the more laissez-faire approach of the 2006 mid term review [15], looked to researchers to answer the question: “To what extent are specialised, international standards useful for the quality performance of freight logistics in Europe?” [...]...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse the {{implications}} of the urban context for the sustainability performance of intermodal <b>road-rail</b> <b>transport</b> (IRRT). By calculating the external costs of a road transport and an intermodal alternative of consolidated cargo between a freight forwarder's consolidation terminals, the paper shows that the environmental benefits of a modal shift depend on the relative location of the intermodal terminal and shipper and receiver in the spatial structure. A careful integration of the intermodal terminal in the urban spatial structure is therefore a necessity if IRRT is to contribute to the sustainable development of the freight sector...|$|R
40|$|In the {{transportation}} sector {{the issue of}} intermodal transport has grown significantly more important {{over the years and}} is a potential means toward sustainable transportation systems. One important type of user of intermodal transport is less-than-truck load (LTL) service providers. LTL networks often consist of a forwarder and a number of hauliers in a more or less formal organisation. They often work together for many years with the shared strategic purpose to produce transport services, an organisation form that in the construction industry is called a quasifirm. In the relationship between haulier and forwarder the direct mode choice is often made by one of them while they represent different levels of decision-making and hold different responsibilities. Consequently, the forwarder-haulier organisation [...] the quasifirm [...] can be expected to influence the use of intermodal <b>road-rail</b> <b>transport.</b> The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe the business setup between haulier and forwarder as a quasifirm and by means of this concept to outline possible influences on issues important for intermodal <b>road-rail</b> <b>transport.</b> The theory of the quasifirm is presented. To empirically show the existence of the quasifirm in LTL networks, a case study of the forwarder Schenker with their associated hauliers is matched to the theory. The paper establishes the studied forwarder with its associated hauliers as a quasifirm, an organisation form that is proved to have some beneficial characteristics. However, this organisation form also has some less beneficial consequences for the use of intermodal transport...|$|R

The results indicate how local authorities can integrate rail freight in their long-term development plans, and by this create new possibilities for rail freight that are needed {{to in order to}} achieve a sustainable freight transport system in the face of ever-increasing road transport volumes...|$|R
