50|$|Cefoxitin is a second-generation cephamycin {{antibiotic}} {{developed by}} Merck & Co., Inc. from Cephamycin C {{in the year}} following its discovery, 1972. It was synthesized {{in order to create}} an antibiotic with a broader spectrum. It is often grouped with the second-generation cephalosporins. Cefoxitin requires a prescription and as of 2010 is sold under the brand name Mefoxin by Bioniche Pharma, LLC. The generic version of Mefoxin is known as <b>cefoxitin</b> <b>sodium.</b>|$|E
40|$|Two {{simple and}} {{accurate}} methods were developed for quantitative estimation of <b>cefoxitin</b> <b>sodium</b> in presence of its open ring alkali-induced degradation product. The first method {{was based on}} TLC separation of the drug from its alkali-induced degradation product followed by densitometric measurement of the intact drug at 254 Â nm. The proposed method obeys Beerâs law in range (1 â 20 Â Âµg/band). The second method was first derivative (1 D) spectrophotometric method; was based on measurement of amplitude of first order spectra of <b>cefoxitin</b> <b>sodium</b> (in the range of 4 â 36 Â ÂµgÂ mLâ 1) at 282 Â nm which showed zero crossing point of its degradation product. The two methods were validated according to ICH guideline for accuracy, precision and were successfully applied for {{the determination of the}} drug in pure form and pharmaceutical preparation in presence of its alkali-induced degradation product.

40|$|Stability-indicating high {{performance}} liquid chromatography (HPLC) method {{was developed and}} validated for analysis of <b>cefoxitin</b> <b>sodium</b> in its powder for injection dosage form. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a C 18 µBondapack (300 × 3. 9, 10 µ) column, maintained at 30 °C with a mobile phase consisted of water: acetonitrile: glacial acetic acid (800 : 190 : 10) and a flow rate of 0. 9 mL/min. The peak was detected at 254 nm & the retention time was obtained at 16. 74 min. The peak area plot was linear over the concentration range of 72. 16 µg/mL to 451. 04 µg/mL. The different experimental parameters affecting the drug stability were optimized. The method was validated for accuracy, precision, reproducibility, specificity, robustness and ruggedness in accordance with International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines.

40|$|Serum {{creatinine}} and {{creatinine clearance}} were measured in 10 healthy volunteers {{before and after}} an intravenous injection of 2 g <b>cefoxitin</b> <b>sodium.</b> Results were compared with in vitro work which demonstrated a positive interference by cefoxitin in the Jaffé reaction, the routine laboratory method of creatinine measurement. The serum creatinine estimation should be delayed until at least 2 hours after cefoxitin administration. The creatinine clearance {{may appear to be}} falsely high...|$|E
40|$|This {{review paper}} {{establishes}} four major conclusions about cefoxitin sodium: 1. After i. v. administration, cefoxitin is distributed rapidly into the plasma and tissue fluids, {{and has a}} serum half-life of 40 to 60 min. It is not metabolized appreci-ably ( 100 mg/ml) of the salt. The structural formula of <b>cefoxitin</b> <b>sodium</b> is shown in Figure 1.

40|$|A rapid, {{specific}} and precise method is described {{for the analysis}} of cefoxitin in plasma and urine by reversed-phase, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Cefoxitin and the internal standard, 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methyl xanthine are eluted after 5. 3 and 7. 5 min, respectively. The assay sensitivity limit is 1 to 2 mg/l of <b>cefoxitin</b> <b>sodium</b> at 254 nm. Commonly prescribed antibiotics do not interfere.

40|$|<b>Cefoxitin</b> <b>sodium</b> {{was given}} to 30 {{patients}} with various moderate and severe infec-tions. Eighteen of these had impaired immune response resulting from either the primary disease or from concomitant immunosuppressive treatment. The drug was generally well tolerated. Mild toxicity could not be attributed to cefoxitin with certainty. Clinically, the response was excellent, although these patients were severely ill because of infections superimposed on various neoplastic diseases.

40|$|Seven {{patients}} {{considered for}} surgical intervention were among 24 patients treated with <b>cefoxitin</b> <b>sodium.</b> Of the 7, 4 had major bacterial abscesses and cellulitis {{of skin and}} soft tissue that required surgical drainage and debridement; bacteriologic cures were obtained in all 4. The other 3 patients were diabetic and had polymicrobic osteomyelitis of the feet with overlying or contiguous ulcerations with cellulitis, necessitating debridement in addition to cefoxitin therapy; all were cured clinically and bacteriologically without resort to amputation...|$|E
40|$|Intravenous <b>cefoxitin</b> <b>sodium</b> was {{administered}} to 20 patients with moderate to severe infections; 10 patients had undergone surgery. Thirty-eight strains of bacteria, were isolated. Among 8 anaerobes isolated initially, 7 were sensitive to cefoxitin, 5 sensitive to cephalothin; among 17 Gram-negative rods, 15 were sensitive to cefoxitin, 12 to cephalothin. Six bacterial strains resistant to cephalothin proved sensitive to cefoxitin, whereas only 2 strains were resistant to cefoxitin but sensitive to cephalothin. All 20 patients were cured; there were no adverse effects, nor any local reactions at injection sites...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} and toxicity of <b>cefoxitin</b> <b>sodium</b> and cephalothin have been compared {{in a clinical}} study. For 50 patients treated with cefoxitin and 35 treated with cephalo-thin, clinical response was favourable in 86 % and 68 %, respectively. Cephalothin was not effective {{in the treatment of}} anaerobic Gram-negative infections. Cefoxitin was effective in the treatment of septicaemia, osteomyelitis, pulmonary infections, and pyelonephritis caused by cephalothin-resistant organisms. Cefoxitin was also effec-tive in the treatment of infections by the anaerobic pathogen Bacteroides. No major haematologic, hepatic, or renal toxicity was encountered in patients treated with either drug...|$|E
40|$|The {{susceptibility}} {{in vitro}} of 295 strains of anaerobic bacteria to <b>cefoxitin</b> <b>sodium</b> ' and cephalothin {{was determined by}} use of an agar-dilution technique. The strains were isolated from clinical specimens during 1975 and 1976. At 32 /xg/ml or less, cefoxitin inhibited 100 % of Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Fusobacterium spp., anaerobic cocci, and Clostridium perfringens; 91 % of the B. fragilis group, 98 % of other Bacteroides, 96 % of non-spore-forming Gram-positive bacilli, and 64 % of other clostridia. Cephalothin showed similar activity against most of the anaerobes. However, only 18 % of the B. fragilis group and 89 % of other Bacteroides were inhibited by cephalothin at 32 /ig/ml or less, whereas 77 % of clostridia were inhibited by cephalothin at this concentration. It appears that, despite widespread use of cephalosporins, the incidence of organisms resistant to these antibiotics is not increasing...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{clinical}} efficacy and safety of cefmetazole given by IV push with that of parenterally administered cefoxitin for the treatment of endometritis following cesarean delivery. Methods: In a single-blind, multicenter, prospective, randomized study, 355 patients with endometritis after cesarean delivery were enrolled and received medication. Administered was either cefmetazole sodium, 2 g by IV push over I min q 8 h, or <b>cefoxitin</b> <b>sodium,</b> 2 g IV q 6 h in a 2 : 1 ratio. The patients were followed for clinical responses and side effects. Results: The cure rate for cefmetazole was 89 % and for cefoxitin it was 79 % (P 0. 006). The adverse events were similar in both groups. Conclusions: Cefmetazole was significantly more effective than cefoxitin in the treatment of endometritis following cesarean delivery.

40|$|The {{clinical}} {{development programme}} for cefmetazole sodium included over 4000 patients treated by 78 investigators. Cefmetazole therapy was {{compared with that}} of <b>cefoxitin</b> <b>sodium</b> (cefoxitin) for the treatment of urinary tract, skin and soft tissue, lower respiratory, abdominal, and gynaecological infections (with cefoxitin-sensitive pathogens) and for the prevention of postoperative wound infection in patients undergoing surgical procedures. Both cefmetazole and cefoxitin were administered intravenously in all studies. Cefmetazole was as effective as cefoxitin in the treatment of the infections studied. In the surgical wound infection prophylaxis studies, multiple-dose cefmetazole therapy was more effective than multiple-dose cefoxitin therapy in patients undergoing lower gastrointestinal surgery; this difference approached statistical significance. Both multiple-dose and single-dose cefmetazole therapy were as effective as multiple-dose cefoxitin treatment in the other types of surgery studied. Clinical laboratory findings and adverse medical events reported among cefmetazole patients were similar to those observed in patients treated with cefoxitin...|$|E
40|$|Two {{universal}} spectral ranges (4550 – 4100 cm- 1 and 6190 – 5510 cm- 1) {{for construction}} of quantitative models of homologous analogs of cephalosporins were proposed by evaluating the performance of five spectral ranges and their combinations, using three data sets of cephalosporins for injection, i. e., cefuroxime sodium, ceftriaxone sodium and cefoperazone sodium. Subsequently, the proposed ranges were validated by using eight calibration sets of other homologous analogs of cephalosporins for injection, namely cefmenoxime hydrochloride, ceftezole sodium, cefmetazole, <b>cefoxitin</b> <b>sodium,</b> cefotaxime sodium, cefradine, cephazolin sodium and ceftizoxime sodium. All the constructed quantitative models for the eight kinds of cephalosporins using these universal ranges could fulfill the requirements for quick quantification. After that, competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) algorithm and infrared (IR) –near infrared (NIR) two-dimensional (2 D) correlation spectral analysis {{were used to determine}} the scientific basis of these two spectral ranges as the universal regions for the construction of quantitative models of cephalosporins. The CARS algorithm demonstrated that the ranges of 4550 – 4100 cm- 1 and 6190 – 5510 cm- 1 included some key wavenumbers which could be attributed to content changes of cephalosporins. The IR–NIR 2 D spectral analysis showed that certain wavenumbers in these two regions have strong correlations to the structures of those cephalosporins that were easy to degrade...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the use of antibiotic prophylaxis for plastic surgical procedures at our hospital, and to perform a systematic literature review of randomized controlled trials evaluating the use of prophylactic antibiotics in plastic surgery. The records of patients who received plastic surgical procedures with Class I surgical incisions between 2009 and 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. A systematic literature review was conducted for studies examining the use of prophylactic antibiotics for Class I surgical wounds. A total of 13, 997 cases with Class I surgical incisions were included. Prophylactic antibiotics were given in 13, 865 cases (99. 1 %). The antibiotics used were primarily cefuroxime, clindamycin, metronidazole, <b>cefoxitin</b> <b>sodium,</b> and gentamicin. The average duration of administration was 4. 84  ±  3. 07 (range, 1 – 51) days. Antibiotics were administered postoperatively in > 99 % of cases while preoperative antibiotic administration was only given in 32 cases (0. 23 %). Wound infections occurred in 21 cases for an overall infection rate of 0. 15 %. Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria of the systematic review. There was marked variation in the timing of antibiotic administration with antibiotics given pre-, peri-, and postoperatively. Of studies that compared the use of prophylactic antibiotics with placebo, a reduction in wound infections was noted in 4 trials and no difference was noted in 6 trials. No significant difference in infection rates was shown between the prophylactic and postoperative arms. In conclusion, prophylactic antibiotics are overused in plastic surgical procedures. Evidence-based guidelines for the use of prophylactic antibiotics in plastic surgical procedures are needed...|$|E
40|$|Sixteen healthy male volunteers {{participated in}} a randomized, balanced, {{three-way}} crossover study comparing the pharmacokinetics of cefmetazole, cefoxitin, and cefmetazole with probenecid pretreatment. Single 2 -g doses of cefmetazole sodium and <b>cefoxitin</b> <b>sodium</b> were given intravenously as a 5 -min infusion. Concentrations of cefmetazole and cefoxitin were determined by using a specific semiautomated high-performance liquid chromatographic method. Concentration-time profiles of cefmetazole and cefoxitin declined in a biexponential manner from peak levels. Compared with cefoxitin, cefmetazole had a significantly (P less than 0. 05) higher mean (+/- standard error of the mean) peak concentration in serum (290 +/- 11 versus 244 +/- 10 micrograms/ml), a longer terminal disposition half-life (1. 50 +/- 0. 14 versus 0. 81 +/- 0. 04 h), lower systemic clearance (111. 7 +/- 4. 7 versus 279 +/- 12 ml/min) and renal clearance (78. 7 +/- 4. 3 versus 221 +/- 14 ml/min) of intact drug, and a slightly smaller steady-state volume of distribution (10. 3 +/- 0. 21 versus 12. 8 +/- 0. 48 liters). Mean recoveries of cefmetazole and cefoxitin in urine were approximately 71 and 77 %, respectively. Pretreatment of volunteers with probenecid (1 g orally) significantly (P less than 0. 05) increased concentrations of cefmetazole in serum 1 h after drug administration without significantly increasing maximum concentrations in serum. Mean areas under the concentration-time curve (466 +/- 27 versus 295 +/- 13 micrograms. h/ml) and terminal disposition half-lives (2. 27 +/- 0. 13 versus 1. 50 +/- 0. 14 h) of cefmetazole increased. Systemic clearance (72. 1 +/- 4. 0 versus 111. 7 +/- 4. 7 ml/min) and renal clearance (47. 4 +/- 4. 0 versus 78. 7 +/- 4. 3 ml/min) of intact antibiotic decreased. Mean recoveries (65. 9 +/- 3. 7 versus 71. 0 +/- 3. 2 %) of intact cefmetazole in urine were not significantly (P > 0. 05) different. Elimination of cefmetazole in urine was also significantly prolonged by probenecid, with substantial concentrations of cefmetazole (>/= 20 micrograms/ml) found in the 12 - to 24 -h urine collection for 14 to 16 volunteers. The results show that cefmetazole remains at clinically relevant concentrations (1 to 2 micrograms/ml) approximately {{twice as long as}} cefoxitin, that serum cefmetazole can be maintained longer at clinically significant concentrations with preadministration of probenecid, and that cefmetazole is partially eliminated by renal tubule secretion...|$|E
