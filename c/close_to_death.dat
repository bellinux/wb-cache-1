5|$|As time passes, {{with no sign}} of land {{or other}} ships, Parker {{suggests}} that one of them should be killed as food for the others.

A popular and charismatic figure, Bouchard had come <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> from necrotizing fasciitis and lost his left leg. His recovery, and subsequent public appearances on crutches, provided a rallying point for sovereigntists and the public at large. Bouchard thought a proposal lacking a partnership would doom the project among soft nationalists (such as himself) who worried about the economic consequences of separation.|$|E

40|$|To {{understand}} {{the relation between}} fatigue and patients emotional situation {{at the end of}} life, this cross-sectional study aimed to explore the association between multidimensional aspects of fatigue, emotional functioning and quality of life (QoL) in patients with advanced cancer at the end of life. Patients with advanced cancer answered fatigue related measurements (Borg Category Ratio- 10 scale, Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory- 20, Swedish Occupational Fatigue Inventory and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core- 30), when admitted for specialised palliative care. A total of 228 patients with a median length of survival of 63 days were included. In relation to time of survival, fatigue increased <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>death,</b> in both global and multidimensional aspects, as well as the patient’s experience of being sleepy. Marital status was found to affect the experience of fatigue in both global and multidimensional ratings of fatigue. The association between the experience of fatigue and feelings of being tense, worried, irritable or depressed and rated QoL decreased and was not evident <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>death.</b> Fatigue in all dimensions increased, as patients got <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>death.</b> The association between fatigue and both QoL and negative emotions faded away during the last days and weeks of life...|$|R

In 1919, H.D. came <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> when she gave birth to her daughter Frances Perdita Aldington—although the father was not Aldington, but Gray—while suffering from war influenza. During this time, her father, who had never recovered from Gilbert's death, died. In 1919, H.D. wrote one of her few known statements on poetics, Notes on Thought and Vision, which was unpublished until 1982. In this, she speaks of poets (herself included) as belonging to a kind of elite group of visionaries with the power to 'turn the whole tide of human thought'.|$|E

40|$|Purpose To examine symptom prevalence, intensity, and {{association}} with distress {{in patients with}} inoperable lung cancer (LC), using time <b>to</b> <b>death</b> as point of reference. Patients and Methods A consecutive sample of 400 patients completed the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C 30 plus a 13 -item LC-specific scale and the Thurstone Scale of Symptom Distress-Lung Cancer at six time points {{during the first year}} after diagnosis. Patients were divided into subgroups, using data from the time point <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> (2 <b>to</b> 3; > 3 to 6; > 6 to 12; and > 12 months before death) for analysis. Results More than 50 % of patients in all subgroups reported problems related to physical, role, and emotional functioning; fatigue; dyspnea; and cough. In general, functional levels were lower and symptoms higher in subgroups <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>death.</b> Notably, clinically relevant differences were also found in role and social functioning and appetite loss between the two groups furthest from death. A consistent pattern was found among the six subgroups, with breathing, pain, and fatigue rated as the symptoms most associated with distress. Conclusion High prevalence of symptoms was found in all subgroups, with higher intensity in subgroups <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>death,</b> indicating a need for prophylactic and proactive symptom management. Less concordance was found among symptom prevalence, intensity, and {{association with}} distress in subgroups further from death. Future studies should investigate longitudinal associations between symptoms with low intensity and high distress, and examine their clinical implication...|$|R

5|$|One morning, after Tod's {{escape from}} the greyhounds, the Master sends Copper on the hunt. After {{he picks up the}} fox's trail, Copper relentlessly pursues him {{throughout}} the day and into the next morning. Tod finally drops dead of exhaustion, and Copper collapses on top of him, <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> himself. The Master nurses Copper back to health, and both enjoy their new popularity, but after a few months the excitement over Copper's accomplishment dies down. The Master is left alone again, and returns to drinking. He is once again asked to consider living in a nursing home, and this time he agrees. Crying, he takes his shotgun from the wall, leads Copper outside, and pets him gently before ordering him to lie down. He covers the dog's eyes as Copper licks his hand trustingly.|$|E
5|$|After three days' rest, {{they set}} off again, searching for the trail. Eddy {{eventually}} succumbed to his hunger and ate human flesh, but that was soon gone. They began to take apart their snowshoes to eat the oxhide webbing and discussed killing Luis and Salvador for food, before Eddy warned the two men and they quietly left. Jay Fosdick died during the night, leaving only seven members of the party. Eddy and Mary Graves left to hunt, but when they returned with deer meat, Fosdick's body had already been cut apart for food. After several more days—25 since they had left Truckee Lake—they came across Salvador and Luis, who had not eaten for about nine days and were <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>death.</b> William Foster shot the pair, believing that their flesh was the group's last hope of avoiding imminent death from starvation.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, Duncan MacDougall, a {{physician}} from Haverhill, Massachusetts, {{who wished to}} scientifically determine if a soul had weight, identified six patients in nursing homes whose death was imminent. Four were suffering from tuberculosis, one from diabetes, and one from unspecified causes. MacDougall specifically chose people who were suffering from conditions that caused physical exhaustion, as he needed the patients to remain still when they died to measure them accurately. When the patients {{looked like they were}} <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>death,</b> their entire bed was placed on an industrial sized scale that was sensitive within two tenths of an ounce (5.6 grams). On the belief that humans have souls and that animals do not, MacDougall later measured the changes in weight from fifteen dogs after death. MacDougall said he wished to use dogs that were sick or dying for his experiment, though was unable to find any. It is therefore presumed he poisoned healthy dogs.|$|E

50|$|The {{heat and}} {{shortage}} of food {{may have contributed}} <b>to</b> the <b>death</b> of Cardinal Somercotes, although {{the other members of}} the pro-Imperial faction alleged that he had been poisoned.
