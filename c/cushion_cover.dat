50|$|The {{earliest}} known knitted {{items in}} Europe {{were made by}} Muslim knitters employed by Spanish Christian royal families. Their high level of knitting skill {{can be seen in}} several items found in the tombs in the Abbey of Santa María la Real de Las Huelgas, a royal monastery, near Burgos, Spain. Among them are the knitted cushion covers and gloves found in the tomb of Prince Fernando de la Cerda, who died in 1275. The silk <b>cushion</b> <b>cover</b> was knit at approximately 20 stitches per inch. It included knit patterns reflecting the family armory, as well as the Arabic word baraka ("blessings") in stylized Kufic script. Numerous other knit garments and accessories, also dating from the mid-13th century, have been found in cathedral treasuries in Spain.|$|E

50|$|Near {{the end of}} {{the book}} Matron reveals that someone is {{stealing}} food, money and even stamps from her. It is written that Eileen stole the things in order to feed Eddie and apply for a new job. When Eddie does get employed, Eileen and Eddie go to Miss Theobald to confess about the stealing, for they heard that Pauline had been accused of this even though she had been taking money from her mother's bank account (In a short section also Claudine is suspected for stealing, for she suddenly has a lot of money and buys expensive birthday presents, but it turns out that she sold her lovely <b>cushion</b> <b>cover</b> that Mam'zelle showed to everyone at half term to Alison's mother.) Miss Theobald sends Eileen and Eddie into her other room next door, and calls for Matron. She tells her that she knows who stole from her, and asks Matron whether the girl should be expelled or not, since it was Matron who had been stolen from. The unkind Matron insists that the girl should be expelled, and is then lead to Eileen and Eddie. Matron cannot believe her eyes, and then sees the trap she fell into. She leaves St. Clare's at {{the end of the}} year with her children, but Eileen sends a last letter to Alison thanking her for inviting her to eat together at half-term.|$|E
40|$|Effect of an Airbreeze {{mattress}} and <b>cushion</b> <b>cover</b> on sleep quality and comfort in elderly in nursing homes. Katrin Gillis, MScN, RN; Ella Roelant, PhD, MSc; Marianne De Witte, BS Background Insomnia {{is a significant}} problem for older adults and non-pharmacologic measures {{should be considered as}} the first line of therapy in any plan for optimal long-term control. 1 Aim To examine the effect of Airbreeze {{mattress and}} <b>cushion</b> <b>cover</b> as a non-pharmacological interventions on sleep quality and comfort in elderly. Method A randomized interventional study was set up in 3 nursing homes. Only mentally competent residents were included. Demographic, functional and medication characteristics were collected. Total and subtotal quality of sleep was measured by using Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Quality of sleep, comfort, sweating and pain was measured before, after 1 month and after 3 month of implementation of the intervention. In the intervention group, a <b>cushion</b> <b>cover</b> was added after sleeping one month on the mattress cover. Linear mixed models were used for calculating differences in evolution of pain and total mean sleep quality over time. Logistic regression was used to investigate on which parameters the intervention had significant interaction over time. Results Of the 95 residents, 47 received the intervention. There were no differences in demographic, functional and medication characteristics (mean age 85, 0 y; 68 % female; 48 % use of benzodiazepines). Before the intervention {{no significant differences were found}} in sleep quality, comfort, sweating and pain. After implementation, no effect was found on the evolution of pain (p= 0, 596) and total mean sleep quality (p= 0, 716). The intervention had a positive, but weak, interaction over time on comfort (p= 0, 018) and sleep duration (p= 0, 004). Conclusion Despite the small number of participants, a small effect on comfort and sleep duration is shown. Airbreeze mattress and <b>cushion</b> <b>cover</b> may contribute to increase sleep quality of residents in nursing homes as part of a multiple-strategy. 1. 	Mihai C. Teodorescu, MD, Noor F.

40|$|Alpine {{ecosystems}} {{are among those}} biomes that are most vulnerable to climate change. Cushion plants are an important life form of alpine ecosystems and will likely {{play a critical role}} for the resilience of these habitats to climate change. We studied cushion size distribution and different measures of the compactness of cushions (biomass and rosette density, leaf area index) of the cushion plant, Androsace tapete along an elevational gradient from 4500 to 5200 m a. s. l. in the Nyainqentanglha Mountains of the central Tibetan Plateau. Cushion size distribution, total cover, and compactness of cushions varied substantially along the elevational gradient. At the driest site at low elevation we found the lowest total <b>cushion</b> <b>cover,</b> a particularly high proportion of very small cushions, and the most compact cushions (highest rosette and biomass densities, and leaf area index (LAI) per cushion). Our results indicate that in the semi-arid Tibetan Plateau water availability is the more important climate factor than temperature affecting cushion plant traits and morphology...|$|E

40|$|Madhubani {{art of the}} Bihar {{state has}} been {{undergoing}} transition where its application in original composition has been declined owing to social and economic changes now-a-days. There is need to explore possibilities {{for the conservation of}} this art form viz other artistic media for future generations. The reason for using traditional motifs in textiles is to keep our designs or motifs alive. The Indian folk arts with painting play important role in creating new designs. Escalating demands of consumers requires modification in the fashion industry with respect to design, colour, style and technique. So in an effort to add another dimension in the application of Madhubani designs on textiles, the present study was planned. The effort was targeted towards finding the possibility of applying Madhubani designs on textile articles utilizing the hand painting. Madhubani motifs/designs were adapted for center design and border design. Total thirty six motifs / designs were developed keeping in mind their suitability for articles like <b>cushion</b> <b>cover,</b> folder and table cloth. Developed design sheets were subjected to visual evaluation for selection of one best design in each category by the panel of thirty respondents to find out the suitability of the developed designs for hand painting. Finally three articles were prepared by using selected designs and these prepared articles were highly appreciated by the respondents...|$|E
40|$|Photograph of knitted cushion made by Marjorie Bligh. This knitted <b>cushion</b> <b>cover</b> is a {{fine example}} of Marjorie’s skill with a pair of needles. When she was a young mother, she {{preferred}} not to “waste” time by just sitting around breastfeeding. She solved her problem by feeding in an arm chair so she could knit at the same time. (Danielle Wood) “Marjorie Bligh is Tasmania’s queen of the household scene. Often referred to as “Australia’s Mrs Beeton” or “Tasmania’s Mrs Beeton”, she was born Marjorie Pearsall, in 1917, in the Tasmanian midlands township of Ross. In her self-styled career as a housewife superstar, she married three times and produced six books on cooking, home economics, craft, history and gardening. She published her signature household manual under all three of her married names: Marjorie Blackwell, Marjorie Cooper and Marjorie Bligh. A pioneer recycler, Marjorie has for several decades been renowned for her spirited campaign against useful resources being poured into landfill. Famous for never wasting a thing, she has converted thousands of used pantyhose and plastic shopping bags into reusable items.

While most people can manage a <b>cushion</b> <b>cover</b> in Suffolk puffs, Marjorie in her heyday could turn out an entire bedspread. In her autobiography, she recalls: “Early March [1978] I started a quilt that took me 2 ½ months, or 228 hours. First, I cut out 1, 368 rounds of different scrap material using a saucer as a guide, felled the edges, then gathered into a small rosette resembling a miniature shower cap. I then sewed {{one to the other}} – four joins on one rosette. ”(Danielle Wood) “Marjorie Bligh is Tasmania’s queen of the household scene.
