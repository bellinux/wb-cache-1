The first emanated realm to emerge from God's potential Will in Creation is Atziluth, the World of [...] "Emanation". As it is still nullified to Divinity, so not yet considered a self-aware existence, it is the realm where the 10 Sephirot attributes of God are revealed in their essence. In lower spiritual worlds the sephirot also shine, but only in successively lower degrees, concealed through successive contractions and veilings of the Divine vitality. Seven Biblical tzadikim, righteous figures are <b>considered</b> <b>as</b> <b>embodiments</b> of the emotional sephirot of Atzilut: Abraham-Kindness, Isaac-Restraint, Jacob-Mercy, Moses-Endurance, Aaron-Glory, Joseph-Foundation, David-Kingship. While all seven figures are considered supreme Tzadikim, in particular contexts, either Joseph as Yesod, and Moses as inclusive soul of the community, are identified especially as archetypes for the Tzadik in general.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAs a {{controversial}} female {{character of the}} end of the 4 th century AD, Empress Justina suffers a hostile literary tradition, as the sharp quill of Christian authors is always delivering of her a denigrating portrait. Mainly known for her beauty and opposition to the nicean bishop Ambrose of Milan by the years 384 - 386, she is <b>considered</b> <b>as</b> an <b>embodiment</b> of the bad Empress. Scrutinising the contemporary evidence of this confrontation between both the empress and bishop, this study aims to demonstrate how, based on Ambrose’s Letter 20 to his sister Marcellina, in which he compares Justina to Jezabel, the later texts carry out a continuous literary trial against this empress. Therefore, the figure of Justina herself is vanishing behind a topical negative character, shaped by the authors, and continuously validated by a repetition of ever similar clichés...|$|R
40|$|La Mettrie's Homme {{machine is}} still too often <b>considered</b> <b>as</b> the <b>embodiment</b> of «mechanistic materialism » {{inspired}} directly by Descartes. This article demonstrates the error of this interpretation. In particular, the reference to a machine, instead of being an explanatory principle, is shown {{to function as a}} metaphor. Similarly, the use of Cartesian animal spirits, present in La Mettrie's first works, is replaced in L'Homme machine by more dynamic metaphors for the workings of the brain, to account for human creativity. Far from constructing a mechanistic model of man, La Mettrie's sole aim is to demonstrate that a dynamic matter can account for all human activity; he admits ignorance as to the exact workings of this material being.

These have left a unique heritage of interchanging prosperity and destruction, in which the built environment and architecture provide a rich evidence of the many complex identity narratives.   The public function and architecture of the Historical Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina, once purposely built to commemorate the national liberation in World War 2, encapsulates the current situation in the country, which is navigating through a complicated period of reconstruction and transformation after the war in 1990 s. Once <b>considered</b> <b>as</b> the <b>embodiment</b> of a purist Modernist architecture, now a damaged structure with negligible institutional patronage, the Museum shelters the fractured artefacts of life during the three and a half year siege of Sarajevo.

The twenty eight-day festival commences with the 'Neyyattam' ritual on the 'chodi' Day in Edavam (rishabham) and concludes with the Thrikkalashaattu. The Vaisakha Maholsavam celebrations begin with the ritual of bringing a sword from Muthirerikavu from Wayanad. On the following day, on Visakham star Bhandaram Ezhunnallath ritual is held. Gold, Silver vessels, and heavenly ornaments of precious metals and precious stones are brought from the nearby Manathana village to Kottiyoor.An important ritual during the festival is the 'Elaneer Vayppu' or submitting tender coconuts before the swayambhu Shiva linga. On this special day, thousands of tender coconuts carried {{from different parts of}} Malabar by the devotees are submitted. The following day, the main priest of the temple, pours the collected coconut water on to the idol which is known as 'Elaneeraattam'. Rohini Aaradhana is a very important ritual which is not seen in any other temple. Kurumathur Brahman (The senior most member of Kurumathur family <b>considered</b> <b>as</b> the <b>embodiment</b> of Vishnu in the ritual) embraces the swayambhu Shiva linga as part of the ritual. The belief is Vishnu pacifying Shiva who is saddened by the loss of Sati.|$|R

He had Sri Rama with Sita, Lakshmana, Bharata, Satrugana and Hanuman as his personal deity {{and carried them}} in a golden box to all the places where ever he travelled. Sri Thatha Desikan was <b>considered</b> <b>as</b> an <b>embodiment</b> of Truth, Devotion, Supreme Knowledge and Literature.

Sri Thatha Desikan abided to the codes of Vaishnavism and its philosophical values as drafted by the Lineage of Teachers starting from Nammalvar to Swamy Vedanta Desika. Even though Sri Vaishnavism has a broader perspective of having existence from time immemorial, the accountability in this Kali yoga as marked by the Hindu calendar starts with the teachings of Alwars who are the saint-people who {{are believed to be}} sent by Sriman Narayana the Supreme God-Head, to relieve the people of this materialistic world from the glitches of Maya, an equivalent term of illusion. Sri Thatha Desikan was praised and celebrated not only for the great knowledge level of him, but also for being so simple and entirely proud-less, as a person who has done a variety of contributions to the religion of Hinduism - Sri Vaishnavism and to the Sampradhaya (the way) shown by Vedanta Desika.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates some literary {{configurations of}} Beijing through contemporary Chinese literature and films. These configurations are built upon three specific urban spaces (military compound, siheyuan and some modern constructions) by three significant literary groups. The literary groups {{discussed in this}} work are Dayuan wenhua quan (Compound Cultural Group), Dierdai jingweier zuojia (Second-generation Beijing Flavor Writers), and Beipiao diliudai dianyingren (Beijing Floater Sixth-generation Filmmakers). This study adopts a particular methodology. Inspired by Henri Levebvre, it establishes a framework which connecting urban spaces (representations of space), writers and literary productions (representational space). It examines what these urban spaces mean to Chinese writers and filmmakers and how these people thus adopt them to configure particular urban images of Beijing. It argues that these different configurations are actually the projections of those writers and filmmakers' own cultural imaginations, emotional catharsis, and manifest their own cultural positions. "Compound Cultural Group" interprets Beijing as "compound Beijing," which represents revolutionary culture in communist China. Their nostalgia toward the compound in the Cultural Revolution indicates {{the decline of the}} once ruling social group. As for "Second-generation Beijing Flavor Writers", Beijing is a traditional and a masculine city. In their novels, siheyuan is <b>considered</b> <b>as</b> the <b>embodiment</b> of Chinese tradition and Beijing girl is portrayed as masculine women. This imagination fulfills their own cultural appeal to reconstruct traditional values in the "Cultural Fever" in the 1980 s. In the eyes of "Beijing Floater Sixth-generation filmmakers," Beijing is a cosmopolitan metropolis. In their films, this globalized modern city is an urban dream for migrants...|$|R

40|$|The {{advent of}} {{sophisticated}} artificial neural networks has opened new artistic opportunities, {{but also a}} variety of new legal challenges.

However, for the most part the implementation of smart systems has been limited in their reach and scope, and in many instances autonomous agents required quite a lot of direction from the programmer, following a very stringent set of rules. This meant that for the most part all rights, responsibilities and liabilities arising from artificial agents fell squarely on the program creator. Neural networks are different, these systems have the potential to generate works in which human interaction is minimal. Modern copyright law has been drafted to <b>consider</b> originality <b>as</b> an <b>embodiment</b> of the author’s personality, and originality is one of the main requirements for the subsistence of copyright.

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} {{research}} {{with people from}} African, Caribbean and Asian backgrounds regarding perceptions {{and use of the}} English countryside. I explore the complex ways in which the category ‘rural’ was constructed as both essentialised and relational: how the countryside was understood most definitely as ‘not-city’ but also, at the same time, the English countryside was conceived as part of a range of networks: one site in a web of ‘nature places’ across the country, as well as one rural in an international chain of rurals – specifically via embodied and emotional connections with ‘nature’. I argue that alongside sensed/sensual embodiment (the non-representational intuitive work of the body), we need also to <b>consider</b> reflective <b>embodiment</b> <b>as</b> a desire to space/place in order to address the structural socio-spatial exclusions endemic in (rural) England and how they are challenged. I suggest that a more progressive conceptualisation of rurality – a ‘transrural’ open to issues of mobility and desire – can help us disrupt dominant notions of rural England as only an exclusionary white space, and reposition it as a site within multicultural, multiethnic, transnational and mobile social Imaginaries...|$|R

40|$|Incarnate: {{presence}} and vestige in contemporary art practice {{is a body}} of sculptural work presented {{as a series of}} human-scale physical vessels intended for installation in the gallery and other settings. In conjunction with a supporting visual and textual document I utilize these vessels to posit and explore a primary parallel between the Christian concept of The Incarnation and an art process traditionally conceived as creative experience made manifest. My central argument is that the soteriological idea of ‘God made flesh’ corresponds to fundamental artistic aspirations whereby abstract concepts and propositions are rendered as tangible material form. In this way the sculptural work seeks to reflect divine aspirations while also prefiguring mortality, death and the potential for transfiguration. Core concepts of presence, absence, body-space, and trace together with their implicit Christian resonances hold the vessels together as a coherent series of research outcomes. Throughout, the ambiguous entity of the tomb or crypt reappears to trouble the viewer with their own precarious relation to corporeality. It is in this context that Incarnation remains a pivotal paradoxical theme of the thesis: how are we to <b>consider</b> <b>embodiment</b> <b>as</b> a ‘containment of form’ yet also as the miraculous marker of a seemingly always-impossible ‘transcendence’?

The sociality of education as a shared experience {{of learning}} and teaching (Brinkmann 2018) and the materiality of the lived body and of things change the focus from interactions to situations. In situations, the acts of expression and the call or claim of the other/others are either responded to or not responded to.

40|$|This is by {{no means}} an attempt to present an {{exhaustive}} survey of Miltonic criticism. Its purpose is merely to show the chief critical trends in regard to the Satan of Paradise Lost. During the years of Milton criticism, many ideas concerning the man and his epic have been advanced and many discarded. Milton 2 ̆ 7 s Satan has never been a problem in Milton scholarship. Up {{until a few years ago}} perhaps no question received more discussion than Satan 2 ̆ 7 s position in Paradise Lost. Critics are continually on the alert with their ever abounding questions. How did Satan acquire such a heroic standing? What superior force compelled Milton to choose Satan for his hero? What flight of fancy compelled him to endow Satan with such a glamorous figure that the deity, Adam, and Eve were insignificant in comparison? Upon whom did Milton lavish his sympathy? Whom did Milton favor with his admiration in Paradise Lost? Was Milton still inhaling the puritanical air of Cromwell 2 ̆ 7 s reign? These and numerous other perplexing questions perturbed Milton scholars. It is the purpose of the writer to consider the criticism of Milton 2 ̆ 7 s Satan under four heads: first, the works of those critics who <b>consider</b> Satan <b>as</b> the hero of Paradise Lost; second, the works of those critics who <b>consider</b> Satan <b>as</b> an exponent of freedom and liberty; third, the work of those critics who <b>consider</b> Satan <b>as</b> an <b>embodiment</b> of Milton himself; and fourth, the multiportrayalists. In making this division the writer has taken into consideration the critical trend of the centuries the criticism of the neoclassical and the eighteenth century in which classical influence demanded an epic hero; the early nineteenth century in which the romantic demands for freedom and liberty were paramount; that of the later nineteenth century in which the romantic and realistic influence combined; and that of the twentieth century in which the psychological influence demands portrayal of the poet as the hero of his poem...|$|R
