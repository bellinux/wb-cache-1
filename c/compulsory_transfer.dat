Mobility was one of the means available to officers for managing their men and this meant that professional transfers were a frequent occurrence {{in the course of a}} gendarme’s career.

This situation produced a solid set of shared values, the predominating one being the granting of priority based on length of service. Above all, it provided a new forum for discussion and one that was particularly original for such a highly structured military institution. “When you were a gendarme, it was like being a bird on a wire.

50|$|In 1933, Hitler came {{to power}} in Germany, and in 1935 the Nuremberg Laws made German Jews (and later Austrian and Czech Jews) {{stateless}} refugees. Similar rules were applied by the many Nazi allies in Europe. The subsequent growth in Jewish migration and the impact of Nazi propaganda aimed at the Arab world led to the 1936-1939 Arab revolt in Palestine. Britain established the Peel Commission to investigate the situation. The commission did not consider the situation of Jews in Europe, but called for a two-state solution and <b>compulsory</b> <b>transfer</b> of populations. Britain rejected this solution and instead implemented the White Paper of 1939. This planned to end Jewish immigration by 1944 and to allow no more than 75,000 additional Jewish migrants.

30|$|The first {{conclusion}} can {{be justified}} considering the results on the preferences and skills of women and low-caste students. The results show that women, who currently have a 50 percent quota in teacher training in Uttarakhand, are found to have lower skills on average than men. The lower level of female skills that we observe is likely to stem {{from the fact that}} due to the female quota, female applicants have entered the training programme with lower entry scores. 14 The ‘remote village’ location tends to be the least desirable location option, but particularly among the competitively selected students, women are substantially less willing to work in remote locations than men. Given that the starting salary of teachers in Uttarakhand was around 18, 000 rupees, the estimates in Table 4 indicate {{that in the case of}} women in general, a salary increase of 26 – 73 percent would be required to compensate for a posting to a remote village, depending on the alternative location category and origin of the teacher. These estimates suggest that location is a highly important non-monetary component of the overall compensation for teachers in India. Women are also more averse than men towards permanent contracts with than without compulsory rotation, likely to be explained by responsibility for caring for the family. <b>Compulsory</b> <b>transfers</b> could be considered one mechanism to react to shortages of teachers in certain areas.|$|R
40|$|The article characterizes a {{legal status}} of civil {{servants}} falling under the Law of Civil Service Officers of 16 Sept. 1982. The author presents and analyzes basic institutions contained in the Act related to entering, changes and expiry of officers' employment relation {{as well as to}} their rights, duties and responsibilities. New regulation is adopting to some extent the provisions of traditional Civil Service Law which was previously based on the Act of Civil Service of 1922, it is also extending the provisions elaborated in common labor regulations on officers' employment relations arising from an act of appointment. In consequence the status of civil servants has a more mixed character. It is combining the elements of public law (appointment, higher subordination to superiors' discretion, disciplinary responsibility etc.) with the obligational ones (giving up <b>compulsory</b> <b>transfers,</b> possibility of dissolution of an employment contract by an officer, partial access to a recourse to the law). An individual character of legal position of civil servants is particularly manifested in the scope of the so-called collective labor relations (by means of limiting unions' freedoms). In the author's opinion it is an obsolete tendency which is not contributing to the work effectiveness of the Civil Service.

While Zakah helps generate {{a flow of}} funds and recruit the necessary manpower, Waqf provides the material infrastructure and creates a source of revenue for use in, among others, social welfare enhancing activities both at family, community and state levels. This paper discusses the role of Zakah and Waqf institutions in poverty alleviation. The paper is analytical with presentation based on survey of relevant literature {{with a view to}} adding to existing literature and synthesizing opposing views on the socio-economic role of Zakah and Waqf and the process of their revitalisation in the modern time.
