2500|$|A notable exception, {{discovered}} in the early 19th century, {{is the use of}} a gas mantle mounted above the wick on a kerosene lamp. Looking like a delicate woven bag above the woven <b>cotton</b> <b>wick,</b> the mantle is a residue of mineral materials (mostly thorium dioxide), heated to incandescence by the flame from the wick. The thorium and cerium oxide combination produces both a whiter light and a greater fraction of the energy in the form of visible light than a black body at the same temperature would. [...] These types of lamps are still in use today in areas of the world without electricity, because they give a much better light than a simple wick-type lamp does. Recently, a multipurpose lantern that doubles as a cook stove has been introduced in India in areas with no electricity.|$|E

60|$|Such {{a voyage}} left little to spend, and I was soon on the {{look-out}} {{for a fresh}} berth. I shipped this time as mate, in a brig called the William Henry, bound on a smuggling voyage to the coast of Spain. We took in tobacco, segars, &c. &c., and the brig dropped down to Staten Island. Here I quarrelled with the captain about some <b>cotton</b> <b>wick,</b> and I threw up my situation. I knew there were more ships than parish churches, and felt no concern about finding a place in one, up at town. The balance of my advance was paid back, and I left the smuggling trade, like an honest man. I only wish this change of purpose had proceeded from a better motive.|$|E
50|$|Candle wicks are {{normally}} {{made out of}} braided <b>cotton.</b> <b>Wicks</b> are sometimes braided flat, so that as they burn they also curl back into the flame, thus making them self-consuming. Prior {{to the introduction of}} these wicks special scissors were used to trim the excess wick without extinguishing the flame.|$|R

50|$|<b>Cotton</b> <b>wicks</b> {{can be used}} to form weeps. A rope of up to 12 in {{in length}} is placed in the joints. The other end of the rope is {{extended}} up into the cavity wall. The cotton can absorb the moisture inside the wall and wick it to the outside, but the converse is also true - it is possible for the <b>cotton</b> rope to <b>wick</b> a small amount of moisture from the outside to inside the wall. The process of evaporation is slower than with weep holes. Also, the cotton could catch fire.|$|R
60|$|When {{at length}} the cement was cleared {{away and the}} area swept, they discovered--for there ran the line of it--that here a great stone was set into the floor; it must have weighed several tons. As it was set in cement, however, to lift it, {{even if they had}} the {{strength}} to work the necessary levers, proved quite impossible. There remained only one thing to be done--to cut a way through. When they had worked at this task for several hours, and only succeeded in making a hole six inches deep, Mr. Clifford, whose old bones ached and whose hands were very sore, suggested that perhaps they might break it up with gunpowder. Accordingly, a pound flask of that explosive was poured into the hole, which they closed over with wet clay and a heavy rock, leaving a quill through which ran an extemporized fuse of <b>cotton</b> <b>wick.</b> All being prepared, their fuse was lit, and they left the cave and waited.|$|E

50|$|The wicks require routine maintenance. With {{fiberglass}} wicks, the kerosene heater {{is placed}} outdoors {{and allowed to}} operate until it runs out of fuel. Tar and other leftover deposits on the wick are burned off. This should be done {{at least once a}} week if operated 24hr a day. With <b>cotton</b> <b>wicks,</b> the heater must never be run dry to clean the wick. Cleaning is instead accomplished with a paper towel, wiping down the top of the wick to remove any residue. The wick will eventually deteriorate to the point where it will need to be replaced.|$|R

50|$|A {{candle wick}} {{is a piece}} of string or cord that holds the flame of a candle. Commercial wicks are made from braided <b>cotton.</b> The <b>wick's</b> {{capillarity}} determines {{the rate at which the}} melted hydrocarbon is conveyed to the flame. If the capillarity is too great, the molten wax streams down the side of the candle. Wicks are often infused with a variety of chemicals to modify their burning characteristics. For example, it is usually desirable that the wick not glow after the flame is extinguished. Typical agents are ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate.|$|R
5000|$|On this occasion, Lord Vishnu {{is given}} a special place of honour in the sanctum of Kashi Vishwanath temple, a {{prominent}} Shiva temple in Varanasi. The temple is described as Vaikuntha on this day. Both the deities are duly worshipped {{as though they are}} worshipping each other. Vishnu offers tulsi (holy basil) leaves (traditionally used in Vishnu worship) to Shiva, and Shiva in turn offers Bael leaves (traditionally offered to Shiva) to Vishnu, which is taboo otherwise, to each other. Devotees start the pujas after taking baths, fasting for the whole day, and offering akshat ( [...] turmeric mixed rice), sandalwood (Chandan) paste, sacred water of the Ganges, flowers, incense and camphor to both the deities. Then they offer lighted deeps (earthen lamps) and batti (<b>cotton</b> <b>wick)</b> as a special offering for the day.

5000|$|Some common but unrecommended {{practices}} can {{adversely affect}} the Svea’s performance and reliability. For example, when using a wind screen or shield {{other than the}} built-in wind screen (such as the flexible aluminum foil windscreens used with stoves made by Mountain Safety Research), care should be taken not to wrap the windscreen too tightly around the stove because {{this may cause the}} stove to overheat and the fuel tank to over-pressurize. [...] This in turn will cause the pressure-relief valve in the filler cap to open and the over-pressurized gas vapor to escape, which may catch fire and result in a dangerous [...] "flareup" [...] or large fireball. In addition, while the Svea is capable of burning unleaded automobile gasoline, only naphtha or [...] "Coleman fuel" [...] is recommended: Coleman fuel contains rust inhibitors and is specially refined for use in camping stoves, while automotive fuel contains additives that vaporize when burned and leave gumlike deposits behind that causes clogging. [...] The stove should also not be allowed to run dry because doing so will burn or char the <b>cotton</b> <b>wick</b> inside the fuel tank, which will inhibit the wick’s ability to draw fuel to the vaporizing tube.|$|E
5000|$|To {{light the}} stove, {{the fuel tank}} must first be {{pre-heated}} and pressurized by lighting {{a small amount of}} fuel poured into the primer pan or spirit cup (a small well) on top of the tank {{at the base of the}} vaporizer (the vertical stem connecting the fuel tank to the burner). Alternatively, the primer pan can be filled directly from the fuel tank by opening the control valve and warming the fuel tank by holding it in one’s hands. This will increase the pressure in the fuel tank and force a small amount of fuel to trickle out of the burner jet and into the primer pan. [...] The control valve must then be closed before lighting the priming fuel so as to allow pressure to build up in the tank when the exterior fuel begins to heat the tank and the fuel within. The tank can also be pressurized by an optional pump that may be attached to the filler cap, but this is generally not necessary except in extreme cold. Fuel from the tank is fed by a <b>cotton</b> <b>wick</b> inside the tank to the base of the vaporizer. The heat and pressure created by the priming flame vaporizes the fuel inside the vaporizer. When the priming flame is nearly burnt out, the control valve is opened by turning the adjusting key. This allows the vaporized fuel to flow under pressure through the burner jet (a small opening at the base of the burner), where it mixes with oxygen and burns with a blue flame. Adjusting the flow of the vaporized fuel that is forced through the burner jet controls the flame size and heat output. The control valve (a spindle) is threaded in the vaporizer's housing, and as it is opened (by turning the adjusting key) it opens like a faucet (counter-clockwise to open and clockwise to close) and the vaporized fuel flows through the burner jet. Closing the spindle closes the fuel supply. A small plate on the top of the burner (a flame spreader) spreads the flame outwards. The heat generated in the burner and vaporizer maintains the internal pressure in the fuel tank.|$|E
40|$|The thermal {{treatment}} of crop oils was investigated {{with the aim}} to produce a renewable, liquid fuel suitable for use in wick-based lighting systems. Specific objectives include reducing fuel viscosity and improving wickability in traditional flat <b>cotton</b> <b>wicks.</b> Pyrolysis and visbreaking processes were the two methods of {{thermal treatment}} that were studied. Visbreaking was a semi-batch process carried out in a stirred tank reactor at temperatures ranging from 300 to 500 °C. Pyrolysis utilized a continuous system with a mechanically fluidized bed reactor at temperatures ranging from 400 - 650 °C. Initial testing with soybean oil feedstock demonstrated that pyrolysis was the superior process for the application due to its greater severity. Organic liquid yields of up to 93 wt% were observed, with reduction in viscosity as high as 96 %. Wickability of the fuel was greatly improved as demonstrated with dedicated testing. Product yields and properties were heavily reliant on reaction temperature in both processes. Feedstocks representing {{a wide spectrum of}} crop oil composition were tested with pyrolysis. The proportion of saturated chemical bonds was found to {{have a negative impact on}} the product quality at low temperatures. Highly saturated oils required increased temperatures to produce liquid product. Fuels produced from the thermal treatment of crop oils can provide up to 60 wt% in blends with kerosene to produce a successful lamp fuel...|$|R

40|$|Detection of pestiferous Bactrocera {{fruit flies}} (Diptera: Tephritidae) relies largely on {{deployment}} of traps baited with male-specific attractants. Two species in particular, B. dorsalis (Hendel) and B. cucurbitae (Coquillett), pose seri- ous threats to US agriculture, and males {{of these species}} are attracted to methyl eugenol (ME) and cue lure (CL), respectively. At present, these lures are applied as liquids (with naled added as an insecticide) to <b>cotton</b> <b>wicks</b> placed inside Jackson traps, a procedure that entails considerable handling time and potential health risk owing to inadvertent contact with the chemicals. Recent {{studies have demonstrated that}} solid dispensers containing male lures and the toxicant DDVP (dichlorvos) capture as many or more B. dorsalis and B. cucurbitae males as the standard liquid formulation. Owing to registration requirements, deployment of solid dispensers requires the lure and the killing agent be presented in separate devices. The goal {{of this study was to}} compare capture of Bactrocera males between traps baited with the liquid formulation (lure and naled mixed) versus traps baited with solid lure-bearing plugs or wafers and separate DDVP strips (lure and DDVP separate). Field trapping was conducted in various areas of Oahu, Hawaii, using variable amounts of DDVP (0. 09 – 0. 295 g) in the traps with the solid dispensers. In gen- eral, for both B. cucurbitae and B. dorsalis, traps with wafers performed as well as traps with liquids regardless of lure age (fresh or aged 6 weeks), DDVP dose, test location, or lure presentation (ME and CL presented singly or combined). Traps with aged plugs also performed as well as aged liquids for both Bactrocera species under nearly all test conditions. However, in a large proportion of tests, fresh plugs captured significantly fewer males of both species than fresh liquids over the full range of DDVP doses tested. The implications of these findings for Bactrocera detection are discussed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceParasitic wasps are {{prominent}} natural enemies of crop pests. They usually feed on floral resources during the adult stage (nectar, pollen, or honeydew). Extrafloral nectar {{is an alternative}} source of sugar easily accessible to adult parasitoids. We developed an original method of nectar labelling based on the injection of labelled sugar solution into the plant stem in order to analyse the nectar uptake by parasitoids (<b>cotton</b> <b>wick</b> method). This method was used to artificially enrich extrafloral cornflower, Centaurea cyanus L. (Asteraceae), nectar with the stable isotope C- 13. We analysed (1) the transfer of C- 13 from the sugar solution into extrafloral nectaries, (2) the uptake of labelled nectar by parasitoids under laboratory conditions, and (3) {{the ability of the}} method to discriminate, in an oilseed rape (Brassica napus L., Brassicaceae) field, between labelled parasitoids (i. e., those who have fed on labelled cornflowers located adjacent to the field) and unlabelled parasitoids to track parasitoid movements from the margin into the field. The extrafloral nectar of all test plants was C- 13 -labelled. Most (66 %) of the parasitoids were identified as marked after 96 h of exposure to labelled plants in the laboratory. We could also detect labelled parasitoids inside the field, but the detection rate was only 1 %. The experiments clearly demonstrate that the <b>cotton</b> <b>wick</b> method is appropriate to label extrafloral nectar and parasitoids feeding on this labelled nectar. Further research is needed on the amount of labelled extrafloral nectar required to obtain a sufficient marker level to track parasitoid movements in the field...|$|E
40|$|Field, greenhouse, and {{laboratory}} studies {{were conducted with}} the following objectives: (1) develop an efficient extraction and analytical method for determining concentration of major flavonoids in apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) leaves, (2) determine if differences exist in levels of these components in leaves of ten apple cultivars and if these differences explain variation in cultivar susceptibility to spider mites (Acari: Tetranychidae), (3) understand the effects of varying light and nutritional regimes on apple leaf flavonoid levels, (4) assess if the flavonoid phloridzin, when applied to bush bean plants, affects Two Spotted Spider Mite population density, and (5) Determine if summer pruning of mature, field-grown apple trees influences levels of foliar phloridzin. ^ An efficient extraction and HPLC analytical method is presented using commonly available and least toxic solvents and an isocratic HPLC run of short duration allowing calculation of unknown concentrations {{with a high degree}} of accuracy. ^ Different cultivars showed significant differences in mite susceptibility and in phloridzin concentration in leaves. However, phloridzin differences do not appear to explain variation in cultivar susceptibility to spider mites. ^ Greenhouse trials indicated that phloridzin concentration was significantly lower in leaves of potted trees of the four cultivars tested under 70 % shade cloth than under full sun. All cultivars responded similarly to sun or shade in regard to percent dry weight phloridzin. Nutrition treatments appeared to have an effect on phloridzin levels only in 1995. ^ Horticultural bush bean plants (Phaeseolus vulgaris) were either sprayed or injected through a <b>cotton</b> <b>wick</b> with 0. 01 M phloridzin or distilled water, and seeded with 5 gravid female Tetranychus urticae mites.

40|$|Abstract: The {{study was}} done on Jatropha bio fuel stove technology. The study deals with {{comprehensive}} literature review followed by technical modifications. The wick stove proto type designed for kerosene burning was chosen for the study. The concepts for preliminary design and premodifications were drawn {{on the basis of}} observations received during testing of proto type to burn with Jatropha oil. Then final modifications of the wick stove were performed technically to make it compatible with burning Jatropha oil. The proto type after modifications contained 1. 5 liters tank with three supporting stands. It contained wick burning mechanism exposed with loose 10 single rope <b>cotton</b> woven <b>wicks</b> each of diameter 5 - 5. 5 mm arranged in a ring. The length of wick was adjusted to 4. 5 cm so that the jatropha oil can transport upward easily. The multi-wick mechanism allows for air flow to occur around its enclosed stilt barrel configuration. This has the effect of reducing heat transfer to the fuel vessel and reduces the potential fuel loss in the vessel through evaporation. The cooling effect on the stilt wick reduces the transfer of heat to the fuel vessel, and thus the fuel within the fuel vessel remains below the dangerous flashpoint temperature even after long periods of use. Closer {{to the top of the}} enclosed stilt areas become hot during stove use. This has the effect of heating up the air that enters the burning area, thus making the stove more efficient...|$|R
50|$|A wick may be {{inserted}} into the hollow wall, where it will draw fuel upwards closer to the hot parts of the burner. Evaporating fuel from the wick removes heat from the top parts of the burner and subsequently the fuel at the bottom receives less heat. This slows down evaporation through the center while increasing the gas pressure inside the wall, spreading the ring of flame outwards, inwards, or vertically depending on the jet directions, while {{the center of the}} burner produces almost no flame, leading to a more controlled burn and faster starting. Suitable wick materials include fiberglass or <b>cotton</b> cloth. The <b>wick</b> will not burn because the evaporating fuel keeps it cool, and the pressure inside prevents air from entering the hollow until the burner can no longer produce enough gas to support a flame. Cellulose cigarette filters wick fuel efficiently upwards but melt and burn in all but the least powerful designs. Other wick materials in use are Kevlar and other aramid fibers, carbon felt, fiberglass, and even toilet paper.|$|R
