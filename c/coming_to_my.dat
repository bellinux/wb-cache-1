25|$|In 1898, Blue Horse {{became friends}} with the noted artist Elbridge Ayer (E.A.) Burbank while he was visiting the Pine Ridge Agency. Burbank painted sitting portraits of the {{greatest}} Native American leaders, including Geronimo, Sitting Bull, Red Cloud and Chief Joseph. Burbank painted more than 1200 portraits of Native Americans from 125 tribes. At the time, Blue Horse was eighty {{years of age and}} rode each day on his horse to pose for Burbank, who he called “Son of the Shadow-Maker.” Burbank was also an historian and his fond recollections illuminate Blue Horse. “Hardly a day passed without Blue Horse <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> studio to visit me. He would sit down and smoke a little, short, strong pipe and gossip with the other Indians present; all the time he was talking he would be fanning himself with the wing of a turkey. His face usually was painted red, and he wore all the Indian clothes he had, with a single feather on his head. He was a thorough Indian, and extremely kind-hearted. His principal object in life was to try to make others happy around him.” Burbank recorded his stories of Blue Horse.|$|E
500|$|A 36-song double album, The Headphone Masterpiece has overdubbed, {{distorted}} production, and incorporates pop rock, soul, R, and hip hop styles. Music journalist Philip Sherburne {{said that}} it explores British Invasion music on songs such as [...] "Upstarts in a Blowout", synthpop on [...] "The World Is <b>Coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>My</b> Party", and [...] "cheerfully misogynist" [...] hip hop on [...] "Bitch, I'm Broke", but the album's [...] "core is classic soul". Jared Levy from Tiny Mix Tapes called it a neo soul album, while The Fader magazine's Knox Robinson categorized it as lo-fi music.|$|E
500|$|Mojo was {{somewhat}} less enthusiastic, finding the record [...] "at once engaging and aloof", with [...] "its often hamfisted production and errant vocals adding to its ramshackle, rusticated charms". In The A.V. Club, Nathan Rabin said {{the album was}} [...] "musically uneven in the best way", calling it [...] "a brilliant, self-indulgent, kaleidoscopic, contradictory mess". Mitchum from Pitchfork observed [...] "a surplus of uniqueness overshadows a respectable aptitude" [...] and remarked that its [...] "self-indulgence, lack of focus, and unbridled sonic and lyrical crudity" [...] made the album [...] "so frustrating, yet compelling." [...] Village Voice critic Robert Christgau gave the record an honorable mention, citing [...] "Family on Blast", [...] "The World Is <b>Coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>My</b> Party", and [...] "My Woman, My Guitars" [...] as highlights while writing, [...] "just what alt-r needed—loads of ideas, considerable talent, and all the stern self-discipline of a trust fund baby".|$|E

2500|$|Studdard's third album, The Return was {{released}} in October 2006; {{it goes back to}} his R roots, but is different from his previous efforts. [...] Studdard collaborated with the artist Ne-Yo on this album, along with a variety of producers. The single [...] "Change Me" [...] {{was released}} ahead of the album. The Return sold 71,000 copies in its first week to open at number eight on the Billboard 200 album chart, but sales declined rapidly after that, not approaching those of his earlier albums. [...] However, Studdard did have good success on the Urban Contemporary chart with [...] "Change Me" [...] (which reached number one) and its successor [...] "Make Ya Feel Beautiful". Studdard continued to tour, saying he would play a variety of music: [...] "Coming out to my show is like <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> house. I'll play the songs I love. It's like a party. For me, a party has all different types of music happening." ...|$|E

60|$|A time {{of silence}} followed, though {{how long it}} might be I could not exactly tell. Then I heard Captain England speak, the words <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> ears as though from a great distance, because of my condition.|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you tell}} him--from me," [...] said Lady Ongar, [...] "that I {{will take it}} as a {{kindness}} on his part if he will abstain from <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> house. I certainly shall not see him with my own consent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm {{afraid you}} are right. Now, Filippo can be romantic {{for hours at}} a stretch, and, what is worse, he is--but nothing happens to him. But on <b>coming</b> back <b>to</b> <b>my</b> native town after four years, I think it was pardonable.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] he said coolly, [...] "you are <b>coming</b> round <b>to</b> <b>my</b> way of thinking. I {{have been}} assuring you, {{from the very}} first moment we met at the Carlton, that I was not your Leopold--that I was Everard Dominey." ...|$|R

60|$|At these words, I {{observed}} the gentleman more attentively. His laugh <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> remembrance too, I knew {{him to be}} Mr. Quinion, whom I had gone over to Lowestoft with Mr. Murdstone to see, before--it is no matter--I need not recall when.|$|E
60|$|All is {{over with}} him, by this time, thought I at last, when through another week no further {{intelligence}} reached me. But <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> room the day after, I found several persons waiting {{at my door}} in a high state of nervous excitement.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes; I look it. That's {{the reason}} I {{can afford to}} be frank, in <b>coming</b> back <b>to</b> <b>my</b> friends. I knew that with this look in my face I should make my own welcome; and it's cordial even beyond my expectations." ...|$|R
6000|$|As for Miriam, she overflowed with delight. The ocean was grand, but Cobhurst was Cobhurst. [...] "There {{was nothing}} better about my trip than the {{opportunity}} {{it gave me}} of <b>coming</b> back <b>to</b> <b>my</b> home. I never did that before, you know, my children." ...|$|R
