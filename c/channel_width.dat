25|$|Smaller MOSFETs are {{desirable}} for several reasons. The main reason to make transistors smaller is to pack {{more and more}} devices in a given chip area. This results in a chip with the same functionality in a smaller area, or chips with more functionality in the same area. Since fabrication costs for a semiconductor wafer are relatively fixed, the cost per integrated circuits is mainly related {{to the number of}} chips that can be produced per wafer. Hence, smaller ICs allow more chips per wafer, reducing the price per chip. In fact, over the past 30 years the number of transistors per chip has been doubled every 2–3 years once a new technology node is introduced. For example, the number of MOSFETs in a microprocessor fabricated in a 45 nm technology can well be twice as many as in a 65 nm chip. This doubling of transistor density was first observed by Gordon Moore in 1965 and is commonly referred to as Moore's law. It is also expected that smaller transistors switch faster. For example, one approach to size reduction is a scaling of the MOSFET that requires all device dimensions to reduce proportionally. The main device dimensions are the channel length, <b>channel</b> <b>width,</b> and oxide thickness. When they are scaled down by equal factors, the transistor channel resistance does not change, while gate capacitance is cut by that factor. Hence, the RC delay of the transistor scales with a similar factor. While this has been traditionally the case for the older technologies, for the state-of-the-art MOSFETs reduction of the transistor dimensions does not necessarily translate to higher chip speed because the delay due to interconnections is more significant.|$|E

2500|$|Power MOSFETs have a {{different}} structure. As with most power devices, the structure is vertical and not planar. Using a vertical structure, {{it is possible for}} the transistor to sustain both high blocking voltage and high current. The voltage rating of the transistor {{is a function of the}} doping and thickness of the N-epitaxial layer (see cross section), while the current rating is a function of the <b>channel</b> <b>width</b> (the wider the channel, the higher the current). In a planar structure, the current and breakdown voltage ratings are both a function of the channel dimensions (respectively width and length of the channel), resulting in inefficient use of the [...] "silicon estate".

40|$|ABSTRACT-During spring migration, sandhill cranes (Crus canaden-sis) rely on {{the central}} Platte River valley in Nebraska as a staging area to {{replenish}} depleted energy and nutrient reserves. From mid-February to mid-April 1998 - 2001, we conducted ground and aerial surveys of sandhill cranes in the central Platte River valley. Peak numbers of sandhill cranes (121, 000 - 285, 000 cranes) detected during ground sur-veys occurred in mid-March (1998, 2001) or early March (1999, 2000). From 42 % to 55 % of the cranes occurred in cornfields, 26 %- 38 % in lowland grassland, 7 %- 13 % in alfalfa, and 2 %- 12 % in other habitats (soybean, winter wheat, shrub-grassland, upland grassland).
