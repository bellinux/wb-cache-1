These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a <b>clinical</b> <b>assessment</b> by a mental health professional. Symptoms associated with schizophrenia occur along a continuum in the population and must reach a certain severity and level of impairment, before a diagnosis is made.

25|$|Movement and posture {{limitations}} are aspects of all CP types {{and as a}} result, CP has historically been diagnosed based on parental reporting of developmental motor delays such as failure to sit upright, reach for objects, crawl, stand, or walk at the appropriate age. Diagnosis of ADCP is also based on <b>clinical</b> <b>assessment</b> {{used in conjunction with}} milestone reporting. The majority of ADCP assessments now use the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) or the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (formerly the International Classification of Impairments Disease, and Handicaps), measures of motor impairment that are effective in assessing severe CP. ADCP is typically characterized by an individual’s inability to control their muscle tone, which is readily assessed via these classification systems.|$|E
25|$|Currently, all PGD embryos are {{obtained}} by assisted reproductive technology, although {{the use of}} natural cycles and in vivo fertilization followed by uterine lavage was attempted {{in the past and}} is now largely abandoned. In order to obtain a large group of oocytes, the patients undergo controlled ovarian stimulation (COH). COH is carried out either in an agonist protocol, using gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues for pituitary desensitisation, combined with human menopausal gonadotrophins (hMG) or recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), or an antagonist protocol using recombinant FSH combined with a GnRH antagonist according to <b>clinical</b> <b>assessment</b> of the patient’s profile (age, body mass index (BMI), endocrine parameters). hCG is administered when at least three follicles of more than 17mm mean diameter are seen at transvaginal ultrasound scan. Transvaginal ultrasound-guided oocyte retrieval is scheduled 36 hours after hCG administration. Luteal phase supplementation consists of daily intravaginal administration of 600µg of natural micronized progesterone.|$|E

25|$|The National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) is an NHS special health {{authority}} created in July 2001 to improve patient safety within the National Health Service (NHS) by encouraging voluntary reporting of medical errors, conducting analysis and initiating preventative measures.

The NPSA identifies patient safety deficiencies with the input of clinical experts and patients, develops solutions and monitors results of corrections within the NHS. Initiatives and alerts include hand hygiene, information for doctors and patients on steps to reduce risk of error, vaccine safety and disclosure of error to injured patients. In addition, the National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS) allows NHS employees to provide the NPSA with reports anonymously.|$|E
25|$|Screening {{those who}} have neither {{symptoms}} nor risk factors for CKD is not recommended. Those who should be screened include: those with hypertension or history of cardiovascular disease, those with diabetes or marked obesity, those aged > 60 years, subjects with indigenous racial origin, those {{with a history of}} kidney disease in the past and subjects who have relatives who had kidney disease requiring dialysis. Screening should include calculation of estimated GFR from the serum creatinine level, and measurement of urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) in a first-morning urine specimen (this reflects the amount of a protein called albumin in the urine), as well as a urine dipstick screen for hematuria. The GFR (glomerular filtration rate) is derived from the serum creatinine and is proportional to 1/creatinine, i.e. it is a reciprocal relationship (the higher the creatinine, the lower the GFR). It reflects one aspect of kidney function: how efficiently the glomeruli (filtering units) work. But as they make up <5% of the mass of the kidney, the GFR does not indicate all aspects of kidney health and function. This can be done by combining the GFR level with the <b>clinical</b> <b>assessment</b> of the patient (especially fluid state) and measuring the levels of hemoglobin, potassium, phosphate and parathyroid hormone (PTH). Normal GFR is 90-120 mLs/min. The units of creatinine vary from country to country.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjective To {{investigate}} {{whether any of}} 14 serum and urine molecular markers (MMs) used to monitor osteoarthritis (OA) {{would be associated with}} particular clinical end-points. Design Thirty-nine OA patients were bled and urine collected at five time points: at baseline visit and at visits 1, 3, 6 and 12 months later. Twelve clinical measurements were made and the concentrations of each of 14 MMs were determined. Principal component analysis, stepwise linear regression with backward elimination, and logistic regression were used to determine the correlations between MMs and clinical measures. Results Principal component analysis was used to reduce the 12 clinical measurements into three independent clinical clusters: baseline <b>clinical</b> <b>assessments,</b> changes in <b>clinical</b> <b>assessments</b> and signal joint measurements. The 14 MMs were similarly reduced to five MM clusters. Each of the three clinical clusters was correlated with a single but different MM cluster. Baseline <b>clinical</b> <b>assessments</b> were correlated with bone markers typified by hydroxylysyl pyridinoline (HP) crosslinks, swelling of the signal joint was correlated with inflammation markers, especially CRP, and the change in <b>clinical</b> <b>assessments</b> over the 1 year evaluation was correlated with TGFβ 1. There was no correlation between any of the skeletal markers and the clinical measures, a situation which draws attention to the need for a direct assessment of cartilage damage in OA to validate the use of cartilage markers. Conclusions This study demonstrates statistical methodology for analysis of clinical trials using multiple MMs and clinical end-points. The patient numbers are sufficient to test hypotheses of relationships of single MMs such as CRP, TGFβ 1 and HP to clinical measures, but larger clinical trials are needed to validate hypotheses...|$|R
40|$|International audienceObjective From a dataset of <b>clinical</b> <b>assessments</b> and gait analysis, {{this study}} was {{designed}} to determine which of the assessments or their combinations would most influence a low gait index (i. e., severe gait deviations) for individuals with cerebral palsy. Design A retrospective search, including <b>clinical</b> and gait <b>assessments,</b> was conducted from August 2005 to September 2009. Population One hundred and fifty-five individuals with a clinical diagnosis of cerebral palsy (CP) (mean age (SD) : 11 (5. 3) years) were selected for the study. Method Quinlan's Interactive Dichotomizer 3 algorithm for decision-tree induction, adapted to fuzzy data coding, was employed to predict a Gait Deviation Index (GDI) from a dataset of <b>clinical</b> <b>assessments</b> (i. e., range of motion, muscle strength, and level of spasticity). Results Seven rules that could explain severe gait deviation (a fuzzy GDI low class) were induced. Overall, the fuzzy decision-tree method was highly accurate and permitted us to correctly classify GDI classes 9 out of 10 times using our <b>clinical</b> <b>assessments.</b> Conclusion There is an important relationship between clinical parameters and gait analysis. We have identified the main clinical parameters and combinations of these parameters that lead to severe gait deviations. The strength of the hip extensor, the level of spasticity and the strength of the tibialis posterior were the most important clinical parameters for predicting a severe gait deviation...|$|R
