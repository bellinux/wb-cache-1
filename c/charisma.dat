5|$|H to He, Who Am the Only One is {{the third}} album by the British {{progressive}} rock band Van der Graaf Generator. It was released in 1970 on <b>Charisma</b> Records.|$|E
5|$|Pericles' {{manner of}} thought and rhetorical <b>charisma</b> {{may have been in}} part {{products}} of Anaxagoras' emphasis on emotional calm in the face of trouble and skepticism about divine phenomena. His proverbial calmness and self-control are also often regarded as products of Anaxagoras' influence.|$|E
5|$|The group {{went on a}} {{sell-out}} tour of the UK {{immediately following}} the album's release, but had to cancel the first date at the Green Playhouse, Glasgow due to electrical safety issues. The group realised they were substantially in debt and needed better management, so recruited Tony Smith (no relation to <b>Charisma</b> Records boss Tony Stratton-Smith). The tour was filmed by <b>Charisma</b> for a possible cinema release, but {{was rejected by the}} band who felt it was not up to standard. The group returned to the U.S. in December 1973, with three shows at the Roxy in Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|A Trick of the Tail is {{the seventh}} studio album by English {{progressive}} rock band Genesis. It {{was released in}} February 1976 on <b>Charisma</b> Records {{and was the first}} album to feature drummer Phil Collins as lead vocalist following the departure of Peter Gabriel. It was a critical and commercial success in the UK and U.S., reaching No.3 and No.31 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Between 2001 and 2004, Joss Whedon and Jeph Loeb {{developed}} a 4-minute pilot episode for Buffy the Animated Series, which was set during the show's first season. Had the series {{been picked up}} by a network, it would have featured Cordelia (voiced by <b>Charisma</b> Carpenter) in more high-school adventures. Following a 2008 leak of the pilot to YouTube, Loeb expressed some hope that the series may be resurrected in some form.|$|E
5|$|Emerson and Lake {{recruited}} Carl Palmer from Atomic Rooster {{and formed}} Emerson, Lake & Palmer (ELP). In 1971, the posthumous Nice album Elegy was released. It included {{different versions of}} previously released tracks, two being studio versions and two live from the 1969 US tour. Emerson had no involvement with compiling the album, which was done by Jackson, Davison and <b>Charisma</b> Records. The album reached No.5 in the UK.|$|E
5|$|Historian Brian Jones concludes in The Emperor Domitian that {{assessing}} {{the true nature}} of Domitian's personality is inherently complicated by the bias of the surviving sources. Common threads nonetheless emerge from the available evidence. He appears to have lacked the natural <b>charisma</b> of his brother and father. He was prone to suspicion, displayed an odd, sometimes self-deprecating sense of humour, and often communicated in cryptic ways.|$|E
5|$|Mithra: The Mithra are a race {{of hunters}} who live {{alongside}} the Tarutaru in Windurst. They {{are known for their}} energy, curiosity, and their penchant for causing playful mischief. Due to a gender imbalance in their race males are a rarity, and so only female mithra leave the home, making females the only playable gender. Mithra possess high dexterity and agility, but lower HP and <b>charisma.</b> Mithra are cursed with envy.|$|E
5|$|Mother Gothel {{has been}} mostly well {{received}} by film critics, who enjoyed the character's humor, complexity, <b>charisma</b> and showmanship, dubbing her a scene stealer, while praising Murphy's performance enthusiastically. However, some critics felt that Gothel {{was simply too}} passive – a weaker, less intimidating Disney villainess than Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty (1959) and Cruella de Vil from One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961).|$|E
5|$|Since the mid-1970s, {{the beauty}} and <b>charisma</b> of the species have gained wide appreciation, and the sea otter has become an icon of {{environmental}} conservation. The round, expressive face and soft, furry body of the sea otter are depicted {{in a wide variety}} of souvenirs, postcards, clothing, and stuffed toys.|$|E
5|$|So is {{the fifth}} studio album by English singer-songwriter Peter Gabriel, {{released}} on 19 May 1986 by <b>Charisma</b> Records. After working on the soundtrack to the film Birdy (1984), producer Daniel Lanois was invited to remain at Gabriel's home during 1985 {{to work on his}} next solo project. Initial sessions for So consisted of Gabriel, Lanois and guitarist David Rhodes, although these grew to include a number of percussionists.|$|E
5|$|The series {{depicts the}} adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life {{as a high school}} student while {{moonlighting}} as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica finds her mother's old high school records and starts digging into her mother's past, discovering information about the Kane family in the process. Meanwhile, Beaver (Kyle Gallner) proposes a business plan to help Kendall (<b>Charisma</b> Carpenter).|$|E
5|$|Van der Graaf Generator are an English {{progressive}} rock band, {{formed in}} 1967 in Manchester by singer-songwriters Peter Hammill and Chris Judge Smith {{and the first}} act signed by <b>Charisma</b> Records. They did not experience much commercial success in the UK, but became popular in Italy during the 1970s. In 2005 the band reformed, and continue to perform as of 2016.|$|E
5|$|According to {{historian}} Paolo Delogu {{it may be}} that Agnellus' narrative better reflects Lombard {{oral tradition}} than Paul's. In his interpretation, Paul's narrative represents a late distortion of the Germanic myths and rituals contained in the oral tradition. In a telling consistent with Germanic tradition, it would be Helmichis who was seduced by the queen, and by sleeping with him Rosamund would pass Alboin's royal <b>charisma</b> magically to the king's prospective murderer. A symbol of this passage of powers is found in Paul's account of the assassin's entry: Alboin's inability to draw his sword represents here his loss of power.|$|E
5|$|Alexander III of Macedon (356–323BC), {{best known}} as Alexander the Great, was an Ancient Greek king of Macedon who reigned from 336BC until his death. He is widely {{regarded}} as one of the greatest military tacticians and strategists in history, and is presumed undefeated in battle. Renowned for his military leadership and <b>charisma,</b> he always led his armies personally and took to the front ranks of battle. By conquering the Persian Empire and unifying Greece, Egypt and Babylon, he forged the largest empire of the ancient world and effected the spread of Hellenism throughout Europe and Northern Africa.|$|E
5|$|Alexander was erudite and patronized both {{arts and}} sciences. However, {{he had little}} {{interest}} in sports or the Olympic games (unlike his father), seeking only the Homeric ideals of honour (timê) and glory (kudos). He had great <b>charisma</b> and force of personality, characteristics which made him a great leader. His unique abilities were further demonstrated by the inability of any of his generals to unite Macedonia and retain the Empire after his death—only Alexander had the ability to do so.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the game}} begins, each player creates their player {{character}} and records the details (described below) on a character sheet. First, a player determines their character's ability scores, which consist of Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and <b>Charisma.</b> Each {{edition of the}} game has offered differing methods of determining these statistics. The player then chooses a race (species) such as human or elf, a character class (occupation) such as fighter or wizard, an alignment (a moral and ethical outlook), and other features to round out the character's abilities and backstory, which have varied in nature through differing editions.|$|E
5|$|By June, {{the band}} had {{performed}} another Italian tour (the third that year) {{and wanted to}} start recording new material (some of which ended up on Hammill's 1973 solo album Chameleon in the Shadow of the Night). However, the combination of working for too long without a break, combined {{with a lack of}} support from Stratton-Smith and <b>Charisma</b> and continued financial difficulties caused the band to implode, and Hammill left to pursue a solo career in mid-1972.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1906, most {{leaders from}} Azusa Street had spun off to form other congregations, such as the 51st Street Apostolic Faith Mission, the Spanish AFM, and the Italian Pentecostal Mission. These {{missions}} were largely composed of immigrant or ethnic groups. The Southeast United States was a particularly prolific area of growth for the movement, since Seymour's approach gave a useful explanation for a charismatic spiritual climate {{that had already been}} taking root in those areas. Other new missions were based on preachers who had <b>charisma</b> and energy. Nearly all of these new churches were founded among immigrants and the poor.|$|E
5|$|Cordelia Chase is {{a fictional}} {{character}} created by Joss Whedon for the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer; she also appeared on Buffy's spin-off series, Angel. Portrayed by <b>Charisma</b> Carpenter, the character {{appears as a}} series regular {{in the first three}} seasons of Buffy, before exiting the show and becoming a series regular during the first four seasons of Angel. The character made her last television appearance in 2004, appearing as a special guest star in Angels one hundredth episode. Cordelia also appears in both canonical and apocryphal Buffy and Angel material such as comic books and novels.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} decades of the ACLU, Baldwin {{continued}} as its leader. His <b>charisma</b> and energy attracted many supporters to the ACLU board and leadership ranks. Baldwin was ascetic, wearing hand-me-down clothes, pinching pennies, and living on a very small salary. The ACLU was directed by an executive committee, but it was not particularly democratic or egalitarian. The ACLU's base in New York resulted in its being dominated by people from the city and state. Most ACLU funding came from philanthropies, such as the Garland Fund.|$|E
5|$|For {{her role}} as Cordelia Chase, as she {{appeared}} in the television series Angel, <b>Charisma</b> Carpenter has been nominated four times by the Saturn Awards. Carpenter earned back-to-back nominations in 2000 and 2001 for Best Genre TV Supporting Actress and Best Actress on Television, respectively. The actress did not receive any nominations in 2002, but again obtained two back-to-back nominations in 2003 and 2004 for Best Actress in a Television Series and Best Supporting Actress in a Television Series, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In prison, Sideshow Bob calls local right-wing {{talk show}} host Birch Barlow and {{complains}} about being unfairly imprisoned. Barlow and Springfield's residents pressure Mayor Quimby into releasing Sideshow Bob. Sideshow Bob is soon unveiled as the Republican candidate for the Springfield mayoral election. Determined to keep Sideshow Bob from becoming mayor, Bart and Lisa decide to campaign for Mayor Quimby. Unfortunately, due to Sideshow Bob's <b>charisma</b> and Mayor Quimby's drowsy, overmedicated appearance at a televised debate, Sideshow Bob wins the election by a massive margin.|$|E
5|$|In the primary, Tydings faced {{a strong}} {{challenge}} from Congressman Paul Sarbanes, who {{had entered the}} race several months earlier. This head start gave Sarbanes a considerable organizational and monetary advantage, and he had already secured influential endorsements. To fend off Sarbanes, Tydings hoped his name recognition and <b>charisma</b> on television would compensate for Sarbanes' other advantages. He also worked to relabel himself as more fiscally conservative than Sarbanes, since both candidates were seen as liberal.|$|E
5|$|Kyra, {{formerly}} known by her title the Seer, is a fictional character from the American television supernatural drama Charmed, which aired on The WB Television Network (The WB) from 1998 to 2006. The character {{was created by}} executive producer Brad Kern and portrayed by actress <b>Charisma</b> Carpenter. Carpenter was invited on the show after acting with Charmed cast member Holly Marie Combs on the ABC Family television film See Jane Date (2003). The actress' original contract was a guest star role that included three episodes in season seven, with media outlets reporting the possibility of Carpenter becoming a series regular.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln ran for {{election}} as governor {{in his own}} right in 1809, but he was perceived by moderate Federalists as overly partisan and lacked the <b>charisma</b> of Sullivan. His support for Jefferson's economic policy, particularly that of embargoing trade with Great Britain and France (who were then embroiled in the Napoleonic Wars) was costly. Federalists, who had regained control of the Massachusetts legislature in 1808, attacked his statements in support of Jefferson, and he lost the election to Christopher Gore, amid a complete Federalist takeover of the Massachusetts government (the outgoing Jefferson administration's repeal of the embargo before the election notwithstanding).|$|E
5|$|Media {{coverage}} of the movement has focused on popular leaders, such as Hensley, and the deaths of ministers by snakebite have received particular attention. Practitioners of snake handling continue to view Hensley as a great man. Kimbrough recorded a discussion with an advocate of snake handling who dismissed Hensley's personal failings as slanderous fabrications. His advocacy, leadership, and– in particular– his personal <b>charisma</b> were important factors in the advancement of the movement.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad Ilyas, {{the founder}} of Tablighi Jamaat, {{wanted to create a}} {{movement}} that would enjoin good and forbid evil as the Qur'an decreed, as his teacher Rasheed Ahmad Gangohi dreamed of doing. The inspiration for this came during his second pilgrimage to Mecca in 1926. What he lacked in scholarly learning, presence, <b>charisma</b> or speaking ability, he made up for in zeal. He initially tried to establish a network of mosque-based religious schools to educate the Mewati Muslims about Islamic beliefs and practices. Shortly afterwards, he was disappointed with the reality that these institutions were producing religious functionaries, but not preachers.|$|E
5|$|Norman wore {{a variety}} of brightly colored, {{elaborate}} costumes and was often photographed by media while wearing royal-style gowns and wigs and holding a scepter. She stated that her habiliments mirrored the practices of extraterrestrials, whose attire she said was brighter and more radiant than clothing on Earth. At the group's headquarters, she had a gold-colored throne that was decorated with peacock feathers. Her assistants helped shepherd her media image; Kirkpatrick and Tumminia speculate that her <b>charisma</b> was primarily responsible for gaining publicity for the group.|$|E
5|$|Parker next {{performed}} {{in a pair of}} low budget movies: Felon and Tunnel Rats. Despite these early light roles, Parker's onscreen <b>charisma</b> and general je ne sais quoi showed, earning Parker comparisons to Paul Newman. In Felon, Parker played a rookie guard dealing with inner turmoil. In 2008's The Secret Life of Bees, Parker played the good-hearted love interest of Alicia Keys' character. Parker's character has to deal with the challenges of spurned love. The movie was written and directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood based on the book of the same name by Sue Monk Kidd.|$|E
5|$|Promoted by {{the music}} press for a melodic pop-influenced sound, the Strokes {{garnered}} critical acclaim and commercial attention. Is This It was praised for its <b>charisma</b> and rhythm, which often referenced the works of 1970s garage rock bands. The record is considered crucial {{in the development of}} other alternative bands and of the post-millennial music industry. It has featured in several publications' lists of the best albums of the 2000s and of all time.|$|E
5|$|The Hòa Hảo {{initially}} {{engaged in}} large-scale clashes with the Việt Minh in 1945, but by mid-1946 {{the two groups}} had agreed to stop fighting each other and fight the French instead. However, in June 1946, Sổ became estranged from his military leaders and started the Dân Xã (Social Democratic Party). Because of his <b>charisma,</b> the Việt Minh saw Sổ as a threat and assassinated him, leaving the Hòa Hảo leaderless and causing Sổ's military leaders to go their separate ways. The split caused an increase in violence as the various Hòa Hảo factions engaged in conflicts among themselves.|$|E
5|$|The band {{formed at}} Manchester University, but settled in London where they signed with <b>Charisma.</b> They {{went through a}} number of incarnations in their early years, {{including}} a brief split in 1969. When they reformed, they found minor commercial success with The Least We Can Do Is Wave to Each Other (February 1970), and after the follow-up album, H to He, Who Am the Only One (December 1970), stabilised around a line-up of Hammill, organist Hugh Banton, saxophonist David Jackson, and drummer Guy Evans. The quartet subsequently achieved significant success in Italy with the release of Pawn Hearts in 1971.|$|E
5|$|The cast is rounded out by <b>Charisma</b> Carpenter (reprising {{her role}} as Christmas's girlfriend, Lacy), Swedish actress Amanda Ooms as Pilar, {{opposition}} leader in the enslaved village and Nikolette Noel as Sophia, Billy's girlfriend. Bulgarian mixed martial artist Lyubomir Simeonov has a cameo {{as one of the}} Sangs. Tennis pro Novak Djokovic filmed a cameo as himself (after being invited to participate by producer Avi Lerner), but his scenes were cut from the film.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} two main {{characters}} was planned {{since the beginning}} of the game's development. Nomura tried to create a contrast between Laguna's and Squall's occupations; thus, Laguna became a soldier with a light-hearted <b>charisma,</b> and Squall became a reserved mercenary student. The designers intended Laguna to be more similar to the previous protagonists in the series to complement Squall, who is different from previous main characters. Laguna is ranked seventh in Electronic Gaming Monthlys list of the top ten video game politicians.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins with}} {{character}} creation, where the player assigns attribute points (such as strength, intelligence, <b>charisma)</b> to The Nameless One. The Nameless One starts {{the game as}} a fighter, but the player may later change his character class to thief or wizard, with the option to also change back to fighter, after finding corresponding tutors. The player may recruit adventuring companions {{over the course of}} the game; there are seven potential party members, but a maximum of five may accompany the player at any one time. Conversation is frequent among party members, occurring both randomly and during conversations with other non-player characters.|$|E
