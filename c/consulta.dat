5|$|Grand Duchess Marguerite Louise and Dowager Grand Duchess Vittoria vied {{with each}} other for power. The Dowager, after a {{protracted}} battle, triumphed: The Grand Duke assigned his mother the day-to-day administration of the state. Cosimo III commenced his reign with the utmost fervour, attempting to salvage the sinking exchequer and allowing his subjects to petition him for arbitration in disputes. The novelty soon wore off, however. Vittoria, Cosimo having lost his taste for administration, was further empowered by admission to the Grand Duke's <b>Consulta</b> (Privy Council). Marguerite Louise, deprived of any political influence, went about arranging Prince Ferdinando's education and aruing with Vittoria over precedence, which only further encamped Cosimo on his mother's side. In the midst of this, on the first anniversary of Ferdinando II's death, Gian Gastone was born to the grand ducal couple.|$|E

This paper compares the number of dental appointments of each person with the amount of dental appointments in the group, despising the history appoint of the analyzed individual. In order to test empirically if the group effect is important, a model of traditional counting was used, with the introduction of the variable that indicates of group effect, particularly, the model of binomial negative counting for panel with random effects, embracing both the effect of over-dispersion and the time dependence of the use for the same person. The companies were divided into five groups according to their size, as follows: 2 to 20, 21 to 50, 51 to 100, 101 to 200 and more than 200 beneficiaries.

The emergency office visits due to acute crises of bronchial asthma (ACBA) and acute respiratory diseases (ARD) in children and adults were also determined in 2 hospitals of the territory during the same period. The linear multiple correlations between the daily means of the selected meteriological variables, the concentrations of air pollutants registered the same day (synchronic) and the previous day, and the office visits due to ACBA and ADR in children and adults were calculated. The concentrations of SO 2, NO 2 and smoke were lower than the permissible ones, according to the health norms. The concentrations of PM 10 reached risky levels (annual mean 61, 2 µg/m 3). Inverse relations were observed between the synchronic values of temperature, the strength of the wind and the concentrations of smoke, PM 10 and NO 2; as well as between the temperature and the office visits due to ACBA in children and to ADD in adults.

25|$|Ceres was patron and {{protector}} of plebeian laws, rights and Tribunes. Her Aventine Temple served the plebeians as cult centre, legal archive, treasury and possibly law-court; its foundation was contemporaneous {{with the passage}} of the Lex Sacrata, which established the office and person of plebeian aediles and tribunes as inviolate representatives of the Roman people. Tribunes were legally immune to arrest or threat, and the lives and property of those who violated this law were forfeit to Ceres. The Lex Hortensia of 287 BC extended plebeian laws to the city and all its citizens. The official decrees of the Senate (senatus <b>consulta)</b> were placed in Ceres' Temple, under the guardianship of the goddess and her aediles. Livy puts the reason bluntly: the consuls could no longer seek advantage by arbitrarily tampering with the laws of Rome. The Temple might also have offered asylum for those threatened with arbitrary arrest by patrician magistrates. Ceres' temple, games and cult were at least part-funded by fines imposed on those who offended the laws placed under her protection; the poet Vergil later calls her legifera Ceres (Law-bearing Ceres), a translation of Demeter's Greek epithet, thesmophoros.|$|E
25|$|The boila {{were divided}} into inner and outer boilas and it was among their ranks that the holders of the highest {{military}} and administrative posts were selected. Most likely the outer boilas resided outside the capital, while the inner ones were member of the court under the direct influence of the monarch. The bagains were the second-ranking aristocratic class and {{were divided into}} numerous ranks. The presence of two separate nobility classes is further confirmed in the Responsa Nicolai ad <b>consulta</b> Bulgarorum (Responses of Pope Nicholas I to the Questions of the Bulgarians), where BorisI wrote about primates and mediocres seu minores. Another privileged group were the tarkhans, although from the surviving inscriptions {{it is impossible to}} determine whether they belonged to the boilas or to the bagains, or were a separate class. The original Bulgar titles and many of the institutions from the pagan era were preserved after the Christianisation of Bulgaria until the very fall of the First Empire. The beginning of the 9th century was marked with a process of incorporation of both Slavs and Byzantine Greeks in the ranks of the Bulgarian nobility and privileged classes, which increased the power of the monarch that had been previously curtailed by the leading Bulgar aristocratic families. Since that time certain Slavic titles became more prominent, such as župan, and some of them mingled forming titles like župan tarkhan.|$|E
25|$|Within a {{few hours}} of Philip {{ascending}} to the throne, Lerma had been made a royal counsellor by the new king and set about establishing himself as a fully fledged valido, or royal favourite. Lerma, in due course declared a duke, positioned himself as the gateway to the king. All the business of government, Philip instructed, was to arrive in writing and be channeled through Lerma before reaching him. Whilst Philip was not hugely active in government in other ways, once these memoranda, or <b>consulta,</b> had reached him he appears to have been assiduous in commenting on them. Debates in royal councils would now only begin upon the written instruction of the king – again, through Lerma. All members of royal councils were under orders to maintain complete transparency with Lerma as the king's personal representative; indeed, in 1612 the councils were ordered by Philip to obey Lerma {{as if he were the}} king. The degree to which Lerma himself played an active role in government has been disputed. Contemporaries were inclined to see Lerma's hand in every action of government; others have since thought Lerma to have 'neither the temperament nor the energy' to impose himself greatly on the actions of government; still others consider Lerma to have carefully attended only those Councils of State that addressed matters of great importance to the king, creating a space for the wider professionalisation of government that had been lacking under Philip II.|$|E

40|$|CONTEXTUALIZAÇÃO: Desde o relatório final da VIII Conferência Nacional de Saúde em 1986, busca-se a introdução de práticas alternativas de assistência à saúde no âmbito dos serviços públicos de saúde. Porém, apenas em 2006, por meio da Política Nacional de Práticas Integrativas e Complementares, os profissionais não-médicos puderam atuar como acupunturistas no Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS). OBJETIVOS: Descrever a evolução da acupuntura no SUS bem como a inclusão de novos acupunturistas não-médicos. MÉTODOS: Efetuou-se um estudo exploratório e descritivo cuja fonte de dados foi o Sistema de Informações Ambulatoriais (SIA) do SUS, disponibilizado pelo banco de dados do Ministério da Saúde, relativo às <b>consultas</b> em acupuntura {{realizadas}} por médicos e não-médicos entre 1999 e 2007, distribuindo-se os atendimentos segundo cidades e ano do atendimento. Para a análise da tendência temporal do número de atendimentos de acupuntura, foi utilizado o modelo de regressão linear simples, utilizando-se nível de significância de 5 %. RESULTADOS: A análise da tendência temporal revelou um aumento significativo (p> 0, 001) de 1, 1 <b>consultas</b> em acupuntura por 100 mil atendimentos ambulatoriais anualmente registrados entre os anos de 1999 e 2007.

CONCLUSÕES: Há expansão das <b>consultas</b> e do número de cidades que registram acupuntura no SUS no período do estudo. BACKGROUND: Since {{the final}} report of the 8 th National Health Conference in 1986, the introduction of alternative healthcare practices {{within the scope of}} public health services has been sought. However, it was only in 2006, through the National Policy for Complementary and Integrative Practices, that non-medical professionals were allowed to act as acupuncturists within the Brazilian National Health System (SUS). OBJECTIVES: To describe the evolution of acupuncture within SUS and the inclusion of new, non-medical acupuncturists. METHODS: An exploratory descriptive study was conducted on acupuncture consultations provided by physicians and non-physicians between 1999 and 2007. The data source was the SUS Outpatient Information System, which is made available through the Ministry of Health database. Consultations were divided according to city and year. To analyze the temporal trend of the number of acupuncture consultations, a simple linear regression model was used, with a significance level of 5 %. RESULTS: Analysis of the temporal trend showed that there was a significant increase (p< 0. 001) of 1. 1 acupuncture consultations per 100 thousand outpatient examinations recorded annually between 1999 and 2007. There was a significant increase over the last year of the study period. In 2007, 28 % of the acupuncture consultations were recorded by non-medical professionals in 41 cities. CONCLUSIONS: There has been an expansion in the number of acupuncture consultations and in the number of cities that record the use of acupuncture within SUS over the study period...|$|R
25|$|Clodius {{sought to}} become a plebeian tribune {{so that he could}} enjoy the powers of these tribunes to pursue his revenge against Cicero. These powers {{included}} presiding over the plebeian council and propose bills to its vote and the power to veto the actions of the officers of state and the senatus <b>consulta</b> (written opinions of the senate on bills, which were presented for advice and usually followed to the letter). However, Clodius was a patrician and the plebeian tribunate was exclusively for plebeians. Therefore, he needed to be transferred to the plebeian order (transitio ad plebem) by being adopted into a plebeian family. In some letters written in 62 BC, the year after Clodius’s trial, Cicero wrote that Herrenius, a plebeian tribune, made frequent proposals to the plebeian council to transfer Clodius to the plebs, but he was vetoed by many of his colleagues. He also proposed a law to the plebeian council to authorise the comitia centuriata (the assembly of the soldiers) to vote on the matter. The consul Quintus Metellus Celer proposed an identical bill to the comitia centuriata. Later in the year, Cicero wrote that Metellus Celer was ‘offering Clodius ‘a splendid opposition’. The whole senate rejected it. Cassius Dio, instead, wrote that in that year Clodius actually got his transitio ad plebem and immediately sought the tribunate. However, he was not elected due to the opposition of Metellus Celer, who argued that his transitio ad plebem was not done in accordance with tradition because this had to be done according to the lex curiata, which provided that adrogatio should be performed in the comitia curiata. In other words, Metellus Celer argued that the adoption was illegal. Cassius Dio wrote that this ended the episode. During his consulship Caesar effected this transitio ad plebem and had him elected as plebeian tribune with the cooperation of Pompey. Clodius silenced Calpurnius Bibulus when he wanted to make a speech {{on the last day of}} his consulship in 59 BC and also attacked Cicero.|$|E

500|$|In May 1670, {{with the}} death of Grand Duke Ferdinando II, Marguerite Louise became Grand Duchess of Tuscany. The old {{tradition}} of admitting the reigning Grand Duke's mother to the <b>Consulta,</b> or Privy Council, was reinstituted at Cosimo III's accession. Loathing Marguerite Louise for her treatment of Cosimo and herself, Vittoria della Rovere, Cosimo III's mother, ensured that Marguerite Louise was denied membership of the <b>Consulta.</b> Being thus effectively excluded from politics, she was left with nothing else to do but supervise the education of her son the Grand Prince Ferdinando. The Grand Duchess, furious at her exclusion, fought with Vittoria over precedence and demanded entry to the <b>Consulta.</b> Cosimo III sided with his mother. Presumably yet another reconciliation, however brief, took place in the summer of 1670, of which a sign was the birth of the couple's last child, Gian Gastone on 24 May 1671. However, by early 1671, the fighting between Marguerite Louise and Vittoria became so heated that a contemporary remarked that [...] "the Pitti Palace has become the devil's own abode, and from morn till midnight only the noise of wrangling and abuse can be heard". The birth of Gian Gastone on the first anniversary of his grandfather Ferdinando II's death, gave an occasion for the child to receive the name of his other, maternal grandfather, Gaston, Duke of Orléans, who had died in 1660. He was later to be the last Medici Grand Duke of Tuscany.|$|E

As <b>consultas</b> de pré-natal foram garantidas, sendo o número médio ­ 9, 8 <b>consultas</b> por gestante ­ superior aos parâmetros nacionais recomendados. Os indicadores utilizados e desenvolvidos para a avaliação de processo identificaram que o serviço ainda apresenta obstáculos ao acesso organizacional, necessitando, assim, da definição de estratégias que garantam essa diretriz fundamental do SUS. The {{objective of}} this study was to evaluate the prenatal care process referring to the Prenatal Assistance to Low Risk Pregnant Women Program of the University Hospital of Maringá, Paraná State, Brazil. It was made a selection of quality criteria which evaluate the precocity in the process and the adequacy in the number of consultation during prenatal period, measured by the Humanization Program of Prenatal and Birth of the Health Ministry and the adequacy on the use of the prenatal care. The study showed that 44. 5 % of pregnant women started late the prenatal care suggest of the low offer and search to better quality care, which is manifested by spontaneous transference of pregnant women to other services to the program. The prenatal consultations were confirmed and the results showed a mean of 9. 8 consultations per pregnant woman ­ higher than the recommended national parameters. The indicators used and developed to the evaluation of process still present some obstacles to the organizational access and need to define strategies which guarantee this fundamental policy of the Brazilian Unified Health System...|$|R

500|$|The senate's {{ultimate}} authority {{derived from}} the esteem and prestige of the senators. This esteem and prestige was based on both precedent and custom, {{as well as the}} caliber and reputation of the senators. The senate passed decrees, which were called senatus <b>consulta.</b> These were officially [...] "advice" [...] from the senate to a magistrate. In practice, however, they were usually followed by the magistrates. The focus of the Roman senate was usually directed towards foreign policy. Though it technically had no official role in the management of military conflict, the senate ultimately was the force that oversaw such affairs. The power of the senate expanded over time as the power of the legislative assemblies declined, and the senate took a greater role in ordinary law-making. Its members were usually appointed by Roman Censors, who ordinarily selected newly elected magistrates for membership in the senate, making the senate a partially elected body. During times of military emergency, such as the civil wars of the 1st century BC, this practice became less prevalent, as the Roman Dictator, Triumvir or the senate itself would select its members.|$|E

Mancera asked Rodolfo Ríos, then-Attorney General of Mexico City, to take the case. Because of this, he was criticized by Twitter users because of [...] "selectively attending requests from citizens." [...] In November 2013, Mancera announced the increase of the Mexico City Metro fare, from three pesos to five, per travel. According to the Metro operator, Sistema Transporte Colectivo, with the increase the system would use the earnings for several uses, including {{the improvement of the}} infrastructure and maintainment of its 12 lines and its 195 stations. The decision was criticized by sectors of the city population because its increase would represent a [...] "blow up in the economy" [...] of the inhabitants, as the minimum wage in Mexico City [...] is 64.76 pesos, as of January 2013. Mancera announced three opinion poll companies would ask to 7,200 Metro users if the fare should be increased, polling from November 28 to December 2; the respondents represented less than the 1% of the 5.5 million daily users who use the system.

40|$|INTRODUÇÃO: Dados da {{literatura}} sugerem que as taxas de tromboembolismo e sangramento em pacientes com próteses valvares cardíacas mecânicas podem ser muito reduzidas se a terapia anticoagulante for otimizada. OBJETIVOS: Avaliar a ocorrência de complicações em portadores de próteses valvares cardíacas mecânicas submetidos à terapêutica anticoagulante, otimizada por meio de ambulatório especializado. MÉTODOS: Estudou-se a ocorrência de complicações ao longo de 10 anos em 261 pacientes com próteses valvares cardíacas mecânicas, anticoagulados e acompanhados em ambulatório especializado. Esses pacientes foram divididos em dois grupos conforme porcentual de <b>consultas</b> com tempo de protrombina (RNI) dentro do intervalo desejado: G 1 - 0 % a 50, 00 % e G 2 - 50, 01 % a 100 % das <b>consultas.</b> Foram avaliadas as ocorrências de complicações tromboembólicas e hemorrágicas na sua totalidade, ou subdivididas em maiores e menores, de acordo com a gravidade. Os resultados estão apresentados sob forma de estudo atuarial e de frequência linearizada de ocorrência de eventos. RESULTADOS: O estudo atuarial mostrou que, ao longo do tempo, no grupo G 2 (com 50, 01 % a 100 % das <b>consultas</b> com a RNI no intervalo desejado) maior número de pacientes esteve livre da ocorrência de qualquer tipo de evento, de eventos hemorrágicos menores ou da elevação exacerbada da RNI. As frequências linearizadas de ocorrência, em todos os tipos eventos, também foram menores nos pacientes do grupo G 2. CONCLUSÕES: O tempo de permanência dentro do intervalo de anticoagulação desejado está diretamente relacionado com a ocorrência de complicações. Entretanto, mesmo com acompanhamento otimizado por meio de ambulatório especializado, apenas cerca de um terço dos pacientes apresentaram nível de anticoagulação adequado em mais da metade das <b>consultas.</b> BACKGROUND: Published {{data suggest}} that rates of thromboembolism and bleeding, in patients with mechanical heart valve prostheses, can be very small by optimizing current anticoagulant therapy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the occurrence of complications in patients with mechanical heart valve prostheses undergoing anticoagulant therapy optimized through specialized clinics. METHODS: We studied the occurrence of complications over 10 years in 261 anticoagulated patients with mechanical heart valve prostheses, followed in specialized clinics. These patients {{were divided into two}} groups according to percentage of queries with prothrombin time (INR) within the desired range: G 1 - 0 % to 50. 00 % and G 2 - 50. 01 % to 100 % of appointments. We evaluated the occurrence of thromboembolic and bleeding complications in their entirety or subdivided into major and minor, according to gravity. The results are presented in an actuarial study and frequency of occurrence of linear events. RESULTS: The actuarial study showed that, over time, more G 2 (with 50. 01 % to 100 % of the consultations with INR in desired range) more patients were free of the occurrence of any event, of minor bleeding events or the marked increase of RNI. The linearized frequency of occurrence in all types events, were also lower in group G 2. CONCLUSIONS: The period of time that patients that remain within the desired anticoagulation interval has directly relations with occurrence of complications. Even with careful follow-up at a specialized outpatient unit, only approximately one third of the patients showed an adequate anticoagulation level in {{more than half of the}} consultations...|$|R
