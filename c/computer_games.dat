5|$|In 1971, DEC {{employee}} David H. Ahl converted two minicomputer games, Hamurabi and Lunar Lander, {{from the}} FOCAL language to BASIC, partially {{as a demonstration}} of the language on the DEC PDP-8 minicomputer. Their popularity led him to start printing BASIC games in the DEC newsletter he edited, both ones he wrote and reader submissions. In 1973, he released the book 101 BASIC <b>Computer</b> <b>Games,</b> containing descriptions and the source code for video games written in BASIC. The games included were written by both Ahl and others, and included both games original to the language and ported from other languages such as FOCAL. Many of these ports were originally mainframe <b>computer</b> <b>games.</b> 101 BASIC <b>Computer</b> <b>Games</b> was a landmark title in <b>computer</b> <b>games</b> programming, and was a best-selling title with more than 10,000 copies sold—more sales than computers in existence at the time. Its second edition in 1978, titled BASIC <b>Computer</b> <b>Games,</b> was the first million-selling computer book. As such, the BASIC ports of mainframe <b>computer</b> <b>games</b> included in the book were often more long-lived than their original versions or other mainframe <b>computer</b> <b>games.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} 4X games borrowed {{ideas from}} board games and 1970s text-based <b>computer</b> <b>games.</b> The first 4X <b>computer</b> <b>games</b> were turn-based, but real-time 4X games are not uncommon. Many 4X <b>computer</b> <b>games</b> {{were published in}} the mid-1990s, but were later outsold by other types of strategy games. Sid Meier's Civilization is an important example from this formative era, and popularized the level of detail that later became a staple of the genre. In the new millennium, several 4X releases have become critically and commercially successful.|$|E

40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the relationship between}} <b>computer</b> <b>game</b> addiction and <b>computer</b> <b>game</b> usage time, age, gender, BIG- 5 personality, and chronotype. Seven hundred and forty-one adolescents from Turkey responded to questionnaires on these topics. We found that <b>computer</b> <b>game</b> addiction, <b>computer</b> <b>game</b> usage time, and chronotype were related with each other. Evening-oriented, younger, and male students had higher <b>computer</b> <b>game</b> addiction scores than morning-oriented, older, and female students. Furthermore, extraverted and agreeable students reported lower <b>computer</b> <b>game</b> addiction. No significant relationship was observed between students’ <b>computer</b> <b>game</b> addiction scores and openness to experience, conscientiousness. We conclude that evening types may be more prone to <b>computer</b> <b>game</b> addiction than morning types...|$|R

5|$|A common {{criticism}} {{of the game is}} its short length. Episode One takes roughly 4–6 hours to complete, which raises the issue of whether the game justifies its price. <b>Computer</b> <b>Games</b> Magazine argued the futility of reviewing the game due to its episodic nature; as the first part of a three-part story arc, it is difficult to judge it when divorced from the final product. Game Revolution expressed disappointment at a lack of new features such as environments and weapons.|$|E
