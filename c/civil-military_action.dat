50|$|The Force Licorne is {{composed}} of battalion task groups (Groupements Tactiques Interarmes), which comprise infantry, cavalry, transport and logistics, health service, joint <b>civil-military</b> <b>action</b> groups etc. As of 6 February 2007 there were three GTIAs: GTIA 1 in the west, GTIA 2 in the centre, and the 43rd GTIA formed around the 43rd BIMa of the Troupes de Marine in Abijan. The Force also comprises a battalion of the French Army Light Aviation (BATALAT), a logistics battalion (BATLOG), squadrons of the Mobile Gendarmerie (militarised riot police) and Gendarmerie prévôtale (military police), and a troop transport group from the French Air Force.|$|E
30|$|During Global War on Terror Operations, over 3000 American {{soldiers}} have been killed or injured defending CEI (a high-risk/high-impact endeavor) (Nussbaum et al. 2016). “Maneuver, Fires and Effects” (MFE) soldiers at the lowest levels of leadership—the strategic corporals—are an indispensable component of the glocal (global/local) EMMEE. Despite that, currently, there are no case studies explaining through unaltered, genuine information how to apply <b>civil-military</b> <b>action</b> in support of EMMEE during full-spectrum megacity COIN operations—where freedom of movement for civilian reconstruction teams is highly restricted.|$|E
30|$|In 2004, COL Peterson {{came across}} {{an essay in}} foreign affairs on {{building}} entrepreneurial economies. In it, Carl J. Schramm—American economist and former professor of finance and policy at the Johns Hopkins University—wrote that going forward, support for entrepreneurship will be vital to the successful development of the economy (Schramm 2004). Briefly, after the US President announced—in January of 2007 —his “New Way Forward,” COL Peterson and his reconnaissance squadron were ordered “to secure and protect critical areas of Baghdad” (Kagan 2007). Within 6  months, his troops proved that the <b>civil-military</b> <b>action</b> can successfully apply the CBE & HRH 2 I concepts during COIN operations, significantly contributing to the overwhelming success of the surge.|$|E
30|$|The Haifa Street {{case study}} during the Surge of 2007 {{is a clear}} {{illustration}} of how CBE & HRH 2 I {{with the assistance of}} <b>civil-military</b> <b>actions</b> can help in the CEI rehabilitation efforts during megacity COIN Clear and Hold operations—where the freedom of movement for civilian reconstruction teams is highly restricted. This model was soon adopted throughout Karkh, and by 2008, with all the CEI security and operation, Haifa Street, “once {{one of the most dangerous}} places in Baghdad, was bustling with commerce” (Bowen 2008). The process of protecting and restoring CEI, however, would not have been possible without the ultimate sacrifice of 48 warriors of the Arrowhead Brigade. At the end of the deployment, the soldiers of the Arrowhead Brigade were credited with “saving and changing the lives of Iraqi people” (SENATE RESOLUTION 8709 2008).|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{the context}} of the {{stabilization}} phase of modern conflicts, <b>Civil-Military</b> Cooperation <b>actions</b> (CIMIC) and Psychological actions (PSYOPS), which are actions of influence, are essential and take precedence over combat actions. Both types of actions have effects on info-targets and aim at influencing them by generating in them feelings and behaviors. CIMIC projects through CIMIC advertising and PSYOPS through messages diffusion both conducted by Allied forces. In both cases, the effects are propagated from the direct info-targets to the people they are connected to, directly or indirectly, through the social networks they belong to. In this article, we describe CIMIC and PSYOPS actions, we then present the different types of social networks concerned and explain the mechanism that underlies the propagation of effects from people to people in these social networks. Finally, we present the G-DEVS simulation models for the people to people direct propagation of both types of actions. This study is carried out in {{the context of}} the CAPRICORN system, whose goal is to assess psychological effects of combat actions, CIMIC actions and psychological actions...|$|R
30|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{introduce}} a new field of study—of e 3 —that addresses EMMEE, particularly through first-hand observation and investigation. Primary research is used to illustrate that during megacity COIN, protracted/slow high-cost approaches taken independently—without practical grassroots support—will not satisfy the immediate basic needs of the population. When law and order can no longer be enforced by the legitimate government, the rapid <b>civil-military</b> <b>action</b> becomes an integral part of rebuilding CEI within the affected communities. Lieutenant General Robert L. Caslen Jr.—from his own experience in Iraq as commander of the 25 th Infantry Division—recorded that “understanding the infrastructure turned out to be a key component” of successful COIN (Caslen 2010). This echoes the experience of General David H. Petraeus, as commander of the Multi-National Force-Iraq, who wrote that during COIN, soldiers “on the ground at the outset did all that they could with the resources available early on to help the people, to repair the damage done by military operations and looting, to rebuild infrastructure, and to restore basic services as quickly as possible” (Petraeus 2006). Both generals understood that “to confine Soldiers to purely military functions while urgent and vital tasks have to be done, and nobody else is available to undertake them, would be senseless” (Galula 1964).|$|E
