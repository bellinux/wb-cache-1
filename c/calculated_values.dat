5|$|The {{isotopes}} neptunium-235, -236, and -237 are {{predicted to}} be fissile; only neptunium-237's fissionability has been experimentally shown, with the critical mass being about 60kg, only about 10kg {{more than that}} of the commonly used uranium-235. <b>Calculated</b> <b>values</b> of the critical masses of neptunium-235, -236, and -237 respectively are 66.2kg, 6.79kg, and 63.6kg: the neptunium-236 value is even lower than that of plutonium-239. In particular 236Np also has a low neutron cross section. Despite this, a neptunium atomic bomb has never been built: uranium and plutonium have lower critical masses than 235Np and 237Np, and 236Np is difficult to purify as it is not found in quantity in spent nuclear fuel and is nearly impossible to separate in any significant quantities from its parent 237Np.|$|E
5|$|Submarine escape {{training}} led US Navy {{personnel to}} believe that Haldane's allowable supersaturation ratios for fast tissues were unnecessarily conservative, as <b>calculated</b> <b>values</b> indicated that supersaturation in trainees exceeded Haldane's limits, {{but they did not}} develop DCS. A large number (2143) of experimental dives were conducted over 3 years to derive allowable supersaturation ratios for a Haldanian 5 compartment model with compartment half-times of 5, 10, 20, 40 and 70 minutes. Values for critical supersaturation derived from this experimental work were different for each tissue compartment. Values for slow tissues (75 and 40-minute) were close to Haldane's findings, but considerably higher values were found for the fast tissues. These values were so high that the researchers concluded that the 5- and 10-minute tissues were not relevant to the development of DCS. Based on these conclusions, a set of tables was computed which omitted the 5- and 10-minute tissues.|$|E

60|$|As the want of {{agreement}} between calculation and observation must be caused {{in part by}} the paucity of observations, it is worth while to make a larger group, by throwing the six series together, as in Table XXXIII., making a grand total of 965 observations. Their value is not so great as if they were observations taken from that number of different persons, still they are equivalent to a large increase of those already discussed. The six series of observed values were made comparable on equal terms by first reducing them to a uniform PE and then by assigning to M, the point of departure, the value of 0. The results are given in the last column but one, where the orderly run of the observed data is much more conspicuous than it was before. Though there is an obvious want of exact symmetry in the observed values, their general accord with those of the <b>calculated</b> <b>values</b> is very fair. It is quite close enough to establish the general proposition, that we are justified in the conception of a typical form of loop, different for the two thumbs; the departure from the typical form being usually small, sometimes rather greater, and rarely greater still.|$|E

The original value of the check digit is then compared with the <b>calculated</b> <b>value.</b> If the <b>calculated</b> <b>value</b> is 0-9, the check digit must match the <b>calculated</b> <b>value.</b> If the <b>calculated</b> <b>value</b> is 10, the check digit must be X.
