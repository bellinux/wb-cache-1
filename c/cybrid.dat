40|$|In {{this work}} we studied the mitochondrial-associated {{metabolic}} pathways in Huntington's disease (HD) versus control (CTR) <b>cybrids,</b> a cell {{model in which}} the contribution of mitochondrial defects from patients is isolated. HD <b>cybrids</b> exhibited an interesting increase in ATP levels, when compared to CTR <b>cybrids.</b> Concomitantly, we observed increased glycolytic rate in HD <b>cybrids,</b> as revealed by increased lactate/pyruvate ratio, which was reverted after inhibition of glycolysis. A decrease in glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase activity in HD <b>cybrids</b> further indicated decreased rate of the pentose-phosphate pathway. ATP levels of HD <b>cybrids</b> were significantly decreased under glycolysis inhibition, which {{was accompanied by a}} decrease in phosphocreatine. Nevertheless, pyruvate supplementation could not recover HD cybrids' ATP or phosphocreatine levels, suggesting a dysfunction in mitochondrial use of that substrate. Oligomycin also caused a decrease in ATP levels, suggesting a partial support of ATP generation by the mitochondria. Nevertheless, mitochondrial NADH/NAD(t) levels were decreased in HD <b>cybrids,</b> which was correlated with a decrease in pyruvate dehydrogenase activity and protein expression, suggesting decreased tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) input from glycolysis. Interestingly, the activity of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, a critical enzyme complex that links the TCA to amino acid synthesis and degradation, was increased in HD <b>cybrids.</b> In accordance, mitochondrial levels of glutamate were increased and alanine was decreased, whereas aspartate and glutamine levels were unchanged in HD <b>cybrids.</b> Conversely, malate dehydrogenase activity from total cell extracts was unchanged in HD <b>cybrids.</b> Our results suggest that inherent dysfunction of mitochondria from HD patients affects cellular bioenergetics in an otherwise functional nuclear background...|$|R

The P 29 mtΔ <b>cybrids</b> expressed enhanced glycolysis, but did not express ROS overproduction and high metastatic potential, whereas P 29 mtA 11 <b>cybrids</b> showed enhanced glycolysis, ROS overproduction, and high metastatic potential.

40|$|In a {{previous}} study, we generated transmitochondrial P 29 mtSAMP 1 <b>cybrids,</b> which had nuclear DNA from the C 57 BL 6 (referred to as B 6) mouse strain-derived P 29 tumor cells and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) exogenously-transferred from the allogeneic strain SAMP 1. Because P 29 mtSAMP 1 <b>cybrids</b> did not form tumors in syngeneic B 6 mice, we proposed that allogeneic SAMP 1 mtDNA suppressed tumor formation of P 29 mtSAMP 1 <b>cybrids.</b> To test this hypothesis, current study generated P 29 mt(sp) B 6 <b>cybrids</b> carrying all genomes (nuclear DNA and mtDNA) from syngeneic B 6 mice by eliminating SAMP 1 mtDNA from P 29 mtSAMP 1 <b>cybrids</b> and reintroducing B 6 mtDNA. However, the P 29 mt(sp) B 6 <b>cybrids</b> did not form tumors in B 6 mice, {{even though they}} had no SAMP 1 mtDNA, suggesting that SAMP 1 mtDNA is not involved in tumor suppression. Then, we examined another possibility of whether SAMP 1 mtDNA fragments potentially integrated into the nuclear DNA of P 29 mtSAMP 1 <b>cybrids</b> are responsible for tumor suppression. We generated P 29 H(sp) B 6 <b>cybrids</b> by eliminating nuclear DNA from P 29 mt(sp) B 6 <b>cybrids</b> and reintroducing nuclear DNA with no integrated SAMP 1 mtDNA fragment from mtDNA-less P 29 cells resistant to hygromycin in selection medium containing hygromycin. However, the P 29 H(sp) B 6 <b>cybrids</b> did not form tumors in B 6 mice, even though they carried neither SAMP 1 mtDNA nor nuclear DNA with integrated SAMP 1 mtDNA fragments. Moreover, overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and bacterial infection were not involved in tumor suppression. These observations suggest that tumor suppression was caused not by mtDNA with polymorphic mutations or infection of cytozoic bacteria but by hypothetical heritable cytoplasmic elements other than mtDNA from SAMP 1 mice...|$|R

Untreated HD <b>cybrids</b> did not exhibit significant modifications in the activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I-IV or in mtDNA sequence variations suggestive of a primary role in mitochondrial susceptibility in the subpopulation of HD carriers studied. However, a slight decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and increased formation of intracellular hydroperoxides was observed in HD <b>cybrids</b> under basal conditions. Furthermore, apoptotic nuclei morphology and a moderate increase in caspase- 3 activation, as well as increased levels of superoxide ions and hydroperoxides were observed in HD <b>cybrids</b> upon 3 -NP or STS treatment. 3 -NP-evoked apoptosis in HD <b>cybrids</b> involved cytochrome c and AIF release from mitochondria, which was associated with mitochondrial Bax translocation.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{pathogenic}} mitochondrial DNA mutations has, in most cases, {{relied on the}} production of transmitochondrial <b>cybrids.</b> Although the procedure to produce such <b>cybrids</b> is well established, it is laborious and cumbersome. Moreover, the mechanical enucleation procedure is inefficient and different techniques have to be used depending on the adherence properties of the cell. To circumvent these difficulties, we developed a chemical enucleation method that can have wide applicability {{for the production of}} transmitochondrial <b>cybrids.</b> The method is based on the use of actinomycin D to render the nuclear genome transcription/replication inactive and unable to recover after treatment. Such treated cells are fused to cells devoid of mitochondrial DNA and selected for the presence of a functional oxidative phosphorylation system. Our results showed that 95 % of the clones recovered by this procedure are true transmitochondrial <b>cybrids.</b> This method greatly facilitates the production of transmitochondrial <b>cybrids,</b> thereby increasing the number of mtDNA mutations and the recipient cell types that can be studied by this system...|$|R

Cellular respiration, oxidative stress, mitochondrial membrane potential and morphology were evaluated employing oxygraph, mitochondria-specific fluorescence staining and evaluation by FACS, and immunocytochemistry. HPLC-electrochemical detection, quantitative RT-PCR and Blue Native PAGE were employed respectively for assays of serotonin, mitochondrial ATPase 6 / 8 subunits levels and complex V activity. ResultsSignificantly low cellular and mitochondrial respiration, ATPase 6 / 8 transcripts levels, mitochondrial complex V activity and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and elevated oxidative stress were observed in ADHD <b>cybrids.</b> Expression of monoamine oxidizing mitochondrial enzymes, MAO-A and MAO-B levels remained unaffected.

40|$|The {{expression}} of insulin receptors and insulin action was studied in cell hybrids and <b>cybrids</b> produced by fusion of the BWIJ mouse hepatoma cell line with nucleated and enucleated mouse L-cells (LEA- 2 A) respectively. The BWIJ parent and the <b>cybrids</b> expressed {{high numbers of}} insulin receptors, whereas the hybrids resembled the L-cell parent with low numbers of receptors. Likewise, the hybrids resembled the LEA- 2 A cells {{with high levels of}} glycogen synthase, whereas the BWIJ cells and <b>cybrids</b> had much lower levels. Both parents, the <b>cybrids,</b> and the hybrids, expressed insulin stimulation of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid influx, but the dose-response curves indicated an increased insulin sensitivity in the cells with the higher receptor concentration. Insulin also stimulated 86 Rb+ uptake in the hepatoma parent, hybrids and <b>cybrids,</b> but not in the L-cell parent. These data suggest that insulin receptors, like other hepatoma-specific properties, behave as a 'luxury function' of the hepatoma cell line and are extinguished when the hepatoma cell is fused with a less differentiated cell type. The biological activities associated with insulin action, on the other hand, are much more complex in their expression and probably the result of the interaction of multiple factors that vary in their expression in cell hybrids and <b>cybrids...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{mammalian}} species, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) with pathogenic mutations that induce {{mitochondrial respiration}} defects {{has been proposed}} {{to be involved in}} tumor phenotypes via induction of enhanced glycolysis under normoxic conditions (the Warburg effects). However, because both nuclear DNA and mtDNA control mitochondrial respiratory function, it is difficult to exclude the possible contribution of nuclear DNA mutations to mitochondrial respiration defects and the resultant expression of tumor phenotypes. Therefore, it is important to generate transmitochondrial <b>cybrids</b> sharing the same nuclear DNA background but carrying mtDNA with and without the mutations by using intercellular mtDNA transfer technology. Our previous studies isolated transmitochondrial <b>cybrids</b> and showed that specific mtDNA mutations enhanced tumor progression as a consequence of overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This study assessed whether mtDNA mutations inducing ROS overproduction always enhance tumor progression. We introduced mtDNA from senescence-accelerated mice P 1 (SAMP 1) into C 57 BL/ 6 J (B 6) mice-derived Lewis lung carcinoma P 29 cells, and isolated new transmitochondrial <b>cybrids</b> (P 29 mtSAMP 1 <b>cybrids)</b> that overproduced ROS. The inoculation of the <b>cybrids</b> into B 6 mice unexpectedly showed that mtDNA from SAMP 1 mice conversely induced tumor suppression. Moreover, the tumor suppression of P 29 mtSAMP 1 <b>cybrids</b> in B 6 mice occurred as a consequence of innate immune responses of the host B 6 mice. Enzyme pretreatment experiments of P 29 mtSAMP 1 <b>cybrids</b> revealed that some peptides encoded by mtDNA and expressed on the cell surface of P 29 mtSAMP 1 <b>cybrids</b> induce increased IL- 6 production from innate immune cells (dendritic cells) of B 6 mice, and mediate augmented inflammatory responses around the tumor-inoculated environment.

40|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain reveals {{high rates}} of oxygen {{consumption}} and oxidative stress, altered antioxidant defences, increased oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids, and elevated transition metal ions. Mitochondrial dysfunction in AD is perhaps relevant to these observations, as such may contribute to neurodegenerative cell death through the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) {{and the release of}} molecules that initiate programmed cell death pathways. In this study, we analyzed the effects of beta-amyloid peptide (A 03 B 2) on human teratocarcinoma (NT 2) cells expressing endogenous mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), mtDNA from AD subjects (AD <b>cybrids),</b> and mtDNA from age-matched control subjects (control <b>cybrids).</b> In addition to finding reduced cytochrome oxidase activity, elevated ROS, and reduced ATP levels in the AD <b>cybrids,</b> when these cell lines were exposed to A 03 B 2 1201340 we observed excessive mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization, increased cytoplasmic cytochrome c, and elevated caspase- 3 activity.

The mutant <b>cybrids</b> had reduced activity of cytochrome c oxidase, significantly lower ATP level and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. However, endogenous levels of reactive oxygen species were very similar in all <b>cybrids</b> regardless of whether they carried the mtDNA defects or not. Furthermore, the <b>cybrids</b> were insensitive to the nitrosative and/or nitrative stress produced by either DETA-NO or SIN- 1 alone.

The mutant <b>cybrids</b> were significantly more sensitive to these insults compared with the wt controls. Ultrastructural examination of dying cells revealed several characteristic features of autophagic cell death. We concluded that nitrosative and/or nitrative stress alone were insufficient to trigger cytotoxicity in these cells, but cell death was observed with a combination of metabolic and nitrative stress.

50|$|A {{cytoplasmic hybrid}} (or <b>cybrid,</b> a {{portmanteau}} {{of the two}} words) is a eukaryotic cell line produced by the fusion of a whole cell with a cytoplast.
