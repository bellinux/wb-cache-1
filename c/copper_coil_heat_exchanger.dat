This configuration offers a high compact structure and a high overall heat transfer coefficient; hence helical <b>coil</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> are widely used in industrial applications. Convective heat transfer between a surface and the surrounding fluid in a <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> has been a major issue and a topic of study in the recent years.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the relative advantage of using a helically <b>coiled</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> against a straight tube <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> It is found that the heat transfer in helical circular tubes is higher as compared to Straight tube due to their shape. Helical coils offer advantageous over straight tubes due to their compactness and increased heat transfer coefficient. The increased heat transfer coefficients are a consequence of the curvature of the coil, which induces centrifugal forces to act on the moving fluid, resulting in the development of secondary flow. The curvature of the coil governs the centrifugal force while the pitch (or helix angle) influences the torsion to which the fluid is subjected to the centrifugal force results in the development of secondary flow. Due to the curvature effect, the fluid streams in the outer side of the pipe moves faster than the fluid streams in the inner side of the pipe. In current work the fluid to fluid heat exchange is taken into consideration. Most of the investigations on heat transfer coefficients are for constant wall temperature or constant heat flux.

40|$|M. Ing. The {{two-phase}} {{heat transfer}} and pressure drop coefficients of pure R 22, the mixtures 80 % R 22 / 20 % R 142 b and 60 % R 22 / 40 % R 142 b within a helix <b>coiled</b> tube-in-tube <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> {{are presented in}} this study. Experimental data was presented {{in the form of}} average heat transfer coefficient and two-phase friction factor. Comparison of the experimental heat transfer coefficient with the predicted values obtained from the Jung, Murata and Thome methods confirms a good accuracy of these methods although they were developed for the straight tube-in-tube <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> The predicted two-phase friction factor values obtained from the Martinelli correlation deviates more than 50 % from the experimental results for the three working fluids. This confirms that the Martinelli method is not accurate enough for the helix <b>coiled</b> tube-in-tube <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this work, we {{experimentally}} study {{heat transfer}} from exhaust particulate air of detergent spray drying tower to water by using <b>coiled</b> tube <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> Water flows in the coiled tubes, where air loaded with detergent particles of 43 micrometers in diameter flows within the shell. Four coiled tubes with different coil pitches {{are used in}} a counter-current flow configuration. We investigate heat transfer coefficients of {{inside and outside the}} heat transfer surfaces through 400 experiments. The correlations between Nusselt number and Reynolds number, Prandtl number, mass flow rate of particulates to mass flow rate of air ratio and coiled tube pitch parameter are proposed. The correlations procured can be used to predicted heat transfer between tube and shell of the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> Keywords—Shell and <b>coiled</b> tube <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger,</b> Spray drying tower, Heat transfer coefficients.

40|$|Kaltim Parna Industri, (KPI), {{experienced}} severe fouling on {{the flue}} gas {{side of the}} <b>coil</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers.</b> This happened on the outer tube side, which some were finned tubes. Although the cause had not clearly been identified, laboratory analysis indicated that the fouling had similar composition with the firebrick. Therefore, preliminary assumption of what causes the problem was firebrick erosion that was carried away by flue gas flow. In order to completely eliminate fouling source and hopefully to reduce cleaning frequency, we planned to coat combustion chamber with special high temperature resistance coating. The result was promising that the material was stable against high temperature and even further helped the operation...|$|R
