40|$|Grain {{handling}} and storage costs have increased dramatically due to recent increases in commodity prices, labor rates, and utility costs. A typical elevator’s interest costs {{have more than}} doubled during the last year (Anderson) while commercial electricity costs have increased almost 19 % during the last five years and are forecast to continue to increase at a similar rate (EIA). In order to establish adequate margins on grain sales and contracts and to set appropriate storage fees, managers need accurate information on grain handling costs. Unfortunately, many mangers rely on outdated rules of thumb rather than accurate measurements of handling costs. This study provides information on grain handling costs at country elevators. Previous Research Research on grain {{handling and}} storage costs is limited. A 1983 study (Schnake and Stevens) provides engineering-based handling cost estimates for various sizes of corn and soybean and wheat and sorghum elevators. Schnake and Steven’s model suggests substantial economies of scale in per-bushel handling costs. For <b>corn</b> and soybean <b>elevators,</b> the estimated per-bushel handling cost ranges from $ 0. 270 /bushel fo...|$|R
40|$|The {{entry of}} the United States into World War II {{augmented}} {{the necessity of}} utilizing agriculture 2 ̆ 7 s resources to the fullest extent in meeting increased food demands with reduced supplies of labor. One of the principal means of expanding production under such conditions is by fuller use of available farm machinery. Unfortunately, however, when a state of national emergency was declared in May, 1941, little was known either about the utilization of Iowa farm machinery or about the numbers of various types of machines available on the farms. To provide the needed information a survey was conducted in August and September of 1941 {{with the cooperation of}} the Work Projects Administration and the Agricultural Marketing Service. Information was collected in August from 2, 911 farms regarding corn planters, grain binders, grain drills, double disks, single disks, hay loaders, manure spreaders, mowers, plows, rakes, rollers, seeders, spike harrows and spring tooth harrows.

40|$|Corn price diHerentials among country {{elevators}} often exceed {{norms of}} perfect competition. Identification of causal factors may suggest remedial policy decisions. This {{study indicates that}} the variables of seasonal adjustments, local demand and supply conditions, availability of transportation facilities, and government loan rate are significant influences in price variation. Key words: price diHerentials, country <b>elevator,</b> <b>corn</b> prices, market structure. WITH I N THE LIMITS of the perfect marketas defined by Shepherd, prices shoulddiffer among locations {{by no more than}} the cost of transportation; among time periods by no more than the cost of storage; and among product forms by no more than the cost of transformation [13, pp. 19 - 25]. Examination of pricing patterns, even in a market as highly developed as the grain market, reveals price dif-ferentials that cannot be readily explained by these three cost factors [4, p. 53; 5, p. 2]. Designating these differences as market imper-fections [6, p. 607] does little to identify the cause of the aberrations or to suggest possible solutions. There is little opportunity for im-proving performance unless the causal factors can be isolated and the malleable dimensions [15, pp. 401 - 402] 0 f structure and conduct can be identified. The objective of the research re-ported in this paper was to explain price differ-entials among country elevators in Illinois and to identify the extent of market imperfections associated with them.

50|$|Marysville {{has a very}} {{developed}} industrial economy. It {{houses a}} major Intertape Polymer factory and Mueller Brass factory. Marysville {{is also home to}} Marysville Hydrocarbons, site of a recently completed ethanol plant near the southern city border. Marysville has a growing industrial park, which includes an auto parts (previously Chrysler) factory, an addition to the MOPAR parts distribution center. In 1973, Consumers Energy built a synthetic gas plant near Marysville Michigan. It was {{the first of its kind}} ever built. In 1973 the Marysville gas reforming plant could produce up to 100 million cubic feet of gas per day. That doubled in 1974 when a second train was brought on line, providing up to 220 million cubic feet (6.2 million cubic meters) of gas per day from 50,000 barrels/day of liquid hydrocarbon feedstock. The plant used natural gas liquids imported from Ontario via a pipeline under the St. Clair River. The gas produced was of comparable quality to natural gas. At one point, Marysville gas powered over one quarter of all Consumers Power customers in Michigan. It also helped lessen the effects felt by Consumers Power customers during the 1973 oil crisis. The plant was shut down for economic reasons in 1979. It is now the location of Marysville Hydrocarbons, an ethanol refinery. Many local <b>corn</b> growers and <b>elevators</b> truck their grain to Marysville for ethanol processing. Marysville Hydrocarbons is the only one of its kind in the immediate area.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{comprised}} of two parts, both of which addressed issues of identity preserved (IP) grains at a large, terminal inland elevator in the Eastern <b>Corn</b> Belt. Presently, <b>elevator</b> managers are uncertain as to whether current IP premiums are sufficient to cover handling expenses. The objective of Part I is to identify how blending operations influences the operational efficiency-IP premium trade-off. ^ The objective of Part II was to identify how market-level feedback data influenced grain flows in a selected market area. The feedback loop allowed for changes neighboring grain handling facilities 2 ̆ 7 bid prices to influence grain flows to the case study elevator. ^ Part I model results suggest the addition of 5 (10) percent each of 2 IP corn varieties yields a net return on corn grains of 6, 030 (20, 708). When the case study elevator adjusts their soybean product mix to include 5 (10) percent each of 2 IP soybean varieties, the net return on soybean grains is 51, 951 (85, 540). Results suggest that while total net returns increase in both 10 and 20 percent IP grain volumes, the return from IP corn varieties does not appear large enough to entice managers of large inland terminal elevators to start handling IP grains. Managers of facilities such as these will want returns in excess of those demonstrated by corn varieties before changing their product mix strategies. ^ Results from Part II suggest that competitor bid price changes do influence grain flows at the case study elevator. The competitor 2 ̆ 7 s location and product mix are found to drive the results. Grain facilities with similar profiles to the case study elevator tend to draw away large volumes of commodity grains. Dedicated IP grain facilities in the selected market area draw the higher value IP grains away from the case study elevator as expected. The variability in grain flow distribution results {{suggest that there is}} increased risk associated with IP grains. Elevator managers looking to adjust their product mix to include IP grains, in search of higher net returns, will need to consider market-level competitive response behavior in their decision-making process. ...|$|R
