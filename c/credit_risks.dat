Since the entities would never return a profit, accounting guidelines required that Enron should take a write-off, where {{the value of the}} entity was removed from the balance sheet at a loss. To pressure Andersen into meeting Enron's earnings expectations, Enron would occasionally allow accounting companies Ernst & Young or PricewaterhouseCoopers to complete accounting tasks to create the illusion of hiring a new company to replace Andersen. Although Andersen was equipped with internal controls to protect against conflicted incentives of local partners, it failed to prevent conflict of interest. In one case, Andersen's Houston office, which performed the Enron audit, was able to overrule any critical reviews of Enron's accounting decisions by Andersen's Chicago partner. In addition, after news of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigations of Enron were made public, Andersen would later shred several tons of relevant documents and delete nearly 30,000 e-mails and computer files, causing accusations of a cover-up.|$|E

2500|$|Poles {{arriving}} in America frequently had {{years of experience}} working in agriculture and gained a reputation as skilled farmers in the United States. Polish immigrants traveled to the Northern United States intentionally with hopes of working in industrial trades. Stereotypes casting them as [...] "farm people" [...] and economic necessities in many cases predetermined their careers, which continued them in agricultural roles. Polish immigrants to Massachusetts and Connecticut came seeking jobs in New England's mills, but the local American population in Connecticut River Valley was actively seeking those jobs and effectively opened agricultural opportunities for them. In New England, Poles came and used land that had been abandoned by Yankee farmers. Poles had even higher crop yields than the local Americans because of their labor-intensive efforts and willingness to try lands previously disregarded as worthless. Poles succeeded rapidly; in Northampton in 1905, Poles were 4.9% {{of the population and}} owned 5.2% of the farmland. By 1930, they made up 7.1% of the town and owned 89.2% of the farmland. The Polish farmers' success is due to their large families, where children helped in agriculture, and their long hours of work, as many spent hours clearing abandoned land after a full day's work. Louis Adamic in A Nation of Nations wrote that Poles [...] "restored hundreds of thousands of apparently hopeless acres to productivity". Lenders viewed Polish immigrants as low <b>credit</b> <b>risks</b> because of their thrift, work ethic, and honesty. Polish immigrants were said to embody [...] "immigrant Puritanism", demonstrating economic puritanism better than the original New Englanders.

Hence, bank <b>credit</b> <b>risk</b> management has got important academic value and practical significance.

Both banks and national bank supervisors have realized the need to invest in <b>credit</b> <b>risk</b> management. Partly driven by regulations such as the Basel II Framework, large and medium-sized banks in the Euro zone have developed their own <b>credit</b> <b>risk</b> and capital models. While this has led to improvements in <b>credit</b> <b>risk</b> predictions, banks currently forgo value by not effectively integrating <b>credit</b> <b>risk</b> management into the lending process. This research is centered on the integration of <b>credit</b> <b>risk</b> management into the lending process. The problem statement is: "How can <b>credit</b> <b>risk</b> management be integrated into the lending process and will it result in improved performance?" Although {{much has been written about}} <b>credit</b> <b>risk</b> methodologies, the subject of integration is relatively unexplored. In this research, a growth model is proposed that helps banks to integrate <b>credit</b> <b>risk</b> management into their lending process through a series of phases. For each o these phases, a bank qualifies when both organizational and methodological requirements are fulfilled. The model starts with the measurement of individual <b>credit</b> <b>risk</b> exposures, but develops towards active management of the entire loan portfolio. Full integration results when the lending process is committed to the optimization of Economic Profit in which <b>credit</b> <b>risk</b> management is an invaluable component. The growth model is tested among CFOs of large and medium-sized banks of the Euro zone of which 25 percent participated. Most banks in the questionnaire did not fully integrate <b>credit</b> <b>risk</b> management into the lending process, but they saw the need to improve it. Therefore, a framework that helps banks to achieve the integration is useful. The results show that there is convincing evidence that respondents agree with the path and the benefits of the phases of the growth model.
