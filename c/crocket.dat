25|$|With {{regard to}} {{paneling}} generally, there were, {{during the last}} fifty years of the period now under review, three styles of design followed by most European carvers, each of which attained great notoriety. Firstly, a developed form of small Panelling. tracery which was very common in France and the Netherlands. A square-headed panel would be filled in with small detail of flamboyant character, the perpendicular line or mullion being always subordinate, as in the German chasse (Muse Cluny), and in some cases absent, as the screen work of Évreux cathedral shows us. Secondly, the linenfold design. The great majority of examples are of a very conventional form, but at Bere Regis, Dorsetshire, the designs with tassels, and at St Sauvur, Caen, those with fringe work, readily justify the universal title applied to this very decorative treatment of large surfaces. At the beginning of the 16th century yet another pattern became the fashion. The main lines of the design consisted of flat hollow mouldings sometimes in the form of interlacing circles (Gatton, Surrey), at other times chiefly straight (Rochester cathedral), and the intervening spaces would be filled in with cusps or sprigs of foliage. It marks the last struggle of this great school of design to withstand the oncoming flood of the new art, the great Renaissance. From this time onward Gothic work, in spite of various attempts, has never again taken a place in domestic decoration. The lines of the tracery style, the pinnacle, and the <b>crocket</b> unequaled as they have always been in devotional expression are universally considered unsuited for decoration in the ordinary house.|$|E

Pamphlets such as Common Sense (1775–76) and The American Crisis (1776 to 1783) were used to spread anti-British propaganda in the United States, as well as the slogan [...] "taxation without representation is tyranny." [...] After the revolution was won, disagreements broke out regarding the United States Constitution. Supporters of the constitution sent letters now called the Federalist Papers to major news outlets, which helped persuade the public to support the constitution. Exaggerated stories of Davy <b>Crocket</b> and the California Gold Rush were used to persuade the public to fight the war against Mexico and to migrate west in the U.S. respectively.|$|E

2500|$|Born {{into slavery}} in St. Louis, Missouri in 1830, Lucy Ann Berry was the {{daughter}} of slaves Polly Berry (born Polly <b>Crocket)</b> and a mulatto father whose name she did not note. They also had a second daughter, Nancy. Polly <b>Crocket</b> and Lucy's father were slaves owned by Major Taylor Berry and his wife, Frances. Lucy said that Polly Berry had been born free in Illinois, but was kidnapped when a child by slave catchers and sold into slavery in Missouri. (In her freedom suit, Polly Berry deposed that she was held as a slave in Wayne County, Kentucky by Joseph Crockett, and was brought by him to Illinois. There they stayed for several weeks while he hired her out for domestic work. As Illinois was a free state, he was supposed to lose his right to hold slave property by staying there, and Polly could have been freed. It was on this basis that she was later awarded freedom, as witnesses were found to testify as to her having been held illegally as a slave in Illinois.|$|E

There is, however, in this form no real intention of imitating a flower, any more than in the meeting of the tails of these two Etruscan griffins. The notable circumstance in this piece of Gothic is its advanced form of <b>crocket,</b> and its prominent foliation, with nothing in the least approaching to floral ornament.|$|E
60|$|And {{there are}} colorists who can keep their {{quiet in the}} midst of a {{jewellery}} of light; but, for the most part, it is better to avoid breaking up either lines or masses by too many points, and to make the few points used exceedingly precious. So the best crockets and finials are set, like stars, along the lines, and at the points, which they adorn, with considerable intervals between them, and exquisite delicacy and fancy of sculpture in their own designs; if very small, they may become more frequent, and describe lines by a chain of points; but their whole value is lost if they are gathered into bunches or clustered into tassels and knots; and an over-indulgence in them always marks lowness of school. In Venice, the addition of the finial to the arch-head is the first sign of degradation; all her best architecture is entirely without either crockets or finials; and her ecclesiastical architecture may be classed, with fearless accuracy, as better or worse, in proportion to the diminution or expansion of the <b>crocket.</b> The absolutely perfect use of the <b>crocket</b> is found, I think, in the tower of Giotto, and in some other buildings of the Pisan school. In the North they generally err on one side or other, and are either florid and huge, or mean in outline, looking as if they had been pinched out of the stonework, as throughout the entire cathedral of Amiens; and are besides connected with the generally spotty system which has been spoken of under the head of archivolt decoration.|$|E

6000|$|... 174. There is no {{question}} in my own mind, and, I believe, none in that of any other long-practised student of mediæval art, that in pure structural Gothic the church of St. Urbain at Troyes is without rival in Europe. Here is a rude sketch of its use of the <b>crocket</b> in the spandrils of its external tracery, and here are the waves of the Greek sea round the son of Poseidon. Seventeen hundred years are between them, but the same mind is in both. I wonder how many times seventeen hundred years Mr. Darwin will ask, to retrace the Greek designer of this into his primitive ape; or how many times six hundred years of such improvements as we have made on the church of St. Urbain, will be needed in order to enable our descendants to regard the designers of that, as only primitive apes.|$|E

[...] As {{she said}} so, Colonel Osborne boldly {{walked across the}} village and pulled the bell at the iron gate, while Bozzle, {{crouching}} among the tombs, saw the handle in his hand. [...] "There he is," [...] said Priscilla. Everybody in the Clock House had known that the fly, which they had seen, had brought [...] "the Colonel" [...] into Nuncombe Putney. Everybody had known that he had breakfasted at the Stag and Antlers. And everybody now {{knew that he was}} at the gate ringing the bell. [...] "Into the drawing-room," [...] said Mrs. Stanbury, with a fearful, tremulous whisper, to the girl who went across the little garden in front to open the iron gate. The girl felt as though Apollyon were there, and as though she were called upon to admit Apollyon. Mrs. Stanbury having uttered her whisper, hurried away up-stairs. Priscilla held her ground in the parlour, determined to be near the scene of action if there might be need. And it must be acknowledged that she peeped from behind the curtain, anxious {{to catch a glimpse of}} the terrible man, whose coming to Nuncombe Putney she regarded as so severe a misfortune.|$|E
60|$|Farther yet. We are to {{remember}} that {{not only do the}} associated features of the larger architecture tend to excite the strength of fancy, but the architectural laws to which you are obliged to submit your decoration stimulate its ingenuity. Every <b>crocket</b> which you are to crest with sculpture,--every foliation which you have to fill, presents itself to the spectator's fancy, not only as a pretty thing, but as a problematic thing. It contained, he perceives immediately, not only a beauty which you wished to display, but a necessity which you were forced to meet; and the problem, how to occupy such and such a space with organic form in any probable way, or how to turn such a boss or ridge into a conceivable image of life, becomes at once, to him as to you, a matter of amusement as much as of admiration. The ordinary conditions of perfection in form, gesture, or feature, are willingly dispensed with, when the ugly dwarf and ungainly goblin have only to gather themselves into angles, or crouch to carry corbels; and the want of skill which, in other kinds of work would have been required for the finishing of the parts, will at once be forgiven here, if you have only disposed ingeniously what you have executed roughly, and atoned for the rudeness of your hands by the quickness of your wits.|$|E

6000|$|There {{had been}} various letters passing, {{during the last}} six weeks, between Priscilla Stanbury and her brother, {{respecting}} the Clock House at Nuncombe Putney. The ladies at Nuncombe had, certainly, gone into the Clock House on the clear understanding that the expenses of the establishment were to be incurred on behalf of Mrs. Trevelyan. Priscilla had assented to the movement most doubtingly. She had disliked {{the idea of taking}} the charge of a young married woman who was separated from her husband, and she had felt that a going down after such an uprising,--a fall from the Clock House back to a cottage,--would be very disagreeable. She had, however, allowed her brother's arguments to prevail, and there they were. The annoyance which she had anticipated from the position of their late guest had fallen upon them: it had been felt grievously, from the moment in which Colonel Osborne called at the house; and now that going back to the cottage must be endured. Priscilla understood {{that there had been a}} settlement between Trevelyan and Stanbury as to the cost of the establishment so far;--but that must now be at an end. In their present circumstances she would not continue to live there, and had already made inquiries as to some humble roof for their shelter. For herself she would not have cared had it been necessary for her to hide herself in a hut,--for herself, as regarded any feeling as to her own standing in the village. For herself, she was ashamed of nothing. But her mother would suffer, and she knew what Aunt Stanbury would say to Dorothy. To Dorothy at the present moment, if Dorothy should think of accepting her suitor, the change might be very deleterious; but still it should be made. She could not endure to live there on the very hard-earned proceeds of her brother's pen,--proceeds which were not only hard-earned, but precarious. She gave warning to the two servants who had been hired, and consulted with Mrs. <b>Crocket</b> as to a cottage, and was careful to let it be known throughout Nuncombe Putney that the Clock House was to be abandoned. The Clock House had been taken furnished for six months, of which half were not yet over; but there were other expenses of living there much greater than the rent, and go she would. Her mother sighed and assented; and Mrs. <b>Crocket,</b> having strongly but fruitlessly advised that the Clock House should be inhabited at any rate for the six months, promised her assistance. [...] "It has been a bad business, Mrs. Crocket," [...] said Priscilla; [...] "and all we can do now is to get out of it as well as we can. Every mouthful I eat chokes me while I stay there." [...] "It ain't good, certainly, miss, not to know as you're all straight the first thing as you wakes in the morning," [...] said Mrs. Crocket,--who was always able to feel when she woke that everything was straight with her.|$|E
6000|$|In the meantime, Colonel Osborne {{had ordered}} his {{breakfast at the}} Stag and Antlers, and had asked {{questions}} as {{to the position of}} the Clock House. He was altogether ignorant of Mr. Bozzle, although Mr. Bozzle had been on his track now for two days and two nights. He had determined, as he came on to Nuncombe Putney, {{that he would not be}} shame-faced about his visit to Mrs. Trevelyan. It is possible that he was not so keen in the matter as he had been when he planned his journey in London; and, it may be, that he really tried to make himself believe that he had come all the way to the confines of Dartmoor to see the porch of Cockchaffington Church. The session in London was over, and it was necessary for such a man as Colonel Osborne that he should do something with himself before he went down to the Scotch grouse. He had long desired to see something of the most picturesque county in England; and now, as he sat eating his breakfast in Mrs. Crocket's parlour, he almost looked upon his dear Emily as a subsidiary attraction. [...] "Oh, that's the Clock House," [...] he said to Mrs. <b>Crocket.</b> [...] "No, I have not the pleasure of knowing Mrs. Stanbury; very respectable lady, so I have heard; widow of a clergyman; ah, yes; son up in London; I know him;--always writing books is he? Very clever, I dare say. But there's a lady,--indeed two ladies,--whom I do know. Mrs. Trevelyan is there, I think,--and Miss Rowley." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{this way}} it was settled among them that Colonel Osborne was to be received. On the next morning, Friday morning, Colonel Osborne, doubtless having heard {{something}} of Mrs. <b>Crocket</b> from his friend at Cockchaffington, was up early, and had himself driven over to Nuncombe Putney before breakfast. The ever-watchful Bozzle was, of course, at his heels,--or rather, not at his heels {{on the first two}} miles of the journey; for Bozzle, with painful zeal, had made himself aware of all the facts, and had started on the Nuncombe Putney road half an hour before the Colonel's fly was in motion. And when the fly passed him he was lying discreetly hidden behind an old oak. The driver, however, had caught a glimpse of him as he was topping a hill, and having seen him about on the previous day, and perceiving that he was dressed in a decent coat and trousers, and that, nevertheless, he was not a gentleman, began to suspect that he was--somebody. There was a great deal said afterwards about Bozzle in Mrs. Clegg's yard at Lessboro'; but the Lessboro' mind was never able to satisfy itself altogether respecting Bozzle and his mission. As to Colonel Osborne and his mission, the Lessboro' mind did satisfy itself with much certainty. The horse was hardly taken from out of Colonel Osborne's fly in Mrs. Crocket's yard when Bozzle stepped into the village by a path which he had already discovered, and soon busied himself among the tombs in the churchyard. Now, one corner of the churchyard was immediately opposite to the iron gate leading into the Clock House. [...] "Drat 'un," [...] said the wooden-legged postman, still sitting on his donkey, to Mrs. Crocket's ostler, [...] "if there be'ant the chap as was here yesterday when I was a starting, and I zeed 'un in Lezbro' street thick very morning." [...] "He be'ant arter no good, that 'un," [...] said the ostler. After that a close watch was kept upon the watcher.|$|E
