Since then, many companies have introduced either a second GUL policy that has a slightly higher premium, but in return the policy owner has <b>cash</b> <b>surrender</b> <b>values</b> that show a better internal rate of return on surrender than the additional premiums could earn in a risk-free investment outside of the policy.|$|R

50|$|Life {{settlement}} providers {{serve as}} the purchaser in a life settlement transaction and are responsible for paying the client a cash sum greater than the policy's <b>cash</b> <b>surrender</b> <b>value.</b> The top providers in the industry fund many transactions each year and hold the seller's policy as a confidential portfolio asset. They are experienced in the analysis and valuation of large-face-amount policies and work directly with advisors to develop transactions that are customized to a client's particular situation. They have in-house compliance departments to carefully review transactions and, most importantly, they are backed by institutional funds.|$|E

5000|$|A life {{settlement}} is {{the sale of}} an existing life insurance policy to a third party for more than its <b>cash</b> <b>surrender</b> <b>value,</b> but less than its net death benefit. [...] There {{are a number of}} reasons that a policy owner may choose to sell his or her life insurance policy. The policy owner may no longer need or want his or her policy, he or she may wish to purchase a different kind of life insurance policy, or premium payments may no longer be affordable. [...] Policy owners often learn about settling their policies from a financial planner or advisor, insurance broker, attorney, friends or family, or estate planning presentations.|$|E
5000|$|When an {{insurance}} company reports to its state insurance regulator {{that it is in}} financial trouble, the state will first attempt to assist the company back toward financial stability. If the state insurance department determines the company cannot be saved, then the insurance commissioner asks the state court to order the liquidation of the company. [...] Once the order to liquidate a company that operates in multiple states is handed down, NOLHGA, on behalf of affected member state guaranty associations, assembles a task force of affected guaranty associations to analyze the company’s commitments to policyholders. Each affected state guaranty association pays out claims to the insurance company's policyholders in the state; in some instances, the associations arrange for policies to be transferred to a financially sound insurer. [...] Each state guaranty association is governed by state law; most associations cover up to at least $300,000 for life insurance death benefits, $100,000 in <b>cash</b> <b>surrender</b> <b>value</b> for life insurance, $250,000 in withdrawal and cash values for annuities, and $100,000 in health insurance policy benefits.|$|E
40|$|The {{accounting}} for life insurance contracts purchased by third parties changed dramatically with {{the issuance of}} an FASB Staff Position (FSP) on FASB Technical Bulletin 85 - 4. The FSP provides initial and subsequent measurement guidance and financial statement presentation and disclosure guidance for investments by third-party investors in life settlement contracts. An investor must now elect to account for its investments in life settlement contracts using either the investment method or the fair value method. However, this election is irrevocable. Thus, investors must carefully choose between the two methods. Under the investment method, investments in life insurance are recorded initially {{at the cost of}} acquisition and subsequently increased for premiums paid to keep the policy in force; however, no income from the policy is recorded until death of the insured. Under the fair value method, investments in these policies are also adjusted for changes in fair value {{over the life of the}} policy. Under both methods, income is recognized at the death of the insured that is equal in the difference between death proceeds and the carrying amount of the policy. Under the former <b>cash</b> <b>surrender</b> <b>value</b> method, income at death of the insured was based on the death proceeds and a policy 2 ̆ 7 s <b>cash</b> <b>surrender</b> <b>value,</b> often zero. Since the methods differ in the manner for measuring income, investors need to understand the implications of choosing between the two methods.

5000|$|Potentially {{higher costs}} - VUL {{policies}} {{may be more}} expensive than other types of permanent insurance, such as Whole Life and traditional Universal Life. Volatility of <b>cash</b> <b>surrender</b> <b>values,</b> especially at late duration, can cause a [...] "reverse dollar cost averaging" [...] effect that results in higher costs of insurance charges. Proper funding of a contract may reduce this risk, but it cannot be completely eliminated.|$|R
50|$|All values {{related to}} the policy (death benefits, <b>cash</b> <b>surrender</b> <b>values,</b> premiums) are usually {{determined}} at policy issue, {{for the life of}} the contract, and usually cannot be altered after issue. This means that the insurance company assumes all risk of future performance versus the actuaries' estimates. If future claims are underestimated, the insurance company makes up the difference. On the other hand, if the actuaries' estimates on future death claims are high, the insurance company will retain the difference.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} effect of life {{settlement}} market {{on the structure of}} the long-term contracts o¤ered by the primary insurance market, {{as well as on the}} consumer welfare in a dynamic model of insurance with one-sided commitment as in Hendel and Lizzeri (2003) and Daily, Hendel and Lizzeri (2008). We show that the presence of the settlement market a¤ects the extent as well as the form of dynamic reclassification risk insurance in the equilibrium of the primary insurance market; and that the settlement market generally leads to lower consumer welfare. In the most extreme form, the presence of the settlement market can completely unravel the dynamic contracts to a sequence of spot short-term contracts. We also examine the primary insurers’ response to the settlement market when they can offer enriched contracts by specifying optimally chosen <b>cash</b> <b>surrender</b> <b>values</b> (CSVs). We show that the option of specifying CSVs is a useless option when there is no settlement firms; but facing the threat from the settlement firms, contracts with optimally chosen health-contingent CSVs will emerge in the equilibrium of the primary market, and such contracts improve consumer welfare, even though consumer welfare is still lower than that without the secondary market. In contrast, the option to endogenously specify non-health contingent CSVs is useless for the primary insurers...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} {{we deal with the}} problem of pricing a {{guaranteed}} life insurance participating policy, sold in the Italian market, which embeds a surrender option. This feature is an American-style put option that enables the policyholder to sell back the contract to the insurer at the <b>cash</b> <b>surrender</b> <b>value.</b> Employing a recursive binomial formula patterned after the Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein (1979) discrete option pricing model we compute, first of all, the total price of the contract, which also includes a compensation for the participation feature ("participation option," henceforth). Then this price is split into the value of three components: the "basic contract", the "participation option", and the "surrender option". The numerical implementation of the model allows us to catch some comparative statics properties and to tackle the problem of suitably fixing the contractual parameters in order to obtain the premium computed by insurance companies according to standard actuarial practice.

A policy owner with unneeded life insurance can surrender the policy to the insurer for its <b>cash</b> <b>surrender</b> <b>value.</b> Or, the owner may receive more by selling the policy to a third-party investor through a life settlement. These transactions have involved high-dollar-amount policies covering older persons. Despite their potential benefits, life settlements can have unintended consequences for policy owners, such as unexpected tax liabilities. Also, policy owners commonly rely on intermediaries to help them, and some intermediaries may engage in abusive practices. As requested, this report addresses how the life settlement market is organized and regulated, and what challenges policy owners, investors, and others face in connection with life settlements. GAO reviewed and analyzed studies on life settlements and applicable state and federal laws; surveyed insurance regulators and life settlement providers; and interviewed relevant market participants, state and federal regulators, trade associations, and market observers. ...|$|E
40|$|Un examen des différents plans d'assurance lancés ces dernières années par les {{institutions}} Canadiennes-françaises {{permet de}} constater qu'il existe pour répondre à un besoin une tendance à penser les problèmes d'assurance en fonction de la famille. Les besoins essentiels de la famille, en effet, sont la subsistance et la sécurité en cas de décès prématuré du père. Le plan d'assurance familiale de l'Assurance-Vie Desjardins a été proposé pour tenter de trouver une solution à cette situation et entre dans la voie d'évolution qui doit se poursuivre. Cet article a pour but d'exposer les principes, avantages et fonctionnement d'un tel plan récent d'assurance familiale. Two new Insurance Plans are now offered by l'AssuranceVie Desjardins. The "Plan d'Assurance Familiale" {{is a family}} insurance contract which constitutes a self-sufficient insurance plan in a single policy. The reason for such an initiative is that the average French Canadian worker who usually has a large family cannot be adequately insured for a premium he can afford if he insures all his children through individual contracts. Here is {{the description of the}} plan. On the life of the family father:A) An amount of $ 1, 500. 00 up to age 65, reduced to $ 750. 00 after 65. B) A series of family income monthly benefits; the first such benefit being at start an immediate monthly income of $ 25. 00 for 28 years, followed two years later by an additional income of $ 20. 00 for 24 years, followed from 2 years to 2 years by additional incomes of $ 15. 00, $ 10. 00 and $ 5. 00 for durations 20, 16 and 12 years. C) All children, present or future, whatever their number, are insured for amounts increasing up to $ 500. 00. This is a term to age 21 insurance. D) The family mother is insured for $ 500. 00. This insurance is permanent. The premium of such a policy reaches 4 % of the income of a $ 50. 00 per week worker at age 34. Since the plan has been designed for newweds or young married couples, the premium will not exceed 3 % in most cases. After 25 years, it is sharply reduced because benefits B and C are paidup. Benefits A and D are paidup at 65. In case of death of the father, premiums on the insurance of the mother and children will be waived. In case of total disability of the father before age 60, all premiums will be waived during the disability period. A "Prévoyance Familiale" Plan is also offered. It is designed for the young bachelor. The basis is Part A of the Family Insurance Plan to which a special feature has been added: In case of marriage, a conversion credit is granted. Such credit is substantially higher than the corresponding <b>cash</b> <b>surrender</b> <b>value,</b> and is applied towards the payment of the premiums of the new family Insurance policy, {{at a time when the}} insured might be in dire need of funds.

40|$|During 1933 {{there were}} two {{financial}} holidays, one in banking and one in life insurance. The first is well known. The Banking Holiday shut down every bank in the United States for ten days and ushered in sweeping changes in banking regulation. The second holiday is practically unknown, even to historians of insurance, who either ignore it [1; 3] or gloss over it [2, pp. 992 - 98; 11, p. 290; 16, p. 556; 17, p. 49]. The "insurance holiday " suspended the payment of <b>cash</b> <b>surrender</b> <b>values</b> and the granting of policy loans {{for a period of}} nearly six months. However, this holiday had no regulatory repercussions, although it affected millions of Americans, and it stemmed from the same cause as the banking holiday [...] the Depression. This paper contrasts the two holidays. It starts with a discussion of the similarities between banking and insurance. The paper then describes the cause and consequences of the two holidays. A concluding section draws some inferences about the regulatory process. THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN BANKING AND INSURANCE Banks and insurance companies perform very similar economic functions. Both are financial intermediaries. Each receives money [...] deposits or premiums [...] from people or businesses who wish to save and lends it to people and businesses that wish to borrow. This is risk management pure and simple. The difference between banking and insurance lies solely in the customer's claim on the institution. The depositor has an unconditional right to withdraw his funds at maturity. In the ease of a checking account he can do so on demand. In contrast, the insurance policyholder has no such right. His claim is conditional. He has no claim unless and until the event insured against actually occurs [...] a fire, an accident, or death. In the ease of life insurance, the similarities with banking are closer. Except for term insurance, life insurance products contain savings and credit features. For example, a whole-life policy includes not only insurance, but also provides a tax-deferred savings account and allows the 105 106 policyholder to borrow against the cash value of the policy. Thus, "a life insurance company performs some of the functions of a savings bank and, to a smaller degree, of a commercial bank, " [12, pp. 64 - 65]...|$|R
50|$|Permanent life {{insurance}} is {{life insurance}} {{that covers the}} remaining lifetime of the insured. A permanent insurance policy accumulates a cash value up to its date of maturation.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a methodology {{that can be}} used by insurers to construct predictive models for their own insurance cash flows. The insurance cash flow components evaluated include premium flows, policy loans, and <b>cash</b> <b>value</b> <b>surrenders.</b> Also, the paper evaluates several hypotheses in the insurance literature that attempt to explain insurance cash flows. Though the results are theoretically consistent, they produce some interesting contrasts to findings of similar studies for whole life policies. For example, these results confirm that: (i) the credited rate strategy is important to policy performance; (ii) the emergency fund hypothesis appears to apply to policy loan utilization, premium payments, and total insurance cash flows; (iii) the arbitrage potential with regard to policy loans is reduced; and (iv) direct recognition of policy loans seems to be effective in reducing the disintermediation risk of traditional whole life insurance policies with fixed policy loan rates. Although policyholders do increase their use of policy loans as inflation increases, the overall results suggest that they tend to increase contributions to their universal life policies in order to maintain levels of protection in real terms. Finally, interest rate risk does exist for companies issuing universal life because changes in market interest rates lead to decreases in premiums and in total insurance cash flows. This lends support to the alternative funds hypothesis...|$|R

50|$|When {{it became}} {{apparent}} that many policies would not cover the cost of the mortgage loan, policy holders sought alternative methods to repay their mortgage and dispose of their endowment policies. Whilst initially, the only method was to surrender (cancel) the policy with the life assurance company themselves, obtaining the <b>surrender</b> <b>value</b> calculated by them, a second hand market slowly developed, providing policyholders with much added <b>value</b> over their <b>surrender</b> <b>values.</b>|$|R
40|$|A tontine {{provides}} a mortality driven, age-increasing payout structure through the pooling of mortality. Because a tontine does not entail any guarantees, the payout {{structure of a}} tontine {{is determined by the}} pooling of individual characteristics of tontinists. Therefore, the surrender decision of single tontinists directly affects the remaining members' payouts. Nevertheless, the opportunity to surrender is crucial to the success of a tontine from a regulatory as well as a policyholder perspective. Therefore, this paper derives the fair <b>surrender</b> <b>value</b> of a tontine, first on the basis of expected values, and then incorporates the increasing payout volatility to determine an equitable <b>surrender</b> <b>value.</b> Results show that the surrender decision requires a discount on the fair <b>surrender</b> <b>value</b> as security for the remaining members. The discount intensifies in decreasing tontine size and increasing risk aversion. However, tontinists are less willing to surrender for decreasing tontine size and increasing risk aversion, creating a natural protection against tontine runs stemming from short-term liquidity shocks. Furthermore we argue that a surrender decision based on private information requires a discount on the fair <b>surrender</b> <b>value</b> as well...|$|R

He had adapted the idea from somewhat similar principles {{that had been made}} law in the state of Massachusetts, United States of America, in 1861. Templeton, however, in 1869 introduced a clause in the policies of the newly formed National Mutual Life Association which provided that overdue premiums would automatically be advanced against the <b>surrender</b> <b>value</b> until the <b>surrender</b> <b>value</b> was exhausted. The principle was adopted by other companies, and has proved of the greatest benefit to an immense number of people.|$|R
