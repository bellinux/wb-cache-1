40|$|When I {{embarked}} on my postgraduate studies, with an enthusiasm for finding {{out more about}} the history of white and Aboriginal women's relationships, the issue of white women and complicity became very personally pointed. I was enthusiastically attending all sorts of Aboriginal protest rallies and meetings, getting active in an Aboriginal neighbourhood centre, and talking politics with Kooris at the pub. Meanwhile, in my studies I was digesting a tremendous amount of literature about the position and role of white women in colonization – all with a growing sense of confusion. My own position as a privileged white woman seemed to invalidate any attempt by me to write this history. Writing from such a perspective, it seemed, constituted little more than an exercise in redemptive apologia at best and, at worst, it was a reiteration of colonial domination. As my sense of disconnection intensified, I went back to the town where I had lived as a child in the East Kimberley, accompanied by my childhood friend, an Aboriginal woman, who had also moved away as an adult. But my return visit in her company did not achieve my hoped-for sense of purpose. I became only more uneasy – 'unsettled' if you like – as I realised this was her place and her history, so much more than mine. I decided then to defer my studies, and headed up the Far North Coast of New South Wales to live with my aunt and grandmother. While I was there, reluctantly promising to 'do' some family history for my Gran, I uncovered the remarkable story of my great-grandmother Joan Kingsley-Strack, and it <b>changed</b> <b>my</b> <b>outlook</b> on Australian history, on women's history, and on history in general...|$|R

And my belief in God. —Tripathi talking about his inspiration for The Immortals of Meluha Author Amish Tripathi is a finance professional educated from Indian Institute of Management Calcutta (IIM-C). While working in the insurance industry, Tripathi felt that his life was devoid of any meaning or self. Ultimately {{he decided to take}} the spiritual route. He started reading on the different philosophies and the Indian mythologies. One day, while watching a historical program, Tripathi and his family got into the discussion about consciousness and the evil inside man. In the program they learned that in ancient Persia, demons were known as Daeva (a term reserved for the Gods in Indian mythology), and angels were called Asuras (a term reserved for demons in Indian mythology). Tripathi added, [...] "It set me thinking that this was exact opposite of our Vedic etymology where evil was Asura and gods were Devas. It struck me that if the two civilizations were to confront each other, they would be at stark odds and calling each other evil." [...] But when he decided {{to write a book about}} the philosophy of evil, his family discouraged him, saying that the subject itself was not popular and would get a narrow audience. They suggested that Tripathi write a thriller/adventure novel and the philosophy should be a part of the story, hence there would be a mainstream appeal in it. Tripathi felt that no subject was better than Shiva, one of the major Hindu deity and the destroyer of evil; his journey and stories about him would deliver the philosophy that he wanted to convey, to his readers. Once he started to write a book about Shiva, he decided to base it on some fundamental beliefs of his. He noted that the Hindu Gods were probably not [...] "mythical beings or a figment of a rich imagination", but rather they were once human beings like the rest. It was their deeds in the human life that made them famous as Gods.|$|R

In that same year she acted opposite Saagar co-star Kamal Haasan in her first regional film, Vikram, a Tamil-language sci-fi feature. She played the minor part of Inimaasi, a young princess who falls for the title character, played by Haasan. At that time, she also worked in numerous Hindi films made by producers from the South, including Pataal Bhairavi, which she detested.

40|$|Place and Praxis’ explores {{concepts}} of ‘place’ that will inform landscape architecture {{theory and practice}} in an Australian context. It examines both Western and Indigenous perspectives of ‘place’, searching for possible points of contact between the different world-views. Thus, a (Western) concept of place as a-priori to ‘space’ supports an Australian Aboriginal epistemology and ontology, (while an alternative concept of ‘place’ as made by humans out of ‘space’ continues the colonial project). A recognition of Australian Aboriginal cultures in everyday ‘place’ leads to critiques of contemporary practice that find opportunities for reconciliatory actions and the decolonising of landscape architecture practice. In Australia, the discipline of landscape architecture has historically looked to imported models of theory and practice for its knowledge base. In this way it inadvertently supports a continuing Western hegemony of colonialism, {{at the expense of}} the recognition of diverse Indigenous ontologies and epistemologies. The resulting denial of authentic ‘place’ reverberates in practice, denying landscape architecture an authentic basis. The research findings are presented in the context of a continuing journey of coming to know another world view, informed by a growing body of Indigenist researchers and critical reflection on practice. I find that ‘place’, approached in the context of a ‘more-than-human world’ by a phenomenological method, leads us to abandon old {{concepts of}} ‘place’ - as separate, objective, static and controlled by humans - in favour of an ‘essence of place’ that is storied, ‘lively’ and fosters ‘connection’.
