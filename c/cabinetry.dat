25|$|Woodworking is the {{activity}} or skill of making items from wood, and includes cabinet making (<b>Cabinetry</b> and Furniture), wood carving, joinery, carpentry, and woodturning.|$|E
25|$|The city prospered as {{it became}} a more {{important}} port, and eventually sea captains who had made their fortunes began {{to settle down and}} build larger houses for themselves. One of these homes, Hunter House, another NHL located along the water in Easton's Point, is preserved today for its quality <b>cabinetry,</b> much of it originally manufactured in Newport.|$|E
25|$|In 1857, when Petrof was 18 years old, he {{was visited}} by his {{maternal}} uncle Jan Heitzmann at his family's Hradec Králové home. Heitzmann {{and his partner}} Hölzl were already known piano manufacturers in Vienna. Petrof learned the trade in Vienna and in 1864 returned to Bohemia, where he built his first piano. In 1865 he transformed his father's <b>cabinetry</b> enterprise in the old town square, behind the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit, into a piano-making workshop.|$|E
25|$|On October 3, 2008, Saint Thomas Church {{announced}} the Vestry's decision {{to replace the}} aging Arents Memorial Chancel Organ with a new instrument. As part of a substantial renovation effort to the church, a new instrument from Dobson Pipe Organ Builders of Lake City, Iowa, will be installed to replace the current instrument. Plans call for the retention of the especially ornate 1913 organ case-front and console <b>cabinetry,</b> {{and the elimination of}} visible pipework added above the choir stall canopies in the 1956 rebuild, to better respect the church's well-developed neo-Gothic design aesthetic.|$|E
25|$|Within the Monck Wing, built between 1865 and 1866, {{are other}} living {{quarters}} and drawing and dining rooms generally for non-state affairs, {{such as the}} Pauline Vanier Room, a small sitting room where informal meetings are held with visiting heads of state and other officials. The room was originally created in the 1960s by Pauline Vanier out of an old aide-de-camp smoking room, giving the space pine panelling and filling it with antique furnishings from Quebec. However, it was later again refurbished to remove the tongue and groove planks Vanier had installed and which {{were said to be}} reminiscent of suburban basement panelling popular in the 1970s. The Pauline Vanier Room today contains furniture and other <b>cabinetry</b> works by Canadian artisans.|$|E
25|$|Difficulties in {{acquiring}} valley oak wood {{as well as}} issues stemming from its drying such as cracking and warping have shifted its consumption from a general purpose lumber to a primarily niche product. Valley oak wood has a small, but significant market for use in <b>cabinetry</b> though, and is also suitable for hardwood flooring. Tyloses present in the pores of valley oak wood increases its impermeability to fluids allowing it {{to be used in}} the production of water-tight vessels. Such vessels include wine barrels where valley oak wood sees limited role in the composition of and where it has similar properties to other white oaks such as a reduced tannin load compared to the red oaks and an open grain that allows for an increased transfer of oxygen.|$|E
25|$|Rideau Hall {{has long}} been a {{collection}} point for Canadian art and <b>cabinetry.</b> As early as the first viceregal inhabitants, the hall has held pieces by prominent Canadian cabinet makers, such as Jaques & Hay of Toronto, James Thompson of Montreal, and William Drum of Quebec. Originally, the interior decoration was heavily Victorian, with many Rococo influences. Renovations, however, have turned the interiors into predominantly Georgian spaces, with Adam and Palladian elements. Until the 1960s, the contents and colours of the house changed with each successive royal and viceroyal family; the consort typically seeing it as her duty to update Rideau Hall to suit both her personal and contemporary tastes. As there were few paintings in the palace's permanent collection, the National Gallery would provide works on loan; a relationship that continues into the present.|$|E
25|$|After {{leaving office}} McKenna moved to Cap-Pélé, New Brunswick, near Moncton, and {{returned}} to the practice of law and sat on numerous corporate boards. He also purchased with his son, James McKenna, Glenwood Kitchen Ltd. A manufacturer of high-end custom <b>cabinetry</b> in Shediac, New Brunswick. His membership on the Canadian advisory board of the Carlyle Group drew adverse media attention; the media ceased pursuing the issue when McKenna explained that the board was established to advise on a Canadian investment fund that the group never created and that the board had never become active. Following the announcement of his appointment as Canadian ambassador to Washington, he resigned his position as counsel at law firms including McInnes Cooper and Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt, as well as all positions on corporate boards including his role as interim {{chairman of the board of}} CanWest Global Communications, a post he assumed upon the death of its founder and chairman Israel Asper.|$|E
25|$|Theodore Roosevelt, Sr. (father of {{the future}} president) hired Furness to {{decorate}} his newly built townhouse at 6 West 57th Street, New York City (demolished). The ornate paneling, bookcases, <b>cabinetry</b> and mantels are based on designs in Furness's sketchbook, and their manufacture is attributed to Pabst. The pair is also credited with individual pieces of Roosevelt furniture. The massive dining table – with a base featuring carved herons pinching frogs in their bills – {{is now in the}} collection of the High Museum of Art, Atlanta, Georgia. The cameo-carved master bedroom suite is now at Sagamore Hill National Historic Site, President Theodore Roosevelt's summer home in Oyster Bay, New York. The late antiques expert/dealer Robert Edwards – who discovered the Pabst-attributed cabinets now at the Brooklyn Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art – identified a Modern Gothic chair, now in the Barrie & Deedee Wigmore collection, as having come from the Roosevelt library.|$|E
25|$|From {{the ground}} level {{entrance}} {{door on the}} western side of the tower, a spiral concrete staircase with steel tubular handrail winds around a central service duct before arriving in the near-centre of the observation room. Apart from an enclosed toilet in the north-west corner, the observation room is an open space with a central pillar that contains cavities for services that link to the roof level. Fixed angled glazing wraps around the north, east and south sides. A set of recent laminated <b>cabinetry</b> sits below the observation windows along the north-east. Original metal window frames on the western wall are a mixture of mid-point pivoting and fixed panes, while more recent aluminium-framed windows are found in the toilet. Floors are lined with linoleum and a system of suspended ceiling panels conceals the underside of the concrete roof slab. A recent sink and cupboard sits up against the southern wall of the toilet. All original communications equipment has been removed. Access to the external balcony, which wraps around all sides except the straight, western edge, is through a single door in the south-west corner. This timber door retains the original separate screen door. The narrow balcony has a concrete floor and a balustrade made from two tubular steel rails and widely separated balusters covered in asbestos cement sheeting rendered with pebble-dash on the exterior face. The steel balusters pierce the concrete floor slab and are fixed on the underside.|$|E

[...] A week later, Deng told The South China Morning Post, [...] "My wife is not well. She is sad and distressed. Sometimes she becomes emotional and confused." [...] Feng reportedly had a severe headache for several weeks after the abortion and attempted suicide multiple times. On June 15, an uncle told reporters Feng was in poor health and unable to eat. [...] On June 26, Feng was still in the hospital and suffering from headaches. [...] She told reporters that she wanted to go home, but that hospital staff would not allow her to leave. [...] On June 29, her family reported that Feng would be released the next day. [...] However, her condition worsened, and she did not return home until July 10.|$|E
500|$|The Art Deco-style interior, {{meant to}} evoke a 1920s Hollywood style, {{featured}} mahogany woodwork, tile floors and chandeliers. The inside also contained Spanish-style white stucco, spiral staircases and wrought iron features including stair rails, built-in <b>cabinetry</b> door and window hardware and lighting fixtures. The house included a basement pool (which eventually closed due to water leaks), a stone fireplace [...] in width, and small square windows. Also {{in the basement}} were the furnace, a storage room, and spaces for laundry and billiards. The main floor housed the garage, a kitchen and breakfast bay, the living and dining rooms and a music room. The master bedroom was adjacent to a deck above the dining and music rooms at {{the southwest corner of}} the property. Fireplaces and hallway floors featured brown ceramic tile; black glazed ceramic tile was used in the master bathroom, while black, red and yellow tiles were used in the breakfast bay. One of the castle's bathrooms was said to be modeled on Charlie Chaplin's. The interior was arranged around a central stair tower capped with a conical roof clad in copper. Chimneys vented the centrally located furnace and rose from fireplaces in the house's west hall.|$|E

2500|$|A router [...] ( [...] , also [...] ) {{is a tool}} used to rout out (hollow out) an area in {{the face}} of a {{relatively}} hard workpiece, typically of wood or plastic. The main application of routers is in woodworking, especially <b>cabinetry.</b> The router is most commonly used as a plunging tool and also inverted in a router table.|$|E
2500|$|Boise Cascade {{acquired}} Raygold {{and moved}} the company head office from Long Island to Winchester, Virginia. In the late 1970s, Boise Cascade changed it business focus from wood products to paper products. In 1979 four executives of the <b>cabinetry</b> division (Bill Brandt, Al Graber, Jeff Holcomb, and Don Mathias) initiated a leveraged buyout. They formed American Woodmark Corporation in 1980.|$|E

2500|$|Wright's {{residential}} {{designs of}} this era {{were known as}} [...] "prairie houses" [...] because the designs complemented the land around Chicago. [...] Prairie style houses often have {{a combination of these}} features: One or two-stories with one-story projections, an open floor plan, low-pitched roofs with broad overhanging eaves, strong horizontal lines, ribbons of windows (often casements), a prominent central chimney, built-in stylized <b>cabinetry,</b> and a wide use of natural materials—especially stone and wood.|$|E
2500|$|An {{extensive}} use {{was made in}} the interior of decoratively carved <b>cabinetry,</b> oak moldings, decorative plasterwork, and one of the Deep South's first uses of ornamental stained glass. [...] The stained glass {{is believed to have been}} produced by an early American ornamental stained glass company, that of Henry Sharp and Company of New York City. [...] It was featured in the arched transom and sidelights of the main doors, as well as the large arched window over the main staircase landing. [...] The glass was destroyed by vandals in the 1950s, as was many of the plasterwork ceiling medallions. [...] The entire house has original [...] heart pine floors.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{and after}} the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, kitchens were frequently not equipped with built-in <b>cabinetry,</b> and the lack of storage space in the kitchen became a real problem. The Hoosier Manufacturing Co. of Indiana adapted an existing furniture piece, the baker's cabinet, which had a similar structure of a table top with some cabinets above it (and frequently flour bins beneath) to solve the storage problem. By rearranging the parts and taking advantage of (then) modern metal working, they were able to produce a well-organized, compact cabinet which answered the home cook's needs for storage and working space. [...] A distinctive feature of the Hoosier cabinet is its accessories. As originally supplied, they were equipped with various racks and other hardware to hold and organize spices and various staples. One useful feature was the combination flour-bin/sifter, a tin hopper that could be used without having to remove it from the cabinet. A similar sugar bin was also common.|$|E
2500|$|The {{art nouveau}} [...] "Diamond Jim Brady Room" [...] was fitted out with {{matching}} <b>cabinetry</b> appointments and Tiffany glass, with arched mirrors of beveled glass and cut flowers across {{an expanse of}} marble and dark carved mahogany: [...] "At one end stands the knightly figure of Lohengrin, and at the other, on the wall, broods a shaggy buffalo head obtained at the St. Louis World's Fair. An oil painting of Bacchus appropriately surveys this scene from the opposite wall." [...] The room was named after [...] Diamond Jim Brady, a voracious eater who was referred to by one New York restaurateur as [...] "the best twenty-five customers I ever had". Brady was not a gangster, as some assumed, but a successful executive and founder of an automobile and railroad rolling stock manufacturer, the Standard Steel Car Company – later merged with Pullman – who had a passion for fancy jewelry. He said, [...] "Each must {{have a good time}} in his own way." [...] Brady's long-time eating companion was the noted actress Lillian Russell, for whom another room at Lüchow's was named.|$|E
2500|$|On July 29, 2005, Brent W. Jeffs {{filed suit}} accusing {{three of his}} uncles, {{including}} Warren Jeffs, of sexually assaulting {{him when he was}} a child. The suit also named the FLDS Church as a defendant. On August 10, former FLDS Church member Shem Fischer, Dan Fischer's brother, added the church and Warren Jeffs as defendants to a 2002 lawsuit claiming he was illegally fired because he no longer adhered to the faith. Fischer, who was a salesman for a wooden <b>cabinetry</b> business in Hildale, claimed church officials interfered with his relationship with his employer and blacklisted him. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the company and found that Fischer was not fired from his job, but quit instead. The district court ruling was overturned in part on the basis that Fischer was discriminated against on the basis of religion when he reapplied for his position and was denied employment because he had left the FLDS church. The parties eventually settled the case for an agreed amount of damages to Shem Fischer.|$|E
2500|$|The Bell Homestead Museum {{first opened}} to the public in October 1910 with two rooms {{available}} for viewing, and over several decades repurchased or received donations of much of the Bell family's original home furnishings, including its <b>cabinetry,</b> furniture and piano-like melodeon, eventually comprising 90% of their Melville House furnishings. Further donations from Bell family descendants also included books, china, paintings, [...] a silver tea service that was a wedding gift to Alexander Graham and his bride Mabel Bell, a gold candy dish that was a wedding present to the elder Bells, Melville's walnut shaving stand and Mabel's favourite wing chair. One important donated item is the original melodeon (serial number 16265 of the George A. Prince Company) given to the Homestead museum by the granddaughter of Jenny Cowherd (who later became Mrs. Joseph Durnan). Jenny's father was Thomas Cowherd, whose hardware store supplied stovepipe wire to Graham Bell, and her brother was James, who built almost 2,400 telephones for Melville's telephone company and for the Bell Telephone Company of Canada. [...] Jenny also played the melodeon and sang for at least one of Alexander Graham's telephone demonstrations.|$|E
2500|$|Floors 37 and 40 to 57 {{is about}} [...] of {{condominium}} space. Floors 38, 39 and 58 are mechanical floors. The 122 luxury condominiums, called The Residences at Two Liberty, {{are the highest}} in the city with condominiums located between [...] above ground level. Every condominium unit features a cappuccino machine, Italian-made Snaidero kitchen <b>cabinetry,</b> Miele appliances, and concierge service. The 37th floor contains a full spa and sauna, pool, and a gourmet restaurant called R2L which opened on January 21, 2010. The restaurant occupies [...] and can seat almost 300. The condominiums range in price from US$800,000 for a 40th-floor single bedroom to more than US$15 millions for a [...] penthouse. Because of low sales of the condos, the top portion of the building was to be converted into a boutique hotel in 2013. Due to low interest in the hotel, the top 10 floors of The Residences (floors 48–57) were to be converted into 60 condo units in 2015. Two Liberty Place's lobby was originally specifically designed for Cigna which used to lease the entire building. After Cigna reduced its presence in the tower, three separate lobbies were created, each with its own elevator bank, one for Cigna, one for the other corporate tenants, and the third for the residents.|$|E
2500|$|By {{supplying}} a wide assortment in {{a single}} category for lower prices a category killer retailer can [...] "kill" [...] that category for other retailers. A category killer is a specialist store that dominates a given category. Toys [...] "R" [...] Us, established in 1957, {{is thought to be}} the first category killer, dominating the children's toys and games market. For a few categories, such as electronics, home hardware, office supplies and children's toys, the products are displayed at the centre of the store and a sales person will be available to address customer queries and give suggestions when required. Rival retail stores are forced to reduce their prices if a category killer enters the market in a given geographic area. Examples of category killers include Toys [...] "R" [...] Us and Australia's Bunnings (hardware, DIY and outdoor supplies) and Officeworks (stationery and supplies for the home office and small office). Some category killers redefine the category. For example, Australia's Bunnings began as a hardware outlet, but now supplies a broad range of goods for the home handyman or small tradesman, including kitchen <b>cabinetry,</b> craft supplies, gardening needs and outdoor furniture. Similarly Officeworks straddles the boundary between stationery supplies, office furniture and digital communications devices in its quest to provide for all the needs of the retail consumer and the small, home office.|$|E
