5|$|<b>Cameroon</b> {{is viewed}} as rife with {{corruption}} {{at all levels of}} government. In 1997, <b>Cameroon</b> established anti-corruption bureaus in 29 ministries, but only 25% became operational, and in 2012, Transparency International placed <b>Cameroon</b> at number 144 on a list of 176 countries ranked from least to most corrupt. On 18 January 2006, Biya initiated an anti-corruption drive {{under the direction of the}} National Anti-Corruption Observatory. There are several high corruption risk areas in <b>Cameroon,</b> for instance, customs, public health sector and public procurement.|$|E

50|$|In 1922 it was {{mandated}} to Great Britain and France by the League of Nations. The French mandate {{was known as}} Cameroun, in French West Africa. The British mandate was administered as two territories, Northern <b>Cameroons</b> and Southern <b>Cameroons</b> in British West Africa. British Northern <b>Cameroons</b> consisted of two non-contiguous sections, divided by where the Nigerian and Cameroun borders met.|$|R
50|$|The name Ambazonia or Ambazania {{refers to}} two {{separate}} entities. One pertains to {{an advocacy group}} struggling for the total restoration of the statehood of the former British League of Nations Mandate of Southern <b>Cameroons.</b> It {{is also used to}} refer to the Southern <b>Cameroons</b> by organisations that struggle for the dissolution of the 1961 union of the Southern <b>Cameroons</b> with Cameroun.|$|R
5|$|After World War I, the {{territory}} was divided between France and the United Kingdom as League of Nations mandates. The Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC) political party advocated independence, but was outlawed by France in the 1950s, {{leading to the}} Cameroonian Independence War fought between French and UPC militant forces until early 1971. In 1960, the French-administered part of <b>Cameroon</b> became independent as the Republic of Cameroun under President Ahmadou Ahidjo. The southern part of British Cameroons federated with it in 1961 to form the Federal Republic of <b>Cameroon.</b> The federation was abandoned in 1972. The country was renamed the United Republic of <b>Cameroon</b> in 1972 and the Republic of <b>Cameroon</b> in 1984.|$|E
5|$|An {{irregular}} {{chain of}} mountains, hills, and plateaus {{known as the}} <b>Cameroon</b> range extends from Mount <b>Cameroon</b> on the coast—Cameroon's highest point at —almost to Lake Chad at Cameroon's northern border at 13°05'N. This region has a mild climate, particularly on the Western High Plateau, although rainfall is high. Its soils are among Cameroon's most fertile, especially around volcanic Mount <b>Cameroon.</b> Volcanism here has created crater lakes. On 21 August 1986, one of these, Lake Nyos, belched carbon dioxide and killed between 1,700 and 2,000 people. This area has been delineated by the World Wildlife Fund as the Cameroonian Highlands forests ecoregion.|$|E
5|$|At , <b>Cameroon</b> is the world's 53rd-largest country. It is {{slightly}} larger than the nation of Sweden and comparable in size to Papua New Guinea. The country is located in Central and West Africa on the Bight of Bonny, part of the Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean. <b>Cameroon</b> lies between latitudes 1° and 13°N, and longitudes 8° and 17°E.|$|E
5000|$|Representatives of Anglophone groups convened {{the first}} All Anglophone Conference (AAC1) in Buea from 2 April to 3 April 1993. The conference issued the [...] "Buea Declaration", {{which called for}} {{constitutional}} amendments to restore the 1961 federation. This {{was followed by the}} second All Anglophone Conference (AAC2) in Bamenda in 1994. This conference issued the [...] "Bamenda Declaration", which stated that if the federal state was not restored within a reasonable time, Southern <b>Cameroons</b> would declare its independence. The AAC was renamed the Southern <b>Cameroons</b> Peoples Conference (SCPC), and later the Southern <b>Cameroons</b> Peoples Organisation (SCAPO), with the Southern <b>Cameroons</b> National Council (SCNC) as the executive governing body. Younger activists formed the Southern <b>Cameroons</b> Youth League (SCYL) in Buea on 28 May 1995. The SCNC sent a delegation, led by John Foncha, to the United Nations, which was received on 1 June 1995 and presented a petition against the 'annexation' of the Southern <b>Cameroons</b> by French Cameroun. This was followed by a signature referendum the same year, which the organisers claim produced a 99% vote in favour of independence with 315,000 people voting.|$|R
50|$|After French Cameroun became {{independent}} in January 1960, {{it was decided}} to hold plebiscites in Northern and Southern <b>Cameroons</b> in February 1961. Northern <b>Cameroons</b> opted to join Nigeria, effective from 31 May 1961, and so continued to use Nigerian stamps as before.|$|R
5000|$|Following the Ibadan General Conference of 1950, a new {{constitution}} for Nigeria devolved more power to the regions. In the subsequent election thirteen Southern Cameroonian representatives were elected to the Eastern Nigerian House of Assembly in Enugu. In 1953, however, the Southern <b>Cameroons</b> representatives, unhappy with the domineering attitude of Nigerian politicians and lack of unity among the {{ethnic groups in the}} Eastern Region, declared a [...] "benevolent neutrality" [...] and withdrew from the assembly. At a conference in London from 30 July to 22 August 1953, the Southern <b>Cameroons</b> delegation asked for a separate region of its own. The British agreed, and Southern <b>Cameroons</b> became an autonomous region with its capital still at Buea. Elections were held in 1954 and the parliament met on 1 October 1954, with E.M.L. Endeley as Premier. As Cameroun and Nigeria prepared for Independence, South <b>Cameroons</b> nationalists debated whether their best interests lay with union with Cameroun, union with Nigeria or total independence. Endeley was defeated in elections on 1 February 1959 by John Ngu Foncha. The United Nations organised a plebiscite in the <b>Cameroons</b> on 11 February 1961 which put two alternatives to the people: union with Nigeria or union with Cameroun. The third option, independence, was opposed by the UK representative to the UN Trusteeship Council, Sir Andrew Cohen, and as a result was not put. In the plebiscite, Northern <b>Cameroons</b> voted for union with Nigeria, and Southern <b>Cameroons</b> for union with (the formerly French) Cameroun.|$|R
5|$|<b>Cameroon</b> {{experiences}} {{relatively high}} {{political and social}} stability. This has permitted the development of agriculture, roads, railways and large petroleum and timber industries. Large numbers of Cameroonians live as subsistence farmers, however. Since 1982 Paul Biya has been President, governing with his <b>Cameroon</b> People's Democratic Movement party. The country has experienced tensions coming from the English-speaking territories. Politicians in the English-speaking regions have advocated for greater decentralisation and even complete separation or independence (as in the Southern Cameroons National Council) from <b>Cameroon.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Cameroon</b> {{has four}} {{patterns}} of drainage. In the south, the principal rivers are the Ntem, Nyong, Sanaga, and Wouri. These flow southwestward or westward {{directly into the}} Gulf of Guinea. The Dja and Kadéï drain southeastward into the Congo River. In northern <b>Cameroon,</b> the Bénoué River runs north and west and empties into the Niger. The Logone flows northward into Lake Chad, which <b>Cameroon</b> shares with three neighbouring countries.|$|E

50|$|In 1951, Endeley {{was elected}} to the Eastern Nigerian Assembly in Enugu. He worked to have Southern <b>Cameroons</b> granted special {{regional}} status apart from Nigeria; when the Southern <b>Cameroons</b> Regional Assembly was formed, he was one of its first members. In 1953, Endeley joined John Ngu Foncha and Solomon Tandeng Muna in breaking from the National Council of Nigeria and the <b>Cameroons</b> (NCNC) to form the Kamerun National Congress (KNC), which advocated autonomy for Southern <b>Cameroons.</b> However, Endley's political views changed, and he advocated greater integration of the territory with Nigeria. In 1955, Foncha and Muna broke with the KNC to form the separatist Kamerun National Democratic Party (KNDP). Endeley allied the KNC with the Kamerun's People Party (KPP), another pro-Nigeria group, but the coalition lost seats to the KNDP.|$|R
5|$|The {{quality of}} health care is {{generally}} low. In <b>Cameroon,</b> {{there is only one}} doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization. Due to financial cuts in the health care system, there are few professionals. Doctors and nurses who were trained in <b>Cameroon,</b> emigrate because in <b>Cameroon</b> the payment is poor while the workload is high. Nurses are unemployed even though their help is needed. Some of them help out voluntarily so they will not lose their skills. Outside the major cities, facilities are often dirty and poorly equipped.|$|E
