40|$|The defect <b>containment</b> <b>measure</b> is {{traditionally}} {{used to provide}} insight into project success (or lack thereof) at capturing defects early in the project life cycle, i. e., the time when defect repair costs are at their minimum. Although the measure does {{provide insight into the}} effectiveness of early defect capture techniques (such as peer reviews), defect containment in its most common form (percentage of defects captured) is a lagging indicator as its ultimate value cannot be known until a project is complete. At that point, it is too late for a project to take corrective action. Using raw defect containment data and deriving Quantitative Defect Management (QDM) measures early in the development life cycle provides opportunities for a project to identify issues in defect capture before costs spiral out of control, schedule delays ensue, and another Death March begins [1].

In 2003, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) began to quantify the impacts of skunk-variant rabies and to assess the feasibility of using oral rabies vaccination (ORV) as a <b>containment</b> <b>measure.</b> The CDPH rabies case data for skunks were spatially depicted and analyzed using a geographic information system. Statewide, rabid skunks (1992 – 2003) primarily occurred in seven physiographic regions: Central Coast, North Coast, North Sierra, Sacramento Valley, San Francisco Bay and Delta, San Joaquin Valley, and South Sierra. Detailed analysis of rabid skunks in San Luis Obispo (SLO) and Santa Barbara (SB) counties showed that skunk rabies was endemic in the coastal plain of SLO County between 1992 and 2000, but only became epizootic in SB County during 2002. Despite the widespread distribution of striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) throughout most of California, the skunk rabies variant has not been found in Los Angeles County since 1979.

The global average for residue storage can cover in excess of 2. 1 million square metres per refinery and is increasing annually by 300 to 400 thousand square metres. Residue {{has the potential to}} damage surface and groundwater quality due to the residue’s high alkalinity. Bauxite residue drying areas (RDAs) need to be designed {{in a manner that is}} safe for the population and the natural environment. Currently, RDA construction practice relies on the placement of a minimum of two clay lifts, a constructed low permeability base and an embankment seal that is at least equivalent to a 0. 5 m depth of mechanically compacted clay with a permeability coefficient of less than 10 - 9 m/sec. This is overlain with a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geomembrane, as the primary seal against seepage of caustic liquor. In Western Australia it is becoming increasingly difficult to source sufficient clay for future RDA constructionTo continue to meet and improve on current community and environmental standards, this investigation proposes an alternative to the clay lining system.

40|$|Abstract Background During {{the very}} early stage of the 2009 pandemic, mass {{chemoprophylaxis}} was implemented as part of <b>containment</b> <b>measure.</b> The purposes {{of the present study}} were to systematically review the retrospective studies that investigated the effectiveness of antiviral prophylaxis during the 2009 pandemic, and to explicitly estimate the effectiveness by employing a mathematical model. Methods A systematic review identified 17 articles that clearly defined the cases and identified exposed individuals based on contact tracing. Analysing a specific school-driven outbreak, we estimated the effectiveness of antiviral prophylaxis using a renewal equation model. Other parameters, including the reproduction number and the effectiveness of antiviral treatment and school closure, were jointly estimated. Results Based on the systematic review, median secondary infection risks (SIRs) among exposed individuals with and without prophylaxis were estimated at 2. 1 % (quartile: 0, 12. 2) and 16. 6 % (quartile: 8. 4, 32. 4), respectively. A very high heterogeneity in the SIR was identified with an estimated I 2 statistic at 71. 8 %. From the outbreak data in Madagascar, the effectiveness of mass chemoprophylaxis in reducing secondary transmissions was estimated to range from 92. 8 % to 95. 4 % according to different model assumptions and likelihood functions, not varying substantially as compared to other parameters. Conclusions Only based on the meta-analysis of retrospective studies with different study designs and exposure settings, it was not feasible to estimate the effectiveness of antiviral prophylaxis in reducing transmission. However, modelling analysis of a single outbreak successfully yielded an estimate of the effectiveness that appeared to be robust to model assumptions. Future studies should fill the data gap that has existed in observational studies and allow mathematical models to be used for the analysis of meta-data. </p...|$|R
