The case involved a countervailing duty measure imposed by Mexico on imports of olive oil from the European Communities (in particular, Spain and Italy). The dispute raised important issues regarding the determination of <b>causation</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury,</b> as neither the panel nor the investigating authority gave much credence to evidence that the main complaint of the domestic industry was {{the loss of a}} distribution agreement and brand name rights with a Spanish exporter.

40|$|Background: Investigations {{into the}} context and <b>causation</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury,</b> {{including}} injury risks, are {{an essential part}} of the injury prevention knowledge base. Caregiver perceptions of childhood injury risks may assist in the design of safety interventions and influence the way in which an intervention is received within a community. Methods: Focus groups and individual interviews were conducted in two low-income neighbourhoods in South Africa to collect information on caregiver perceptions of injury risks. The data were analysed via thematic content analysis. Results: The results revealed that injury risks are perceived as multifaceted and as contributing synergistically to an injury event. Parents of children also tended to attribute most risks to the environment instead of individual action.

40|$|The {{principle}} of individual responsibility {{is one of}} the foundations of tort law, and indeed of the common law in general. Recently, however, court decisions and scholarly commentary, particularly on the issue of actual <b>causation</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury,</b> indicate a shift away from the {{principle of}} individual responsibility in torts toward what can be termed group, or community, responsibility. While the dimensions of this shift are as yet limited, its implications are immense: it calls into question fundamental premises regarding the nature of the individual and the individual 2 ̆ 7 s relationship to society. This Article addresses the emerging shift in tort law from individual to group responsibility, and its legal, political, and philosophical implications. After tracing the shift and describing the generally confused and hostile responses that it has evoked, I demonstrate that the shift is justified by, and intuitively expresses, a revision of the political theory of the individual and society that underlies present conceptions of legal responsibility. I conclude that the shift to group responsibility is a positive development, but one that must be understood and applied much more critically than courts or commentators have done thus far...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the actual}} and {{potential}} effects of toxic substance pollution upon human health, the United States Congress has never enacted a comprehensive victim compensation system.

From a policy standpoint, legislation is needed that produces information and standards on causation which assist both victims and industry.

To do so, however, the Congress must recognize scientific uncertainty as an omnipresent element of causation in cases of toxic substance pollution.

40|$|There is a {{substantial}} body {{of work in the}} scientific literature discussing the role of risk-taking behavior in the <b>causation</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury.</b> Despite the quantity of diverse writings on the subject most {{is in the form of}} theoretical commentaries. This review was conducted to critically assess the empirical evidence supporting the association between injury and risk-taking behavior. The review found six case-control studies and one retrospective cohort study, which met all the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis was not possible due to the diversity of the independent and outcome variables in each of the studies reviewed. Overall the review found that risk-taking behavior, however it is measured, is associated with an increased chance of sustaining an injury except in the case of high skilled, risk-taking sports where the effect may be in the other direction. Drawing specific conclusions from the research presented in this review is difficult without an agreed conceptual framework for examining risk-taking behavior and injury. Considerable work needs to be done to provide a convincing evidence base on which to build public health interventions around risk behavior. However, sufficient evidence exists to suggest that effort in this area may be beneficial for the health of the community. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Risk taking {{behaviour}} {{has been}} identified as an important host-related determinant of injury in young adults. The aim {{of this study is to}} clarify the relationship between the two key elements of risk taking behaviour - ie, risk assessment and risk acceptance - in participants of a high risk sporting activity. Skydivers registered with the Australian Parachute Federation were sampled at several jump meetings held at three 'drop-zones' in North Eastern Australia. A cross sectional survey of 215 skydivers ascertained each subject's risk assessment of each of nine hypothetical sky diving scenes and whether or not they would jump in the described conditions. Variables which independently predicted an individual's risk assessment were age group (p< 0. 05), gender (p< 0. 05) and scene details (p< 0. 001). Risk assessment was found to be a statistically significant predictor of the decision to jump, with a 22 % decrease in the odds of jumping with every unit increase in risk assessment (OR= 0. 78 : 95 % CI; 0. 76, 0. 80). Gender was also found to be a statistically significant predictor of the decision to jump, with males being 19 % more likely to jump than females, after controlling for age, experience, currency and risk assessment (OR= 1. 19 : 95 % CI; 1. 04, 1. 38).

40|$|Courts {{around the}} world are {{increasingly}} considering whether liability should exist in various types of situations in which a plaintiff can prove that a defendant’s tortious conduct {{may have contributed to the}} plaintiff’s injury, but it is inherently impossible, given the nature of the situation, for the plaintiff to prove that the defendant’s tortious conduct actually contributed to the injury. The problematic nature of the causal issue is usually recognized when the probability of causation is not greater than 50 percent, with courts adopting different views, depending on the type of situation, on whether liability nevertheless is appropriate and, if so, whether liability should be full or only proportionate to the probability of causation. However, when the probability of causation is only slightly higher—greater than 50 percent—many courts do not view either causation or liability as being problematic. Indeed, under the commonly accepted version of the res ipsa loquitur doctrine, liability is assumed to be unproblematic even though the only indication of negligent conduct as well as causation is a mere 50 + percent ex ante statistical probability. The dramatic difference in treatment of situations that are identical except for a trivial difference in statistical probability is due to an unexamined assumption that the usual “preponderance of the evidence” or “balance of probabilities” burden of persuasion in civil cases merely requires proof of a 50 + percent statistical probability. This assumption, which is common among academics as well as courts but is rejected by courts when the statistical rather than case-specific nature of the probability is obvious, has led to inconsistent and incoherent treatment of normatively and descriptively analogous types of situations and even to erroneous denials of proof of causation and liability in some situations in which tortious causation clearly exists. The statistical probability interpretation of the burden of persuasion in civil cases is inconsistent with the traditional understanding of that burden, which instead requires the formation of a minimal degree of belief, based on evidence specific to the particular occasion, in the actual existence of the disputed fact in the particular situation. When the disputed fact is actual <b>causation</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury,</b> there must be a minimal belief that the causal law underlying the allegedly applicable causal generalization was fully instantiated on the particular occasion. General statistics cannot support such a belief; only concrete evidence specific to the particular situation can do so. Only when the burden of persuasion is correctly understood can many currently debated issues regarding the existence and scope of tort liability be properly understood and consistently resolved. When the various types of problematic situations are compared, it turns out that the market share liability principles adopted in Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories and, arguably, Hymowitz v. Eli Lilly 2 ̆ 6 Co., which are highly controversial, are more defensible than the liability principles that are widely employed in the alternative causation cases, the medical malpractice lost-chance cases, the toxic tort cases, and, especially, in the usual formulation of the res ipsa loquitur doctrine...|$|E

40|$|Background: Injury as a {{cause of}} {{significant}} morbidity and mortality has remained fairly stable in countries with developed economies. Although injury prevention often is conceptualised as a biomedical construct, such a reductionist perspective overlooks the importance of the psychological, environmental, and sociocultural conditions as contributing factors to injury and its consequences. This paper describes the potential of the ecological model for understanding the antecedent causes <b>of</b> unintentional <b>injuries</b> and guiding injury prevention approaches. We review the origins and conceptualise the elements of the ecological model and conclude with some examples of applications of ecological approaches to the prevention <b>of</b> unintentional <b>injury</b> and promotion <b>of</b> community safety. Methods: A review of the English-language literature on the conceptualization of ecological models in public health and injury prevention, including the application of the ecological model in the prevention of falls and road traffic injuries and in the community safety promotion movement.

40|$|ALTHOUGH it is {{generally}} agreed that birth injury is responsible {{for at least some}} of the spastic and athetoid forms of cerebral palsy, much uncertainty exists as to the ways in which the underlying lesions have been brought about.

This hypothesis finds its most plausible field of application in explaining the localization of those bilateral lesions of cerebral cortex, basal ganglia or centrum semiovale which lie within the drainage areas of the sagittal sinus or of the great vein of Galen.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{establish}} the demographics <b>of</b> ski <b>injury</b> {{in relation to}} age, gender, and perceived cause during a representative season to identify potential injury prevention strategies. SETTING: Blackcomb Mountain, a world class ski resort in British Columbia, Canada. METHODS: Data were collected from the lift ticket records and from ski patrol injury reports for one season, November to May 1991 - 2. RESULTS: There were 720, 066 skier and snowboarder day visits counted by the mountain's lift ticket records, with a total <b>of</b> 2, 092 <b>injury</b> reports (incidence 2. 91 per 1, 000 day visits). Of those with significant injuries (those requiring physician care), 1, 210 (58 %) were male. The highest injury rate was among children (age 7 - 12) and teens (age 13 - 17) with incidences of 3. 18 and 3. 34 significant injuries per 1, 000 skier days, respectively. Head and face injuries constituted 17 % and 22 % <b>of</b> <b>injuries,</b> respectively in these groups. Overall 22 % of head and face injuries were severe enough to cause loss of consciousness or clinical signs of concussion. This was the body region injured most frequently in males.

It measures nonfatal work injury as an episode <b>of</b> work <b>injury,</b> using the data from the 1988 Occupational Health Supplement (1988 OHS) to the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). First, this study confirms no association between race and nonfatal injury at work. Second, the findings show that human capital, expressed through education and work experience, is the crucial determinant <b>of</b> nonfatal <b>injury</b> at work. In general, workers of more years of schooling and more work experience encounter less nonfatal injury at work than their counterparts. Third, the results also demonstrate the significance of occupational conditions (occupational positions and work activity) for nonfatal injury at work. Specifically, workers in professional occupations experience less work injury than workers in production occupations, but more work injury than workers engaged in clerical jobs. Even after controlling for occupational positions, there is a significant correlation between work activity and nonfatal work injury. Our study is a first step towards the <b>causation</b> <b>of</b> nonfatal <b>injury</b> on the job in terms of race, human capital, and occupational conditions.

Bismuth classification is helpful {{in most of the}} cases. Immediate referral to a centre experienced in the management <b>of</b> bile duct <b>injury</b> and timely intervention is associated with improved outcomes. Resuscitation, correcting dyselectrolytemia, aspiration of undrained biloma and antibiotics take the priority in the management. The goal is to restore the bile conduit, and to prevent short and longterm complications such as biliary fistula, intra-abdominal abscess, biliary stricture, recurrent cholangitis and secondary biliary cirrhosis. Endoscopic therapy by reducing the transpapillary pressure gradient helps in reducing the leak. Endoscopic therapy with biliary sphincterotomy alone or with additional placement of a biliary stent/ nasobiliary drainage is advocated. In our tertiary care referral unit, we found endoscopic interventions are useful in situations where there is leak with associated CBD calculus or a foreign body, peripheral bile duct injury, cystic duct stump leak and partial bile duct injury with leak/ narrowing of the lumen. Endotherapy is not useful in case of complete transection (total cut off) and complete stricture involving common hepatic or common bile ducts.

PTSD stands apart from all other diagnoses in psychiatry 2 ̆ 7 s standard classification system, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM, and is the focus of significant controversy within psychiatry, because its diagnostic criteria require a determination <b>of</b> <b>causation.</b> By diagnosing a person with PTSD, a clinician necessarily assigns responsibility to a specific event or agent for causing the person 2 ̆ 7 s symptoms, a practice more commonly associated with law. In short, the diagnosis uniquely medicalizes liability.

These uses include determining whether a criminal complainant is credible and when emotional distressfrom another 2 ̆ 7 s negligence is sufficient in itselfto serve as a basis for liability.

40|$|A needlestick {{injury is}} defined by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) as a {{percutaneous}} injury due to accidental handling of a sharp. The CDC estimates that approximately 400, 000 needlestick incidences occur each year in United States healthcare facilities, and reports from other developed countries, such as the United Kingdom and Spain, share similar frequencies. Further, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates two million international healthcare workers are exposed annually to infectious disease as a consequence of a needlestick event, resulting in 37. 6 % and 39 % of hepatitis B and hepatitis C cases, respectively. In the United States, federal and state legislation have greatly reduced incidence rates since the late 1980 s, providing education, better protocols and effective post-exposure management. Additionally, the introduction of national surveillance databases led to stronger epidemiological support for the <b>causation</b> <b>of</b> needlestick <b>injury</b> and consequently, a stronger national awareness. In an effort to better protect healthcare workers, corporations such as DuPont and BD have further reduced needlestick incidences in the United States by designing products ranging from safety-engineered syringes to adhesive strips surrounded in strong synthetic materials such as Kevlar® and Lycra®. These devices are instrumental in minimizing the needlestick problem in both the clinic and in the operating room. As part of the current United States legislation, healthcare organizations are mandated to implement and utilize these safety-engineered syringes and needles. Despite the rise in protective equipment, national database surveillance and federal/state legislature, the incidence rate remains high as hundreds <b>of</b> thousands <b>of</b> <b>injuries</b> persist each year. We sought to find other solutions for better protecting healthcare workers through the implementation of golden orb weaver spider silk in personal protective equipment. This silk, gathered from the Nephila clavipes, is one of the strongest and toughest biomaterials in known existence. Its characteristically high energy absorption makes it an ideal material for reinforcing gloves and other protective equipment for healthcare workers. We believe that products made from this silk would serve as strong barriers against needlestick injury and bloodborne pathogen exposure. We {{are in the process of}} designing and fabricating such a glove and completed preliminary strength testing to ensure the superiority of our material. Tensile testing conducted at Tufts' Department of Biomedical Engineering suggests that our silk possesses the same mechanical profile as N. clavipes silk found in published literature. We plan on utilizing Fourier-transform infrared (DSC-FTIR) microspectroscopy to study the protein structure and possibly conducting enzyme degradation assays to assess the property changes under unique conditions. This information combined with our patented extraction and reinforcing methodology will provide the groundwork for partnering with industry leaders to make this product a reality and help eliminate the incidence <b>of</b> needlestick <b>injury...</b>|$|R
