When it flowers it is time for marriage. Gifts are left at the tree periodically and when the individual dies, their spirit is believed to live on in the tree.|$|E

Each had mixed feelings about whether {{there would be a}} series commission after the poor reception of the pilot; Ripley did not stop thinking about it, in contrast to Bathurst, who viewed it as just another failed pilot he had done.|$|E

5|$|The Buddhist {{version of}} the Bhasmasura tale {{continues}} with Shiva (Ishvara) asking the female-Vishnu, who is seated on a swing, to marry him. She asks Shiva to get the permission of his wife Umayangana to take her home. Shiva returns with Umayangana's consent to find the female-Vishnu pregnant, who sends him back to get permission to bring a pregnant woman home. When he returns, a <b>child</b> <b>is</b> <b>born</b> and female-Vishnu is pregnant again. She requests Shiva to seek approval to bring a pregnant woman with a child home. This happens six more times. Finally, Shiva brings Umayangana with him to witness the miraculous woman. Vishnu then returns to his male form. Umayangana embraces the six youngest children merging them into the six-headed Skanda, while the eldest, named Aiyanayaka ("eldest brother") remains intact. Aiyanayaka is identified with Aiyanar.|$|E

25|$|The Sh'vut Ya'akov (1:17) {{rules that}} the above-cited custom {{of the father}} fasting for the child goes into effect {{as soon as the}} <b>child</b> <b>is</b> <b>born,</b> except where the <b>child</b> <b>is</b> <b>born</b> after chatzot ha'laila (halakhic midnight, which {{generally}} corresponds to solar midnight) on the 14th of Nisan of that year. (Since the child had not yet been born by the equivalent time that the Plague of the Firstborn had occurred in Egypt, the father need not fast for his child until the following year) The Korban N'tan'el (Pesachim 10:19:80) disagrees. He writes that the custom only goes into effect from the time the child is 30 days old. This relates, again, to the command to redeem the firstborn, which does not go into effect until the child is 30 days old.|$|E

25|$|Thelma learns from Peggy, {{the ghost}} of a woman who died in the 1918 {{influenza}} pandemic, that the gestation of Azazeal's child is weakening the veil between worlds, allowing more ghosts to appear to the living.

25|$|In {{addition}} to these festivals, ceremonies marking rites of passage are also performed within the shrines. Two such ceremonies are {{the birth of a}} child and the Shichi-Go-San. When a <b>child</b> <b>is</b> <b>born</b> they are brought to a shrine so that they can be initiated as a new believer and the kami can bless them and their future life. The Shichi-Go-San (the Seven-Five-Three) is a rite of passage for five-year-old boys and three- or seven-year-old girls. It is a time for these young children to personally offer thanks for the kami’s protection and to pray for continued health.|$|E

An old Chinese superstition involves a woman who, wishing to have a child, offers a shoe to Guanyin. In Chinese culture, a borrowed shoe sometimes is used when a child is expected. After the <b>child</b> <b>is</b> <b>born,</b> the shoe is returned to its owner along with a new pair as a thank you gift.|$|E

25|$|Parents play a {{vital part}} in a child’s early life, for {{they are the first}} group of people that a child meets and learns from. The {{information}} that surrounds a child at home becomes reinforcements for desired behaviors of a male or female. Studies have shown that as immediate as 24 hours after a <b>child</b> <b>is</b> <b>born</b> most parents have already engaged in gender stereotypic expectations of sons or daughters. Through examples such as painting a room pink or blue, encouragement to participate in shared sex-typed activities, offering gender differentiated toys, or treating the opposite sex child differently, these parent-child interactions have long lasting influence on how a child connects to certain gender-specific behaviors.|$|E
25|$|Parental {{alcoholism}} {{may affect}} the fetus even before a <b>child</b> <b>is</b> <b>born.</b> In pregnant women, alcohol is carried {{to all of the}} mother’s organs and tissues, including the placenta, where it easily crosses through the membrane separating the maternal and fetal blood systems. When a pregnant woman drinks an alcoholic beverage, the concentration of alcohol in her unborn baby’s bloodstream is the same level as her own. A pregnant woman who consumes alcohol during her pregnancy may give birth to a baby with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). FAS (fetal alcohol syndrome) is known to produce children with damage to the central nervous system, general growth and facial features. The prevalence of this class of disorder is thought to be between 2-5 per 1000.|$|E
