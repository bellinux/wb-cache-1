To measure corrosion rate {{as a function of}} beam time, it is necessary to electrical isolate the corrosion electrode to be examined form the plumbing system. Conventionally, this is accomplished with glass seals. Here irradiation of the glass may cause it to become conductive, rendering the seal useless.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the method of}} an indirect detection of a MCP charge avalanche projected onto a resistive layer (G. Battistoni, et al., Nucl. Instr. and Meth., 202 (1982) 459). If the sheet resistance is favourable one can detect the charge cloud by the capacitive coupling to an anode structure a few millimetres behind the layer. The anode structure can be, for example, a wedge-and-strip electrode pattern (M. Unverzagt, Diplomarbeit, Universit. at Frankfurt 1992, private communication) as it is used for directly collecting the electron avalanche from a MCP. Detection of the induced charge is beneficial in several respects. Firstly, image distortions produced by secondary electron mediated charge redistribution are eliminated. Secondly, the noise component due to quantized charge collection, {{commonly referred to as}} partition noise, is not present. In addition, the dielectric substrate can function both as an element of the vacuum enclosure and HV insulator, making the electrical connections easily accessible and the pattern operable at ground potential, independently of detector operating voltages. This technique can be used to simplify the electronic design requirements where varying high voltages are required at the detector input face such as plasma analysers, etc. It also has application in the manufacture of intensifier tubes (J.

40|$|Molybdenum and alumina cermets are {{currently}} being used for small, simple geometry, <b>electrical</b> <b>feed-throughs</b> in insulating alumina ceramic bodies. However, with larger and more complex geometries, high residual stresses and cracking of the alumina ceramic occur {{due to differences in}} coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) between cermet and the surrounding 94 % alumina. The difference in CTE is caused by the Mo in the cermet, which lowers the CTE of the cermet relative to the 94 % alumina ceramic. A study was conducted at Sandia National Laboratories to develop CTE-matched cermets based on binary Mo-V and ternary Mo-V-X alloy systems. It was found that the CTE of 94 % alumina (over the range 1, 000 C to room temperature) could be precisely matched by a binary Mo- 32. 5 V alloy. However, to address concerns regarding the selective oxidation of V, Mo-V-X alloys with CTE`s similar to 94 % alumina were made with Fe or Co additions. The ternary additions are limited to about 3 wt. % to maintain a single phase BCC alloy, and permit some reduction in the V addition. Powders were fabricated from both Mo- 27 V and Mo- 22 V- 3 Fe, and were evaluated in 3 hr. / 1, 625 C cermet sintering trials. The results of those trials suggest that extensive reaction occurs between the Vanadium component of the alloy and the alumina ceramic. In view of these results the authors have begun to evaluate the feasibility of fabricating Iridium alumina cermets. Iridium is an attractive choice due to its close CTE match to 94 % alumina ceramic.

40|$|Time {{dependent}} convective flows during {{crystal growth}} of doped semiconductors lead to fluctuations of the composition, so called dopant striations. In general, {{it is difficult}} to decide which is the main mechanism for the generation of these striations, it might be either the fluctuation of the concentration field in the melt and the extent of the solute boundary layer ahead of the solid-liquid interface or a variation of the growth velocity. Direct access to the concentration field is rather complicated to achieve, especially considering the high process temperature and the chemical activity of liquid silicon. The contribution of growth rate fluctuations to the formation of compositional fluctuations can be determined by measuring microscopic growth rates. The classical method of current pulses requires <b>electrical</b> <b>feed-throughs</b> and good <b>electrical</b> contacts, both are critical issues for the growth of high purity silicon crystals. Using a radiation based heating system, the heating power can be modulated very fast and effectively. We added to the normal heater power a sinusoidal off-set in the frequency range of 1 to 10 Hz, generating a narrow spaced weak rippling in the grown crystals which are superposed to the dopant striations caused by natural and by thermocapillary convection. The pulling speed was varied between 1 and 4 mm/min. The microscope images of etched crystals slices have been analyzed by peak-search algorithms (measuring the spacing between each artificially induced marker) and by FFT. Performing growth experiments under a time-dependent flow regime, fluctuations of the microscopic growth velocity of Delta(v) /v(sub average) up to 50 % have been measured. Damping the time-dependent convection by the use of an axial, static magnetic field of 500 mT, the microscopic growth rate became constant within the resolution limit of this method. The results will be discussed using analytical methods for the calculation of microscopic growth velocity and by comparing them with measurements of temperature fluctuations in the melt during growth experiments itself...|$|R

Detailed specifications are given for achieving uniform/strong bonds to poly-Si and Au bond rings in a bond recipe which includes vacuum pumping, an outgassing step, application of the bond pressure (~ 2. 5 MPa), and heating to 390 C. Micromachined poly-Si Pirani vacuum sensors were developed, characterized and then packaged in the Au-Si eutectic bonding process in order to measuring vacuum pressures. These packages had cavity dimensions of 2. 3 × 2. 3 mm wide with a depth of 90 µm. Yields of 84. 6 % and 94. 1 % were achieved in packages with bond ring widths of 100 and 150 µm. With the use of getters and a pre-bond outgassing step, pressures from < 3. 7 to 23. 3 mTorr were achieved. Furthermore, pressures were shown to remain stable to within ± 5 mTorr for over 3 years of testing, after 100 hours at 150 ºC, and after 50 thermal cycles from - 50 ºC to 150 ºC. Using differential localized heating, {{one of the two}} wafers to be bonded is heated from the backside, and the other is cooled from the backside, so that heat flows through the bond regions while the device regions stay relatively cool.

40|$|International audienceWe numerically model self-potential {{responses}} {{associated with}} periodic pumping test experiments by sequential {{calculation of the}} hydraulic response and the coupled electrical potential. We assume the pumping test experiments with a fully saturated confined aquifer. Application of different excitation functions leads to quasi-linear trends in electrical records whose direction and intensity depend on {{the form of the}} excitation function. The hydraulic response is phase shifted compared to the excitation function; the phase shift increases quasi-linearly with the distance from the pumping well. For the electrical signals, we investigated separately the cases of conducting and insulating casings of the pumping well. For the conducting <b>casing</b> the <b>electrical</b> signals are larger in magnitude than that for the insulating casing; they reproduce the drawdown signals in the pumping well at any distance from the well and exhibit any phase shift with the increased distance. For the insulating <b>casing,</b> the <b>electrical</b> signals are phase shifted and their shape depends on the distance from the pumping well. Three characteristic regimes were found for the phase shift, φ, with the increased distance and for various hydraulic diffusivity values. At small distances φ increases quasi-linearly; at intermediate distances φ attends the value of π/ 2 and stay about this value (for relatively small diffusivity values); and at large distances φ attends the value of π and, stay about this value at larger distances. This behaviour of the electrical signals can be explained by two electrical sources of reverse polarity. They are (i) linear, time independent, and located at the pumping interval of the well; and (ii) volumetric, time dependent, with maximum value located in the aquifer at the distance corresponding to maximum variation of the hydraulic head magnitude with time. We also model the variation of the amplitude and phase of the hydraulic and electrical signals with increased excitation function period, and we show the characteristic periods corresponding to transition of the periodic pumping test regime to the classical pumping test regime, when the excitation function is considered as the step-function. This transition depends on the distance from the pumping well and the hydraulic diffusivity value of aquifer.

40|$|A plasma-enhanced {{chemical}} vapor deposition (PECVD) growth {{technique has}} been developed where the choice of starting substrate was found to influence the electrical characteristics of the resulting carbon nanofiber (CNF) tubes. It has been determined that, if the tubes are grown on refractory metallic nitride substrates, then the resulting tubes formed with dc PECVD are also electrically conducting. Individual CNFs were formed by first patterning Ni catalyst islands using ebeam evaporation and liftoff. The CNFs were then synthesized using dc PECVD with C 2 H 2 :NH 3 = [1 : 4] at 5 Torr and 700 C, and approximately equal to 200 -W plasma power. Tubes were grown directly on degenerately doped silicon substrates with resistivity rho approximately equal to 1 - 5 meterohm-centimeter, as well as NbTiN. The approximately equal to 200 -nanometer thick refractory NbTiN deposited using magnetron sputtering had rho approximately equal to 113 microohm-centimeter and was also chemically compatible with CNF synthesis. The sample was then mounted on a 45 beveled Al holder, and placed inside a SEM (scanning electron microscope). A nanomanipulator probe stage was placed inside the SEM equipped with an <b>electrical</b> <b>feed-through,</b> where tungsten probes were used to make two-terminal electrical measurements with an HP 4156 C parameter analyzer. The positive terminal nanoprobe was mechanically manipulated to physically contact an individual CNF grown directly on NbTiN {{as shown by the}} SEM image in the inset of figure (a), while the negative terminal was grounded to the substrate. This revealed the tube was electrically conductive, although measureable currents could not be detected until approximately equal to 6 V, after which point current increased sharply until compliance (approximately equal to 50 nA) was reached at approximately equal to 9. 5 V. A native oxide on the tungsten probe tips may contribute to a tunnel barrier, which could be the reason for the suppressed transport at low biases. Currents up to approximately 100 nA could be cycled, which are likely to propagate via the tube surface, or sidewalls, rather than the body, which is shown by the I-V in figure (a). Electrical conduction via the sidewalls is a necessity for dc NEMS (nanoelectromechanical system) applications, more so than for the field emission applications of such tubes. During the tests, high conductivity was expected, because both probes were shorted to the substrate, as shown by curve 1 in the I-V characteristic in figure (b). When a tube grown on NbTiN was probed, the response was similar to the approximately equal to 100 nA and is represented by curve 2 in figure (b), which could be cycled and propagated via the tube surface or the sidewalls. However, no measureable currents for the tube grown directly on Si were observed as shown by curve 3 in figure (b), even after testing over a range of samples. This could arise from a dielectric coating on the sidewalls for tubes on Si. As a result of the directional nature of ion bombardment during dc PECVD, Si from the substrate is likely re-sputtered and possibly coats the sidewalls...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA Micromechanical RF ChannelizerbyMehmet AkgulDoctor of Philosophy in Engineering - Electrical Engineering and Computer SciencesUniversity of California, BerkeleyProfessor Clark T. -C. Nguyen, ChairThe power {{consumption}} {{of a radio}} generally goes as the number and strength of the RF signals it must process. In particular, a radio receiver would consume much less power if the signal presented to its electronics contained only the desired signal in a tiny percent bandwidth frequency channel, rather than the typical mix of signals containing unwanted energy outside the desired channel. Unfortunately, a lack of filters capable of selecting single channel bandwidths at RF forces the front-ends of contemporary receivers to accept unwanted signals, and thus, to operate with sub-optimal efficiency. This dissertation focuses on {{the degree to which}} capacitive-gap transduced micromechanical resonators can achieve the aforementioned RF channel-selecting filters. It aims to first show theoretically that with appropriate scaling capacitive-gap transducers are strong enough to meet the needed coupling requirements; and second, to fully detail an architecture and design procedure needed to realize said filters. Finally, this dissertation provides an actual experimentally demonstrated RF channel-select filter designed using the developed procedures and confirming theoretical predictions. Specifically, this dissertation introduces four methods that make possible the design and fabrication of RF channel-select filters. The first of these introduces a small-signal equivalent circuit for parallel-plate capacitive-gap transduced micromechanical resonators that employs negative capacitance to model the dependence of resonance frequency on electrical stiffness in a way that facilitates the analysis of micromechanical circuits loaded with arbitrary electrical impedances. The new circuit model not only correctly predicts the dependence of electrical stiffness on the impedances loading the input and output electrodes of parallel-plate capacitive-gap transduced micromechanical device, but does so in a visually intuitive way that identifies current drive as most appropriate for applications that must be stable against environmental perturbations, such as acceleration or power supply variations. Measurements on fabricated devices in fact confirm predictions by the new model of up to 4 × improvement in frequency stability against DC-bias voltage variations for contour-mode disk resonators as the resistance loading their ports increases. By enhancing circuit visualization, this circuit model makes more obvious the circuit design procedures and topologies most beneficial for certain mechanical circuits, e. g., filters and oscillators. The second method enables simultaneous low motional resistance (Rx 70, 000) at 61 MHz using an improved ALD-partial electrode-to-resonator gap filling technique that reduces the Q-limiting surface losses of previous renditions by adding an alumina pre-coating before ALD of the gap-filling high-k dielectric. This effort increases the Q over the ~ 10, 000 of previous renditions by more than 6 × towards demonstration of the first VHF micromechanical resonators in any material, piezoelectric or not, to meet the simultaneous high Q (> 50, 000) and low motional resistance Rx (8, 800 supplied by polysilicon disk resonators employing for the first time capacitive transducer gaps small enough to generate coupling strengths of Cx/Co ~ 0. 1 %, which is a 6. 1 × improvement over previous efforts. The filter structure utilizes electrical tuning to correct frequency mismatches due to process variations, where a dc tuning voltage of 12. 1 V improves the filter insertion loss by 1. 8 dB and yields the desired equiripple passband shape. An electrical equivalent circuit is presented that captures not only the ideal filter response, but also parasitic non-idealities that create <b>electrical</b> <b>feed-through,</b> where simulation of the derived equivalent circuit matches the measured filter spectrum closely both in-band and out-of-band. The combined 2. 7 dB passband insertion loss and 50 dB stopband rejection of the demonstrated 206 -element 0. 09 % bandwidth 223. 4 -MHz differential micromechanical disk filter represents a landmark for capacitive-gap transduced micromechanical resonator technology. This demonstration proves that the mere introduction of small gaps, on the order of 39 nm, goes a long way towards moving this technology from a research curiosity to practical performance specs commensurate with the needs of actual RF channel-selecting receiver front-ends. It also emphasizes the need for tuning and defensive stress-relieving structural design when percent bandwidths and gaps shrink, all demonstrated by the work herein. Perhaps most encouraging is that the models presented in dissertation used to design the filter and predict its behavior seem to be all be spot on. This means that predictions using these models foretelling 1 -GHz filters with sub- 200 &# 8486; impedances enabled by 20 nm-gaps might soon come true, bringing this technology ever closer to someday realizing the ultra-low power channel-selecting communication front-ends targeted for autonomous set-and-forget sensor networks.

40|$|The <b>casing</b> {{of large}} <b>electrical</b> {{generators}} can be deformed slightly by the rotor's magnetic field. The sound emission produced by these periodic deformations, which could possibly exceed guaranteed noise emission limits, is analyzed analytically and numerically. From the deformation of the casing, the normal {{velocity of the}} generator's surface is computed. Taking into account the corresponding symmetry, an analytical solution for the acoustic pressure outside the generator is found {{in terms of the}} Hankel function of second order. The normal velocity of the generator surface provides the required boundary condition for the acoustic pressure and determines the magnitude of pressure oscillations. For the numerical simulation, the nonlinear 2 D Euler equations are formulated in a perturbation form for low Mach number Computational Aeroacoustics (CAA). The spatial derivatives are discretized by the classical sixth-order central interior scheme and a third-order boundary scheme. Spurious high frequency oscillations are damped by a characteristic-based artificial compression method (ACM) filter. The time derivatives are approximated by the classical 4 th-order Runge-Kutta method. The numerical results are in excellent agreement with the analytical solution...|$|R
40|$|Samples of {{microplastic}} (n =  924) {{from two}} beaches in south west England have been analysed by field-portable-x-ray fluorescence (FP-XRF) spectrometry, configured in a low-density mode {{and with a}} small-spot facility, for the heavy metals, Cd and Pb, and the halogen, Br. Primary plastics {{in the form of}} pre-production pellets were the principal type of microplastic (> 70 %) on both beaches, with secondary, irregularly-shaped fragments representing the remainder of samples. Cadmium and Pb were detected in 6. 9 % and 7. 5 % of all microplastics, respectively, with concentrations of either metal that exceeded 10 (3)  μg g(- 1) usually encountered in red and yellow pellets or fragments. Respective correlations of Cd and Pb with Se and Cr were attributed to the presence of the coloured, inorganic pigments, cadmium sulphoselenide and lead chromate. Bromine, detected in 10. 4 % of microplastics and up to concentrations of about 13, 000  μg g(- 1), was mainly encountered in neutrally-coloured pellets. Its strong correlation with Sb, whose oxides are effective fire suppressant synergists, suggests the presence of a variety of brominated flame retardants arising from the recycling of plastics originally used in <b>casings</b> for heat-generating <b>electrical</b> equipment. The maximum bioaccessible concentrations of Cd and Pb, evaluated using a physiological extraction based on the chemical characteristics of the proventriculus-gizzard of the northern fulmar, were about 50  μg g(- 1) and 8  μg g(- 1), respectively. These concentrations exceed those estimated for the diet of local seabirds by factors of about 50 and 4, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Brominated {{flame retardants}} are {{a diverse group}} of chemicals, whose common points are that they all contain bromine and are all use to retard the {{combustibility}} of commercial goods. Two substances &# 8211; decabromodiphenyl ether (DecaDBE) and Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBP-A; this will be the subject of a separate Background Document) &# 8211; account for about 50 % of world use of brominated flame retardants. Two other polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PolyBDE) &# 8211; octabromodiphenyl ether (OctaDBE) and pentabromodiphenyl ether (PentaDBE) &# 8211; are used commercially, but in much smaller quantities than DecaBDE. Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD) is also used in large volumes. Polybrominated biphenyls (PBB) have also been used, but production was stopped in September 2000. Some PolyBDE are toxic, especially those with smaller molecules. PentaDBE may disrupt the oestrogenic system. PBB have similar effects to polychlorinated biphenyls, and may also produce hypothyroidism. Some of these chemicals are bioaccumulated. Brominated flame retardants were given priority in the 1992 OSPAR Action Plan, and therefore included in 1998 in the List of Chemicals for Priority Action. The quantities of PolyBDE used in the EU in 1994 were estimated as: DecaBDE (8 210 tonnes) as a general-purpose flame retardant, especially in polymers, polypropylene fabric and other textiles (other than clothing fabrics); OctaBDE (2 550 tonnes) in acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene plastics (often used for <b>casings</b> of <b>electrical</b> and electronic equipment), nylon and other plastics and in adhesives and coatings; PentaBDE (125 tonnes) mainly in flexible polyurethane foam for furniture, as well as epoxy and phenolic resins, some polyesters and textiles. About 9 200 tonnes of HBCDD was used in the EU in 1999, 85 % of it in polystyrene. Since the products containing these chemicals are widely dispersed, their possible release from waste disposal routes may be of concern, together with their potential role in producing dioxins and furans during waste incineration. The degradation of DecaBDE to the more toxic and bioaccumulative lower levels of PolyBDE is also of concern. The overwhelming majority of samples of marine biota have not shown detectable quantities of DecaBDE; however, OctaBDE has been found in fish and molluscs (up to 325 &# 956;g/kg wet weight) and PentaBDE has been found in fish and marine mammals (up to 7 700 &# 956;g/kg in white-beaked dolphins). All these chemicals have been found in river or marine sediments. Action so far has been mainly through voluntary commitments by industry {{within the framework of the}} OECD. The risk assessment for PentaBDE under the EC existing substances regulation has concluded that risk reduction measures are needed. The PolyBDEs are proposed to be included as priority hazardous substances in the list of priority substances under the EC Water Framework Directive. The action recommended is: to support the inclusion of PBB in the draft EC Directive on Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment; to support early EC harmonised restrictions on PentaBDE; to await the completion of the EC risk assessment of OctaBDE, DecaBDE and HBCDD and seek appropriate risk-reduction strategies in the light of it; to support appropriate provision on PolyBDE in the draft EC Directives on Waste from Electric and Electronic Equipment and on Restrictions on Certain Hazardous Substances in Electric and Electronic Equipment; to develop an OSPAR monitoring strategy for these chemicals; to review by OSPAR in 2003 of the need for further OSPAR measures to supplement the eventual EC measures; and to ask other relevant international forums to take account of the background document. A monitoring strategy for Certain Brominated Flame Retardants has been added to this background document...|$|R
40|$|A new {{bolometer}} system {{using an}} infrared (IR) camera {{has been developed}} to measure the 3 -D structure of plasma radiation. This bolometer is called the IR imaging bolometer (IRIB) and of this diagnostic {{there are two types}} of the mask pattern that are known as the Segmented Mask Infrared Imaging Bolometer (SIB) and the Infrared Imagine Video Bolometer (IRVB). The incident radiation power coming from the plasma is collimated by an aperture and then absorbed by a thin foil located in the vacuum vessel. An IR camera outside of the vacuum vessel measures the temperature rise of the foil by means of the thermal radiation that passes through the vacuum interface by means of an IR vacuum window. Therefore, this system does not use electrical vacuum feed-throughts, and has a very simple design as described above, compared to conventional resistive bolometers. The difference between the two IR bolometer systems is in how the spatial channels are determined. The spatial channels of the SIB foil are physically defined and separated by the segmnented mask and those of the IRVB are determined by numerically dividing up the space on a single large foil exposed to the plasma radiation. 　　In this study, the design, production and installation of the two differential types of IRIB systems were made for LHD. 　　The mask was designed by taking into consideration the incident power of the radiation. For a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio of the detected foil temperature, a thin metal foil was used in the mask, aluminum with a thickness of aobut 0. 8 μm for the SIB system and gold with a thickness of about 1 μm for the IRVB system were selected. The other parts of these systems including the aperture plate, the light shielding pipe and the support of the IR camera were also designed. 　　After the installation of these IR bolometers, an in-situ calibraiton experiment was done. The common parameters for both systems, the calibration factor (K/mW) and the cooling decay times, were measured using a He-Ne laser as a known radiation source. For the SIB system, the calibration was done for each channel and for the IRVB system, a combination of in-situ calibraiton and model profile of the temperature rise of the foil was used. 　　Using these coefficients, the plasma radiation power density at the foil was calculated from the two-dimensional temperature distribution of the foil as measured by the IR camera. This resulted in images of the plasma radiation intensity with a sufficient signal and a time response to demonstrate the usefulness of this two-dimensional diagnostic system for plasma radiation. 　　The merits of the IR bolometer are as follows: 　　 1. Broad two-dimensional radiation brightness profiles are measured by one IR camera using infrared camera imaging technology. 　　 2. <b>Electrical</b> vacuum <b>feed-throughs</b> are not necessary in this system as the information aobut the foil temperature is passed as IR radiation through an IR vacuum window to the IR camera. 　　 3. One IR bolometer has over one hundred spatial channels. 　　 4. For the case of the IRVB, these spatial channels can be determined after the plasma experiments with flexibility depending on the experimental objectives and the conditions of the plasma. 　　In the latter half of this thesis, some experimental results are shown using the IRVB data. At present two IRVBs are installed, one at an upper port and the other at a tangential port, and began to measure the plasma radiation from two directions simultaneously during the 2001 - 2002 experimental campaign in LHD. Both of these IRVB biew the same field period and use a 1 μm thick gold foil. The frame rates of these IR cameras are 15 Hz for that with the tangential views and 60 Hz for that with the view from the upper port. 　　Initial measurements with the IRVB at the tangential port show the variations of the radiative structure as two-dimensional brightness profiles and are compared to data from resistive bolometer arrays, the visible CCD camera and the magnetic field line simulation. Images from two different limiter experiments show the source of the radiation to be localized near the plasma-limiting surface. Also comparison with the magnetic field line calculation shows the structure of a hollow radiation profile in the helical geometry of LHD during standard discharges using the natural helical divertor. In particular, a change in the radiation structure was observed as a continuous series of images or movie made by the IRVB as the discharge passes through assymetric radiative collapse. 　　Finally, using data from the two IRVBs, the three-dimensional position of the radiation source in the field of view of the two cameras was determined during the collapse. The brightness source region of the inboard asymmetric collapse was observed to be below the horizontal midplane at the vertically elongated cross-section of the plasma and this region continued in an axisymmetric manner in the field of view of the two cameras (approximately half of a field period). This was confirmed by qualitative agreement of the measured images with a calculation of the two-dimensional brightness profiles at each camera resulting from an axisymmetric model of the radiation source localized at the lower inboard side of the torus...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Southeast Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership (SECARB) early {{project in}} western Mississippi has been testing {{monitoring}} tools and approaches to document storage efficiency and storage permanence {{under conditions of}} CO 2 EOR as well as downdip injection into brine. Denbury Onshore LLC is host for the study and has brought a depleted oil and gas reservoir, Cranfield Field, under CO 2 flood. Injection was started in July 2008 and has now achieved injection rates greater than 1. 2 million tons/year though 23 wells, with cumulative mass injected as of August, 2010 of 2. 2 million metric tons. Injection is into coarse grained fluvial deposits of the Cretaceous lower Tuscaloosa Formation in a gentle anticline at depths of 3300 m. A team of researchers from 10 institutions has collected data from five study areas, each with a different goal and different spatial and temporal scale. The Phase 2 study began {{at the start of}} injection and has been using pressure and temperature as a tool for assessing permanence mostly in the oil productive interval. Real-time read-out shows high sensitivity to distant changes in injection rate and confirms the geologic model of reservoir compartmentalization. Above-zone pressure monitoring ∼ 120  m above the injection interval is used to test the sensitivity of this approach for documentation of integrity of the confining system in an area of numerous well completions as pressure increase is induced in the reservoir by more than 70 bar. Monitoring of the High Volume Injection Test (HiVIT) area includes repeat measurements of aqueous geochemistry in the injection zone. Rock-water- CO 2 interactions in the reservoir as CO 2 dissolves are minimized by mineral “armoring” by abundant chlorite cement in high permeability reservoir sandstone. Geochemical monitoring of confined freshwater aquifers at depths of 70 – 100  m is underway. Groundwater analysis focuses on assessment of the sensitivity of this method to detect leakage above background variability. A repeat seismic survey of the HiVIT is planned for late 2010 to assess saturation change especially in downdip brine-only areas. A study focused on feasibility of monitoring the shallow subsurface to separate leakage from normal complex surface fluxes is underway at an monitoring array installed in October 2009 to assess the interactions of recharge, soil gas, and shallow groundwater aquifers. Recent well re-entry and tracer injection will provide further information to interpret observed elevated deep-sourced methane. The Detailed Area Study (DAS) is collecting dense time-lapse data from closely-spaced three well array of an injector and two observation wells. The observation wells were completed with fiberglass <b>casing</b> to facilitate <b>electrical</b> resistance tomography (ERT) measurements, and a diverse array of instrumentation was both cemented behind casing and suspended on tubing. Injection started at the DAS December 1, 2009. We have measured pulsed neutron and resistivity via wireline, downhole and above-zone pressure, distributed temperature, and fluid chemistry including introduced pulses of perfluorocarbons, noble gases, and SF 6 as tracers. Between wells, time-lapse crosswell seismic and electrical resistance tomography (ERT) are used to measure saturation change. The goals are to measure changes as fluids evolve from single phase (brine) to two phase (CO 2 –brine) in order to document linkages between pressure and sweep efficiency. A time-lapse VSP survey bridges the vertical resolution and areal coverage between cross-well and surface seismic. The repeat surveys for many tools are scheduled for September, 2010. Reservoir characterization based on cores, historic and new wireline log data, production history, hydrologic tests, fluid analysis, and a three-D seismic survey have been used in multiple numerical models to predict reservoir response in order to design effective monitoring strategies and optimize deployment. History matching of observed response to predicted response is used to interpret results and improve confidence in conceptual models and numerical approaches. Probabilistic methods have been used to assess the significant uncertainties resulting from reservoir heterogeneity. This study is funded by the US Department of Energy, National Energy Technology Laboratory as part of the Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships program.
