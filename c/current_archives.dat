There are 2 ways to check if the Calorimeter Archiver is running, either through the WEB based front end or directly from a command line. Once the archiver is running it can be monitored from a WEB page. This only works with a browser launched from the online machine running the archiver. Each time the browser is reloaded there should be an update reported in the last write check field. You might have to wait a few minutes to see the update.

Through the comparison, we use J 2 EE framework to establish the network information system of university archives based on the components and level of J 2 EE, and use MVC structure to realize network business logic, control logic and classification of data display logic.

The {{aim of this}} paper is to propose a {{theoretical}} reflection on the one of the most representative icons of Western Identity : the homunculus. Popularized in sixteenth century alchemy as well as twenty-first century fiction, a Homunculus is a representation of a small human being and it has historically referred to the creation of a miniature, fully formed human. Currently, in the western imaginary and in some scientific fields, a homunculus may refer to the essential core of human identity as opposed to the latest theories emerged in the social and neurological sciences...|$|E

In the decade of 80 s covenants were signed to create Regional Archives, notedly that of Recôncavo, in the city of Cachoeira, with the intention of decentralizing the administration of the public documents, facing the need of organize and conserve the historical files of the region. Since 1991, by means of the definition and implantation of a new public documents administration policy, the State Government of Bahia, through the Culture and Tourism Secretariat conceded a specific budgetary unit to the old State Public Archives of Bahia.

Kant does not respond to the doubts of the skeptic with the demonstration of the existence of a world outside of us, but rather shows that these doubts are based on a questionable and artificial setting of the relationship between our representations and objects. It is not, in short, to answer the questions raised by the skeptic, but, more radically, to interrogate him skeptical about the legitimacy of the position from which he raises his doubts...|$|E

This article empirically investigates Argentinean trade policy on the wine sector over the last years, in order to understand its effect on export flows. An expanded gravity model was estimated through a Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood estimator, in order to account for heteroskedasticity. The data used refer to Argentinean exports of bottled wine to all main world importers during the period 1997 - 2010, and account for more than 90...|$|E

Recent studies on mining and gender focus predominantly on women and how they are negatively affected by mining. Ethnicity, although a growing asset in struggles on environmental transformations, is hardly included in research on mining. The intertwinement of ethnicity and gender in elaborations on mining is often depicted in literature of development programs and environmental organizations in which indigenous women are homogenized as marginalized victims. We argue, however, for a multidimensional approach on mining that takes into account the institutionalization of gender and ethnicity in mining governance as well as the role of gender and ethnic identities. Feminist political ecology and institutional analysis are pointing the way for such an approach. Furthermore, other relevant categories such as class, age, or status should be considered in the analysis of the complex and multidimensional environmental transformations of the mining sector in Indonesia...|$|E
40|$|The <b>current</b> <b>archives</b> of LAMOST multi-object {{spectrograph}} contain {{millions of}} fully reduced spectra, {{from which the}} automatic pipelines have produced catalogues of many parameters of individual objects, including their approximate spectral classification. This is, however, mostly based on the global shape of the whole spectrum and on integral properties of spectra in given bandpasses, namely presence and equivalent width of prominent spectral lines, while for identification of some interesting object types (e. g. Be stars or quasars) the detailed shape {{of only a few}} lines is crucial. Here the machine learning is bringing a new methodology capable of improving the reliability of classification of such objects even in boundary cases. We present results of Spark-based semi-supervised machine learning of LAMOST spectra attempting to automatically identify the single and double-peak emission of H alpha line typical for Be and B[e] stars. The labelled sample was obtained from archive of 2 m Perek telescope at Ondřejov observatory. A simple physical model of spectrograph resolution was used in domain adaptation to LAMOST training domain. The resulting list of candidates contains dozens of Be stars (some are likely yet unknown), but also a bunch of interesting objects resembling spectra of quasars and even blazars, as well as many instrumental artefacts. The verification of a nature of interesting candidates benefited considerably from cross-matching and visualisation in the Virtual Observatory environment.
