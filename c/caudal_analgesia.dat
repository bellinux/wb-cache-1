40|$|Background: An {{anesthetic}} {{state can}} reduce adverse airway reaction during laryngeal mask airway (LMA) removal in children. However, the anesthetic state has risks of upper airway obstruction or delayed emergence; so possibly less anesthetic depth is advisable. <b>Caudal</b> <b>analgesia</b> reduces {{the requirement of}} anesthetic agents for sedation or anesthesia; {{it is expected to}} reduce the sevoflurane requirement for LMA removal. Therefore, we determined the EC 50 of sevoflurane for LMA removal with <b>caudal</b> <b>analgesia</b> and compared that to the EC 50 without <b>caudal</b> <b>analgesia.</b> Methods: Forty-three unpremedicated children aged 1 to 6 yr were enrolled. They were allocated to receive or not to receive caudal block according to their parents ’ consent. General anesthesia were induced and maintained with sevoflurane and oxygen in air. EC 50 of sevoflurane for a smooth LMA removal with and without <b>caudal</b> <b>analgesia</b> were estimated by the Dixon up-and-down method. The LMA was removed when predetermined end-tidal sevoflurane concentration was achieved, and the sevoflurane concentration of a subsequent patient was determined by {{the success or failure of}} the previous patient with 0. 2 % as the step size; success was defined by the absence of an adverse airway reaction during and after LMA removal. EC 50 of sevoflurane with caudal block, and that without caudal block, were compared by a rank-sum test. Results: The EC 50 of sevoflurane to achieve successful LMA removal in children with caudal block was 1. 47 %; 1. 81 % without caudal block. The EC 50 were significantly different between the two groups (P < 0. 001).

Ten 12 – 18 -month-old camels were randomly divided into two equal groups. In group L, the animals received 2 % lidocaine (0. 22 mg/kg) and in group LK the animals received a mixture of 10 % ketamine (1 mg/kg) and 2 % lidocaine (0. 22 mg/kg) administered into the first intercoccygeal (Co 1 –Co 2) epidural space while standing. Onset time and duration of <b>caudal</b> <b>analgesia,</b> sedation level and ataxia were recorded after drug administration. Data were analysed by U Mann-Whitney tests and significance was taken as p < 0. 05. The results showed that epidural lidocaine and co-administration of lidocaine and ketamine produced complete analgesia in the tail, anus and perineum. Epidural administration of the lidocaine-ketamine mixture resulted in mild to moderate sedation, whilst the animals that received epidural lidocaine alone were alert and nervous during the study. Ataxia was observed in all test subjects and was slightly more severe in camels that received the lidocaine-ketamine mixture.

40|$|Background: One of {{the most}} {{commonly}} used regional anesthetic techniques in pediatric surgeries is the caudal epidural block. Its main disadvantage remains the short duration of action. Hence, different additives have been used. Dexmedetomidine is a potent as well as highly selective α 2 adrenergic receptor agonist. The aim of this randomized, double-blinded, study was to compare the duration of postoperative <b>analgesia</b> of <b>caudal</b> dexmedetomidine versus morphine in combination with bupivacaine in pediatric patients undergoing lower abdominal or perineal surgery. Patients and Methods: A total of 50 pediatric patients 1 - 5 years old The American Society of Anesthesiologists status I, II scheduled for lower abdominal and perineal surgeries were included in the study. The patients were enrolled into 2 equal groups: Group A patients (n = 25) received dexmedetomidine with bupivacaine while Group B patients (n = 25) received morphine with bupivacaine. Patients were placed in a supine position then inhalational general anesthesia was induced, and laryngeal mask airway (LMA) was placed. Patients were then given <b>caudal</b> epidural <b>analgesia.</b> By the end of surgery reversal of muscle relaxation was done and the LMA was removed. Post-operatively, the sedation as well as pain score were observed and recorded. Results: The current study showed that minor complications were recorded in the post-anesthesia care unit; in addition, significantly longer periods of analgesia and sedation were detected in Group A. However, no significant differences in demographic data, {{as well as in the}} duration of surgery, and the time of emergence from anesthesia and patient condition during recovery were detected. Conclusion: The present study suggested that use of dexmedetomidine, during single dose injection, as an additive to the local anesthetic bupivacaine in <b>caudal</b> epidural <b>analgesia</b> prolongs the duration of post-operative analgesia following lower abdominal as well as perineal surgery compared with caudal morphine with no side-effects on the vital signs.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the intraoperative hemodynamics, postoperative analgesia, postoperative rescue analgesic requirement, postoperative sedation and side-effects of clonidine and midazolam used as adjuvants to bupivacaine for <b>caudal</b> <b>analgesia.</b> Material and Methods: Following approval from Institutional Ethical Research Committee, 75 American Society of Anesthesiologists I and II patients aged between 1 and 7 years undergoing various elective infra-umbilical surgical procedures were included in this study. The patients were randomly allocated into three groups of 25 patients each. Group B received 1 ml/kg 0. 25 % bupivacaine in normal saline, Group BC received 1 ml/kg 0. 25 % bupivacaine + 1 μg/kg clonidine in normal saline, and Group BM received 1 ml/kg 0. 25 % bupivacaine + 30 μg/kg midazolam in normal saline. The various parameters studied were intraoperative hemodynamic changes, duration of postoperative analgesia, postoperative sedation, postoperative analgesic requirement, and incidence of side-effects. Results: All the groups were similar with respect to patient and block characteristics. The hemodynamic parameters before and after administering <b>caudal</b> <b>analgesia</b> were also comparable. The mean duration of analgesia was 724. 80 ± 60. 29 min in Group BC, 605. 40 ± 82. 37 min in Group BM and 295. 00 ± 41. 78 min in Group B. Thus, the duration of analgesia was significantly prolonged in Group BC compared to Groups BM and B. The FLACC pain score was higher in Group B at the end of 4 th, 8 th and 12 th h compared with Group BC and Group BM. Furthermore at the end of 12 th h, pain scores were significantly higher in Group BM compared to Group BC. Only 1 child in Group BC received three rescue medications compared to 15 (60 %) children in Group B and 7 (28 %) children in Group BM. None of the groups were treated for bradycardia or hypotension and no significant sedation was noted. Conclusion: This study showed that the addition of both clonidine (1 μg/kg) and midazolam (30 μg/kg) with bupivacaine administered caudally significantly increase the duration of postoperative analgesia with minimal side-effects in children. The use of clonidine as an additive to bupivacaine in caudal epidural is a superior choice to midazolam as it reduces the demand of postoperative rescue analgesics significantly...|$|E

Aims: (1) To study and compare the dose requirements of propofol using caudal epidural analgesia. (2) To calculate the efficacy of propofol as maintenance anesthetic agent in both groups and to compare hemodynamic stability of patients in both the techniques. Settings and Design: In our study, after administering general anesthesia to pediatric patients, we have administered <b>caudal</b> <b>analgesia</b> and IV analgesia to monitor the requirement of intra-operative propofol infusion using BIS monitor with a target value of 40 - 60 in both groups. Materials and Methods: 82 patients (aged between 3 and 6 years) have been selected undergoing infra-umbilical surgery and randomly allocated into two groups containing 41 patients in each group. Both the groups group B and group A then intubated with glycopyrrolate, 2 mg/kg injection fentanyl, propofol till loss of verbal contact and atracurium at the rate of 0. 5 mg/kg and group B has been administered caudal epidural blockade with 1 ml/kg 0. 2 % ropivacaine. Propofol infusion at the rate of 10 mg/kg/h is given as maintenance. BIS value has been recorded throughout and propofol requirement at the end of surgery has been calculated. Statistical Analysis Used: Numerical variables between groups have been analyzed using the Student′s t-test and the Mann-Whitney U-test as applicable. Categorical variables have been analyzed using the Pearson′s Chi-square test. P 0. 05), whereas at the end of the operation in the group A is 11. 33 ± 0. 17 and group B is 7. 83 ± 0. 63, which is statistically significant (P < 0. 05). Incidence of adverse effects is statistically insignificant between the two groups. The time for administration of rescue analgesic is 2. 1 ± 0. 88 in group A and 6. 5 ± 0. 17 in group B, which is statistically significant due to <b>caudal</b> <b>analgesia.</b> Conclusions: We conclude that in BIS-monitored patients (3 - 6 years) with infra-umbilical surgeries have shown a reduction in consumption of IV propofol due to caudal epidural blockade...|$|E
40|$|In this prospective, randomized, {{double-blind}} study, {{we evaluated}} the perioperative analgesic efficacy of caudal ketamine {{with or without}} bupivacaine in 62 American Society of Anesthesiologists I-II children undergoing lower abdominal surgery. Patients were randomized into three groups, and all blocks were placed under general anesthesia. Group 1 (n= 20) had caudal injection of plain 0. 125 % bupivacaine 1 mlkg(- 1). Group 2 (n= 22) received caudal ketamine 0. 5 mgkg(- 1) diluted with 0. 9 % saline using the same weight-related volumes. Group 3 (n= 20) received a similar dose of ketamine mixed with 0. 125 % bupivacaine 1 mlkg(- 1). No supplementary intraoperative analgesic was required {{in any of the}} groups. Patients in group 3 had the longest duration of analgesia compared to the other two groups. There {{was no significant difference in}} the incidence of side effects among the three groups.

40|$|Objective- To {{compare the}} time of onset, {{duration}} of action {{and the extent of}} analgesia produced by a lidocaine/xylazine combination with that produced by lidocaine and xylazine alone after injection into the caudal extradural space of the Iranian river buffalo. Design- Observer-blind prospective descriptive trial, Latin square design. Animals- Eleven adult (aged over 2 years) female non-gravid healthy Iranian river buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis), weighing from 450 to 650 kg. Procedure- <b>Caudal</b> extradural <b>analgesia</b> was achieved in buffaloes on 3 occasions at 14 -day intervals by injection of 2 % lidocaine (L; 0. 22 mg kg- 1), 2 % xylazine (X; 0. 05 mg kg- 1), and a combination of 2 % lidocaine(0. 22 mg kg- 1) / 2 % xylazine (LX; 0. 05 mg kg- 1) in a Latin square design. Analgesia was determined by the lack of response to pin-prick and haemostat pressure in the skin of the caudal areas. Results- Onset of analgesia for X was significantly longer (5. 5 ± 0. 7 minutes) than that for L or LX. Duration of analgesia was significantly longer for LX (172. 3 ± 17. 7 minutes) than for either drug used alone (lidocaine, 79. 5 ± 5. 7 minutes; xylazine, 136. 4 ± 11. 4 minutes). I...|$|R
40|$|Background: Various {{options are}} {{available}} {{for the provision of}} analgesia following major surgical procedures including systemic opioids and regional anesthetic techniques. Regional anesthetic techniques offer the advantage of providing analgesia while avoiding the deleterious adverse effects associated with opioids including nausea, vomiting, sedation and respiratory depression. Although used commonly in infants and children, there is a paucity of experience with the use of caudal epidural blockade in adolescents. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the perioperative care of adolescents undergoing major urologic or orthopedic surgical procedures for whom a caudal epidural block was placed for postoperative analgesia. Results: The cohort for the study included 5 adolescents, ranging in age from 13 to 18 years and in weight from 42 to 71 kilograms. <b>Caudal</b> epidural <b>analgesia</b> was accomplished after the induction of anesthesia and {{prior to the start of}} the surgical procedure using 20 - 25 mL of either 0. 25 % bupivacaine or 0. 2 % ropivacaine with clonidine (1 μg/kg). The patients denied pain the recovery room. The time to first request for analgesia varied from 12 to 18 hours with the patients requiring 1 - 3 doses of analgesic agents during the initial 24 postoperative hours. Conclusions: Our preliminary experience demonstrates the efficacy of caudal epidural block in providing analgesia following major urologic and orthopedic surgical procedures. The applications of this technique as a means of providing postoperative analgesia are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Beginning in October 1941, Robert Andrew Hingson (19131996), Waldo B. Edwards and James L. Southworth, {{working at}} the United States Marine Hospital at Stapleton, on Staten Island in New York, {{developed}} the technique of continuous caudal anesthesia. Hingson and Southworth first used this technique in an operation to remove the varicose veins of a Scottish merchant seaman. Rather than removing the caudal needle after the injection as was customary, the two surgeons experimented with a continuous caudal infusion of local anesthetic. Hingson then collaborated with Edwards, the chief obstetrician at the Marine Hospital, to study the use of continuous <b>caudal</b> anesthesia for <b>analgesia</b> during childbirth. Hingson and Edwards studied the caudal region to determine where a needle could be placed to deliver anesthetic agents safely to the spinal nerves without injecting them into the cerebrospinal fluid.|$|R
40|$|Background. <b>Caudal</b> <b>analgesia</b> {{is widely}} used in {{paediatric}} anaesthetic practice. In adults, the `whoosh ' test has been recommended {{as a guide to}} successful needle insertion, but it has not been extensively studied in paediatric patients. We have investigated a modi®cation of the `whoosh ' test, which we have christened the `swoosh ' test. It avoids the injection of air by per-forming auscultation during injection of the local anaesthetic solution. We have compared it with clinical judgement of correct placement. Methods. We studied 113 children undergoing elective surgery. During insertion of the caudal block, a stethoscope was placed over the lower lumbar spine and {{the presence or absence of}} an audible `swoosh ' noted. The operator's clinical impression of successful insertion was also recorded. Results. The overall success rate of caudal anaesthesia was 95. 6 %. Of the 108 patients with a successful block, 98 had a positive `swoosh ' test. There were no false positive results. Calculations show the `swoosh ' test to have a sensitivity of 91 %, a speci®city of 100 % and a positive predictive value of 100 %. Conclusions. The `swoosh ' test is a simple and accurate test to con®rm successful caudal insertion in children, and is especially useful as a teaching aid for anaesthetists new to the tech-nique...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess {{our study}} design and to obtain {{preliminary}} data for a dose-effect study on levobupivacaine for <b>caudal</b> <b>analgesia</b> in patients undergoing hypospadias repair. STUDY DESIGN: non randomised, non-blinded pilot study. METHOD: For this non-randomized, non-blinded pilot study, 20 patients (median age 17 months, median weight 10. 5 kg) were allocated to two groups receiving either 0. 5 mL kg(- 1) levobupivacaine 0. 125 % (Group 0) or 0. 5 mL kg(- 1) levobupivacaine 0. 375 % (Group 1) caudally after induction of anaesthesia for pain control. No further analgesia was given before, {{during or after}} the procedure. Pain scores (Children's and Infants' Postoperative Pain Scale) were recorded throughout the observation period, which lasted {{from the start of}} the procedure until hospital discharge on the following day. RESULTS: Group 0 : six out of 10 patients remained pain free throughout the observation period. Group 1 : six out of seven patients remained pain free throughout the observation period. CONCLUSION: Both concentrations of levobupivacaine provided excellent analgesia throughout surgery. The postoperative analgesia with both doses of levobupivacaine was found to be significantly longer lasting than previously reported. The study design, with a tight and extensive observation scheme, proved to be feasible, but given the surprisingly long-lasting analgesia, the observation period needs to be extended in future studies...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: <b>Caudal</b> <b>analgesia</b> {{is widely}} used in children; {{the aim of this}} trial was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of adding nalbuphine to local anesthetic in pediatric patients undergoing hernia repair. Patients and methods: This randomized double-blind controlled trial was done in department of anesthesia, Cairo University hospitals, and 40 patients with ASA physical status classification I–II, aged 2 – 7  years were enrolled in this study and randomly assigned into 2 groups; group L received caudal levobupivacaine 1  ml/kg with concentration of 0. 25 % and group LN received caudal 0. 125 % levobupivacaine with volume of 1  ml/kg plus 0. 2  mg/kg nalbuphine. Pain was evaluated immediately after emergence (FLACC 0  h), after 1  h in the PACU, after 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 12  h by the FLACC pain score (Face, Leg, Activity, Crying, Consolability). First time of rescue analgesic, total dose of rescue analgesic and side effects were observed for 12  h. Results: FLACC pain scores were much less in LN group compared to L group (p value    0. 001). The total dose of postoperative supplementary analgesia (intravenous paracetamol infusion) in the first 12  h was significantly lower in LN group (200. 5  ±  65. 5  mg) in comparison with L group (355. 25  ±  69. 9  mg) (P <  0. 05).

40|$|Objective:We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the intraoperative and postoperative analgesic effect and complications of caudal anaesthesia in 27 patients who underwent circumcision performed after induction of general anesthesia, in 2013 from January to May. Materials and methods: 27 cases of circumsicion who underwent caudal blocking following general anaesthesia between 2013 January-May were retrospectively investigated. Anaesthesic follow-up forms and nursing observation charts of patients were examined. Demographic data, anesthetic agent that is used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia, duration of surgery, type of local anesthetic {{as well as its}} type and concentration, intraoperative and postoperative analgesic requirements, time of administration and complications were recorded. Results: Mean age was 4. 9 +/- 2. 92 years of age ranging from 1 to 14 years and the average body weight was 19. 55 +/- 6. 51 kg. All patients were administered 0. 2 % bupivacaine (0. 8 ml/kg). Mean duration of surgery was 34. 62 +/- 4. 61 minutes. duration. No analgesics were used intraoperatively and mean duration of postoperative analgesia was recoreded as 20. 74 +/- 7. 25 hours. No complications were reported in the postoperative period. Conclusion:Caudal anaesthesia is an easily applied, safe and long-acting method in concordance with intraoperative and postoperative anaesthesia used in inguinal, urogenital and rectal pediatric surgery and it has an effective role in preventing complications.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} find out the effect of different analgesic drugs in sheep. A series of 30 analgesic trials (<b>caudal</b> epidural <b>analgesia)</b> were conducted in sheep with 2 % lignocaine hydrochloride (LH), 2 % lignocaine hydrochloride with adrenaline (LHA) and 0. 5 % bupivacaine hydrochloride (BH) in Veterinary Clinic, BAU, Mymensingh during January to April 2007. Analgesic injection was administered into low epidural space in 3 groups (A, B and C), each consisting of 10 apparently healthy sheep aged between 1 and 1. 5 years. Effects of analgesic drugs on heart rate, respiration rate and rectal temperature were monitored. Heart rates significantly decreased but respiration rates decreased nonsignificantly and rectal temperature non significantly increased during low epidural analgesia with 0. 5 % BH. Heart rates and respiration rates increased significantly when 2 % LH and 2 % LHA were used. LH (2 %) showed rapid spreading and was also free from any side effect. Duration of analgesia was prolonged with 2 % LH compared to other analgesic drugs. Peak point of analgesia was more with 2 % LHA as compare to other analgesic drugs.
