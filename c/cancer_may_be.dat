5|$|The vast {{majority}} (85%) {{of cases of}} lung cancer are due to long-term tobacco smoking. About 10–15% of cases occur in {{people who have never}} smoked. These cases are often caused by a combination of genetic factors and exposure to radon gas, asbestos, second-hand smoke, or other forms of air pollution. Lung <b>cancer</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> seen on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans. The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy which is usually performed by bronchoscopy or CT-guidance.|$|E
25|$|Cervical <b>cancer</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{prevented}} by pap smear screening and HPV vaccines. Vaginal cancer is very rare, and {{is primarily a}} matter of old age; its symptoms include abnormal vaginal bleeding or vaginal discharge.|$|E
25|$|Chemotherapy (drug {{treatment}} for <b>cancer)</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> used before surgery, after surgery, or instead of surgery for those {{cases in which}} surgery is considered unsuitable. Chemotherapy is justified for cancers whose prognosis after surgery is poor without additional intervention.|$|E

5|$|Endometrial <b>cancers</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> tumours {{derived from}} {{epithelial}} cells (carcinomas), mixed epithelial and mesenchymal tumours (carcinosarcomas), or mesenchymal tumours.|$|R
50|$|Early <b>cancers</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{associated}} with indigestion or a burning sensation (heartburn). However, less than 1 in every 50 people referred for endoscopy due to indigestion has cancer. Abdominal discomfort {{and loss of}} appetite, especially for meat, can occur.|$|R
25|$|Aa low {{testosterone}} level (hypogonadism) in men may {{be treated}} with testosterone administration. Prostate <b>cancer</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> treated by removing {{the major source of}} testosterone: testicle removal (orchiectomy); or agents which block androgens from accessing their receptor: anti-androgens.|$|E
25|$|The {{recommended}} {{treatment for}} renal cell <b>cancer</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> nephrectomy or partial nephrectomy, surgical removal of {{all or part}} of the kidney. This may include some of the surrounding organs or tissues or lymph nodes. If cancer is only in the kidneys, which is about 60% of cases, it can be cured roughly 90% of the time with surgery.|$|E
25|$|The {{early stages}} of {{cervical}} <b>cancer</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> completely free of symptoms. Vaginal bleeding, contact bleeding (one most common form being bleeding after sexual intercourse), or (rarely) a vaginal mass may indicate the presence of malignancy. Also, moderate pain during sexual intercourse and vaginal discharge are symptoms of cervical cancer. In advanced disease, metastases may {{be present in the}} abdomen, lungs, or elsewhere.|$|E
40|$|The {{epidemiology}} of anogenital cancers {{is under}} going substantial change. Cervical cancer remains {{a major public}} health concern, particular in resource-limited settings. Cancers of the anus, penis, vagina and vulva are relatively uncommon <b>cancers,</b> but <b>may</b> <b>be</b> increasing in incidence. The change in occurrence of anogenital <b>cancers</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> due to increasing HPV transmission secondary to changes in sexual behaviour. Screening programmes and the HPV vaccine offer optimism that anogenital cancers can be prevented. This article reviews the epidemiology of anogenital cancers {{with a focus on}} Scottish data...|$|R
50|$|In a human {{epidemiological}} analysis by Richard Doll and Richard Peto in 1981, diet {{was estimated to}} cause {{a large percentage of}} cancers. Studies suggest that around 32% of <b>cancer</b> deaths <b>may</b> <b>be</b> avoidable by changes to the diet. Some of these <b>cancers</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> caused by carcinogens in food generated during the cooking process, although {{it is often difficult to}} identify the specific components in diet that serve to increase cancer risk. Many foods, such as beef steak and broccoli, contain low concentrations of both carcinogens and anticarcinogens.|$|R
25|$|Metastatic <b>cancers</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{found at}} the same time as the primary tumor, or months or years later. When a second tumor is found in a patient that has been treated for cancer in the past, it is more often a {{metastasis}} than another primary tumor.|$|R
25|$|Tamoxifen is a SERM. Even {{though it}} is an {{antagonist}} in breast tissue it acts as partial agonist on the endometrium and {{has been linked to}} endometrial cancer in some women. Therefore, endometrial changes, including cancer, are among tamoxifen's side effects. With time, risk of endometrial <b>cancer</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> doubled to quadrupled, which is a reason tamoxifen is typically only used for 5 years.|$|E
25|$|Other {{important}} 18th- {{and early}} 19th-century surgeons included Percival Pott (1713–1788) who described tuberculosis on the spine and first demonstrated that a <b>cancer</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{caused by an}} environmental carcinogen (he noticed a connection between chimney sweep's exposure to soot and their high incidence of scrotal cancer). Astley Paston Cooper (1768–1841) first performed a successful ligation of the abdominal aorta, and James Syme (1799–1870) pioneered the Symes Amputation for the ankle joint and successfully carried out the first hip disarticulation.|$|E
25|$|Approximately {{one-third of}} men who choose active {{surveillance}} for early stage tumors eventually have signs of tumor progression, and they may need to begin treatment within three years. Men that choose active surveillance avoid the risks of surgery, radiation, and other treatments. The risk of disease progression and metastasis (spread of the <b>cancer)</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> increased, but this increase risk appears to be small if the program of surveillance is followed closely, generally including serial PSA assessments and repeat prostate biopsies every 1–2 years depending on the PSA trends.|$|E
50|$|Because many <b>cancers</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{driven by}} errors in {{chromosome}} segregation, {{it is hoped}} that Cheeseman’s studies will provide payoffs in cancer research. Certain cancer drugs target the connection between chromosomes and spindle microtubules, and some of the major proteins in the kinetochore complex have been implicated in leukemia and other diseases.|$|R

25|$|Early {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of ovarian <b>cancer</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> absent or subtle. In most cases, symptoms exist for several months before being recognized and diagnosed. Symptoms can be misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome. The early stages of ovarian cancer tend to be painless. Symptoms can vary based on the subtype. Low malignant potential (LMP) tumors, also known as borderline tumors, do not cause an increase in CA125 levels and are not identifiable with an ultrasound. The typical symptoms of an LMP tumor can include abdominal distension or pelvic pain. Particularly large masses tend to be benign or borderline.|$|E
25|$|Bowel <b>cancer</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{diagnosed}} by {{obtaining a}} sample of the colon during a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. This is then followed by medical imaging to determine if the disease has spread. Screening is effective for preventing and decreasing deaths from colorectal cancer. Screening, by {{one of a number of}} methods, is recommended starting from the age of 50 to 75. During colonoscopy, small polyps may be removed if found. If a large polyp or tumor is found, a biopsy may be performed to check if it is cancerous. Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs decrease the risk. Their general use is not recommended for this purpose, however, due to side effects.|$|E
25|$|Dysregulation of IGFBP-3 {{has been}} implicated in many cancers. IGFBP-3 is {{sometimes}} referred to as a tumor suppressor, and downregulation of its tissue expression by promoter hypermethylation in some cancers, such as hepatoma. and non-small cell lung <b>cancer</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> associated with poor patient outcome. However, consistent with the dual inhibitory and stimulatory roles of IGFBP-3 seen in cell culture, there are other cancer types, such as breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and clear cell renal cell cancer in which high tissue IGFBP-3 expression has been linked to poor prognostic features or patient outcome. The mechanisms regulating these contrasting effects of IGFBP-3 in vivo are not well understood.|$|E
30|$|Taken {{together}} {{it appears}} now well established that prolactin is indeed involved in generation {{and promotion of}} breast cancer. This makes it highly likely that such <b>cancers</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> prevented and their progression slowed down by dopamine agonists. Particularly VAC extracts with their low side effects seem favorable {{for the prevention of}} breast cancer by reducing mastodynia and fibrocystic mastopathy.|$|R
2500|$|... {{no current}} infections or recent cancer. Some patients, {{on a case}} by case basis, with lung cancer or other <b>cancers,</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> allowed. There are also certain cases where {{pre-existing}} infection is unavoidable, as with many patients with cystic fibrosis. In such cases, transplant centers, at their own discretion, [...] may accept or reject patients with current infections of B. cepacia or MRSA; ...|$|R
50|$|Definitive staging {{can only}} be done after surgery has been {{performed}} and pathology reports reviewed. An exception to this principle would be after a colonoscopic polypectomy of a malignant pedunculated polyp with minimal invasion. Preoperative staging of rectal <b>cancers</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> done with endoscopic ultrasound. Adjunct staging of metastasis include Abdominal Ultrasound, MRI, CT, PET Scanning, and other imaging studies.|$|R
25|$|An {{important}} anatomic {{landmark in}} anal {{cancer is the}} pectinate line (dentate line), which is located about 1–2cm from the anal verge (where the anal mucosa of the anal canal becomes skin). Anal cancers located above this line (towards the head) {{are more likely to}} be carcinomas, whilst those located below (towards the feet) {{are more likely to be}} squamous cell carcinomas that may ulcerate. Anal cancer is strongly associated with ulcerative colitis and the sexually transmissible infections HPV and HIV. Anal <b>cancer</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> a cause of constipation or tenesmus, or may be felt as a palpable mass, although it may occasionally present as an ulcerative form.|$|E
25|$|Genetic {{disorders}} may be hereditary, {{passed down}} from the parents' genes. In other genetic disorders, defects {{may be caused by}} new mutations or changes to the DNA. In such cases, the defect will only be passed down if it occurs in the germ line. The same disease, such as some forms of <b>cancer,</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> caused by an inherited genetic condition in some people, by new mutations in other people, and mainly by environmental causes in other people. Whether, when and to what extent a person with the genetic defect or abnormality will actually suffer from the disease is almost always affected by the environmental factors and events in the person's development.|$|E
25|$|A 2014 {{retrospective}} {{longitudinal study}} showed that firefighters are at higher risk for certain types of cancer. Firefighters had mesothelioma, which is caused by asbestos exposure, at {{twice the rate of}} the non-firefighting working population. Younger firefighters (under age 65) also developed bladder cancer and prostate cancer at higher rates than the general population. The risk of bladder <b>cancer</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> present in female firefighters, but research is inconclusive as of 2014. Preliminary research from 2015 on a large cohort of US firefighters showed a direct relationship between the number of hours spent fighting fires and lung cancer and leukemia mortality in firefighters. This link is a topic of continuing research in the medical community, as is cancer mortality in general among firefighters.|$|E
40|$|Previous studies {{reported}} inherited BRCA 1 / 2 deficits appear to cause cancer by impairing normal protective responses to some carcinogens. Opportunistic carcinogens can exploit these deficits by causing chronic inflammation, constant cell death and replacement in a mutagenic environment, DNA crosslinking or double strand breaks. Some {{of the resulting}} <b>cancers</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> prevented if BRCA 1 / 2 specific carcinogens are identified. |$|R
50|$|The {{activity}} of this kinase is increased in many <b>cancers</b> and <b>may</b> <b>be</b> a valid target for anti-cancer treatment.|$|R
25|$|<b>Cancer</b> risk <b>may</b> <b>be</b> increased, {{particularly}} myeloma. This {{is thought}} to be due to accumulation of glucosylceramide and complex glycosphingolipids.|$|R
25|$|Several key discoveries and {{understandings}} {{were required}} to treat the problem, which would take decades to work out, and even now is not 'solved'. Doctors speak of {{the natural history of}} diseases as a way to understand how therapy alters the usual progression of a disease. For example, the natural history of breast <b>cancer</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> measured in months but treated with surgery or chemotherapy the disease can be measured in years or even cured. Sudden cardiac arrest is a disease with an extremely rapid natural history, measured in minutes, with an inexorable outcome. But when treated with CPR the course of death can be extended (CPR will delay the dying process) and if treated with timely defibrillation death can be aborted.|$|E
25|$|As of 2012, {{prostate}} {{cancer is the}} second most frequently diagnosed cancer (at 15% of all male cancers) and the sixth leading cause of cancer death in males worldwide. In 2010 it resulted in 256,000 deaths up from 156,000 deaths in 1990. Rates of {{prostate cancer}} vary widely across the world. Although the rates vary widely between countries, it is least common in South and East Asia, and more common in Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand. Prostate cancer is least common among Asian men and most common among black men, with figures for white men in between. The average annual incidence rate of prostate cancer between 1988 and 1992 among Chinese men in the United States was 15 times higher than that of their counterparts living in Shanghai and Tianjin. However, these high rates may be affected by increasing rates of detection. Many suggest that prostate <b>cancer</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> under-reported, yet BPH incidence in China and Japan is similar to rates in Western countries. In Europe in 2012 it was the 3rd most diagnosed cancer after breast and colorectal at 417,000 cases.|$|E
500|$|In LEMS {{associated}} with lung cancer, most have no suggestive symptoms of cancer at the time, such as cough, coughing blood, and unintentional weight loss. [...] LEMS {{associated with}} lung <b>cancer</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> more severe.|$|E

5000|$|Salmonella typhi {{has been}} linked to {{gallbladder}} <b>cancer</b> but <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> useful in delivering chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of melanoma, colon and bladder cancer. [...] Bacteria found in the gut <b>may</b> <b>be</b> related to colon <b>cancer</b> but <b>may</b> <b>be</b> more complicated due to the role of chemoprotective probiotic cancers. [...] Microorganisms and their metabolic byproducts, or impact of chronic inflammation, <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> linked to oral cancers.|$|R
50|$|Fallopian tube cancer, which {{typically}} {{arises from the}} epithelial lining of the Fallopian tube, has historically been {{considered to be a}} very rare malignancy. Recent evidence suggests it probably represents a significant portion of what has been classified as ovarian cancer in the past. While tubal <b>cancers</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> misdiagnosed as ovarian cancer, it is of little consequence as the treatment of both ovarian and Fallopian tube cancer is similar.|$|R
