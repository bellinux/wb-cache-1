25|$|The first diode lasers were {{homojunction}} diodes. That is, {{the material}} (and thus the bandgap) of the waveguide <b>core</b> <b>layer</b> {{and that of}} the surrounding clad layers, were identical. It was recognized that there was an opportunity, particularly afforded by the use of liquid phase epitaxy using aluminum gallium arsenide, to introduce heterojunctions. Heterostructures consist of layers of semiconductor crystal having varying bandgap and refractive index. Heterojunctions (formed from heterostructures) had been recognized by Herbert Kroemer, while working at RCA Laboratories in the mid-1950s, as having unique advantages for several types of electronic and optoelectronic devices including diode lasers. LPE afforded the technology of making heterojunction diode lasers.|$|E

40|$|AbstractShock tube {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} study the dynamic response of sandwich panels with E-Glass Vinyl Ester (EVE) composite face sheets and stepwise graded styrene foam cores. Two types of core configurations, with identical areal density, were subjected to the shock wave loading. The <b>core</b> <b>layers</b> were arranged according to {{the density of the}} respective foam; configuration 1 consisted of low/middle/high density foams and configuration 2 consisted of middle/low/high density foams. The method to calculate the incident and reflected energies of the shock wave, as well as the deformation energy of the specimen, were proposed based on the shock wave pressure profiles and the high speed deflection images that were obtained. The experimental results showed that configuration 1 outperformed configuration 2 in regards to their blast resistance. Significant core material compression was observed in configuration 1, while in configuration 2 the <b>core</b> <b>layers</b> disintegrated and the front skin (blast side) fractured into two pieces along the midsection. The estimated energies were then calculated for both configurations.

50|$|The MF {{architecture}} {{is divided into}} the Control layer, <b>Core</b> <b>Layer</b> and the Platform layer. The <b>core</b> <b>layer</b> encapsulates most of the functionality of Media Foundation. It consists of the media foundation pipeline, which has three components: Media Source, Media Sink and Media Foundation Transforms (MFT). A media source is an object that acts {{as the source of}} multimedia data, either compressed or uncompressed. It can encapsulate various data sources, like a file, or a network server or even a camcorder, with source specific functionality abstracted by a common interface. A source object can use a source resolver object which creates a media source from an URI, file or bytestream. Support for non-standard protocols can be added by creating a source resolver for them. A source object can also use a sequencer object to use a sequence of sources (a playlist) or to coalesce multiple sources into single logical source. A media sink is the recipient of processed multimedia data. A media sink can either be a renderer sink, which renders the content on an output device, or an archive sink, which saves the content onto a persistent storage system such as a file. A renderer sink takes uncompressed data as input whereas an archive sink can take either compressed or uncompressed data, depending on the output type. The data from media sources to sinks are acted upon by MFTs; MFTs are certain functions which transform the data into another form. MFTs can include multiplexers and demultiplexers, codecs or DSP effects like reverb. The <b>core</b> <b>layer</b> uses services like file access and networking and clock synchronization to time the multimedia rendering. These are part of the Platform layer, which provides services necessary for accessing the source and sink byte streams, presentation clocks and an object model that lets the <b>core</b> <b>layer</b> components function asynchronously, and is generally implemented as OS services. Pausing, stopping, fast forward, reverse or time-compression can be achieved by controlling the presentation clock.|$|E
