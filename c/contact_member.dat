40|$|A {{system for}} {{capturing}} and docking an active craft to a passive craft has a first docking assembly on the active craft with a first <b>contact</b> <b>member</b> and a spike projecting outwardly, a second docking assembly on the passive craft {{having a second}} <b>contact</b> <b>member</b> and a flexible net deployed over a target area with an open mesh for capturing {{the end of the}} spike of the active craft, and a motorized net drive for reeling in the net and active craft to mate with the passive craft's docking assembly. The spike has extendable tabs to allow it to become engaged with the net. The net's center is coupled to a net spool for reeling in. An alignment funnel has inclined walls to guide the net and captured spike towards the net spool. The passive craft's docking assembly includes circumferentially spaced preload wedges which are driven to lock the wedges against the <b>contact</b> <b>member</b> of the active craft. The active craft's docking assembly includes a rotary table and drive for rotating it to a predetermined angular alignment position, and mating connectors are then engaged with each other. The system may be used for docking spacecraft in zero or low-gravity environments, as well as for docking underwater vehicles, docking of ancillary craft to a mother craft in subsonic flight, in-flight refueling systems, etc...|$|E

40|$|This bachelor‘s thesis {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of a module of laboratory device for measuring coefficient of friction and friction forces in elastohydrodynamic lubricated contacts. The module is able to measure friction forces in two perpendicular axes. A motivation for realization of this module was {{the absence of a}} similar equipment. The retrieval section of this thesis is dedicated to tribology, strain gauges (force sensors) and compliant mechanisms. The selection of the appropriate concept of the module and the force transducers is solved in the design part of thesis. The compliant mechanism with flexure hinges was designed via FEM analysis. This mechanism allows the displacement of the <b>contact</b> <b>member</b> of module {{in the direction of the}} frictional forces acting within a lubricated contact. The proposed module was manufactured, implemented in laboratory equipment and its functionality was tested. According to preliminary results, the module fulfilled the objectives of this thesis...|$|E

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{the performance}} of masonry walls enclosed by frame structures is studied and a new finite element model for these systems is presented. As part of this effort, the common modeling approaches i. e. micro-models and macro-models are briefly reviewed and their specifications are compared. Based on the findings in these comparisons, it was shown that macro modeling is the preferred modeling approach {{and the development of}} the new model is presented. The proposed model is described in detail and the calibration procedures along with the material models, used in the proposed model, are presented. To account for the interaction of the frame and the shear wall a <b>contact</b> <b>member</b> is developed. In support of this development three of most common solutions for contact problems that can be also used in modeling the frame-infill interaction problem are described; a detailed description for the chosen method along with a simple structural example is given. A method for capturing the behaviors of the steel reinforcement (if present) is presented for the case where the infill shear walls are reinforced. The proposed element was examined to see if it passes a patch test. Finally, a number of experimental tests conducted by other researchers are modeled using the proposed model and the results are compared with the behavior predicted by the model. Good agreement between the predicted and measured behavior was achieved...|$|E

50|$|The Armenian lobby {{has been}} subdued by the Turkish and Azerbaijani lobbies. In {{contrast}} to the Armenian lobby, the Turkish lobby mostly runs through its government. A study on ethnic lobbies and their effect on U.S. foreign policy indicated that the Turkish embassy is more active than Turkish-American organizations in attempting to influence U.S. regional foreign policy. Because the Republic of Turkey cannot legally finance campaigns, it relies on contracting Washington lobbying firms and <b>contacting</b> <b>members</b> of congress and their staff. In 2008, the Turkish government spent $3,524,632 on Washington lobbying activities and <b>contacted</b> <b>members</b> of Congress 2,268 times.
