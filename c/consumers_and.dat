40|$|Abstract Objective To {{collaborate}} with <b>consumer</b> <b>and</b> community {{representatives in the}} Alcohol and Pregnancy Project from 2006 - 2008 [URL] and evaluate researchers' <b>and</b> <b>consumer</b> <b>and</b> community representatives' perceptions of the process, context <b>and</b> impact of <b>consumer</b> <b>and</b> community participation in the project. Methods We formed two reference groups <b>and</b> sought <b>consumer</b> <b>and</b> community representatives' perspectives on {{all aspects of the}} project over a three year period. We developed an evaluation framework <b>and</b> asked <b>consumer</b> <b>and</b> community representatives and researchers to complete a self-administered questionnaire {{at the end of the}} project. Results Fifteen researchers (93. 8 %) and seven (53. 8 %) <b>consumer</b> <b>and</b> community representatives completed a questionnaire. Most <b>consumer</b> <b>and</b> community representatives agreed that the process and context measures of their participation had been achieved. Both researchers <b>and</b> <b>consumer</b> <b>and</b> community representatives identified areas for improvement and offered suggestions how these could be improved for future research. Researchers thought <b>consumer</b> <b>and</b> community participation contributed to project outputs and outcomes by enhancing scientific and ethical standards, providing legitimacy and authority, and increasing the project's credibility and participation. They saw it was fundamental to the research process <b>and</b> acknowledged <b>consumer</b> <b>and</b> community representatives for their excellent contribution. <b>Consumer</b> <b>and</b> community representatives were able to directly influence decisions about the research. They thought that <b>consumer</b> <b>and</b> community participation had significant influence on the success of project outputs <b>and</b> outcomes. Conclusions <b>Consumer</b> <b>and</b> community participation is an essential component of good research practice and contributed to the Alcohol and Pregnancy Project by enhancing research processes, outputs and outcomes, and this participation was valued by community <b>and</b> <b>consumer</b> representatives <b>and</b> researchers. The National Health and Medical Research Council in Australia expects researchers to work in partnership <b>and</b> involve <b>consumer</b> <b>and</b> community representatives in health and medical research, and to evaluate community <b>and</b> <b>consumer</b> participation.

5|$|After Harrison {{returned}} to the United States from Colombia, he settled on his farm in North Bend, Ohio, his adopted home state, living in relative retirement after nearly four decades of government service. Having accumulated no substantial wealth during his lifetime, he subsisted on his savings, a small pension, and the income produced by his farm. Harrison cultivated corn and established a distillery to produce whiskey. After a brief time in the liquor business, he became disturbed by the effects of alcohol on its <b>consumers,</b> <b>and</b> closed the distillery.

5|$|As {{ubiquitous}} insects, dipterans play {{an important}} role at various trophic levels both as <b>consumers</b> <b>and</b> as prey. In some groups the larvae complete their development without feeding, and in others the adults do not feed. The larvae can be herbivores, scavengers, decomposers, predators or parasites, with the consumption of decaying organic matter being one of the most prevalent feeding behaviours. The fruit or detritus is consumed along with the associated micro-organisms, a sieve-like filter in the pharynx being used to concentrate the particles, while flesh-eating larvae have mouth-hooks to help shred their food. The larvae of some groups feed on or in the living tissues of plants and fungi, and some of these are serious pests of agricultural crops. Some aquatic larvae consume the films of algae that form underwater on rocks and plants. Many of the parasitoid larvae grow inside and eventually kill other arthropods, while parasitic larvae may attack vertebrate hosts.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{regulation}} of interstate commerce, especially as concerned the railroads, was a political issue. The call for regulation of the railroads divided the nation's business interests, with railroads working against legislation and manufacturers, who were aggrieved by high railroad rates, joining the reformers. Standard Oil joined the latter group in calling for Congressional action. In 1886, Payne voted for {{a bill that would}} reform railroad rates slightly, but was considered ineffective by reformers. After amendments by the House, however, the bill returned to the Senate with more substantive prohibitions on the practices <b>consumers</b> <b>and</b> manufacturers found most egregious. Payne voted against the strengthened Interstate Commerce Act, which passed and was signed into law by President Grover Cleveland. In explaining his vote, Payne said that the law was impractical and unfairly advantaged other methods of shipping (such as boat transportation on the Great Lakes) over the railroads.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s Credit Suisse began {{catering}} to <b>consumers</b> <b>and</b> the middle-class with deposit counters, currency exchanges and savings accounts. The first branch outside of Zürich was opened in 1905 in Basel. The bank helped companies affected by World War I restructuring, and extended loans for reconstruction efforts. During the 1920s depression, net profits and dividends were halved and employees took salary cuts. After World War II, {{a substantial portion}} of Credit Suisse's business was in foreign reconstruction efforts. Holocaust survivors had problems trying to retrieve assets from relatives that died in concentration camps without death certificates. This led to a class action lawsuit in 1996 that settled in 2000 for $1.25 billion. The Agreement on the Swiss Banks' Code of Conduct with Regard to the Exercise of Due Diligence was created in the 1970s, after a Credit Suisse branch in Chiasso was exposed for illegally funneling $900 million in Italian deposits to speculative investments.|$|E
5|$|New Labour {{accepted}} the economic efficiency of {{free markets and}} believed {{that they could be}} detached from capitalism to achieve the aims of socialism, while maintaining the efficiency of capitalism. Markets were also useful for giving power to <b>consumers</b> <b>and</b> allowing citizens {{to make their own decisions}} and act responsibly. New Labour embraced market economics because they believed they could be used for their social aims, as well as economic efficiency. The party did not believe that public ownership was efficient or desirable; ensuring that they were not seen to be ideologically pursuing centralised public ownership was important to the party. In government, the party relied on public-private partnerships and private finance initiatives to raise funds and mitigate fears of a 'tax and spend' policy or excessive borrowing.|$|E
5|$|Species are broadly {{categorized}} as autotrophs (or primary producers), heterotrophs (or <b>consumers),</b> <b>and</b> Detritivores (or decomposers). Autotrophs are organisms that {{produce their own}} food (production is greater than respiration) by photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. Heterotrophs are organisms that must feed on others for nourishment and energy (respiration exceeds production). Heterotrophs can be further sub-divided into different functional groups, including primary consumers (strict herbivores), secondary consumers (carnivorous predators that feed exclusively on herbivores), and tertiary consumers (predators that feed on a mix of herbivores and predators). Omnivores do not fit neatly into a functional category because they eat both plant and animal tissues. It {{has been suggested that}} omnivores have a greater functional influence as predators, because compared to herbivores, they are relatively inefficient at grazing.|$|E
