50|$|One plan {{to control}} the {{vibrations}} is to actively vary the tether current to counteract {{the growth of the}} vibrations. Electrodynamic tethers can be stabilized by reducing their current when it would feed the oscillations, and increasing it when it opposes oscillations. Simulations have demonstrated that this can <b>control</b> <b>tether</b> vibration. This approach requires sensors to measure tether vibrations, which can either be an inertial navigation system {{on one end of the}} tether, or satellite navigation systems mounted on the tether, transmitting their positions to a receiver on the end.|$|E
5000|$|This type of {{attitude}} <b>control</b> <b>tether</b> {{has a small}} mass on one end, and a satellite on the other. Tidal forces stretch the tether between the two masses. There are two ways of explaining tidal forces. In one, the upper end mass {{of the system is}} moving faster than orbital velocity for its altitude, so centrifugal force makes it want to move further away from the planet it is orbiting. At the same time, the lower end mass of the system is moving at less than orbital speed for its altitude, so it wants to move closer to the planet. The end result is that the tether is under constant tension and wants to hang in a vertical orientation. The other way to explain tidal force is that the top of a tall object weighs less than the bottom, so they are pulled by different amounts. The [...] "extra" [...] pull on the [...] "bottom" [...] of the object stretches it out. On Earth, these are small effects, but in space, nothing opposes them. Either way, the end result is that the tidal forces stabilize the satellite so that its long dimension points towards the planet it is orbiting. Simple satellites have often been stabilized this way; either with tethers, or with how the mass is distributed within the satellite.|$|E
40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that the requirement for Ca 2 +-dependent exocytosis in cell-membrane repair is to provide an adequate lowering of membrane tension to permit membrane resealing. We used laser tweezers to form membrane tethers and measured the force of those tethers to estimate the membrane tension of Swiss 3 T 3 fibroblasts after membrane disruption and during resealing. These measurements show that, for fibroblasts wounded in normal Ca 2 + Ringer's solution, the membrane tension decreased dramatically after the wounding and resealing coincided with a decrease of ∼ 60 % of <b>control</b> <b>tether</b> force values. However, the tension did not decrease if cells were wounded in a low Ca 2 + Ringer's solution that inhibited both membrane resealing and exocytosis. When cells were wounded twice in normal Ca 2 + Ringer's solution, decreases in tension at the second wound were 2. 3 times faster than at the first wound, correlating well with twofold faster resealing rates for repeated wounds. The facilitated resealing to a second wound requires a new vesicle pool, which is generated via a protein kinase C (PKC) -dependent and brefeldin A (BFA) -sensitive process. Tension decrease at the second wound was slowed or inhibited by PKC inhibitor or BFA. Lowering membrane tension by cytochalasin D treatment could substitute for exocytosis and could restore membrane resealing in low Ca 2 + Ringer's solution...|$|E

40|$|Carbohydrates are {{the most}} {{abundant}} biomolecules found in living organisms. In addition to their roles such as fuel storage and structural components, carbohydrates encode molecular recognition information. Carbohydrates presented on the cell surface interact with cell surface receptors. These carbohydrate-receptor interactions {{are involved in a}} variety of biological processes including intercellular adhesion, microbial attachment, and signal transduction. Research in the DeShong laboratory has been focused on the development of cellular probes and targeted delivery vehicles utilizing carbohydrate-cell surface receptor interactions. The work reported herein details (1) the synthesis of glycoconjugates to functionalize the surface of gold, silica, nanoparticles, and surfactant vesicles, and (2) the preparation and characterization of carbohydrate-functionalized gold nanospheres and surfactant vesicles. A variety of N-linked glycoconjugates tethered to thiols, siloxanes, and hydrocarbons were synthesized via modified Staudinger methodology with a high stereoselectivity. The stereochemistry at the anomeric center (alpha vs. beta) was readily controlled by choosing the appropriate reaction conditions. Typically, the alpha-stereochemistry arose from the reaction of ester derivatives with isoxazolines generated in-situ via epimerization of beta-phosphorimines at high temperature. The ability to <b>control</b> <b>tether</b> length has been demonstrated. Carbohydrate-functionalized gold nanospheres were prepared by two methods: (1) in-situ reduction of gold salt in the presence of thiolated glycoconjugates to provide ca. 2 nm particles and (2) a stepwise method where thiolated glycoconjugates were self-assembled on the surface of pre-formed, citrate-capped gold nanospheres to provide nanospheres with larger diameters (15 - 73 nm). Carbohydrate-functionalized surfactant vesicles were prepared by mixing a cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium tosylate (CTAT) and an anionic surfactant sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) in the presence of lipidated glycoconjugates. The resulting surfactant vesicles were stable, in mean diameter of ca. 140 nm, and showed significant amounts of glycoconjugate incorporation. The bioactivity of carbohydrates on the surface of gold nanospheres and surfactant vesicles was investigated through agglutination assays using carbohydrate-binding lectins concanavalin A and peanut agglutinin. These agglutination results indicated that both gold nanospheres and surfactant vesicles display multiple presentations of carbohydrates on their surfaces {{that can be used for}} binding of receptors.

40|$|This paper proposes utilising the {{distributed}} Lorentz {{forces that}} are induced in an electromagnetic <b>tether</b> as a <b>control</b> actuator for <b>controlling</b> the <b>tether</b> motion. The <b>control</b> input governing {{the magnitude of the}} applied actuator force is the current being conducted within the tether. A wave-absorping controller is also proposed to suppress the unstable high order modes that tend to be initiated by electromagnetic forces. The absorption of travelling waves along the tether may be achieved by proper movement of the tether attachment point on the main satellite. A mission function control law is presented for <b>controlling</b> the <b>tether</b> length and in- and out-of-plane librations, derived from a model that treats the tether as an inextensible rigid rod.

40|$|Early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA 1) is a cytosolic {{protein that}} {{specifically}} binds to early endosomal membranes {{where it has}} {{a crucial role in}} the tethering process leading to homotypic endosome fusion. Green fluorescent protein-tagged EEA 1 (EEA 1 -GFP) was bound to the endosomal membrane throughout the cell cycle, and measurements using fluorescent recovery after photobleaching showed two fractions: one rapidly exchanging with the cytosolic pool, and the other with a long half-life. The exchange consists of a release and binding process, and we have separated these two by using GFP and photoactivable GFP. The release rate was identical to the exchange rate, showing that the dissociation characteristics determine the cycling of this molecule. During mitosis, we found that the dissociation rate was markedly accelerated and, in addition, the long-lived fraction was markedly reduced. This indicates that a fusion arrest in mitosis is not the result of EEA 1 not binding to early endosomes, but rather due to the marked shift in membrane-binding characteristics.

40|$|An {{approach}} to <b>control</b> <b>tethered</b> wings for airborne wind energy is proposed. A fixed {{length of the}} lines is considered, and {{the aim of the}} control system is to obtain figure-eight crosswind trajectories. The proposed technique is based on the notion of the wing's "velocity angle" and, in contrast with most existing approaches, it does not require a measurement of the wind speed or of the effective wind at the wing's location. Moreover, the proposed approach features few parameters, whose effects on the system's behavior are very intuitive, hence simplifying tuning procedures. A simplified model of the steering dynamics of the wing is derived from first-principle laws, compared with experimental data and used for the control design. The control algorithm is divided into a low-level loop for the velocity angle and a high-level guidance strategy to achieve the desired flight patterns. The robustness of the inner loop is verified analytically, and the overall control system is tested experimentally on a small-scale prototype, with varying wind conditions and using different wings.

One use for which tethers are particularly well suited {{is to provide}} an isolated platform for spaceborne observatories. The advantages of tethering a pointing platform 1 or 2 km from a space shuttle or space station are that, compared to placing the observatory on the parent spacecraft, vibrational disturbances are attenuated and contamination is eliminated.
