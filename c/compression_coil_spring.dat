50|$|On the {{right-hand}} edge is a long, curved steel blade, {{often referred to}} as a knife, attached to the base at one corner. Larger versions have a strong <b>compression</b> <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> as part of the attachment mechanism that pulls the knife against the stationary edge as the knife is drawn down to cut the paper. The other end of the knife unit is a handle. The stationary right edge of the base is also steel, with an exposed, finely-ground edge. When the knife is pulled down to cut paper, the action resembles that of a pair of scissors, only instead of two knives moving against each other, one is stationary. The combination of a blade mounted to a steady base produces clean and straight cuts, the likes of which would have otherwise required a ruler and razor blade to achieve on a single page. Paper cutters are also used for cutting thin sheet metal, cardboard, and plastic. The blade on a paper cutter is made of steel which makes it almost impossible to break.|$|E

When the actuator is driven, the bellow extends, and the spring is compressed. Consequently, the spring constant of the actuator is calculated by summing those of the bellow and the spring.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: An access device using a {{combination}} of a <b>compression</b> <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> made of NiTi shape memory alloy (SMA) and NiTi superelastic strips has been developed. Particular consideration is given to the application of the concept in tran-sanal endocopic microsurgery (TEM), but it could be used in other procedures where tissue expansion is required. In TEM, it could realize the gasless dilation of the rectum with safety and reliability, and facilitate surgeons to perform TEM. The theoretical design procedure to determine the specifications of the NiTi SMA spring and superelastic compo-nents is established. The feasibility and the possible problems associated with this application are discussed generally...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{analyzed}} why a <b>compression</b> <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> fractured at {{the transition}} position from the bearing coil {{to the first}} active coil in service, while the nominal stress here should always be much less than that at the inside coil position of a fully active coil. Visual observations indicated that a wear scar was formed on the first active coil and the fracture surface showed radiating ridges emanating from the wear scar. Scanning electron microscopy examination showed crescent shaped region and beach marks, typical of fatigue failure. ZnCaph phosphate layer and painting around the contact zone were worn out due to contact and friction and resulted in corrosion and corrosion pits induced local stress concentration. Stress analysis indicated severe stress singularities {{at the edges of}} the contact zone, which facilitated cycle slip and fatigue crack nucleation. Recommendations were also made for improving the fatigue performance of the suspension springs...|$|E

5000|$|A cush {{drive is}} a part of a {{motorcycle}} or scooter drive-train that is designed to reduce stress from engine torque damaging other components during gear or throttle changes. A common design used by almost all street motorcycles, it has three major pieces: the wheel, the sprocket assembly, and the rubber damper. The wheel and the sprocket assembly fit together with five or more sections much like two hands woven together. In between the contact of the two assembly are rubber blocks. This makes it so the wheel and the sprocket have a dampening layer between them, and the rubber blocks reduce wear and fatigue of the metal assemblies. Another popular system incorporates metallic <b>compression</b> type <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> placed between the input and output shafts of the cush drive assembly.|$|R

Aims and objectives : The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the effect of wire diameter, lumen size and length of <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> on the load produced as a function of displacement of SS and NiTi <b>coil</b> <b>spring.</b> Materials and methods : The study consisted of 60 samples of open and closed <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> (30 each). Open <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> were tested in <b>compression</b> and closed <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> in tension using a Lloyd universal testing machine. The data obtained was subjected to statistical analysis using student′s t-test. Results : Mean values, standard deviation and t-value were calculated. Statistically significant difference were obtained in between the groups (p < 0. 05), (p < 0. 001). Discussion : The heaviest load value at 60 % compression was recorded in 0. 010 × 0. 030 spring with 20 cm initial length due to its large wire diameter and reduced lumen size among the <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> tested. Straight line of load deflection curve bears clinical significance due to unpredictable behavior of spring beyond a certain limit. Permanent deformation exhibited by SS <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> is due to high stiffness is low spring fact. Conclusion : Coil linear load delivered by SS open <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> on <b>compression</b> changes the original length from 33 to 50 % which depends on wire diameter and lumen size of <b>coil</b> <b>spring...</b>|$|R

40|$|A first {{end surface}} of a <b>coiled</b> <b>compression</b> <b>spring</b> at its relaxed length is {{machined}} to a plane transverse to the spring axis. The spring is then placed in a press structure having first and second opposed planar support surfaces, with the machined spring end surface bearing against the first support surface, the unmachined spring end surface bearing against a planar first {{surface of a}} lateral force compensation member, and an opposite, generally spherically curved surface of the compensation member bearing against the second press structure support surface. The spring is then compressed generally to its loaded length, and a circumferentially spaced series of marks, lying in a plane parallel to the second press structure support surface, are formed on the <b>spring</b> <b>coil</b> on which the second spring end surface lies. The spring is then removed from the press structure, and the second spring end surface is machined to the mark plane.
