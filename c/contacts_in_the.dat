5|$|During Taraki's foreign {{visit to}} the non-aligned conference in Cuba, his Gang of Four had {{received}} an intelligence report that Amin was planning to arrest or kill them. This report, it turned out, was incorrect. Nonetheless, the Gang of Four were ordered to assassinate Amin, its leader Sarwari selecting his nephew Aziz Akbari to conduct the assassination. However, Akbari was not informed {{that he was the}} chosen assassin or that it was a secret mission, and he confided the information to <b>contacts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Soviet embassy. The embassy responded by warning Amin of the assassination attempt, thereby saving him from certain death.|$|E

5|$|Lord Granville died {{in early}} 1846, having never {{recovered}} from a stroke he suffered five years previously. He was buried at Stone, Staffordshire. His death desolated his wife. She lived henceforth in complete retirement, residing chiefly at Chiswick House, where she turned to piety for consolation. Her <b>contacts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> outside world were chiefly her children and step-children, her brother William, {{and the children of}} her sister Georgiana. She survived her husband by fifteen years, dying on 25 November 1862 of a stroke at her London home at 13 Hereford Street.|$|E
5|$|Flamethrower, {{double piston}} and gunpowder-activated: Although the single piston {{flamethrower}} was first {{developed in the}} Byzantine Empire during the 7th century, the 10th-century Chinese flamethrower, or Pen Huo Qi, boasted a continuous stream of flame by employing double piston syringes (which had been known since the Han Dynasty) spouting Greek fire which had been imported from China's maritime trade <b>contacts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Middle East. It was first used in battle 932 during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (907–960), and the earliest illustration {{is found in the}} early Song Dynasty military manuscript Wujing Zongyao of 1044, which also described the device in full. Unlike the Greek model which employed a furnace, the Pen Huo Qi was ignited by an incendiary gunpowder fuse.|$|E

5|$|Schindler {{was arrested}} twice on {{suspicion}} of black market activities and once for breaking the Nuremberg Laws by kissing a Jewish girl, an action forbidden by the Race and Resettlement Act. The first arrest, in late 1941, led to him being kept overnight. His secretary arranged for his release through Schindler's influential <b>contacts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Nazi Party. His second arrest, on 29 April 1942, {{was the result of}} his kissing a Jewish girl on the cheek at his birthday party at the factory the previous day. He remained in jail five days before his influential Nazi contacts were able to obtain his release. The third arrest, where he was accused of black marketeering and bribing Göth and others to improve the conditions of the Jewish workers, took place in October 1944. He was held for most of a week and released. Göth had been arrested on 13 September 1944 for corruption and other abuses of power, and Schindler's arrest was part of the ongoing investigation into Göth's activities. Göth was never convicted on those charges, but was hanged by the Supreme National Tribunal of Poland for war crimes on 13 September 1946.|$|E
5|$|The first popular {{rock music}} bootleg {{resulted}} from Bob Dylan's activities between largely disappearing {{from the public}} eye after his motorcycle accident in 1966, {{and the release of}} John Wesley Harding at the end of 1967. After a number of artists had hits with Dylan songs that he had not officially recorded and released himself, demand increased for these recordings, particularly when they started airing on local radio in Los Angeles. Through various <b>contacts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> radio industry, a number of pioneering bootleggers managed to buy a reel to reel tape containing a selection of unreleased Dylan songs intended for distribution for music publishers and wondered if {{it would be possible to}} manufacture them on an LP. They managed to convince a local pressing plant to press between 1,000 and 2,000 copies discreetly, paying in cash and avoiding using real names or addresses. Since the bootleggers could not commercially print a sleeve, due to it attracting too much attention from recording companies, the LP was issued in a plain white cover with Great White Wonder rubber stamped on it. Subsequently, Dylan became one of the most popular artists to be bootlegged with numerous releases.|$|E
