50|$|In their conclusions, {{the authors}} observe that this {{refusal of the}} Dutch to integrate, participate, and {{contribute}} to their new German community contrasts strongly with the current Dutch public opinion, political climate, or indeed legislation. The Dutch political climate, and the apparent support of Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, was recently discussed and condemned by the European Union. Dutch legislation, the Integration law for immigrants to the Netherlands Act obliges migrants entering the Netherlands to integrate into Dutch society. To measure this, migrants are subjected to courses and a final exam, determining the migrants’ ability to speak the Dutch language and general knowledge of Dutch society. Failure to pass the exam (e.g. inability to speak Dutch) results in expulsion. Participation in this exam is only required of non-EU nationals. Although public sentiments and opinions vary considerably, as for the whole EEC territory, the German <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> for non EU nationals {{are very similar to}} those in the Netherlands.|$|E

50|$|In 1923 the Parliament of the Union of South Africa {{passed the}} Natives (Urban Areas) Act (Act No. 21 of 1923). The {{purpose of the}} Act was to provide for {{improved}} <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> for natives in urban areas, to control their ingress into such areas and to restrict their access to intoxicating liquor. The Act required local authorities to provide accommodation for Natives (then the polite term for Africans or Blacks) lawfully employed and resident within the area of their jurisdiction. Pursuant to this Act the Johannesburg town council formed a Municipal Native Affairs Department in 1927. It bought 1 300 morgen of land on the farm Klipspruit No. 8 and the first houses in {{what was to become}} Orlando Location were built there {{in the latter half of}} 1930. The township was named after the chairman of the Native Affairs committee, Mr. Edwin Orlando Leake. In the end some 10,311 houses were built there by the municipality. In addition it built 4,045 temporary single-room shelters.In about 1934 James Sofasonke Mpanza moved to 957 Pheele Street, Orlando, and lived there for the rest of his life. A year after his arrival in Orlando he formed his own political party, the Sofasonke Party. He also became very active in the affairs of the Advisory Board for Orlando. Towards the end of World War II there was an acute shortage of housing for Blacks in Johannesburg. By the end of 1943 the Sofasonke Party advised its members to put up their own squatters' shacks on municipal property. On Saturday 25 March 1944 the squat began. Hundreds of homeless people from Orlando and elsewhere joined Mpanza in marching to a vacant lot in Orlando West and starting a squatters camp. The City Council's resistance crumbled. After feverish consultations with the relevant government department, it was agreed that an emergency camp, which could house 991 families, be erected. It was to be called Central Western Jabavu. The next wave of land invasions took place in September 1946. Some 30,000 squatters congregated west of Orlando. Early the next year the City Council proclaimed a new emergency camp. It was called Moroka. 10,000 sites were made available immediately. Moroka became Johannesburg's worst slum area. Residents erected their shanties on plots measuring six metres by six metres. There were only communal bucket-system toilets and very few taps. The camps were meant to be used for a maximum of five years, but when they were eventually demolished in 1955, Moroka and Jabavu housed 89,000 people.|$|E
50|$|In 1855 Grant {{was elected}} {{a member of}} the Victorian Legislative Council for Sandhurst, and when {{responsible}} government was established in 1856, was elected {{a member of the}} Legislative Assembly for Sandhurst Boroughs (based around current Bendigo). Grant did not stand at the 1859 Sandhurst Boroughs election, but, in October 1959, was elected for Avoca and held this seat until his death. Grant joined the Richard Heales ministry in February 1861 as vice-president of the board of land and works and commissioner of public works, and resigned with Heales in November. Grant was commissioner for railways in the James McCulloch ministry from June 1863 to September 1864 and then became president of the board of lands and works and commissioner of crown lands and survey from September 1864 to May 1868. In 1865 Grant succeeded in passing a land act which promised to be little more successful than previous acts, the conditions being too exacting for poor men. One clause, however, which had been meant to apply to goldfield areas, allowed selectors to take up 20 acre at a rental of two shillings an acre. Grant interpreted this very liberally and many applicants were allowed to hold four licences and thus farms of 80 acre were established. However, in May 1869, Grant brought in a new land bill which allowed the selection of up to 320 acre with <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence,</b> cultivation and improvement at a yearly payment of two shillings an acre, with liberal terms to convert into freehold. Grant was then holding the same position in the second McCulloch ministry as in the previous one, and went out of office in September 1869. The act, however, came into force on 1 February 1870 and, though amended by later governments, was the basis of all subsequent land settlement in Victoria. Grant earned great popularity from it, and was afterwards presented with a testimonial of £3000 raised by public subscription. He again held the lands portfolio in the Charles Duffy ministry from June 1871 to June 1872, was minister of justice in the first Graham Berry ministry for a few weeks in 1875, held the same position in the second Berry ministry from May 1877 to March 1880, and was chief secretary and minister of public instruction in the Bryan O'Loghlen ministry from July 1881 to March 1883. He was able to do valuable work at the education department by insisting on the importance of merit in considering promotions. Grant had a stroke of paralysis in November 1884 and died on 1 April 1885, leaving a widow, a son and three daughters. Grant was buried in Melbourne General Cemetery after a service at Elsternwick Presbyterian Church. A grant of £4000 was subsequently voted by parliament to his family.|$|E

40|$|Peculiarities of {{migration}} processes development in the Russian Federation indicate {{that along with}} the gradual normalization of the migration situation there is an actual problem of foreign nationals connected with their adaptation and integration.

In 2014, 43940 people arrived in Khabarovsk Krai; 131479 foreign citizens and persons without citizenship were registered in the migration office. As a result of changing climatic, socioeconomic, psychological-pedagogical conditions, foreign citizens, in most cases, show a low level of sociopsychological readiness to integrate into the local community in its actual borders.  The fact of changing the place of residence is a destabilizing factor and entails certain disadvantages: the change of the social environment, the climate, the legal field. Under the new <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> foreign citizens must adapt to the surrounding space - establish social relationships (friendship, business, relations with neighbors), study and know the laws of the community, receive (restore) the social and legal status (employment, realization of the right to education and training children, decent livelihood).

On the other hand legislation has always permitted ‘the making and recovery of charges [for health services]’ where ‘expressly provided for’ in the Act in question. Irregular migrants are ‘foreign nationals who do not comply with immigration law requirements. ’ They carry the more familiar label of ‘illegal immigrants’ in everyday parlance. That term is avoided here partly because of its (largely erroneous) associations with criminality, but primarily because of the stigmatising and dehumanising effects that such epithets bear on the individual concerned. For these reasons the more neutral term ‘irregular migrant’ is preferred by some authors and is used throughout this chapter.

To deepen the knowledge about contexts of occurrence of child malnutrition, we analyzed nutritional status in relation to socio-environmental <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> in children between three and six years from Villaguay, Entre Ríos, Argentina. We performed a cross-sectional study of 1, 435 school children of both sexes. Body weight and height were measured and prevalence of low height/age (LH/A), low weight/age (LW/A), low BMI/age (LBMI/A), overweight (Ow) and obesity (Ob) was calculated using World Health Organization reference charts. Socio-environmental information was obtained through a semi-structured survey and processed by Categorical Principal Component Analysis (CatPCA). Anthropometric data showed 1. 5 % LW/A, 5. 2 % LH/A; 0. 6 % LBMI/A, 20. 9 % Ow and 10. 9 % Ob. CatPCA allowed us to define four groups (G 1 -G 4) with better (G 2), middle (G 1) and worst (G 4) urban socio-environmental conditions and one with rural characteristics (G 3).

40|$|International audienceIn France in 2012, of {{the total}} {{population}} of 65. 2 million, 8. 7 % were migrants. After being the third principal host country, France is now the 6 th highest host country in the OECD. Since the 1980 's numerous Acts have been passed by parliament on immigration issues. In 2000 the Universal Health Cover (Couverture Maladie Universelle) was created as health coverage for all residents of France. At the same time the State Medical Assistance (Aide Médicale de l'Etat) was created as health protection for undocumented migrants. Since the creation of this scheme, it has been the object of many political debates which call it into question, on account of its cost, perceived fraud, and the legitimacy of a social protection for undocumented migrants. Recently, access to State Medical Assistance has been made difficult by introducing <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> and financial contributions. After a reports' analysis on institutional, associative, research studies and European recommendations, we note that all reports converge on the necessity of health protection for undocumented migrants. The major reasons are humanitarian, respect of European and International conventions, for public health, and financial. Moreover, fraud allegations have proved to be unfounded. Finally, State Medical Assistance is underused: In 2014 data from Médecins du Monde shows that only 10. 2 % of undocumented migrant patients in their health facilities have access to this scheme. We conclude that the political debate concerning the State Medical Assistance should be about its under-utilisation, its improvement, its merger with the Universal Health Cover, and not its elimination. Moreover, the current debates regarding this scheme stigmatize this population, which is already precarious, making it more difficult for migrants to access healthcare, and generally, weaken national social cohesion. © 2016 André and Azzedine...|$|E
40|$|Immigration in Europe {{has been}} shaped by: a) its {{particular}} development in time; b) the geographical patterns of migration within and towards European countries; and c) the shifting types of migration and characteristics of migrants involved. The {{first part of this}} contribution outlines changes in these three basic migration-related factors. Migration outcomes are not haphazard nor are these the result of unhindered economic push and pull factors in a free market. Immigration policies of receiving countries do greatly influence the volume and patterns of migration, the place of settlement and the characteristics of migrants. Regulations on <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> and integration do furthermore influence significantly the position of immigrants in their new destination, among others by setting conditions for their stay (residence rights) and access to the labour market. The second part of this chapter outlines the migration and integration regimes that have been developed by states of different parts of Europe and by the European Union. In conclusion, immigration has become a relevant phenomenon in all EU countries. However, as a consequence of different timing of immigration, different socio-economic contexts and varying governmental migration and integration policies, European countries are confronted with different forms migration (immigration, emigration, transit migration) and with different types of migrants. European states have also developed different governmental policies of migration and integration. Historically, a common denominator in the framing of European policies is that countries do not see themselves as immigration countries; they are immigration countries against their will. In recent times, such framing is reinforced by populist and nationalist movements that see immigrants not only as economic competitors, but also {{as a threat to the}} national "culture and world views".
