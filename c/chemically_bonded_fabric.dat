50|$|In case {{of water}} surface bursts, the {{particles}} {{tend to be}} rather lighter and smaller, producing less local fallout but extending over a greater area. The particles contain mostly sea salts with some water; these can have a cloud seeding effect causing local rainout and areas of high local fallout. Fallout from a seawater burst is difficult to remove once it has soaked into porous surfaces because the fission products are present as metallic ions that <b>chemically</b> <b>bond</b> to many surfaces. Water and detergent washing effectively removes less than 50% of this <b>chemically</b> <b>bonded</b> activity from concrete or steel.
