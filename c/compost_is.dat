After a few minutes, the top of the pyramid is removed repeatedly, until the worms are again visible. This repeats until the mound is composed mostly of worms.|$|E

40|$|This study {{applied the}} risk {{assessment}} methodology developed by USEPA for establishing regulatory contaminant limits and loading rates for municipal biosolids to MSW compost. Literature data on trace element and organics composition of MSW <b>compost</b> <b>were</b> evaluated relative to {{levels of the}} same compounds in biosolids. In addition, data from several laboratory, greenhouse, and field studies with MSW <b>compost</b> <b>were</b> used to determine parameter values for MSW compost for the 503 risk assessment algorithms. Assumptions about MSW compost production and use patterns were used to evaluate impacts on other algorithm parameters. Organics and trace elements in MSW <b>compost</b> <b>were</b> low in most cases, and only Pb exceeded the 503 exceptional quality (EQ) concentration limit. Trace organics concentrations in MSW <b>compost</b> <b>are</b> low compared to those in biosolids {{with the exception of}} phthalate esters. Degradation, leaching and plant uptake studies with selected organics added to MSW prior to composting showed that these materials degrade during composting and in soil, do not leach, and are taken up by crops at low but measurable levels. Concentrations of organics in MSW <b>compost</b> <b>are</b> low compared to the risk levels, and thus regulation is not warranted based on risk. Trace element bioavailability was similar or lower in MSW compost as in biosolids. Considering this and the likelihood that MSW <b>compost</b> will not <b>be</b> used extensively in general agriculture (primarily used by home gardeners or for specialty crops, and for horticultural applications), and that the supply of MSW <b>compost</b> will <b>be</b> no greater than that of biosolids, it appears that safe, risk-based trace element concentrations for MSW <b>compost</b> may <b>be</b> as high or higher than those for biosolids. Given that the actual concentrations of trace elements in MSW <b>composts</b> <b>are</b> no higher than those in biosolids (with the possible exception of Pb), regulatory limits on trace elements in MSW compost should not affect land application of these materials. A concentration standard for B, a phytotoxic trace element often found in much higher concentrations in MSW compost than in biosolids is recommended...|$|R

30|$|The major {{difference}} in the grass and maize <b>composts</b> <b>was</b> reflected in the 10 % straw mixtures. The peak ammonium concentration in the maize <b>composts</b> <b>was</b> significantly (P < 0.05) higher than its grass equivalent after 3 weeks of <b>composting.</b> This might <b>be</b> indicative of greater N losses through ammonia volatilization in the maize compost especially during the thermophilic phase of <b>composting.</b> It <b>is</b> also {{worth noting that the}} appearance of ammonium peaks in grass <b>composts</b> <b>was</b> delayed relative to those in the maize composts suggesting a slower rate of decomposition in the latter. Both compost types showed marked decreases in the nitrate concentration between days 97 and 140 especially for the 0 % and 10 % mixtures. This could be due to losses as a result of denitrification or leaching. Conditions leading to such losses could have been created when moisture was adjusted on day 97. There is therefore need for further investigation of alternative methods for adjusting compost moisture content.|$|R
