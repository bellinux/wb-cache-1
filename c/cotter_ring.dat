50|$|A circle cotter, {{also known}} as a <b>cotter</b> <b>ring</b> or split ring, is a formed wire {{fastener}} that is shaped like a circle, hence the name. The open end of the wire {{is in the middle of}} the cotter so when it is installed the inner tab is first installed in the hole. Because of this feature it is often used in applications where a sharp edge cannot be tolerated, such as fabric applications.|$|E
