After a long road trip and the challenges imposed {{by the lack of}} resources, already in a first moment, they could note the racial thematic was not in the main subjects of the event. As Sandra Bello tells, the <b>class</b> <b>question</b> was present in the meeting, because many feminists didn't accept the active participation of black women with a profile related to the suburban and to the favelas. Also, these women represented a rupture with the eurocentric feminist vision, through which white feminists [...] "defined the quotas of participation of black women in the Meetings".|$|E
5000|$|The party {{wants to}} reduce the number of private schools; Djupedal claims they are of no use. Bård Vegar Solhjell said he {{believed}} government-funded schools helped [...] "smoothing social inequality". He further stated, [...] "Many of those who remain outside the labor market have received lack of training from school. It prevents them from contributing to the community. Parties on the right often confuse social security and welfare schemes as the problem; however we tend to look at why they are struggling. There are systematic connections between social background and lack of training - it is a <b>class</b> <b>question</b> where something is needed to be done." [...] Others believe that the party should nationalise non-public schools. Torbjørn Urfjell, former leader of the Socialist Youth chapter in Vest-Agder, said [...] "School and adolescence is too important to be left to the market. Therefore, they should be taken back". During the 2005 election, the party promised to increase resources to public schools, believing that more money would lead to fewer pupils per teacher, and thus more individualised and personal instructions.|$|E
30|$|The most {{powerful}} {{of the factors that}} affect performance is the replacement of classes by collections. Markman (1973) used materials such as six dogs (four small, two big) and compared two questions: The <b>class</b> <b>question,</b> “Who would have more pets, someone who owned the baby dogs or someone who owned the dogs?” and the collection question in which the collection name replaced the final occurrence of the hypernym: “Who […..] who owned the family”. The author reports that more than 50  % of 7 -year-olds passed the collection question whereas none of them passed the <b>class</b> <b>question.</b> The study was motivated by the observation that it is permissible to designate the subclass by the hypernym, so that if the children are set to make subclass comparisons (for cognitive, linguistic or perceptive reasons), they may be encouraged to misinterpret the question, which cannot occur with collections as {{it is not possible to}} designate the subclass by the word “family”. Surprisingly, even though the ambiguity is well noted, its explanatory role is amalgamated with another factor: This is the notion that in a collection such as a family the subparts (parents and children) stand in a specific relation to one another, which could help apprehending the part and the whole simultaneously. This second explanation will be considered in detail and refuted later (“Experimental investigation of the role of collections” section).|$|E

We analyze 15 music genres and four clusters that represent different musical realms: highbrow, western popular, mixed popular and eastern-religious popular. We embed the status versus <b>class</b> <b>question</b> in the particular features of Israeli society by focusing on two issues. First, {{the extent to which}} cultural stratification is affected by parental social position. Second, the role played by ethnicity and religiosity in affecting cultural stratification. Three main conclusions are drawn. First, status plays a more important role than class in shaping musical tastes that represent the highbrow/lowbrow dimension in cultural consumption. Second, in Israel musical tastes are shaped by parental social position rather than respondents ’ social position. And third, both ethnicity and religiosity demarcate distinctions between highbrow and lowbrow tastes. The implications of these results for social stratification in Israel are discussed. # 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. 1...|$|E

40|$|We {{provide new}} {{characterizations}} of two previously studied questions on nondeterministic function classes: Q 1 : Do nondeterministic functions admit efficient deterministic refinements? Q 2 : Do nondeterministic function classes contain complete functions? We show that Q 1 {{for the class}} {{is equivalent to the}} question whether the standard proof system for SAT is p-optimal, and to the assumption that every optimal proof system is p-optimal. Assuming only the existence of a p-optimal proof system for SAT, we show that every set with an optimal proof system has a p-optimal proof system. Under the latter assumption, we also obtain a positive answer to Q 2 for the class. An alternative view on nondeterministic functions is provided by disjoint sets and tuples. We pursue this approach for disjoint -pairs and its generalizations to tuples of sets from and with disjointness conditions of varying strength. In this way, we obtain new characterizations of Q 2 for the <b>class.</b> <b>Question</b> Q 1 for is equivalent {{to the question of whether}} every disjoint -pair is easy to separate. In addition, we characterize this problem by the question of whether every propositional proof system has the effective interpolation property.

40|$|The aim of {{this essay}} is to get deeper into the mysteries of love as they {{manifest}} themselves as most open: in literature. I have studied the two French writers Claire Etcherelli and Françoise Sagan, both writing about love in the 50 ’s Paris. While Etcherelli’s love takes place between factory workers, Sagan’s scene is the upper middle class. My question is how love manifests itself in such similar but yet different surroundings: is love a <b>class</b> <b>question?</b> Looking at the structure present in the novels and how the love story proceeds, I have discovered that although the conditions are fundamentally different, the structure is almost identical. This is itself an ideological fact. The structure shows that in both cases, love appears {{as a solution to}} an unsatisfactory situation. The man enters the novel when the heroine knows she needs change. With him, she then embarks on a project for change. This project implies for Sagan a journey towards nature and the dissolution of the Self, whereas for Etcherelli it means a greater involvement in the political struggle and the constitution of an identity. The journeys undertaken are therefore diametrically opposed, yet the way they are taken about, is the same. Both authors present a vision of love that is comparable to many of 20 th century theorists. Whereas some theorists, e. g. Denis de Rougemont and Slavoj Žižek, claim that love essentially is a lie: it says one thing and wants another, it is actually the want of suffering or a power game, others such as Erich Fromm and Francesco Alberoni speak about it as a revolutionary movement towards social change and knowledge of the human soul. Both Sagan and Etcherelli support the latter view. Love is in their novels a metaphor for hope, it comes forth as a firm belief in the possibility of change, social as well as existential...|$|E
40|$|Suomalaiset ovat aina pohtineet Suomea ja suomalaisuutta paljon. Suomalaisuudella on voitu viitata moniin eri asioihin, kuten itsenäisyyspäivän paraateihin ja arkisiin itsestäänselvyyksiin, saunomiseen ja synkkämielisyyteen, kansantansseihin, Koskenkorvaan ja Kaurismäen elokuviin. Suomen ja suomalaisuuden kaltaiset konstruktiot eivät ole vain maantieteellisiä ja fyysisiä tiloja tai alueita, vaan myös mielentiloja, joiden rakentumisessa kulttuurisilla representaatioilla on keskeinen sijansa. Väitöstutkimuksen tavoitteena on purkaa suomalaisuuteen liittyviä ajattelutapoja sekä tehdä näkyväksi ennen kaikkea sukupuoleen, mutta myös sukupuoleen ja luokkaan liittyviä suomalaisuuden järjestyksiä erilaisissa media-aineistoissa. Väitöskirjassa analysoidaan suomalaisuutta erillisen johdantoluvun sekä yhteensä seitsemän, erilaisia aineistoja käsittelevän analyysin avulla. Aineistona käytetään muun muassa suomalaisten kirjailijoiden aikakauslehtihaastatteluja, erilaisia Tampere-kuvauksia sekä Aki Kaurismäen elokuvaa Tulitikkutehtaan tyttö. Tutkimuksessa tarkastellaan myös uutta luokkatutkimusta ja pohditaan, miten sukupuoli ja luokka eriarvoisuutta tuottavina kategorioina voitaisiin tehdä näkyväksi mediatutkimuksen opetuksessa. Tutkitut kertomukset suomalaisuudesta, sukupuolesta ja luokasta vaikuttavat ristiriitaisilta ja epäjohdonmukaisilta. Siinä missä hyvinvointivaltio on vakuuttanut kansalaisiaan tasa-arvosta ja yhdenvertaisuudesta, suomalainen (media- ja tutkimus) kulttuuri on järjestänyt suomalaisuutta hyvinkin hierarkkisesti. Ensisijaista näyttää olleen lähinnä (työväenluokkainen) maskuliinisuus, joka usein edustaa suomalaisuutta yleensä. Toisaalta tutkimus ja opetus voivat ohjata paljonkin sitä, mitä ja miten tulkitaan suomalaisuudeksi. Yhteiskunnallisen eriarvoisuuden lisääntyessä olisi aiempaa tärkeämpää kiinnittää huomiota sukupuolen ja yhteiskuntaluokan yhteisvaikutukseen myös mediakulttuurin tutkimuksessa ja opetuksessa, vaikka ajatusta suomalaisista yhteiskuntaluokista vierastettaisiinkin. This {{dissertation}} {{is composed}} of an introduction and six published articles and one refereed article manuscript. The articles were published in domestic scientific journals or books. The dissertation approaches the issues of nationality, gender and social class from the standpoints of cultural studies, media studies, gender studies and higher education pedagogy. Some sociological ideas are also applied to the analysis, especially {{to the question of}} social class and the context of the Finnish welfare state. The main research question concerns, what kind of roles media has in the construction of nationality and how these constructions are culturally gendered and classified. The introduction constructs the framework of the dissertation, concentrating on issues of nationality, gender and social class and their connections to media studies. Nationality, welfare state, equality, gendered and classified Finnishness, the ordinarity, orders and emotions are regarded as the main concepts of this dissertation. The concepts are used mainly as tools for thinking and discussing with, not as a ready toolkit. Methodological issues are reflected regarding the use of the writer s personal and the idea of situated and committed knowledge. The articles are divided into three sections: 1) At the top of the nation or at home? [Kaapin päällä vai kotona?], 2) In Tampere and at the match factory [Tampereella ja tulitikkutehtaassa] and 3) In the classroom [Luokkahuoneessa]. The first section includes two articles, which deal with the same material. The material consists of interviews with Finnish authors published in three Finnish magazines 1963 1993. The first article, Do you have the feeling as an author {{that you are going to}} the top of the nation? The literary orders, Finnishness and emotions [Onko sinulla kirjailijana sitä tunnetta, että olet joutumassa kansakunnan kaapin päälle? Kirjallisuuden järjestykset, suomalaisuus ja tunteet] presents an overview of the material and studies the connections of Finnishness, literature and gender as represented in the magazine interviews. The second article, The experience of writing: Finnish female authors in the magazines [Kirjoittamisen kokemus: Suomalaiset naiskirjailijat aikakauslehdissä] examines the interviews with female writers in more detail. The second section includes three articles. The first of these, In the search of the lost class [Kadonnutta luokkaa etsimässä] tries to find out what kind of category social class is, and what it means when taking seriously in media studies, especially when analysing representations. It also asks, what kind of category social class compared with gender and race, and develops tools for class and gender sensitive interpretations in media analysis. Some new conceptions, e. g. capitalist realism and romanticism, class cross dressing and disempowerment are also introduced. The second article of this section, Tampere women s town? [Tampere naisten kaupunki?] examines the representations of the (working-class) women of Tampere, which was once a major industrial city with big textile companies and a great preponderance of women. This article studies many heterogeneous materials from statistics to photos in order to explore, what kind of question the majority of women in Tampere has been and how it is represented. The third article in this section is called The Woman without Everything: Finnishness, gender, and class in The Match Factory Girl (1990) [Nainen vailla kaikkea: suomalaisuus, sukupuoli ja luokka Aki Kaurismäen elokuvassa Tulitikkutehtaan tyttö]. It examines the third film in the so-called Worker s Trilogy directed by Aki Kaurismäki. The analysis concentrates on how the distinctions are constructed within Finnishness. Special attention is paid to the protagonist s voicelessness, in the connection between hetero romance and money, as well as in the crimes represented in the film. The mixed feelings evoked by the Match Factory Girl in particular, and by contemporary Scandinavian melodrama in general are also contemplated. The third section, In the classroom, concentrates on the pedagogy in the higher media education. In the first article, Waiting for better times [Parempia aikoja odotellessa], I ponder on the ideal of multidisciplinarity and the idea of situated knowledge in the context of the university pedagogy. The main question concerns the possibilities of pedagogy as a radical practice of empowerment and liberation. The second and final contribution, Class and gender sensitive higher education [Luokka- ja sukupuolisensitiivistä yliopisto-opetusta] is an unpublished, refereed manuscript. First, I consider the absence of the <b>class</b> <b>question</b> in the Finnish pedagogical literature in general. After that I focus on the intersection of social class and gender in the higher education with reference to the ideas of critical pedagogy and feminist pedagogy...|$|E

30|$|To summarise: {{depending}} on their metacognitive development the children can disambiguate the <b>class</b> inclusion <b>question</b> in two ways. The younger make the question relevant by interpreting it as a request for an exclusive comparison of the subclasses; the older, by interpreting it as request for an inclusive comparison of a subclass and the superclass. The choice is constrained both by the cognitive and metacognitive capabilities in the logical or linguistic domains. The standard <b>class</b> inclusion <b>question</b> cannot be a valid test of the simple inclusion judgement because the child is not given a fair opportunity to compare a subclass with the superclass, so that failure does not demonstrate that the child does not possess {{the knowledge that the}} part is included in the whole. (On the contrary, the standard <b>class</b> inclusion <b>question,</b> provided it is supplemented with justification, may be a valid test of the knowledge of the necessity that the part is included in the whole, as failure is incompatible with the attainment of the required metacognitive knowledge).|$|R
30|$|Since {{its first}} {{appearance}} more than 70  years ago (Piaget and Szeminska 1941) the <b>class</b> inclusion <b>question</b> {{has given rise}} to countless investigations. Consider the paradigmatic case. A child is presented with the picture of a set of, say, seven flowers comprising two subsets of five asters and two tulips. When young children are asked, “Are there more asters or more flowers” (the standard form of the <b>class</b> inclusion <b>question),</b> the typical answer is that there are more asters. These children are said to fail the <b>class</b> inclusion <b>question.</b> Conventionally, a population is deemed to pass the question when the criterion of 50  % of answers “there are more flowers” is reached. Averaging across studies, this occurs between eight and nine years of age among school children in the western world (Winer 1980). The significance of this result in relation to the existence of many factors that influence performance has been hotly debated, both inside and outside Piagetian theory, with a peak in the 1970 s and 1980 s.|$|R

30|$|Now {{consider}} the <b>class</b> inclusion <b>question,</b> “Are there more asters or more flowers”. The subclass to superclass structure is identical {{but there is}} a lexical difference: Whereas the complementary class dog 1 is not lexicalised, in the <b>class</b> inclusion <b>question</b> the complementary <b>class</b> is lexicalised (the tulips). However, using a hypernym (in the plural) to refer indifferently to a superclass or to one of its subclasses is always correct literally and generally appropriate in ordinary speech (the exceptions stem from a possible distance between the subclass and the basic level: Microbes generally are not felicitously called animals). The hypernym is potentially ambiguous and it is the context of the utterance that guides the interpretation. Coming back to the standard <b>class</b> inclusion <b>question,</b> “Are there more asters or more flowers” it is clear that depending on the context, it may be relevant to give it either interpretation: (i) “Are there more asters or more tulips (flower 1)” or (ii) “Are there more asters or more flowers 0.” In the first case the children make an exclusive comparison and answer that there are more asters, the response that is deemed to be incorrect; in the second case they make an inclusive comparison and answer that there are more flowers, for which they are credited with a correct response.|$|R
