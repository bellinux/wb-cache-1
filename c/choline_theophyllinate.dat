50|$|<b>Choline</b> <b>theophyllinate</b> (INN), {{also known}} as oxtriphylline, is a cough {{medicine}} derived from xanthine {{that acts as a}} bronchodilator to open up airways in the lung. Chemically, it is a salt of choline and theophylline. It classifies as an expectorant. The drug is available under the brand names Choledyl and Choledyl SA, among others.|$|E
40|$|Nocturnal wheeze {{is common}} in {{patients}} with asthma, and slow release theophyllines may reduce symptoms. As theophyllines are stimulants of {{the central nervous system}} the effect of 10 days' twice daily treatment with sustained release <b>choline</b> <b>theophyllinate</b> or placebo on symptoms, overnight bronchoconstriction, nocturnal oxygen saturation, and quality of sleep were studied in a double blind crossover study in nine stable patients with nocturnal asthma (five men, four women, age range 23 - 64 years; forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) 0. 85 - 3. 8 1; vital capacity 1. 95 - 6. 1 1). When treated with the active drug all patients had plasma theophylline concentrations of at least 28 mmol/l (5 micrograms/ml) (peak plasma theophylline concentrations 50 - 144 mmol/l (9 - 26 micrograms/ml]. Morning FEV 1 was higher when treated with sustained release <b>choline</b> <b>theophyllinate</b> (2. 7 (SEM 0. 3) 1) than placebo (2. 1 (0. 3) 1) (p less than 0. 01). Both daytime and nocturnal symptoms were reduced when the patients were treated with sustained release <b>choline</b> <b>theophyllinate</b> and subjective quality of sleep was improved (p less than 0. 002). When treated with the active drug, however, quality of sleep determined by electroencephalography deteriorated with an increase in wakefulness and drowsiness (p less than 0. 05) and a reduction in non-rapid eye movement sleep (p less than 0. 005). Treatment with <b>choline</b> <b>theophyllinate</b> had no effect on either the occurrence or the severity of transient nocturnal hypoxaemic episodes or apnoeas or hypopnoeas. In conclusion, sustained release <b>choline</b> <b>theophyllinate</b> prevents overnight bronchoconstriction, but impairs quality of sleep defined by electroencephalography...|$|E
40|$|Sixteen {{children}} aged under 5 years with chronic asthma completed a double-blind crossover trial of treatment with oral <b>choline</b> <b>theophyllinate</b> (6. 7 mg/kg four times daily) and nebulised sodium cromoglycate (20 mg four times daily). The trial comprised three 8 -week treatment periods during which active sodium cromoglycate, active <b>choline</b> <b>theophyllinate,</b> and placebo were given in random order. Symptom scores for sleep disturbance, cough, wheeze, and daily activities were similar {{during the three}} treatment periods if results were analysed using Friedman's non-parametric analysis of variance. However the Mantel-Haenszel test showed that sodium cromoglycate was superior to placebo (P less than 0. 05) in maintaining normal daily activities. Either regimen is safe and well tolerated by young children...|$|E
40|$|Some of the {{pharmacological}} properties {{of two new}} compounds, choline 6 -thiotheophyllinate and the choline salt of 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methyl- 6 -thioxanthine (M&B 5924), are described. Both these 6 -thioxanthines are structurally related to theophylline and pharmacologically they {{are very similar to}} that compound, the main differences in their actions being essentially quantitative. They were more potent than <b>choline</b> <b>theophyllinate</b> as bronchodilators on the isolated guinea-pig tracheal ring preparation and as coronary dilators on the dog heart-lung preparation. Choline 6 -thiotheophyllinate was about as effective as its oxygen analogue in protecting guinea-pigs against the lethal effects of a bronchoconstrictor aerosol; M&B 5924 was more effective in this respect, but the relative bronchodilator activity was much less than on the isolated preparation. Both thioxanthines were less potent than <b>choline</b> <b>theophyllinate</b> as diuretics. One outstanding qualitative difference in their properties was in their effect on the voluntary motor activity of mice; <b>choline</b> <b>theophyllinate</b> in low doses was stimulant whereas the thioxanthines were either inactive at low doses or sedative at higher doses. In dogs, on the other hand, there were indications that M&B 5924 had a stimulant action...|$|E
40|$|Exercise-induced asthma (EIA) was {{provoked}} by standardized treadmill running for 6 minutes in 15 asthmatic children. The tests {{were carried out}} after the administration of a placebo, salbutamol, sodium cromoglycate, <b>choline</b> <b>theophyllinate,</b> and atrophine methonitrate aerosol in randomized fashion on different days. The mean post-exercise percent fall in {{peak expiratory flow rate}} was 45 - 2, 4 - 1, 19 - 6, 18 - 3, and 24 - 9 respectively. The proportion of children having significant amelioration of their EIA compared with those taking the placebo was 100 % for salbutamol, 80 % for cromoglycate and theophyllinate, and 60 % for atropine. Salbutamol, <b>choline</b> <b>theophyllinate,</b> and atropine were bronchodilators at rest whereas cromoglycate was not, and the ability to suppress EIA was unrelated to bronchodilator effect. Even after bronchodilatation at rest, further broncho-dilatation occurred during the exercise period...|$|E
40|$|Serum {{theophylline}} {{levels were}} measured {{throughout the day}} in 65 asthmatic children receiving one of two slow-release theophylline compounds. There was a wide interindividual variation in levels obtained with similar doses of pure theophylline, and also a wide intraindividaual variation in levels throughout the day, suggesting that the rates of release and/or absorption of theophylline from these compounds are not uniform. There were fewer side effects associated with taking these compounds than with <b>choline</b> <b>theophyllinate...</b>|$|E
40|$|Two dosage schedules, 8 mg/kg per dose {{daily and}} 10 mg/kg per dose tds of <b>choline</b> <b>theophyllinate</b> were {{evaluated}} in asthmatic children. The {{times of the}} doses were considered the most practical for use outside hospital. Theophylline levels were measured 2 hours after each dose and were satisfactory in both schedules. The levels before the first dose of the day were, however, unsatisfactory. We emphasis the desirability of measuring blood levels in any patient receiving a theophylline compound...|$|E
40|$|The day {{and night}} {{pharmacokinetics}} of assymetrical doses of slow release <b>choline</b> <b>theophyllinate</b> (Sabidal SR 270) were compared at day 1 and at day 4 of treatment when steady state had been achieved. Ten patients with chronic asthma were given oral <b>choline</b> <b>theophyllinate</b> 424 mg at 09. 00 h and 848 mg at 21. 00 h for 4 days. At regular intervals during day 1 and day 4 of treatment theophylline concentrations were measured in plasma and dried blood spots by fluorimmunoassay. Theophylline concentrations measured from dried blood spots were slightly lower than those in plasma, the difference remaining constant at all time points during day 1 and day 4 of treatment. On day 1 the mean peak plasma theophylline concentration was 5. 4 +/- 1. 0 (+/- s. e. mean) micrograms ml- 1 4 h after the morning dose and 11. 2 +/- 1. 6 micrograms ml- 1 4 h after the evening dose which were significantly (P less than 0. 01) different. Similarly the areas under the plasma theophylline concentration-time curves at night were significantly (P less than 0. 001) greater than those observed during the day. During day 4 mean peak plasma concentrations of theophylline after the morning and larger evening dose were 13. 2 +/- 1. 3 and 12. 1 +/- 1. 4 micrograms ml- 1 respectively, which were not significantly different. No significant difference was observed between the areas under the plasma theophylline concentration-time curves {{during the day and}} at night. However the post-dose time to peak was significantly delayed at night (6 h) compared to the morning (2 h, P less than 0. 001). (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|Controlled {{standardised}} histamine {{inhalation tests}} {{were carried out}} in 21 asthmatics to determine the degree of non-specific bronchial hyperreactivity with and without prior treatment with several anti-asthmatic drugs. A significant protective effect was produced by inhaled salbutamol, 200 microgram, ingested salbutamol, 4 mg, inhaled Sch 1000, 40 microgram inhaled atropine sulphate, 290 microgram, and ingested choline theophylinate (200 or 400 mg) producing serum theophylline levels over 10 mg/l. Inhaled salbutamol was consistently {{the most effective and}} was significantly better than the other drugs. The protective effect between the other four was not significantly different. Drug side-effects occurred only with the ingested drugs. No significant protection was detected after ingested <b>choline</b> <b>theophyllinate</b> producing serum theophylline levels of less than 10 mg/l, inhaled sodium cromoglycate, 20 mg given once or six-hourly for one week, or ingested ascorbic acid, 1 gram...|$|E
40|$|We {{agree with}} Dr Weinberger that ideally the {{starting}} dosage of theophylline should be small, blood levels checked, and dosage built up. However, {{many of our}} patients live {{some distance from the}} hospital and we feel that it would be impracticable to recall these children frequently to measure levels and adjust dosage. We prefer to titrate our patients by starting with a high dosage, checking levels, and then raising or lowering the dosage as necessary. Only 2 of 65 children who started theo-phylline treatment with slow-release preparations in the dosage we recommended (McKenzie and Baillie, 1978) had side effects that might have been attributable to theophylline, but in neither was the blood level> 20 tÂ±g/ml. We found that the incidence of nausea and vomiting in children treated with <b>choline</b> <b>theophyllinate</b> or plain theophylline (the preparation used in the Hammersmith/ Denver study (Hambleton et al., 1977)) was high (McKenzie et al., 1978) and that compliance, as others have found (Eney and Goldstein, 1976), was poor. These side effects may occur even when levels are within the therapeutic range or below it. We now rarely use these compounds, preferring the slow-release preparations. We agree that serum levels may be more constant in those children with fast clearance rates if the slow-release preparation is given every 8 hours. However, it must be remembered that the efficacy of theophylline is propor-tional to the logarithm of the blood level (Mitenko and Ogilvie, 1973). Trough levels < 10 jig/ml may give satisfactory control for many children and an extra dose just to raise the blood level would therefore be unnecessary...|$|E
