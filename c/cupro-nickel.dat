25|$|In 1920, bronze 5 centavos and <b>cupro-nickel</b> 10 and 20 centavos were introduced, followed, in 1924, by bronze 10 and 20 centavos and {{aluminium}} bronze 50 centavos and 1 escudo. Aluminium bronze {{was replaced with}} <b>cupro-nickel</b> in 1927.|$|E
25|$|The Indo-Greek kings in Southern Asia {{issued the}} first known <b>cupro-nickel</b> coins, with Euthydemus II, dating from 180 to 170 BC, and his younger {{brothers}} Pantaleon and Agathocles around 170 BC. As only China was able to produce <b>cupro-nickel</b> at that time, and as the alloy ratios are exclusively similar, {{it has been suggested}} that the metal was the result of exchanges between China and Bactria.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1862, coins {{were issued}} by the United States of Colombia. Silver coins were struck in {{denominations}} of ¼, ½, 1, 2, and 5 décimos, and 1 peso, together with gold 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 pesos. With {{the introduction of the}} centavo in 1872, silver 2½, 5, 10, 20, and 50 centavos were issued, followed by <b>cupro-nickel</b> 1¼ centavos in 1874 and <b>cupro-nickel</b> 2½ centavos in 1881.|$|E
40|$|Cathode erosion {{continues}} to be a problem hindering the widespread application of plasma technology. In this work, cathode erosion for various materials was studied for arcs operating in argon, nitrogen and hydrogen, using a magnetically rotated arc. Titanium and stainless steel were found to give extremely low erosion rates in argon (0. 2 and 0. 3 $ mu$g/C respectively). <b>Cupro-nickels</b> were shown to be suitable for nitrogen and hydrogen plasmas. The slope of hydrogen solubility vs. temperature in the cathode material was found to be important in determining hydrogen plasma erosion characteristics. When the plasma gas has a high solubility in the cathode material, or can react with the cathode, a negative erosion rate may result. When gas solubility in the cathode is low, oxide stability and mode of electron emission may govern erosion rate. A high gas solubility in the cathode material, as with hydrogen, can result in mechanical erosion due to micro-explosions in the cathode surface...|$|R
2500|$|In December 1894, after {{a series}} of test {{evaluations}} with both rimmed and rimless 6mm cartridges, the U.S. Navy adopted the 6mm U.S.N. or 6mm Lee Navy cartridge. [...] It was the first U.S. military round to use a metric caliber in its official designation, the first cartridge designed for use in both rifles and machine guns, and the smallest-caliber cartridge to be adopted by any military power until the advent of the 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge in 1964.

40|$|This {{research}} {{developed at}} University of Liege aims {{to optimize the}} complete semi-continuous casting process at LBP Company, a producer of copper-nickel alloys (or <b>cupro-nickels).</b> The process consists in vertical casting of 7 m long ingots. Some problems recurrently occur during casting process: formation of oscillations (wave length of about 500 mm), unsuitable concave cross-sections or internal cracks. In {{order to reduce the}} occurrence of such defects and to better understand their formation, we have been asked to develop a finite element model. The research focuses on two main topics: identification of material properties through laboratory tests and literature survey and the development of the numerical tool. The laboratory tests provide thermal and mechanical properties of the ingot and the mould, as well as heat transfer coefficients between the ingot and its surroundings (mould, air and water). These parameters are required for the numerical simulations of the process. In {{the second part of the}} research, numerical calculations have been performed using finite element method. Two types of 2 D models have already been studied: horizontal slice and vertical slice. This first choice has been guided by the high coupling between thermal and mechanical aspects of the problem, leading to highly complex systems of equations and subsequent long CPU times. However, due to the limitations of such 2 D models, a 3 D formulation has then been considered and it is still in progress. Peer reviewe...|$|R
25|$|In 1906, bronze {{replaced}} copper for {{the lowest}} three denominations; in 1907, a <b>cupro-nickel</b> one-anna coin was introduced. In 1918–1919 <b>cupro-nickel</b> two-, four- and eight-annas were introduced, although the four- and eight-annas coins were only issued until 1921 and did not replace their silver equivalents. In 1918, the Bombay mint also struck gold sovereigns and 15-rupee coins identical in size to the sovereigns as an emergency measure during the First World War.|$|E
25|$|Between 1960 and 1971, new coinage was introduced, {{consisting}} of brass 1- and 5-centavos, <b>cupro-nickel</b> 10-, 25-, and 50-centavos, 1-, 5-, and 10-pesos, and silver 25-pesos (only issued 1972). In 1977, silver 100-pesos were issued for circulation. In 1980, smaller 5-peso coins were introduced alongside 20-pesos and (from 1982) 50-pesos in <b>cupro-nickel.</b> Between 1978 and 1982, {{the sizes of}} the coins for 20 centavos and above were reduced.

However, inflation meant that in 1935, smaller silver 250 lei coins were introduced with nickel 100 lei coins being issued in 1936, followed by nickel 50 lei in 1937.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, coins were {{introduced}} in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 cents, and 1 dollar. The 1 cent coin was struck in bronze, with the others struck in <b>cupro-nickel.</b> In 1989, bronze-plated steel replaced bronze. A 2 dollar coin was introduced in 1997. In 2001, nickel-plated steel replaced <b>cupro-nickel</b> in the 10, 20 and 50 cents and 1 dollar coins, and a bimetallic 5 dollar coin was introduced. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe announced plans for new Z$5,000 and Z$10,000 coins in June 2005, although these were never actually struck.|$|E
25|$|The first decimal-coin {{issues in}} India {{consisted}} of 1, 2, 5, 10, 25 and 50 naye paise, and 1 rupee.
