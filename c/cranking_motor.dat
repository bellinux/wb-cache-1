50|$|A starter (also self starter, self, <b>cranking</b> <b>motor,</b> or starter motor) is {{a device}} used to rotate crank an internal-combustion engine {{so as to}} {{initiate}} the engine's operation under its own power. Starters can be electric, pneumatic, or hydraulic. In the case of very large engines, the starter can even be another internal-combustion engines.|$|E
5000|$|The {{electric}} starter motor or <b>cranking</b> <b>motor</b> {{is the most}} common type used on gasoline engines and small diesel engines. The modern starter motor is either a permanent-magnet or a series-parallel wound direct current electric motor with a starter solenoid (similar to a relay) mounted on it. When DC power from the starting battery is applied to the solenoid, usually through a key-operated switch (the [...] "ignition switch"), the solenoid engages a lever that pushes out the drive pinion on the starter driveshaft and meshes the pinion with the starter ring gear on the flywheel of the engine.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} to jumper cables is a cable used to interconnect the 12 volt power outlets (cigarette lighter outlets) of two vehicles. While this eliminates concerns with incorrect connections and generation of arcs near battery terminals, {{the amount of}} current available through such a connection is small. This method works by slowly recharging the battery, not by providing the current needed for cranking. The engine <b>cranking</b> <b>motor</b> current draw will exceed the fuse rating in a cigarette lighter outlet. Many vehicles turn off the cigarette lighter outlets when the key is turned off, making the technique unusable unless the ignition key is turned to the accessory or on position to connect the cigarette lighter outlet to the battery.|$|E

50|$|Relays {{are used}} {{wherever}} {{it is necessary to}} control a high power or high voltage circuit with a low power circuit, especially when galvanic isolation is desirable. The first application of relays was in long telegraph lines, where the weak signal received at an intermediate station could control a contact, regenerating the signal for further transmission. High-voltage or high-current devices can be controlled with small, low voltage wiring and pilots switches. Operators can be isolated from the high voltage circuit. Low power devices such as microprocessors can drive relays to control electrical loads beyond their direct drive capability. In an automobile, a starter relay allows the high current of the <b>cranking</b> <b>motor</b> to be controlled with small wiring and contacts in the ignition key.|$|E
50|$|It was {{the mixture}} of his {{experiments}} to develop purely abstract sculpture following his visit with Mondrian {{that led to his}} first truly kinetic sculptures, manipulated by means of <b>cranks</b> and <b>motors,</b> that would become his signature artworks. Calder’s kinetic sculptures are regarded as being amongst the earliest manifestations of an art that consciously departed from the traditional notion of the art work as a static object and integrated the ideas of gesture and immateriality as aesthetic factors.|$|R
50|$|A Hose Reel is a {{cylindrical}} spindle made {{of either}} metal, fiberglass, or plastic {{and is used}} for storing a hose. The most common styles of hose reels are spring driven (which is self retracting), hand <b>crank,</b> or <b>motor</b> driven. Hose reels are categorized by the diameter and length of the hose they hold, the pressure rating and the rewind method. Hose reels can either be fixed in a permanent location, or portable and attached to a truck, trailer, or cart.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Flapping-wing air {{vehicles}} {{can improve}} efficiency by running at resonance to reduce inertial costs of accelerating and decelerating the wings. For battery-powered, DC motordriven systems with gears and cranks, the drive torque and velocity {{is a complicated}} function of battery voltage. Hence, resonant behavior is not as well defined as for flapping-wing systems with elastic actuators. In this paper, we analyze a resonant drive to reduce average battery power consumption for DC motor-driven flapping-wing robots. We derive a nondimensionalized analysis of the generic class of a motor-driven slider <b>crank,</b> considering <b>motor</b> and battery resistance. This analysis is used to demonstrate the benefits of efficient resonant drive on a 5. 8 g flapping-wing robot and experiments showed a 30 % average power reduction by integrating a tuned compliant element.

50|$|Shotgun {{starters}} {{had several}} advantages over other starting systems in {{use at the}} time. Electric starters required large, heavy, and often troublesome batteries to be carried on board, or external charging equipment had to be located at every place where the vehicle was anticipated to operate. Inertia starters used a heavy wheel, usually made of brass, which was spun by a hand <b>crank</b> or electric <b>motor,</b> causing the spinning wheel to engage the starter ring gear. The Coffman system was more lightweight and compact than inertial starters or internal batteries, {{and it did not}} require any special auxiliary equipment, an important feature when operating in remote areas.|$|R

40|$|Near-to-reality {{endurance}} {{testing of}} bikes An innovative test setup for complete bikes has been built. It {{consists of a}} three main parts: -	a servo driven drum -	a servo driven brake actuator -	a set of two servo driven “legs” Any type of bike can be tested without modification, just by using a cantilever arm to push the rear wheel of the bike on the drum. The drum is used to drive the rear wheel of the bike and simulate inertia forces, slope of the track, rolling resistance and air resistance. Internal resistance to acceleration of the drum is compensated. Since the drum is servo driven, any net torque {{as a function of}} speed can be applied. The forces applied by the cyclist are reproduced by the servo driven legs and can be alternated with braking forces on the rear wheel. The setup has initially been designed to perform endurance tests on mounted brake systems. The brake lever is pulled and controlled in order to cause a specific deceleration of the bike. After release of the lever the bike is accelerated by the drum and brakes are cooled based on scanned temperature values. The braking cycle is then repeated. For any brake system the number of “cycles to adjustment” and the number of “cycles to failure” can be measured according to the international standard Eumos 40701 - 1. In a second faze the test setup was extended to allow for endurance tests on the driving train of a bike. Each pedal is driven by an independent servo controlled leg. The forces on the pedals can vary {{as a function of the}} position of the pedal and can depend on the actual speed. The drum is used to generate the real life resistance forces. The test is applicable for any type of derailleur system as well as for e-bikes using a rear wheel drive or a <b>crank</b> <b>motor.</b> Right from the first tests it is observed that the frame of a bike is crucial for both types of tests. Forces on pedals do cause global deformation of the bike frame especially during “in the saddle” biking. Real life pedal forces can be measured easily using commer¬cially available sensors. Measured forces are categorized according to conventional theory for accelerated endurance testing. Categorized forces are applied on the pedals. They can be inter¬rupted by simulating an emergency brake if relevant. Unintentionally some poor quality metal frames failed completely. For composite frames an increase in deformation is observed. Therefore it is concluded that this test setup is very suitable for near-to-reality testing of complete bikes. Apparently it is very promising to quantify relevant bike stiffness parameters and their decrease during bicycle life time. However further improvements of the current setup are recommended, e. g. introduction of reaction forces on the steering bar could be important to improve the correlation between lab tests and reality. Ultimately it is expected that the remaining safe life time of a bike will be predictable using the test setup as described. status: submitte...|$|R
50|$|Commonly used {{to shade}} a window, with a roller tube at the top, {{spring-loaded}} side arms, and a <b>motor,</b> <b>crank</b> or tape-pull operator. Awnings with sides are {{commonly known as}} traditional style awnings as they have been used for many years dating back to the early 19th century using cotton canvas fabric. Canvas was replaced in the 1960s by more acrylic materials and polyester in more recent times driven by a focus on the environment. Traditional style awnings are appropriate for historical buildings and are still popular today using a more weather resistant fabric such as a solution dyed acrylic fabric such as Sunbrella Fabric and a rope and pulley system for retracting the awnings. Awnings without sides do not provide as much sun protection as those with sides. Awnings without sides come in many different styles. Drop Arm Awnings without sides come with roller tubes at the top and are available with motors and wind sensors for automatic retraction. Spear Awnings are made without sides and are made with Wrought Iron Frames and they can be retracted with a rope and pulley system but are not available with motors.|$|R
2500|$|The 2010 {{season was}} {{a myriad of}} {{troubles}} for Ambrose. Engine problems, unlucky crashes and pit road troubles plagued his racing season. However, in the Zippo 200 at The Glen, Ambrose won his third straight Watkins Glen he held off Joey Logano and Kevin Harvick to win. Since the win, he started to gain some form, recording a top 10 at Atlanta and a top 5 at Richmond. At the Toyota/Save Mart 350 at Sonoma, Ambrose led 35 laps, and held a ten-second lead over Jimmie Johnson. His lead got erased by a caution on lap 104. During the caution, Ambrose turned off his car's engine to conserve fuel, {{but was unable to}} restart it. As a result, Ambrose attempted to return to his spot, but was forced to fall to seventh on the restart due to not maintaining a particular speed during the caution, and finished sixth. After the race, Ambrose stated, [...] "I was leading the race and had trouble getting the <b>motor</b> <b>cranked</b> back up a little bit there, and NASCAR made the call. I was trying to save fuel and the motor shut off. It didn’t recrank the way it should. I didn’t stop rolling, but it is what it is." ...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A wind tunnel based investigation into the effects of unsteady yaw angles on the aerodynamics of a simple automotive body {{has been carried out}} to increase the understanding of the effects of unsteady onset conditions similar to those experienced in normal driving conditions. Detailed flow field measurements have been made using surface pressure tappings and PIV around a simple automotive model in steady state conditions and these have been compared to measurements made whilst the model was oscillating in the yaw plane. The oscillating motion was created by a <b>motored</b> <b>crank</b> which was used to produce consistent and repeated motion which produced a reduced frequency that indicated that a quasi-static response should be expected. The PIV data are used to compare the wake flow structures and the surface pressures are used to infer aerodynamic loads and investigate the development of the flow structures across the surfaces of the model. This includes a comprehensive comparison of the surface pressures {{on the sides of the}} model during a transient and quasi-static yaw angel oscillation. These results show differences between the two test conditions with the oscillating model results containing hysteresis and the greatest differences in the flow field occurring on the leeside of the model. Two configurations of the same model with different rear pillar geometries were used to isolate model specific effects. Square rear pillars create strong and stable trailing vortices which are less affected by the model motion whereas radiused rear pillars created weaker and less steady vortices that mixed with the quasi- 2 D wake behind the model base and were affected to a greater extent by the model motion. The unsteadiness in the trailing vortex separation feeds upstream into the A-pillar vortex demonstrating that small geometry changes at the rear can affect the entire flow field around the model...|$|R
40|$|The {{in-cylinder}} flow {{is one of}} {{the most}} influential physical processes in internal combustion (IC) engine operation. It impacts fuel-air mixing, combustion and pollutant emissions. Many flow-related processes occur on a sub-millisecond time-scale. Time-resolved multidimensional flow-velocity data can provide valuable insight into processes relevant to IC engine performance. This document describes the development of a high-speed particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique using a two-laser, single-camera system and the application to a motored and fired stratified spark-ignition, direct-injection (SIDI) engine. The technique is novel in that it (1) achieves unprecedented temporal resolution: one velocity field at every other crank angle at 2000 RPM for approximately 500 consecutive cycles and (2) uses 355 nm (UV) excitation wavelength. Advantages include suppressing the detection of combustion luminosity, capturing the luminosity from the spark discharge, and providing the flexibility to integrate planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) of biacetyl for simultaneous velocity and equivalence ratio distribution measurements. Initial PIV experiments conducted in an optical SIDI engine are described and results from the first application of UV PIV in a fired engine at 600 RPM presented. Next, an experiment introducing the simultaneous application of high-speed UV PIV and biacetyl-PLIF is described. The application of UV PIV for velocity measurements in the SIDI engine at 2000 RPM is then presented. Velocity fields are shown for multiple <b>crank</b> angles of <b>motored</b> and fired engine cycles. The action exerted by the post-injection flow field on the spark plasma channel is captured. Results confirm that the ensemble mean kinetic energy decreases as the piston approaches top-dead-center (TDC) and that, under fired conditions, the flow pattern near TDC is dominated by the residual spray momentum. The effect of PIV measurement noise on two-dimensional kinetic energy and dissipation rate spectra of IC engine flows is described. Low-resolution (2 mm) and high-resolution (0. 35 mm) measurements show an abrupt increase in energy and dissipation rate spectra at the spatial resolution limit. This increase can be attributed to noise introduced by the PIV interrogation algorithm. A spatial averaging filter removes the spectral peaks, while attenuating kinetic energy and dissipation rate values near the PIV resolution limit...|$|R
