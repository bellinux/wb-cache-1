Silent Keith takes the {{opportunity}} to nap, as Matt easily passes without his assistance. Cory initially has a scary moment when <b>cutting</b> <b>corner</b> bead almost cost his eye, but afterwards he fails due to mixing his drywall mud by hand instead of using his drill. Angela passes despite her husband, while Deen, after having realized he built his wall three inches too tall for his liking, fails as he runs out of time. For Simon, who chose to close {{a hole in the}} wall with his wall, he must also attach a steel mesh to close the sizeable gap between the wall's edge and the wall. When on plastering he realizes that steel mesh is not the most appropriate job, he writes off his challenge, claiming that he would need 5 coats of plaster instead of the usual 3.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{developed}} {{method to}} predict the cutting forces in end milling of generalized corners is proposed in this paper. The cornering milling process is divided {{into a series of}} cutting segments with different cutting states. The mathematical model of the geometric relationship between cutter and the corner profile is established for each segment. Cutting forces is predicted by introducing the classical cutting force model. The computational results of cutting forces are in good agreement with experimental data.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the controller design for combined lateral and longitudinal Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) for a unicycle-type platoon {{with emphasis on}} the cornering maneuvers. A decentralized controller for lateral and longitudinal behavior is designed using input-output linearization by static feedback. A preceding vehicle look-ahead approach is adapted in the controller to maintain desired inter-vehicle distance. However, due to the position control of the look-ahead point, the follower vehicle may cut corners on turns. In this paper, the extension of a look-ahead point that is able to compensate the cutting-corner behavior is then proposed. To validate the theoretical analysis, the full nonlinear system together with the developed controller is simulated for two scenarios, a circular path and a particular path scenario, and a comparison is made between the system with the preceding vehicle look-ahead and the extended look-ahead. The simulation shows that the proposed lateral and longitudinal controller using the extended look-ahead eliminates the <b>cutting</b> <b>corner</b> behavior...|$|E

40|$|Across two studies, we {{investigated}} {{individual differences in}} the tendency to cut corners at work, and assessed whether a range of personality traits predict this behavior. In two independent samples of Australians (N= 533) and Americans (N= 589), we examined individual differences in <b>cutting</b> <b>corners</b> at work and tested sex differences and the surrounding nomological network of <b>cutting</b> <b>corners.</b> Collectively, we found that men {{were more likely than}} women were to cut corners at work, which was fully a function of individual differences in psychopathy, Machiavellianism, and conscientious. Various personality traits accounted for individual differences in the tendency to cut corners at work, indicating that individuals with this tendency may be morally compromised, selfish, impulsive, and not forward-thinking. Results were generally unaffected by contextual factors, such as the hypothetical risks and rewards associated with <b>cutting</b> <b>corners.</b> In our discussion,we focus on the deleterious consequences of <b>cutting</b> <b>corners</b> and the importance of selection and Human Resource practices that address the potential fallout from having such people in the workplace...|$|R
40|$|AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} is to report on a key finding of a larger study {{investigating}} the 2 ̆ 7 gaps 2 ̆ 7 in patient care that registered nurses encounter during the course of their practice. A key finding of this larger study was that 2 ̆ 7 <b>cutting</b> <b>corners</b> 2 ̆ 7 was a gap discerned by nurses. BACKGROUND: 2 ̆ 7 Cutting corners 2 ̆ 7 has been characterised as a 2 ̆ 7 violation 2 ̆ 7 and threat to patient safety, although there is a paucity of research on this issue. DESIGN: Naturalistic inquiry using a qualitative exploratory descriptive approach. METHODS: Data were collected from a purposeful sample of 71 registered nurses from emergency department, critical care, perioperative, rehabilitation and transitional care and neurosciences settings in Australia and analysed using content and thematic analysis strategies. RESULTS: Cutting corners was a common practice that encompassed (1) the partial or complete omission of patient care, (2) delays in providing care and (3) the failure to do things correctly. Corners were cut in patient assessment, essential nursing care, the care of central venous catheters and medication administration. The practice of <b>cutting</b> <b>corners</b> was perceived as contributing to preventable adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The study found that <b>cutting</b> <b>corners</b> created gaps that contributed to unfinished nursing care and preventable adverse events. The findings of the study raise the possibility that <b>cutting</b> <b>corners</b> is a salient but underinvestigated characteristic of nursing practice. Further research and inquiry are needed to deepen understanding of <b>cutting</b> <b>corners</b> and its impact on patient safety. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Identifying the nature and implications of <b>cutting</b> <b>corners</b> when providing nursing care is an important contributing factor to improving patient safety and quality care...|$|R

40|$|The <b>cutting</b> <b>corners</b> {{algorithm}} {{can be used}} {{to generate}} random numbers from any unimodal density which is specified only as a computer subroutine. This allows for a single program that can generate samples from Normal, Exponential, Gamma, Cauchy,..., and almost any of your favorite density with any parameters. Despite the extremely open nature of the problem, the algorithm proposed is extremely efficient, giving a random number in the time that it takes to generate four or five uniform random numbers. Even though it is slightly slower than the fastest algorithms, it more than pays for this in its convenience and generality. For unusual densities, it may be the only practical algorithm, and for the standard distributions it is provides an easy implementation. 1 Introduction The <b>cutting</b> <b>corners</b> algorithm provides a single algorithm to generate random numbers from any unimodal density.
