5|$|Mitchell and Galle sent an {{anonymous}} <b>complaint</b> <b>to</b> the TMB detailing their concerns with Arafiles's care of nine patients in 2008 and 2009. The letter {{said that the}} nurses feared losing their jobs if their identities were revealed {{in connection with the}} complaint. Arafiles became aware of the complaint and spoke to Winkler County Sheriff Robert Roberts, alleging that the complaint amounted to harassment. The TMB issued a copy of the <b>complaint</b> <b>to</b> Roberts with the understanding that it would only be used to investigate criminal activity by Arafiles. Roberts sent the <b>complaint</b> <b>to</b> Arafiles and to WCMH administrator Stan Wiley. As WCMH was a small hospital, details from the letter identified Mitchell and Galle as the sources of the complaint.|$|E
5|$|The <b>complaint</b> <b>to</b> Turkey had {{a desired}} effect locally, with an apology from the country's {{government}} {{and a commitment to}} breaking diplomatic ties to Germany if required. However, it failed to elicit a response from Germany. The Allies' request to the Spanish government was relayed to the Germans, but identified almost immediately as deception and misdirection.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{place of}} first <b>complaint</b> <b>to</b> a {{physician}} is a hospital emergency room. Up to 94% of those suffering from SCSFLS are initially misdiagnosed. Incorrect diagnoses include migraines, meningitis, Chiari malformation and psychiatric disorders. The average time from onset of symptoms until definitive diagnosis is 13 months. A study found a 0% success rate for proper diagnosis {{in the emergency}} department.|$|E

5|$|Beck filed a <b>complaint</b> <b>to</b> the WIPO {{under the}} Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP), arguing the domain {{name of the}} website was {{defamatory}} and asserted trademark infringement in its use of his name. Eiland-Hall filed a response brief to WIPO which cited the U.S. Supreme Court case Hustler Magazine v. Falwell, asserting the website's domain name {{was a form of}} free speech and satirical political humor.|$|E
5|$|On 24 October, {{it emerged}} that a Norwegian export credit company (Eksportfinans) {{had made a}} <b>complaint</b> <b>to</b> Norwegian police {{concerning}} the alleged embezzlement of 415 million Norwegian kroner (€47 million) by Glitnir since 2006. The Icelandic bank had acted as an agent for Eksportfinans, administering loans to several companies: however Eksportfinans alleges that, when the loans were paid off early by borrowers, Glitnir kept the cash and merely continued with the regular payments to Eksportfinans, effectively taking an unauthorized loan itself.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after, Swedish-Belgian Jean-Dadaou Monyas filed {{a similar}} complaint, which was {{supported}} by Afrosvenskarna, an interest group for Swedes of African descent. The <b>complaint</b> <b>to</b> the Chancellor of Justice was turned down as violations of hate speech restrictions in the Swedish Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression must be filed within one year of publication, and the latest Swedish edition of Tintin in the Congo appeared in 2005.|$|E

5|$|After three down {{years by}} UConn standards, the team {{emerged as a}} heavy {{contender}} for the championship in the 2008 season. In addition to all players returning from the 2007 team, #1 ranked high school player Maya Moore joined the team after a bitter recruitment battle between UConn and Tennessee. Shortly after Moore's commitment to UConn, Tennessee announced they were cancelling the annual series with UConn, thus ending {{one of the biggest}} rivalries in the sport. Even if both coaches remained vague and unspecific about the reasons of the cancellation, Tennessee filed a <b>complaint</b> <b>to</b> the NCAA about UConn's recruitment of Moore. UConn was found to have committed a secondary violation (involving a tour of the ESPN campus) and no punishment was handed out.|$|E
5|$|Exeter {{had been}} badly damaged {{in the battle}} with Admiral Graf Spee, and Dorsetshire escorted her back to Britain in January 1940, before {{returning}} to South American waters to search for German supply ships. On 11 February, her reconnaissance aircraft spotted the German supply freighter Wakama twelve {{miles off the coast}} of Brazil, which was promptly scuttled by her crew. Dorsetshire arrived on the scene shortly thereafter, picked up ten officers and thirty-five crewmen and sank Wakama to prevent her from being a navigational hazard. The following month, the President of Panama, Augusto Samuel Boyd, sent a formal <b>complaint</b> <b>to</b> the British government protesting against Dorsetshires violation of the Pan-American Security Zone in the Wakama incident.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Apple {{agreed to}} cut the price UK {{consumers}} pay to download music for their iPods after a formal <b>complaint</b> <b>to</b> the European Commission from the UK consumer group Which? demonstrated higher prices in UK for the same iTunes songs sold elsewhere in the European Union (EU). The Commission began an antitrust investigation in 2007 of Apple's business practices after the complaint was made, but ultimately the Commission probe found no agreements between Apple and major record labels on how iTunes is run in Europe, only that Apple had been paying higher wholesale prices to UK music labels and was passing the cost along to UK customers.|$|E

5|$|In May, del Potro had {{to retire}} again, {{this time in}} a first-round match against Andy Murray at the Rome Masters. During the second set, the Argentine {{allegedly}} made derogatory comments about Murray's mother {{which resulted in a}} <b>complaint</b> <b>to</b> the umpire. Del Potro's serve was subsequently broken three times in a row, and he suffered a back injury, which caused his retirement. In his second Grand Slam of the year, the French Open, he was eliminated in the second round by Simone Bolelli in four sets. In June, he reached the semifinals of the Ordina Open, losing to eventual winner and top seed David Ferrer in straight sets. For {{the second year in a}} row, he was knocked out of Wimbledon in the second round; he won his first-round clash with Pavel Šnobel in straight sets, but then lost to Stanislas Wawrinka.|$|E
5|$|In Turkey {{the plan}} called for {{diplomatic}} pressure on 8 June 1944, following the Normandy Landings, to allow the Allied forces access to Turkey {{for the purposes of}} staging an invasion of Greece (in support of the story of Zeppelin). At the same time the Soviets would make a similar request of Bulgaria. However, it was agreed that this risked a pre-emptive invasion of Turkey by German forces. Instead, the Allies took advantage of German warships being permitted, in June, access to Turkish territorial waters to transit to the Aegean Sea. A <b>complaint</b> <b>to</b> the Turkish government emphasised the Allies' interest in the Balkans and that they did not wish to see the Germans reinforcing the region.|$|E
5|$|On May 25, 2001, {{the print}} edition {{announced}} {{the sale of}} the Washington Blade to Window Media, LLC, a group of gay publications. With the new ownership came several changes to standardize the paper with other Window Media publications, such as the return of editorials to the publication after being missing for several decades. Shortly after {{the sale of the}} paper, staff at the Blade sought a vote to unionize {{with the help of the}} Washington-Baltimore Newspaper Guild. The Guild and the staff of the Blade brought a <b>complaint</b> <b>to</b> the National Labor Relations Board and deliberated for a few weeks over this issue resulting in a ten to eight vote against unionization on July 20, 2001.|$|E

5|$|On an {{ordinary}} day, a brown bear strolls {{onto the streets}} of Springfield, frightening the town. The bear is eventually subdued by the police. Homer convinces Springfield that {{something needs to be}} done to protect them from bears, and the town takes their <b>complaint</b> <b>to</b> Mayor Quimby, who gives in easily. Soon, the Bear Patrol is created. Homer is then shocked to see taxes have been raised five dollars to maintain the patrol, and this warrants another visit by the town to the Mayor's office. To appease them, Mayor Quimby blames the high taxes on illegal immigrants. He creates Proposition 24, which will require all illegal immigrants in Springfield to be deported.|$|E
5|$|Penn's brother {{revealed}} {{two days}} after the bout that the Penn camp would be making a formal <b>complaint</b> <b>to</b> the NSAC. In addition, Penn's head coach, Rudy Valentino alleged that St-Pierre also had an illegal substance on his body during his April 2008 rematch with Matt Serra. NSAC Executive Director Keith Kizer confirmed that improprieties had occurred in St-Pierre's corner. He witnessed St-Pierre's cornerman Phil Nurse apply Vaseline to St-Pierre's face and then immediately rub St-Pierre's shoulders and back before Nurse wiped his hands. Kizer had St-Pierre's back wiped down after the second round, and confirmed after the third round that no Vaseline was being applied. Kizer was critical of the cornerman's action, but expressed doubts that the controversy would overturn St-Pierre's victory.|$|E
5|$|Rory Swann is {{the chief}} {{engineer}} of the Hyperion. Swann came {{from a family of}} tech-savvy miners who opened a successful private mining operation on Meinhoff: however, their operation was crushed by ever-rising taxes. Swann lodged a <b>complaint</b> <b>to</b> the Kel-Morian Combine officials and discovered that Tavish Kerr, who's mining operations weren't burden with taxes, bribed officials to put rival claims out of business through excessive taxation. Swann started a miner's revolt, claiming independence from the Kel-Morian Combine. However, Combine forces arrived and mercilessly crushed the revolt. Swann himself lost an arm, along with many friends, and was only saved because Raynor's Raiders responded to their distress signal. Swann had nothing left, so he joined the Raiders.|$|E

5|$|Sentenced to 25 {{years of}} hard labor, Hartmann refused to work. He was {{eventually}} put into solitary confinement, which enraged his fellow prisoners. They began a revolt, overpowered the guards, and freed him. Hartmann made a <b>complaint</b> <b>to</b> the Kommandants office, asking for a representative from Moscow and an international inspection, {{as well as a}} tribunal, to acquit him of his unlawful conviction. This was refused, and he was transferred to a camp in Novocherkassk, where he spent five more months in solitary confinement. Eventually, Hartmann was granted a tribunal, but it upheld his original sentence. He was subsequently sent to another camp, this time at Diaterka in the Ural Mountains.|$|E
5|$|The Washington Post {{columnist}} Dana Milbank {{wrote in}} his 2010 book Tears of a Clown, that Beck had been baited by Eiland-Hall to confirm {{the importance of the}} United Nations. Alexander Zaitchik came to a similar conclusion in his 2010 book Common Nonsense, and pointed out the discrepancy between Beck's criticism of the United Nations as part of a New World Order with Beck's subsequent reliance upon the WIPO where he chose to file the case. The case was cited by Jude A. Thomas in a 2011 article published in the John Marshall Review of Intellectual Property Law. In a discussion of the conflicts between freedom of speech and trademark, Thomas noted that panels of the UDRP have concluded website operators had fair use over domain names even in cases where the name in question was exactly the same as that trademarked by the individual filing the <b>complaint</b> <b>to</b> the WIPO.|$|E
5|$|In late 1757, the Bani Saqr and Sardiyah tribes, who Zahir {{maintained}} ties with, {{launched an}} assault on the Hajj caravan as it was returning to Syria from Mecca. Thousands of Muslim pilgrims were killed in the raid, including Sultan Osman III's sister. The attack shocked the Sublime Porte (Ottoman imperial government), and discredited the governor of Damascus and amir al-hajj, Husayn Pasha ibn Makki, for failing to ward off the Bedouin. Husayn Pasha had been serving his first term as governor, having replaced As'ad Pasha al-Azm, who Zahir had peaceful relations with, and among Husayn Pasha's priorities were subduing Zahir and annexing his territories, which were part of Sidon Eyalet. Husayn Pasha lodged a <b>complaint</b> <b>to</b> the Sublime Porte alleging Zahir's involvement in the raid. Zahir denied the allegation and pressed for an investigation into the assault. He also sought to earn the Sublime Porte's favor by purchasing the looted goods of the caravan from the tribes, including the decorated banners representing Muhammad and the sovereignty of the sultan, and restoring them to Sultan Mustafa III (Osman III had died on 30 October). Moreover, Zahir's enemy Husayn Pasha was dismissed that year.|$|E
