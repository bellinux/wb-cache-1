40|$|On 4 November 2010, {{in an act}} of unity, all European Union (EU) Member States {{and three}} European Free Trade Association (EFTA) {{countries}} (Norway, Switzerland and Iceland) kicked off the <b>CYBER</b> <b>EUROPE</b> 2010 exercise. This was the first ever pan-European Cyber Security Exercise. The objective was to increase the understanding of how cyber-incidents are handled and test communication links and procedures in case of a large scale cyber-incident. The exercise was facilitated, organised and managed by ENISA and supported by JRC, the European Commission¿s Joint Research Centre. JRC. DG. G. 6 -Security technology assessmen...|$|E

5000|$|The first {{portion of}} the {{documents}} made public on 7 March 2017, Vault 7 [...] "Year Zero", revealed that a top secret CIA unit used the German city of Frankfurt {{as the starting point}} for hacking attacks on Europe, China and the Middle East. According to the documents, the U.S. government uses its Consulate General Office in Frankfurt as a hacker base for cyber operations. WikiLeaks documents reveal the Frankfurt hackers, part of the Center for <b>Cyber</b> Intelligence <b>Europe</b> (CCIE), were given cover identities and diplomatic passports to obfuscate customs officers to gain entry to Germany.|$|R
50|$|In March 2017 {{a series}} of documents, {{referred}} to as Vault 7, released by WikiLeaks revealed that the US government uses the consulate {{as a base for}} cyber operations. This diplomatic representation was known to be the largest US consulate worldwide, in terms of both personnel and facilities, and has played a prominent role in the US government's intelligence architecture for years. The intelligence personnel including CIA agents, NSA spies, military secret service personnel, the US Department of Homeland Security employees and the Secret Service employees are working in the building complex with high walls and barbed wire in the north of the city. In a radius of about 40 kilometers around Frankfurt, the Americans had also established a dense network of outposts and shell companies in Frankfurt. WikiLeaks documents reveal the Frankfurt hackers, part of the Center for <b>Cyber</b> Intelligence <b>Europe</b> (CCIE), were given cover identities and diplomatic passports to obfuscate customs officers to gain entry to Germany. The CIA station, in the consulate, is said to also collect Iranian intelligence in Europe, surveil on Iranian officials and target possible defectors who work in Iran’s nuclear weapons program.|$|R
40|$|Commemoration events, such {{as those}} marking the {{enlargement}} of the European Union (EU), are opportune occasions to reflect on ‘what we know’ about a subject and to identify some neglected and challenging opportunities for scholars in regional studies as well as social, policy and environmental sciences. I use this occasion {{to look at a}} series of knowledge base questions, that is, how much do we know about certain topics that are important to the EU’s present and future. There is a number of indicators one might use to answer this question, such as the number of library volumes on a certain topic or journal metrics. I use Google, the major electronic database, to examine the extent of our knowledge base about EU members and potential members and related topics, including boundaries and immigration, which are central themes in annual EU deliberations. A second perspective is gained by looking at our knowledge of EU capital cities vis-à-vis ethnic minorities, religious and linguistic diversity. I chose these issues as these are important in on-going discussions about regulations and policies. I map the member country and capital city data, because I think it is the appropriate method to see the extent of gaps in what we know about these topics. I preferred schematic graphics of cores, semi-peripheries, peripheries and deep peripheries to traditional maps with state borders we are all familiar with, because they are more appropriate to depict our knowledge about <b>Europe’s</b> <b>cyber</b> worlds. Cyber boundaries are fluid, dynamic and uneven. From these schemes, it becomes clear that the geographic knowledge base is very uneven. They reveal some consistency in our knowledge about member countries and capital cities, but also a fair degree of unevenness and irregularities. The EU knowledge world contains some cores and peripheries, but also some ‘knowledge islands’ and ‘archipelagoes’, which offer challenges for future scholars...|$|R
40|$|RT 51; The aim of {{the report}} “Terms of Reference for the trials” is to {{carefully}} present the impact of malicious incidents, or natural ones, on the main layers of an electric system. The single components of the service, physical, communication and cyber layer have been described and a procedure for the estimation of the possible damage of an incident has been reported. Attacks might affect large portions of the European power system, make restoration difficult and cause huge societal impact. In fact, due to the interconnection of the networks, a blackout {{in one or more}} countries could derive from an attack directed to neighbouring countries facilities, Thus {{there is a need for}} establishing the economic and organisational impact of the implementation of emerging cyber security frameworks in <b>Europe.</b> <b>Cyber</b> security needs first of all to define tests to verify the impact of standard procedure or countermeasures designed to limit the consequences of incidents on each layer. The report presents the test in order to verify: the security criteria and calculate the operative costs; apply the emergency or attach scenario; apply standards and countermeasures and evaluate the standards and countermeasures. The objective of this project is to identify costs and benefits for industrial stakeholders and for the society on an objective basis, and outline organisational processes whereve beneficial. To do so, a general procedure has been designed and applied on two particular cases of cyber - attacks: a SCADA based Control System operated by a TSO; a control room of a thermal Power Plant, operated by a generation utility. Along the text of this report, the aspects related to the physical system are included only to have a global view of potential attacks and the standards and countermeasures that will potentially reduce the vulnerability of the systems or speed up the restoratio...|$|R
