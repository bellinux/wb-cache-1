While this can be understood in a completely algebraic setting for systems <b>with</b> <b>commensurate</b> delays, {{this is not the case}} for systems with incommensurate delays. In the study of this class of systems functional analitic methods need to be introduced and general convolutional equations have to be incorporated.

5|$|Another {{burden of}} his {{promotion}} to First Lord of the Admiralty was that St Vincent was inundated with letters from aspiring officers {{and their relatives}} and friends. Soliciting employment from those in positions of influence in the navy had become common practice and was a generally accepted method of securing a good posting. The more influence that an officer could draw upon, the better and often more lucrative the position. Also, due to the peace with France the navy had been reduced and employment was scarce. The First Lord could not, therefore, provide every officer of influence a position and was obliged to reject many of the letters that he received. Despite St Vincent having declared both publicly and privately that officers would be promoted or given position <b>commensurate</b> <b>with</b> their achievements and not based on their political or social influence, the letters continued to flow to the Admiralty.|$|E

5|$|On {{the eve of}} World WarII, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{comprised}} twelve flying squadrons, two aircraft depots and {{a flying}} school, situated at five air bases: Point Cook and Laverton in Victoria; Richmond and Rathmines in New South Wales; and Pearce in Western Australia. An air force of this size did not require large-scale operational formations such as wings, groups, or commands, as all units could be directly administered and controlled by RAAF Headquarters in Melbourne. With the onset of war in September 1939, the Australian Air Board decided to implement a decentralised form of command and control, <b>commensurate</b> <b>with</b> an envisioned increase in manpower and units. The RAAF's initial move in this direction was to create Nos.1 and 2 Groups in November 1939, the former based in Melbourne to control units in Victoria, and the latter in Sydney to control units in New South Wales.|$|E

CBMC simulations also reveal the possibility of separating C 3 -nC 6, C 3 -nC 4, nC 4 -nC 6 and nC 4 -nC 5 liquid mixtures for which the adsorbed phase contains predominantly the shorter alkane. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the hierarchy of self-diffusivities is non-monotonic and is the mirror image of the hierarchy of adsorption strengths...|$|R
