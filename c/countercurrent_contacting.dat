40|$|Gas phase axial {{dispersion}} for gas-liquid <b>countercurrent</b> <b>contacting</b> {{in mobile}} bed contacting (MBC) {{and in a}} spray column were measured for 240 combinations of five variables, gas and liquid flow rate, packing size and density and static bed height, for MBC; for 114 combinations of three variables, gas and liquid flow rate and static bed height, for the spray contactor. The experimental technique was dynamic response to a tracer, coupled with moment equations for the system in axially dispersed plug flow (ADPF). The ADPF model was found to represent well the residence time distribution curves for all experiments with both gas-liquid contactors. Comprehensive correlations were obtained as axial dispersion number, D/u$ sb{ rm G}$d$ sb{ rm p}$, for MBC; as dispersion length, D/u$ sb{ rm G}$, for spray contacting. For spray contacting, gas dispersion length increases strongly with liquid flow rate but varies little with gas flow rate and column height. For MBC, axial dispersion number is very sensitive to packing size and to liquid flow rate, but has low dependence on static bed height and gas flow rate. Axial dispersion number is linearly proportional to liquid holdup, with this proportionality a weak function of only static bed height. The trends in axial dispersion number with operating variables for MBC parallel those for countercurrent gas-liquid flow in fixed bed contacting (FBC), but with the much higher throughputs possible with MBC than in FBC, axial dispersion number is typically about one order of magnitude higher. In both contactors the effect of axial dispersion on mass transfer is demonstrated {{to be very important}} at high recovery level. A comprehensive analysis of hydrodynamics and mass transfer in MBC is presented. For the model of transient response of mass transfer between two fluid phases, both in axially dispersed countercurrent flow, moment equations were derived for the general case and for one special case. These moment derivations provide the needed theoretical framework for future experimental investigation of the degree of interaction between coefficients of mass transfer and of axial dispersion...|$|E

Then, the rich solution (F 11) re-entered the regenerator unit from the top and had <b>countercurrent</b> <b>contact</b> with the up-flowing vapor, leading to further desorption of the H 2 S and CO 2 gases to achieve regeneration of the solution.

To reduce the cost, an efficient solvent mixture of tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TAMH), tetramethylene sulfone (TMS), and ethylene glycol (EG) is assessed. Gas-liquid equilibrium, reaction kinetics, and mass transfer models are developed and validated by experiments. Henrys constant, reaction kinetics, and mass transfer coefficients between CO 2 and TAMH-TMS-EG are identified. CO 2 loading and mass transfer coefficient are, respectively, obtained as 0. 55 mol/molTAMH and 4. 02 kmol/m 2 /s/kPa, which are on average 25 % and 34 % {{higher than the}} typical MEA process. The theoretical energy consumption amount for desorption of TAMH-TMS-EG-CO 2 solutions is identified as 1. 11 GJ/t to 1. 34 GJ/t.

The shape of the pH gradient, which ultimately controls the resolution and purity of the separation, can be controlled by making simple adjustments in the interstitial velocities of the liquid and solid phases. We have performed the separation of myoglobin and human serum albumin (HSA) using this device and achieved concentration factors of 1. 75 for myoglobin and 1. 2 for HSA. A mathematical model that has no adjustable parameters has been developed that predicts the focusing behaviour and capabilities of the CGC system.

40|$|The {{conventional}} Simulated Moving Bed (SMB) process {{realizes the}} separation of a feed mixture into two fractions by exploiting a simulated <b>countercurrent</b> <b>contact</b> of the solid and the fluid phase, basing on difference between adsorption affinities of the components on the solid phase. A major focus of SMB technology {{is still in the}} area of binary separations, however, an increasing interest in the chromatographic separation and purification of target compounds out of a multicomponent mixture has been observed recently. A major drawback of conventional SMB chromatography is the inability to produce a pure product stream if the desired component is neither the strongest nor the weakest adsorbable one. Therefore, several concepts have been proposed to achieve this goal through various modifications of SMB systems. Comprehensive overview of currently studied approaches along with their advantages and disadvantages will be provided. Modifications exploiting single SMB units, such as application of different adsorbents or using the variation of working flow rates during the switching period will be described. Particularly emphasized will be those techniques already being commercially used for ternary separations or having greatest potential for industrial application, i. e. coupling two (or more) SMB cascades in different arrangements, integrating more than 4 zones into a single unit, as well as commercialized by Japan Organo Co. pseudo-SMB process.

40|$|Simulated Moving Bed (SMB) {{technology}} is receiving {{more and more}} attention as a convenient technique for the production scale continuous chromatographic separation of fine chemicals. Thanks to the efficient simulated <b>countercurrent</b> <b>contact</b> between the stationary and the fluid phase, SMB units can operate under high productivity overload conditions. These lead to nonlinear competitive adsorption behavior, which has to be accounted for when designing and optimising new SMB separations. The so called 'Triangle Theory', which is briefly revised here, provides explicit criteria for {{the choice of the}} operating conditions of SMB units to achieve the prescribed separation of a mixture characterized by Langmuir, modified Langmuir and bi-langmuir isotherms. In all these cases, the effect of increasing nonlinearity of the separation, due to increased feed concentration can be predicted. in this paper, the use of this approach for the design of linear and nonlinear SMBs is considered, with reference to examples reported previously. Alternative strategies have been proposed in the literature, which are based on the use of safety factors for linear systems and on an adaptation of this for nonlinear ones. In the cases considered, which involve experimental data for a linear system and numerical experiments for a nonlinear Langmuir system, it is shown that 'Triangle Theory' allows attainment of a better understanding of and a deeper insight into the behavior of SMB units.

40|$|AbstractA {{liquid-liquid}} countercurrent centrifugal extractor with Taylor vortices {{which is}} appropriate for high-performance extraction has been developed. Until now, continuous extraction with more than ten multiple theoretical stages has been demonstrated by a single centrifugal extractor {{in the case of}} single specie (zinc extraction with di(2 -ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D 2 EHPA)). In the present study, the centrifugal extraction system has been applied to a multispecies case to clarify the separation behavior by countercurrent Taylor mixing. The extraction behaviors of lanthanides (Sm and Eu) with D 2 EHPA were compared among batch equilibrium measurements, rate measurements by a constant-interfacial-area cell and the continuous experiments by the centrifugal extractor. In the continuous experiment, the separation factor (SF = DEu/DSm) became more than tripled in comparison with the batch equilibrium value due to the multistage extraction effect caused by the <b>countercurrent</b> <b>contact</b> of aqueous/organic phases. The number of theoretical stages of our extractor was evaluated to be 8 to 9 in terms of DEu and 4 to 5 in terms of SF at the rotation speed of 1400 rpm. The SF value from the rate measurement data (SFnoneq; SF in non-equilibrium state) was slightly lower than the batch extraction data (SFeq; SF in equilibrium state) which resulted in difference between theoretical stages evaluated from DEu,eq and SFeq. Although this would slightly decrease the separation efficiency by the continuous extraction, the countercurrent multistage effect was still dominant. By considering this feature, a more effective separation process would be developed by utilizing the countercurrent centrifugal extractor with Taylor vortices...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHollow fiber {{membrane}} modules are extensively used as gas-liquid contactors for {{acid gas}} removal from waste gas streams. Hydrogen sulfide {{is an important}} indoor and outdoor contaminant, but, given its toxicity, {{a limited number of}} experimental results have been reported for this compound. Moreover, chemical absorption has been exclusively investigated. In this study, hydrogen sulfide odor control by absorption in water thanks to a hollow fiber contactor has been studied both experimentally and theoretically. The scrubbing of hydrogen sulfide from air gas mixture is investigated in two porous polypropylene (PP) hollow fiber modules of different contact area and fiber packing fraction. The gas phase is circulated in the lumen of the fiber bore and the liquid phase in the shell in a nonwetted mode, i. e. the membrane pores being filled with gas. The gas phase was run in <b>countercurrent</b> <b>contact</b> with the liquid phase at constant pressure. A laminar parabolic velocity has been employed to describe the convective diffusive mass transport equation which has been solved analytically and numerically. The calculated extents of hydrogen sulfide depletion reasonably compare with the generated experimental results for both membrane modules. Up to 85 % of acid gas could be removed at gaseous flowrates of 200 cm 3 /min for the large module and removals as high as 89 % at 10 cm 3 /min have been observed for the smaller one. The overall mass-transfer coefficients calculated from the experimental data, agree satisfactorily with those generated by the mathematical model.

40|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{biologicals}} are being manufactured today through a fermentation process, chemical synthesis or derived from natural products. One of the challenges in the manufacturing of commercial products is the recovery, isolation and purification of the target product from a multi-component mixture. Chromatography has been the method of choice for the separation of complex biological mixtures for the last fifty years. Recently, the Simulated Moving Bed (SMB) technique has become the mainstay of preparative separation allowing to achieve a higher productivity and reduce the solvent consumption in comparison to batch chromatography. The SMB process realizes the separation of a feed mixture into two fractions by exploiting a simulated <b>countercurrent</b> <b>contact</b> of the solid and the fluid phase, basing on difference between adsorption affinities of the components on the solid phase. A major drawback of conventional SMB chromatography is the inability to produce a pure product stream if the desired component is neither the strongest nor the weakest adsorbable one.

In the work to be presented a purification of a target component out of a multi-component mixture (which is considered in a simplified manner as a quasi-ternary mixture) using advanced SMB technology is investigated. Theoretical analysis includes detailed study of several different SMB configurations capable to purify and produce the component with intermediate adsorption strength. Analyzed are two coupled SMB units connected either via raffinate or extract port both operated with individual switching times, and integrated 8 -zone SMB units with internal recycle of raffinate/extract stream.

40|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{approaches}} to removing gaseous pollutants from effluent streams: absorption, adsorption, condensation, chemical reaction, incineration, and selective dif-fusion through a membrane. Absorption is an operation involving mass transfer of a soluble vapor component to a solvent liquid in a device that promotes intimate contact between the gas and the liquid. The driving force for absorption is the difference between the partial pressure of the soluble gas in the gas mixture and its vapor pressure just above the surface of the liquid. It is necessary to employ a liquid solvent within which the gas to be removed is soluble. Water is, by itself, quite efficient for removing soluble acidic gases such as HCl and HF and the soluble basic gas NH 3. Gases of more limited solubility, such as S 02, C 12, and H 2 S, can be absorbed readily in an alkaline solution such as dilute NaOH. Thus, when water is used as the solvent, it may contain added species, such as acids, alkalines, oxidants, or reducing agents to react with the gas being absorbed and enhance its solubility. Nonaqueous, organic liquids of low volatility can be used for absorption of gases with low water solubility, such as hydrocarbons. Examples of such solvents are dimethylaniline and amines. Organic solvents are often limited to treating particle-free gases to avoid sludge formation. To provide a large liquid surface area for mass transfer, a means of breaking the liquid stream into small droplets or thin films is provided in the gas absorber. The most commonly used devices are columns containing packing or reg-ularly spaced plates, open spray chambers and towers, and combinations of sprayed and packed chambers. <b>Countercurrent</b> <b>contact</b> of liquid and gas is employed to maximize the driving forces.

40|$|Worldwide {{demand for}} energy is {{increasing}} rapidly, partly driven by dramatic {{economic growth in}} developing countries. This growth has sparked concerns over the finite availability of fossil fuels {{and the impact of}} their combustion on climate change. Consequently, many recent research efforts have been devoted to the development of renewable fuels and sustainable energy systems. Interest in liquid biofuels, such as ethanol, has been particularly high because these fuels fit into the conventional infrastructure for the transportation sector. 	Ethanol is a renewable fuel produced through the anaerobic fermentation of sugars obtained from biomass. However, the relatively high energy demand of its production process is a major factor limiting the usefulness of ethanol as a fuel. Due to the dilute nature of the fermentation product stream and the presence of the ethanol-water azeotrope, the separation processes currently used to recover anhydrous ethanol are particularly inefficient. In fact, the ethanol separation processes account for a large fraction of the total process energy demand. 	In the conventional ethanol separation process, ethanol is recovered using several distillation steps combined with a dehydration process. In this dissertation, a new hybrid pervaporation-distillation system, named Membrane Dephlegmation, was proposed and investigated for use in ethanol recovery. In this process, <b>countercurrent</b> vapour-liquid <b>contacting</b> is carried out on the surface of a pervaporation membrane, leading to a combination of distillation and pervaporation effects. It was intended that this new process would lead to improved economics and energy efficiency for the entire ethanol production process. 	The Membrane Dephlegmation process was investigated using both numerical and experimental techniques. Multiphase Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was used to study vapour-liquid contacting behaviour in narrow channels and to estimate heat and mass transfer rates. Results from the CFD studies were incorporated into a simplified design model and the Membrane Dephlegmation process was studied numerically. The results indicated that the Membrane Dephlegmation process was more efficient than simple distillation and that the ethanol-water azeotrope could be broken. Subsequently, a pilot-scale experimental system was constructed using commercially available, hydrophilic NaA zeolite membranes. Results obtained from the experimental system confirmed the accuracy of the simulations...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{present the}} modeling, TRNSYS simulation, and {{parametric}} {{analysis of a}} solar water distillation system based on a humidification-dehumidification cycle. The thermal processes that constitute the cycle are carried out in devices designed for maximum individual efficiency. In order to achieve this, {{it is necessary for}} the evaporative process (in which an air current is humidified) to happen at the highest temperature attainable without boiling. This maximizes the amount of vapor that can be carried by the air current. This process is performed in a vertical packed column, where a stream of hot water falls as a current of hot air ascends in <b>countercurrent</b> and directly <b>contacts</b> the water. The air at the exit of the tower is saturated with vapor at the same temperature as the entering water, thus maximizing the amount of moisture carried. The hot and humid air then passes through a condenser that releases heat to the atmosphere, bringing air to nearly ambient temperature and maximizing distillate condensation. In order to achieve the previous, it is necessary for the thermal capture and storage system to work with thermal oil, an insulated storage tank, and evacuated-tube solar collectors. The system must maintain a steady oil temperature of 110 °C. We propose a condenser based on heat pipes and with excess heat transfer area for dumping heat to the atmosphere, in order for the condensation temperature to be {{as close as possible to}} atmospheric. The efficiency of the distiller is substantially increased by forcing the process to occur between the described temperature limits, not unlike what happens in the power cycles of heat engines. The thermal oil transfers energy to the air and water currents through two heat exchangers, and the insulated storage tank makes it possible to operate the system at night for as long as sufficiently hot oil is still available. A flow control system regulates the temperature reached by the water that flows to the evaporation tower. We used the simulation platform TRNSYS to model this system, including the evaporation tower and condenser. Using the climatic conditions of the city of Chihuahua, Mexico, we performed a parametric study of the system and determined the effect of varying the number of solar collectors, volume of the thermal tank, and flow rate of water. We simulated the behavior of the system over a year of continued operation, measuring the amount of condensate produced during that period. The objective of this analysis was to determine the variation of distillate production, in kilograms of water distilled per year per square meter of solar collector, and per cubic meter of thermal tank. This was used to determine the optimal characteristics of the proposed distillation system...|$|R
