5|$|Many former Austro-Hungarian naval {{personnel}} {{were incorporated into}} the new navy, 90 per cent of whom were of Croatian or Slovene ethnicity. The remainder were Serbs, or non-Slavs such as Germans. Their former ranks were recognised and, initially at least, rank insignia and regulations were adopted from the former Austro-Hungarian Navy. By 1922, the KJRM consisted of 124 officers and about 3,000 men. The number of officers had more than halved {{since the end of}} 1919, largely due to disillusionment. To fill the looming shortfall, around 20 graduates from each of the 1921 and 1922 classes of the Yugoslav Military Academy in Belgrade were sent to the KJRM. In 1923, the new Naval Academy at Gruž accepted its first class of 40 midshipmen, who were to undergo a three-year training course. All entrants to the Naval Academy had to be between 17 and 20 years of age, and graduates of high school or similar nautical school. Two specialist schools for petty officers were established, one at Šibenik for deck crew, and a machinist's school at Kumbor in the Bay of Kotor. Mine and torpedo training was conducted at Đenovići, as was pilot and air observer training. A gunnery school was established at Meljine in the Bay of Kotor. Šibenik was also the home of the main <b>coastal</b> <b>radio</b> <b>station,</b> the signals school and the basic and specialist training school for seamen.|$|E

50|$|The Marconi Company {{has owned}} or {{operated}} Canadian <b>coastal</b> <b>radio</b> <b>stations</b> since 1902, either as trans-Atlantic radiotelegraph links or as marine <b>radio</b> <b>stations.</b> While eastern Canada's ship-to-shore coastal stations were government-owned after 1915, the Marconi Company {{had been paid}} to continue to operate the facilities. Canada's west coast had been served by government-operated stations since 1907; many stations in the Canadian Arctic were military operations.|$|R
50|$|Initially <b>coastal</b> <b>radio</b> <b>stations</b> (German:Küstenfunkstellen) {{were used}} to gather foreign naval intercepts, and later {{additional}} resources were made available to reopen Direction Finding stations (German:B-Stellen, or Peilstationen) which were more suitably located for observation work. Cryptographic work restarted with leftover British wartime signals, and by 1922, B-Diesnt began the systematic observation of British signals traffic.|$|R
50|$|A coast (or <b>coastal)</b> <b>radio</b> <b>station</b> (short: coast station) is an {{on-shore}} maritime {{radio station}} which may monitor radio distress frequencies and relays ship-to-ship and ship-to-land communications.|$|E

50|$|The Kugelbake {{was also}} the spot where amateur radio pioneer Jonathan Zenneck experimented with radio {{communications}} between the Mainland and ships at sea {{during the winter of}} 1899-1900. A wooden hut was built within the structure, equipped with the necessary antennas and technical equipment for the very first <b>coastal</b> <b>radio</b> <b>station</b> in Germany. The first transmissions were sent between the Kugelbake and the steamship Silvana to a distance of 32 km. In the autumn of 1900, transmissions were sent as far as the Elbe Islands and Heligoland, 63 km away.|$|E
25|$|In 1916, as a {{consequence}} of World War I, the Royal Australian Navy took control of the station (and all Australian <b>coastal</b> <b>radio</b> <b>stations),</b> retaining existing staff and giving them naval ranks as non-commissioned officers. The Navy retained control until 1920. The Navy took control of the station again from 1939 to 1945, during World War II, again retaining the existing staff.|$|R
5000|$|A {{signal station}} {{is a form}} of Aids to Navigation that is defined by the IHO simply as [...] "A signal station is a place on shore from which signals are made to ships at sea".

50|$|Surf FM first {{switched}} on its Frankston transmitter on the 1st of October 2001. The name Surf FM {{was chosen to}} identify {{as closely as possible}} with being located in a bayside city. It was also selected to distinguish the brand from other names used by various <b>coastal</b> <b>radio</b> <b>stations</b> across Australia, such as Sea FM, Bay FM, Wave FM and Coast FM. Soon after the station commenced, some live programming launched, presented by a team of young adults programming a youth-oriented dance music format.|$|R
50|$|In 1978 one of {{the former}} RAF {{buildings}} {{on the east side}} of the site was refurbished to accommodate the relocated Land's End Radio maritime <b>coastal</b> <b>radio</b> <b>station</b> from St Just, about 5 miles (8 km) to the north, on account of the site being less susceptible to radio interference. The site was then owned by Post Office Telecommunications, a predecessor of British Telecom. Land's End Radio gradually became redundant, the maritime traffic having been transferred to mobile telephone networks and satellite, and it closed in June 2000..|$|E
50|$|A {{ship-to-shore}} {{radio station}} {{was established in}} 1900, and Niton Radio (callsign GNI) was maintained as a <b>coastal</b> <b>radio</b> <b>station</b> known to yachtmasters. It was featured in a British Telecom International information film. It finally closed, {{along with the rest}} of the coastal radio network, in 1997. The Navtex transmitter at St. Catherine's Lighthouse is still in operation as of 2013 (Navtex is a shore-to-ship service). For the purpose of extended Shipping forecasts, the Met Office uses Niton as the name of the forecast area covering the Atlantic from FitzRoy, North to Irish Sea and East to Thames.|$|E
5000|$|In 1900 Guglielmo Marconi {{stayed the}} Housel Bay Hotel {{in his quest}} to locate a <b>coastal</b> <b>radio</b> <b>station</b> to receive signals from ships {{equipped}} with his apparatus. He leased a plot [...] "in the wheat field adjoining the hotel" [...] where the Lizard Wireless Telegraph Station still stands today. Recently restored by the National Trust, it looks {{as it did in}} January 1901, when Marconi received the distance record signals of 186 mi from his transmitter station at Niton, Isle of Wight. The Lizard Wireless Station is the oldest Marconi station to survive in its original state, and is located {{to the west of the}} Lloyds Signal Station in what appears to be a wooden hut. On 12 December 1901 Poldhu Point was the site of the first trans Atlantic, wireless signal radio communication when Marconi sent a signal to St John’s, Newfoundland. The technology is one of the key advances to the development of radio, television, satellites and the internet.|$|E

50|$|In 1900 Fessenden left Pittsburgh to {{work for}} the United States Weather Bureau, with the {{objective}} of proving the practicality of using a network of <b>coastal</b> <b>radio</b> <b>stations</b> to transmit weather information, thereby avoiding the expense of the existing telegraph lines. The provisions of his contract called for him to be paid $3,000 per year, and provided with work space, assistance, and housing. The agreement gave the Weather Bureau access to any devices Fessenden developed, but he would retain ownership of his inventions. Fessenden quickly made major advances, especially in receiver design, as he worked to develop audio reception of signals. His initial success came from the invention of a barretter detector, which was followed by an electrolytic detector, which consisted of a fine wire dipped in nitric acid, and {{for the next few years}} this latter device would set the standard for sensitivity in radio reception.|$|R

Later that month a Naval Command was established, based in Zemun, near Belgrade. The Navy Department, now known as Navy Section, was then only responsible for purely administrative matters, with Naval Command responsible for all operational questions. The service's initially unrealistic expansion goals of 24 destroyers and 24 submarines were soon shelved, {{and by the end of}} 1923 the fleet consisted of eight 250t-class torpedo boats, four Kaiman-class torpedo boats, six s, four Schichau-class minesweepers, the water carrier Perun (ex-Cyclop), the yachts Vila (ex-Dalmat) and Lada (ex-Quarnero), the training ship Vila Velebit, the salvage vessel Moćni (ex-Gigant), and four tugs. Kumbor (ex-Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf) had been sold for scrap in 1922, and three of the minesweepers were disposed of in 1924, as were the four hulks. The four river monitors remained in service, as Vardar, Drava, Morava and Sava respectively. They were supported by two motor patrol boats and three river tugs.|$|E

50|$|In 1924, the Imperial Defence Committee's Communications Sub-Committee {{examined}} Australian <b>coastal</b> <b>radio</b> <b>stations,</b> {{and recommended}} the modernisation of the stations at Darwin, Perth, Rabaul, and Townsville. A year later, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) made a recommendation that two wireless stations {{be provided for}} the Navy in Canberra and Darwin. These would be strategic stations {{in addition to the}} coastal stations. Canberra was chosen as its distance from the coast would increase its protection from attack. Planning continued in 1935, where a new Canberra station would add to the coverage area of Rugby, and function as a fall back in the event of the destruction of submarine cables, or the Hong Kong or Singapore wireless telegraphy stations. The Australian government decided to build a receiving and a transmitting station in Canberra in 1937, with the transmitting station sited at Ginninderra Creek in Belconnen, approximately 20 km north-west of the main receiving facility.|$|R

50|$|All {{official}} communications out of Darwin {{were no longer}} operational. The antennas at the OTC <b>Coastal</b> <b>Radio</b> Service <b>station</b> (callsign VID) were destroyed during the storm. Station manager Bob Hooper, who was an amateur radio operator, helped to establish communications using his own amateur radio equipment, By 10 a.m. Gary Gibson another amateur operator was able to establish a station at the Darwin Community College, within {{a short period of}} time a network of stations was established across the country. This network, coordinated by Melbourne D24 police, provided message services to the cities of Perth, Melbourne, Sydney, Canberra, Townsville, Brisbane, Adelaide, Alice Springs, Gove, Mt Isa, Cairns, Rockhampton, MacKay, Lismore, and Cooma. By 10:40 a.m. VID operators had established VID2 on board the MV Nyanda in Darwin Harbour, and then for five days {{official communications}} traffic in and out of Darwin was handled via continuous wave radio (Morse code). The only local <b>radio</b> <b>station</b> that wasn't completely disabled was the ABC's 5DR; for the next two days, it was Darwin's only link to the outside world.|$|R
25|$|Further, the United States {{government}} {{passed the}} Radio Act of 1912. This act, {{along with the}} International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, stated that radio communications on passenger ships would be operated 24 hours a day, along with a secondary power supply, {{so as not to}} miss distress calls. Also, the Radio Act of 1912 required ships to maintain contact with vessels in their vicinity as well as <b>coastal</b> onshore <b>radio</b> <b>stations.</b> In addition, it was agreed in the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea that the firing of red rockets from a ship must be interpreted as a sign of need for help.

This decision was based on the fact that the rockets launched from the Titanic prior to sinking were interpreted with ambiguity by the freighter SS Californian. Officers on the deck of the Californian had seen rockets fired from an unknown liner yet surmised that they could possibly be [...] "company" [...] or identification signals, used to signal to other ships. At the time of the sinking, aside from distress situations, it was commonplace for ships without wireless radio to use a combination of rockets and Roman candles to identify themselves to other liners. Once the Radio Act of 1912 was passed it was agreed that rockets at sea would be interpreted as distress signals only, thus removing any possible misinterpretation from other ships.|$|R
