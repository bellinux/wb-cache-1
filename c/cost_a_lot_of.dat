5|$|These {{improvements}} would <b>cost</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> money, however, and this, {{in combination}} with the players' ever-increasing wages, sent the club into a period of financial turmoil. The club was presented with a winding up order in January 1902, and Bank Street was on the brink of being repossessed until they were saved at the eleventh hour by a wealthy local brewer, John Henry Davies. He and four other men, among them club captain Harry Stafford, invested a total of £2,000 in the club, now renamed Manchester United F.C., and Davies himself paid £500 for the erection of a new 1,000-seat stand at Bank Street. Within four years, the stadium had cover on all four sides, as well as the ability to hold approximately 50,000 spectators, some of whom could watch from the viewing gallery atop the Main Stand. The stadium was even deemed worthy enough to host a match between Football League and Scottish Football League representative sides in April 1904, hosting 25,000 spectators as the Football League side won 2–1.|$|E

The project cost $4million and removed the automatic turns to the Sunken Meadow and Sagtikos. Also the LISPC announced the widening at the western end would start later in the year. On November 28, 1965, the LISPC announced widening of the congested sections of both the Grand Central and Northern State between the I-295 (the Clearview Expressway) and Old Westbury. While federal funding helped paid the Grand Central portion of the $20million project, the $11.5million for the Northern State came out of the New York State budget. The project would not cost any homes to be taken down, but would <b>cost</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> trees to be taken down along the roadway. The project would also reconstruct the interchange of the Clearview, Grand Central and Hillside Avenue for a future extension of the Clearview to the Nassau Expressway.

In May 1804, Southey took the beginning of the poem to the publisher Longman, and he began to finish the second section in October. It was finished and published in two parts early in 1805, with footnotes and a preface explaining Southey's purpose.

That episode she met a chronically ill girl named Miyuki and attempted to cheer up. After this, she wears it around and pretends to help stop evil and believes she has superpowers. Later during the episode, Miyuki collapsed from overexertion playing with Mii. Mii tried to use powers she thought she had to heal her. The attempt was successful, and Ai revealed to the viewers that Mii's special power was healing. However, Mii remains unaware of this for {{a good portion of the}} season, and continues to believe that she has other powers as well. After the episode, Mii continues to cosplay in the outfit with the same type of antics. Mii is voiced by Toromi in the visual novel; in the anime she is voiced in Japanese by Momoi Haruko and in English by Jocelyne Loewen.|$|E
