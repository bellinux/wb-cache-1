2500|$|The spring {{had been}} {{discovered}} {{in the bed of}} the brook Bras Sec ('Dry arm'), a tributary of the Rivière du Mat. It had a flow of around 800-1,300 litres per hour, and a water temperature of 32°C, and its waters were iron-bearing, only mildly chlorinated and <b>calcic</b> and contained no sulphates. They were soon being recommended for children, weak and anaemic adults, as well as people suffering from gastritis. In 1852, the Société Anonyme de l'Etablissement Thermal de Salazie was founded, which built the spa, a casino and a director's house. Many creole-style villas of rich individuals followed.|$|E
5000|$|Theralite (from Greek [...] "to pursue") is, in petrology, {{the name}} given to <b>calcic</b> foidal gabbro, a {{plutonic}} hylocrystalline rock consisting of augite, olivine, <b>calcic</b> plagioclase (labradorite), and nepheline, along with accessories including biotite, magnetite, ilmenite and analcime.|$|E

5000|$|The ferroan {{anorthosite}} suite consists {{almost exclusively}} {{of the rock}} anorthosite (>90% <b>calcic</b> plagioclase) with less common anorthositic gabbro (70-80% <b>calcic</b> plagioclase, with minor pyroxene). The ferroan anorthosite suite {{is the most common}} group in the highlands, and is inferred to represent plagioclase flotation cumulates of the lunar magma ocean, with interstitial mafic phases formed from trapped interstitial melt or rafted upwards with the more abundant plagioclase framework. The plagioclase is extremely <b>calcic</b> by terrestrial standards, with molar anorthite contents of 94-96% (An94-96). This reflects the extreme depletion of the bulk moon in alkalis (Na, K) as well as water and other volatile elements. In contrast, the mafic minerals in this suite have low Mg/Fe ratios that are inconsistent with <b>calcic</b> plagioclase compositions. Ferroan anorthosites have been dated using the internal isochron method at [...] "circa" [...] 4.4 Ga.|$|E

Cooma granodiorite, Australia.|$|E
50|$|For {{this process}} to operate it is {{important}} that Ca is sufficiently present so that a fairly <b>calcic</b> plagioclase can be formed which in turn releases enough silica for the myrmekite vermicules. If only Na is present then no myrmekite will form.|$|E
50|$|Trident lavas are andesitic to dacitic in composition. The {{dominant}} phenocrysts are zoned plagioclase, hypersthene, <b>calcic</b> clinopyroxene, titanomagnetite, and rimmed olivine.

50|$|Feldspars {{crystallize}} from magma as {{veins in}} both intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks {{and are also}} present in many types of metamorphic rock.

50|$|A very {{important}} observation {{is that the}} maximum coarseness (tubular diameter) of the quartz vermicules shows a strong correlation with the Ca content of the plagioclase in the original, unreplaced, non-myrmekite-bearing magmatic rock.

50|$|Nephelinite is a {{fine-grained}} or aphanitic {{igneous rock}} made up {{almost entirely of}} nepheline and clinopyroxene (variety augite).

5000|$|Gujarat - AmbaJi White Marble: It {{is one of}} {{the finest}} marble {{produced}} in India. It can be easily compared with Makarana Marble. It is highly <b>calcic</b> and is produced in a town called Ambaji (famous for its temple of Durga Devi). The marble has a very soft and waxy look, and is often used by sculptors.|$|E
50|$|Troctolite is a mafic {{intrusive}} rock type. It consists essentially of major but variable amounts of olivine and <b>calcic</b> plagioclase along with minor pyroxene. It is an olivine-rich anorthosite, or a pyroxene-depleted relative of gabbro. However, unlike gabbro, no troctolite corresponds in composition to a partial melt of peridotite. Thus, troctolite is necessarily a cumulate of crystals that have fractionated from melt.|$|E
5000|$|Spinel, (Mg,Fe)(Al,Cr)2O4, {{is common}} in {{peridotite}} in the uppermost Earth's mantle, between approximately 20 km to approximately 120 km, possibly to lower depths depending on the chromium content. [...] At significantly shallower depths, above the Moho, <b>calcic</b> plagioclase is the more stable aluminous mineral in peridotite while garnet is the stable phase deeper in the mantle below the spinel stability region.|$|E
