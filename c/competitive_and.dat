40|$|A {{fundamental}} notion {{in community}} ecology is that local species diversity reflects some {{balance between the}} contrasting forces of <b>competitive</b> exclusion <b>and</b> <b>competitive</b> release. Quantifying this balance is not trivial, and requires data on the magnitude of both processes in the same system, as well as appropriate methodology to integrate and interpret such data. Here we present a novel framework for empirical studies of the balance between <b>competitive</b> exclusion <b>and</b> <b>competitive</b> release <b>and</b> demonstrate its applicability using data from a Mediterranean annual grassland where grazing is a major mechanism of competitive release. Empirical data on the balance between <b>competitive</b> exclusion <b>and</b> <b>competitive</b> release are crucial for understanding observed patterns of variation in local species diversity and the proposed approach provides a simple framework for the collection, interpretation, and synthesis of such data...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of <b>competitive</b> priorities <b>and</b> <b>competitive</b> advantage has been {{emphasized in the}} strategic management literature. Furthermore, the literature review suggests relationships exist between <b>competitive</b> priorities <b>and</b> <b>competitive</b> advantage in business organizations. However, the review of past studies indicate that limited research {{attempts have been made}} to investigate the relationships between <b>competitive</b> priorities <b>and</b> <b>competitive</b> advantage among business organizations, particularly among real estate firms. This study attempted to address this research issue by examining <b>competitive</b> priorities <b>and</b> <b>competitive</b> advantage among real estate firms in Dubai. The data for the study was collected by using structured questionnaires mailed to 30 managers who worked in six real estate firms in Dubai. The results of the analyses of the data collected in the study indicated that the firms in the study emphasized competitive priorities that included flexibility, cost, quality and delivery.

40|$|Purpose: First {{purpose of}} this study is to discuss the {{synergic}} and separate use of knowledge and intelligence, via knowledge management <b>and</b> <b>competitive</b> intelligence, in each stage of strategic management process. Second purpose is to discuss the implications of each stage of strategic management process for knowledge management <b>and</b> <b>competitive</b> intelligence <b>and</b> vice versa. Methodology/Design/Approach: A systematic literature review was performed within timeframe of 2000 to 2016. Extracted information from reviewed studies was synthesized and integrated in strategic management model of Fred David. Findings: A strategic management model with lens of knowledge management <b>and</b> <b>competitive</b> intelligence is proposed. Each stage of knowledge management process has implications for knowledge management <b>and</b> <b>competitive</b> intelligence <b>and</b> vice versa. In addition, synergic and separate use of knowledge and intelligence results in effective decision making leading to competitive advantage. Research Limitations: Learning curve of knowledge management <b>and</b> <b>competitive</b> intelligence <b>and</b> being limited to use of Fred David model are among key limitations. Practical Implications: Experts of knowledge management, <b>competitive</b> intelligence, <b>and</b> strategic management can use this study to gain competitive advantage based on knowledge and information resources. Organizations should have knowledge management function as well as competitive intelligence to support the strategy formulation, implementation and evaluation. Social Implications: Readers can take a view that how they can manage their knowledge and information resources from a strategic perspective? Originality/Value:.

Ten-year government bonds were issued below 6%, lower than some of the PIIGS nations in the EU (Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain).

Curve estimation showed that <b>competitive</b> anxiety <b>and</b> self-confidence decreased and increased over time, respectively. Moreover, the dynamical patterns were more nonlinear for swimmers than for table tennis players, indicating that the PM experience is dependent on the sport context. Consistent with the opposite dynamics of <b>competitive</b> anxiety <b>and</b> self-confidence, correlation analyses revealed a strong negative relationship between these variables, suggesting that PM constraints the relationship between <b>competitive</b> anxiety <b>and</b> self-confidence.
