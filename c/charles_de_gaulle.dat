5|$|There {{was also}} growing {{concern that the}} calls by Prince Sihanouk of Cambodia for the {{neutralization}} of his own country, and his attempts to convene an international conference on the matter, would increase such sentiment in Vietnam, something that was oft-repeated in the American media.

5|$|After World War II, the Kanak {{independence}} movement again picked up momentum when the United Nations placed New Caledonia on its Decolonisation List of Non-Self-Governing Territories in 1946. A major progression occurred when Kanaks and French {{settlers in the}} country obtained voting rights in 1951, shortly before it became an overseas territory of France in 1956. The Kanaks were then also allowed {{to move out of}} their reserve areas. This was followed by the establishment of the Territorial Assembly in 1957, but this was short-lived; <b>Charles</b> <b>de</b> <b>Gaulle</b> abolished it after he became the President of France, in 1958.|$|E
5|$|After {{the landing}} at Normandy, {{a revival of}} Anvil became {{increasingly}} attractive to the Allied planners. The Normandy ports had insufficient capacity to handle Allied supply needs {{and at the same}} time French generals under <b>Charles</b> <b>de</b> <b>Gaulle</b> pressed for a direct attack on Southern France with participation of French troops. These factors led to a reconsideration of the plan. Despite Churchill's objections, the operation was authorized by the Allied Combined Chiefs of Staff on 14July and then renamed Dragoon on 1August. The landing was scheduled for 15August.|$|E
5|$|Another {{conflict}} {{that is part}} of the party's background was the Algerian War (many frontistes, including Le Pen, were directly involved in the war), and the right-wing dismay over the decision by French President <b>Charles</b> <b>de</b> <b>Gaulle</b> to abandon his promise of holding on to French Algeria. In the 1965 presidential election, Le Pen unsuccessfully attempted to consolidate the right-wing vote around the right-wing presidential candidate Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the French far-right consisted mainly of small extreme movements such as Occident, Groupe Union Défense (GUD), and the Ordre Nouveau (ON).|$|E

In February 1942, Aubame met colonial administrator Félix Éboué and quickly became his protégé. He served as an informant for Éboué on African affairs. Aubame's reward was {{to be one of}} several Africans promoted on 23 February 1943 into the European section of the civil service, and on 1 January 1944 Éboué appointed him president of the municipal commission for the Poto-Poto section of Brazzaville.|$|E
5|$|Nouakchott {{is built}} around a large tree-lined street, Avenue Gamal Abdel Nasser, which runs {{northeast}} through the city centre from the airport. It divides the city into two, with the residential areas {{in the north and}} the medina quarter, along with the kebbe, a shanty town formed due to the displacement of people from other areas by the desert. Other major streets are named (in French) for notable Mauritanian or international figures of the 1960s: Avenue Abdel Nasser, Avenue <b>Charles</b> <b>de</b> <b>Gaulle,</b> Avenue Kennedy, and Avenue Lumumba, for example.|$|E
5|$|Second Lieutenant Ndo Edou gave {{instructions}} to transfer M'ba to Ndjolé, Aubame's electoral stronghold. However, due to heavy rain, the deposed {{president and his}} captors took shelter in an unknown village. The next morning they decided to take him over the easier road to Lambaréné. Several hours later, they returned to Libreville. The new head of government contacted French ambassador Paul Cousseran, to assure him that the property of foreign nationals would be protected and to request against French military intervention. In Paris, President <b>Charles</b> <b>de</b> <b>Gaulle</b> decided against the plea.|$|E
