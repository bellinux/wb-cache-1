50|$|The {{continuing}} Sud Express runs as a {{night train}} from Irun at the French/Spanish border to Lisbon and from Lisbon to Hendaye. Until April 2010, facilities existed for 2nd class seated accommodation, 2nd class <b>couchette</b> <b>cars</b> (6-bunk compartments), and 1st class private sleeping compartments for 1, 2 or 3 passengers.|$|R
50|$|The sleeping-cars are type MU, {{a design}} {{originally}} {{created for the}} Wagons-Lits Company, built 1964-1974 but refurbished by Trenitalia in the mid-2000s when LED lighting & corridor CCTV were fitted and carpets removed. Each sleeping-car has 12 compartments with washbasin, each usable as single, double or triple. <b>Couchette</b> <b>cars</b> are of various types {{and can be used}} as 4 berth or 6-berth.|$|R
5000|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were subsequently}} deployed for rail transportation in Kosovo moving trains within Kosovo and {{to and from}} Skopje in Macedonia. [...] The German <b>couchette</b> <b>car</b> 51 80 59-40 046-6 that had joined the train in Aachen also stayed in Kosovo. [...] The three Class 20 locomotives were scheduled to stay for three months. After six-months in Kosovo the three locomotives left Kosovo {{and returned to the}} United Kingdom by sea. The German couchette was scrapped, as part of DBs removal of ex-Deutsche Reichsbahn coaching stock.|$|E
5000|$|Typically, in 2nd {{class the}} seat {{serves as the}} lowest bunk, {{and the back of}} the seat is turned into a {{horizontal}} position and serves as the middle bunk. There are two types of <b>couchette</b> <b>car</b> in countries of the former USSR: [...] "coupé" [...] and [...] "platzkart". [...] "Coupé" [...] cars are more expensive and comfortable with 4-bunk compartments fully separated from each other and the corridor. The cheaper [...] "Platzkart" [...] cars, use a somewhat different layout, with no wall between compartment and corridor, only four bunks along the long sides of the compartment, and two more mounted on the corridor wall, the lower bunk folding in the daytime to become two seats.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the first}} ICE1 power cars were {{commissioned}} in late 1989, the intermediate cars {{were not yet}} available. Instead, they were coupled to retired <b>couchette</b> <b>cars</b> (type yl) that were homologated for 200km/h. These were fitted with special couplings for compatibility to the power cars. Usually, Class 110 locomotives served as Angstlok {{as well as for}} pulling the train on the return trip. For braking tests, the locos were sometimes coupled between two power cars, with match wagons on both sides. The test runs usually started at the Opladen repair workshop and used lines in the vicinity. Fast runs at up to 200km/h were to Bielefeld and Bremen. Because of time pressure, some power cars ware used for tests that had not yet been accepted by Bundesbahn. For longer test runs, two [...] "dummy trainsets" [...] comprising eleven <b>couchette</b> <b>cars</b> and ten InterCity cars (type Bm235) respectively were used to replace the missing intermediate cars.|$|R
25|$|In modern Europe, {{a number}} of {{sleeping}} car services continue to operate, though they face strong competition from high-speed day trains and budget airlines, sometimes leading to the cancellation or consolidation of services. In some cases, trains are split and recombined {{in the dead of}} night, making it possible to offer several connections with {{a relatively small number of}} trains. Generally, the trains consist of sleeping cars with private compartments, <b>couchette</b> <b>cars,</b> and sometimes cars with normal seating.|$|R
5000|$|Modern, air {{conditioned}} sleeping <b>cars</b> and <b>couchette</b> <b>cars</b> {{are part of}} Croatian Railways rolling stock. Croatian sleeping coaches include single, double or 4-beds compartments with washbasin and many additional hygienic accessories. Passengers also have catering services on their disposal and are given complementary breakfast {{depending on the type}} of bought ticket. In Croatia, night train with sleeping carriages included operates on route between two largest Croatian towns, Zagreb and Split. Regarding international transport, Croatian sleeping coaches are included on EuroNight lines Zagreb-Munich-Zagreb and Zagreb-Zürich-Zagreb.|$|R
50|$|It is {{noteworthy}} that <b>couchette</b> <b>cars</b> have never been operated in Britain (except on the Royal Train, presumably as staff accommodation); it was normal practice, nevertheless, for British passengers to join long-distance overnight trains at Calais, Boulogne, Oostende or Hoek van Holland after crossing the English Channel or North Sea by ferry. There has been a substantial {{decline in the number}} of long-distance overnight train services since the mid-1990s, caused by the increase in the number of high-speed daytime services, and competition from low-cost airlines.|$|R
50|$|Sleeping cars {{outfitted}} with (generally) small bedrooms allow passengers to sleep through their night-time trips, while <b>couchette</b> <b>cars</b> provide more basic sleeping accommodation. Long-distance trains often require baggage cars for the passengers' luggage. In European practice {{it used to}} be common for day coaches to be formed of compartments seating 6 or 8 passengers, with access from a side corridor. In the UK, Corridor coaches fell into disfavor in the 1960s and 1970s partially because open coaches are considered more secure by women traveling alone.|$|R
50|$|The {{train is}} {{composed}} {{of one or two}} sleeping cars type MUn with compartments of up to three berths and one deluxe compartment with private bathroom, <b>couchette</b> <b>cars</b> with six berth compartments and coaches with six seat compartments that can also be used for morning or evening travel within Austria. The sleeping-car to Milano is a rebuilt T2S type with two-berth compartments and two deluxe compartments. On certain days in summer, the train carries autoracks from Wien Hauptbahnhof to Verona Porta Nuova. All rolling stock belongs to the Austrian Federal Railways.|$|R
50|$|The line is {{used for}} both long-distance and local {{passenger}} services as well as goods trains. In long-distance traffic individual trains on InterCity services (nos. 26, 27, 30 and 51) stop at the Stralsund and Bergen, before continuing to Binz. These trains are usually hauled by electric locomotives of classes 101 and 120. In addition, a single Berlin Night Express pair of trains runs between Berlin and the Swedish city of Malmö without stopping on Rügen. The night train, which comprises sleepers and <b>couchette</b> <b>cars,</b> is hauled by Class 182 electric locomotives.|$|R
50|$|The {{service is}} usually the same in all classes on Russian Railways, the main {{difference}} being the increased personal space, reduced noise, and better isolation from unwanted contact with strangers, as well as better amenities; lower class cars may have a single shower per two <b>couchette</b> <b>cars</b> (54 passengers), while SV cars have one per 16 passengers, and in a Premium car each passenger has their own shower, an important consideration on lines such as the Trans-Siberian on which travel may last {{for up to a}} full week.|$|R
5000|$|On 31 May 1987, the Komet {{was one of}} {{the eight}} initial night {{services}} in the then-new EuroCity (EC) network. Its route continued to be Hamburg - Chur, and it operated seven days a week on this route, carrying sleeping <b>cars</b> and <b>couchette</b> <b>cars</b> only. One day a week, in summer and winter only, the EC Komet also carried through coaches (sleeping <b>cars</b> and <b>couchettes)</b> from Hamburg to Brig; these were carried southbound on Fridays and northbound on Saturdays. [...] On the portion within Switzerland, the train was not designated as an EC.|$|R
5000|$|City Night Line trains {{were made}} up of {{compartment}} or open-saloon coaches with reclining seats, <b>couchette</b> <b>cars,</b> sleeping cars and dining cars. All lines had a special compartment for passengers with restricted mobility. To facilitate the carriage of luggage, either combined <b>couchette</b> and luggage <b>cars</b> were used or seated cars with a special luggage/bicycle compartment. New sleeping cars were designed specially for City Night Line and 2 different types are currently in use: the double-deck sleeping car (type 171.X and 172.X) and Comfortline (type 173.1). The cars were air-conditioned and each compartment has two or three berths, Deluxe cars have a private bathroom (shower, washbasin and WC). There was otherwise a washbasin in each compartment; shower and WC are in the aisle. Laptop connections were only available in the newer Comfortline cars. The compartments had [...] "normal" [...] beds.|$|R
50|$|The {{line had}} {{significant}} use for north-south long-distance traffic until the 1970s and 1980s. There were semi-fast trains (Eilzug) and express trains (Durchgangszug) with portions running from Osnabrück or Bielefeld via Warburg and Kassel to Munich via Würzburg (including a night train with sleeping and <b>couchette</b> <b>cars)</b> and to Basel. In the north semi-fast trains reached Hamburg or Cuxhaven. Some semi-fast trains ran as a diesel railcar or as a locomotive-hauled push-pull train on the Solling Railway to the Harz. The line was {{served by a}} pair of semi-fast trains between Enschede and Bad Pyrmont with reversal in Himmighausen.|$|R
25|$|Another of {{the more}} {{substantial}} examples of current European sleeping car service is the Train Bleu, an all-sleeping-car train. The train leaves Paris from the Gare d'Austerlitz in mid evening and arrives in Nice about 8 in the morning, providing both first-class rooms and couchette accommodations. The train's principal popularity is with older travelers; it has not won {{the same degree of}} popularity with younger travelers. Recently, the upper class coaches (wagons lits) have been sold to foreign railroad companies, so that only <b>couchette</b> <b>cars</b> (1st and 2nd class) as well as seating coaches remain. The Train Bleu is part of the French night service network called Intercités de Nuit.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to Sassnitz station {{there is the}} ferry station of Mukran. Even before the First World War, Sassnitz Hafen railway station was established in Sassnitz as a ferry terminal for the so-called Kings Line from Germany to Sweden (Trelleborg). In the 1980s, a new ferry terminal with broad- and standard gauge tracks {{was built in the}} subdistrict of Mukran. From Mukran there are ferries to and from Klaipeda in Lithuania, to Bornholm and St. Petersburg. On the ferry to Sweden, railway wagons are transported in {{addition to}} road vehicles. As well as the Berlin to Malmö night train, with sleeping and <b>couchette</b> <b>cars,</b> there were about 60,000 wagons in 2004.|$|R
50|$|The {{station has}} a loading dock for {{motorail}} trains of DB AutoZug. During the summer season approximately 10,000 vehicles are loaded at the Auto Train terminal. Passengers drive themselves over a paved ramp on to a two-story car transport waggon. In the first 25 {{years of the}} motorail terminal in Neu-Isenburg handled 200,000 vehicles. Upon {{the arrival of the}} train, the loaded wagons are attached to the train and passengers board sleeping and <b>couchette</b> <b>cars.</b> Trains run from Neu-Isenburg to Narbonne in France, Alessandria and Verona in Italy and Villach in Austria. A glass-enclosed waiting room is available {{on the south side of}} the station for users of the service.|$|R
50|$|At 22:45 hours {{local time}} on October 20, 1957, two {{passenger}} trains collided head-on on the single railway line at 35 km west of İstanbul Sirkeci Terminal between the railway stations Yarımburgaz and Ispartakule. The east-bound motor train with the train number 3, composed of three {{diesel multiple unit}} (DMU) cars, departed from Edirne railway station at 16:00 hours local time heading for Istanbul. The west-bound train, the Simplon-Orient Express with train number 8, left Istanbul Sirkeci Terminal at 21:50 hours local time heading for Paris, France. It was composed of ten cars consisting of sleeper <b>cars,</b> <b>couchette</b> <b>cars</b> and saloon cars, and was pulled by a 2-8-0 steam locomotive, number 45501 of TCDD 45171 Class.|$|R
5000|$|Economy class also {{exists on}} some sleeper services, most notably on most Russian Railways routes, which designates the class as [...] "Platzkart", with cars {{featuring}} an open 9-bay layout, where each bay has six bunk beds in two tiers — four transversally, and two longitudinally on the opposing {{side of the}} aisle, with the lower bunks functioning as seats in daytime. Several European railways also provide similar [...] "coach class" [...] sleeper <b>cars,</b> commonly dubbed <b>Couchette</b> <b>cars.</b> There is a debate, though, whether Platzkart class is a full tier down from the traditional second class/"coupe", or it's just its cheaper variant, as there used to exist an even cheaper [...] "hard bed" [...] class with three-tier bunks and no bedding, which is long since discontinued in Russia, but is still employed in China.|$|R
