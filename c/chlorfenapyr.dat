5000|$|<b>Chlorfenapyr</b> is a pesticide, and {{specifically}} a pro-insecticide (meaning it is metabolized into an active insecticide after entering the host), {{derived from a}} class of microbially produced compounds known as halogenated pyrroles. The United States Environmental Protection Agency initially denied registration in 2000 for use on cotton primarily because of concerns that the insecticide was toxic to birds and because effective alternatives were available. However, it was registered by EPA in January, 2001 for use on non-food crops in greenhouses. In 2005, EPA established a tolerance for residues of <b>chlorfenapyr</b> in or on all food commodities. <b>Chlorfenapyr</b> works by disrupting the production of adenosine triphosphate, specifically, [...] "Oxidative removal of the N-ethoxymethyl group of <b>chlorfenapyr</b> by mixed function oxidases forms the compound CL 303268.

40|$|Indoor {{spraying}} {{of walls}} and ceilings with residual insecticide remains a primary method of malaria control. Insecticide resistance in malaria vectors {{is a growing}} problem. Novel insecticides for indoor residual spraying (IRS) which can improve the control of pyrethroid resistant malaria vectors are urgently needed.

The efficacy of IRS with <b>chlorfenapyr</b> applied alone or as a mixture with alpha-cypermeththrin (a pyrethroid) was evaluated in experimental huts in Cove, Southern Benin against wild free flying pyrethroid resistant Anopheles gambiae sl. Comparison was made with IRS with alpha-cypermethrin alone. Fortnightly 30 -minute in situ cone bioassays were performed to assess the residual efficacy of the insecticides on the treated hut walls. Survival rates of wild An gambiae from the Cove hut site in WHO resistance bioassays performed during the trial were > 90 % with permethrin and deltamethrin treated papers. Mortality of free-flying mosquitoes entering the experimental huts was 4 % in the control hut. Mortality with alpha-cypermethrin IRS did not differ from the control (5 %, P> 0. 656). The highest mortality was achieved with <b>chlorfenapyr</b> alone (63 %). The alpha-cypermethrin + <b>chlorfenapyr</b> mixture killed fewer mosquitoes than <b>chlorfenapyr</b> alone (43 % vs. 63 %, P< 0. 001).

40|$|Introduction. <b>Chlorfenapyr</b> is {{commonly}} used for food crops in Korea. However, <b>chlorfenapyr</b> toxicity in humans {{has not yet been}} studied. Case. A 74 -year-old man was admitted to the emergency room after he intra-abdominally injected 20 [*]mL of <b>chlorfenapyr</b> in an attempt to commit suicide. Emergency surgery was performed and accumulation of approximately 500 [*]mL of reactive fluid in the abdomen was observed. The entire small intestine showed congestion. After surgery, additional surgery to drain the fluid was performed on POD 12. But immediately after administration of general anesthesia, flat rhythm was observed by electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Discussion. The color of the bowel was purple, indicating ischemic injury. This could be attributed to direct absorption of the substance through the peritoneum, leading to chemical injury to the small intestine serosa, unlike in the case of oral ingestion. This resulted in an ischemic change in the small intestine, eventually leading to sepsis. Conclusion. Only a few cases of <b>chlorfenapyr</b> toxicity {{have been reported in the}} literature, and death occurred in all cases, including our case. Therefore, careful and aggressive treatments are necessary. This is the first reported case of intra-abdominal injection of <b>chlorfenapyr...</b>|$|E

40|$|Complete and {{effective}} elimination of common bed bug (Cimex lectularius) infestations {{continues to be}} a challenge for the pest management industry. However, effective bed bug control can be achieved through integrated pest management (IPM) programs that use a variety of control techniques. An integral component of an IPM program is the type of insecticide applied. However, insecticide products for bed bug control are somewhat limited as resistance to some pyrethroid insecticides, such as deltamethrin has developed. Currently, <b>chlorfenapyr</b> and bifenthrin are two insecticides approved for bed bug control. <b>Chlorfenapyr</b> is a pro-insecticide from the pyrrole class. Bifenthrin is a type-I pyrethroid that can be applied indoors, but it is also available to the general public and therefore {{has the potential to be}} misused for bed bug control. Insecticide resistance is an inevitable consequence of widespread and continuous insecticide application when the proper strategies are not implemented. If bed bugs develop resistance to <b>chlorfenapyr</b> and bifenthrin, it would significantly inhibit the effective management of these notorious pests. Notwithstanding, the susceptibility levels of field bed bug populations to <b>chlorfenapyr</b> and bifenthrin have not been determined on a large scale. Due to the impending threat of insecticide resistance, the primary goal of this research was to screen bed bug populations from across the United States for <b>chlorfenapyr</b> and bifenthrin susceptibility. To screen the field populations, a diagnostic bioassay-based susceptibility monitoring program was developed and implemented. ^ Filter paper and glass vial bioassay methods were compared for different formulations (technical grade and formulated product) of <b>chlorfenapyr</b> and bifenthrin to determine the most suitable assay and formulation for susceptibility monitoring. For each treatment type, lethal concentration (LC 50 and LC 99) estimates were determined with the insecticide-susceptible Harlan strain. Statistical comparison of PROBIT analysis data for bioassay techniques found significant differences in toxicity ratios at the LC 50 and LC 99 levels. Based on the toxicity ratios and bioassay duration, glass vial bioassays using formulated insecticide product appeared more effective for <b>chlorfenapyr</b> and bifenthrin susceptibility monitoring. The glass vial diagnostic LC 99 concentrations for <b>chlorfenapyr</b> and bifenthrin were validated using the Harlan-Susceptible and field-collected (Washington D. C. and Richmond, VA) bed bug populations. Subsequently, eight additional field bed bug populations collected from geographically different regions around the U. S. were screened for <b>chlorfenapyr</b> and bifenthrin susceptibility with the diagnostic glass vial assay. Three of the field collected bed bug populations were resistant to <b>chlorfenapyr</b> when compared to the Harlan susceptible strain. Five of the ten populations had significantly different bifenthrin susceptibilities when compared to the Harlan strain at the LC 99 concentration. These findings demonstrate the need for continuous susceptibility monitoring of bed bug populations to ensure insecticides remain effective. ...|$|E

Hence, there is an urgent need to develop alternative insecticides for effective management of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors. In the present study, <b>chlorfenapyr</b> was evaluated against Anopheles culicifacies and Anopheles stephensi for its possible use in vector control. Methods Efficacy of <b>chlorfenapyr</b> against An. culicifacies and An. stephensi was assessed using adult bioassay tests. In the laboratory, determination of diagnostic dose, assessment of residual activity on different substrates, cross-resistance pattern with different insecticides and potentiation studies using piperonyl butoxide were undertaken by following standard procedures. Potential cross-resistance patterns were assessed on field populations of An. culicifacies. Results A dose of 5. 0 % <b>chlorfenapyr</b> was determined as the diagnostic concentration for assessing susceptibility applying the WHO tube test method in anopheline mosquitoes with 2 h exposure and 48 h holding period. The DDT-resistant/malathion-deltamethrin-susceptible strain of An. culicifacies species C showed higher LD 50 and LD 99 (0. 67 and 2. 39 % respectively) values than the DDT-malathion-deltamethrin susceptible An. culicifacies species A (0. 41 and 2. 0 % respectively) and An. stephensi strains (0. 43 and 2. 13 % respectively) and there was no statistically significant difference in mortalities among the three mosquito species tested (p > 0. 05). Residual activity of <b>chlorfenapyr</b> a. i. of 400 mg/m 2 on five fabricated substrates, namely wood, mud, mud+lime, cement and cement + distemper was found to be effective up to 24 weeks against An. culicifacies and up to 34 weeks against An. stephensi. No cross-resistance to DDT, malathion, bendiocarb and deltamethrin was observed with <b>chlorfenapyr</b> in laboratory-reared strains of An. stephensi and field-caught An. culicifacies.

40|$|Abstract Background Neither indoor {{residual}} spraying (IRS) nor long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) {{are able}} to fully interrupt transmission in holoendemic Africa as single interventions. The combining of IRS and LLINs presents an opportunity for improved control and management of pyrethroid resistance through the simultaneous presentation of unrelated insecticides. Method <b>Chlorfenapyr</b> IRS and a pyrethroid-impregnated polyester LLIN (WHO approved) were tested separately and together in experimental huts in southern Benin against pyrethroid resistant Anopheles gambiae and Culex quinquefasciatus. The bed nets were deliberately holed with either six or 80 holes to {{examine the effect of}} increasing wear and tear on protectiveness. Anopheles gambiae were genotyped for the kdr gene to assess the combination's potential to prevent the selection of pyrethroid resistance. Results The frequency of kdr was 84 %. The overall mortality rates of An. gambiae were 37 % and 49 % with the six-hole and 80 -hole LLINs, respectively, and reached 57 % with <b>chlorfenapyr</b> IRS. Overall mortality rates were significantly higher with the combination treatments (82 - 83 %) than with the LLIN or IRS individual treatments. Blood feeding (mosquito biting) rates were lowest with the 6 -hole LLIN (12 %), intermediate with the 80 -hole LLIN (32 %) and highest with untreated nets (56 % with the 6 -hole and 54 % with the 80 -hole nets). Blood feeding (biting) rates and repellency of mosquitoes with the combination of LLIN and <b>chlorfenapyr</b> IRS showed significant improvement compared to the IRS treatment but did not differ from the LLIN treatments indicating that the LLINs were the primary agents of personal protection. The combination killed significantly higher proportions of Cx. quinquefasciatus (51 %, 41 %) than the LLIN (15 %, 13 %) or IRS (32 %) treatments. Conclusion The <b>chlorfenapyr</b> IRS component was largely responsible for controlling pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes and the LLIN component was largely responsible for blood feeding inhibition and personal protection.

40|$|Objective To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of <b>chlorfenapyr</b> applied on mosquito nets and as an indoor residual spray against populations of Anopheles gambiae and Culex quinquefasciatus {{in an area of}} Benin that shows problematic levels of pyrethroid resistance. Method Eight-week trial conducted in experimental huts. Results Indoor residual spraying killed 82. 9 % of An. gambiae overall (mean mortality: 79. 5 %) compared to 53. 5 % overall (mean mortality: 61. 7 %) in the hut containing the lower dosed ITN. Analysis of data on a fortnightly basis showed high levels of mosquito mortality and blood-feeding inhibition during the first few weeks after treatment. Control of C. quinquefasciatus by the IRS and ITN interventions showed a similar trend to that of An. gambiae and though the average level of mortality was lower it was still much higher than with pyrethroid treatments against this population. Chlorfenapyr's reputation for being rather slow acting was evident particularly at lower dosages. The treatments showed no evidence of excito-repellent activity in this trial. Conclusion <b>Chlorfenapyr</b> has the potential to control pyrethroid resistant populations of A. gambiae. There is a need to develop long-lasting formulations of <b>chlorfenapyr</b> to prolong its residual life on nets and sprayed surfaces. On nets it could be combined with a contact irritant pyrethroid to give improved protection against mosquito biting while killing pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes that come into contact with the ne...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Laboratory {{studies were}} {{conducted}} during the year 2010 to evaluate the duration of residual toxicity of the acaricides; abamectin, milbemectin and <b>chlorfenapyr</b> to six populations of the two spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae Koch, (Acari: Tetranychidae) collected from cucumber grown under plastic houses in the six main cultivated areas in Jordan (Ramta, Baqa', Zyzya, Krimeh, Dier Alla and Karamah), compared to a Syrian susceptible strain. Loss of susceptibility in the six populations to the closely related acaricides abamectin and milbemectin were clearly indicated even after one day of application, where the mortality did not exceed 24 and 33 %, compared to 96 and 97 % for Syrian susceptible strain for the two acaricides, respectively. In contrast, mortality from residual toxicity of <b>chlorfenapyr</b> were considered efficacious after one day of application and reached acceptable level even after 15 days of application. The mortality was ranged between 92 - 98 % after one day of application and 48 - 68 % after 15 days of application, in four out of six populations. The mite populations collected from Karamah and Krimeh were the least susceptible. Mortality from residual toxicity after one day of application were 75 and 88 %, respectively, compared to 98 % mortality in the Syrian susceptible strain.

The effects of beta-cypermethrin, <b>chlorfenapyr,</b> chlorpyrifos, spinosad, etofenprox, triflumuron, alpha-cypermethrin/teflubenzuron, and lambda-cyhalothrin/thiamethoxam on Trichogramma pretiosum Riley, 1879 (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) immature stages were evaluated. Eggs of Anagasta kuehniella (Zeller, 1879) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), containing immature stages of the parasitoid were dipped in water solution pesticides, to evaluate their effects on emergence and sex ratio of F 1 parasitoids. For F 2 parasitoids, emergence, parasitism capacity, and sex ratio were evaluated. Beta-cypermethrin, <b>chlorfenapyr,</b> chlorpyrifos, and spinosad affected the emergence success of F 1 T. pretiosum. Insects exposed to etofenprox and alpha-cypermethrin/teflubenzuron during the egg-larval period and to lambda-cyhalothrin/thiamethoxam during the pupal stage also suffered reduction in the emergence. Beta-cypermethrin affected the sex ratio of F 1 T. pretiosum from host eggs treated during the egg-larval period; spinosad affected it during the egg-larval period and the pupal stage, whereas chlorpyrifos did the same when applied during the pupal stage. Chlorpyrifos also affected the sex ratio of F 2 parasitoids, but only when applied during the egg-larval period, whereas <b>chlorfenapyr</b> reduced this trait when applied during the pre-pupal phase. Chlorpyrifos and alpha-cypermethrin/teflubenzuron affected the parasitism capacity of F 1 females from eggs treated during the egg-larval period.

40|$|A {{bioassay}} {{technique was}} developed to test the efficacy of insecticides against potato moth (Phthorimaea operculella (Zeller)) on tomatoes. The technique tested efficacy against both larvae in mines and neonate larvae {{that had not yet}} penetrated the leaf, and explained the failure of some insecticides to control P. operculella infestations in commercial tomato crops. Neonate larvae placed on leaves of potted plants several days before treatment provided larvae for testing of insecticides against larvae in mines; other neonates were placed on leaves after treatment to test efficacy against larvae yet to penetrate the leaf. The plants were sprayed with the candidate insecticides, held for 5 - 7 days, and larval mortality assessed. <b>Chlorfenapyr</b> (100, 200 g a. i. ha- 1) and abamectin (8. 1 g a. i. ha- 1) were effective against neonate larvae and larvae in mines. Sulprofos (720 g a. i. ha - 1), methomyl (450 g a. i. ha- 1) and spinosad (96 g a. i. ha- 1) were effective against neonate larvae but not against larvae in mines. Methamidophos (1102 g a. i. ha- 1), endosulfan (700 g a. i. ha- 1) and Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki (1000 g ha- 1) had some effect against exposed larvae but little against larvae in mines.

40|$|Pyrethroid {{resistant}} Anopheles gambiae malaria vectors are widespread throughout sub-Saharan Africa {{and continued}} efficacy of pyrethroid ITNs is under threat. <b>Chlorfenapyr</b> is a promising pyrrole insecticide {{with a unique}} mechanism of action conferring no cross-resistance to existing public health insecticides. Mixtures of <b>chlorfenapyr</b> (CFP) and alphacypermethrin (alpha) may provide additional benefits over <b>chlorfenapyr</b> or alphacypermethrin used alone. An ITN mixture of CFP 100 mg/m 2 +alpha 25 mg/m 2 was compared with CFP 100 mg/m 2 and alpha 25 mg/m 2 in a small-scale experimental hut trial {{in an area of}} wild An. arabiensis. The same treatments were evaluated in tunnel tests against insectary-reared pyrethroid susceptible and resistant Culex quinquefasciatus. Performance was measured in terms of insecticide-induced mortality, and blood-feeding inhibition. Tunnel tests showed that mixtures of CFP 100 + alpha 25 were 1. 2 and 1. 5 times more effective at killing susceptible Cx. quinquefasciatus than either Alpha 25 (P = 0. 001) or CFP 100 (P = 0. 001) ITNs. Mixtures of CFP 100 + alpha 25 were 2. 2 and 1. 2 times more effective against resistant Cx. quinquefasciatus than either alpha 25 (P = 0. 001) or CFP 100 (P = 0. 003) ITNs. CFP 100 + alpha 25 produced higher levels of blood-feeding inhibition than CFP alone for susceptible (94 vs 46 %, P = 0. 001) and resistant (84 vs 53 %, P = 0. 001) strains. In experimental huts the mixture of CFP 100 + Alpha 25 killed 58 % of An. arabiensis, compared with 50 % for alpha and 49 % for CFP, though the differences were not significant.

40|$|Malaria control {{through use of}} {{long-lasting}} insecticidal nets (LN) {{is threatened}} by the selection of anopheline mosquitoes strongly resistant to pyrethroid insecticides. To sustain future effectiveness {{it is essential to}} identify and evaluate novel insecticides suitable for nets. Mixtures of two insecticides with contrasting mode of action have the potential to kill resistant vectors and restore transmission control provided the formulation can withstand regular washing over the net’s life span. METHOD: The efficacy of a novel mixture LN, Interceptor® G 2, that combines the pyrrole <b>chlorfenapyr</b> and pyrethroid alpha-cypermethrin was evaluated under controlled household conditions (experimental hut trial) and by laboratory bioassay against pyrethroid resistant An. gambiae in Benin before and after standardized washing. Comparison arms included standard alpha-cypermethrin LN, nets hand-treated with chlorfenapyr-only and untreated nets. RESULTS: The chlorfenapyr-alphacypermethrin LN demonstrated improved efficacy and wash resistance compared to a standard alpha-cypermethrin LN against pyrethroid resistant mosquitoes (resistance ratio 207). In experimental hut trial alpha-cypermethrin LN killed only 20 % (95 % CI 15 – 26 %) of host-seeking An. gambiae whilst mixture LN killed 71 % (95 % CI 65 – 77 %). Mixture LN washed 20 times killed 65 % (95 % CI 58 – 71 %), and thus intensive washing reduced efficacy by only 6 % (95 % CI 1. 3 – 11 %). The <b>chlorfenapyr</b> net killed 76 % (95 % CI 70 – 81 %). Personal protection and blood feeding inhibition did not differ between mixture and pyrethroid LN; however, the mixture LN was 2. 5 (95 % CI: 2. 1 – 3. 1) times more protective than untreated nets. Standard WHO cone bioassays conducted during day time hours failed to anticipate field efficacy but overnight tunnel tests successfully predicted mixture LN and <b>chlorfenapyr</b> net efficacy in field trials. CONCLUSION: Interceptor® G 2 LN demonstrates the potential to control transmission and provide community protection over the normal lifespan of long lasting nets where standard pyrethroid LN show signs of failing due to resistance...|$|E
