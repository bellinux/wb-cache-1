50|$|The USSR was {{relatively}} ineffective {{in its use}} of naval mines in WWII in comparison with its record in previous wars. Small mines were developed for use in rivers and lakes, and special mines for shallow water. A very large <b>chemical</b> <b>mine</b> was designed to sink through ice {{with the aid of}} a melting compound. Special aerial mine designs finally arrived in 1943-1944, the AMD-500 and AMD-1000. Various Soviet Naval Aviation torpedo bombers were pressed into the role of aerial mining in the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea, including Ilyushin DB-3s, Il-4s and Lend Lease Douglas Boston IIIs.|$|E

40|$|Mining {{chemical}} compounds in silico has drawn increasing attention from both academia and pharmaceutical industry {{due to its}} effectiveness in aiding the drug discovery process. Since graphs are the natural representation for {{chemical compounds}}, most of the mining algorithms focus on <b>mining</b> <b>chemical</b> graphs. <b>Chemical</b> graph <b>mining</b> approaches have many applications in the drug discovery process that include structure-activity-relationship (SAR) model construction and bioactivity classification, similar compound search and retrieval from chemical compound database, target identification from phenotypic assays, etc. Solving such problems in silico through studying and <b>mining</b> <b>chemical</b> graphs can provide novel perspective to medicinal chemists, biologist and toxicologist. Moreover, since the large scale <b>chemical</b> graph <b>mining</b> is usually employed at {{the early stages of}} drug discovery, {{it has the potential to}} speed up the entire drug discovery process. In this chapter, we discuss various problems and algorithms related to <b>mining</b> <b>chemical</b> graphs and describe some of the state-of-the-art <b>chemical</b> graph <b>mining</b> methodologies and their applications. ...|$|R

40|$|At {{the end of}} 2006 {{the project}} of pilot {{experiment}} of immobilization of contaminants in-situ was prepared in DIAMO, s. p., o. z. TUU. Realisation of the experiment is planned for years 2007 and 2008. The principle of immobilization of contaminants in-situ is to develop special conditions in water bearing sandstone sediments when transformation of contaminants from mobile form to immobile form can happen. Under the conditions of remediation after <b>chemical</b> <b>mining</b> (using sulphuric acid) of uranium on the deposit Straz it means injecting suitable alkaline medium and its spreading in contaminated sandstone aquifer. It will lead to decreasing of acidity of contaminated groundwater and precipitating of contaminants (SO 42 -, Al, Fe) in pores. This process is followed by co-precipitation and sorption of other toxic contaminants as As and Be. The results of the pilot experiment {{will be used for}} design of application of method of immobilization in-situ in the frame of remediation after <b>chemical</b> <b>mining</b> of uranium on the deposit Straz with the aim to decrease time and costs of the whole remediation process...|$|R
