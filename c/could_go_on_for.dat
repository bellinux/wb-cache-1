5|$|The {{trial began}} in January 2005; the judge, Mr Justice Mackay, warned that it <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> a year. On 14 July, the judge {{instructed}} {{the jury to}} acquit all defendants on charges of manslaughter. A few days later, Balfour Beatty changed its plea to guilty on {{the health and safety}} charges and, on 6 September, Network Rail was found guilty of breaching health and safety law. Network Rail were fined £3.5 million while Balfour Beatty were fined £10 million. All of the manslaughter charges against the executives were dismissed by the judge.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the first}} {{recorded}} rituals we know of is Niiname-sai, the ceremony in which the Emperor offers newly harvested rice to the kami to secure their blessing for a bountiful harvest. A yearly festival, Niiname-sai is also performed when a new Emperor comes to power, in which case it is called Onamesai. In the ceremony the Emperor offers crops from the new harvest to the kami, including rice, fish, fruits, soup, and stew. The Emperor first feasts with the deities, then the guests. The feast <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> some time; for example, the Showa Emperor's feast spanned two days.|$|E
25|$|Unlike Olympic wrestling, oil wrestling matches may be won by {{achieving}} {{an effective}} {{hold of the}} kisbet. Thus, the pehalvan aims to control his opponent by putting his arm through the latter's kisbet. To win by this move is called paça kazık. Originally, matches had no set duration and <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> one or two days, until one man was able to establish superiority, but in 1975 the duration was capped at 40 minutes for the baspehlivan and 30 minutes for the pehlivan category. If no winner is determined, another 15 minutes—10 minutes for the pehlivan category—of wrestling ensues, wherein scores are kept to determine the victor.|$|E

500|$|The {{gift for}} vivid characterisation, which Mitford {{developed}} in her fiction, {{was used to}} full effect in her four biographical works. In the first of these, Madame de Pompadour, she followed Waugh's advice not to write for experts but to fashion [...] "a popular life like Strachey's Queen Victoria", with [...] "plenty of period prettiness". This remained her yardstick in her subsequent biographical writings. Her own description of Voltaire in Love is [...] "a Kinsey report of his romps with Mme de Châtelet and her romps with Saint-Lambert and his romps with Mme de Boufflers... I <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> pages". Acton thought The Sun King the most entertaining introduction to the subject in the English language. Mitford's informal style was remarked on by the literary critic Cyril Connolly, who wrote that her facility for transforming unpromising source material into readable form was a skill that any professional historian might envy. The historian Antonia Fraser considered Mitford an important contributor to the [...] "remorseless process by which historical and biographical sales have soared since 1950".|$|E
500|$|As {{mentioned}} above, repetition was {{a natural}} part of Tchaikovsky's music, just as it {{is an integral part of}} Russian music. His use of sequences within melodies (repeating a tune at a higher or lower pitch in the same voice) <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> extreme length. The problem with repetition is that, over a period of time, the melody being repeated remains static, even when there is a surface level of rhythmic activity added to it. Tchaikovsky kept the musical conversation flowing by treating melody, tonality, rhythm and sound color as one integrated unit, rather than as separate elements. By making subtle but noticeable changes in the rhythm or phrasing of a tune, modulating to another key, changing the melody itself or varying the instruments playing it, Tchaikovsky could keep a listener's interest from flagging. By extending the number of repetitions, he could increase the musical and dramatic tension of a passage, building [...] "into an emotional experience of almost unbearable intensity," [...] as Brown phrases it, controlling when the peak and release of that tension would take place. Musicologist Martin Cooper calls this practice a subtle form of unifying a piece of music and adds that Tchaikovsky brought it to a high point of refinement. (For more on this practice, see the next section.) ...|$|E
