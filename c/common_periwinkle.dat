5|$|The Eurasian {{rock pipit}} {{is also a}} host to the flea Ceratophyllus borealis, and several other flea species in the genera Ceratophyllus and Dasypsyllus. The Eurasian rock pipit can benefit from {{parasitism}} of the <b>common</b> <b>periwinkle</b> Littorina littoria by the castrating trematode Parorchis acanthus. Beaches can become attractive where {{the decline of the}} periwinkle results in more ungrazed algae, with corresponding increases in invertebrates and a greater diversity of smaller Littorina snails as food for the pipits.|$|E
500|$|The {{marine waters}} around the {{province}} are considered boreal, or sub-Arctic, in nature. [...] A {{great deal of}} the coastline is rock-strewn, allowing an extensive variety of plant and animal life to thrive. The leading plants of the shoreline are the large brown seaweeds, such as bladder, forked and knotted Wracks, and winged and sugar kelps, though there are also a number of red and green seaweeds present. Common animals of the seashore region include barnacles, [...] tortoiseshell limpet, <b>common</b> <b>periwinkle,</b> blue mussels, sea anemones, sea slugs, sea urchins, starfish, and rock crabs. The deeper waters are home to a variety of fish, such as Atlantic cod, sculpins and cunners, halibut, haddock, sharks, and marine mammals, such as dolphins, porpoises, and whales. Whales seen off Newfoundland include Pilot whales, minkes, sei whales, fin whales and humpbacks. Harp and hooded seals are usually found in the spring, giving birth to their young on coastal ice floes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{intertidal}} zone of rocky shores can contain indentations which trap pools of salty water, called rock pools. Living in these habitats are communities of hardy {{plant and animal}} species specially adapted for coping with the volatile environment around them. The plants and animals interact {{with each other and with}} the rock pool to form miniature ecosystems, easily accessible to students and a source of fascination for young children. Plants such as seaweeds, cnidarians such as sea anemones, arthropods like barnacles, and molluscs such as the common limpet and the <b>common</b> <b>periwinkle</b> can be permanent residents of rock pools. But most rock pool animals, such as [...] crabs, shrimp and fish are just temporary residents, occupying a rock pool only until the next tide takes them to a new location.|$|E

25|$|The island's only {{permanent}} macro-organism inhabitants are <b>common</b> <b>periwinkles</b> {{and other}} marine molluscs. Small numbers of seabirds, mainly fulmars, northern gannets, black-legged kittiwakes, and common guillemots, use the rock for resting in summer, and gannets and guillemots occasionally breed successfully if the summer is calm with no storm waves washing over the rock. In total {{there have been}} just over twenty species of seabird and six other animal species observed (including the aforementioned molluscs) {{on or near the}} islet.|$|R
50|$|<b>Common</b> <b>periwinkles</b> {{have been}} {{introduced}} to the Atlantic coast of North America, possibly by rock ballast in the mid-19th century. This species is also found {{on the west coast}} of the United States, from Washington to California. The first recorded sighting in the East was in 1840 in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. It is now abundant on rocky shores from New Jersey northward to Newfoundland. In Canada, its range includes New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador.|$|R
50|$|Austrocochlea constricta, {{common names}} the {{southern}} periwinkle, <b>common</b> <b>periwinkle,</b> or ribbon monodonta, is {{a species of}} sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Trochidae, the top snails.|$|E

5000|$|Foreness Point {{is a low}} {{headland}} on {{the coast}} of Kent in England. It extends a short distance into the entrance of the Thames Estuary, on the north coast of Thanet, between Palm Bay in Cliftonville and Botany Bay in Broadstairs. Off the point there is a reef, exposed at low tide, known as Long Nose Spit, where <b>common</b> <b>periwinkles</b> are collected by the public as a food item. [...] There is a water treatment plant on the headland.|$|R
5000|$|This {{family is}} a lineage {{closely related to the}} Littorinidae (<b>periwinkles)</b> <b>common</b> in coastal habitat. They have adapted to {{terrestrial}} life and are thus sometimes called [...] "land winkles".|$|R
5000|$|This {{species is}} ectoparasitic (an {{external}} parasite) on various bivalves and other gastropods. It is notorious as a pest on oyster beds. Its preferred hosts are the <b>common</b> <b>periwinkle</b> Littorina littorea, the mud snail Tritia obsoleta {{and the eastern}} oyster Crassostrea virginica ...|$|E
50|$|Raising the <b>common</b> <b>periwinkle</b> has {{not been}} a focus due to its {{abundance}} in nature and relatively low price, however there are potential benefits from aquaculturing this species, including a more controlled environment, easier harvesting, less damages from predators, as well as saving the natural population from commercial harvesting.|$|E
50|$|Toxicity for {{molluscs}} varies widely, with 48-hour LD50 {{found between}} 5 mg/l {{for the common}} limpet and 100 mg/l for the <b>common</b> <b>periwinkle.</b> Various species of phytoplankton have an LD50 around 8 mg/l. All of these doses refer to a particular formulation (mentioned in the reference), not the pure chemical.|$|E
5000|$|Vinca herbacea, with <b>common</b> name {{herbaceous}} <b>periwinkle,</b> is a {{flowering plant}} native to eastern and southeastern Europe, from Austria south to Greece, and {{east to the}} Crimea, and also in northern Western Asia, in the Caucasus and Alborz mountains.|$|R
50|$|Industrial fishing {{also makes}} an {{important}} contribution to the economy of the region and small-scale artisanal fisheries provide a living for thousands of Angolans and South Africans. In Namibia, more than 20 species are fished commercially and approximately 90% of the catch is exported. The fishing industry employs 13,700 people (2003 figures). There are very few small-scale/artisanal fishers in Namibia, but recreational fishing is a popular sport and a major attraction for coastal tourists. In Angola, at least 25,000 coastal people work as artisanal fishers, while an estimated 80,000 people - mostly women - prepare and sell the artisanal catch and are therefore dependent on fishing for their livelihoods. The South African fishing industry is very diverse. The country’s fishing fleet ranges in size from small rock lobster dinghies, to highly sophisticated freezer trawlers. The small pelagic fishery for sardine and anchovy is the largest fishery by volume, while the deep-sea trawling industry is the largest by value. This fishery targets the Cape hakes. Artisanal fishers operate along the entire South African coast, harvesting a wide variety of species including linefish, mussels, oysters, ascidians and <b>common</b> <b>periwinkles.</b> Various species of seaweed form the basis of a small industry that produces alginate products and feed for aquaculture operations.|$|R
50|$|Vinca major, {{with the}} <b>common</b> names bigleaf <b>{{periwinkle}},</b> large periwinkle, greater periwinkle and blue periwinkle, is species of flowering {{plant in the}} family Apocynaceae, native to the western Mediterranean. Growing to 25 cm tall and spreading indefinitely, it is an evergreen perennial, frequently used in cultivation as groundcover.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Common</b> <b>Periwinkle</b> is sold by fishmongers at seafood {{markets in}} large cities around the world, and is also {{commonly}} found in seafood restaurants as an appetizer or {{as a part of}} a seafood platter.

5000|$|Parorchis acanthusi is a {{parasitic}} flatworm of {{the class}} Trematoda. It is a parasitic castrator of the <b>common</b> <b>periwinkle</b> Littorina littoria. The resulting decline {{in the numbers of}} that mollusc can lead to more ungrazed algae, with corresponding increases in invertebrate populations and a greater diversity of smaller Littorina snails. The increased numbers of small prey items makes the affected rocky coasts more attractive to birds such as the purple sandpiper and Eurasian rock pipit.|$|E

50|$|Polydora ciliata {{has also}} been found to {{excavate}} burrows in the shell of the <b>common</b> <b>periwinkle</b> when the snail is mature (above 10 mm long). The reason why this only happens to mature snails are not yet known, but one hypothesis is that a mature snail will excrete a signal substance which attracts the Polydora ciliata larvae, while another hypothesis is that a mature snail has {{a change in the}} shell surface, which makes it suitable for Polydora ciliata larvae to settle. The infection by this parasite does not seem to alter the growth and proportions of the snail shell.|$|E

50|$|Non native macroinvertebrates {{can find}} their way into a ballast tank. This can cause {{problems}} ecologically and economically. Macro-invertebrates are transported by transoceanic and coastal vessels arriving in ports all over the world. Researchers from Switzerland sampled 67 ballast tanks from 62 different vessels operating along geographic pathways and tested for mid ocean exchange or voyage length that had a high chance of macro-invertebrate relocating to {{a different part of the}} world. An assessment was done between the relationship of macro-invertebrate presence, and the amount of sediment in ballast tanks. The Switzerland researchers had discovered a presence of a highly invasive European green crab, mud crab, <b>common</b> <b>periwinkle,</b> soft shell clam, and blue mussel in the ballast tanks of the sampled ships. Although the densities of macro-invertebrate were low, invasion of non-native macro-invertebrates can be worrisome during their mating season. The worst thing that can happen is if a female macro-invertebrate is carrying millions of eggs per animal.|$|E

50|$|The park {{contains}} {{thousands of}} {{species in the}} life domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. There may be over 200 fungus species in the park, including artist's fungus, black locust shelf fungus, hedge-hog fungus, hen-of-the-woods, pear-shaped puffball, and turkey-tail fungus. Its trees include ashleaf maples, American beeches, American elms, black haws, cottonwoods, eastern redbuds, eastern sycamores, princesstrees, spicebushes, trees-of-heaven, tuliptrees, and white oaks. Its spring ephemerals include spring-beauties and cutleaf toothworts. Other wildflowers in the park are asters, elephant's-foot, wingstem, and yellow jewelweed. Two native plant species that are evidently now extinct in the park are round-lobed hepatica and trailing arbutus. Both ground and climbing forms of poison-ivy are common in Glover Archbold Park. In about 2000, highly pestiferous Asian tiger mosquitoes {{first appeared in the}} park. In 2004, adult 17-year cicadas were common there. A rare harvester butterfly was seen in the park. Some of its other insects are black swallowtails, Chinese mantids, eastern carpenter bees, eastern-tailed blues, eastern tiger swallowtails, Andrena erigeniae bees, false honey ants, impatient bumblebees, imperial moths, monarchs, Peck's skippers, Pennsylvania soldier beetles, sachem skippers, silver-spotted skippers, spicebush swallowtails, spring azures, summer azures, western honey bees, and zebra swallowtails. The park has a significant invasion of nonnative plants, including Asiatic bittersweet, bamboo, <b>common</b> <b>periwinkle,</b> English ivy, garlic-mustard, gill-over-the-ground, Japanese honeysuckle, lesser celandine, wild-garlic, and wintercreeper. Once a 2-foot tall, nonnative, tropical papaya seedling grew in the stream bed. Because people have altered the park's landscape so much, native fish are no longer in the stream. Eastern box turtles, frogs, and toads are rare or extinct in the park, not to mention American black bears, American elk, bison, and timber wolves which once lived in the Washington, D.C. area. Its birds include American robins, barred owls, blue jays, Carolina wrens, catbirds, common crows, fish crows, northern cardinals, northern mockingbirds, and wood thrushes. Mammals in the park include common raccoons, coyotes, domestic cats, domestic dogs, gray foxes, humans, short-tailed shrews, Virginia opossums, white-footed mice, and white-tailed deer.|$|E
