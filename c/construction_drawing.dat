5000|$|The Lingiliformea brachiopods have apatite shells, which {{contrasts}} with the calcitic exoskeleta {{of the other two}} brachiopod subphyla. This split occurred very early - the earliest brachiopod assemblages, from the Tommotian, already contain both apatite- and calcite-secreting organisms. [...] Since the minerals used to form exoskeleta rarely change, [...] one might expect these two forms to represent two discrete lineages - but in fact, early brachiopods used a wide range of techniques and materials in shell <b>construction,</b> <b>drawing</b> from phosphatic, calcitic and organic building blocks, and sometimes employing all three. [...] Deducing the original method of mineralisation is tricky; however, it appears that the tommotiids - probably the closest stem group to the brachiopoda, assuming that the Brachiopod Fold Hypothesis is false - produced the same shell microstructre as the earliest known brachiopods. Their shells had a relatively high concentration of phosphate and organic material, though this decreased over time.|$|E
5000|$|The transferable-lettering-sheet company, Letraset {{made several}} {{variants}} {{available in the}} 1970s. Also the Berthold type foundry adopted the DIN typefaces for their optomechanical phototype setting systems such as Staromat. In 1980 the DIN typefaces were redrawn by Adolf Gropp (1911-1996), a lettering artist from Frankfurt. The drawings were made on a finer grid. This enabled an exact definition of details such {{as the amount of}} overshoot of round characters (e.g. C, G and O) below the baseline and above the cap height. Also characters such as S for which an accurate <b>construction</b> <b>drawing</b> had never been made were now defined using lines and arcs for the new cutting plotters that were to be used for the lettering on motorway signage.
