5000|$|Jolly Blackburn {{majored in}} anthropology, history, and {{classical}} cultures in college. Blackburn later joined the Army, and launched both the gaming magazine Shadis and his <b>company</b> Alderac Entertainment <b>Group</b> (<b>named</b> after his AD&D campaign world) {{while still in}} the Army. The original Shadis was a black-and-white digest featured gaming articles largely written by Blackburn, and each issue featured several pieces of fiction collectively called the [...] "Alderac Anthonology" [...] which detailed Blackburn's world of Alderac (one of Alderac's moons was Shadis, from which the magazine borrowed its name). He conceived of having a comic strip that became Knights of the Dinner Table (KoDT) in 1990 as part of Shadis: [...] "I had been a great fan of J.D. Webster's Finieous Fingers from the early Dragon Magazine, and I wanted something similar. Unfortunately, I couldn't find anyone willing to do a strip. Finally I sat down and drew out a very crude cartoon showing a gamemaster and a player sitting around a table arguing over a rules call." [...] Blackburn based the KoDT characters on friends and fellow players, and B.A. Felton on himself. Blackburn conceived the cartoon as just filler material, but when he replaced it with more professional strips in one issue of Shadis there was an outcry from fans.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Many patients' and consumers' {{organizations}} accept {{drug industry}} funding {{to support their}} activities. As drug <b>companies</b> and patient <b>groups</b> move closer, disclosure become essential for transparency, and the internet could be a useful means of making sponsorship information accessible to the public. This survey aims to assess the transparency of {{a large group of}} Italian patient and consumer groups and a <b>group</b> of pharmaceutical <b>companies,</b> focusing on their websites. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Patient and consumer groups were selected from those stated to be sponsored by a <b>group</b> of pharmaceutical <b>companies</b> on their websites. The websites were examined using two forms with principal (name of drug companies providing funds, amount of funding) and secondary indicators of transparency (section where sponsors are disclosed, update of sponsorship). Principal indicators were applied independently by two reviewers to the patient and consumer groups' websites. Discordances were solved by discussion. One hundred fifty-seven Italian patient and consumer groups and 17 drug companies were considered. Thirteen drug companies (76 %) named at least one group funded, on their Italian websites. Of these, four (31 %) indicated the activities sponsored and two (15 %) the amount of funding. Of the 157 patient and consumer groups, 46 (29 %) named at least one pharmaceutical company as providing funds. Three (6 %) reported the amount of funding, 25 (54 %) the activities funded, none the proportion of income derived from drug <b>companies.</b> Among the <b>groups</b> <b>naming</b> pharmaceutical <b>company</b> sponsors, 15 (33 %) declared them in a dedicated section, five (11 %) on the home page, the others in the financial report or other sections. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Disclosure of funds is scarce on Italian patient and consumer groups' websites. The levels of transparency need to be improved. Disclosure of patient and consumer groups provided with funds is frequent on Italian pharmaceutical companies' websites, but information are often not complete...|$|R
