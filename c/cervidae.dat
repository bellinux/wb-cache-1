5|$|Members of {{the genus}} Cervus (and hence early {{relatives}} or possible ancestors of the elk) first appear in the fossil record 25 million years ago, during the Oligocene in Eurasia, but do {{not appear in the}} North American fossil record until the early Miocene. The extinct Irish elk (Megaloceros) was not a member {{of the genus}} Cervus, but rather the largest member of the wider deer family (<b>Cervidae)</b> known from the fossil record.|$|E
5|$|The valley {{also has}} {{a wide variety of}} small mammals with larger species {{including}} Eurasian badger (Meles meles) and deer (<b>Cervidae).</b> The valley is home to fifteen of the sixteen bats found in England including a roost, at Compton Martin Ochre Mine, for greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum). A rare and endangered species, the greater horseshoe bat is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and is listed in Annex II of the 1992 European Community Habitats Directive.|$|E
25|$|The {{red blood}} cells of mammals are {{typically}} shaped as biconcave disks: flattened and depressed in the center, with a dumbbell-shaped cross section, and a torus-shaped rim {{on the edge of}} the disk. This distinctive biconcave shape optimises the flow properties of blood in the large vessels, such as maximization of laminar flow and minimization of platelet scatter, which suppresses their atherogenic activity in those large vessels. However, there are some exceptions concerning shape in the artiodactyl order (even-toed ungulates including cattle, deer, and their relatives), which displays a wide variety of bizarre red blood cell morphologies: small and highly ovaloid cells in llamas and camels (family Camelidae), tiny spherical cells in mouse deer (family Tragulidae), and cells which assume fusiform, lanceolate, crescentic, and irregularly polygonal and other angular forms in red deer and wapiti (family <b>Cervidae).</b> Members of this order have clearly evolved a mode of red blood cell development substantially different from the mammalian norm. Overall, mammalian {{red blood cells}} are remarkably flexible and deformable so as to squeeze through tiny capillaries, as well as to maximize their apposing surface by assuming a cigar shape, where they efficiently release their oxygen load.|$|E
500|$|The genus Pudu {{was first}} erected by English naturalist John Edward Gray in 1850. Pudua was a Latinized {{version of the}} name {{proposed}} by Alfred Henry Garrod in 1877, but was ruled invalid. Pudús are classified in the New World deer subfamily Capreolinae within the deer family <b>Cervidae.</b> The term [...] "pudú" [...] itself {{is derived from the}} Mapuche people of southern Chile. Because they live on the slopes of the Andes Mountain Range, they are also known as the [...] "Chilean mountain goat".|$|E
500|$|The elk, or wapiti (Cervus canadensis), {{is one of}} {{the largest}} species within the deer family, <b>Cervidae,</b> in the world, and one of the largest land mammals in North America and Eastern Asia. This animal should not be {{confused}} with the still larger moose (Alces alces) to which the name [...] "elk" [...] applies in British English and in reference to populations in Eurasia. Apart from the moose, the only other member of the deer family to rival the elk in size is the south Asian sambar (Rusa unicolor).|$|E
2500|$|The chital is {{the sole}} member of the genus Axis and is {{classified}} under the family <b>Cervidae</b> (deer). The species was first described by German naturalist Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben in 1777. Earlier, Hyelaphus – comprising the Bawean deer (H. kuhli), the Calamian deer (H. calamianensis [...] ) and the hog deer (H. porcinus) – was considered a subgenus of Axis. However Hyelaphus has now been elevated to generic status a 2004 phylogenetic study showed that Hyelaphus {{is closer to the}} genus Rusa than Axis. The study showed that Axis is paraphyletic, and distant from Hyelaphus in the phylogenetic tree. The chital forms a clade with Rucervus duvaucelii (barasinga) and R. schomburgki (Schomburgk's deer). The chital diverged from the Rucervus lineage in the early Pliocene (five million years ago). A 2002 study shows that Axis shansius, followed by A. lyra, is the earliest ancestor in the A. axis lineage. Axis is no longer considered a subgenus of Cervus.|$|E
60|$|Again, all {{the great}} groups of the Ruminants, the Bovidae, Antilopidae, Camelopardalidae, and <b>Cervidae,</b> are {{represented}} in the Miocene epoch, {{and so are the}} Camels. The Upper Eocene Anoplotherium, which is intercalary between the Pigs and the Tragulidae, has only two or, at most, three toes. Among the scanty mammals of the Lower Eocene formation we have the perissodactyle Ungulata represented by Coryphodon, Hyra-cotherium, and Pliolophus. Suppose for a moment, for the sake of following out the argument, that Pliolophus represents the primary stock of the Perissodactyles, and Dichobune that of the Artiodactyles (though I am far from saying that such is the case), then we find, in the earliest fauna of the Eocene epoch to which our investigations carry us, the two divisions of the Ungulata completely differentiated, and no trace of any common stock of both, or of five-toed predecessors to either. With the case of the Horses before us, justifying a belief in the production of new animal forms by modification of old ones, I see no escape from the necessity of seeking for these ancestors of the Ungulata beyond the limits of the Tertiary formations.|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{the middle}} {{stage of the}} Miocene the cervine antler {{consists}} [...] merely of a simple forked crown (as in Cervus dicroceros), which [...] increases in size in the Upper Miocene, although it still [...] remains small and erect, {{like that of the}} roe. In Cervus [...] Matheroni it measures 11·4 inches, and throws off not more than [...] four tines, all small. The deer living in Auvergne in the [...] succeeding or Pliocene age, present us with another stage in the [...] history of antler development. There, for the first time, we see [...] antlers of the Axis and Rusa type, larger and longer, and more [...] branching than any antlers were before, and possessing three or [...] more well-developed tines. Deer of this type abounded in [...] Pliocene Europe. They belong to the Oriental division of the [...] <b>Cervidae,</b> and their presence in Europe confirms the evidence of [...] the flora, brought forward by the Comte de Saporta, that the [...] Pliocene climate was warm. They have probably disappeared from [...] Europe in consequence of the lowering of the temperature in the [...] Pleistocene age, while their descendants have found a congenial [...] home in the warmer regions of Eastern Asia.|$|E

50|$|Until the {{beginning}} of the 21st century it was understood that the family Moschidae (musk deer) is sister to <b>Cervidae.</b> However, a 2003 phylogenetic study by Alexandre Hassanin (of National Museum of Natural History, France) and colleagues, based on mitochondrial and nuclear analyses, revealed that Moschidae and Bovidae form a clade sister to <b>Cervidae.</b> According to the study, <b>Cervidae</b> diverged from the Bovidae-Moschidae clade 27 to 28 million years ago. A similar study in 2013 echoed the findings of this study. The following cladogram is based on the 2003 study.|$|E
