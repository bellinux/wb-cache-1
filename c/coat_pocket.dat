5|$|It was {{designed}} to be carried in a <b>coat</b> <b>pocket</b> or kept on a night-stand, and many have survived to the present day in good condition, having seen little actual use. Numerous copies of this design were made during the late 19th century in Belgium, with smaller numbers also produced in Spain, France and the USA. They remained reasonably popular until the Second World War, but are now generally sought after only as collectors' pieces, since ammunition for them is for the most part no longer commercially manufactured.|$|E
5|$|The episode ends when Stanley (Leslie David Baker) {{attempts}} to get a cookie from a blood drive nurse at the drive by claiming he gave blood earlier and showing a cotton ball taped to his arm as proof. The nurse recognizes he is lying because they are using band-aids; a frustrated Stanley leaves, and tells Phyllis, {{who is about to}} try the same trick. In the final scene, Creed (Creed Bratton) is seen leaving the blood mobile with a bag of donated blood in his <b>coat</b> <b>pocket.</b>|$|E

5|$|As Scully {{heads to}} the other room to get ready, her FBI badge falls out of her <b>coat</b> <b>pocket.</b> Scully discreetly picks it back up without Ed noticing. The tattoo begins to talk again, convincing Ed to redial Scully's last call to see who she was {{speaking}} to. An FBI operator answers and, upon learning that Scully is an FBI agent, the tattoo forces Ed to attack her. Scully tries to escape but is overpowered by Ed, who wraps her in a bedsheet and carries her {{down to the basement}} to throw her in the furnace. At the last moment, Ed is able to overpower the impulses of the tattoo and instead thrusts his own arm into the furnace.|$|E
5|$|In the city, {{they are}} escorted to their hotel by {{agents of the}} Bordurian secret police, who have been ordered to monitor the duo by police chief Colonel Sponsz. Aware {{that they are being}} monitored, Tintin and Haddock escape the hotel and hide in the opera house, where Bianca Castafiore is performing. When police come searching for them, they hide in Castafiore's closet; when Sponsz comes to visit Castafiore in her {{dressing}} room, Tintin is able to steal papers that will secure Calculus' release from the fortress of Bakhine from his <b>coat</b> <b>pocket.</b> After disguising themselves as officials from the Red Cross, Tintin and Haddock are able to get Calculus released from prison and with him escape from Borduria in a tank. Back at Marlinspike Hall, Calculus reveals that he forgot to take his plans for the ultrasonic device with him to Geneva, and that he had left them at home all along; he destroys the plans so that they cannot be used to create a weapon.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins when}} a young man is seen walking alone {{in a small town}} to the snowy {{football}} fields in a morning winter. A cut-scene shows Swift inside a house wearing a comfy sweater draped over one shoulder. She is brooding and singing about her lost love while wandering morosely around her apartment. She is also seen sitting in the bathtub, missing her boyfriend who she didn't treat well when they were together. About halfway through, it starts to snow inside the spacious house. A montage of Swift writing a letter is shown alternately with scenes of her boyfriend strolling around the town. It is then revealed that the whole situation is the aftermath of a break-up between Swift and her boyfriend. It is also shown that Swift slips the letter that she has written in his <b>coat</b> <b>pocket</b> before he leaves. The final scene shows her ex-boyfriend sitting in the bleachers, reading her apology letter.|$|E

5|$|Ellen tells Mulder {{that she}} saw a {{reflection}} in the mirror earlier, and that's what killed Martha. Mulder believes the glass are doorways to a demonic dimension and that someone is summoning forth a demon to attack people. Ellen believes Jenny Uphouse summoned the spirits, but she denies it. Later, Ellen finds a skeleton key in her house and a raven by her baby's crib. In a mirror, Ellen sees the reflection of a monster chasing after her, but it suddenly breaks. She hides in the closet until Phil comes home and finds her. However, he attributes the commotion to stress, believing that she is imagining things. Mulder finds the skeleton key and it matches one found in Martha Crittendon's <b>coat</b> <b>pocket.</b> Mulder deduces that the sheriff is having an affair with Jenny. Mulder later tells him that Martha was pregnant and that he thinks he is the father. The sheriff reveals that the key opened the door to a motel, where he and Jenny met for clandestine affairs. Meanwhile, at the motel, Jenny sees ravens outside and is promptly attacked and killed by the creature.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the defence}} team's main {{grounds of appeal}} was that the single {{particle}} of gunshot residue in the <b>coat</b> <b>pocket</b> was not evidence which conclusively linked George to the crime scene; it could have appeared {{as a result of}} contamination of the coat when it was placed on a mannequin to be photographed as police evidence.|$|E
25|$|Dodge {{joined the}} Union Army in the Civil War. At the {{beginning}} of the war, Dodge was sent by the Governor of Iowa to Washington, D.C., where he secured 6,000 muskets to supply Iowa volunteers. In July 1861, he was appointed Colonel of the 4th Iowa Volunteer Infantry Regiment. He was wounded in the left leg, near Rolla, Missouri, when a pistol in his <b>coat</b> <b>pocket</b> discharged accidentally.|$|E

25|$|For several years, Henri divided {{his time}} between Philadelphia and Paris, where he met the Canadian artist James Wilson Morrice. Morrice {{introduced}} Henri {{to the practice of}} painting pochades on tiny wood panels that could be carried in a <b>coat</b> <b>pocket</b> along with a small kit of brushes and oil. This method facilitated the kind of spontaneous depictions of urban scenes which would come to be associated with his mature style.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, {{while working}} on the Naval Staff at the Ministry of Defence, West left {{documents}} detailing large cuts to the Navy on a canal towpath. These documents were recovered and then published by a journalist from the Mail on Sunday. At a subsequent court martial West pleaded guilty to charges of negligence and breaching security. He explained that they had fallen from his <b>coat</b> <b>pocket</b> whilst walking a friend's dog. West was issued with a severe reprimand, the second lightest sentence available. The severe reprimand that he received was time expired before he became eligible for promotion to flag rank.|$|E
25|$|In June 2009, Doherty {{was arrested}} in Gloucester and charged with driving dangerously, while drunk, and in {{possession}} of heroin. He was released on a £50,000 bail and after 'guilty' pleas were entered, was asked to return to court on 21 December for sentencing. He was spared jail but was ordered to pay £2,050 in fines, and was banned from driving for 18 months, despite the court hearing Doherty had 21 previous drug offences and six motoring offences. Following his release from court, he was escorted by officers to the nearest police station and re-arrested for possession of a controlled substance, later revealed to be heroin. The following day, 22 December, it emerged that Doherty could be charged with offences linked to a hit-and-run incident, which left a pedestrian in a critical condition. His manager, Andrew Boyd, appeared in court charged {{with a number of}} offences relating to the incident. While Doherty was in Gloucester court on 21 December, heroin fell out of his <b>coat</b> <b>pocket.</b> He was arrested for possession and was convicted for this offence at the same court on 27 January 2010. He was fined £750 and ordered to pay £85 court costs.|$|E

25|$|It {{emerged during}} the {{cross-examination}} of Fung and the other laboratory scientists that the police scientist Andrea Mazzola (who collected blood samples from Simpson to compare with evidence from the crime scene) was a trainee who carried the vial of Simpson's blood around in her lab <b>coat</b> <b>pocket</b> for nearly a day before handing it over as an exhibit. While two errors {{had been found in}} the history of DNA testing at Cellmark, one of the testing laboratories, in 1988 and 1989, the errors were found during quality control tests and had not occurred since. One of the companies hired for DNA consulting by Simpson's defense had made the same error as found in 1988. What should have been the prosecution's strong point became their weak link, amid defense accusations that police technicians handled the blood samples with such a degree of incompetence as to render the delivery of accurate and reliable DNA results almost impossible. The prosecution argued that they had made the DNA evidence available to the defense for its own testing, and if the defense attorneys disagreed with the prosecution's tests, they could have conducted their own testing on the same samples. The defense had chosen not to accept the prosecution's offer.|$|E
500|$|A {{homeless}} man {{lives on the}} corner of Miranda's street. She calls him the [...] "laughing man" [...] for his tendency to laugh without cause. Miranda notices that he always utters the words [...] "book bag pocket shoe." [...] She later realizes the phrase refers to the order and place he will send Miranda notes—her library book, a bread bag, her <b>coat</b> <b>pocket</b> and Richard's shoe. The first three notes instruct Miranda to write a letter describing the future events. The notes, whose writer claims to be coming to Miranda's time to save a life, offer three signs of the truth of the messages. As the plot develops, the proofs come true, and Miranda is intrigued.|$|E
500|$|The {{next morning}} White went to City Hall armed with his police [...]38 Smith & Wesson {{revolver}} and 10 extra cartridges in his <b>coat</b> <b>pocket.</b> To avoid the metal detector {{he entered the}} building through a basement window, and proceeded {{to the office of}} Mayor George Moscone. [...] Following a brief argument, White shot the Mayor in the shoulder and chest, and then twice in the head. White then walked to his former office, reloading his gun, and asked Milk to join him. White then shot Milk in the wrist, shoulder and chest, and then twice in the head, execution style. Supervisor Dianne Feinstein heard the gunshots and called the police, who found Milk on his stomach, blood pouring out of his head wounds.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{but just}} as good as the other. You don't ever munch sugar, do you? It's bad for the teeth. I'll take the sugar." [...] So the paper of sugar was {{likewise}} dropped into one of the capacious <b>coat</b> <b>pockets.</b>|$|R

500|$|Outside {{the court}} house where Ike was being fined, Wyatt almost walked into 28 year-old Tom McLaury {{as the two}} men were brought up short nose-to-nose. Tom, who had arrived in town the day before, was {{required}} by the well-known city ordinance to deposit his pistol when he first arrived in town. When Wyatt demanded, [...] "Are you heeled or not?", McLaury said he was not armed. Wyatt testified that he saw a revolver in plain sight on the right hip of Tom's pants. As an unpaid deputy marshal for Virgil, Wyatt habitually carried a pistol in his waistband, as was the custom of that time. Witnesses reported that Wyatt drew his revolver from his <b>coat</b> <b>pocket</b> and pistol whipped Tom McLaury with it twice, leaving him prostrate and bleeding on the street. Saloon-keeper Andrew Mehan testified at the Spicer hearing afterward that he saw McLaury deposit a revolver at the Capital Saloon sometime between 1–2:00 pm, after the confrontation with Wyatt, which Mehan also witnessed.|$|E
500|$|On {{the day of}} the shooting, {{the start}} of school had been delayed by snow and not all {{students}} had arrived when the shooting began. Just before 9:00 a.m. (UTC-8), fourteen-year-old student James Scott Newman brought his mother's [...]38-caliber revolver to the school in his backpack. He removed the concealed pistol from his <b>coat</b> <b>pocket</b> and loaded it with three [...]38 caliber rounds while in the bathroom. [...] He chose his target, student Alexander Rueda, 14, at random in a hallway outside the cafeteria. [...] Before he started firing, a friend of Newman yelled at him to put the gun away, but Newman told him to run. He pulled the trigger twice but the gun did not fire because those chambers were empty. He then fired three times at Rueda. [...] One bullet hit Rueda in the arm and torso, and another ricocheted and hit student Kenzie McKeon, 14, in the leg from the shrapnel. [...] The two injured students had no prior relationship or arguments with Newman. [...] Several students and teachers heard the shots and the physical education teacher, Jencie Fagan, approached Newman and challenged him. Fagan managed to convince Newman to drop his gun and then restrained him until more staff arrived to help.|$|E
500|$|The British company Webley & Scott (P. Webley & Son before {{merger with}} W & C Scott in 1897) {{produced}} {{a range of}} revolvers from the mid 19th to late 20th centuries. [...] As early as 1853 P. Webley and J. Webley began production of their first patented single action cap and ball revolvers. [...] Later under the trade name of P. Webley and Son, manufacturing included their own [...]44-caliber rim-fire solid frame revolver as well as licensed copies of Smith & Wesson's Tip up break action revolvers. [...] The quintessential hinged frame, centre-fire revolvers for which the Webley name is best known first began production/development in the early 1870s most notably with the Webley-Pryse (1877) and Webley-Kaufman (1881) models. [...] The W.G. or Webley-Government models produced from 1885 through to the early 1900s, (often incorrectly {{referred to as the}} Webley-Green) are the most popular of the commercial top break revolvers and many were the private purchase choice of English military officers and target shooters in the period, coming in a [...]476/.455 calibre. [...] However other short-barrel solid-frame revolvers, including the Webley RIC (Royal Irish Constabulary) model and the British Bulldog revolver, designed to be carried in a <b>coat</b> <b>pocket</b> for self-defence were far more commonplace during the period. [...] Today, undoubtedly best-known are the range of military revolvers, which were in service use across two World Wars and numerous colonial conflicts.|$|E
