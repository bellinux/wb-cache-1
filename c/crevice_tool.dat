50|$|In 1996 the Ultra Hand Vac was {{introduced}} with more suction and a built-in stretch hose and <b>crevice</b> <b>tool.</b> The Ultra Hand Vac is still available at some retailers and department stores.|$|E
50|$|In June, 2008, Dirt Devil {{introduced}} {{a line of}} cordless handheld vacuums with AccuCharge Technology. AccuCharge is the first cordless vacuum line that is Energy Star approved and reduces 70% in energy consumption compared to most cordless vacuums. The cordless hand vac & stick vac are {{the first in the}} AccuCharge lineup. The Dirt Devil AccuCharge Cordless Hand Vac and Cordless Stick Vac use 15.6 Volt Nickel Cadmium batteries. Charging time for both units is 6 hours. The Hand Vac has a unique flip-down <b>crevice</b> <b>tool</b> built into the nozzle and it weighs 3.25 lbs. The Stick Vac weighs 5.85 lbs and has a motorized brushbar that can be turned on or off.|$|E
50|$|Numatic {{have also}} made many vacuum {{cleaners}} differing from the 2010 range. Many {{of them are not}} sold as 2016. The Henry and Hetty vacuum cleaners have also gone beyond vacuum cleaners. They have since 2010 expanded to desktop cleaners, toys,spray mops, boxes, office file holders and a specially made Airo-Brush head has been made for the Henry. When the Henry vacuum cleaner was first released in 1981, consumer had a sticker placed on the Henry. This meant they had to register to the company for insured life of the vacuum. Accessories include stainless steel tubes, HepaFlo dust bags, an upholstery tool, a <b>crevice</b> <b>tool,</b> a Nuflex threaded hose, a double taper hose/full adapter, a Numatic Airo-Brush Head with rotating bristles(For HenryXtra), a soft dusting brush and an upholstery nozzle with a sliding brush.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} known for using plant {{material}} to create stick and leaf tools to capture prey hiding in cracks and <b>crevices.</b> These <b>tools</b> can have naturally occurring barbs, or are sometimes fashioned into hooks by the birds. The tool is inserted into the crack or crevice in the log or branch, and the prey is agitated into biting the tool. The crow then withdraws the tool with prey still attached, and devours the prey. Grubs caught in this way {{have been shown to}} be an integral part of the crows' diet. The New Caledonian crow appears to fill the ecological niche of the woodpeckers and the woodpecker finch of the Galapagos, since the latter and New Caledonia lack woodpeckers. The feeding method of the woodpecker finch differs in that it stabs at grubs and levers them slowly out of the log using a small twig.|$|R
5000|$|This species uses stick {{tools in}} the wild by finding small twigs and probing them into hole in logs to extract insects and larvae. New Caledonian crows are also able to {{manufacture}} tools by breaking twigs off bushes and trimming them to produce functional stick tools. Tool manufacture is rare in comparison to simple tool use and indicates {{a higher level of}} cognitive function. The crows can also make leaf tools by tearing rectangular strips off the edges of Pandanus spp. leaves. [...] The creation of such leaf tools allows these crows to exploit naturally occurring hooks - the barbs running along the edges of these leaves can be used as hooks if the tool is held such that the barbs point towards the crows’ head. Other naturally occurring hooks are also incorporated within tools, such as the thorns that grow on vine species in New Caledonia. These crows create hooks by crafting both wood and ferns into hooks. This is done by trimming the junctions between two branches or fern stolons into a tick shape (i.e. one junction has a long piece of wood/stolon attached, one junction has a small piece of wood /stolon attached) and then removing material from this junction to create a functioning hook. This imposition of three-dimensional form onto a natural material resembles carving.The crows make a variety of tools. [...] Crows snip into the leaf edges and then tear out neat strips of vegetation with which they can probe insect-harboring <b>crevices.</b> These <b>tools</b> have been observed to come in three types: narrow strips, wide strips and multi-stepped strips—which are wide at one end and, via a manufacturing process that involves stepwise snips and tears, become narrow at the opposite end.|$|R
2500|$|Perhaps {{the best}} known and most studied example of an avian tool user is the {{woodpecker}} finch (Camarhynchus pallidus) from the Galápagos Islands. If the bird uncovers prey in bark which is inaccessible, the bird then flies off to fetch a cactus spine which it may use {{in one of three}} different ways: as a goad to drive out an active insect (without necessarily touching it); as a spear with which to impale a slow-moving larva or similar animal; or as an implement with which to push, bring towards, nudge or otherwise manoeuvre an inactive insect from a <b>crevice</b> or hole. <b>Tools</b> that do not exactly fit the purpose are worked by the bird and adapted for the function, thus making the finch a [...] "tool maker" [...] as well as a [...] "tool user". Some individuals have been observed to use a different type of tool with novel functional features such as barbed twigs from blackberry bushes, a plant that is not native to the islands. The twigs were first modified by removing side twigs and leaves and then used such that the barbs helped drag prey out of tree crevices.|$|R
