40|$|<b>Compressed</b> gas <b>cylinders</b> {{contaminated}} with radionuclides are a unique waste item that {{may become a}} Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) hazardous waste through two mechanisms: either {{the contents of the}} <b>compressed</b> gas <b>cylinder</b> are regulated under RCRA or the internal pressure of the <b>compressed</b> gas <b>cylinder</b> gives it the characteristic of reactivity. The characteristic of reactivity is defined by RCRA in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 261. 23 (a) (6) as a waste that is capable of detonation or explosive reaction if it is subjected to a strong initiating source or heated under confinement. In a letter dated September 1, 1989, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Solid Waste referred the interpretation of the definition of reactivity to the EPA Regional Office and/or the state (if the state has primacy). The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) has made the interpretation that to meet the definition of reactive as specified in 40 CFR 261. 23 (a) (6) there must be a chemical reaction that causes the explosion or detonation. This interpretation limits the <b>compressed</b> gas <b>cylinders</b> that have to be treated as RCRA hazardous waste to those that have other RCRA characteristic codes or contain listed wastes. The difficulty in treating <b>compressed</b> gas <b>cylinders</b> is heightened in the case of radiologically contaminated <b>compressed</b> gas <b>cylinders</b> because the internal pressure and possible hazardous constituents must be treated in most cases before decontamination of the cylinder is possible. Special procedures must be followed to ensure that radiological contamination is not transferred to clean gas cylinders or released into the environment...|$|R

When liquid CO2 is used to chill theatrical fog, the result is a thick fog that stays within a few feet of the ground. As the fog warms, or is agitated, it rises and dissipates. Several manufacturers of theatrical fog fluid have developed specially formulated mixtures specifically designed to be used with CO2, intended to provide thicker, more consistent fog effects. Effect duration is determined by the heating cycle of the theatrical fog machine and consumption rate of liquid CO2.|$|R

40|$|Buckling {{loads of}} thick-walled, orthotropic, simply-supported right {{circular}} cylinders are predicted {{using a new}} higher-order transverse shear deformation theory. The higher-order theory shows that, by more accurately accounting for transverse shear deformation effects, the predicted buckling load may be reduced {{by as much as}} 80 percent compared to predictions based on conventional transverse shear deformation theory. A parametric study of the effect of ply orientation on the buckling load of axially <b>compressed</b> <b>cylinders</b> indicates that laminates containing 0 deg plies are the most sensitive to transverse shear deformation effects. Interaction curves for buckling of cylinders with axial compressive and external pressure loadings indicate that buckling loads due to external pressure loadings are much less sensitive to transverse shear deformation effects than those due to axial compressive loadings...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of research in}} the field of axially <b>compressed</b> <b>cylinders</b> is the establishment of sound design principles.

The most critical need at the present is believed to be for additional tests, which, unlike most previous tests, will be designed specifically to provide general information about the buckling process. This investigation adds to the general study on the buckling of thin-walled cylindrical shells fabricated from the polyester film, Mylar. It was concluded that the number of cir-cumferential buckles, which controls the postbuckling behavior of cylinders, is dependent on the geometric parameters, R/t and L/R. Such dependence is approximated byde Neufville's solution: 1 / 4 N = 2. 2...|$|R

Three tanks of bottled hydrogen were also placed in a circular configuration around the main charge, to enhance the fireball and afterburn of the solid metal particles. The use of <b>compressed</b> gas <b>cylinders</b> {{in this type of}} attack closely resembles the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing 10 years earlier.

40|$|Dynamic Mechanic Analysis, DMA, is a {{sensitive}} method {{to determine the}} glass transition temperature (Tg) of materials. Several different sample geometries such as three point bending, stretched films or <b>compressed</b> <b>cylinders,</b> are commonly used. The Tg of a powder is related to its “sticky point”, i. e. the temperature when the powder particles interact instead of flowing freely. The determination of powder Tg is not straightforward using DMA due to the limiting geometry. Here it is demonstrated that the Tg of powder samples can be effectively and correctly determined by DMA on compacts in compression mode, using a standard wedge shaped probe usually utilized in three point bend analysis. The analysis of compacts holds the benefits of analysing powder samples as received from manufacturers, being relatively robust with regard to deformation as the material becomes rubbery, and enabling easy sample preparation and handling...|$|R
