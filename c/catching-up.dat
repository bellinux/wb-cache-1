The leading Norwegian daily paper Dagbladet however invited both the author Nima Sanandaji, and his critics to give their perspective. Einar Lier, {{professor}} in economic history, and Thori Lind, researcher in social economics, criticized the book by writing that most researchers already know that Nordic prosperity preceded the welfare state. The two authors also criticize the comparison that Sanandaji does, showing that the life span difference between Norway and the US was larger in 1960, before the shift towards a large welfare state in Norway, than after this transformation had occurred. According to Lier and Lind, this comparison is not relevant since the rising life expectancy in the US is explained by a <b>catching-up</b> of African Americans.|$|E

50|$|As barchan dunes migrate, smaller dunes outpace larger dunes, <b>catching-up</b> {{the rear}} of the larger dune and {{eventually}} appear to punch through the large dune to appear on the other side. The process appears superficially similar to waves of light, sound, or water that pass directly through each other, but the detailed mechanism is very different. The dunes emulate soliton behavior, but unlike solitons, which flow through a medium leaving it undisturbed (think of waves through water), the sand particles themselves are moved. When the smaller dune catches up the larger dune, the winds begin to deposit sand on the rear dune while blowing sand off the front dune without replenishing it. Eventually, the rear dune has assumed dimensions similar to the former front dune which has now become a smaller, faster moving dune that pulls away with the wind.|$|E
5000|$|After 1950, Germany overtook Britain in {{comparative}} productivity levels {{for the whole}} economy, primarily {{as a result of}} trends in services rather than trends in industry. The Marshall Plan was eagerly adopted in Germany as a way to modernize business procedures and utilize the best practices, while these changes were resisted in Britain. [...] Britain's historic lead in productivity of its services sector was based on external economies of scale in a highly urbanized economy with an international orientation. On the other hand, the low productivity in Germany was caused by the underdevelopment of services generally, especially in rural areas that comprised a much larger sector. As German farm employment declined sharply after 1950 thanks to mechanization, <b>catching-up</b> occurred in services. This process was aided by a sharp increase in human and physical capital accumulation, a pro-growth government policy, and the effective utilization of the education sector to create a more productive work force.|$|E
50|$|The most {{significant}} {{evolution of the}} early 2000s in the economic landscape was the long-time predicted breakthrough of economic giant China, which had double-digit growth during nearly the whole decade. To a lesser extent, India also benefited from an economic boom which saw the two most populous countries becoming an increasingly dominant economic force. The rapid <b>catching-up</b> of emerging economies with developed countries sparked some protectionist tensions during the period and was partly responsible {{for an increase in}} energy and food prices {{at the end of the}} decade. The economic developments in the latter third of the decade were dominated by a worldwide economic downturn, which started with the crisis in housing and credit in the United States in late 2007, and led to the bankruptcy of major banks and other financial institutions. The outbreak of this global financial crisis sparked a global recession, beginning in the United States and affecting most of the industrialized world.|$|E

50|$|Differences in the {{investment}} rates between countries very often mirror {{different levels of}} economic development and <b>catching-up</b> processes. This may be illustrated for {{the example of the}} member states of the European Union. Since the beginning of the millennium the average ratio of GFCF to GDP fluctuates around 20% in the European Union of 27 member states as a whole (EU-27). For some member states which accessed the Union in 2004 and later (mostly countries in central and eastern Europe where the level of GDP is still comparably low), the ratio rose to more than 25% in some years. When the consumption of fixed capital is deducted from the figures the resulting ratio of net fixed capital formation to net domestic product is around 8% for the average of the EU-27; again substantially higher ratios of more than 15% can be observed for some of the new EU member states such as Spain. Higher investment rates in poorer countries will lead to more equivalent living condition across Europe in the long-term through accelerated economic growth and an improved equipment of the labour force with modern infrastructure and technology.

50|$|Megson {{had been}} sacked {{just days after}} his 'best win of my (Gary Megson) career', leaving the club third in the table with sixty points from thirty-three games. The news was a {{surprise}} to all supporters of football across the country and Sheffield Wednesday fans were unhappy with the dismissal of manager and Wednesday supporter himself Gary Megson. With Milan Mandaric taking such a big decision, it was in hope of 'still reaching the automatic promotion spot', although still with some games left it would prove to be a very difficult, and looking an almost impossible task for any manager. With rivals Sheffield United second in the league, having the potential to go eight points clear and although losing against Wednesday still seemingly in good form. And a team in such a high position in the league and having a much bigger goal difference the chances of Sheffield Wednesday catching them up and going ahead of them looked very slim. Assistant manager Chris Evans and first-team coach Neil Thompson were confirmed to take control of first-team affairs until a new appointment was made. Milan Mandaric was expected to make a quick appointment as a loss of such large possible consequences, it was sure a particular new manager was in mind. Also as well as the fans' anger, they were worried the effect of the dismissal of Megson would have on the players. After, scoring such a valuable and pride winning goal majority of the players went over to hug Gary Megson, showing a strong player-to-manager relationship. On 2 March Sheffield Wednesday announced a press conference where confirmed the expected appointment of new manager Dave Jones. Dave Jones was rumoured to take the job ever since and before Gary Megson's dismissal. The game against Rochdale the next day finished goalless with Dave Jones watching from the sidelines. Meanwhile, at Sheffield an amazing game took place at Bramall Lane, as Sheffield United were leading comfortably by 2-0 at half time before Oldham Athletic scored two in four minutes to equalise, and then The Blades went down to ten men and then nine as they conceded a penalty in the last minute of the game. Former-Sheffield Wednesday striker Shefki Kuqi scored from the spot and Oldham Athletic won 2-3. This meant Sheffield Wednesday caught up by one point. Dave Jones's first game in charge was shortly after his appointment in a mid-week game at Hillsborough Stadium against Bury. The Owls took an early lead on the eleventh minute with Michail Antonio getting his first goal for the club, Antonio went on to score another as Gary Madine and Ryan Lowe scored as Wednesday won 4-1, a great start to Dave Jones's Sheffield Wednesday managerial career. Meanwhile, Walsall won Sheffield United 3-2, The Owls <b>catching-up</b> by a further three points meaning they were one point behind, however Sheffield United still had a game in hand meaning they could potentially be four points ahead. A second consecutive home game saw Sheffield Wednesday face Bournemouth. Fans could not believe their eyes as goals from Danny Batth, Miles Addison (own goal), and Michail Antonio saw Wednesday 3-0 up inside ten minutes, but that is how the game finished. Sheffield Wednesday were disappointed however as Sheffield United managed to get back to winning ways as they won Brentford 0-2, their wonder top-scorer Ched Evans getting both. Mid-week saw The Blades play their game in hand and drew 1-1 with Colchester United and suddenly was only two points ahead after having the potential to be eight just weeks before. Also, young goalkeeper was loaned to Worksop Town {{for the rest of the}} season to get some experience around a first-team squad. Sheffield Wednesday however faced Notts County the next weekend away, and they were incredible form, having been 4-0 up on top of the league Charlton Athletic at just half-time. A tough battle as it was expected to be fortunately saw Sheffield Wednesday win 1-2, by far Dave Jones's toughest game yet. Goals from Ryan Lowe and Gary Madine, before Lloyd Sam pulled a late goal back for Notts County. At Bramall Lane Sheffield United only drew with Tranmere Rovers, meaning Sheffield Wednesday were now level on points, however The Blades had a significant better goal difference. Back at Hillsborough Stadium and The Owls faced Walsall, the team that brought back bad memories for Wednesday fans having conceded two goals in stoppage time the last time the teams met. At half-time it was goalless while Sheffield United were comfortably beating Notts County by a surprisingly large amount of 0-4. With The Blades bound to win their game, Sheffield Wednesday had to stay on track with them. However, Sheffield Wednesday found themselves 1-2 down and after pushing late for an equaliser, it was the last kick of the game as Gary Madine scored in the ninety-fifth minute against relegation-threatened Walsall. The fans went home disappointed as they felt it was a game they could have won, however it was seconds away from being a 'catastrophy' as Dave Jones described it. After not impressing in the team, loanee John Bostock was recalled by Tottenham Hotspur after making six appearances for the club, meanwhile as the emergency-loan transfer market came towards a close Dave Jones brought in Keith Treacy on loan from Burnley and Nile Ranger on loan from Newcastle United - both on loan until the end of the season. The next game was against Leyton Orient, Reda Johnson's goal won the game for The Owls, as both Keith Treacy and Nile Ranger made their debuts for the club after coming off the bench. Sheffield United did not play as their opponents Chesterfield played in the Football League Trophy, this meaning that Sheffield Wednesday temporarily went into second as Sheffield United played rivals Chesterfield mid-week and won 4-1. The last game of a quite long, but incredible month, came and Sheffield Wednesday featured in an early kick-off live on Sky Sports. They won 2-0, after a double-brace by Madine, while later Sheffield United also won again 0-1. Both teams in form, it set up a fantastic end of the season as April came closer and could decide the two fierce rivals between automatic promotion and who would have to settle for the play-offs.|$|E

In this paper we follow up the impact of the unit profit or 'rent' patterns on foreign direct investment and through that on the speed of technology transfer and hence on differential productivity growth.

Second, we investigate the role of multinational plants in accelerating the <b>catching-up</b> process by non-frontier domestic plants. Our results show evidence of productivity <b>catching-up,</b> and that a larger presence of multinationals positively contributes to this phenomenon. These findings are consistent with the idea of technology spillovers from high to low-productivity plants or that a higher presence of multinationals increase competitiveness and productivity in domestic markets. technology transfer; total factor productivity; TFP; catching-up; multinational corporations; MNCs; Chile; manufacturing plants. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} <b>catching-up</b> process {{in per capita}} income of the {{so-called}} Asian Dragons and Tigers. It {{contributes to the literature}} in several ways. First, it tests the <b>catching-up</b> hypothesis using the longest time span ever considered, from 1870 to 2014. Second, it documents the experiences of these two groups of countries and provides potential explanations for them. Third, by using the Kejriwal and Perron (2010) algorithm, we are able to endogenously estimate multiple structural breaks in the level and the trend of the series without prior knowledge of their integration level. This surpasses technical concerns of previous empirical studies. Fourth, it inquires into how the Asian financial crisis affected the <b>catching-up</b> process among the Dragons' and Tigers' economies...|$|E
40|$|Summary: In this paper, {{different}} {{tests of}} unit root in panel data are implemented for studying real economic convergence and <b>catching-up</b> in ten {{new members of}} European Union (EU) toward average EU per capita income and average of ancient members. We used the “EuroStat ” quarterly real per capita output data on the period 1995 - 2005. The results support existence of absolute convergence and <b>catching-up</b> processes in sample countries towards EU standards...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we look at}} {{the role}} of export {{composition}} in the growth process, considering how increased similarity in trade structure among countries can induce <b>catching-up</b> in income levels in a group of countries in transition. We analyze the sectoral export patterns of the Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs) by comparing them to those of the current members of the European Union (EU), focusing on countries' specialization as suppliers for the EU market, and we assess whether similar export patterns foster the <b>catching-up</b> process of the CEECs. Our main result is that similarity in export composition has a positive, significant and non-linear impact on <b>catching-up,</b> and seems to be driven by the growth of the main export market and delocalization of production more than by other factors.
