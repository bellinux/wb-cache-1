25|$|An {{interesting}} {{point of the}} design was {{that it did not}} use a traditional helical coiled recoil spring, but used a spiral spring, much like a large <b>clock</b> <b>spring,</b> in a semicircular housing {{just in front of the}} trigger. The operating rod had a toothed underside, which engaged with a cog which wound the spring. When the gun fired, the bolt recoiled and the cog was turned, tightening the spring until the resistance of the spring had reached the recoil force of the bolt assembly. At that moment, as the gas pressure in the breech fell, the spring unwound, turning the cog, which, in turn, wound the operating rod forward for the next round. As with a <b>clock</b> <b>spring,</b> the Lewis gun recoil spring had an adjustment device to alter the recoil resistance for variations in temperature and wear. Unusual as it seems, the Lewis design proved reliable and was even copied by the Japanese and used extensively by them during the Second World War.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the entire}} {{province}} is geographically within the MST (UTC-7) zone, the province is officially {{part of the}} Central time zone (UTC-6). As a result, while most of Saskatchewan does not change <b>clocks</b> <b>spring</b> and fall, it technically observes DST year round. This means that clocks {{in most of the}} province match clocks in Winnipeg during the winter and Calgary and Edmonton during the summer. This time zone designation was implemented in 1966, when the Saskatchewan Time Act was passed in order to standardize time province-wide.|$|R

50|$|A {{sash window}} is the {{traditional}} style of window in the United Kingdom, and many other places that were formerly colonized by the UK, with two parts (sashes) that overlap slightly and slide up and down inside the frame. The two parts {{are not necessarily the}} same size; where the upper sash is smaller (shorter) it is termed a cottage window. Currently most new double-hung sash windows use spring balances to support the sashes, but traditionally, counterweights held in boxes {{on either side of the}} window were used. These were and are attached to the sashes using pulleys of either braided cord or, later, purpose-made chain. Three types of spring balances are called a tape or <b>clock</b> <b>spring</b> balance; channel or block-and-tackle balance; and a spiral or tube balance.|$|E
5000|$|Jeff Wassmann, an American {{artist who}} has lived in Australia for the past 25 years, uses items found on beaches and junk stores in his travels to create the early Modern works of a fictional German relative, Johann Dieter Wassmann (1841-1898).

Wassmann is unusual among artists in that he does not sell his work, rather they are presented as gifts; by not allowing these works to re-enter the consumer cycle, he averts the commodification of his end product.|$|E
50|$|The antenna {{includes}} two conductive spirals or arms, {{extending from the}} center outwards. The antenna may be a flat disc, with conductors resembling a pair of loosely nested <b>clock</b> <b>springs,</b> or the spirals may extend in a three-dimensional shape like a screw thread. The direction of rotation of the spiral defines the direction of antenna polarization. Additional spirals may be included as well, to form a multi-spiral structure. Usually the spiral is cavity-backed, that {{is there is a}} cavity of air or non-conductive material or vacuum, surrounded by conductive walls; the cavity changes the antenna pattern to a unidirectional shape. The output of the antenna is a balanced line. If one input or output line is desired, for example a coaxial line, then a balun or other device is added to so transform the signals.|$|R
50|$|Almost all <b>spring</b> <b>clocks</b> {{employed}} rack striking. Gretton was {{an early}} adopter, if not the originator, of a strike/silent mechanism. Clocks employing this mechanism, but signed {{by at least one}} other maker (Hessenius), certainly originated from Gretton's workshop. Gretton was also an early adopter of mechanisms for silent-pull timepieces, several forms of which are known. Most Gretton <b>spring</b> <b>clocks</b> after about 1685 have a pull quarter repeat mechanism; several complex forms of this have been documented.|$|R
5000|$|The steel was {{produced}} in specialised workshops called 'crucible furnaces', which consisted of a workshop at ground level and a subterranean cellar. The furnace buildings varied in size and architectural style, growing in size towards {{the latter part of}} the 19th century as technological developments enabled multiple pots to be [...] "fired" [...] at once, using gas as a heating fuel. Each workshop had a series of standard features, such as rows of melting holes, teaming pits, roof vents, rows of shelving for the crucible pots and annealing furnaces to prepare each pot before firing. Ancillary rooms for weighing each charge and for the manufacture of the clay crucibles were either attached to the workshop, or located within the cellar complex. The steel, originally intended for making <b>clock</b> <b>springs,</b> was later used in other applications such as scissors, axes and swords.|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigates in-cab {{sound levels}} {{from the power}} {{steering}} in a Volvo FH truck. The sound is most prominent when turning the wheels while the truck is parked. Previous research carried out at Volvo {{has shown that the}} main source is the hydraulic servo pump.

The aim was to identify the transfer characteristics of different steering shaft prototypes and to study the influence of the steering installation from the steering gear and towards the cab interior in terms of noise and vibration. The work also includes a number of case studies such as the possible influence of the <b>clock</b> <b>spring</b> and driver introduced damping. Three different steering shafts and a steering gear has been tested in both freely suspended conditions and mounted in a previous field test Volvo FH timber truck. The steering shafts were excited with a shaker and the response measured in multiple positions, both as vibrations and radiated noise...|$|E

5000|$|Benjamin Huntsman was a clockmaker {{in search}} of a better steel for <b>clock</b> <b>springs.</b> In Handsworth near Sheffield, he began {{producing}} steel in 1740 after years of experimenting in secret. Huntsman's system used a coke-fired furnace capable of reaching 1,600 Â°C, into which up to twelve clay crucibles, each capable of holding about 15 kg of iron, were placed. When the crucibles or [...] "pots" [...] were white-hot, they were charged with lumps of blister steel, an alloy of iron and carbon produced by the cementation process, and a flux to help remove impurities. The pots were removed after about 3 hours in the furnace, impurities in the form of slag skimmed off, and the molten steel poured into moulds to end up as cast ingots. Complete melting of the steel produced a highly uniform crystal structure upon cooling, which gave the metal increased tensile strength and hardness compared to other steels being made at the time.|$|R
40|$|Twist Capsules are {{rotating}} {{electrical connections}} {{that are used}} when low noise electrical signals are required between a stationary connector and a mechanically oscillating one. Twist capsules are used throughout industry especially in areas that require exceptionally clean signals such as the space satellite industry and military applications. Due to {{the high cost of}} replacing parts on satellites launched into space and life-sustaining aspects of military applications, accurate modeling of these devices is essential to predict their behavior. <b>Clock</b> <b>spring</b> twist capsules use a flex tape, copper traces between two layers of Kapton, which rolls onto itself tightening against the shaft at one extreme and rolling out against the frame at the other extreme. This cyclic tightening and loosing can cause stresses on these flex tapes consequently, resulting in their failure due to fatigue. Therefore, it is imperative that some method be used to estimate the stresses in the flex tape in order that the optimal design parameters may be calculated. The natural progression from estimating the stresses is to predict the life of the twist capsule. Current techniques involve iteratively building physical models and heritag...|$|E
40|$|The {{conformable}} {{array data}} acquisition system consists of the array, the data acquisition and analysis hardware, and the data acquisition and analysis software. The following decisions {{were made in the}} development of the system. Array design decisions include the following: (a) The flexible array board will be approximately 8 by 12 inches square with the active coil section confined to a smaller 6 -inch-square section at the center of the board. The outer edges of the board will be used for switching and other circuitry. (b) The diameter of the array coils will be approximately 0. 375 inch (9. 5 mm). Data acquisition strategy includes: (a) The corrosion spots will be mapped by successive interrogations of the active section of the array board. Approximately 10, 000 samples will be acquired for each coil. The 10, 000 readings will be averaged to produce one lower-noise value for each coil. This will be repeated for each coil in the array in a sequential manner. The total corrosion image for the sector will be built from the individual coil data. (b) Corrosion larger than the operational portion of the array board will be measured using a grid technique. Uniquely identified areas in the grid will overlay a corroded area, and data collected for each area will be connected by the display and assessment software to form a composite image for the corroded area. (c) Defect assessment will be invoked on the corrosion image by ''boxing'' selected areas on the color contour map. Software decisions consisted of selecting the appropriate LABVIEW modules running in a Windows XP operating system to obtain the required functionality. This third quarterly report of the project presents the activity and conclusions reached to date.

5000|$|In 1815, Francis Ronalds {{published}} the first electric clock powered by dry pile batteries. [...] Alexander Bain, Scottish clockmaker, patented the electric clock in 1840. The electric clock's mainspring is wound either {{with an electric}} motor or with an electromagnet and armature. In 1841, he first patented the electromagnetic pendulum. By {{the end of the nineteenth}} century, the advent of the dry cell battery made it feasible to use electric power in <b>clocks.</b> <b>Spring</b> or weight driven clocks that use electricity, either alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC), to rewind the spring or raise the weight of a mechanical clock would be classified as an electromechanical clock. This classification would also apply to clocks that employ an electrical impulse to propel the pendulum. In electromechanical clocks the electricity serves no time keeping function. These types of clocks were made as individual timepieces but more commonly used in synchronized time installations in schools, businesses, factories, railroads and government facilities as a master clock and slave clocks.|$|R
50|$|The game {{of table}} hockey {{was invented in}} 1932, by the Canadian Donald H. Munro Sr., in Toronto.

That year, the family all pitched in and made the first table hockey game. This {{mechanical}} game was built out of scrap wood and metal, and included used coat hanger wire, butcher's twine, <b>clock</b> <b>springs,</b> and lumber from the coal bin. Unlike current games, the game looked more like an early pinball game, with one key difference: this was a two player game. The playing surface had a peak in the middle and sloped down toward each end. The players controlled levers for the goalie and flippers for the players. The story goes that a travelling salesman noticed the game and encouraged Don to take the game down to the local Eaton's department store. Don did just that. The first game went in on a consignment deal. By the time Mr. Munro got home, the game was sold and more orders were placed.|$|R
