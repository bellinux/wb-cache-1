PID controller {{in terms of the}} settling time while exhibiting a greater degree of robustness regarding disturbance rejection represented by severe changes in static and dynamic loads. The controller is used to change the duty cycle of the converter and thereby, the voltage is regulated. The buck converter, P, PI and PID controller are modeled and are evaluated by computer simulations. It has been found that the transient performance and steady state performance is improved using PID controller. SMPS design can produce very compact and lightweight supplies. Power conversion efficiencies of SMPS are 70 & 80 %. Implementation of SMPS by using FPGA, it gives the better performance and faster transient response. Improves the steady state performance and transient response by using PID controller, it is possible to design stable, efficient and ruggedized SMPS which has faster transient response for dynamically switching loads. In SMPS the switching action means the series regulator element is either on or off and therefore little energy is dissipated as heat and very high efficiency levels can be achieved.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the development and}} testing of a low-profile, high-voltage, spark-gap switch designed to be closely coupled with other components into an integrated high-energy pulsed-power source. The switch is designed to operate at 100 kV using SF 6 gas pressurized to less than 0. 7 MPa. The volume of the switch cavity region is less than 1. 5 cm 3, and the field stress along the gas-dielectric interface {{is as high as}} 130 kV/cm. The dielectric switch body has a low profile that is only I -cm tall at its greatest extent and nominally 2 -mm thick over most of its area. This design achieves a very low inductance of less than 5 nH, but results in field stresses exceeding 500 kV/cm in the dielectric material. Field modeling was done to determine the appropriate shape for the highly stressed insulator and electrodes, and special manufacturing techniques were employed to mitigate the usual mechanisms that induce breakdown and failure in solid dielectrics. Static breakdown tests verified that the switch operates satisfactorily at 100 kV levels. The unit has been characterized with different shaped electrodes having nominal gap spacings of 2. 0, 2. 5, and 3. 0 mm. The relationship between self-break voltage and operating pressure agrees well with published data on gas properties, accounting for the field enhancements of the electrode shapes being used. Capacitor discharge tests in a low inductance test fixture exhibited peak currents up to 25 kA with characteristic frequencies of the ringdown circuit ranging from 10 to 20 MHz. The ringdown waveforms and scaling of measured parameters agree well with circuit modeling of the switch and test fixture.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the proposed research is to use MEMS technology to develop low profile power inductors with minimized eddy current losses {{to be used in}} high power density <b>compact</b> <b>switching</b> converters. Eddy currents arise in high-flux density metallic cores as increased switching frequencies of DC-DC converters cause the skin depth to be small compared with the core thickness.

Previous research has been done to fabricate inductors with micron-scale laminated cores for high frequency switching converters. To optimize the previous fabrication technique, an automated electroplating system was developed for the fabrication of thick magnetic cores comprising large number of submicron laminations without human intervention.

However, the crosspoint buffers are small and segregated, thus how to efficiently use the buffers and avoid packet drops remains a major problem {{that needs to be}} addressed. In this paper, we consider load balancing, deflection routing, and buffer pooling for efficient buffer sharing in the CQ switch.
