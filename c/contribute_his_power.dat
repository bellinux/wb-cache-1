50|$|For all of <b>his</b> <b>power</b> and skill, Shishio had a fatal weakness: Because {{he was set}} on fire, most of his {{sweat glands}} were burned. Therefore, once he engaged in battle, his body heat rose far above normal levels. Though Hōji {{believed}} Shishio's body heat <b>contributed</b> to <b>his</b> <b>power</b> in battle, it became his downfall, as he spontaneously combusted after 30 minutes in battle.|$|R
50|$|Petagine entered {{professional}} baseball on February 13, 1990, {{at the age}} of 18, when Houston signed him as an undrafted amateur free agent after starting his career in Venezuela with the Leones del Caracas baseball team in which he <b>contributed</b> with <b>his</b> <b>power</b> for several campaigns becoming a star and a well-known baseball player in his country. Later that year, he played his first pro season with the rookie-level GCL Astros of the Gulf Coast League. His production there, and the following year with Single-A Burlington, was solid (if unspectacular). Petagine would go on to substantial minor league success in his early to mid 20s, but even his early stats hinted at the trends that would define—and perhaps curse—his career in American baseball: always having an above-average OBP, but relatively little home run power, by the standards historically applied to first basemen.|$|R
50|$|Medini Rai (died 1528) {{was one of}} Rana Sanga's most {{distinguished}} lieutenants. Chanderi was bestowed upon Medini Rai by Rana Sanga after his contribution in the Battle of Dholpur. Medini Rai was just a small warlord before the battle in Dholpur but he still <b>contributed</b> everything in <b>his</b> <b>power</b> {{for which he was}} rewarded by the Rana (He lead an army of 2,000 infantry). He assisted Rana Sanga in many campaigns against the Sultans of India. Medini Rai was later killed in the Battle of Chanderi against the Mughal emperor Babur, where he was given a chance to surrender but chose to die.|$|R

500|$|For {{nearly two}} decades Aqil had been a major local power in {{northern}} Palestine. He asserted to other tribal sheikhs that the land they roamed in belonged to the Arabs and that one day they would take it back from the Turkish Ottoman [...] "conquerors". According to Finn, Aqil may have ultimately envisioned forming an Arab confederation in the southern Levant independent of the Ottomans and backed by France. However, despite these perceived intentions, Aqil ruled {{under the auspices of}} the Ottoman authorities, was paid by them, and was at least partially dependent upon their support. His ties with France and Europe <b>contributed</b> to <b>his</b> <b>power,</b> but he lacked the necessary support from these countries to pursue any desire of independence that he had. Aqil's death marked the removal of [...] "the last obstacle to the implementation of full centralized Ottoman rule" [...] in northern Palestine, according to historian Mahmoud Yazbak. When full Ottoman centralization in the Galilee was realized, local powers permanently lost their influence over the region's development. That power was instead passed on to wealthy businessmen from Haifa and Beirut, ultimately leaving the Sursock family of Beirut as the new [...] "masters" [...] of the Galilee, according to anthropologist Alexander Schölch.|$|R
50|$|His wife having died in 1830, he {{was married}} {{in the summer of}} 1838 to Maria W. Anderson, of St. Augustine, Fla., and the next year went there to reside. In 1840 he was {{appointed}} Clerk of the U. S District Court for East Florida, and in 1842, U.S. Marshal for the same district, which office he held until Florida was admitted as a State three years later. In Jan. 1847, he was elected State Register of Public Lands (and ex officio Superintendent of Schools), and removed his residence to Tallahassee. This office he resigned in the summer of 1850, on his reluctant acceptance of the Democratic nomination for Congress. He was defeated, but a few months afterwards was elected Comptroller of Public Accounts, which position he resigned in 1854 to accept the agency of the Apalachicola Land Company. He {{was a member of the}} Florida Secession Convention in 1861, and during the war which followed <b>contributed</b> all of <b>his</b> <b>power</b> to make the cause of the South a success. He was again appointed to the Comptroller's office in 1866.|$|R
60|$|Nigel, {{but that}} his feeling of respectful {{delicacy}} to the unfortunate woman forebade {{him to do}} so, could here have communicated a circumstance corroborative of her suspicions, which had already occurred to his own mind. He recollected the hint that old Hildebrod threw forth on the preceding night, that some communication betwixt himself and Colepepper had hastened the catastrophe. As this communication related to the plan which Hildebrod had been pleased to form, of promoting a marriage betwixt Nigel himself and the rich heiress of Trapbois, the fear of losing an opportunity not to be regained, together with the mean malignity of a low-bred ruffian, disappointed in a favourite scheme, was most likely to instigate the bravo to the deed of violence which had been committed. The reflection that his own name was in some degree implicated with the causes of this horrid tragedy, doubled Lord Glenvarloch's anxiety in behalf of the victim whom he had rescued, {{while at the same}} time he formed the tacit resolution, that, so soon as his own affairs were put upon some footing, he would <b>contribute</b> all in <b>his</b> <b>power</b> towards the investigation of this bloody affair.|$|R
5|$|Secretariat's {{absence of}} major {{conformation}} flaws was important, as horses with well made limbs and feet {{are less likely}} to become injured.

When in full stride, his hind legs were able to reach far under himself, increasing his drive.

The instructor was revealed to be Dani Moonstar. At first Trauma tried to reject her (since he really wanted <b>his</b> <b>powers</b> to be neutralized instead); first by using <b>his</b> <b>powers</b> on Hank McCoy, then by attacking Dani by summoning the Demon Bear. However, Dani facing her fears against the creature years ago plus her training in self-defense allows her to easily force Trauma to reluctantly accept her help in controlling <b>his</b> <b>powers.</b>|$|R
