50|$|Wood-cement {{compatibility}} is {{the ratio}} of a parameter related to the property of a wood-cement composite {{to that of a}} neat cement paste. The compatibility is often expressed as a percentage value. To determine wood-cement compatibility, methods based on different properties are used, such as, hydration characteristics, strength, interfacial bond and morphology. Various methods are used by researchers such as the measurement of hydration characteristics of a cement-aggregate mix; the comparison of the mechanical properties of cement-aggregate mixes and the visual assessment of microstructural properties of the wood-cement mixes. It has been found that the hydration test by measuring the change in hydration temperature with time is the most convenient method. Recently, Karade et al. have reviewed these methods of <b>compatibility</b> <b>assessment</b> and suggested a method based on the ‘maturity concept’ i.e. taking in consideration both time and temperature of cement hydration reaction.|$|E

Defence date: 3 June 2013 This {{research}} aims {{to analyse}} {{the prohibition of}} State aid and <b>compatibility</b> <b>assessments</b> in the EU {{from the perspective of}} the 'more economic approach’ (MEA). The hypothesis enunciated in the thesis is that the MEA in State aid is applied in an instrumental manner, which goes beyond the paradigm of control justified by the coordination of national policies and the reduction of distortions of competition. Hence, the shift takes place with regard to: (i) the definition of the aims of public intervention and (ii) the methods of aid assessment. Firstly, by means of the MEA the Commission pursues a horizontal industrial policy, which presupposes a more pro-active approach and verification of the positive effects of aid, to the detriment of its negative effects. Secondly, the use of the MEA is policy driven - the Commission chooses the MEA to better regulate positive criteria for compatibility of aid, while avoiding applying refined economic analysis: (i) to the definition of aid and (ii) to assess the magnitude of the negative effects of aid. The research conducted here is oriented around four horizontal lines: (i) conflict and complementarities between competition and industrial policy, based on the analysis of State aid rules (ii) shift from negative to positive integration, which implies a transformation of State aid control and coordination into a State aid policy and has consequences for the aims and substantive criteria of the legal framework (iii) a 'better regulation’ of State aid by means of the MEA (iv) the competence of the Member States versus the competence of the Commission in the State aid legal framework...|$|R
40|$|Malnutrition in hospitalised {{patients}} {{is a serious}} and often underestimated problem. It is well established that the recognition and adequate treatment of malnutrition upon hospitalisation is of highest importance for a successful patient outcome. Nevertheless, the knowledge level for most health care professionals insofar as nutritional assessment and appropriate nutritional support is still low and training inadequate, especially that of the attending physicians who have first contact with patients. Errors in medication and nutritional therapy lead to increased morbidity and mortality, as well as prolonged treatment. Prevention of these oversights enables optimised and safe clinical nutritional therapy and also medication treatment. An interdisciplinary nutrition support team (NST) comprising a physician, dietitian, nurse and pharmacist {{is necessary for the}} good nutritional management of a patient from admission until discharge as well as further care at home. Their function includes nutritional assessment, evaluation and determination of individual nutritional requirements, recommendations for nutritional therapy and management of the nutritional care plan. There are different forms of clinical nutrition therapy to prevent and treat malnutrition when physiological feeding is not possible or insufficient. In particular, patients who are to receive home parenteral nutrition (HPN) require continuous monitoring by a well-educated NST. From the outset, the patient will be in steady contact with the hospital due to the need for long-term follow-up and mandatory monitoring for this complex and challenging treatment. 1, 2 The pharmacy profession is undergoing major transformations, therefore additional skills and knowledge are required to achieve best pharmaceutical practice and care. Many changes have occurred and thus, interdisciplinary cooperation becomes more important and HPN is used more and more, increasing the challenges of the pharmacist with these complex parenteral nutrition (PN) formulations. Technical and pharmaceutical developments have helped to establish safe, convenient and effective HPN. The pharmacist, as a member of an NST, can contribute by defining and evaluating best practices and efficiency to prevent medication errors, thus ensuring an increased quality of life (QoL). The role of the pharmacist as part of an NST depends on specific pharmaceutical expertise, including knowledge, experience and skills in the field of clinical nutrition, particularly in PN. Nutritional therapy as part of a patient’s overall treatment plan and therefore embedded in the medication therapy, requires the involvement of the pharmacy. 3 This thesis investigates pharmaceutical aspects in the field of clinical nutrition, focusing on aspects of PN in particular. The main objective of this thesis is to illustrate the various pharmaceutical activities in an NST throughout the clinical nutrition process with a focus on PN. To clarify, the research aims are: •	What role should the pharmacist play in an NST? •	Is he/she prepared for the professional challenges? •	Which best practices can the pharmacist provide to increase the quality of treatment, safety and QoL for a patient? To this end, four independent projects were defined in order to reach the aims: (I) 	What is the importance and role of the pharmacist? •	Identification of malnourished patients or patients at nutritional risk, where the pharmacist can make an important contribution. •	Responsibility for maintenance of professional competence in nutrition support management by providing education and skills training. (II a +b) 	Which contributions can the pharmacist give to provide a safe and effective drug and nutritional therapy and therefore an improved QoL? •	Monitoring and optimisation of nutrition support therapies including care for HPN patients and management of good nutritional supply, providing safe and effective treatment and therefore improving the patient’s QoL. Specific focus was given to the so far not prospectively analysed situation in Swiss adult HPN patients and benefit of HPN on QoL in patients with specific disease. (III) 	Which compounding related questions arise and which stability and <b>compatibility</b> <b>assessments</b> have to be done to ensure medication safety? •	Patients with long-term PN or critically ill patients especially need additional components or medications added to a PN admixture, requiring strict aseptic compounding and previous stability and <b>compatibility</b> <b>assessments.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Compatibility</b> <b>Assessment</b> Method (CAM), a new {{structured}} {{process for}} assessing compatibility between parent systems and child subsystems is proposed {{and applied to}} several cases where subsystems are being replaced in legacy systems. CAM is a screening process intended {{to be used by}} project managers who need to replace components of complex systems. The functional model-based process uses an extension of the Integrated Definition Modeling Language of IDEFO. The IDEFO method is used for defining compatibility measures based on each of the four constituent arrows that show inputs, controls, outputs, and mechanisms (ICOM). In this extension, the control constituents are replaced with constraints. Each of the ICOM constituents is expanded with parameters which include metrics and values. The ICOMs with their parameters and metrics are then used to characterize two or more subsystems in a matrix format. The differences between these matrices are entered into the sparse "Delta Matrix" which shows analysts the differences between the systems. These differences can be assigned to the appropriate levels of technical expertise to be analyzed and to determine feasibility of the child subsystem in the parent system. The process is compared to current practices in government unmanned aircraft system program offices to determine the usefulness of adopting this <b>compatibility</b> <b>assessment</b> process. This dissertation outlines the need for and development of the method for application by practitioners responsible for replacing subsystems on legacy systems. The development includes evaluations of the method and an experiment with cohorts of student system engineers to compare the output of the <b>Compatibility</b> <b>Assessment</b> Method to less-structured methods. This research contributes additional insight into system architecting theory and proposes a structured method for practitioners to use to improve the processes to perform part replacement in legacy systems.

30|$|The {{adoption}} of social entrepreneurship by any organization in any location always succumbs to challenges. According {{to the theory}} of Diffusion of Innovations, organizations face more complex adoption possibilities because organizations are both the aggregate of its individuals and its own system with a set of procedures and norms (Greenhalgh et al., 2004). Three organizational characteristics match well with the individual characteristics above: tension for change (motivation and ability), innovation-system fit (<b>compatibility),</b> and <b>assessment</b> of the implications (observability). Organizations can feel pressured by a tension for change. If the organization’s situation is untenable, it will be motivated to adopt an innovation to change its fortunes.

40|$|Peak {{events of}} {{unsteady}} total pressure and swirl distortion generated within S-duct intakes {{can affect the}} engine stability, even when within acceptable mean distortion levels. Even though the distortion descriptors have been evaluated in S-duct intakes, the associated flow field pattern has not been reported in detail. This is of importance since engine tolerance to distortion is usually tested with representative patterns from intake tests replicated with steady distortion generators. Despite its importance in intake/engine <b>compatibility</b> <b>assessments,</b> the spectral characteristics of the distortion descriptors {{and the relationship between}} peak unsteady swirl and both radial and circumferential total pressure distortion has not been assessed previously. The peak distortion data is typically low-pass filtered at a frequency associated with the minimum response time of the engine. However the engine design is not always known a priori in intakes investigations and a standard approach to reporting peak distortion data is needed. In addition, expensive and time-consuming tests are usually required to capture representative extreme distortion levels. This work presents a range of analyses based on Delayed Detached-Eddy Simulation and Stereo Particle Image Velocimetry data to assess these aspects of the unsteady flow distortion. The distorted pattern associated with different swirl distortion metrics is identified based on a conditional averaging technique, which indicates that the most intense swirl events are associated with a single rotating structure.. The main frequencies of the flow distortion descriptors in a representative S-duct intake are found to lie within the range in which the engine stability may be compromised. The peak total pressure and swirl distortion events are found to be not synchronous, which highlights the need to assess both types of distortion. Peak swirl and total-pressure distortion data is reported as a function of its associated time scale in a more general way {{that can be used in}} the assessment of intake unsteady flow distortion. Extreme Value Theory has been applied to predict peak distortion values beyond those measured in the available dataset, and whose measurement would otherwise require testing times two orders of magnitude longer than those typically considered...|$|R
40|$|The <b>assessment</b> of <b>compatibility</b> in frontal impacts has {{to address}} the {{importance}} of different vehicle structures. A critical component in the assessment is to identify, quantitatively, what constitutes good performing structures. In particular, the concepts of structural alignment and structural interaction need to be investigated. Structural alignment is incorporated in the FIMCAR candidate <b>compatibility</b> <b>assessments</b> to achieve geometric alignment of identifiable crashworthiness structures. Structural interaction is also a global assessment of how structures interact with a collision partner during the crash. The performance of lower vehicle structures in a crash {{has been identified as}} important as they may not be evaluated in a structural alignment assessment, but can contribute to structural interaction and thereby improve collision outcome. There has been, however, no clear definition of the characteristics for lower load paths that improve vehicle safety and how these structures manifest themselves in proposed test procedures. FIMCAR has developed a vehicle crash test program that investigates the performance of vehicle structures using three different test series. The first test series used Super mini vehicles with different front end architectures. These tests with, and without, geometric alignment allowed the effectiveness of a lower load path to be compared to a case without a lower load path. A second set of tests investigated the importance of lower load paths for SUV type vehicles where the main front structures may not align with the main structures in a collision partner, but a lower load path may offset the consequences of this initial misalignment. A final test series investigated how the lower load paths in higher SUV type vehicles influence safety in side impact conditions and thus identify potential side effects of a new assessment procedure. Results of the test program show that the presence of a lower load path contributes to a more robust performance of the vehicle. The rearward offset of a lower load path could be reviewed and used to quantify when a lower structure design can contribute to structural interaction in both frontal and side impact configurations...|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of the}} FIMCAR (Frontal Impact and <b>Compatibility</b> <b>Assessment</b> Research) {{project was}} to propose a frontal impact {{assessment}} approach addressing self- and partner protection. Research strategies and priorities were based on earlier research programs and the FIMCAR accident data analysis looking at modern cars. The identified real world safety issues – such as structural interaction (especially under-/override), high acceleration loading of the occupant especially in large overlap accidents and insufficient horizontal and vertical load spreading were used for evaluating the different test candidates. In addition to the issues mentioned above, the FIMCAR accident analysis suggested that frontal force compartment integrity matching is less of an issue as originally expected. FIMCAR developed a car-to-car test program that investigated the performance of vehicle structures. Results of the test program show {{that the presence of}} a lower load path contributes to a more robust performance of the vehicle. The rearward offset of a lower load path could be reviewed and used to quantify when a lower structure design can contribute to structural interaction in both frontal and side impact configurations. In addition to the car crash test programme, numerical models of actual cars and barriers were developed and used. As car-to-car simulations with models of different car manufacturers are almost impossible because of confidentiality, Parametric Car Models (PCM) and Generic Car Models (GCM) were developed. Due to the parametric design of the PCMs it is possible to modify the models in an easy and fast way. The GCMs model virtual cars which represent an average real car of the respective category in a comparable way to the OEM models. Within the FIMCAR project, different frontal impact test candidates were analysed regarding their potential for future frontal impact legislation. The research activities focused on car-to-car frontal impact. Test procedures were developed with both a crash test programme and numerical simulations. This analysis resulted in the combination of the Full Width Deformable Barrier test (FWDB) with compatibility metrics and the existing Offset Deformable Barrier (ODB) as described in UN-ECE Regulation 94 with additional cabin integrity requirement as being proposed as the FIMCAR assessment approach. The advantages of the FWDB compared to the rigid wall are the more representative pulse and deformation pattern as well as the better assessment of load paths. The introduction of a (M) PDB without compatibility metrics (that FIMCAR was unable to deliver in time) was considered as not being appropriate. The proposed frontal impact assessment approach addresses many of the issues identified by the FIMCAR consortium (impact alignment, high acceleration pulse loading, maintenance of compartment strength requirements, etc.) but not all frontal impact and compatibility issues could be addressed (load spreading). A benefit analysis estimated the benefit of the following three options: no change, introduction of full width test with <b>compatibility</b> <b>assessment</b> in addition to current ECE R 94 and introduction of full width test with <b>compatibility</b> <b>assessment</b> and replacement of current ODB test by PDB test with load spreading metric. The comparison of calculated break even costs for option 2 with estimated costs for achieving the benefit from previous projects suggests a positive cost benefit ratio.

Land use planning is a subdivision of urban planning which tends to arrange land uses in order to avoid conflicts among them. In order to achieve a transparent and effective urban planning, land uses should be located and allocated in an ideal situation so that avoid negative impacts from neighbouring parcels and land uses. Neighbouring land uses can produce externalities and negative impacts on other land uses because of inter-land use interaction.

The calculations of ecological <b>compatibility</b> <b>assessment</b> of objects under the study based on presented methods were done using the software that automated the complex systems state analysis. ????????? ????? ?????? ? ?????? ????????? ????????-??????????? ???????? ? ??????? ??????????? ????????, ??????? ?????????? ?? ?????? ????????????? ?????????????. ???????????? ??????????????? ??????????? ?????????? ??????????? ????????????? ????????????? ????????????? ?? ???????????? ?????? ????????????? ???????-?????????-????????????? ??????, ??????????? ?????????????? ?????? ????????? ????????? ????????. ?? ?????? ????????????? ?????? ??????? ??????? ???????-????????????? ?????? ?? ???????????? ?????????????? ????????? ? ??????????? ?????? ????????????? ?????????? ??????????? ???????? ????????? ? ????????????? ?????????? ????????????????? ???????? ??????. ??????? ?????? ????????????? ????????????? ???????? ?? ?????????????? ???????? ????????? ?? ?????? ???????????? ???????????, ??????? ????????? ???????????????? ?????? ????????? ??????? ??????...|$|E
50|$|Organizations {{face more}} complex {{adoption}} possibilities because organizations are both {{the aggregate of}} its individuals and its own system {{with a set of}} procedures and norms. Three organizational characteristics match well with the individual characteristics above: tension for change (motivation and ability), innovation-system fit (<b>compatibility),</b> and <b>assessment</b> of implications (observability). Organizations can feel pressured by a tension for change. If the organization's situation is untenable, it will be motivated to adopt an innovation to change its fortunes. This tension often plays out among its individual members. Innovations that match the organization's pre-existing system require fewer coincidental changes and are easy to assess {{are more likely to be}} adopted. The wider environment of the organization, often an industry, community, or economy, exerts pressures on the organization, too. Where an innovation is diffusing through the organization's environment for any reason, the organization is more likely to adopt it. Innovations that are intentionally spread, including by political mandate or directive, are also likely to diffuse quickly.|$|R
40|$|Nanocellulose has {{received}} considerable interest {{during the last}} decade because it is renewable and biodegradable, and has excellent mechanical properties, nanoscale dimensions and wide functionalization possibilities. It {{is considered to be a}} unique and versatile platform on which new functional materials can be based. This thesis focuses on nanocellulose from wood (NFC) and from Cladophora algae (CNC), functionalized with surface charges or coated with the conducting polymer polypyrrole (PPy), aiming to study the influence of synthesis processes on structural and electrochemical properties of such materials and assess their biocompatibility. The most important results of the work demonstrated that 1) CNC was oxidized to the same extent using electrochemical TEMPO-mediated oxidation as with conventional TEMPO processes, which may facilitate easier reuse of the reaction medium; 2) NFC and CNC films with or without surface charges were non-cytotoxic as assessed by indirect in vitro testing. Anionic TEMPO-CNC films promoted fibroblast adhesion and proliferation in direct in vitro cytocompatibility testing, possibly due to its aligned fibril structure; 3) Rinsing of PPy-coated nanocellulose fibrils, which after drying into free-standing porous composites are applicable for energy storage and electrochemically controlled ion extraction, significantly degraded the PPy coating, unless acidic rinsing was employed. Only minor degradation was observed during long-term ambient storage; 4) Variations in the drying method as well as type and amount of nanocellulose offered ways of tailoring the porosities of nanocellulose/PPy composites between 30 % and 98 %, with increments of ~ 10 %. Supercritical CO 2 -drying generated composites with the largest specific surface area yet reported for nanocellulose/conducting polymer composites (246 m 2 /g). The electrochemical oxidation rate was found to be controlled by the composite porosity; 5) In blood <b>compatibility</b> <b>assessments</b> for potential hemodialysis applications, heparinization of CNC/PPy composites was required to obtain thrombogenic properties comparable to commercial hemodialysis membranes. The pro-inflammatory characteristics of non-heparinized and heparinized composites were, to some extent, superior to commercial membranes. The heparin coating did not affect the solute extraction capacity of the composite. The presented results are deemed to be useful for tuning the properties of systems based on the studied materials in e. g. energy storage, ion exchange and biomaterial applications...|$|R
40|$|Operation of {{switchgear}} {{equipment in}} high voltage substations {{results in the}} propagation of transient currents in bus bars. The bus bars temporarily act as antennae, producing transient electromagnetic fields within the substations. With {{the introduction of new}} technology (microelectronics) into the substations for measurement and control purposes, there is renewed interest in the assessment of the electromagnetic environment of substations to ensure electromagnetic <b>compatibility.</b> This <b>assessment</b> is gaining increased importance as new equipment could be located very close to the switch being operated, potentially making the electronic equipment more vulnerable to disturbance. This paper discusses the prediction of transient electromagnetic field emissions due to switching operations in a typical 400 kV air insulated substation using the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method. Electromagnetic fields radiated by bus bars due to transient currents during switching were evaluated at various positions within the substation. The effects of adjacent substation equipment and of ground conditions on the radiated fields were also investigated. Finally the dominant frequency components of the radiated fields were identified and were found to be in general agreement with measured values...|$|R
