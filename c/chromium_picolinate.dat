Methods: Sixteen overweight men (BMI = 31. 1 +/- 3. 0 kg. m) {{were randomly assigned to}} supplement with 600 microg. d <b>chromium</b> as <b>picolinate</b> (Cr; N = 8) or a placebo (Pl; N = 8). After 4 wk of supplementation, subjects performed a supramaximal bout of cycling exercise to deplete muscle glycogen, which was followed by high-glycemic carbohydrate feedings for the next 24 h. Muscle biopsies were obtained at rest, immediately after exercise, and 2 and 24 h after exercise. Results: Elevations in glucose and insulin during recovery were not different, but the lactate response was significantly higher in Cr. There was a significant depletion in glycogen immediately after exercise, an increase at 2 h, and a further increase above rest at 24 h (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). The rate of glycogen synthesis during the 2 h after exercise was not different between groups (Cr: 25. 8 +/- 8. 0 and Pl: 17. 1 +/- 4. 7 mmol. kg. h). Glycogen synthase activity was significantly increased immediately after exercise in both groups. Muscle phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 -kinase) activity decreased immediately after exercise and increased at 2 h (P 3 ̆c 0. 05), with a trend for a lower PI 3 -kinase response in Cr (P = 0. 08). Conclusions: Chromium supplementation did not augment glycogen synthesis during recovery from high-intensity exercise and high-carbohydrate feeding, although there was a trend for lower PI 3 -kinase activity...|$|R

50|$|Literature {{review by}} Broadhurst and Domenico, made earlier than Balk's and Kleefstra's work, {{is much more}} optimistic for Cr efficacy, {{in the form of}} <b>chromium</b> <b>picolinate,</b> Cr(Pic)3, for the {{treatment}} of type 2 diabetes. Thirteen of the 15 clinical trials (11 of which were randomized and controlled) with a total of 1 690 subjects (1 505 treated with Cr(Pic3), reported at least one positive outcome in glycemic control parameters. Various positive effects were combined with the reduced need to use other hypoglycemic (glucose reduction) medication, such as other Cr formulations and conventional medicine. The current review gives a reduction in the HbA1c levels of 0.95% from 10 trials. This represents a significant risk reduction because, a ~1% drop equates to a 37% reduced risk of microvascular complications, and a 21% reduced risk of diabetes-related death. The authors argue that the apparent lack of effect in other literature reviews, is due to the reviews combining disparate treatment formulations rather than discretely separating them. This appears to be a problem encountered in the review by Balk and colleagues.|$|E
50|$|One {{study by}} Wang, Y. and Yao using {{engineered}} insulin-resistant adipocytes, showed that <b>chromium</b> <b>picolinate,</b> Cr(pic)3, increased glucose uptake, metabolism and increased GLUT4 translocation, {{but it had}} no effect on the studied mRNA levels (insulin receptor β or IR-β, Akt, c-Cbl, extracellular signal-regulated kinase or ERK, c-Jun phosphorylation and c-Cbl-associated protein or CAP). The mode of action was hypothesized to be through chromium interacting with p38 MAPK (p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases). In a different study by Wang, H. and colleagues, engineered Chinese hamster ovary cells were incubated with either Cr(pic)3, Cr-histidine complex, or CrCl3. It was found that the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity was activated at low insulin doses in the presence of Cr. Only the Cr-histidine activated receptors were tested for Cr concentration dependence, which was observed to exist. There were also no changes in the phosphorylation of the insulin receptors. It was concluded that cellular Cr somehow enhanced receptor kinase activity. In a study by Hao and colleagues, engineered skeletal muscle cells were tested. Using oligosaccharide oligomannuonate, Cr(III) complexes derived from algae, it showed that Cr did enhance the phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and also, that of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and Akt.|$|E

Objective: To compare the effects of <b>chromium</b> <b>picolinate</b> vs. metformin in clomiphen citrate resistant PCOS patients. Materials and Methods: The present randomized clinical trial was performed on 92 women with clomiphen citrate-resistant PCOS at the clinics which were affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran. The subjects {{were randomly assigned to}} two groups receiving either <b>chromium</b> <b>picolinate</b> (200 μg daily) or metformin (1500 mg daily) for 3 months. Anthropometric and hormonal profile were measured and compared {{both before and after the}} treatment. Ovulation and pregnancy rate was measured in the two study groups, as well. Results: <b>Chromium</b> <b>picolinate</b> significantly decreased fasting blood sugar (FBS) after 3 months of treatment (p= 0. 042). In the same way, the serum levels of fasting insulin had significantly decreased leading to an increase in insulin sensitivity as measured by QUICKI index (p= 0. 014). In comparison to the patients who received <b>chromium</b> <b>picolinate,</b> those who received metformin had significantly lower levels of testosterone (p= 0. 001) and free testosterone (p= 0. 001) after 3 months of treatment. Nevertheless, no significant difference was found between the two study groups regarding ovulation (p= 0. 417) and pregnancy rates (p= 0. 500). Conclusion: <b>Chromium</b> <b>picolinate</b> decreased FBS and insulin levels and, thus, increased insulin sensitivity in clomiphene citrate-resistance PCOS women.

40|$|Background: Type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus is a chronic disease {{that has been}} increasing in prevalence in the United States every year. Diabetes is associated with numerous physical health complications, most notably the development of cardiovascular disease. In addition, the financial burden imposed by diabetes is great and includes medical costs and lost work time. Most patients with diabetes take prescription oral anti-diabetic medications (OADs) but still do not have adequate glycemic control. When adequate glycemic control is not achieved with these medications, injectable insulin is then required; {{it is understandable that}} patients object to this type of invasive treatment and would prefer to remain on oral therapies. Over-the-counter dietary supplements, specifically <b>chromium</b> <b>picolinate</b> and biotin, have been studied for their efficacy as glycemic control agents; the purpose of this metasynthesis was to review existing literature pertaining to concurrent use of both <b>chromium</b> <b>picolinate</b> and biotin supplements as adjunct therapy to prescription OADs to determine if improved glycemic control is achieved in patients with type 2 {{diabetes mellitus}}. Methods: An exhaustive search was conducted using Medline-OVID, CINAHL, and Web of Science using the keywords: diabetes, <b>chromium</b> <b>picolinate</b> and biotin. Relevant articles were assessed for quality using the GRADE system. A search on the NIH clinical trials site revealed there are no trials currently registered relating to the concomitant use of <b>chromium</b> <b>picolinate</b> and biotin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Results: Ninety-six articles were reviewed for relevancy; two met inclusion criteria and were included in this systematic review. Both studies included were randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trials that found a statistically significant improvement in glycemic control with dual <b>chromium</b> <b>picolinate</b> and biotin treatment. Conclusion: <b>Chromium</b> <b>picolinate</b> and biotin appear to modestly improve glycemic control. <b>Chromium</b> <b>picolinate</b> and biotin are safe, over-the-counter supplements; due to evidence obtained from prior animal studies, the lack of significant adverse drug reactions and modest-to-substantial blood-glucose reducing effects, <b>chromium</b> <b>picolinate</b> and biotin supplementation as adjunct therapy to prescription OADs may be clinically justified...|$|E

However, toxicity associated with such chromium compounds has compromised their therapeutic value. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the impact of a newly synthesized complex of chromium with phenylalanine, Cr(pa) 3 on insulin-signaling and glucose tolerance. Cr(pa) 3 was synthesized by chelating chromium(III) with d-phenylalanine ligand in aqueous solution. In mouse 3 T 3 -adipocytes, Cr(pa) 3 augmented insulin-stimulated glucose-uptake as assessed by a radioactive-glucose uptake assay. At the molecular level, Cr(pa) 3 enhanced insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt in a time- and concentration-dependent manner without altering the phosphorylation of insulin receptor. Oral treatment with Cr(pa) 3 (150 μg/kg/d, for six weeks) in ob/ob(+/+) obese mice significantly alleviated glucose tolerance compared with untreated obese mice.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effects of different levels of zinc sulfate and <b>chromium</b> <b>picolinate</b> on the performance, immune response and meat quality of Japanese quails under heat stress condition. The birds (n = 540; 7 -d-old) were randomly assigned to 9 treatment groups consisting of 3 replicates of 20 birds each in a 3 × 3 factorial arrangement of treatments [zinc (0, 40, 80 mg/Kg); chromium (0, 500, 1000 μg/Kg) ]. Birds were kept in floor cages in a temperature controlled room and subjected to heat stress for 8 h/d (9. 00 to 17. 00) from 7 d {{to the end of the}} study. Zn was supplemented to the basal diet as ZnSO 4 and Cr as <b>chromium</b> <b>picolinate.</b> A linear decrease in feed intake and an improvement in feed conversion ratio were found by supplementing Zn and Cr to the quails diets. Chromium supplementation increased daily weight gain linearly. By  increasing the level of dietary Zn and Cr in the diet, heterophil to lymphocyte ratio and meat quality parameters were improved linearly. The results of this study revealed positive effects of Zn and Cr supplementation on the performance, immune responses and meat quality of quails under heat stress condition. It seems that supplementation of the quail's diets with 80 mg/Kg Zn and 1000 mg/Kg Cr can be greatly helpful for improving the adverse effects of heat stress...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effects of different levels nanoparticles of <b>chromium</b> <b>picolinate</b> (NanoCrPic) on the performance, immune responses, mineral retention, and tissues accumulation of chickens. A total of 180 broilers were randomly allocated into 0 (control), 500 ppb (µg kg - 1) Cr and 3000 ppb Cr groups with 6 replicates (10 birds/pen) for a 35 -day experiment, the Cr is nanoparticles of <b>chromium</b> <b>picolinate</b> (NanoCrPic). In addition, 36 birds were used for metabolic experimental investigation. The results of the experimentation indicated that {{there were no significant differences}} in average body weight gain between groups, but feed conversion ratio (FCR) in 3000 ppb group was better than control group during 1 - 21 days. The carcass yields slightly lower in 3000 ppb group than control (p< 0. 1). Retention ratio of Zn, Fe, Mn, Ca, and P were significantly (p< 0. 05) increased in the 500 ppb Cr group. The addition of NanoCrPic caused increased mineral concentrations, such as Cr, Ca and P in the subjects’ livers. Furthermore, the addition of NanoCrPic significantly increased lymphocytes and decreased both heterophils and H/L ratio (p< 0. 05). The ND (Newcastle disease) antibody titer was not affected in the broilers. In conclusion, supplemental NanoCrPic improved the retention of Zn, Fe Ca, notably it increased the concentration of Cr and Ca in the liver, and also increased the number of lymphocytes in broiler chickens. </p...|$|E
