5|$|Duration: For most goods, {{the longer}} a price change holds, {{the higher the}} {{elasticity}} is likely to be, {{as more and more}} consumers find they have the time and inclination to search for substitutes. When fuel prices increase suddenly, for instance, consumers may still fill up their empty tanks in the short run, but when prices remain high over several years, more <b>consumers</b> <b>will</b> reduce their demand for fuel by switching to carpooling or public transportation, investing in vehicles with greater fuel economy or taking other measures. This does not hold for consumer durables such as the cars themselves, however; eventually, it may become necessary for consumers to replace their present cars, so one would expect demand to be less elastic.|$|E
5|$|Economists have {{observed}} that consumers tend to travel more when their cars are more fuel efficient, causing a 'rebound' in the demand for fuel. An increase in the efficiency with which a resource (e.g. fuel) is used, causes {{a decrease in the}} cost of using that resource when measured in terms of what it can achieve (e.g. travel). Generally speaking, a decrease in the cost (or price) of a good or service will increase the quantity demanded (the law of demand). With a lower cost for travel, <b>consumers</b> <b>will</b> travel more, increasing the demand for fuel. This increase in demand is known as the rebound effect, and {{it may or may not}} be large enough to offset the original drop in demand from the increased efficiency. The Jevons paradox occurs when the rebound effect is greater than 100%, exceeding the original efficiency gains.|$|E

25|$|The first {{business}} model that dissuades illegal file sharing {{is to make}} downloading digital media easy and cheap. The use of noncommercial sites makes downloading digital media complex. For example, misspelling an artist's name in a search query will often fail to return a result, and some sites limit internet traffic, which can make downloading media a long and frustrating process. Furthermore, some illegal file sharing websites are host to viruses and malware which attach themselves to the files (see torrent poisoning).If digital media (for example, songs) are all provided on accessible, legitimate sites, and are reasonably priced, <b>consumers</b> <b>will</b> purchase media legally to overcome these frustrations.|$|E

50|$|There {{is a model}} {{described}} by Lars Perner which illustrates the decision making process with regards to consumer behavior. It begins with recognition of a problem, the consumer recognises a need or want {{which has not been}} satisfied. This leads the consumer to search for information, if it is a low involvement product then the search will be internal, identifying alternatives purely from memory. If the product is high involvement then the search be more thorough, such as reading reviews or reports or asking friends. The <b>consumer</b> <b>will</b> then evaluate his or her alternatives, comparing price, quality, doing trade-offs between products and narrowing down the choice by eliminating the less appealing products until there is one left. After this has been identified, the <b>consumer</b> <b>will</b> purchase the product. Finally the <b>consumer</b> <b>will</b> evaluate the purchase decision, and the purchased product, bringing in factors such as value for money, quality of goods and purchase experience (Model taken from Perner, 2008).|$|R

2500|$|The {{behavioral}} {{assumption of}} the consumer theory proposed herein is that all consumers seek to maximize utility. In the mainstream economics tradition, this activity of maximizing utility has been deemed as the [...] "rational" [...] behavior of decision makers. More specifically, {{in the eyes of}} economists, all consumers seek to maximize a utility function subject to a budgetary constraint. In other words, economists assume that <b>consumers</b> <b>will</b> always choose the [...] "best" [...] bundle of goods they can afford. Consumer theory is therefore based around the problem of generate refutable hypotheses about the nature of consumer demand from this behavioral postulate.|$|E
2500|$|The law {{of demand}} {{states that the}} rate of {{consumption}} falls as the price of the good rises, even when the consumer is monetarily compensated for the effect of the higher price; this is called the substitution effect. As the price of a good rises, <b>consumers</b> <b>will</b> substitute away from that good, choosing [...] more of other alternatives. If no compensation for the price rise occurs, as is usual, then the decline in overall purchasing power due to the price rise leads, for most goods, to a further decline in the quantity demanded; this is called the income effect.|$|E

2500|$|In {{consumer}} markets, {{another key}} strategic level decision {{is whether to}} use a push or pull strategy. In a push strategy, the marketer uses intensive advertising and incentives aimed at distributors, especially retailers and wholesalers, {{with the expectation that}} they will stock the product or brand, and that <b>consumers</b> <b>will</b> purchase it when they see it in stores. In contrast, in a pull strategy, the marketer promotes the product directly to consumers hoping that they will pressure retailers to stock the product or brand, thereby pulling it through the distribution channel. [...] The choice of a push or pull strategy has important implications for advertising and promotion. In a push strategy the advertising media would normally be weighted towards trade magazines, exhibitions and trade shows while a pull strategy would make more extensive use of consumer-oriented media such as newspapers, magazines, television and radio.|$|E
2500|$|Sarkar‘s {{economic}} system rests upon {{the concept of}} a tiered economic structure in which the production and distribution of goods is performed according to three distinctive business models [...] During his lifetime, he classifies and clarifies the need for these models which are; medium-scale worker-owned cooperatives, small-scale privately owned businesses and government-run large scale key industries. Sarkar justifies this economic structure by claiming that there are fundamental strengths and weaknesses embedded in each style of business which makes them more suitable for specific industries and scales of operation [...] Cooperatives, he understood, are desirable for the majority of enterprises [...] This claim has been given since that by working together and taking hold of the means of production, cooperative workers and <b>consumers</b> <b>will</b> be safeguarded against different forms of economic exploitation, offering no scope for intermediaries to interfere with their business. However, key industries vital {{to the development of the}} country and of strategic importance (such as electrical utilities or the railway system), should be run by the immediate local government. He justified this idea by claiming that these industries are to complex and large scale to be run effectively by a cooperative. Finally, Sarkar defends that small businesses can be privately owned and managed. Enterprises with few employees such as family businesses are encouraged to be self-managed. Sarkarian thought sees that some people have economic dreams that are more individual in nature and hence not suitable to be constrained by collective interests.|$|E
