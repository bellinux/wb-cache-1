40|$|Passive {{intrinsic}} bistability is {{of great}} interest. Our Fabry-Perot interference filters exhibit bistability due to a temperature dependent refractive index. Operating across the entire viable spectrum permits wide application to the demonstration and development of concepts for optical computing. Thermal evaporation of zinc sulfide and <b>chiolite</b> is used to produce Fabry-Perot interference filters. The effect of {{the thickness of the}} spacer, and reflectivities of the mirrors, on the nonlinear characteristics of these devices is investigated. The mathematic description of these etalon's linear, as well as their nonlinear, behavior is presented. The experimental apparatus is described.

40|$|Solidification of {{cryolite}} (Na 3 AlF 6) -based bath {{takes place}} at different rates along the sideledge, and around alumina rafts and new anodes. The solidification rate has {{a significant impact on}} the structure and the chemical composition that determine the thermal conductivity and thus the thickness of sideledge, or the duration of the existence of the temporary frozen bath layers in other cases. Unfortunately, samples that can be collected in industrial cells are formed under unknown, spatially and temporally varying conditions. For this reason, frozen bath samples were created under different heat flux conditions in a well-controlled laboratory environment using the so-called cold finger technique. The samples were analyzed by X-ray Diffractometer (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) in Back Scattering (BS) mode in order to obtain spatial distribution of chemical composition. Results were correlated with structural analysis. XRD confirmed our earlier hypothesis of recrystallization of cryolite to <b>chiolite</b> under medium heat flux regime. Lower α-alumina, and higher γ-alumina content in the samples obtained with very high heating rate suggest that fast cooling reduces α–γ conversion. In accordance with the expectation, SEM-BS revealed significant variation of the Na/Al ratio in the transient sampl...|$|E
40|$|In an {{aluminum}} electrolysis cell, the side ledge forms on side walls {{to protect it}} from the corrosive cryolitic bath. In this study, a series of laboratory analogue experiments have been carried out to investigate the microstructure and composition of side ledge (freeze linings) at different heat balance steady states. Three distinct layers are found in the freeze linings formed in the designed Cryolite-CaF 2 -AlF 3 -Al 2 O 3 electrolyte system: a closed (columnar) crystalline layer, an open crystalline layer, and a sealing layer. This layered structure changes when the heat balance is shifted between different steady states, by melting or freezing the open crystalline layer. Phase chemistry of the freeze lining is studied in this paper to understand the side ledge formation process upon heat balance shifts. Electron probe X-ray microanalysis (EPMA) is used to characterize the microstructure and compositions of distinct phases existing in the freeze linings, which are identified as cryolite, <b>chiolite,</b> Ca-cryolite, and alumina. A freeze formation mechanism is further developed based on these microstructural/compositional investigations and also thermodynamic calculations through the software-FactSage. It is found that entrapped liquid channels exist in the open crystalline layer, assisting with the mass transfer between solidified crystals and bulk molten bath...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} solid state NMR {{experiments}} {{on a variety}} of minerals and glasses are described with the aim of studying the dependence of their structure on the chemical composition. Chapter 1 introduces the reader to the subject. Chapter 2 describes 23 Na and 27 Al NMR experiments on a number of alkali fluoroaluminates. These substances consist of AIF 6 octahedra which can be linked together to form a variety of structures, similar {{to the way in which}} Si 04 and AI 04 tetrahedra are linked together in aluminosilicates. The 23 Na and 27 Al chemical shifts correlate well with the type of structure. AIF 3 is a network structure and has the most negative 27 Al chemical shift (- 16 ppm). The chemical shift increases from - 3 and - 1 ppm in the sheet structure <b>chiolite</b> (NasAI 3 F 14) to 0 ppm in cryolite (N AIF 6) ' The 23 Na chemical shift is dependent of the number of fluorines coordinating Na: Na in an NaF 6 group has a more positive chemical shift than Na in NaFs. Additionally, 27 Al chemical shifts for oxides are shown to be at least 20 ppm less shielded than those in similar fluorides. Chapter 3 studies pentameric (Si,Al) s 016 groups with (almost) straight intertetrahedral AI-O-Si angles in a zunyite with excess Al and in harkerite. The excess Al in the zunyite lattice is shown to occupy the central tetrahedral Si(l) site. The 27 Al chemical shift correlation with the AI-O-Si angle is extended to 1760 Chapter 4 reports the first application of off-resonance nutation spectroscopy to five alkali aluminosilicate glasses. These glasses have a chemical composition similar to that of a granite, with the alkali's replaced by Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs. Off-resonance nutation spectroscopy, newly developed at the HF-NMR facility in Nijmegen, proves to be very powerful in determining the quadrupole interaction and subsequently the isotropic chemical shifts for Al in these glasses. The quadrupole interaction and the chemical shift decrease when the size of the charge-balancing counterion increases. The correlation of the 27 Al chemical shift with the AI-O-Si angle for framework aluminosilicate structures (see also chapter 3) is used to show, that the size of the alkali ion determines the size of the rings building up the glasses. Since the quadrupole interaction for Al is linearly correlated with the polarising power of the alkali ion, the aluminium and the alkali ions are believed to be closely bound. This is supported by a theoretical ionic model predicting this correlation. Chapter 5 investigates the use of corundum (a-AI 20 3) as a standard in quantatative NMR measurements. As AI is a quadrupolar nucleus, a number of requirements have to be fullfilled in order to obtain reliable results. Most importantly, only the central transition is excited by using a very short rf pulse in order to be in the region of linear response. The intensities of five natural and synthetic corundum samples are compared. Despite the fact that all experimental conditions are identical and in the linear region, the intensities differ considerably. A synthetic corundum obtained by heating Al(OH) 3 has the highest intensity, close to the expected value, but the other samples have much too low intensities. Relaxation effects are shown to be responsible for this. It is proposed, that only in case of a wellcharacterized corundum sample without impurities a-A 120 3 can be used as a standard for quantitative NMR measurements...|$|E
40|$|A partir del diagrama de estabilidad determinado por FOSTER(1960) para el sistema Al 2 O 3 - Na 3 AlF 6, y aplicando algunas leyes y normas que regulan la cristalización en soluciones acuosas, se ha desarrollado un procedimiento teórico que permite modelizar {{el comportamiento}} de dicho sistema, durante su proceso de cristalización, en forma de corindón y criolita, mediante la técnica conocida comúnmente como "flux growth" (disolución no acuosa de alta temperatura). Los datos empleados para llevar a cabo dicha modelización, se corresponden con las {{variables}} de entrada aplicadas en una serie de experimentos, realizados con esta técnica y con el mismo sistema. La concordancia entre los resultados experimentales obtenidos y las previsiones estimadas teóricamente, pone en evidencia la validez del procedimiento propuesto y constituye una nueva aportación para el conocimiento formal de los procesos implicados en dicha técnica de cristalización. [ABSTRACT] A procedure which allows to foresee theoretically the behaviour of the Al 203 -Na 3 AlF 6 system during its crystallisation process in corundum (AL 203) and cryolite (NA 3 ALF 6) forms by the technique {{commonly known as}} flux growth (high temperature solution) has been developed from ihe stability diagram detennined by FOSTER(1960). It {{has been carried out}} a series of experiments with the same technique and system. The entrance variables of these experiments have been used to develop the theoretical procedure. In all these experiments, corundum (A O) and cryolite (Na 3 AlF 6) crystals have been obtained. Rarely, diaoyudaoita (NaAl 11017) ' villiaumite (NaF) and <b>chiolite</b> (Na 5 Al 3 F 11) have also been obtained. The position which occupies these crystallme phases in the crucible shows the way in which its nueleation and their later growth have taken place: the phases located in the higher part of the crucible nueleated and grew in vapour phase, out of the flux, and the phases located in the lower part were done in solution. The initial alumina andcryolite concentration detennines the exelusive crystallisation of one or the other phase in their stability fields (before reaching the eutectic point). The initial concentration of alumina and cryolite, in relation to the initial temperature, detennines the temperature at which, the first nueleus, in each case, are created. The cryolite concentration in its interval of stability originates in all of the experiments already carried out a solid residue in which two levels of different composition are distinguished: the highest enriched with cryolite and the lowest enriched with corundum. The characteristics of the crystalline aggregates situated in this low level allow to differentiate two fonnation process: one characterized by continuous episodes of primary nueleation in which those nueleus do not increased its size and originate a cryptocrystalline material, and another one characterized by an only episode of heterogeneous nueleation which originates visible crystals in plates and micrometric density fonn. In the eutectic, all the phases which can be crystallised are developed from the components of the residualliquid as their respective equilibrium concentrations are being obtained. [...] - The position of the heating plates in the furnace determine the temperature gradient originated in the working chamber: if the temperature decreases towards the crucible basis, the nueleation of the vapour phase it is not favoured in the highest part of the crucible. Whereas, if the gradient is inverted, the nueleation of the vapour phase takes place in the highest part of the crucibles. This fact varies the proportion between the different components of the system and, in consequence, the theoretic ca 1 culations obtained from them can be fiddled. However, in spite of this possible desviations, it is made clear the concordance between the experimental results obtained and the forecasts theoretically estimated from the procedure proposed. The agreement between experimental and theoretical result supposes an advance for the formal knowledge of the crystallisation process through the "flux" technique...|$|E
