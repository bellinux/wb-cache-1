After testing the model against available data, we used it to address specific questions to understand the factors that control the observed diurnal cycle of air pollution in this urban basin in the Himalayas. We studied {{the dynamics of the}} basin's nocturnal <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>pool,</b> its dissipation in the morning, and the subsequent growth and decay of the mixed layer over the valley. During mornings, we found behavior common to large basins, with upslope flows and basin-center subsidence removing the nocturnal <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>pool.</b> During afternoons the circulation in the Kathmandu Valley exhibited patterns common to plateaus, with cooler denser air originating over lower regions west of Kathmandu arriving through mountain passes and spreading across the basin floor, thereby reducing the mixed layer depth. We also examined the pathways of pollutant ventilation out of the valley. The bulk of the pollution ventilation takes place during the afternoon, when strong westerly winds blow in through the western passes of the valley, and the pollutants are rapidly carried out through passes on the east and south sides of the valley. In the evening, pollutants first accumulate near the surface, but then are lifted slightly when katabatic flows converge underneath. The elevated polluted layers are mixed back down in the morning, contributing to the morning pollution peak. Later in the morning a fraction of the valley's pollutants travels up the slopes of the valley rim mountains before the westerly winds begin.

40|$|Abstract: After {{an outline}} of the {{scientific}} questions within FORM (Foehn study in the Rhine valley during MAP) some results are being discussed, which allow a deeper insight into the unstationary behavior of foehn in a complex Alpine valley. Due to an extremely dense and sophisticated instrumentation of in situ and remote sensing platforms the themodynamic and dynamic structure could be nicely investigated. It was clearly seen that the static stability within valleys may be quite complex, leading often to a three rather than two layer configuration. Simulations with different very high resolution models allow to derive the critical factors which determine {{the usefulness of the}} model with respect to local foehn prediction. Of special importance is the correct treatment of the shallow <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>pool.</b> Considering the scientific results so far obtained of the different types of foehn events during MAP-SOP (MAP Special Observing Period, 7 September – 15 November 1999) the FORM initiative {{can be seen as a}} very successful part of MAP...|$|E
40|$|Supplementary {{material}} {{included in}} separate file. This article was {{originally published in}} International Journal of Climatology and is copyrighted by the Royal Meteorological SocietyCold <b>air</b> drainage and <b>pooling</b> occur in many mountain valleys, especially at night and during winter. Local climate regimes associated with frequent <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>pooling</b> have substantial impacts on species phenology, distribution and diversity. However, {{little is known about}} how the degree and frequency of <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> drainage and <b>pooling</b> will respond to a changing climate. Evidence suggests that, because cold pools are decoupled from the free atmosphere, these local climates may not respond {{in the same way as}} regional-scale climates estimated from coarse-grid general circulation models. Indeed, recent studies have demonstrated that historical changes in the frequency of synoptic conditions have produced complex spatial variations in the resulting climatic changes on the ground. In the mountainous terrain of the Oregon Cascades, we show that, at relatively exposed hill slope and ridge top locations, air temperatures are highly coupled to changes in synoptic circulation patterns at the 700 -hPa level, whereas in sheltered valley bottoms, <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>pooling</b> at night and during winter causes temperatures to be largely decoupled from, and relatively insensitive to, 700 -hPa flow variations. The result is a complex temperature landscape composed of steep gradients in temporal variation, controlled largely by gradients in elevation and topographic position. When a projected climate warming of 2. 5 °C was combined with likely changes in the frequency distribution of synoptic circulation, modelled temperature changes at closely spaced locations diverged widely (by up to 6 °C), with differences equalling or exceeding that of the imposed regional temperature change. Because <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>pooling</b> and consequent atmospheric decoupling occur in many mountain valleys, especially at high latitudes, this phenomenon is likely to be an important consideration in understanding the impacts of climate change in mountainous regions...|$|R

40|$|In {{mountain}} areas, {{the use of}} coarse-grid reanalysis {{data for}} driving fine-scale models requires downscaling of near-surface (e. g., 2  m high) air temperature. Existing approaches describe lapse rates well but differ in how they include surface effects, i. e., {{the difference between the}} simulated 2  m and upper-air temperatures. We show that different treatment of surface effects result in some methods making better predictions in valleys while others are better in summit areas. We propose the downscaling method REDCAPP (REanalysis Downscaling <b>Cold</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Pooling</b> Parameterization) with a spatially variable magnitude of surface effects. Results are evaluated with observations (395 stations) from two mountain regions and compared with three reference methods. Our findings suggest that the difference between near-surface air temperature and pressure-level temperature (Δ T) is a good proxy of surface effects. It can be used with a spatially variable land-surface correction factor (LSCF) for improving downscaling results, especially in valleys with strong surface effects and <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>pooling</b> during winter.

These precipitations are influenced by monsoon system of India ocean. In these thesis, It was tried to evaluate the relation between thermal anomaly of sea surface in India ocean and Arab sea which effects on southeast monsoon precipitations of Iran, For evaluation of this happening in southeast, data were collected from 7 synoptic observation stations of Bandar Abbas, Minab, Kerman, Bam, Chabahar, Iranshahr, Zahedan and 17 rain gauge stations during June to September of each year from 1980 to 2010. Rainy days were determine and then some information about synoptic circulation models, maps of average pressure of sea surface, geopotential height of 700 hP surface, geopotential height of 500 hP surface, temperature of 850 hPa surface, humidity of 700 hPa surface, vertical velocity of 700 hPa surface, vertical velocity of 500 hP and humidity of 2 meters height for 6 systems were extracted from NCEP/NCAR website for evaluation. By evaluation of these systems it was determined that the monsoon low pressure system tab brings needed humidity of these precipitations to this region from India ocean and Arab sea with a vast circulation. It is seen that warm air pool locates on Iran and <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>pool</b> locates on west of India at 800 hPa surface. In a rainy day this warm air transfers to high latitudes and influences the temperature trough of southeast <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>pool</b> of the country. In the middle surfaces of 700 and 500 hPa, the connection between low height system above India and low height system above the higher latitudes causes the low height system above India to be strength and developed. By evaluation of humidity at 2 meters height and 700 hPa surface we observe that humidity Increases in the southeast region. With penetrating of the low height system of India above the 700 and 500 hPa surfaces of southeast of Iran, the value of negative omega (Rising vertical velocity) is increased. In the second pace, it was shown the evaluation of how the correlation between sea surface temperature anomaly in India Ocean and Arab sea influences southeast monsoon precipitation of Iran. For this purpose the data of water surface temperature anomaly of Arab sea and India ocean, the data of precipitation anomaly of 7 synoptic stations, mentioned above, and correlation coefficient among the data of precipitation anomaly and water surface temperature anomaly of Arab Sea, east and west of India ocean were calculated.

Maps were created using inverse distance weighting (IDW) as an extrapolation method in Arc GIS 10. 1. We found that temperature was dominated by lapse-rate, topographic shading, and <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>pooling</b> effects, depending on the time of year. Both minimum and maximum monthly temperature in spring (some Mar, April, May, and even June) and fall (Oct, Nov) tends to be lapse-rate dominated. Late summer (Aug, Sep, Oct) maximum temperature tends to be dominated by topographic shading, despite interannual variation in precipitation. <b>Cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>pooling</b> appeared in July, August, and September minimum temperature, but in maximum temperature only for a dry December (2011). Additional sensors (from 16 to 40 or even 56) increase the ability to identify topographic shading patterns and the associated heterogeneity in temperature, with weak indications of <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>pooling.</b> Even more sensors (from 40 / 56 to 166 / 182) increase the ability to identify very small scale variability, including cool <b>air</b> <b>pooling</b> in the main-stem valley of the Andrews Forest. For a given month, temperature spatial patterns were fairly consistent from one year to another. For a given month, temperature values between years vary with interannual variation in precipitation. Some sites in the Andrews Forest have a very large diurnal temperature range (mean monthly min to mean monthly max) while other sites have very small ranges. Sites close to each other may have very different mean monthly temperature, due to the effect of topography. Sites with the largest temperature ranges were on the south-facing slopes of Carpenter Mountain, and those with the smallest ranges were along the north-facing slope of the south side of Andrews Forest (Lookout Ridge) and northwest of the upper end of Lookout Creek. North-facing slopes on Lookout Mountain and Roswell Ridge may also have very small temperature ranges, but these areas were not instrumented. Sites with small temperature ranges may serve as refugia for organisms in response to climate change. For mountain environments subjected to climate change, these findings imply that different parts of the landscape experience climate change differently. There may be "refugia" from climate change in mountain landscapes, defined as locations with small diurnal and seasonal temperature ranges...|$|R

Ice caves are environments where permafrost and periglacial conditions exist in milder climates due to specific microclimatic setting. Surface air is entering the cave only when its temperature drops below the cave air temperature. This {{results in a}} formation of <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>pool,</b> which sustains a periglacial environment, permafrost and ice. Ice caves in karst can also contain a variety of sediments that were transported in a cave during its formation. These sediments can be subject to freeze-thaw cycles due to temperature fluctuations and form periglacial features. Ledena jama pod Hrušico cave is situated on the Hrušica plateau on the elevation of about 800 m. It consists of spacious 20 m deep shaft, debris cone and two small passages. The ice is still present in the debris cone and is quickly disappearing. One of the passages contains silty sediments, which are mixed with limestone debris. Sorted stripes are present on an inclined slope of this passage. Cave environment is less influenced by different subaerial processes thus cave environments are very suitable for controlled observations. Seven air temperature loggers were installed in order to monitor cave climate and identify processes responsible for periglacial conditions. Furthermore, we installed 12 soil temperature sensors {{in different parts of}} pattern ground to analyse the processes that lead to ground sorting.

The influence of topogr aphy and meteorology – A networkof air temperature data loggers {{was installed in}} the Serra da Estrela {{with the objective of}} studying the main air temperature patterns. Data was collected at 2 -hour intervals during 2000. A k-means analysis was used to classify the air temperatures and 4 typesof patterns were identified. Patterns 1 and 4 that occurred in 34 % of the records show cold air accumulation on valley floors. In Patterns 2 and 3 air temperature decreases with altitude (66 %). The control effect of the geographic and meteorological factors on the 4 temperature patterns was evaluated using one-way ANOVA. The results show that patterns 2 and 3 are related to unstable atmospheric conditions, with high wind speed and air humidity, and more intense vertical movement of the air (negative omega). On the contrary, the other two patterns are related to more stable atmospheric conditions (1 and 4). The more significant variables from the ANOVA were chosen for the discriminant function analysis. The results model correctly 74 % of the cases. The first function (71 %) discriminates nocturnal from diurnal events and the second (41 %), the atmospheric stability.

40|$|Nocturnal flows {{down the}} narrow Andean valleys within the western slope of the {{subtropical}} Andes (central Chile) are episodically enhanced by easterly downslope winds that flow into the Santiago basin over the radiatively cooled air above the surface. Local, regional, and large-scale data have been used here to characterize the mean features of these episodes. About 80 % of easterly downslope flow episodes in austral winter are forced by a reversal in the sea level pressure gradient {{along the coast of}} south-central Chile, when a midlatitude cold high migrates from southern Chile eastward across the Andes under midtroposphere SW winds associated with a warm ridge aloft. Under these circumstances low-level, easterly (offshore) flow sets in, producing a compensating downslope flow that subsides over central Chile. The remaining cases are associated with prefrontal conditions under a midlatitude trough with NW winds aloft. Since in most of these cases the easterly low-level flow occurs beneath westerly flow higher above, these episodes classify as strong windward downslope flows. Within the Andean valleys and canyons, the near-surface air experiences a sensible warming and drying at night and early morning during these episodes, as the strong downvalley winds tend to destroy the surface-based radiative inversion and mix down warmer air from aloft. At the exit region of these valleys into the central basin, these downslope flows in austral winter are not able to flush the <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>pool</b> there. Hence, dawn surface temperatures over the basin tend to be lower than average as clear skies and dry subsiding air aloft favor surface radiative cooling. The resulting enhancement of the near-surface static stability hampers the subsequent devel-opment of the mixed layer, leading to severe air pollution events in Santiago and other cities in central Chile. A comparative discussion on governing mechanisms with respect to apparently similar phenomena, as gap flow and shallow foehn, is included. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{katabatic}} wind events {{observed in the}} coastal zone of Adelie Land, Antarctica, on 27 November and 3 December 1985 are simulated with a hydrostatic mesoscale atmospheric model coupled to a snow moder. The diurnal cycle of insolation is strong. The main difference in the forcing between the two events is the large-scale wind, which is weak on 27 November and moderate on 3 December. In both cases temperature and wind are characterized by well-marked diurnal cycles. In particular, {{katabatic wind}}s blow during nighttime and upslope winds during daytime. In both cases the katabatic airstream slows down progressively over the ocean. Consequently, continental air piles up and this generates a {{pool of cold air}} responsible for a pressure gradient force opposing the katabatic wind. An amplification of the slowing down results. When, in the morning, insolation increases, the surface inversion weakens but the influence of the <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>pool</b> increases. The katabatic how starts to decay over the coastal zone and then retreats progressively toward the ice sheet interior. When the large-scale wind is weak, the surface warming is sufficient for generating an additional upslope bouyancy force, and anabatic flow develops over the ice sheet in the afternoon. When the large-scare wind is moderate and downslope, the pilling up of cold air is important and this has a dramatic impact on the flow. A sharp spatial transition is generated between downslope and upslope winds over the ocean. This discontinuity moves toward the ice sheet interior in the morning and is responsible for the sudden cessation of the katabatic flow seen by static observers. The results of the simulations are used in order to refine a simple parameterization of Antarctic katabatic winds...|$|E
40|$|Sodar (SOund Detection And Ranging), eddy-covariance, and tower profile {{measurements}} of wind speed {{and carbon dioxide}} were performed during 17 consecutive nights in complex terrain in northern Taiwan. The scope {{of the study was}} to identify the causes for intermittent turbulence events and to analyze their importance in nocturnal atmosphere–biosphere exchange as quantified with eddy-covariance measurements. If intermittency occurs frequently at a measurement site, then this process needs to be quantified in order to achieve reliable values for ecosystem characteristics such as net ecosystem exchange or net primary production. Fourteen events of intermittent turbulence were identified and classified into above-canopy drainage flows (ACDFs) and low-level jets (LLJs) according to the height of the wind speed maximum. Intermittent turbulence periods lasted between 30 and 110 min. Towards the end of LLJ or ACDF events, positive vertical wind velocities and, in some cases, upslope flows occurred, counteracting the general flow regime at nighttime. The observations suggest that the LLJs and ACDFs penetrate deep into the <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>pool</b> in the valley, where they experience strong buoyancy due to density differences, resulting in either upslope flows or upward vertical winds. Turbulence was found to be stronger and better developed during LLJs and ACDFs, with eddy-covariance data presenting higher quality. This was particularly indicated by spectral analysis of the vertical wind velocity and the steady-state test for the time series of the vertical wind velocity in combination with the horizontal wind component, the temperature, and carbon dioxide. Significantly higher fluxes of sensible heat, latent heat, and shear stress occurred during these periods. During LLJs and ACDFs, fluxes of sensible heat, latent heat, and CO 2 were mostly one-directional. For example, exclusively negative sensible heat fluxes occurred while intermittent turbulence was present. Latent heat fluxes were mostly positive during LLJs and ACDFs, with a median value of 34 W m − 2, while outside these periods the median was 2 W m − 2. In conclusion, intermittent turbulence periods exhibit a strong impact on nocturnal energy and mass fluxes...|$|E

Aims: Our primary objectives were to (1) assess whether landscape potential for CAP as a predictor improved species distribution models (SDMs) projections and (2) quantify the impact of CAP on the microclimate experienced by alpine plants compared to the macroclimate. Methods: We selected the Maritime Alps as our study area, located on the French–Italian border, and its rare endemic plant, Saxifraga florulenta, as model taxon. We generated a spatial layer in GIS (Geographic Information System) that reflected the potential of the landscape for CAP and ran five SDM algorithms with and without CAP layer as a predictor. Second, we recorded the microclimate plants experience with temperature loggers. Results: CAP as a predictor decreased the omission error of SDMs, mostly at low and mid elevations, where topography may buffer extreme temperatures, resulting in a more stable microclimate compared to macroclimate. Conclusions: We have shown that plants in an alpine landscape may be less exposed to climate warming than predicted by macroclimate. Topo-climatic GIS layers for SDM projections in mountain environments should integrate such physical mechanisms as CAP...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFor the {{radiation}} frost in agricultural fields, {{it is difficult}} to determine a satisfactory solution. To solve this problem, Selective Inverted Sink (SIS) is proposed as a new active frost protection method. However, the interactions of the SIS (also known as tower less wind machine) with some topo climatic effects such as cold air drainage and inversion strength are not well known. Consequently, this study was dedicated to two main objectives: First, different micro- topographic conditions are compared to validate the capability of SIS against {{the radiation}} frost. Second, a new hybrid system was proposed to improve the SIS effects. For these two purposes, three meteorological field campaigns were conducted on the fields of a vineyard and an orchard in Quebec, Canada. The air temperature was recorded with a fine spatiotemporal resolution min and spatial resolution in a synchronous mode of operation. In addition, the air temperature and humidity were recorded with mobile measurements and launching balloons to infer the general variations of temperature and specific humidity. Based on the topographic maps and field measurement, the several locations for SIS installation were determined. The high-resolution isotherms maps were used to evaluate the influence of SIS on nocturnal air-cooling. These results did not provide conclusive observational evidence that the SIS has impartial efficiency on nocturnal cooling. Indeed, a minor part of the SIS's exhausted flux was from horizontal direction, essentially due to land surface roughness. In contrast, a major part of the flux was from the upper layer around the SIS, which behaves like a funnel. The wind speed in the funnel's direction was 3 times greater than the wind speed in the horizontal direction. Therefore, the SIS was not able to remove a sufficient amount of <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>pool</b> or stagnant air. To elucidate the second objective, a simple and affordable innovation with reliable testing was performed. A hot water SIS hybrid system (HWSH) was proposed to use the “forced convection” produced by the SIS to disperse a maximum of water vapors into the air in order to decrease the air dryness. In this system, hot water with a temperature of 60 ° C was deployed under the SIS. The observation during a radiation frost night demonstrated that, although the reference area (35 m away from the HWSH) was affected by frost, hybrid system's location area was not affected. However, there was no significant temperature gradient between two points, but the moist enthalpy calculated at 18 m altitude was higher above the HWSH in comparison to reference point. In conclusion, the main physical notion throughout this study is moist enthalpy, which depicts heat content. Nocturnal cooling rate decreased by increasing the moist enthalpy using HWSH system. This environmentally clean hybrid system has potential to be considered as an alternative to some frost protection methods such as heaters and fires burning. In addition, the importance of fine-scale measurement in agricultural field is highlighted in this study...|$|E
40|$|Two high {{resolution}} numerical 1 D models, namely COBEL and PAFOG, have been adapted to compute a probabilistic fog forecast. Major modiﬁcations {{were made to}} the COBEL model. It was coupled to the NOAH land surface model {{to take into account the}} eﬀects of soil and vegetation and furthermore a parameterization of precipitation was added. To deal with the large uncertainty inherent to fog forecasts, a whole ensemble of 1 D runs is computed using the two diﬀerent numerical models and a set of diﬀerent initial conditions in combination with distinct boundary conditions. Initial conditions are obtained from variational data assimilation, which optimally combines observations with a ﬁrst guess taken from operational 3 D models. The design of the ensemble scheme computes members that should fairly well represent the uncertainty of the current meteorological regime. Veriﬁcation reveals that the probabilistic forecast can signiﬁcantly improve the current methods used at Z¨rich u Unique airport. The complex topography in Switzerland further complicates fog forecasting. In order to simulate processes like advection, <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> drainage ﬂows and <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>pooling,</b> the NMM 3 D model of NOAA/NCEP is modiﬁed and extended with detailed fog microphysics. The resulting 3 D fog model runs at a horizontal resolution ofkm and a vertical resolution comparable to the 1 D models. First results look very promising and are able to reproduce the spatial distribution of fog as it is seen by satellite. With increasing horizontal resolution of numerical weather prediction models, topographical eﬀects on radiation gain importance. With a newly developed parameterization it is possible to consider slope angle, aspect angle, shadows and restricted sky view on the subgrid scale and with negligible computational costs.

This study tests {{the effectiveness of}} using mesoscale models to forecast operationally those atmospheric conditions that cause anomalous propagation of radio waves. Providing early warning about where and when such conditions will develop would be particularly useful for military communications. To test mesoscale models' ability to provide such early warning, the Pennsylvania State University I National Center for Atmospheric Research Fifth Generation Mesoscale Model (MM 5) simulates atmospheric conditions around the mountainous, desert terrain near Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada for five forecast periods {{during the summer and}} fall of 2002. The extent of ducting regions predicted by the model and the mechanisms that result in the development of those regions are examined. The sensitivity of model predictions to changes in horizontal and vertical resolution is also tested. Results of these analyses reveal that rapid radiational cooling around sunset and subsequent <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>pooling</b> establish vertical temperature gradients that, along with pre-existing moisture gradients, are compacted by gravity waves along the lee sides of mountains within the model domain. This gradient compaction drives changes in the electromagnetic refractivity of the atmosphere that can trap radio waves near the Earth's surface. The sensitivity tests show that increasing the model's horizontal resolution increases the area of predicted ducting significantly. Increasing the vertical resolution does not increase the area of predicted ducting by much, but does sharpen the edges of larger predicted ducting regionsOceanographer of the Navy via Naval Sea Systems Command (Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, PM- 155) N 00039 - 97 -D- 004...|$|R
40|$|Among the {{potential}} reasons for enhanced warming rates in many high elevation regions is the nonlinear relationship between surface downward longwave radiation (DLR) and specific humidity (q). In {{this study we}} use ground-based observations at two neighboring high elevation sites in Southwestern Colorado that have different local topography and are 1. 3 kilometers apart horizontally and 348 meters vertically. We examine the spatial consistency of the sensitivities (partial derivatives) of DLR with respect to changes in q, and the sensitivities are obtained from the Jacobian matrix of a neural network analysis. Although the relationship between DLR and q is the same at both sites, the sensitivities are higher when q is smaller, which occurs more frequently at the higher elevation site. There is a distinct hourly distribution in the sensitivities at both sites especially for high sensitivity cases, although the range is greater at the lower elevation site. The hourly distribution of the sensitivities relates to that of q. Under clear skies during daytime, q is similar between the two sites, however under cloudy skies or at night, it is not. This means that the DLR-q sensitivities are similar at the two sites during daytime but not at night, and care must be exercised when using data from one site to infer the impact of water vapor feedbacks at another site, particularly at night. Our analysis suggests that care should be exercised when using the lapse rate adjustment to infill high frequency data in a complex topographical region, particularly {{when one of the}} stations is subject to <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>pooling</b> as found here...|$|R
40|$|Even slight terrain inhomogeneities {{can cause}} large {{horizontal}} {{variations in the}} clear, stably stratified, nocturnal boundary layer largely through <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> drainage. By early morning the valleys and depressions can be several degrees cooler than the adjacent slopes and plateaus. As surface heating begins in the morning, these horizontal variations can lead to abrupt changes in temperature and wind speed at valley observation sites, as the boundary layer warms and becomes unstably stratified. Temperature and wind speed changes of 12 K and 6 m s⁻¹ respectively, within a 30 min period are observed even in valleys as shallow as 50 m with slopes of only 0. 007. These changes are too large to {{be accounted for by}} vertical convergence of turbulent beat flux. Rather, it appears that a well-mixed boundary layer is advected into the valley from the upstream slopes or plateaus. Data from the National Hail Research Experiment (NHRE) 1976 surface mesonet are used to show that, statistically, this abrupt change is a frequent occurrence, throughout the summer, even in broad shallow valleys, but almost never occurs on plateau observation sites. A case study from the Haswell, Colorado, experiment of 1975 shows in detail, through a variety of observations, the sequence of events that occurs during this rapid morning transition. As surface heating begins, the valley air, which is about 4 K <b>colder</b> than the <b>air</b> over the upstream slope and plateau, becomes less stably stratified and increasingly turbulent. Eventually, the shear stress {{at the top of the}} boundary layer becomes large enough to pull the <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> out of the valley. The valley air is then replaced by warmer upstream air that is already well mixed. The criteria necessary for this transition to occur are evaluated and generalized for application to other situations. These criteria are then applied to several previous observational studies of the dissipation of <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>pools</b> formed in valleys through nighttime radiational cooling. The observed transition in temperature typically precedes the velocity transition by 20 – 40 min. This lag appears to be due to both the adverse pressure gradient developed during the temperature transition, and the difference in the shear and temperature gradient production terms in the equations for shear stress and heat flux...|$|R
