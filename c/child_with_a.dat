40|$|We {{compared}} the occurrence {{and timing of}} divorce in 391 parents of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and a matched representative sample of parents of children without disabilities using a survival analysis. Parents of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ASD had {{a higher rate of}} divorce than the comparison group (23. 5 % vs. 13. 8 %). The rate of divorce remained high throughout the son’s or daughter’s childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood for parents of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ASD, whereas it decreased following the son’s or daughter’s childhood (after about age 8 years) in the comparison group. Younger maternal age when the <b>child</b> <b>with</b> ASD was born and having the child born later in the birth order were positively predictive of divorce for parents of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ASD.

40|$|<b>Children</b> <b>with</b> Reading and Writing Difficulties and Their Language and Cognitive Abilities <b>A</b> Comparison <b>with</b> <b>Children</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Cochlear Implant Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{cognitive}} abilities that are important for reading in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> reading disabilities, <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cochlear implantation and typically developed children. 64 children aged 10 - 12 years participated in the study. To answer the question at issue we used the following tests: Block Design from WISC III, PPVT III, TOWRE, SL 40 and a few chosen tests out of the SIPS battery. On tests of the lexical access <b>children</b> <b>with</b> reading disabilities performed at the same level as hearing children, while the <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cochlear implant performed significantly lower. Test of the phonological and complex working memory showed that <b>children</b> <b>with</b> reading disabilities performed significantly higher than <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cochlear implant, but at the same time lower than typically developed children on the test of phonological working memory. Tests of reading ability showed that <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cochlear implant performed at the same level as typically developed <b>children,</b> while <b>children</b> <b>with</b> reading disabilities showed lower results. The results indicate that the <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cochlear implant can develop an adequate reading ability in spite of their phonological difficulties. Phonological skills do not seem to be the only factor influencing reading ability of the examined groups. ...|$|R
5|$|Rumours that Prince Albert Victor {{may have}} committed, or been {{responsible}} for, the Jack the Ripper murders were first mentioned in print in 1962. It was later alleged, among others by Stephen Knight in , that Albert Victor fathered a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{woman in the}} Whitechapel district of London, and either he or several high-ranking men committed the murders {{in an effort to}} cover up his indiscretion. Though such claims have been repeated frequently, scholars have dismissed them as fantasies, and refer to indisputable proof of the Prince's innocence. For example, on 30 September 1888, when Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes were murdered in London, Albert Victor was over 500miles (over 800km) away at Balmoral, the royal retreat in Scotland, in the presence of Queen Victoria, other family members, visiting German royalty and a large number of staff. According to the official Court Circular, family journals and letters, newspaper reports and other sources, he could not have been near any of the murders. Other fanciful conspiracy theories are that he died of syphilis or poison, that he was pushed off a cliff on the instructions of Lord Randolph Churchill or that his death was faked to remove him from the line of succession.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} meaning of {{wellbeing}} for <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> disability in New Zealand, an area of social policy that has been largely unexamined. Focusing on the school environment, three questions are addressed: What does wellbeing mean for <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> disability? What factors influence it? Are current policy frameworks which address child wellbeing relevant to the wellbeing of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> disability? The research involved qualitative data collection from nine purposively selected participants: <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> disability, their parents and key informants involved in service provision and policy development. A critical review of international and national literature on definitions of wellbeing and disability, and on existing data sources, {{is followed by a}} socio-demographic profile of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> disability in New Zealand. Qualitative findings are interpreted in relation to current New Zealand social policy initiatives and frameworks - New Zealand's Agenda for Children, the Whole Child Approach and the Key Settings Model - as well as the theoretical perspectives of social solidarity, wellbeing, the ecological theory of human development and discourses of disability. Findings indicate that the concept of wellbeing as applied to all New Zealand children is also relevant to <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> disability. The difference however, lies in the factors which ultimately influence whether the various dimensions of wellbeing will actually be experienced by <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> disability. For these children, communication as a dimension of wellbeing for example, is influenced by language skill acquisition, which in turn depends upon allocation of appropriate and adequate resourcing of the child's learning environment. The conclusion drawn is that policy frameworks, principles and social indicators addressing child wellbeing, are inconsistently applied <b>with</b> regard to <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> disability. New Zealand's Agenda for Children which promotes an ecological approach to child wellbeing would benefit from further adaptation to reflect the needs of this specific child population. The notion of wellbeing for <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> disability needs further development for the purpose of knowledge building, and to ensure clearer articulation between processes of policy development, service provision, and resource allocation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to compare risk factors for {{coronary}} atherosclerosis in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> family history of unheralded myocardial infarction or uncomplicated stable angina. Background. In patients with unheralded myocardial infarction, coronary atherosclerosis might have a greater tendency to cause acute coronary occlusion than in patients with uncomplicated stable angina, suggesting the possibility of different risk factors in these two groups of patients. Methods. Serum lipid levels were compared in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> family history of unheralded myocardial infarction (236 children) or uncomplicated stable angina (48 children) or no family history of ischemic heart disease (613 children). Results. Mean (± 1 SD) total serum cholesterol was higher in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> family history of myocardial infarction than in control subjects (161 ± 28 vs. 154 ± 25 mg%, p < 0. 01). In <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> family history of stable angina, mean total serum cholesterol (159 ± 25 mg%) was similar to that in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> family history of myocardial infarction. High density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I were higher in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> family history of stable angina than in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> family history of myocardial infarction and control subjects (69 ± 18 vs. 61 ± 13 and 60 ± 13 mg%, p < 0. 01; 143 ± 23 vs. 130 ± 18 and 129 ± 18 mg%, p < 0. 01, respectively). in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> family history of myocardial infarction, the low density/high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio was significantly higher than in control subjects (1. 53 ± 0. 64 vs. 1. 44 ± 0. 56, p < 0. 05). Conversely, in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> family history of stable angina, this ratio (1. 24 ± 0. 51) was significantly lower (p < 0. 05) than in control subjects. Conclusions. Risk factors for coronary athersclerosis in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> family history of unheralded myocardial infraction are different from those in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> family history of uncomplicated stable angina. Higher levels of apolipoprotein A-I early in life might reduce the risk of acute coronary syndromes...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Of {{major concern}} in any febrile <b>child</b> {{presenting}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> seizure {{is the possibility}} of bacterial meningitis (BM). We did a systematic review to estimate the risk of BM among various subgroups of young <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> first seizure in the context of fever, and to assess the utility of routine lumbar puncture (LP) in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> apparent first FS. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: MEDLINE, INIST, and the COCHRANE Library databases were searched from inception to December 2011 for published studies, supplemented by manual searches of bibliographies of potentially relevant articles and review articles. Studies reporting the prevalence of BM in young children presenting to emergency care <b>with</b> <b>a</b> first: i) "seizure and fever", ii) apparent simple FS, and iii) apparent complex FS were included. Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria. In <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> first "seizure and fever", the pooled prevalence of BM was 2. 6 % (95 % CI 0. 9 - 5. 1); the diagnosis of BM might be suspected from clinical examination in 95 % of children > 6 months. In <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> apparent simple FS, the average prevalence of BM was 0. 2 % (range 0 to 1 %). The pooled prevalence of BM among <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> apparent complex FS was 0. 6 % (95 % CI 0. 2 - 1. 4). The utility of routine LP for diagnosis of CNS infections requiring immediate treatment in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> apparent first FS was low: the number of patients needed to test to identify one case of such infections was 1109 in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> apparent first simple FS, and 180 in those <b>with</b> <b>an</b> apparent first complex FS.
