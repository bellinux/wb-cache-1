40|$|We {{construct}} an agent-based New Keynesian DSGE model with different social network structures {{to investigate the}} significance of network topologies to macroeconomic stability. According to our simulation results, {{we find that the}} more liquid the information flow, the higher the stability of the economy. Furthermore, the speed of information dissemination and the degree of clustering among agents may give rise to an adverse effect on economic stability. Finally, we find that the scale-free network will lead to the most dramatic economic fluctuations. The result is ascribed to the scale-free network's high centrality. It indicates that the opinion leaders may bring about a <b>conglomerate</b> <b>effect</b> that will cause fluctuations in the economy...|$|E
30|$|In this paper, it {{has been}} shown that non-stationary {{received}} signals at ultra-wideband impulse radars can be addressed by Fourier series model with time-varying coefficients. Next, simply by computing statistical features of the coefficients, we show that this model can be considered as a sum of band-limited sources. Based on the unconditional orthonormal representation of band-limited signals, a MMSE estimator is introduced to determine the Fourier coefficients. Getting the most out of our novel estimator, we suggest a new method for blind and robust detection that enables us to determine the range and velocity of moving targets, accurately without utilizing any matched filters. In this new approach, no prior information is required for detection, except pulse repetition interval. Since the novel method is based on the non-stationary analysis, the signal is analyzed in a long period of time to estimate the velocity in high resolution. Furthermore, since there is no assumption on the noise distribution, the signal of interest can be simply detected in the presence of correlated and non-Gaussian noise, i.e., encompassing the <b>conglomerate</b> <b>effects</b> of clutter and interference. To verify our result, an experimental test and simulations are also presented comparing the new detector with conventional ultra-wideband impulse radar detectors referred to as interleaved periodic correlation processing (IPCP) in the literature.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to apply a {{statistical}} analysis of compositional data in order to study the inactivity rate in the economy of Argentina. We try to confirm the hypothesis of allometric effects on overall levels of economic inactivity per big urban conglomerate and their features according to the different causes of inactivity. In other words, whether the percentage of inactives due to various reasons of inactivity {{is related to the}} inactivity rate per urban <b>conglomerate.</b> Allometric <b>effects</b> have been found in regional studies of inactivity in the United Kingdom. According to these, some causes of inactivity, such as incapacity, are strongly related to the overall levels of inactivity per region. However, results from May 2003 allow us to reject the hypothesis that inactivity components per urban conglomerate are directly related to inactivity rates...|$|R
40|$|Enantiomers are chiral {{molecules}} (i. e. {{they are}} mirror-images of each other). They have identical physical properties {{except for the}} rotation of polarized light. However their chemical properties are different when reacting with other chiral molecules. The majority of biological processes involve the reaction {{of two or more}} chiral molecules. There is therefore a strong interest coming from the pharmaceutical, food and agricultural industry for the separation of enantiomers. Separation methods such as chromatography exist but are generally expensive and limited in scale. Stereosynthesis often has prohibitive development and operating costs. For 10 to 15 % of known enantiomeric systems, a conglomerate is formed upon crystallization (each individual crystal contains only one type of enantiomer). Crystallization is widely used as an inexpensive separation process which takes advantage of the difference in solubility of the compounds to be separated and yields very high purities in one separation stage. There is no difference in solubility between two enantiomers but in the special case of conglomerates, a difference in crystallization rate can be used as the driving force for the separation of the enantiomers. In this project, the effects of the important parameters governing the crystallization of asparagine (ASN) were studied in order to develop a separation method based on crystallization. ASN is an amino acid having two enantiomers (L-ASN and D-ASN) and forming a <b>conglomerate.</b> The <b>effects</b> of mixing speed, crystallization temperature, initial supersaturation and seeds (amount, type and time of addition) on the crystallization rates were studied. The crystallization temperature was shown to have a negligible effect over the range studied. Increasing initial supersaturations had a strong accelerating effect on the crystallization. The addition of L-ASN seeds increased the crystallization rate of L-ASN without affecting that of D-ASN. The corresponding statement was true for D-ASN. Larger amounts of seeds and faster mixing increased crystallization rates. Separation methods were developed and 95. 8 - 97. 7 % pure enantiomers with yields of 73. 1 % were obtained in a cyclic process. The growth and desupersaturation rates were also modeled...|$|R
40|$|Title: Multi channel publishing: a {{qualitative}} study on how Norrköpings Tidningen publishes news in multiple channels Author: Roland Albinsson Thesis supervisor: Per-Anders Forstorp Background: In {{this day and}} age, the media is omnipresent {{and a part of}} our daily life. The phenomenon of media convergence {{can be traced back to}} the birth of the internet, and today all of the major newspapers have a website of their own. As a result of multichannel publishing, consumers have a wide range of tv channels to choose from, but there is still uncertainty as to whether more channels automatically equates to more and better news. There is no doubt about the fact that multi channel publishing is a necessary survival skill for media <b>conglomerates</b> today, but <b>effects</b> such as news recycling and the concentration of ownership are in conflict with the consumers’ availability demands. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to, by means of a case study, describe how NT’s multi channel publishing is an expression of media convergence, as well as to study how the news are affected by multi channel publishing. Research procedure: This study is based on three different research methods, observations, text analyses and qualitative interviews. Interviews were conducted with three employees at NT, which was supplemented by an observational study of the work carried out by the NT employees. Moreover, a text analysis of three news articles that were published in multiple channels at NT was carried out. Results: The case study shows that NT is more converged in theory than in practice, and that NT is currently in a development stage of convergence. The results also clarify that NT has an open work environment and advocates that employees work in different publishing channels. It is also possible to find traces of cross promotion at NT. The study indicates that the desire to publish the news in multiple channels gives rise to news recycling and as well as news homogenization, which may impair the quality of the news...|$|R
