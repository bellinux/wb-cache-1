The design utilizes a specialized belt hanger/holsters that grasps the retracted blade so the blade is pulled fully open when unholstering. It is a unique compact fixed blade alternative.

40|$|In {{the present}} investigations, effect of {{streamwise}} end wall fences {{on the performance}} improvement of a turbine is studied. The fences with heights of 12 mm, 16 mm were attached normal to the end wall and at a half pitch away from the blades. A miniaturized pressure probe was traversed at the exit of the cascade from midspan to the end wall at 26 locations covering more points in the end wall region. For each spanwise location, the probe was traversed in the pitchwise direction for more than 25 points <b>covering</b> one <b>blade</b> pitch. The boundary layer fence near the end wall remains effective in changing the path of pressure side of leg of horseshoe and weaken the cross flow. The overturn in flow has reduced near the end wall when fences are incorporated while outside end wall and in loss core region, it&# 13; underturns slightly as result of reduction in secondary loss. The total loss is reduced by 15 %, 25 % for fences of height 12 mm, and 16 mm respectively. The corresponding change was obtained in the drag and lift coefficients...|$|R

40|$|Three-dimensional {{flow field}} {{measurements}} are presented {{for a large}} scale transonic turbine blade cascade. Flow field total pressures and pitch and yaw flow angles were measured at an inlet Reynolds number of 1. 0 x 10 (exp 6) and at an isentropic exit Mach number of 1. 3 in a low turbulence environment. Flow field data was obtained on five pitchwise/spanwise measurement planes, two upstream and three downstream of the cascade, each <b>covering</b> three <b>blade</b> pitches. Three-hole boundary layer probes and five-hole pitch/yaw probes were used to obtain data at over 1200 locations {{in each of the}} measurement planes. Blade and endwall static pressures were also measured at an inlet Reynolds number of 0. 5 x 10 (exp 6) and at an isentropic exit Mach number of 1. 0. Tests were conducted in a linear cascade at the NASA Lewis Transonic Turbine Blade Cascade Facility. The test article was a turbine rotor with 136 deg of turning and an axial chord of 12. 7 cm. The flow field in the cascade is highly three-dimensional as a result of thick boundary layers at the test section inlet and because of the high degree of flow turning. The large scale allowed for very detailed measurements of both flow field and surface phenomena. The intent of the work is to provide benchmark quality data for CFD code and model verification...|$|R
40|$|Polyhedral {{forms are}} {{extremely}} widespread both in animate and inanimate nature. Thus, crystals occur as polyhedra only.

The specific morphology of the Boxfish reveals in polygonal osseous <b>blades,</b> <b>covering</b> its body. As for the Porcupinefish, its polyhedral approximation was observed via certain geometrical techniques applied. Namely, their spine bases were considered the Delaunay point (R, r) -systems. Consequently, the respective Dirichlet tiling proved to be quasifullerenes and analogous to the Boxfish morphology. This unexpected geometrical dualism of the two families corroborates their taxonomic affinity within the Tetradontiformes order.

50|$|Japanese sword makers {{developed}} the secret technique of differential hardening by <b>covering</b> their sword <b>blades</b> in different thicknesses of clay. The thinner clay allowed the heated metal to cool faster when quenched. Also, the thinner metal {{of the edge}} cooled faster than the spine. The faster cooled metal had a finer crystal structure which along with being harder also allowed polishing the blade to reveal the pattern between the fast and slow cooled steel. As well, {{the different types of}} steel had different densities which led to the blade, straight or almost straight blade before quenching, to becoming curved. For this reason it was necessary when quenching to plunge the blade straight into the quenching fluid as a blade that went in at a different angle could curve to the side and be rendered utterly useless. European sword makers produced similar results using differential tempering.|$|R
40|$|Aerodynamic {{measurements}} {{showing the}} effects of large incidence angle variations on an HPT turbine blade set are presented. Measurements were made in NASA's Transonic Turbine Blade Cascade Facility which {{has been used in}} previous studies to acquire detailed aerodynamic and heat transfer measurements for CFD code validation. The current study supports the development of variable-speed power turbine (VSPT) speed-change technology for the NASA Large Civil Tilt Rotor (LCTR) vehicle. In order to maintain acceptable main rotor propulsive efficiency, the VSPT operates over a nearly 50 % speed range from takeoff to altitude cruise. This results in 50 degrees or more variations in VSPT blade incidence angles. The cascade facility has the ability to operate over a wide range of Reynolds numbers and Mach numbers, but had to be modified in order to accommodate the negative incidence angle variation required by the LCTR VSPT operation. Using existing blade geometry with previously acquired aerodynamic data, the tunnel was re-baselined and the new incidence angle range was exercised. Midspan exit total pressure and flow angle measurements were obtained at seven inlet flow angles. For each inlet angle, data were obtained at five flow conditions with inlet Reynolds numbers varying from 6. 83 10 (exp 5) to 0. 85 10 (exp 5) and two isentropic exit Mach numbers of 0. 74 and 0. 34. The midspan flowfield measurements were acquired using a three-hole pneumatic probe located in a survey plane 8. 6 % axial chord downstream of the blade trailing edge plane and <b>covering</b> three <b>blade</b> passages.

This work supports the development of variable-speed power turbine (VSPT) speed-change technology for the NASA Large Civil Tilt Rotor (LCTR) vehicle. In order to maintain acceptable main rotor propulsive efficiency, the VSPT operates over a nearly 50 % speed range from takeoff to altitude cruise.

The Transonic Turbine Blade Cascade Facility {{has the ability to}} operate over a wide range of Reynolds numbers and Mach numbers, but had to be modified in order to accommodate the negative incidence angle variation required by the LCTR VSPT operation. Details of the modifications are described. An incidence-tolerant blade was developed under an RTPAS study contract and tested in the cascade to look at the effects of large incidence angle and Reynolds number variations. Recent test results are presented which include midspan exit total pressure and flow angle measurements obtained at three inlet angles representing the cruise, take-off, and maximum incidence flight mission points. For each inlet angle, data were obtained at five flow conditions with exit Reynolds numbers varying from 2. 12 106 to 2. 12 105 and two isentropic exit Mach numbers of 0. 72 and 0. 35. Three-dimensional flowfield measurements were also acquired at the cruise and take-off points. The flowfield measurements were acquired using a five-hole and three-hole pneumatic probe located in a survey plane 8. 6 % axial chord downstream of the blade trailing edge plane and <b>covering</b> three <b>blade</b> passages.

40|$|The {{effects of}} inlet {{turbulence}} intensity on the aerodynamic {{performance of a}} variable speed power turbine blade are examined over large incidence and Reynolds number ranges. Both high and low turbulence studies were conducted in the NASA Glenn Research Center Transonic Turbine Blade Cascade Facility. The purpose of the low inlet turbulence {{study was to examine}} the transitional flow effects that are anticipated at cruise Reynolds numbers. The high turbulence study extends this to LPT-relevant turbulence levels while perhaps sacrificing transitional flow effects. Downstream total pressure and exit angle data were acquired for ten incidence angles ranging from + 15. 8 to 51. 0. For each incidence angle, data were obtained at five flow conditions with the exit Reynolds number ranging from 2. 12105 to 2. 12106 and at a design exit Mach number of 0. 72. In order to achieve the lowest Reynolds number, the exit Mach number was reduced to 0. 35 due to facility constraints. The inlet turbulence intensity, Tu, was measured using a single-wire hotwire located 0. 415 axial-chord upstream of the blade row. The inlet turbulence levels ranged from 0. 25 - 0. 4 for the low Tu tests and 8 - 15 for the high Tu study. Tu measurements were also made farther upstream so that turbulence decay rates could be calculated as needed for computational inlet boundary conditions. Downstream flow field measurements were obtained using a pneumatic five-hole pitchyaw probe located in a survey plane 7 axial chord aft of the blade trailing edge and <b>covering</b> three <b>blade</b> passages. Blade and endwall static pressures were acquired for each flow condition as well. The blade loading data show that the suction surface separation that was evident at many of the low Tu conditions has been eliminated. At the extreme positive and negative incidence angles, the data show substantial differences in the exit flow field. These differences are attributable to both the higher inlet Tu directly and to the thinner inlet endwall boundary layer that the turbulence grid imposes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA turbine design method {{based on}} {{pressure}} controlled vortex design (PCVD) {{is presented to}} design a small-size turbine stage. Contrary to the conventional controlled vortex design (CVD) method, the main objective of PCVD is to control the axial velocity and radial pressure in the stator–rotor gap. Through controlling axial velocity, the PCVD establishes a direct tie to meridional stream surface. Thus stream surface variation is induced, resulting in a large secondary flow vortex <b>covering</b> the full <b>blade</b> passage in the respective stator and rotor. This secondary flow vortex could be dedicated to control the secondary flow mitigation and migration. Through radial pressure, the PCVD is also associated with the macroscopic driving force of fluid motion. So the better benefit of CVD can be achieved. The core concept behind PCVD is to mainly control the spanwise pressure gradient by altering profile loading at various spanwise locations. Therefore not only the local profile lift is affected, but also the resulting throat widths, stage reaction degree, and massflow rate are altered or redistributed respectively. With the PCVD method, the global stage efficiency is increased successfully while the mass flow rate keeps constant. Additionally there is no endwall shape optimization, stacking optimization, or pitch/chord variations, concentrating solely on varying blade profile deflections and stagger...|$|R

The current study extends this to LPT-relevant turbulence levels while perhaps sacrificing transitional flow effects. Assessing the effects of turbulence at these large incidence and Reynolds number variations complements the existing database. Downstream total pressure and exit angle data were acquired for 10 incidence angles ranging from + 15. 8 deg to 51. 0 deg. For each incidence angle, data were obtained at five flow conditions with the exit Reynolds number ranging from 2. 1210 (exp 5) to 2. 1210 (exp 6) and at a design exit Mach number of 0. 72. In order to achieve the lowest Reynolds number, the exit Mach number was reduced to 0. 35 due to facility constraints. The inlet turbulence intensity, Tu, was measured using a single-wire hotwire located 0. 415 axial-chord upstream of the blade row. The inlet turbulence levels ranged from 8 to 15 percent for the current study. Tu measurements were also made farther upstream so that turbulence decay rates could be calculated as needed for computational inlet boundary conditions.

40|$|AbstractThis article {{deals with}} {{application}} of grooved type casing treatment for suppression of spike stall {{in an isolated}} axial compressor rotor blade row. The continuous grooved casing treatment covering the whole compressor circumference is of 1. 8 mm in depth and located between 90 % and 108 % chord of the blade tip as measured from leading edge. The method of investigation is based on time-accurate three-dimensional full annulus numerical simulations for cases with and without casing treatment. Discretization of the Navier–Stokes equations {{has been carried out}} based on an upwind second-order scheme and k-ω-SST (Shear Stress Transport) turbulence modeling has been used for estimation of eddy viscosity. Time-dependent flow structure results for the smooth casing reveal that there are two criteria for spike stall inception known as leading edge spillage and trailing edge backflow, which occur at specific mass flow rates in near-stall conditions. In this case, two dominant stall cells of different sizes could be observed. The larger one is caused by the spike stall <b>covering</b> roughly two <b>blade</b> passages in the circumferential direction and about 25 % span in the radial direction. Spike stall disturbances are accompanied by lower frequencies and higher amplitudes of the pressure signals. Casing treatment causes flow blockages to reduce due to alleviation of backflow regions, which in turn reduces the total pressure loss and increases the axial velocity in the blade tip gap region, as well as tip leakage flow fluctuation at higher frequencies and lower amplitudes. Eventually, it can be concluded that the casing treatment of the stepped tip gap type could increase the stall margin of the compressor. This fact is basically due to retarding the movement of the interface region between incoming and tip leakage flows towards the rotor leading edge plane and suppressing the reversed flow around the blade trailing edge...|$|R
