2500|$|Ballast water {{taken up}} at sea and {{released}} in port {{is a major}} source of unwanted exotic marine life. The invasive freshwater zebra mussels, native to the Black, Caspian, and Azov seas, were probably transported to the Great Lakes via ballast water from a transoceanic vessel. Meinesz believes that one of the worst cases of a single invasive species causing harm to an ecosystem can be attributed to a seemingly harmless jellyfish. Mnemiopsis leidyi, a species of <b>comb</b> <b>jellyfish</b> that spread so it now inhabits estuaries {{in many parts of the}} world. It was first introduced in 1982, and thought to have been transported to the Black Sea in a ship's ballast water. The population of the jellyfish grew exponentially and, by 1988, it was wreaking havoc upon the local fishing industry. [...] "The anchovy catch fell from 204,000 tons in 1984 to 200 tons in 1993; sprat from 24,600 tons in 1984 to 12,000 tons in 1993; horse mackerel from 4,000 tons in 1984 to zero in 1993." [...] Now that the jellyfish have exhausted the zooplankton, including fish larvae, their numbers have fallen dramatically, yet they continue to maintain a stranglehold on the ecosystem.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{problems}} with ballast water transfer is the transport of harmful organisms. Meinesz believes that one of the worst cases of a single invasive species causing harm to an ecosystem can be attributed to a seemingly harmless jellyfish. Mnemiopsis leidyi, a species of <b>comb</b> <b>jellyfish</b> that inhabits estuaries from the United States to the Valdés peninsula in Argentina along the Atlantic coast, has caused notable damage in the Black Sea. It was first introduced in 1982, and thought to have been transported to the Black Sea in a ship’s ballast water. The population of the jellyfish shot up exponentially and, by 1988, it was wreaking havoc upon the local fishing industry. [...] "The anchovy catch fell from 204000 t in 1984 to 200 t in 1993; sprat from 24600 t in 1984 to 12000 t in 1993; horse mackerel from 4000 t in 1984 to zero in 1993." [...] Now that the jellyfish have exhausted the zooplankton, including fish larvae, their numbers have fallen dramatically, yet they continue to maintain a stranglehold on the ecosystem. Recently the jellyfish have been discovered in the Caspian Sea. Invasive species can take over once occupied areas, facilitate the spread of new diseases, introduce new genetic material, alter landscapes and jeopardize the ability of native species to obtain food. [...] "On land and in the sea, invasive species are responsible for about 137 billion dollars in lost revenue and management costs in the U.S. each year." ...|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} correlation was observed between satellite derived chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations and {{the biomass of}} the invasive <b>comb</b> <b>jellyfish</b> Mnemiopsis leidyi in the southern Caspian Sea. By consuming the herbivorous zooplankton, the predatory ctenophore M. leidyi may have caused levels of Chl a to rise to very high values (~ 9 mg m- 3) in the southern Caspian Sea. There might also be several other factors concurrent with predation effects of M. leidyi influencing Chl a levels in this region, such as eutrophication and climatic changes which play major roles in nutrient, phytoplankton and zooplankton variations. The decrease in pelagic fishes due to overfishing, natural and anthropogenic impacts might have provided a suitable environment for M. leidyi to spread throughout this enclosed basin. JRC.

50|$|Prawns are an {{attractive}} food for predators, {{with a higher}} energy content than most other invertebrates. The larvae are prey to <b>comb</b> jellies, <b>jellyfish,</b> chaetognaths, fish and other crustaceans (such as mantis shrimp and crabs), and only a tiny proportion survive. Juveniles are targeted {{by a number of}} fish, cephalopods and birds; Litopenaeus vannamei juveniles experience 90% mortality in the 6-12 weeks they spend in Mexican lagoons, and this is thought to be due almost entirely to predation. Adult prawns are less susceptible to predation, but can fall prey to some fish.|$|R
30|$|Population {{growth of}} {{cities in the}} Caspian basin, {{increased}} discharge of different wastewaters (industrial, agricultural and civil effluents), oil extraction development and the connection of this sea with the open seas through Volga-den canal have caused many problems (Bagheri et al. 2010) like as increased water temperature, <b>comb</b> <b>jellyfish</b> invasion, and eutrophication {{at the end of}} twentieth century (Izaguirre et al. 2001). Phytoplankton is the main group that plays a dynamic and active role in the marine food web, in exploiting primary products at higher levels of nutrients and elements in the global cycle of crops. By itself, it contains 1 % of organic carbon and 45 % of annual primary production on Earth. Phytoplankton include proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, vitamins and mineral salts, that they are directly and indirectly considered as food sources for all marine organisms. In addition, the oxygen produced by the phytoplankton is a result of photosynthesis, a vital component of the system on the Earth (Falkowski and Raven 1997).|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe larval and polyp {{stages of}} extant Cnidaria are bi-layered with {{an absence of}} {{mesoderm}} and its differentiation products. This anatomy originally prompted the diploblast classification of the cnidarian phylum. The medusa stage, or jellyfish, however, has a more complex anatomy characterized by a swimming bell with a well-developed striated muscle layer. Based on developmental histology of the hydrozoan medusa this muscle derives from the entocodon, a mesoderm-like third cell layer established {{at the onset of}} medusa formation. According to recent molecular studies cnidarian homologs to bilaterian mesoderm and myogenic regulators are expressed in the larval and polyp stages {{as well as in the}} entocodon and derived striated muscle. Moreover striated and smooth muscle cells may have evolved directly and independently from non-muscle cells as indicated by phylogenetic analysis of myosin heavy chain genes (MHC class II). To accommodate all evidences we propose that striated muscle-based locomotion coevolved with the nervous and digestive systems in a basic metazoan Bauplan from which the ancestors of the Ctenophora (<b>comb</b> <b>jellyfish),</b> Cnidaria (jellyfish and polyps), as well as the Bilateria are derived. We argue for a motile tri-layered cnidarian ancestor and a monophyletic descent of striated muscle in Cnidaria and Bilateria. As a consequence, diploblasty evolved secondarily in cnidarian larvae and polyps...|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescence occurs widely among animals, {{especially}} in the open sea, including fish, <b>jellyfish,</b> <b>comb</b> jellies, crustaceans, and cephalopod molluscs; in some fungi and bacteria; and in various terrestrial invertebrates including insects. About 76% of the main taxa of deep-sea animals produce light. Most marine light-emission is in the blue and green light spectrum. However, some loose-jawed fish emit red and infrared light, and the genus Tomopteris emits yellow light.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Jellyfish,</b> <b>comb</b> jellies, {{and related}} animals have diffuse nerve nets {{rather than a}} central nervous system. [...] In most {{jellyfish}} the nerve net is spread more or less evenly across the body; in comb jellies it is concentrated near the mouth. [...] The nerve nets consist of sensory neurons that pick up chemical, tactile, and visual signals, motor neurons that can activate contractions of the body wall, and intermediate neurons that detect patterns of activity in the sensory neurons and send signals to groups of motor neurons as a result. [...] In some cases groups of intermediate neurons are clustered into discrete ganglia.|$|R
500|$|Some tissues such as muscles {{can be made}} transparent, {{provided}} {{either they}} are very thin or organised as regular layers or fibrils that are small compared to the wavelength of visible light. Familiar examples of transparent body parts are the lens and cornea of the vertebrate eye. The lens is made of the protein crystallin; the cornea is made of the protein collagen. Other structures cannot be made transparent, notably the retinas or equivalent light-absorbing structures of eyes — they must absorb light {{to be able to}} function. The camera-type eye of vertebrates and cephalopods must be completely opaque. Finally, some structures are visible for a reason, such as to lure prey. For example, the nematocysts (stinging cells) of the transparent siphonophore Agalma okenii resemble small copepods. Examples of transparent marine animals include a wide variety of larvae, including coelenterates, siphonophores, salps (floating tunicates), gastropod molluscs, polychaete worms, many shrimplike crustaceans, and fish; whereas the adults of most of these are opaque and pigmented, resembling the seabed or shores where they live. Adult <b>comb</b> jellies and <b>jellyfish</b> are mainly transparent, like their watery background. The small Amazon river fish Microphilypnus amazonicus and the shrimps it associates with, Pseudopalaemon gouldingi, are so transparent as to be [...] "almost invisible"; further, these species appear to select whether to be transparent or more conventionally mottled (disruptively patterned) according to the local background in the environment.|$|R
