50|$|A mobile {{broadband}} modem, {{also known as}} a <b>connect</b> <b>card</b> or data card, is a type of modem that allows a laptop, a personal computer or a router to receive Internet access via a {{mobile broadband}} connection instead of using telephone or cable television lines. A mobile Internet user can connect using a wireless modem to a wireless Internet Service Provider (ISP) to get Internet access.|$|R
5000|$|Having since {{acquired}} 3dfx, Nvidia in 2004 reintroduced the SLI acronym (now Scalable Link Interface) in the GeForce 6 Series. ATI Technologies {{has also}} since introduced its own multi-chip implementation, dubbed [...] "CrossFire". Although NVIDIA SLI and ATI Crossfire {{operate on the}} original SLI principle of utilizing the power of multiple video cards, the implementation is different, such as NVIDIA requiring graphics cards running the same graphics processor, and an SLI bridge to be <b>connected</b> to the <b>cards.</b> CrossFire, from the Rx 200 series onwards, uses the PCI Express bus instead of a bridge to <b>connect</b> <b>cards</b> together.|$|R
30|$|Hence, the {{embedded}} {{program is}} charged of RSSI collection and sending. The functions realized by the embedded system {{are the following}} ones: firstly, to establish a wireless network, then <b>connecting</b> <b>cards</b> on the same network; secondly, to assure a stable communication between them. In addition to making requests to collect RSSI from various anchors, it sends the RSSI vector collected and realizes commands reading via USB to manage card behavior.|$|R
25|$|Wire grid detector, also {{to detect}} {{micrometeorite}} impacts. It consisted of 12 parallel <b>connected</b> <b>cards</b> mounted in a fiberglass supporting ring. Each card was wound with {{two layers of}} enameled nickel alloy wire with a diameter of 17µm (21µm with the enamel insulation included) in such way that a total area of 1cm by 1cm was completely covered. If a micrometeorite of about 10µm impacted, it would fracture the wire, destroy the electrical connection, and thus record the event.|$|R
50|$|Modems {{which use}} a mobile {{telephone}} system (GPRS, UMTS, HSPA, EVDO, WiMax, etc.), {{are known as}} mobile broadband modems (sometimes also called wireless modems). Wireless modems can be embedded inside a laptop or appliance, or be external to it. External wireless modems are <b>connect</b> <b>cards,</b> USB modems for mobile broadband and cellular routers. A <b>connect</b> <b>card</b> is a PC Card or ExpressCard which slides into a PCMCIA/PC card/ExpressCard slot on a computer. USB wireless modems use a USB port on the laptop instead of a PC card or ExpressCard slot. A USB modem used for mobile broadband Internet is also {{sometimes referred to as}} a dongle. A cellular router may have an external datacard (AirCard) that slides into it. Most cellular routers do allow such datacards or USB modems. Cellular routers may not be modems by definition, but they contain modems or allow modems to be slid into them. The difference between a cellular router and a wireless modem is that a cellular router normally allows multiple people to connect to it (since it can route data or support multi-point to multi-point connections), while a modem is designed for one connection.|$|R

50|$|One {{interesting}} {{property of}} a load-balanced switch is that, although the mesh <b>connecting</b> line <b>cards</b> to buffers {{is required to}} <b>connect</b> every line <b>card</b> to every buffer, there is no requirement that the mesh act as a non-blocking crossbar, nor that the connections be responsive to any traffic pattern. Such a connection is far simpler than a centrally arbitrated crossbar.|$|R
