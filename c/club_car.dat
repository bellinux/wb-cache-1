25|$|The Pullman Company {{was also}} {{noted for its}} porters. The company hired black men almost {{exclusively}} for the porter positions (Men of Filipino descent were primarily hired for <b>club</b> <b>car</b> service positions). Although a porter's occupation was menial in some respects, it offered better pay and security than most jobs open to African Americans at the time, {{as well as an}} opportunity to travel the country. Many credit Pullman porters as significantly contributing to the development of America's black middle class. In 1925, Pullman porters became unionized as the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters (BSCP), founded by A. Philip Randolph. At one time Pullman was the largest employer of African Americans in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|The {{line was}} home to the last {{remaining}} private commuter passenger Club in the United States. The Jersey Shore Commuters Club was established in 1933 {{under the auspices of}} the Pennsylvania Railroad. [...] It used of half of a Comet IIM car - car 5459 (built as Comet IIB 5759 in 1988). In 2004, the Comet II <b>Club</b> <b>Car</b> went through a custom overhaul by Alstom and was furnished, with the Club's funding, to include reclining lounge chairs, spacious seating, at-seat fold down tables, and private conference tables. The Club also hosted various onboard activities to preserve its heritage. Club members enjoyed guaranteed and spacious seating as part of their annual membership fee that the Club remits to New Jersey Transit as part of its lease agreement. Membership was [...] "open" [...] and on a [...] "first come first served basis" [...] to those willing to pay the membership fee and abide by the Club's bylaws. The Club end of the car was furnished similar to Amtrak's Amfleet and Horizon fleet of cars. The <b>Club</b> <b>Car</b> seats were actually former Amfleet Metroliner seats that the Club had re-conditioned. The <b>Club</b> <b>Car</b> only ran during peak rush hour periods with one weekday round trip per day and was always run with the club end coupled to the locomotive when used. [...] Due to damage sustained to the <b>Club</b> <b>Car</b> in Hurricane Sandy, the commuter club was disbanded in August 2013. [...] Per posts on the Club's Facebook page, the <b>Club</b> <b>Car</b> took its last trip on the line in October 2012, just prior to the hurricane.|$|E

50|$|Inspired by <b>Club</b> <b>Car's</b> {{golf cart}} design and partly in {{response}} to the 1970s fuel crisis, a company called Sebring-Vanguard produced its first electric vehicle, the Vanguard Coupe (sometimes referred to as the EV Coupe), in 1974.

Amtrak experimented with sleeping car conversions in the 1970s but did not pursue the idea. The Amfleet I has vestibules on both ends of the car for faster unloading, while the Amfleet II has a single vestibule. The Amfleet II also has slightly larger windows.|$|R

2500|$|When {{the train}} {{stopped in the}} tunnel due to a fire, the {{procedure}} was that the smoke {{had to be removed}} by the high powered ventilation before evacuation could be allowed.

[...] The evacuation procedure is now shown in nine languages in the lorry driver's <b>club</b> <b>car.</b> [...] Eurotunnel was also concerned because it took 75minutes before the fire services started to tackle the blaze and that the ventilation was on during this time, fanning the fire and increasing the damage. After tests in April 2010, Eurotunnel built four [...] "fire-fighting stations" [...] in the tunnel.

2500|$|The South Stand is {{also known}} as the [...] "Main Stand", however some fans still refer to it as the [...] "Laver Stand" [...] (after the stand's {{long-term}} sponsors in the 1990s) or even the [...] "New Stand" [...] by many older fans since there was no stand on the South end of the pitch until 1975, where previously it was used as the cricket pitch's outfield. Opened in August 1975, the South Stand is situated alongside the pitch and is for home fans who wish to have a side-view when watching the match (the John Street Stand is for families only). During the 2005–06 season, this stand was renovated, with a re-clad of the outside of the stand and the old wooden seats replaced by newer plastic seats forming an emblem of two swords written. The box-seats were also upgraded, and since the stand then has been under three different sponsorship deals (currently GAC Logistics).
