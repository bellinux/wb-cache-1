5|$|After {{a four-month}} investigation, the {{criminal}} justice branch of the Attorney General of British Columbia announced formal charges of assault causing bodily harm against Bertuzzi on June 24, 2004. With the charge, Bertuzzi faced up to one-and-a-half years in prison. Bertuzzi pleaded guilty to the assault charge on December 22 after arranging a plea bargain with prosecutors. He was given a conditional discharge requiring 80 {{hours of community service}} and one year's probation that additionally prohibited him from playing in any hockey game Moore was competing in. Under Canadian law, Bertuzzi's successful completion of his probationary period precluded him from a criminal record. Moore expressed disappointment regarding Bertuzzi's discharge and was upset that he was unable to attend the <b>court</b> <b>date,</b> having to issue a written victim statement instead. Moore's lawyer, Tim Danson, was given one day's notice of the <b>court</b> <b>date</b> following Bertuzzi's plea bargain, which he said was insufficient time for Moore to travel to Vancouver.|$|E

Miss Iovenko arrives, telling the FBI that she passed her bar exam three days ago and is acting as Josh's attorney.
