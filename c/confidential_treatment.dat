This article reports the results of an investigation of the information used by legislators to determine the age at which minors may consent to treatment. Evidence indicates that in four states lawmakers considered the advice of mental health professionals before making age determinations. In six states “consistency with other state laws ” or “precedence ” was the lawmakers ’ major consideration. In five states, the main concern was removing legal barriers to treatment access. Lawmakers from several states had no independent recollection regarding the motives behind age selection. When deciding on the age at which minors would be allowed to consent to substance abuse treatment, some state legislators based their decisions on clinical data or legal facts. Some, however, appear to have made decisions without a clear foundation. J Am Acad Psychiatry Law 35 : 317 – 22, 2007 In a recent publication, the lack of consensus among U.

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} three {{essays on}} market microstructure. Chapter 1 studies how endogenous information acquisition affects financial markets by modelling potentially informed traders who optimally acquire variable information at increasing cost. Prices affect the informed trading by providing incentives for acquiring information. Endogenous information acquisition explains the stylised facts that informed trading and transaction volume spike after informational events and fall over time. My model also tells {{a cautionary tale}} for interpreting measures of informed trading. Three common empirical proxies derived under the exogenous assumption (spreads, Easley O'Hara's PIN and blockholder interest) {{do not agree with}} each other in my setup. Chapter 2 develops a more general framework with endogenous information acquisition which I use to examine the behaviour of an optimal monopolistic market maker. Unlike a competitive market maker, he sets prices to increase information revelation which is valuable to him. I characterise market information structure by whether narrower or wider spreads increase the information revealed by trades. An optimal monopolistic market maker may behave differently from the standard exogenous information benchmark. He may set narrower spreads in early periods. On average, spreads may widen over time. The different results arise from the interaction of a monopolistic market maker with endogenous information acquisition. Chapter 3 studies the impact of <b>confidential</b> <b>treatment</b> requests made by institutional investors to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to delay disclosure of their holdings. The SEC requires the manager to present a coherent on-going trading program in his request for <b>confidential</b> <b>treatment.</b> If granted, he is restricted to trade {{in a manner consistent with}} his reported forecast in the subsequent period.

40|$|Abstract Background As {{with the}} general population, a {{proportion}} of military personnel with mental health problems do not seek help. As the military is a profession {{at high risk of}} occupational psychiatric injury, understanding barriers to help-seeking is a priority. Method Participants were drawn from a large UK military health study. Participants undertook a telephone interview including the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ); a short measure of PTSD (Primary Care PTSD, PC-PTSD); a series of questions about service utilisation; and barriers to care. The response rate was 76 % (821 participants). Results The most common barriers to care reported are those relating to the anticipated public stigma associated with consulting for a mental health problem. In addition, participants reported barriers in the practicalities of consulting such as scheduling an appointment and having time off for treatment. Barriers to care {{did not appear to be}} diminished after people leave the Armed Forces. Veterans report additional barriers to care of not knowing where to find help and a concern that their employer would blame them for their problems. Those with mental health problems, such as PTSD, report significantly more barriers to care than those who do not have a diagnosis of a mental disorder. Conclusions Despite recent efforts to de-stigmatise mental disorders in the military, anticipated stigma and practical barriers to consulting stand in the way of access to care for some Service personnel. Further interventions to reduce stigma and ensuring that Service personnel have access to high quality <b>confidential</b> assessment and <b>treatment</b> remain priorities for the UK Armed Forces. </p...|$|R

Jervis Street has been in existence since 1970 and provides <b>confidential</b> and free <b>treatment.</b> The following information was abstracted from patients' records for the years 1979 - 1983. During those years a total of 2, 057 patients made first contact with the Jervis Street Drug Centre. Of those, 1, 440 attended because of the abuse of opiates, primarily heroin with the numbers of males exceeding the number of females by three to one for the years of the study. The number of attenders increased during these five years from 294 in 1979 to 1, 314 in 1983. This trend confirms the fears of an alarming increase in the abuse of opiates in Dublin since 1979. There is also a trend towards younger age of attenders over the five years. In comparison between heroin users and an age and sex standardised control population in north central Dublin, the heroin users were less likely to socialise, were less influenced by family and had a much poorer educational and employment record. They {{were also more likely to}} smoke and smoke heavily and less likely to drink. However they were also more likely to have been arrested for a variety of offences and to have lost one or both parents through death than their counterparts in the control group.

40|$|The Teenage Pregnancy Strategy {{launched}} in 1999 by the New Labour government called for renewed {{attention to a}} problem which {{was identified as a}} public health issue and as a cause of social exclusion. From the beginning its implementation focused on providing Sex and Relationship Education as well as easy access to sexual health services. The Guidance for Healthcare Professionals issued in 2004 particularly insists on the importance of offering a friendly and non-judgemental approach, and <b>confidential</b> advice and <b>treatment</b> to young people. Although the Strategy was constantly monitored and, along the years, a certain evolution can be seen, these two remain the key elements to deal successfully with this important issue. Moreover, a close analysis of the many documents published, the results achieved and the chosen approach, raises some questions about the importance given to autonomy, confidentiality and consent in public health, and to the way the promotion of behaviour change is understood, and how the issue relates to the whole of society. Considering teenage pregnancy as a result of social inequalities, more than a cause of it, could lead to an approach more focused on dealing effectively with social inequalities. Besides, the importance of personal responsibility in relation to society, as intended by “Civic Republicanism”, could overcome the individual responsibility as understood within the liberal approach. The awareness of being members of a society in which we are all interdependent and responsible for our personal flourishing {{as well as that of}} society, may provide the right motivations both for young people to overcome the individualistic attitude of pursuing only one’s pleasure while avoiding adverse outcomes, and for professionals to take greater responsibility in offering significant support to young people, beyond merely complying with the requirements of their professional duties...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} {{variation}} in surgical and adjuvant treatment of breast cancer of known histology and detected on screening in a large cohort of patients treated by the surgeons of a health region. DESIGN: Part prospective, part retrospective observational study using the databases of a region's breast screening programme and of the cancer registry. SETTING: The former South East Thames region. SUBJECTS: 600 women aged 49 - 79 who presented during 1991 - 2 with invasive breast cancer {{up to 20 mm}} in diameter that had been detected on screening. These patients were treated by 35 surgeons. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mastectomy rate by surgeon and the use of adjuvant treatment (radiotherapy, tamoxifen, and chemotherapy) were compared with risk factors, tumour grade, resection margins, and axillary node status. RESULTS: The mastectomy rate varied between nil and 80 %, although the numbers at these extremes were small (0 / 13 v 8 / 10). Surgeons operating on more than 20 such cases had a lower mastectomy rate (15 %) than surgeons treating fewer cases (23 %), but this difference was confounded by variation in casemix. There were also wide variations in mastectomy rates and in axillary sampling rates that were independent of casemix or caseload. There was broad agreement on the use of adjuvant tamoxifen (94 %), but few patients received chemotherapy (2. 5 %). 78 patients (19 %) did not receive radiotherapy, including 51 out of 317 patients with unfavourable tumours, and 26 patients did not receive tamoxifen. Whether the patient received adjuvant treatment was more dependent on referral by the surgeon than the risk factors for local recurrence and was independent of caseload. CONCLUSION: Mastectomy rates for similar tumours vary widely by surgeon independently of casemix or caseload, but surgeons with a higher caseload tend to have a lower mastectomy rate. Omission of postoperative radiotherapy or tamoxifen after conservative treatment is not related to risk factors for local recurrence or caseload. <b>Confidential</b> feedback of <b>treatment</b> profiles to individual surgeons has been used, but when benefit has been established treatment should be guided by evidence based protocol...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explores the}} extent to which factors related to individuals, the care {{provision}} process, and the cultural context influence the behaviour of tuberculosis patients attending TB clinics in rural Pakistan, and examines the effects of disease on their personal lives. Thirty-six patients attending three TB treatment clinics were interviewed in depth. These patients were stratified by stage of treatment (treatment proceeding, treatment completed, default), sex and by rural/urban status. Results indicate that the majority of patients were very poor, but nonetheless initially chose to attend private practitioners. Normally their disease was correctly diagnosed as tuberculosis only after repeated visits to a succession of health care providers. Patients' knowledge about their disease was limited, and doctors gave incorrect or only very limited health education. Most patients reported dissatisfaction with care provided. Almost all patients reported problems with access to treatment, both in terms of time and money; this was particularly true of women, whose freedom to travel in Pakistan is limited. Potential causes of default appeared to be more closely linked to deficiencies in treatment provision rather than patients' unwillingness to comply. Largely because of a perception that TB was incurable, respondents were generally unwilling to disclose that they were undergoing or had undergone TB treatment. For reasons related to <b>confidential</b> access to <b>treatment,</b> this could lead to default, perpetuating the perception of incurability, and hence causing a vicious circle. For TB programmes to be successful in Pakistan, it is essential that this circle is broken; and this can only be done through provision of good quality TB care and education to improve the population's understanding that TB can be cured. In addition, patients' unwillingness to disclose to health care providers that they had already received previous treatment meant that many patients were prescribed incorrect treatment regimes, potentially leading to the emergence of drug-resistant TB. In common with other researchers' findings, no clear differences were found between those who had completed treatment and those who had defaulted from treatment. This study was performed to provide information to assist the researchers to design potential TB treatment delivery strategies, and has proved invaluable for this purpose. Strategies based on findings from the study are currently being assessed using a randomised controlled trial. Tuberculosis Developing countries DOTS Pakistan...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} how the Securities and Exchange Commission balances competing regulatory objectives in its decisions to approve requests to withhold proprietary information from firms' financial reports. The <b>confidential</b> <b>treatment</b> process requires the SEC {{to balance the}} public interest in protecting proprietary information with the public interest in promoting disclosures to investors. I draw upon {{the economic and political}} science literatures on regulatory decision-making to test the strength of these interests on three aspects of the SEC's decisions to grant confidential treatment: the duration of time required to approve the request, the duration of time the SEC agrees to protect proprietary information from disclosure, and whether the firm is successful in securing <b>confidential</b> <b>treatment</b> for all redacted information. I find that the public interest in promoting disclosure and protecting proprietary information influence different aspects of the SEC's decisions to grant regulatory exemptions for <b>confidential</b> <b>treatment.</b> Firms requiring greater monitoring by the SEC receive greater scrutiny and have lower odds of successful redaction. High proprietary costs are associated with significantly longer protection periods but proprietary costs generally are not associated with duration to approval or the success of the application. Finally, I find that the SEC applies greater scrutiny to firms exhibiting objective and salient measures of low financial reporting quality although these firms have higher odds of success. These findings are consistent with the SEC reviewing CTRs {{to reduce the risk of}} legislative oversight. This study contributes to the literature on disclosure regulation by providing evidence as to how securities regulators balance competing interests when reviewing requests for disclosure exemptions. These findings also contribute to the role of political influence on disclosure policy, as the SEC's exemption decisions are consistent with avoiding the threat of legislative oversight. Second, these findings contribute to the literature on the SEC's regulatory decisions by demonstrating that the SEC staff appears to allocate resources and apply scrutiny to applications for disclosure exemptions using aspects of registered firms' financial reporting quality. Third, these findings contribute to the literature on redaction as a disclosure choice by providing evidence suggesting that firms with low financial reporting quality are more likely to redact, and I provide evidence on the success of this disclosure choice. Overall, these findings suggest that the public interest in promoting disclosure, as well as the threat of legislative oversight, influence the SECs decisions when granting regulatory exemptions to protect proprietary information...|$|E
40|$|I {{examine the}} {{implications}} of nondisclosure in a setting {{where there is a}} credible signal as to the proprietary nature of the undisclosed information. Specifically, I investigate the market and analysts' response to firms’ application to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a <b>confidential</b> <b>treatment</b> order (CTO), which allows firms to redact required disclosures from SEC filings when the redacted information is proprietary. I find that the market and analysts react favorably to the voluntary nondisclosure of proprietary information using the SEC <b>confidential</b> <b>treatment</b> process. Market and analysts reactions are more favorable to the redaction of information that is more likely to have proprietary value, such as information related to research and development. In addition, I show that the redacting firms experience superior accounting performance compared to their peers in the years following the redaction, consistent with the market and analysts’ response to the redaction. However, I find that analysts engage in more intense private information search in response to a CTO redaction. This finding suggests that, although a CTO redaction can signal the nature of undisclosed information, analysts believe that the signal is not fully revealing of the economic magnitude of the undisclosed information. Overall, this study’s findings indicate that a firm's willingness to submit to the CTO approval process serves as a credible signal of the proprietary nature of the withheld information. The {{results of this study suggest}} a possible role for a credible signaling channel to facilitate communication between insiders and outsiders regarding the nature of withheld information...|$|E

40|$|Publicly-traded {{companies}} {{have the power}} to pass sunlight bylaws to address hedge fund activism. Sunlight bylaws would require activist hedge funds to publicly disclose any strategic proposals and their financial interests in companies earlier and at thresholds lower than current securities laws. Sunlight bylaws would also require disclosure of additional information, including: (1) the percentage of the fund’s portfolio invested in the company; (2) the fund manager’s compensation; (3) the fund manager’s investment in the fund; (4) the fund’s portfolio turnover; and (5) the fund’s prior holding periods after any announcements of an ownership interest and a strategic proposal. Academic proponents of hedge fund activism defend activism based on the theory that activist hedge fund managers are systematically better agents for long-term stockholders than the incumbent board and executive management. These proponents argue that fund managers have large stakes in their funds, the funds’ profitability is highly contingent on the financial performance of its investments, and the funds hold relatively few concentrated investments. Sunlight bylaws would target factual information essential to that claim and require its disclosure in succinct, summary form. Sunlight bylaws would also state that if a stockholder violates them, that stockholder cannot nominate a candidate for a seat on the board or propose any issue for the next stockholders’ vote. But institutional investors and proxy advisory firms support hedge fund activism in the abstract, and a board that passed a sunlight bylaw might precipitate litigation or a proxy fight.

They describe the flexible range of clinical responses that therapists have utilized, {{as well as their}} professional concerns about preserving patient confidentiality (or at least strictly circumscribing the scope of disclosure when confidentiality must be breached). A recent case is reported that illustrates a striking new extension of Tarasoff, involving a police search and seizure of a psychotherapist's <b>confidential</b> <b>treatment</b> records and tapes, in response to a third-party complaint that the records contained evidence of his patients ' violent acts and propensities. The implications of this case are that the therapist's discretion in the assessment of his duty to protect, the selection of a proper course of action, and the implementation of specific responses may be taken out of his hands, for all intents and purposes, and expropriated by law and order officials. Moreover, regardless of whatever clinical approach he adopts and whether or not he issues a warning, his attempts to preserve patient confidentiality are bound to prove unsuccessful in any future legal proceedings.

40|$|International audienceThe {{primary purpose}} of this study was to {{investigate}} the effectiveness of the virtual environment technology in the area of psychotherapy. Consequently, this study investigated the effectiveness of a virtual environment desensitization (VED) in the treatment of agoraphobia (fear of being in places or situations from which escape might be difficult or embarrassing). It was done with a traditional experimental design using N= 60 subjects. Thirty subjects were placed in the experimental group and thirty subjects were placed in the control group. Two instruments were used: an Attitude Towards Agoraphobia Questionnaire (ATAQ) and the Subjective Unit of Discomfort Scale (SUDS). Only subjects in the experimental group were exposed to the VED treatment. The virtual environment desensitization was shown to be effective in treatment of subjects with agoraphobia (experimental group). The control group, or no-treatment group, did not change significantly. All the attitudes towards agoraphobic situation decreased significantly for the virtual environment desensitization group (experimental group) but not for control group. The average SUDS in each session decreased steadily across sessions, indicating habituation. This research, including the pilot studies, has established a new paradigm for utilizing virtual environment technology in the effective, economical, and <b>confidential</b> <b>treatment</b> of psychological disorders...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{exploits}} {{the recent}} rise in corporate venture capitalists (CVC) {{to examine the}} effect of shareholders’ strategic incentives on firms’ IPO disclosure. CVCs’ investments are often driven by both financial and strategic incentives. I argue that, due to their strategic incentives, CVCs may influence their portfolio firms’ disclosure choices to protect proprietary information and avoid competitive harm not only to the portfolio firm but also to the CVC parent. Using a sample of venture capital (VC) -backed IPO firms from 1996 to 2014, I find that CVC-backed firms are more likely to redact material information in IPO prospectuses through <b>confidential</b> <b>treatment</b> orders than firms not backed by CVCs—the likelihood of redaction is 16 % higher when a CVC is present. This result is robust to using propensity score matching and an instrumental variables approach. Furthermore, the disclosure effect is more pronounced for CVCs in the same industry as the portfolio firm, CVCs with a formal strategic partnership with the portfolio firm, and CVCs with fewer portfolio firms. These findings suggest that CVCs’ strategic incentives {{play an important role in}} their portfolio firms’ disclosure choices. CVC-backed firms are also more likely to redact information contained in agreements with collaborative partners, customers, or suppliers and in agreements associated with the CVC parents, which tend to contain proprietary information about the CVC. Taken together, this study offers new insights on how a previously unexplored factor—large shareholders’ strategic incentives—affects corporate disclosure decisions...|$|E
