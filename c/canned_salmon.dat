5|$|For {{thousands}} of years, salmon was a reliable food source for Native Americans living along the Rogue. Salmon migrations were so huge that early settlers claimed {{they could hear}} the fish moving upstream. These large runs continued into the 20thcentury despite damage to spawning beds caused by gold mining in the 1850s and large-scale commercial fishing that began shortly thereafter. The fishing industry fed demands for salmon in the growing cities of Portland and San Francisco and for <b>canned</b> <b>salmon</b> in England.|$|E
