40|$|ABSTRACT The {{absorption}} of nonheme iron from nine common Western type breakfasts was studied in 129 subjects using extrinsic labeling with radioiron. In one group the iron absorption from a <b>continental</b> type of <b>breakfast</b> served with coffee was standardized against the absorption from a reference dose of ferrous ascorbate (3 mg Fe). In all subsequent experiments the absorption from this breakfast was compared {{with one of}} the other breakfast meals served on alternate days and each labeled with a different radioiron isotope. The bioavailability of iron in the different breakfast meals varied markedly. There was almost a 6 -fold difference in absorption (0. 07 to 0. 40 mg) despite {{of the fact that the}} iron content only varied from 2. 8 to 4. 2 mg. The most marked effect was seen with tea which reduced the absorption to less than half and with orange juice which increased the absorption two and a half times. The present findings must be considered when giving dietary advice to groups of subjects who are known to have a critical iron balance. The present results also imply that an evaluation of the iron nutrition in a population cannot only be based on the daily dietary intake of iron but must also include the bioavailability of iron in frequently consumed meals.
