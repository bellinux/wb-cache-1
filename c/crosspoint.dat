2500|$|On December 4, 2006, in The Spectrum, a {{publication}} of the University at Buffalo (UB), it was announced that John B. Simpson, who was the school's president at the time, was planning to get a project underway that would connect UB's North, South and downtown campuses via a transportation system. The proposed systems included a subway, trolley or light rail. A study, published in 2014, detailed four alternatives chosen for the corridor, including a light rail corridor and three bus rapid transit corridors. The light rail corridor would extend from a turnout at University Station, head north to Niagara Falls Boulevard, turn to Sweet Home Road, enter the University at Buffalo North Campus and parallel Interstate 990 ending at the <b>Crosspoint</b> Business Park in Getzville. Planning and funding is currently underway for a northbound Niagara Falls Boulevard extension to the University at Buffalo North Campus.|$|E

50|$|A {{standard}} problem in using crossbar switches {{is that of}} setting the <b>crosspoints.</b> In the classic telephony application of crossbars, the <b>crosspoints</b> are closed, and open as the telephone calls come and go. In Asynchronous Transfer Mode or packet switching applications, the <b>crosspoints</b> must be made and broken at each decision interval. In high-speed switches, the settings {{of all of the}} <b>crosspoints</b> must be determined and then set millions or billions of times per second. One approach for making these decisions quickly is {{through the use of a}} wavefront arbiter.|$|R
50|$|In February 2009, <b>Crosspoints</b> BV {{was ordered}} by the Radiocommunications Agency to cease Arrow Classic Rock {{broadcasting}} on the FM frequencies across the Netherlands by March 11 after a dispute about licence fees. Because {{of the financial crisis}} <b>Crosspoints</b> BV was not longer able to pay millions for licence fees to the Dutch government for the distribution of a special interest music station. After FM-distribution stopped, Arrow Classic Rock was still broadcasting via all Dutch cable networks, online and on AM 828 kHz 24 hours a day.

50|$|Because the {{individual}} <b>crosspoints</b> were {{more expensive than}} those of crossbar switches, while the control circuitry was cheaper, reed arrays usually had fewer <b>crosspoints</b> and were more numerous. This required them to be arranged in more stages. Thus, while a telephone call in a typical crossbar exchange like 5XB passed through four switches, a call in a reed system such as 1ESS typically passed through eight.|$|R

5000|$|Each {{input of}} the array had, besides the two talk wires, a P lead for {{controlling}} the crosspoints on that level. Two coils on each <b>crosspoint</b> were {{wired in series}} with all the others on that level, to the P lead. Each output of the array also had a P lead with two coils on each <b>crosspoint</b> of that output level. The two windings controlled by the same level were unequal, and were wound around {{opposite ends of the}} reed, in opposing polarity. When a pulse passed through the crosspoints of a level, the two ends of each reed were magnetized north to north or south to south, thus repelled each other and opened the <b>crosspoint</b> in all except the selected <b>crosspoint.</b>|$|E

50|$|The voice {{switching}} fabric plan {{was similar to}} that of the earlier 5XB switch in being bidirectional and in using the call-back principle. The largest full access matrix switches in the system, however, were 8x8 rather than 10x10 or 20x16. Thus they required eight stages rather than four to achieve large enough junctor groups in a large office. <b>Crosspoints</b> being more expensive in the new system but switches cheaper, system cost was minimized with fewer <b>crosspoints</b> organized into more switches. The fabric was divided into Line Networks and Trunk Networks of four stages, and partially folded to allow connecting line-to-line or trunk-to-trunk without exceeding eight stages of switching.|$|R

40|$|In this research, a new {{approach}} to an optimal design of strictly Non-blocking Multistage Recursive (NMR) interconnection networks and then a CNMR (Clos NMR) is introduced. In designing strictly non-blocking multistage interconnection networks the three factors: number of switching elements or <b>crosspoints</b> (C N), maximum number of <b>crosspoints</b> or switching elements on signal transfer path (P N) and maximum number of connection may tolerance while passing from input to output (S N), play a significant and important role as far as hardware cost, fault tolerance, scalability and routing complexity. These factors are computed and displayed through applying mathematical formula and equations of multistage interconnection networks crossbar, benes, clos, NMR and CNMR. These factors are indicated to be more optimal values in proposed of NMR and CNMR than other multistage interconnection networks with the values being O (NN), O (log 2 N) and a constant value respectively. Therefore, as a result of decreasing the complexity of internal connections and the number of <b>crosspoints</b> or switching elements which are needed in signal transfer path, this network can be used in the multistage interconnection network switches of circuit switching and packet switching with the various sizes...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Recently, a new {{preconditioning}} {{technique for}} the FETI method {{based upon a}} coarse grid problem associated with interface <b>crosspoints</b> has been introduced [MTF]. This gives optimal convergence property for high-order problems. In the present paper {{the problem of the}} parallel implementation of this new preconditioning technique is addressed and the performance of this approach is demonstrated for real life structural analysis problems. For fourth-order problems, like plate or shell problems, the singularity with interface <b>crosspoints,</b> that means nodes that belongs to more than two subdomains, deteriorates the condition number of the dual Schur complement operator, the condensed interface operator defining the FETI method [FR 94]. A new preconditioning technique leading to a two-level handling of interface continuity requirements has been recently developed [MTF]. The independence upon the number of subdomains and the polylogarithmical dependence upon the number of el...|$|R
40|$|The feedback-based {{two-stage}} switch {{does not}} require a central scheduler and can provide close to 100 % throughput [3]. But the number of <b>crosspoints</b> required for the two stages of switch fabric is 2 N 2, and the average packet delay performance (even under light traffic load) is on the order of O(N) slots, where N is the switch size. To improve the performance of feedback-based two-stage switch when N is large, we adopt the Clos network for constructing a large switch from a set of smaller feedback-based switch modules. We call it a Clos-feedback switch. The potential problem of packet mis-sequencing is solved by using application-flow based load balancing. With recursive decomposition, a Clos network can degenerate into a Benes network. We show that for a Clos-feedback switch, the number of <b>crosspoints</b> required is reduced to 4 N(2 log 2 N- 1) and the average packet delay is cut down to O(log 2 N) slots. © 2012 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

50|$|In {{the field}} of telecommunications, a Clos network {{is a kind of}} {{multistage}} circuit switching network, first formalized by Charles Clos in 1952, which represents a theoretical idealization of practical multi-stage telephone switching systems. Clos networks are required when the physical circuit switching needs to exceed the capacity of the largest feasible single crossbar switch. The key advantage of Clos networks is that the number of <b>crosspoints</b> (which make up each crossbar switch) required can be far fewer than would be the case if the entire switching system were implemented with one large crossbar switch. When the Clos network was first devised, the number of <b>crosspoints</b> was a reasonable approximate indication of the total cost of the switching system. While this was important for electromechanical crossbars, it became less relevant with the advent of VLSI, wherein the interconnects often could be implemented either directly in silicon, or within a relatively small cluster of boards. However, the advent of complex data centers, with huge interconnect structures, each based on optical fiber links, means that they are again important.|$|R
