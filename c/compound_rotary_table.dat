50|$|A <b>rotary</b> <b>table</b> is a {{mechanical}} device on a drilling rig that provides clockwise (as viewed from above) rotational {{force to the}} drill string to facilitate the process of drilling a borehole.

5000|$|The <b>rotary</b> <b>table</b> is {{also called}} a turntable. Most <b>rotary</b> <b>tables</b> are chain driven. These chains {{resemble}} very large bicycle chains. The chains require constant oiling to prevent burning and seizing. Virtually all <b>rotary</b> <b>tables</b> {{are equipped with}} a rotary lock'. Engaging the lock can either prevent the rotary from turning in one particular direction, or from turning at all. This is commonly used by crews in lieu of using a second pair of tongs to makeup or break out pipes.The rotary bushings are located {{at the center of}} the <b>rotary</b> <b>table.</b> These can generally be removed in two separate pieces to facilitate large items, i.e. drill bits, to pass through the <b>rotary</b> <b>table.</b> The large gap in the center of the rotary bushings is referred to as the [...] "bowl" [...] due to its appearance. The bowl is where the slips are set to hold up the drill string during connections and pipe trips as well as the point the drill string passes through the floor into the wellbore. The rotary bushings connect to the kelly bushings to actually induce the spin required for drilling.|$|R

40|$|We call a strapdown {{inertial}} navigation system (SINS) that uses the rotation auto-compensation technique (which is a common method to reduce {{the effect of the}} bias errors of inertial components) a ‘rotational SINS’. In a rotational SINS, the <b>rotary</b> <b>table</b> is an important component, rotating the inertial sensor assembly back and forth in azimuth to accomplish error modulation. As a consequence of the manufacturing process, errors may exist in <b>rotary</b> <b>tables</b> which decrease the navigation accuracy of rotational SINSs.

40|$|A novel {{calibration}} method is presented for a sensor fusion system in large-scale metrology, which improves the calibration efficiency and reliability. The attitude sensor {{is composed of}} a pinhole prism, a converging lens, an area-array camera and a biaxial inclinometer. A mathematical model is established to determine its three-dimensional attitude relative to a cooperative total station by using two vector observations from the imaging system and the inclinometer. The measurement model developed has two aspects to be calibrated: the intrinsic parameters of the imaging model; and the transformation matrix between the camera and the inclinometer. An integrated {{calibration method}} using a three-axis <b>rotary</b> <b>table</b> and a total station is then proposed. A single mounting position of the attitude sensor on the <b>rotary</b> <b>table</b> is sufficient to solve for all parameters of the measurement model. A correction technique for the reference laser beam of the total station removes the need for accurate positioning of the sensor on the <b>rotary</b> <b>table.</b> Calibration measurements are made at multiple angular positions of the <b>rotary</b> <b>table</b> {{in order to determine}} all the unknown parameters in the model. Experimental verification has verified the practicality and accuracy of this calibration method.

40|$|An {{automated}} {{setup for}} non-tactile high-precision measurements of roundness and cylindricity of ring gauges {{is presented in}} this paper. The aim is to overcome classical problems of tactile and radial roundness measurements such as the error influences of the used <b>rotary</b> <b>table</b> and the work piece alignment and thus to increase the accuracy and reduce the measurement time. To achieve those aims a double interferometer concept was chosen and combined with a measurement system for the work piece alignment, a high precision <b>rotary</b> <b>table</b> and an automated four-axes adjustment unit. The main alignment errors of the work pieces (e. g. ring gauges) such as eccentricity and tilting are either suppressed or directly detected and consequently reduced by the automated four-axes adjustment unit. Due to the non-tactile measurement concept and the contactless energy supply of the four-axes adjustment unit, the radial run of the <b>rotary</b> <b>table</b> is not affected.

Using the concepts of green design and manufacture, as well as sustainable development thinking, the paper highlights the advantages derived from their application in this specific field (i. e., the clever use of lightweight materials to allow ruling out high-consumption hydraulic pump systems). The design is conceived in a modular way, so that the final solution can cover transfers from four to 15 working stations. Two versions of the machines are examined.
