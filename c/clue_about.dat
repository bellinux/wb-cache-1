5|$|Because of {{the very}} faint {{luminosity}} of this galaxy, its exact distance was not measured for several years. Well before then, another major breakthrough occurred with the next event registered by BeppoSAX, GRB 970508. This event was localized within four hours of its discovery, allowing research teams to begin making observations much sooner than any previous burst. The spectrum of the object revealed a redshift of z=0.835, placing the burst {{at a distance of}} roughly 6 billionlight years from Earth. This was the first accurate determination of the distance to a GRB, and together with the discovery of the host galaxy of 970228 proved that GRBs occur in extremely distant galaxies. Within a few months, the controversy about the distance scale ended: GRBs were extragalactic events originating within faint galaxies at enormous distances. The following year, GRB 980425 was followed within a day by a bright supernova (SN 1998bw), coincident in location, indicating a clear connection between GRBs and the deaths of very massive stars. This burst provided the first strong <b>clue</b> <b>about</b> the nature of the systems that produce GRBs.|$|E

25|$|After 14 {{golden years}} at Werder Bremen, Rehhagel left to manage former hated rivals, Bayern Munich, {{before the start}} of the 1995–96 season. Prior to Rehhagel's arrival, Bayern had a disappointing, but financially lucrative season in 1994–95 (a very poor sixth place in the Bundesliga, but semi-finals in the Champions League). In the summer of 1995, Bayern spent a lot of money, buying Jürgen Klinsmann, Andreas Herzog, and others, and Rehhagel was brought in as manager to replace Giovanni Trapattoni. It was widely {{expected}} that Munich would steamroll the opposition in 1995–96, but from Day 1, Rehhagel clashed with the team and the team environment. His single-minded and occasionally eccentric ways did not mesh at all with Bayern, who quickly felt that Rehhagel was too rural at heart and had no <b>clue</b> <b>about</b> how to interact in the fancy environment of Munich. Moreover, Rehhagel's old-school tactics and patronising of the Bayern players caused major antipathy in the Bayern team, especially from Klinsmann, who never missed an opportunity to take shots at Rehhagel. Despite Rehhagel getting Bayern to the UEFA Cup final, Bayern's results in the Bundesliga dropped alarmingly in the second half of the season, and Rehhagel was famously sacked just 4 days before they were due to play in the first leg of the 1996 UEFA Cup final. Rehhagel's job was taken over by Franz Beckenbauer, who led the team to victory in the 1996 UEFA Cup final, and oversaw an upturn in form in the last couple of weeks in the Bundesliga, but Bayern finished second, as Borussia Dortmund won their second German championship in a row.|$|E
500|$|A <b>clue</b> <b>about</b> {{who played}} Euridice is {{contained}} in a 1608 letter to Duke Vincenzo. It refers to [...] "that little priest who performed the role of Euridice in the Most Serene Prince's Orfeo". This priest was possibly Padre Girolamo Bacchini, a castrato known to have had connections to the Mantuan court in the early 17th century. The Monteverdi scholar Tim Carter speculates that two prominent Mantuan tenors, Pandolfo Grande and Francesco Campagnola may have sung minor roles in the premiere.|$|E

"In her 'Judas' video, Lady Gaga plays {{fast and}} loose with Catholic iconography, and generates several {{untoward}} statements, but she typically dances on the line without going over it. The faux-baptismal scene is a curious inclusion, as is her apparent fondness for the Jesus character. But if anyone thinks the Catholic League is going to go ballistic over Lady Gaga's latest contribution, they haven't a <b>clue</b> <b>about</b> what really constitutes anti-Catholicism.

[...] Harrison says: [...] "The appearance of episode 1 was unusual enough but could be explained as an extended break between verse and refrain sections. Episode 2 however, makes that interpretation untenable, and both listener and analyst must entertain the idea that 'Good Vibrations' develops under its own power, as it were, without the guidance of overdetermined formal patterns. Brian’s own description of the song—a three-and-a-half-minute 'pocket symphony'—is a telling <b>clue</b> <b>about</b> his formal ambitions here." ...|$|E

[...] Roberts explains, [...] " [...] has such a firm grasp of his goal that scarcely a word is extraneous... You feel you've read volumes, though, {{not just because of}} the density of Wright's thoughts, but due to the crushing weight of the burden they carry. In prose that is balefully evocative and irreducibly precise..." [...] On the other hand, in the National Post review, Peter Foster gave a negative review, chiding Wright for [...] "not having the slightest <b>clue</b> <b>about</b> how economies work, or how, by their fundamental nature, markets are both moral and sustainable."

500|$|In {{the book}} , Philip Jenkins said that A Moral Reckoning, along with anti-Catholic {{conspiracy}} theories and other [...] "anti-Church historical polemic", {{belongs to the}} pseudohistory category of books about anti-Catholic [...] "mythic history", historical manipulation, and national demonization, such as the Black Legend about Spain, said that publishers publish such books because the sell many copies, not because they mean to [...] "destroy or calumniate Catholicism". Furthermore, Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights president William A. Donohue, said that Daniel Goldhagen [...] "hasn't a <b>clue</b> <b>about</b> Catholicism", that he [...] "separates himself" [...] from other critics of Pope Pius XII [...] "by demanding that the Catholic Church implode: he wants the Church to refigure its teachings, liturgy, and practices {{to such an extent}} that no one would recognize a trace of Catholicism in this new construction. That is why Goldhagen is not simply against Pope Pius XII: he is an inveterate anti-Catholic bigot." [...] Moreover, Rabbi Dalin accused Goldhagen of engaging in a [...] "misuse of the Holocaust to advance ... anti-Catholic agenda".|$|E
500|$|Watson's {{performance}} {{was characterized by}} some quirks. In one instance, Watson repeated a reworded version of an incorrect response offered by Jennings. (Jennings said [...] "What are the '20s?" [...] {{in reference to the}} 1920s. Then Watson said [...] "Whathe 1920s?") Because Watson could not recognize other contestants' responses, it did not know that Jennings had already given the same response. In another instance, Watson was initially given credit for a response of [...] "What is leg?" [...] after Jennings incorrectly responded [...] "What is: he only had one hand?" [...] to a <b>clue</b> <b>about</b> George Eyser (the correct response was, [...] "What is: he's missing a leg?"). Because Watson, unlike a human, could not have been responding to Jennings's mistake, it was decided that this response was incorrect. The broadcast version of the episode was edited to omit Trebek's original acceptance of Watson's response. Watson also demonstrated complex wagering strategies on the Daily Doubles, with one bet at $6,435 and another at $1,246. Gerald Tesauro, one of the IBM researchers who worked on Watson, explained that Watson's wagers were based on its confidence level for the category and a complex regression model called the Game State Evaluator.|$|E

500|$|Critics were {{retrospective}} of both Rachel and of Baxendale's performance when the series ended. In the New Statesman, Andrew Billen wrote that Rachel [...] "was as near to a sex symbol as this comedy drama about six cold-footed yuppies produced. She was also materialistic, unfaithful, self-absorbed, tricky {{and had not}} the first <b>clue</b> <b>about</b> men [...] Yet her death, caused by a moment of carelessness behind the wheel, was powerful and shocking, {{a tribute to the}} extent to which we have invested and believed in her." [...] Observer critic Kathryn Flett noted that Baxendale's high-profile role in Friends made her the [...] "star" [...] of Cold Feet in the first series, but both she and Rachel had been [...] "eclipsed" [...] by the other actors and characters by the time of the final series. Spectator critic Simon Hoggart wrote, [...] "I wasn't as sorry about poor old Rachel as I should have been. It was one of those deaths which makes you think, 'Oh, her poor baby boy,' rather than 'Goodness, how we'll miss her.'" [...] Hoggart attributed his ambivalence to Baxendale's portrayal of the character as a [...] "fraught, snippy" [...] woman. Matt Greenhalgh, who co-wrote the episode featuring Rachel's death, called killing off the character [...] "a privilege".|$|E
500|$|Nikki and Paulo {{were killed}} off due to being disliked by much of Losts fan base. Show runner Damon Lindelof {{admitted}} that the couple were [...] "universally despised" [...] by fans. Lindelof explained that [...] "back when we (the producers) had more good faith with the audience, we could have gotten away with these shenanigans. Given the backlash against them, we had {{to clean up the}} mess." [...] The decision to kill them off in one flashback episode was decided by the producers in December 2006. It was also stated by Lindelof and fellow show runners Carlton Cuse that despite Nikki and Paulo's bad reception, they felt the episode was necessary to explain their original plan of introducing former background characters to the main cast. Lindelof suggested having the characters be buried alive. Although actress Kiele Sanchez said that she wasn't bothered by the general dislike of her character, she was very nervous during the burial scene, because she has claustrophobia. Speculation about the duo's deaths began months before the actual episode aired. Santoro {{said in an interview with}} Brazilian Rolling Stone that his character was going to die in the middle of the third season. Another <b>clue</b> <b>about</b> the deaths came when it was announced that Sanchez was signed on to film a fall 2007 pilot for the ABC show, Football Wives.|$|E
500|$|When Griffin {{pitched the}} idea for the show to Lin Bolen, then the head of NBC's daytime {{programming}} division, she approved, but wanted the show to have more glamour to attract the female audience. She suggested that Griffin incorporate a shopping element into the gameplay, and so, in 1973, he created a pilot episode titled Shopper's Bazaar, with Chuck Woolery as host and Mike Lawrence as announcer. The pilot started with the three contestants being introduced individually, with Lawrence describing the prizes that they chose to play for. The main game was played to four rounds, with the values on the wheel wedges increasing after the second round. Unlike the show it evolved into, Shopper's Bazaar had a vertically mounted wheel, which was spun by Woolery rather than by the contestants. This wheel lacked the Bankrupt wedge and featured a wedge where a contestant could call a vowel for free, as well as a [...] "Your Own Clue" [...] wedge that allowed contestants to pick up a rotary telephone and hear a private <b>clue</b> <b>about</b> the puzzle. At the end of the game, the highest-scoring contestant would play a bonus round called the [...] "Shopper's Special" [...] where all the vowels in the puzzle were already there, and the contestant had 30 seconds to call out consonants in the puzzle.|$|E
