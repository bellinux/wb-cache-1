40|$|Machine {{tools are}} an {{indispensable}} link in high-efficiency high-tech production. However, since five-axis machine tools are very costly {{and their use}} requires {{a high level of}} knowledge and expertise, a virtual machine tool must be used to simulate five-axis machine tool <b>operation.</b> <b>Configuration</b> <b>code</b> or a mechanism topology matrix must be used to describe a machine tool, and can be used as the framework for design of a virtual machine tool system. The first step is to isolate the basic motions of each element of a virtual machine tool and then establish their coordinate systems. The establishment of a node tree allows coordinate transformation matrices for virtual motion components to be derived, which are then used to simulate movements. The simulation of virtual cutting must take into consideration both accuracy and efficiency. While either a GPU or CPU can be used to perform calculations, there are currently restrictions on GPU memory use which results in relatively lower accuracy. In contrast, a CPU can perform calculations using an adaptive octree with voxels and multithreading to yield sufficient accuracy and efficiency. A five-axis virtual machine tool motion and virtual cutting simulation system was written in C/C++ with OpenGL and OpenMP, and can perform real-time cutting simulations...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. A {{drive is}} one of the basic {{elements}} of belt conveyers. To determine the drive power it is necessary to conduct calculations by standard methodologies expounded in modern technical literature. Such calculations demand a fair amount of time. The basic design parameters of a belt conveyer include type of load, design efficiency, geometrical dimensions and path <b>configuration,</b> <b>operation</b> conditions. The article aims to build the parametric dependence of belt conveyer drive power on its design parameters, that takes into account standard dimensions and parameters of belts, idlers and pulleys. Methodology. The work examines a belt conveyer with two areas: sloping and horizontal. Using the methodology for pulling calculation by means of belt conveyer encirclement, there are built parametric dependences of pull forces in the characteristic conveyer path points on the type of load, design efficiency, geometrical dimensions and path <b>configuration,</b> <b>operation</b> conditions. Findings. For the belt conveyers of the considered type there are built parametric dependences of drive power on type of load, design efficiency, geometrical dimensions and path <b>configuration,</b> <b>operation</b> conditions, taking into account the belt standard dimensions and corresponding assumptions in relation to idler and pulley types. Originality. This is the first developed parametric dependence of two-area (sloping and horizontal) belt conveyer drive power on type of load, design efficiency, geometrical dimensions and path <b>configuration,</b> <b>operation</b> conditions that takes into account standard dimensions and parameters of belts, idlers and pulleys. Practical value. Use of the built drive power dependences on design parameters for the belt conveyers with sloping and horizontal areas gives an opportunity of relatively rapid determination of drive power approximate value at the design stage. Also it allows quality selection of its basic elements at specific design characteristics and requirements. The offered dependences can be used for determination of general character of drive power dependence on the project efficiency. ...|$|R
