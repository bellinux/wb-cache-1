Although posters, a video and consultation documents were published, {{the promotion of the}} <b>consultation,</b> <b>provision</b> of information such as the waste problem, alternatives, opportunities and potential solutions were inadequate. Also, important issues such as charging method, fee amount and legislation process scheme were not mentioned. Thus more discussion was needed for successful implementation. Also, the public consultation was “one-way” - it was mostly the government collecting public views. Applying two-way communication using top-down approaches might be more appropriate, such that responses could be more active and the public could have more interaction with government, ultimately enhancing government legitimacy.|$|E

The project was eventually successful with the May 9, 1963 launch, with radio transmissions {{carried by the}} man-made ring. However, the technology was ultimately shelved, partially due {{to the development of}} the modern communications satellite and partially due to protests from other scientists. The needles were placed in medium Earth orbit between 3500 and(-) 3800 km high at 96 and 87 degree inclinations and contributed to Earth's orbital debris.British radio astronomers, together with optical astronomers and the Royal Astronomical Society, protested this action. The Soviet newspaper Pravda also joined the protests under the headline [...] "U.S.A. Dirties Space".The issue was raised in the United Nations where then US Ambassador to the UN Adlai Stevenson defended the project.Stevenson studied the published journal articles on Project West Ford. Using what he learned on the subject and citing the articles he had read, he successfully allayed the fears exhibited by the vast majority of UN ambassadors from other countries. He and the articles explained that sunlight pressure would cause the dipoles to only remain in orbit for a short period of approximately three years. The international protest ultimately resulted in a <b>consultation</b> <b>provision</b> included in the 1967 Outer Space Treaty. Fifty years later in 2013, some of the dipoles that did not deploy correctly still remain in clumps which make up a small amount of the orbital debris tracked by NASA’s Orbital Debris Program Office.|$|E

Design This was a feasibility study testing an intervention which comprised a brief conversation during routine <b>consultation,</b> <b>provision</b> of a patient leaflet and instructions to request a replacement faecal occult blood test kit. A mixed-methods approach to evaluation was adopted. Data were collected from proformas completed after each intervention, from the Bowel Screening Centre database and from questionnaires. Semi-structured interviews were carried out. We used descriptive statistics, content and framework analysis to determine intervention feasibility and acceptability. Participants Bowel screening non-responders (as defined by the Scottish Bowel Screening Centre) and primary care professionals working in five general practices in Lothian, Scotland. Primary and secondary outcome measures Several predefined feasibility parameters were assessed, including numbers of patients engaging in conversation, requesting a replacement kit and returning it, and willingness of primary care professionals to deliver the intervention. Results The intervention was offered to 258 patients in five general practices: 220 (87. 0 %) engaged with the intervention, 60 (23. 3 %) requested a new kit, 22 (8. 5 %) kits were completed and returned. Interviews and questionnaires suggest that the intervention was feasible, acceptable and consistent with an existing health prevention agenda. Reported challenges referred to work-related pressures, time constraints and practice priorities. Conclusions This intervention was acceptable and resulted in a modest increase in non-responders participating in bowel screening, although outlined challenges may affect sustained implementation.

40|$|Abstract Background The Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg {{have adopted}} laws decriminalizing {{euthanasia}} under strict conditions of prudent practice. These laws stipulate, among other things, that the attending physician should consult an independent colleague {{to judge whether}} the substantive criteria of due care have been met. In this context initiatives were taken in the Netherlands and Belgium to establish specialized services providing such consultants: Support and Consultation for Euthanasia in the Netherlands (SCEN) and Life End Information Forum (LEIF) in Belgium. The {{aim of this study}} is to describe and compare these initiatives. Methods We studied and compared relevant documents concerning the Dutch and Belgian consultation service (e. g. articles of bye-laws, inventories of activities, training books, consultation protocols). Results In both countries, the consultation services are delivered by trained physicians who can be consulted in cases of a request for euthanasia and who offer support and information to attending physicians. The context in which the two organisations were founded, as well as the way they are organised and regulated, is different in each country. By providing information on all end-of-life care matters, the Belgian LEIF seems to have a broader consultation role than the Dutch SCEN. SCEN on the other hand has a longer history, is more regulated and organised on a larger scale and receives more government funding than LEIF. The number of training hours for physicians is equal. However, SCEN-training puts more emphasis on the consultation report, whereas LEIF-training primarily emphasizes the ethical framework of end-of-life decisions. Conclusion In case of a request for euthanasia, in the Netherlands as well as in Belgium similar consultation services by independent qualified physicians have been developed. In countries where legalising physician-assisted death is being contemplated, the development of such a <b>consultation</b> <b>provision</b> could also be considered in order to safeguard the practice of euthanasia (as it can provide safeguards to adequate performance of euthanasia and assisted suicide). </p...|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] “President Barack Obama {{triggered}} a War Powers Resolution (WPR) controversy with his military {{response to the}} anti-government rebellion and civil war in Libya in 2011. Members of Congress seized upon the WPR, questioning whether the Obama administration had complied with the WPR’s requirements when the United States launched the initial Libyan Operation Odyssey Dawn (OOD) and subsequently participated in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Operation Unified Protector (OUP). Many legislators charged that President Obama had violated the WPR. Concerns centered {{on such issues as}} presidential reliance on the United Nations (U. N.) Security Council—rather than Congress—for authorization to act, the WPR’s relevance to what some perceived to be humanitarian missions, our nation’s role in a larger NATO operation, the Obama administration’s definition of “hostilities” under the WPR, and the expiration of the WPR’s sixty-day clock (requiring the termination of military involvement). As debate raged about these and other matters, the WPR’s <b>consultation</b> <b>provisions</b> failed to attract serious congressional scrutiny. Consultation, however, is at the WPR’s core and the prerequisite for the law’s stated goal that military ventures be based on the “collective judgment” of both Congress and the President. Thus, this Article concentrates on the subject of consultation and its glaring absence from the congressional conversation during the Libya crisis. After providing background on the WPR generally, the consultation requirement more specifically, and the U. S. response to the violence in Libya during the Libyan Revolution, I examine President Obama’s disregard for the consultation mandate’s letter and spirit. I then explore Congress’s muted response to the administration’s consultation violations, analyzing why the administration’s non-compliance did not spark greater congressional outrage. The congressional reaction to President Obama’s initial failure to consult on U. S. policy in Syria in August 2013, I also show, conforms to the analysis here. Finally, I consider what this study suggests {{for the future of the}} WPR’s consultation obligation. This Article hence highlights a specific WPR topic—consultation—that heretofore has received neither dedicated nor significant scholarly attention. ...|$|R

40|$|This article first {{examines}} the role reinitiated consultation plays within Congress 2 ̆ 7 s statutory framework and concludes {{that in many}} ways, reinitiated consultation is the glue that holds the Endangered Species Act 2 ̆ 7 s protective scheme together. While the ESA generally prohibits any injury to an endangered species, Congress has authorized the Service to permit such injuries under certain circumstances. But these authorizations {{must be accompanied by}} a limit that will trigger reinitiated consultation if exceeded. Thus, without reinitiated consultation, these preauthorized injuries or “takes” would prove gaping leaks in Congress 2 ̆ 7 s “Ark,” leaving little or no safety for endangered species. Moreover, reinitiated consultation has significant real world consequences for federal agencies and private parties. Failure to reinitiate consultation when legally required can subject the agency and its employees, as well as private parties, to civil and even criminal liability. Next, this article explores the legal basis for reinitiated consultation. Despite its central role, Congress never provided for reinitiated consultation within the Act itself. While the Service has acknowledged this silence, the courts generally do not raise this question of statutory authority. In light of the ambiguities within the ESA and Congress 2 ̆ 7 s clear direction in the legislative history of the Act that it intended for agencies to reinitiate consultation, this article concludes that the practice is legally supportable. Finally, given the significance of reinitiated consultation, and the likelihood that it is here to stay, this article then explores how courts have reviewed suits concerning reinitiated consultation. This discussion highlights potential challenges and best practices for federal agencies and permittees. This article concludes that, with few exceptions, courts have taken a surprisingly deferential approach to reviewing agency decisions to reinitiate, or more commonly not reinitiate, consultation. For example, courts have allowed agencies to expand a project 2 ̆ 7 s scope, duration, or impact on listed species or to recalculate how to measure the impacts altogether without requiring reinitiated consultation. Nonetheless, courts have taken a much stricter approach when considering the triggers for reinitiated consultation and have frequently insisted that those triggers be as meaningful and as exact as possible. However, before discussing reinitiated consultation in detail, this article provides some additional background on the ESA in general and reinitiated consultation in particular. To understand the purpose and effect of reinitiated consultation, one must first understand several key ESA provisions - namely, the ESA 2 ̆ 7 s listing, liability, and <b>consultation</b> <b>provisions...</b>|$|R

Occasionally, patients are reported outside Africa. Diagnosis of such imported cases can be problematic when the infection {{is due to}} Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, the chronic form of sleeping sickness found in west and central Africa. The low number of trypanosomes in the blood and the non-specific, variable symptoms make the diagnosis difficult, particularly when the index of suspicion is low.

50|$|The statute {{attempts}} to mediate a significant tension {{that exists between}} the tribes' communal interests in the respectful treatment of their deceased ancestors and related cultural items and the scientists' individual interests {{in the study of}} those same human remains and items. The act divides the treatment of American Indian human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony into two basic categories. Under the inadvertent discovery and planned excavation component of the act and regulations, if federal officials anticipate that activities on federal and tribal lands after November 16, 1990 might have an effect on American Indian burials—or if burials are discovered during such activities—they must consult with potential lineal descendants or American Indian tribal officials as part of their compliance responsibilities.

Aim – To describe the quality, {{in terms of}} provision and experience of care, of facility based family planning services for adolescents compared to older clients in Malawi. Methods- Secondary data analysis of 1388 observations of <b>consultations,</b> reflecting <b>provision</b> of care, and client exit interviews, reflecting experience of care, undertaken in the Service Provision Assessment survey 2013 - 14, a census of all formal health facilities in the country. Results- The youngest clients (age group 13 - 19) had twice the odds of reporting a better experience of care compared to clients aged 26 and older (OR 2. 03, 95 % CI 1. 15 to 3. 54, P= 0. 013). The standard of observed provision was low, typically with half {{or more of the}} mandated elements of care omitted. Compared with clients aged over 25, provision of care was slightly better for adolescents with a coefficient of 4. 56 on a percentage scale (95 % CI 0. 90 to 8. 23, P= 0. 015) and a coefficient of 2. 33 for those aged 20 - 25 (95 % CI 0. 21 to 4. 44, P= 0. 032). Clients seen in facilities under non-government organisation management had better provision of care compared to government facilities with a coefficient of 12. 35 (95 % CI 6. 70 to 18. 01, P< 0. 001); care was worse for clients seen in clinics compared to hospitals (coefficient - 6. 88, 95 % CI - 11. 41 to - 2. 35, P= 0. 003) and also for clients seen by Health Surveillance Assistants compared to those seen by a clinician (coefficient - 9. 41, 95 % CI - 15. 53 to - 3. 29, P= 0. 003). Conclusion- Quality of care for adolescents attending facility based family planning services was slightly better than for older clients but this is overshadowed by the finding of a low standard of care overall. We conclude that health system strengthening especially at clinic level is a policy and programming priority that will contribute to adolescent reproductive health in Malawi, building on successful existing models.

40|$|International audienceBackground. - Several sources {{suggest an}} {{escalation}} of scabies in ă France. ă Aim. - To describe {{a population of}} patients continuing to present with ă scabies despite multiple treatments {{in order to identify}} factors ă associated with persistence of infection. ă Patients and methods. A descriptive cross-sectional study in adults and ă children consulting for persistent scabies despite at least one previous ă treatment. A standardized questionnaire explored potential sources of ă treatment failure. ă Results. - Thirty-one patients were analyzed. Initial symptoms were ă noted to have started between two and 52 weeks earlier (mean: 19 weeks). ă The mean number of prior consultations with a general practitioner was ă 3. 1 (0 - 10) and 1. 7 with a dermatologist (0 - 7). The mean number of ă patients per household was 3. 5 (1 - 9). At least one dose of oral ă ivermectin (maximum of 6 doses per household) was prescribed for 84 % of ă patients (29 % of whom were not fasted at the time). Further, 74 % of ă patients received at least one local application of esdepallethrin and ă piperonyl butoxide (maximum: 5 courses), four received benzyl benzoate ă and two received permethrin; however, 58 % did not reapply the ă substance after hand washing. All households bought the prescribed ă treatments despite the costs. Close contacts of patients were treated in ă 58 % of households. Decontamination of bedding and clothing was carried ă out properly in 90 % of households. ă Discussion. - Persistence of infection appears to be linked to: (1) ă insufficient treatment of close contacts; (2) absence of a second ă treatment between days 7 and 14; (3) insufficient efficacy of the ă available treatments, doubtless due to multiple factors (intrinsic ă resistance of Sarcoptes, failure to repeat treatment, poor explanation ă of methods for dosing and application, and oral intake of treatments). ă Access to non-reimbursed treatments was not identified as a problem and ă decontamination of bedding and clothing was correctly performed in most ă cases. ă Conclusion. Though certain fundamental aspects of scabies treatment must ă be better known, longer <b>consultations</b> and <b>provision</b> of efficacious ă treatments are also a priority.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognised}} that organisations involved in coastal management must {{take steps to}} improve {{the ways in which}} stakeholders and the public are involved in coastal decision-making. In particular, there needs to be more emphasis on improving participation, <b>consultation,</b> and information <b>provision</b> throughout the process. In recognition of this, {{there is a need to}} develop new techniques that could aid the communication of coastal information to the public. It has been suggested that some of these techniques might involve the use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Whilst GIS are widely used by coastal managers, their application is hampered by the highly technical output that they often produce. However, the advent of a new type of system known as virtual reality GIS enables the likely effects of coastal management decisions to be presented in a format that is suitable for widespread consultation and dissemination. A proposed managed realignment scheme on the north Norfolk coast, England, is used to describe an integrated GIS methodology allowing the production of virtual reality representations of the current site environment and simulations of what might be present after the intervention. Both static and user-navigable visualisations have been produced because these lend themselves to both paper and electronic publication. Comparisons between the alternative methods are presented along with a discussion of the technical, user, and institutional issues surrounding the potential application of the methodology. It is argued that the techniques presented have the potential to stimulate meaningful discussion during the consultation process, although further research is still required to determine the exact form this might take...|$|R
40|$|Based on an {{understanding}} that a co-evolutionary systems approach relies on the conservation of the structural coupling of human beings with the biophysical world, {{with each other and}} with other species, this paper describes four practices that researchers could employ if they wished to develop a systemic, co-evolutionary praxis (theory informed practical action) : (i) rapid, multi-perspective appraisal; (ii) metaphorical inquiry (iii) social learning and (iv) systemic inquiry (an approach currently being researched as an antidote to living and operating in a projectified world). The understandings on which each of the practices is built is explored. Rapid, multi-perspective appraisal has been developed in a series of research and consultancy settings over 20 years. It is based on the assumption that when engaging with complex situations individuals only ever develop a partial appreciation (because of their traditions of understandings and the boundary judgements that are made). This practice can be used to better formulate research questions, research design, stakeholder engagement and for systemic staff induction. Metaphorical inquiry has been developed based on the understanding that human beings live in language and that all language is metaphorical. Social learning is a new paradigm for natural resources management which moves beyond information <b>provision,</b> <b>consultation</b> and stakeholder participation to address the systemic complexity associated with multiple stakeholders attempting to transform their situations. The understandings on which these practices are built have profound implications for the practices of animal scientists as we face an uncertain future under the combined influences of human induced climate change, population growth, peak oil and ecosystem collapse...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{describe}} general practitioners’ (GPs’) decision-making process for reducing nutrition risk in cardiac patients through referring a patient to a dietitian. The setting was primary care practices in Victoria. The method we employed was mixed methods research: in Study 1, 30 GPs were interviewed. Recorded interviews were transcribed and narratives analysed thematically. Study 2 involved a survey of statewide random sample of GPs. Frequencies and analyses of variance were used to explore the impact of demographic variables on decisions to refer. We found that the referral decision involved four elements: (i) synthesising management information; (ii) forecasting outcomes; (iii) planning management; and (iv) actioning referrals. GPs applied cognitive and collaborative strategies to develop a treatment plan. In Study 2, doctors (248 GPs, 30 %) concurred with identified barriers/enabling factors for patients’ referral. There was no association between GPs’ sex, age or hours worked per week and referral factors. We conclude that a GP’s judgment to offer a dietetic referral to an adult patient is a four element reasoning process. Attention to how these elements interact may assist clinical decision making. Apart from the sole use of prescribed medications/surgical procedures for cardiac care, patients offered a dietetic referral were those who were considered able to commit to dietary change and {{who were willing to}} attend a dietetic <b>consultation.</b> Improvements in <b>provision</b> of patients’ nutrition intervention information to GPs are needed. Further investigation is justified to determine how to resolve this practice gap. <br /...|$|R
