50|$|The {{psychological}} {{coping mechanisms}} are commonly termed coping strategies or coping skills. The term coping generally refers to adaptive (constructive) coping strategies. That is strategies which reduce stress. In contrast, other coping strategies may be coined as maladaptive, if they increase stress. Maladaptive coping is therefore also described, {{when looking at}} the outcome, as non-coping. Furthermore, the term coping generally refers to reactive coping, i.e. the <b>coping</b> <b>response</b> which follows the stressor. This differs from proactive coping, in which a <b>coping</b> <b>response</b> aims to neutralize a future stressor. Subconscious or non-conscious strategies (e.g. defense mechanisms) are generally excluded from the area of coping.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if there were differential approach and avoidance <b>coping</b> <b>responses</b> between Type-A and Type-B personality students when confronted with a stressful situation in the campus. Participants were Iranian undergraduate students who were divided into Type-A and Type-B groups of 75 students per group according to scores on the Type-A Behavior Inventory (TABI). The results for the ANOVA indicated a significant main effect for <b>coping</b> <b>responses,</b> a significant interaction type A/B behavior and <b>coping</b> <b>responses,</b> but the main effect for type A/B behavior not significant. A significant simple effect for Type A/B in avoidance <b>coping</b> <b>responses</b> was found.

40|$|Although {{stressful}} life change events {{are thought to}} influence the development of alcoholism and to enhance the probability of relapse after treatment, the actual <b>coping</b> <b>responses</b> to specific events among alcoholics remain largely unexplored. Efforts were made to operatinnalize and classify <b>coping</b> <b>responses</b> and to explore their relationship to treatment outcome in a comparison of recovered alcoholics (N= 42), relapsed alcoholics (N= 57) and matched community controls (N= 89). Comparisons of coping were lade after controlling for demographic characteristics, incidence of negative life change events in the past year, the stresses being coped with, and prior levels of functioning (alcohol consumption, emotional and psychosomatic distress). There were no differences between recovered alcoholics and control subjects. Relapsed alcoholics reported using more avoidance and emotion-focused <b>coping</b> <b>responses.</b> The <b>coping</b> <b>responses</b> were also predictive of posttreatment functioning after controlling for the research variables.

50|$|Another {{specific}} {{technique that}} can be used is the utilization of music as a “memory time machine” of sorts. In this regard, music can allow one to escape to pleasant or unpleasant memories and trigger a <b>coping</b> <b>response.</b> It has been suggested that music can be closely tied to re-experiencing the psychological aspects of past memories, so selecting music with positive connotations is one possible way that music can reduce stress.|$|E
50|$|Response {{efficacy}} concerns {{beliefs that}} adopting a particular behavioral response {{will be effective}} in reducing the diseases' threat, and self-efficacy {{is the belief that}} one can successfully perform the <b>coping</b> <b>response.</b> In line with the traditional way of measuring the consequences of behavior, response efficacy was operationalized by linking consequences to the recommended behavior as well as to whether the subject regarded the consequences as likely outcomes of the recommended behavior. Among the 6 factors (vulnerability, severity, rewards, response efficacy, self-efficacy, and response costs), self-efficacy is the most correlated with protection motivation, according to meta-analysis studies.|$|E
50|$|A more {{theoretical}} {{critique of}} this coping strategy {{is that the}} use of music in stress coping is largely a short-term <b>coping</b> <b>response</b> and therefore lacks long-term sustainability. These critics argue that while music may be effective in lowering perceived stress levels of patients, it is not necessarily making a difference on the actual cause of the stress response. Because the root cause of the stress is not affected, {{it is possible that the}} stress response may return shortly after therapy is ended. Those who hold this position advocate instead for a more problem-focused coping strategy that directly deals with the stressors affecting the patient.|$|E

50|$|The {{two common}} {{responses}} to one's unjust behavior are forgiveness and revenge. When one perceives {{he has been}} the victim of unjust behavior, he will evaluate the situation and select the appropriate <b>coping</b> <b>response</b> for the negative experience. If the victim views the situation with anger and resentment, he chooses revenge as the next necessary step. On the opposite side, if the victim is able {{to let go of the}} negative emotions attached to the circumstances, he will choose forgiveness. Individuals are more likely to forgive a transgressor if they avoid holding the transgressor accountable for the offense and if the transgressor is apologetic.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a wealth}} of anecdotal {{evidence}} demonstrating the effectiveness that music can have as a <b>coping</b> <b>response</b> in this regard. For example, if a patient of either PTSD or dementia were to have a loved one die, {{he or she might}} associate a certain song with the person being mourned for, and hearing that song could bring about feelings of happiness or deep sadness. In addition, if there was a certain connection between them, such as in marriage, and their wedding song came on, an overly powerful emotional reaction could occur. These overly emotional situations trigger memories and a stress response that anguishes the person remembering these hurtful memories. A certain song that pertains to that memory can trigger nearly any emotion.|$|E
50|$|Dissociation is a {{psychological}} process involving alterations in personal identity or sense of self. These alterations can include: {{a sense that}} one's self or the world is unreal (derealization and depersonalization); a loss of memory (amnesia); forgetting one's identity or assuming a new self (fugue); and fragmentation of identity or self into separate streams of consciousness (dissociative identity disorder, formerly termed multiple personality disorder). Dissociation is measured most often by the Dissociative Experiences Scale. Several studies have reported that dissociation and fantasy proneness are highly correlated. This suggests {{the possibility that the}} dissociated selves are merely fantasies, for example, being a <b>coping</b> <b>response</b> to trauma. However, a lengthy review of the evidence concludes that there is strong empirical support for the hypothesis that dissociation is caused primarily and directly by exposure to trauma, and that fantasy is of secondary importance.|$|E

Various elements of <b>coping</b> <b>responses</b> to ER stress including Perk, Ask 1, Bip, Chop, Gadd 34, Ire 1, Atf 4, Atf 6, and Xbp 1 have been identified and were found to be inducible in oocytes and preimplantation embryos, suggesting that, as a normal part of the cellular adaptive mechanism, these <b>coping</b> <b>responses,</b> including the UPR, play a pivotal {{role in the development of}} preimplantation embryos.

5000|$|Another {{behavioral}} activation approach utilized {{a different}} methodology: clients {{are asked to}} {{develop an understanding of}} relationship between actions and emotions, with actions being seen as the cause of emotions. An hourly self-monitoring chart is created to track activities and the impact on the mood they create for a full week. A rating scale from 1 to 10 is used for each mood change per hour. The goal is to identify depression loops. A depression loop is when a temporary coping method increases the overall depression, such as the temporary relief provided by alcohol or other drugs, escape or avoidance or rumination. When patterns of dysfunctional responding, or loops, are identified alternative coping responses are attempted to break the loop. This method is described with the acronym [...] "TRAP" [...] (Trigger, Response, Avoidance Pattern [...] ) which is to be replaced with a [...] "TRAC" [...] (Trigger, Response, Alternate <b>Coping</b> <b>response).</b> Particular attention is given to rumination, which is provided with its own acronym RCA (Rumination Cues Action). Rumination is identified as a particularly common avoidance behavior which worsens mood. The client is to evaluate the rumination in terms of it having improved the thing being ruminated about, providing understanding, and its emotional effects on the client. Attending to experience is suggested as an alternative to rumination as well as other possible distracting or mood improving actions.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: {{the purpose}} of this study was to analyse the impact of <b>coping</b> <b>response</b> on {{survival}} of breast cancer by using a new method of assessing coping. Method: adjustment to cancer was assessed using a revised measure in a large cohort of breast cancer patients (N?=? 578) followed up over a period of 10 ?years. Impact of <b>coping</b> <b>response</b> measured early in the disease process (< 4 ?months from primary diagnosis of early-stage breast cancer) was assessed, and survival analyses were undertaken including known clinical staging data and cancer treatment details. Results: after 5 ?years of follow-up from primary diagnosis, the effect of prior ‘negative adjustment’ was statistically significantly linked to increased risk of death and relapse of breast cancer, and for the 10 -year analysis, this result remained for both risk of death and relapse. There was no statistically significant effect on survival of the novel ‘positive adjustment’ response. Conclusions: coping with cancer was assessed using a new methodology and is linked to an adverse impact of negative adjustment on overall survival. Positive adjustment was unrelated to survival. The current study strengthens previous evidence that there is a link between survival and <b>coping</b> <b>response.</b> The question remains of how <b>coping</b> <b>response</b> might affect physical outcome.

40|$|The {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) supports many cellular processes and performs diverse functions, including protein synthesis, translocation across the membrane, {{integration into the}} membrane, folding, and posttranslational modifications including N-linked glycosylation; and regulation of Ca 2 + homeostasis.

This study also explored how children 2 ̆ 7 s emotional experience and coping behaviors were related to gender, peer socialization (i. e., receiving prosocial acts by peers and previous victimization experiences), and indices of psychopathology. Children ages 7 - 12 (N= 53) completed questionnaires to assess emotional and <b>coping</b> <b>responses</b> to hypothetical peer rejection scenarios, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and peer experiences. Overall, findings suggested that emotion-related factors (emotion states and more stable 2 ̆ 2 emotional tendencies 2 ̆ 2 such as psychological symptoms) and social context (i. e., children 2 ̆ 7 s prosocial peer experiences and victimization) are important predictors of children 2 ̆ 7 s coping with peer rejection.

In addition, we examined parents’ reports of their children’s temperamental traits as correlates of coping. In random order followed by a positive stimulus, children (N = 206, age 8 – 12 years) watched each of the three stressful events, and reported their emotions, perceived control, orientation and coping after each one. As anticipated, results indicated that controllability was associated with more challenge coping (a composite of adaptive/approach <b>coping</b> <b>responses</b> such as problem solving and support seeking) and less threat coping (a composite of maladaptive/withdrawal <b>coping</b> <b>responses</b> such as helplessness and escape). In general, feelings of sadness were more strongly associated with challenge coping, whereas fear and anger especially related to more threat coping. Greater orientation towards the stressor was particularly predictive of more challenge coping, but also was associated with more threat <b>coping</b> in <b>response</b> to parent stressors.

In particular, although dyadic coping is a key factor in relationships, questions regarding the role of perceptions in the dyadic coping process remain unanswered: Are people’s perceptions of the partner’s dyadic <b>coping</b> <b>responses</b> related to what their partner actually reports to do?

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study was to use couple-level data to examine {{negative}} emotions and social information-processing (SIP) abilities as risk factors for intimate partner violence (IPV) among 100 dating couples (N = 200; mean age = 21. 45 years). Crick and Dodge 2 ̆ 7 s (1994) SIP model was used as a guiding theoretical framework. Participants read a series of hypothetical conflict situation vignettes and responded to questionnaires to assess negative emotions and various facets of SIP including attributions for partner behaviour, generation of response alternatives, and response selection. The Revised Conflict Tactic Scales (CTS 2; Straus, Hamby, Boney-McCoy, 2 ̆ 6 Sugarman, 1996) were used to assess how often acts of physical aggression occurred in the preceding year. Bivariate correlations revealed negative emotions and SIP abilities were significantly intercorrelated. A series of negative binomial mixed-model regressions were conducted based on the actor-partner interdependence model (APIM; Kenny, Kashy, 2 ̆ 6 Cook, 2006). Significant results emerged for the response generation and negative emotion models. Results suggested that participants who generated a lower number of <b>coping</b> <b>response</b> alternatives were at greater risk of victimization (actor effect). Women were at greater risk of victimization if they had partners who generated a lower number of <b>coping</b> <b>response</b> alternatives (sex by partner interaction effect). Generation of less competent <b>coping</b> <b>response</b> alternatives predicted greater risk of perpetration among men, whereas generation of more competent <b>coping</b> <b>response</b> alternatives predicted greater risk of victimization among women (sex by actor interaction effects). Finally, two significant actor by partner interaction effects emerged for the negative emotion models. Participants who reported similar levels of negative emotions as their partners were at lowest risk of perpetration, whereas participants who reported discrepant levels of negative emotions from their partners were at greatest risk of perpetration. Participants who reported low levels of negative emotions were at lowest risk of victimization regardless of their partner 2 ̆ 7 s emotions; however, participants who reported high levels of negative emotions were at greatest risk of victimization if they had partners who reported low levels of negative emotions.

Children’s emotions predicted <b>coping</b> <b>responses</b> after controlling for peer experiences. Specifically, anger was associated with aggressive coping, whereas sadness was associated with ruminative coping, supporting theory that emotions have distinct motivational-behavioral properties. Peer experiences were also important, as victimization was associated with aggressive coping, and receipt of prosocial peer behaviors was associated with positive reappraisal. These findings provide an empirical foundation for future research {{and the development of}} interventions to facilitate adaptive reactions to peer rejection...|$|R
