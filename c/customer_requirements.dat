Various reasons are put forward for this, such as the failure of some establishments {{to keep up with}} <b>customer</b> <b>requirements.</b> Others claim the smoking ban of 2007, intense competition from gastro-pubs, the availability of cheap alcohol in supermarkets or the general economic climate are either to blame, or are factors in the decline.

25|$|Operations {{management}} {{is an area}} of management concerned with designing and controlling the process of production and redesigning business operations in the production of goods or services. It involves the responsibility of ensuring that business operations are efficient in terms of using as few resources as needed and effective in terms of meeting <b>customer</b> <b>requirements.</b> It is concerned with managing an entire production system which is the process that converts inputs (in the forms of raw materials, labor, and energy) into outputs (in the form of goods and/or services), as an asset or delivers a product or services. Operations produce products, manage quality and creates service. Operation management covers sectors like banking systems, hospitals, companies, working with suppliers, customers, and using technology. Operations {{is one of the major}} functions in an organization along with supply chains, marketing, finance and human resources. The operations function requires management of both the strategic and day-to-day production of goods and services.|$|E

The Gripen is typically customized to <b>customer</b> <b>requirements,</b> enabling the routine inclusion of local suppliers in the manufacturing and support processes. A number of South African firms provide components and systems – including the communications suite and electronic warfare systems – for the Gripens operated by South African Air Force. Operators also {{have access to the}} Gripen's source code and technical documentation, allowing for upgrades and new equipment to be independently integrated. [...] Some export customers intend to domestically assemble the Gripen; it has been proposed that Brazilian aerospace manufacturer Embraer may produce Gripens for other export customers as well.|$|E

40|$|Traditional {{methods used}} for the {{classification}} of <b>customer</b> <b>requirement</b> information are typically based on specific indicators, hierarchical structures, and data formats and involve a qualitative analysis in terms of stationary patterns. Because these methods neither consider the scalability of classification results nor do they regard subsequent application to product configuration, their classification becomes an isolated operation. However, the transformation of <b>customer</b> <b>requirement</b> information into quantifiable values {{would lead to a}} dynamic classification according to specific conditions and would enable an association with product configuration in an enterprise. This paper introduces a classification analysis based on quantitative standardization, which focuses on (i) expressing <b>customer</b> <b>requirement</b> information mathematically and (ii) classifying <b>customer</b> <b>requirement</b> information for product configuration purposes. Our classification analysis treated <b>customer</b> <b>requirement</b> information as follows: first, it was transformed into standardized values using mathematics, subsequent to which it was classified through calculating the dissimilarity with general <b>customer</b> <b>requirement</b> information related to the product family. Finally, a case study was used to demonstrate and validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the classification analysis...|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{acquisition}} and effective translation of <b>customer</b> <b>requirement</b> s are two key links in product configuration design. In the paper, two concepts are introduced for <b>customer</b> <b>requirement</b> decomposition. One is the requirement element, {{and the other}} is the granularity of requirement element. Moreover, the controlling principle for granularity of requirement element is given and the method of requirement decomposition is proposed from the point of semantic meaning. This method means semantic segmentation, semantic translation, supplement or subdivision of human-machine-environment and semantic combination. <b>Customer’s</b> customized <b>requirements</b> could be decomposed effectively according to the proposed method of requirement decomposition as well as by controlling the granularity of requirement element reasonably. On that basis, in <b>customer</b> <b>requirement</b> translation, improved house of quality (IHoQ) is constructed by combining the characteristics of requirement element and the demands of configuration design and using the thought of quality function development (QFD). So, a new approach of <b>customer</b> <b>requirement</b> analysis based on requirement element and IHoQ is put forward by integrating organically the technology of requirement decomposition and the tool of requirement translation. Accurate {{acquisition and}} effective translation for <b>customer</b> <b>requirement</b> s could be realized by using this approach. Finally, the customized design of a money-binding machine is taken as an example to validate the effectivity of proposed method. </p...|$|R
