5000|$|In {{a single}} crystal sample, the {{macroscopic}} yield stress {{will be determined}} by the Schmid factor of the single grain. Thus, in general, different yield strengths will be observed for applied stresses along different crystallographic directions. In polycrystalline specimens, the yield strength of each grain is different depending on its maximum Schmid factor, which indicates the operational slip system(s). The macroscopically observed yield stress will be related to the material's CRSS by an average Schmid factor, which is roughly 1/3.06 for FCC and 1/2.75 for body-centered cubic (BCC) structures.The onset of plasticity in polycrystals is influenced by the number of available slip systems to accommodate incompatibilities at the grain boundaries. In the case of two adjacent, randomly oriented grains, one grain will have a larger Schmid factor and thus a smaller yield stress. Under load, this [...] "weaker" [...] grain will yield prior to the [...] "stronger" [...] grain, and as it deforms a stress concentration will build up in the stronger grain near the boundary between them. This stress concentration will activate dislocation motion in the available glide planes. These dislocations are geometrically necessary to ensure that the strain in each grain is equivalent at the grain boundary, so that the <b>compatibility</b> <b>criteria</b> are satisfied. G. I. Taylor showed that a minimum of five active slip systems are required to accommodate an arbitrary deformation. In crystal structures with fewer than 5 active slip systems, such as hexagonal close-packed (HCP) metals, the specimen will exhibit brittle failure instead of plastic deformation.|$|E

This conclusion is drawn {{on the basis of the}} finding that the M-R relation gives the necessary and sufficient condition for dynamical stability of equilibrium configurations only when the <b>compatibility</b> <b>criterion</b> for these configurations is appropriately satisfied. In this regard, we construct an appropriate sequence composed of core-envelope models on the basis of <b>compatibility</b> <b>criterion,</b> such that each member of this sequence satisfies the extreme case of causality condition v = c = 1 at the centre. The maximum stable value of u ≃ 0. 3389 (which occurs for the model corresponding to the maximum value of mass in the mass-radius relation) and the corresponding central value of the local adiabatic index, (Γ_ 1) _ 0 ≃ 2. 5911, of this model are found fully consistent with those of the corresponding absolute values, u_ max≤ 0. 3406, and (Γ_ 1) _ 0 ≤ 2. 5946, which impose strong constraints on these parameters of such models. In addition to this example, we also study dynamical stability of pure adiabatic polytropic configurations on the basis of variational method for the choice of the `trial function', ξ =re^ν/ 4, as well as the mass-central density relation, since the <b>compatibility</b> <b>criterion</b> is appropriately satisfied for these models.

40|$|An {{extension}} of the conditional expectations (those under a given subalgebra of events and not the simple ones under a single event) from the classical to the quantum case is presented. In the classical case, the conditional expectations always exist; in the quantum case, however, they exist only if a certain weak <b>compatibility</b> <b>criterion</b> is satisfied. This <b>compatibility</b> <b>criterion</b> was introduced among others in a recent paper by the author. Then, state-independent conditional expectations and quantum Markov processes are studied. A classical Markov process is a probability measure, together with a system of random variables, satisfying the Markov property and can equivalently be described by a system of Markovian kernels (often forming a semigroup). This equivalence is partly extended to quantum probabilities. It is shown that a dynamical (semi) group {{can be derived from}} a given system of quantum observables satisfying the Markov property, and the group generators are studied. The results are presented in the framework of Jordan operator algebras, and a very general type of observables (including the usual real-valued observables or self-adjoint operators) is considered.
