40|$|The {{types of}} nonequilibrium {{emission}} and absorption by interstellar molecules are summarized. The observed brightness emission temperatures of compact OH and H 2 O sources are discussed using {{the concept of}} maser amplification. A single thermodynamic approach was used in which masers and anti-masers are considered as heat engines for the theoretical interpretation of the <b>cosmic</b> <b>maser</b> and anti-maser phenomena.

40|$|International audienceVLBI is not {{currently}} supported {{in the present}} ALMA construction plan. How- ever, the ALMA high gain antennas are equipped with receivers spanning several fre- quency ranges of interest to perform future mil- limetre (mm) /submillimetre (submm) VLBI ob- servations. The phased outputs of the full ALMA array or of subsets of the ALMA an- tennas will be supported in the future. In the mm/submm domain where spatial resolution is high but sensitivity is low in general, addition of the large ALMA collecting area to existing or fu- ture VLBI arrays would provide a definite detec- tion or mapping advantage. Fine details of com- pact components in bright AGNs and highly red- shifted sources could be revealed with good sen- sitivity −even though the brightest sources could remain unresolved with the longest terrestrial baselines. We briefly comment on the impor- tance of relatively short VLBI baselines (in the 100 – 1000 km range) to: (i) map the mm/submm <b>cosmic</b> <b>maser</b> sources excited in evolved stars or galactic star-forming regions; (ii) perform high precision astrometry of nearby stars.

40|$|The Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) {{has been}} used to make the first full {{polarization}} observations of 6. 7 GHz methanol masers. Linear polarization was detected towards all four sources observed, at levels between a few and 10 %, while none of the sources show circular polarization stronger than approximately 1. 5 %. Linear polarization appears to be more common in the 6. 7 GHz methanol maser transition than it is for the 12. 2 GHz transition, consistent with the hypothesis that the 6. 7 GHz masers are more saturated.

40|$|Bipolar {{molecular}} outflows {{have been}} observed and studied extensively in the past, but some recent observations of periodic variations in maser intensity pose new challenges. Even quasi-periodic maser flares {{have been observed}} and reported in the literature. Motivated by these data, {{we have tried to}} study situations in binary systems with specific attention to the two observed features, i. e., the bipolar flows and the variabilities in the maser intensity. We have studied the evolution of spherically symmetric wind from one of the bodies in the binary system, in the plane of the binary. Our approach includes the analytical study of rotating flows with numerical computation of streamlines of fluid particles using PLUTO code. We present the results of our findings assuming simple configurations, and discuss the implications.

40|$|A flare of maser radio {{emission}} in the OH-line 1665 MHz {{has been discovered}} in the star forming region W 75 N in 2003, with the flux density of about 1000 Jy. At {{the time it was}} the strongest OH maser detected during the whole history of observations since the discovery of <b>cosmic</b> <b>masers</b> in 1965. The flare emission is linearly polarized with a degree of polarization near 100 %. A weaker flare with a flux of 145 Jy was observed in this source in 2000 - 2001, which was probably a precursor of the powerful flare. Intensity of two other spectral features has decreased after beginning of the flare. Such variation of the intensity of maser condensation emission (increasing of one and decreasing of the other) can be explained by passing of the magneto hydrodynamic shock across regions of enhanced gas concentration.

40|$|We {{performed}} the first VLBI {{observations of the}} SiO v= 1 and v= 2 J= 1 [...] 0 masers in a Proto Planetary Nebula OH 231. 8 + 4. 2 (also known as the Rotten Egg nebula), at milliarcsecond resolution. Only the v= 2 maser transition was detected. We detect several maser spots lying along a line which is almost perpendicular to the axis of symmetry of the Nebula. We find that all the emission is concentrated {{in an area of}} ~ 10 mas, indicating that the SiO masers are originated very close {{to the surface of the}} star. One of the two emission areas presents an elongated structure with a clear velocity gradient. The detected emission is consistent with a torus, or disk, in rotation with a velocity of ~ 6 km/s and with an infall velocity of ~ 10 km/s.

40|$|The {{specific}} astrophysical {{data collected}} {{during the last decade}} causes the need for the modification of the expression for the Einstein-Hilbert action, and several attempts sufficing this need are known. The modification suggested in this paper stems from the possible anisotropy of space-time and this means the natural change of the simplest scalar in the least action principle. To provide the testable support to this idea, the optic-metrical parametric resonance is regarded - an experiment on the galactic scale based on the interaction between the electromagnetic radiation of <b>cosmic</b> <b>masers</b> and periodical gravitational waves emitted by close double systems or pulsars. Since the effect depends on the space-time metric, the possible anisotropy could reveal itself through observations. To give the corresponding theory predicting the corrections to the expected results of the experiment, the specific mathematical formalism of Finsler geometry was chosen. It was found that in case the anisotropy of the space-time exists, the orientation of the astrophysical systems suitable for observations would show it. In the obtained geodesics equation there is a direction dependent term. Comment: 17 page...|$|R
40|$|We review {{properties}} of all known collisionally pumped (class I) methanol maser series based on observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) and the Mopra radio telescope. Masers at 36, 84, 44 and 95 GHz are most widespread, while 9. 9, 25, 23. 4 and 104 GHz masers are much rarer, tracing the most energetic shocks. A survey of many southern masers at 36 and 44 GHz {{suggests that these}} two transitions are highly complementary. The 23. 4 GHz maser is {{a new type of}} rare class I methanol maser, detected only in two high-mass star-forming regions, G 357. 97 - 0. 16 and G 343. 12 - 0. 06, and showing a behaviour similar to 9. 9, 25 and 104 GHz masers. Interferometric positions suggest that shocks responsible for class I masers could arise from a range of phenomena, not merely an outflow scenario. For example, some masers might be caused by interaction of an expanding HII region with its surrounding molecular cloud. This has implications for evolutionary sequences incorporating class I methanol masers if they appear more than once during the evolution of the star-forming region. We also make predictions for candidate maser transitions at the ALMA frequency range.

40|$|The microturbulent {{approximation}} of turbulent motions {{is widely used}} in radiative transfer calculations. Mainly motivated by its simple computational application it is probably in many cases an oversimplified treatment of the dynamical processes involved. This aspect is in particular important {{in the analysis of}} maser lines, since the strong amplification of radiation leads to a sensitive dependence of the radiation field on the overall velocity structure. To demonstrate the influence of large scale motions on the formation of maser lines we present a simple stochastic model which takes velocity correlations into account. For a quantitative analysis of correlation effects, we generate in a Monte Carlo simulation individual realizations of a turbulent velocity field along a line of sight. Depending {{on the size of the}} velocity correlation length we find huge deviations between the resulting random profiles in respect of line shape, intensity and position of single spectral components. Finally, we simulate the emission of extended maser sources. A qualitative comparison with observed masers associated with star forming regions shows that our model can reproduce the observed general spectral characteristics. We also investigate shortly, how the spectra are effected when a systematic velocity field (simulating expansion) is superposed on the fluctuations. Our results convincingly demonstrate that hydrodynamical motions are of great importance for the understanding of <b>cosmic</b> <b>masers.</b> Comment: Accepted for publication in A&A. 8 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

40|$|OH(1720 MHz) masers are {{excellent}} signposts {{of interaction between}} supernova remnants(SNRs) and molecular clouds. Using the GBT and VLA we have surveyed 75 SNRs and 6 candidates for maser emission. Four new interacting SNRs are detected with OH masers: G 5. 4 - 1. 2, G 5. 7 - 0. 0, G 8. 7 - 0. 1 and G 9. 7 - 0. 0. The newly detected interacting SNRs G 5. 7 - 0. 0 and G 8. 7 - 0. 1 have TeV γ-ray counterparts which may indicate a local cosmic ray enhancement. It has been noted that maser-emitting SNRs are preferentially distributed in the Molecular Ring and Nuclear Disk. We use the present and existing surveys to demonstrate that masers are strongly confined to within |l | ≤ 50 ◦ {{at a rate of}} 15 % of the total SNR population. All new detections are within 10 ◦ Galactic longitude emphasizing this trend. Additionally, a substantial number of SNR masers have peak fluxes at or below the detection threshold of existing surveys. This calls into question whether maser surveys of Galactic SNRs can be considered complete and how many maser-emitting remnants remain to be detected in the Galaxy.
