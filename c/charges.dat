This paper presents an optimal <b>charging</b> strategy for Li-ion batteries {{based on the}} voltage-based multistage constant current (VMCC) <b>charging</b> strategy. In order to satisfy the different <b>charging</b> demands of the EV users for <b>charging</b> time, <b>charged</b> capacity and energy loss, the multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm is employed and the influences of <b>charging</b> stage number, <b>charging</b> cut-off voltage and weight factors of different <b>charging</b> goals are analyzed. Comparison experiments of the proposed <b>charging</b> strategy and the traditional normal and fast <b>charging</b> strategies are carried out. The experimental results demonstrate that the traditional normal and fast <b>charging</b> strategies can only satisfy a small range of EV users’ <b>charging</b> demand well while the proposed <b>charging</b> strategy can satisfy {{the whole range of}} the <b>charging</b> demand well. The relative increase in <b>charging</b> performance of the proposed <b>charging</b> strategy can reach more than 80 % when compared to the normal and fast <b>charging</b> dependently...|$|R

30|$|Currently, two PEV <b>charging</b> modes {{are widely}} adopted: normal <b>charging</b> mode {{at home or}} parking lots with lower <b>charging</b> power level, and fast <b>charging</b> mode at fast <b>charging</b> {{stations}} with higher <b>charging</b> power level, the typical <b>charging</b> duration is 20 – 30  min [18]. Besides the <b>charging</b> power level, the characteristics of such two <b>charging</b> modes are also intrinsically different. When a PEV is driving to the destination but the SoC is too low to complete the rest trip, it should find a fast <b>charging</b> station to get <b>charged</b> with the fast <b>charging</b> mode as soon as possible. However, the normal <b>charging</b> often happens when a PEV arrives at home or workplaces and it doesn’t hurry to get fully <b>charged</b> [19, 20].|$|R
40|$|ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2017. As {{the number}} of Electric Vehicle (EV) increases, the uncoordinated <b>charging</b> {{behaviors}} may cause the <b>charging</b> demand fluctuations and the <b>charging</b> load unbalanced. Besides, the users’ <b>charging</b> behaviors are affected by many factors. For example, the residual energy of battery decides the travel distance of EV and if an EV has more residual energy, the <b>charging</b> willing is lower. Because EV users don’t have much willing to change their <b>charging</b> time and place {{just as in the}} past, the <b>charging</b> habit may also affect the <b>charging</b> decision. In this paper, we propose a smart <b>charging</b> startegy CDF (<b>Charging</b> Decision Function), where three sub-functions related to the residual energy of battery, EV’s <b>charging</b> habit, and the <b>charging</b> efficiency of <b>charging</b> station are all weighted and involved, for improving the balance of <b>charging</b> load and reducing the <b>charging</b> demand fluctuations. The <b>charging</b> decision is resulted from the CDF’s value, and if an EV decides to <b>charge,</b> the <b>charging</b> time as well as <b>charging</b> place is also calculated. Compared with other two related strategies, CDF has the best performance in terms of reducing the <b>charging</b> demand fluctuations.
