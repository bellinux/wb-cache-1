5|$|It is a {{large black}} vulture with a ruff of white {{feathers}} surrounding {{the base of the}} neck and, especially in the male, large white patches on the wings. The head and neck are nearly featherless, and are a dull red color, which may flush and therefore change color in response to the bird's emotional state. In the male, there is a wattle on the neck and a large, dark red comb or <b>caruncle</b> on the crown of the head. Unlike most birds of prey, the male is larger than the female.|$|E
5|$|Large and {{predominantly}} white, {{the king}} vulture has gray to black ruff, flight, and tail feathers. The {{head and neck}} are bald, with the skin color varying, including yellow, orange, blue, purple, and red. The king vulture has a very noticeable orange fleshy <b>caruncle</b> on its beak. This vulture is a scavenger and it often makes the initial cut into a fresh carcass. It also displaces smaller New World vulture species from a carcass. King vultures {{have been known to}} live for up to 30 years in captivity.|$|E
5|$|The adult plumage is {{a uniform}} black, with the {{exception}} of a frill of white feathers nearly surrounding the base of the neck and, especially in the male, large patches or bands of white on the wings which do not appear until the completion of the bird's first moulting. The head and neck are red to blackish-red and have few feathers. The head and neck are meticulously kept clean by the bird, and their baldness is an adaptation for hygiene, allowing the skin to be exposed to the sterilizing effects of dehydration and ultraviolet light at high altitudes. The crown of the head is flattened. In the male, the head is crowned with a dark red <b>caruncle</b> or comb, while the skin of his neck lies in folds, forming a wattle. The skin of the head and neck is capable of flushing noticeably in response to emotional state, which serves to communicate between individuals. Juveniles have a grayish-brown general coloration, blackish head and neck skin, and a brown ruff.|$|E
50|$|<b>Caruncles</b> {{are also}} {{ornamental}} elements used by males to attract females to breeding. Having large <b>caruncles</b> or colorful bright ones indicates {{high levels of}} testosterone, that they are well-fed birds able to elude other predators thus showing the good quality of their genes. It has been proposed that these organs are also associated with genes which encode resistance to disease. It is believed that for birds living in tropical regions, the <b>caruncles</b> {{also play a role}} in thermoregulation, making the blood cool faster when flowing through them.|$|R

In stark contrast, the wing coverts, flight feathers and tail are dark grey to black, as is the prominent thick neck ruff. The head and neck are devoid of feathers, the skin shades of red and purple on the head, vivid orange on the neck and yellow on the throat. On the head, the skin is wrinkled and folded, and there is a highly noticeable irregular golden crest attached on the cere above its orange and black bill; this <b>caruncle</b> does not fully form until the bird’s fourth year.|$|E

60|$|Discontinuous generic Areas.--It is {{not very}} easy to find good {{examples}} of genera whose species occupy two or more quite disconnected areas, for though such cases may not be rare, we are seldom {{in a position to}} mark out the limits of the several species with sufficient accuracy. The best and most remarkable case among European birds is {24} that of the blue magpies, forming the genus Cyanopica. One species (C. cooki) is confined (as already stated) to the wooded and mountainous districts of Spain and Portugal, while the only other species of the genus (C. cyanus) is found far away in North-eastern Asia and Japan, so that the two species are separated by about 5,000 miles of continuous land. Another case is that of the curious little water-moles forming the genus Mygale, one species M. muscovitica, being found only {{on the banks of the}} Volga and Don in South-eastern Russia, while the other, M. pyrenaica, is confined to streams on the northern side of the Pyrenees. In tropical America there are four different kinds of bell-birds belonging to the genus Chasmorhynchus, each of which appears to inhabit a restricted area completely separated from the others. The most northerly is C. tricarunculatus of Costa Rica and Veragua, a brown bird with a white head and three long caruncles growing upwards at the base of the beak. Next comes C. variegatus, in Venezuela, a white bird with a brown head and numerous caruncles on the throat, perhaps conterminous with the last; in Guiana, extending to near the mouth of the Rio Negro, we have C. niveus, the bell-bird described by Waterton, which is pure white, with a single long fleshy <b>caruncle</b> at the base of the beak; the last species, C. nudicollis, inhabits South-east Brazil, and is also white, but with black stripes over the eyes, and with a naked throat. These birds are about the size of thrushes, and are all remarkable for their loud, ringing notes, like a bell or a blow on an anvil, as well as for their peculiar colours. They are therefore known to the native Indians wherever they exist, and we may be the more sure that they do not spread over the intervening areas where they have never been found, and where the natives know nothing of them.|$|E

50|$|The Kerguelen shag is 65 cm {{long with}} a {{wingspan}} of 110 cm, {{making it the}} smallest blue-eyed shag. The adult's upperparts, tail, and thighs are metallic greenish black; the underbody to the throat is white; and the wing linings are brown.

The face and throat pouch are dark brown, ornamented with yellow-orange tubercles. The bill is horn-colored or brown; the eyes are hazel. The legs and feet vary from dark brown to dark-blotched bright pink. Breeding adults have a little black erectile crest on the forehead, yellow or orange <b>caruncles</b> (large warts) above the base of the bill, and a bright blue ring around the eye.

40|$|Intercaruncular glandular regions {{were found}} among the uterine <b>caruncles</b> in {{ruminant}} pregnant uteruses.

Therefore, our objective was to characterize these intercaruncular regions of the pregnant uterus of zebu and buffalo cows. Small portions of the same regions of zebu (n= 57) and water buffalo cows (n= 30) were fixed in 10 % formaldehyde and 4 % paraformoldehyde in PBS, processed and stained for light microscopy in order to characterize the morphology, and histochemistry (Perl’s, PAS and acid phosphatase reactions) to confirm iron transfer. The intercaruncular region was located among the uterine <b>caruncles</b> and was composed by an endometrium, a myometrium, and a richly vascularized perimetrium. The endometrial glands were made up of a simple columnar epithelium and they were reactive to ferric iron (Perl's reaction), acid phosphatase and PAS. Collectively, the present results support the hypothesis that endometrial glands are important sites of secretion and substance transfer from the dam and that they are implicated in the nourishment of the ruminant fetus...|$|R
