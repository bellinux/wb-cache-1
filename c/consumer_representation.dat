40|$|This {{study is}} part of a {{research}} programme devoted to improving the quality of organic bread. It aims to identify and test prototypes of breads approved by consumers. This is achieved by analysing <b>consumer</b> <b>representations</b> and preferences and placing them within the framework of technological, sensory and nutritional dimensions of the products. The multidisciplinary approach implements an original qualitative approach that combines three consumer focus groups made up of both loyal and occasional consumers, and confrontation sessions with the programme scientific partners. Four prototypes of organic breads have thus been formalised and subsequently tested on a sample of 120 consumers from two sites (Angers and Strasbourg). From an operational point of view, proposals for organic breads approved by consumers are formulated. In terms of methodology, the contributions of a multidisciplinary study are discussed...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} explores <b>consumer</b> <b>representations</b> of nature, motives {{to associate}} with nature and its implications on ecological worldviews and responsible consumption attitudes and behaviour. This study addresses the lack of theoretical explanation in the literature relating to motivation and the self-nature relationship, specifically on how, why and in what form consumers seek and maintain {{their relationship with the}} natural world. The aim is to build theory to explain how the self-nature relationship affects responsible consumption attitudes and behaviour. The research consists of two studies: Study One used data from an international environmental blog to explore how people create sense of self in relation to nature. Study Two explored how self-nature relationships affect responsible consumption behaviour. Data for the second study was collected using ethnography which was based on Malaysian consumers. Purposive sampling ensured data richness; that is, only participants who engaged with nature and expressed a concern for its preservation were selected. Overall the results show consumers construct personal meanings of nature through socialisation. Through the process of socialisation, the consumer comes to perceive nature as part of the self (relational extended-self, encapsulated self and sense of oneness), which positively influences ecological worldview and encourages responsible consumption attitudes and behaviour. While the theory of extended self has been applied to understand relationship with tangible possessions, there is limited application on intangible objects, such as nature. The developed conceptual frameworks offer theoretical advances on alternative ways to conceptualise the self-nature relationship. Nature perceived as external, as part or within self has implication for theory. Additionally, this research elaborates on the roles of emotional, spiritual and religious attachment to improve the understanding of the formation of ecological worldviews and identifies transcentric worldview as an additional ideology. This research provides in-depth insights into how consumers relate to nature, and the processes by which consumers come to view nature as part of their extended self to develop concern for nature, thus encouraging responsible consumption behaviour. This research contributes to knowledge in consumer research by exploring key drivers of responsible consumption attitudes and behaviour. Implications for theory, social marketing and policy development are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|As {{industrialization}} proliferated various manufacturers began exploring {{concepts of}} what is now called lean manufacturing to maximize industrial efficiency. This included a trend to produce goods with certain specifications and according to standards for production. Government agencies in the United States in particular started demanding that manufacturers who bid on government contracts fulfill the work according to predefined standards. Early thinkers, such as Frederick J. Schlink, began to imagine a system for applying similar expectations for standards to consumer needs in order to allow people to make purchases according to product merit rather than rival advertising claims or marketing propaganda. Schlink met Stuart Chase and together they published Your Money's Worth, which was a national guide to fraud and manipulation of the American marketplace due to lack of <b>consumer</b> <b>representation</b> in the regulation process. At the end of this book there was a description of a theoretical [...] "consumers' club" [...] which would test products and serve only the interests of consumers.The success of the book led to the founding of Consumers' Research as the world's first consumer organization.6 This began the consumer movement.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{seeks to}} examine the role of <b>consumer</b> <b>representation</b> in {{communications}} policymaking {{with a focus on}} the UK. It aims to review the role of the Communications Consumer Panel and to argue that there is an important role to play for a consumer advocate due to behavioural biases, information overload, and market failure. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on analysis of all relevant reports and documentation published by the Ofcom Consumer Panel, as well as participant observation carried out by the author {{as a member of the}} panel. It also analyses switching data to make the case that the communications sector may be unique in terms of the low levels of switching between suppliers. Findings: The paper finds that there is an ongoing role for a consumer advocate in media and communications and that this body should be independent of government and the regulatory agency. Research limitations/implications: The limitation of this research is that it focuses principally on only one sector, though it does reference a literature that covers other sectors, and in a paper of this length full comparison of other sectors would be impossible. Practical implications: The paper suggests that the communications sector would be well served by its own separate <b>consumer</b> <b>representation</b> body and that this should have close links to, but be independent of, Ofcom. Social implications: This paper has relevance to <b>consumer</b> <b>representation</b> in communications regulation and policy in countries beyond the UK. It examines the peculiarity of the communications market and the particular difficulties consumers face in fast moving technically challenging markets. Originality/value: The paper examines a particularly important sector of <b>consumer</b> <b>representation</b> at a time when policy on a new regulatory structure is being set. It offers the perspective of a researcher who has also been a member of the Consumer panel, and, as such, it provides valuable insight at a crucial time...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. There {{is ongoing}} {{controversy}} {{as to whether}} the genome is representing system (Sterelny et al. 1996, Griffiths 2001). Although it is widely recognised that DNA carries information, both correlating with and coding for various outcomes, neither of these implies that the genome has semantic properties like correctness or satisfaction conditions (Godfrey-Smith 2002). Here a modified version of teleosemantics is applied to the genome to show that it does indeed have semantic properties − there is representation in the genome. The account differs in three respects from previous attempts to apply teleosemantics to genes. It emphasises the role of the <b>consumer</b> of <b>representations</b> (in addition to their mode of production). It rejects the standard assumption that genetic representation can be used to explain the course of an organism’s development. And it identifies the explanatory role played by representational properties of the genome. A striking consequence of this account is that other inheritance systems could also be representational. Thus, a version of the parity thesis is accepted (Griffiths 2001). However, the criteria for being an inheritance system are demanding, so semantic properties are not ubiquitous...|$|R
40|$|Communications {{consumers}} in the UK do not switch provider enough, {{and when they do}} they sometimes do so irrationally. As the government conducts a welcome review of the landscape of <b>consumer</b> <b>representation</b> in the UK, they should be aware that there is an ongoing, permanent need for <b>consumer</b> <b>representation</b> that is specific to the communications sector. The government’s proposals, by shifting consumer advocacy to the Citizen’s Advice Bureau, are likely to result in an increase in costs to the public purse. Within the current model Ofcom and its consumer panel receive almost half their funding from the private sector. If the body is moved to Citizens Advice, the proportion met by public funding will be higher. The fast changing, technical complexity of the communications sector makes a consumer representative particularly important. Consumer advocacy in communications will be most efficient if it is within Ofcom, but has much more effective operational independence from it...|$|E

40|$|This {{book is a}} brief {{attempt to}} discuss some {{emerging}} ways of representing ‘masculinities’ in contemporary media discourses. The confluence of diverse discourses on gender, men, and hegemony has often resulted {{in the creation of}} a general and rather fuzzy category that scholars frequently refer to as ‘hegemonic masculinity’. This arbitrary phrase has been misapplied for over 60 years, and surprisingly, it still carries considerable weight today. On the one hand, ‘hegemonic masculinity’ tends to anchor the extensive field of men’s studies, also known as masculinity studies (the critical studies of men) within feminist accounts of patriarchy and sociological models of gender. On the other hand, and this is the main acceptation in this book, the expression is often held accountable for the dissemination of popular anxieties about men as social actors. Using Multimodal Critical Discourse Analysis as a methodological framework, this book outlines how masculine identities interact with the consumption of products, desires, and passions in <b>consumer</b> cultures. <b>Representations</b> of the male body are seen as discursive ‘ploys’ construed at the intersection of consumption and marketing across cultures in multimodal discourses. The book analyses a small corpus, the MALEcorpus, comprising 10 print covers from the British edition of the well-known and bestseller magazine Men’s Health. In view of this, the book investigates how masculinity is constructed, both verbally and visually, on ten covers of the British men’s magazine...|$|R
