Using the fullydistributed CRLH based phase shifter, a <b>ring</b> <b>coupler</b> is configured and analyzed in comparison with the traditional <b>ring</b> <b>coupler,</b> showing that both couplers have similar characteristics.

The measured results of miniaturized <b>ring</b> <b>coupler</b> by method 2 are shown in Figure 10. Obviously, the two results are quite similar except for the return loss, because the return loss is more sensitive to microstrip line width. Other deviations between the numerical and measured results may account for the manufac-turing inaccuracy, including round-off error, as described above. 4. CONCLUSION In this study, two simple methods for miniaturizing <b>ring</b> <b>couplers</b> have been proposed and verified. The size of the traditional <b>ring</b> <b>coupler</b> was reduced by connecting multiple open stubs inside the ring. The major advantages of the proposed methods are that the reduced size can be arbitrary and without any other lumped ele-ment or via hole, thus leading to low cost and easy fabrication. Both methods were applied {{to reduce the size of}} the <b>ring</b> <b>coupler</b> successfully. However, the frequency response of the g/ 8 equiv-alent-circuit method is better than that of the g/ 4 equivalent-circuit method. Thus, it is concluded that the g/ 8 equivalent-circuit method is preferable in most cases, except for the situation of high dielectric constant or thin substrate. In these cases, the formal one is a better choice due to the restriction of manufactur-ing precision...|$|R

The device {{consists of a}} ring resonator fed by a directional <b>coupler,</b> where the <b>ring</b> resonator path includes a leaky-wave antenna segment. The resonator integration provides two main advantages: the high-quality factor ensures effective control of radiation intensity by controlling the resonance conditions and the efficient radiation from a leaky-wave antenna even when its length is {{much smaller than the}} propagation length of the leaky wave. We devise an analytical model of the guided wave propagation along a directional <b>coupler</b> and the <b>ring</b> resonator path including the antenna and non-radiating segments. The trade-offs regarding the quality factor of resonance and the antenna efficiency of such a design is reported in terms of the coupler parameters, leaky-wave constant and radiation length.

The simulation results together with the analytical model show that slight variations in the leaky-wave's propagation constant, realized through excitation of excess carriers in Si domain, is sufficient to control the far-field radiation modulation with high extinction ratio.
