In furtherance of this, he appointed Garry McCarthy, former deputy commissioner of operations of the New York City Police Department, {{as director of the}} Newark Police Department. Crime reduction was such a <b>central</b> <b>concern</b> to the Booker administration that Booker, along with his security team, was known to personally patrol the streets of Newark until as late as 4a.m.|$|E
5|$|Physiologists such as Claude Bernard {{explored}} (through vivisection {{and other}} experimental methods) {{the chemical and}} physical functions of living bodies to an unprecedented degree, {{laying the groundwork for}} endocrinology (a field that developed quickly after the discovery of the first hormone, secretin, in 1902), biomechanics, and the study of nutrition and digestion. The importance and diversity of experimental physiology methods, within both medicine and biology, grew dramatically over {{the second half of the}} 19th century. The control and manipulation of life processes became a <b>central</b> <b>concern,</b> and experiment was placed at the center of biological education.|$|E

5|$|As a result, the fielding of {{a respectable}} hoplite army without mercenaries or freed helots was difficult. Cleomenes {{increased}} the number of full citizens again and made the Spartan army operate with an increased reliance on more lightly armored phalangites of the Macedonian style. However, many of these restored citizens were killed in the Battle of Sellasia and Nabis' politics drove the remainder of them into exile. In consequence, the heavy troops were no longer available in sufficient numbers. This led to a serious decline in Sparta's military power, and the aim of Nabis reforms was to reestablish a class of loyal subjects capable of serving as well-equipped phalangites (operating in a close and deep formation, with a longer spear than the hoplites'). Nabis' liberation of the enslaved helots {{was one of the most}} outstanding deeds in Spartan history. With this action, Nabis eliminated a central ideological pillar of the old Spartan social system and the chief reason for objection to Spartan expansion by the surrounding poleis (city-states). Guarding against helot revolt had been, until this time, the <b>central</b> <b>concern</b> of Spartan foreign policy, and the need to protect against internal revolt had limited adventurism abroad; Nabis' action abolished this concern with a single stroke. His freed helots received land from him and were wedded to wealthy wives of the exiled Spartan demos (all former full citizens) and widows of the rich elite, whose husbands had been killed at his orders.|$|E

25|$|Lacan's {{concept of}} desire {{is related to}} Hegel's Begierde, a term that implies a {{continuous}} force, and therefore somehow differs from Freud's concept of Wunsch.

25|$|An independent, {{critical}} {{voice on}} politics, literature, science, {{and the arts}} seems as much needed {{today as it was}} when Barbara Epstein and I put out the first edition of the New York Review fifty years ago – perhaps even more so. Electronic forms of communication grow rapidly in every field of life but many of their effects on culture remain obscure and in need of new kinds of critical scrutiny. That will be a <b>central</b> <b>concern</b> of the Review for the years to come.|$|E
25|$|Historians have {{emphasized}} that the sense of honor was a <b>central</b> <b>concern</b> of upper-class white Southerners. The idea of being treated like a second-class citizen was anathema {{and could not be}} tolerated by an honorable southerner. The abolitionist position held that slavery was a negative or evil phenomenon that damaged the rights of white men and the prospects of republicanism. To the white South this rhetoric made Southerners second-class citizens because it trampled what they believed was their Constitutional right to take their chattel property anywhere.|$|E

25|$|The <b>central</b> <b>concern</b> of {{the task}} force was lack of {{cooperation}} within the US Intelligence Community. Specifically, it cited the poor relationship of the CIA to G-2 of the US Army, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Atomic Energy Commission, and the US State Department. According to the report, this poor relationship had caused an unsatisfactory number of “disparate intelligence estimates,” which “have often been subjective and biased.” Lastly, the report encouraged older entities in the US Intelligence Community to embrace the newly created CIA as a partner.|$|E
25|$|Seton Hall {{takes as}} its mission the {{development}} of the whole man—spiritual, intellectual, social and physical. Seton Hall community proceeds from a belief that growth as a whole person is not limited to secular knowledge but involves the spiritual fulfillment that has been a <b>central</b> <b>concern</b> in its educational tradition. In as much as such growth and maturity are rooted in personal and social responsibility, a code of conduct and expectations is in place to guide the student community in their daily activities. Consequent to its Catholic identity, the Prep seeks to foster an ecumenical and diverse community, faithful to a Judeo-Christian heritage.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{challenges}} in defining death is in distinguishing it from life. Death would seem to refer to either the moment life ends, or when the state that follows life begins. However, determining when death has occurred is difficult, as cessation of life functions is often not simultaneous across organ systems. Such determination therefore requires drawing conceptual lines between life and death. This is problematic, however, because there is little consensus over how to define life. The nature of death has for millennia been a <b>central</b> <b>concern</b> of the world's religious traditions and of philosophical inquiry. Many religions maintain faith in either a kind of afterlife or reincarnation for the soul, or resurrection of the body at a later date.|$|E

25|$|The fate of Israel is of <b>central</b> <b>concern</b> because Israel is the elect {{people of}} God through whom God's redemptive {{work is done}} in the world. However tragic human {{suffering}} is on the human plane, what happens to Israel is directly tied to its role as that nation to which God attaches His name and through which He will redeem man. He who strikes Israel, therefore, engages himself in battle with God and {{it is for this reason}} that the history of Israel is the fulcrum of human history. The suffering of others must, therefore, be seen in the light of Israel's suffering. The travail of man is not abandoned, precisely because Israel suffers and, thereby, God's presence is drawn into human history and redemption enters the horizon of human existence.|$|E
25|$|VII follows Cloud Strife, {{a troubled}} {{mercenary}} who joins with an eco-terrorist group to stop Shinra from draining {{the life of}} the Planet to use as an energy source. As the story progresses, conflicts escalate and the world's safety becomes their <b>central</b> <b>concern</b> as new forces emerge to challenge the original group. Cloud and his team eventually face off against the game's antagonist, Sephiroth. Other important characters in the series include Aerith Gainsborough, a flower seller who becomes a good friend to Cloud; Zack Fair, Cloud's friend, a former soldier of Shinra and the protagonist of Crisis Core; and Vincent Valentine, a man made immortal by Shinra experimentation and the protagonist of Dirge of Cerberus. The conflict between Cloud and Sephiroth forms the core narrative around which many of the series' stories are built. Other characters include the Turks, a covert group which originally worked for Shinra.|$|E
500|$|Preparation {{for a new}} Mongol {{invasion}} was the <b>central</b> <b>concern</b> of Béla's policy. In {{a letter}} of 1247 to Pope Innocent IV, Béla announced his plan to strengthen the Danubethe [...] "river of confrontations"with new forts. He abandoned the ancient royal prerogative to build and own castles, promoting the erection of nearly 100 new fortresses {{by the end of}} his reign. These fortresses included a new castle Béla had built at Nagysáros (Veľký Šariš, Slovakia), and another castle Béla and his wife had built at Visegrád.|$|E

500|$|Territorial {{occupation}} only {{became a}} <b>central</b> <b>concern</b> for Portugal {{in the last}} decades of the 19th century, during the European powers' [...] "Scramble for Africa", especially following the 1884 Berlin Conference. A number of military expeditions were organized as preconditions for obtaining territory which roughly corresponded to that of present-day Angola. However, as late as 1906 only about 6% of that territory was effectively occupied, and the military campaigns had to continue. By the mid-1920s, {{the limits of the}} territory were finally fixed, and the last [...] "primary resistance" [...] was quelled in the early 1940s. It is thus reasonable to talk of Angola as a defined territorial entity from this point onwards.|$|E
500|$|Often grouped {{with urban}} and rural {{sociology}} is that of community sociology or the sociology of community. Taking various communities—including online communities—as the unit of analysis, community sociologists study the origin and effects of different associations of people. For instance, German sociologist Ferdinand Tönnies distinguished between two types of human association: Gemeinschaft (usually translated as [...] "community") and Gesellschaft ("society" [...] or [...] "association"). In his 1887 work, Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft, Tönnies argued that Gemeinschaft {{is perceived to be}} a tighter and more cohesive social entity, due to the presence of a [...] "unity of will". The 'development' or 'health' of a community is also a <b>central</b> <b>concern</b> of community sociologists also engage in development sociology, exemplified by the literature surrounding the concept of social capital.|$|E
500|$|The Passion of Christ {{became a}} <b>central</b> <b>concern</b> {{during the early}} {{development}} of Bacon's work, and {{he returned to the}} subject throughout his career. When asked by critic Jean Clair why his Crucifixion scenes tended to comprise mainly [...] "slaughter, butchery, mutilated meat and flesh", Bacon replied, [...] "that's all the Crucifixion was, isn't it?... Actually, you can't think of anything more barbaric than the Crucifixion, and that particular way of killing somebody." [...] While Three Studies may have begun as an attempt to directly represent the Crucifixion scene, his explorations led him towards [...] "something completely different". Bacon came to regard the scene as an armature for exploring new ways of representing human behaviours and emotions. For him it amounted to a kind of self-portraiture; a vehicle for working on [...] "all sorts of very private feelings about behaviour and about the way life is".|$|E
