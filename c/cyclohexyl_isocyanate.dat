40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Certain 2 - chioroethyl nitrosoureas {{have been}} {{demonstrated}} to be highly specific inactivators of chymotrypsin in vitro and glutathione reductase, both in vivo and in isolated rat hepatocytes. The inactivation of glutathione reductase in isolated hepatocytes resulted in an increased sensitivity toward an adriamycin induced oxidative challenge. Prolonged incubation of 1 -(2 -chloroethyl) - 3 -([1 -¹⁴ C] cyclohexyl) - 1 -nitrosourea (CCNU) with chymotrypsin resulted in covalent modification and concomitant inactivation of chymotrypsin via degradation of the nitrosourea to form <b>cyclohexyl</b> <b>isocyanate.</b> <b>Cyclohexyl</b> <b>isocyanate</b> was shown to be an active-site-directed inactivator of chymotrypsin. L-Lysine did not protect the enzyme from inactivation by <b>cyclohexyl</b> <b>isocyanate.</b> Degradation of an excess of 1 -(2 -chloroethyl) - 3 - ([1 -¹⁴c] -cyclohexyl) - 1 -nitrosourea in the presence of*enzyme yielded 1. 11 ±. 07 mole of enzyme inactivated. Short-term incubation demonstrated that the nitrosourea neither inhibited nor protected the enzyme from <b>cyclohexyl</b> <b>isocyanate</b> inactivation. Treatment of chymotrypsin with less than stoichiometric amounts of <b>cyclohexyl</b> <b>isocyanate</b> or titration of the active site serine with phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride prior to [¹⁴ C]- labeling resulted in a proportional decrease in bound [¹⁴C] cyclohexyl moiety. In addition, the specific inactivation of yeast glutathione reductase by 2 -chloroethyl isocyanate and <b>cyclohexyl</b> <b>isocyanate</b> derived from their respective 2 -chloroethyl nitrosoureas has been demonstrated. Titration of the enzyme with 2 -chloroethyl isocyanate or [¹⁴ C] labeling with 1 -(2 -chloroethyl) - 3 -([1 - ¹⁴C]chclohexyl) - 1 -nitrosourea or 1, 3 -bis-(2 -[¹⁴C]chloroethyl) - 1 -nitrosourea (BCNU) resulted in a near stoichiometric inactivation and/or covalent labeling of the enzyme. In addition to BCNU and CCNU several other 2 -chloroethyl nitrosoureas were capable of inactivation of not only purified glutathione reductase, but also the activity of this enzyme in cell-free extracts of murine lymphoma L 5178 Y ascites tumor cells and murine bone marrow. A positive correlation has been shown between the ability of certain 2 -chloroethyl nitrosoureas to inactivate glutathione reductase {{and the degree of}} myelotoxicity observed for these nitrosoureas. Incubation of isolated rat hepatocytes with BCNU resulted in the selective and extensive (> 90...|$|E
40|$|Abstract：Biomedical {{transparent}} poly(carbonate-urethane) elastomers were synthesized by melting pre-polymer method, using 4, 4 ’-methylenebis (<b>cyclohexyl</b> <b>isocyanate)</b> (H 12 MDI) {{and chain}} extender (butadiene) (BDO) as hard segment, poly(1, 6 -hexanediol) carbonate diols(PCDL) as soft segment, and dibutyltin dilaurate as catalyst. The effects of molar {{ratio of the}} reactants on mechanical properties of PCU were studied {{and the relationship between}} micro-phase separation structure and properties was analyzed by the contact angle determination, total reflection fourier transform infrared spectrography(ATR-FTIR), differential scanning calorimeter(DSC),gel permeation chromatograph (GPC), mechanical property test. The comparative analysis was made between the prepared material and commercial medical polyurethane materials, showing the prepared poly(carbonate-urethane) elastomers was better in mechanical properties. As a elastic biomedical material, it has a great potential for developments and applications in biomedical materials...|$|E
40|$|Amidations of {{abietic acid}} and rosin with isocyanates, a novel {{approach}} to modify rosin, were invest,igated using three isocyanates, namely <b>cyclohexyl</b> <b>isocyanate,</b> phenyl isocyanate, and tollyl isocyanate. The experimental results demonstrate that abietic acid and rosin reacted with the three isocyanates at 100 to 150 ℃ for 1 to 5 h to produce rosin amides in yields of 90 to 100 %. The reaction temperatures were much lower than 200 to 300 ℃ at which conventional modifications of rosin are carried out. The amidation of abietic acid with phenyl isocyanate in toluene proceeded much faster than that in acetone or dioxane. The addition of triethylamine or N-methylpiperidine as a catalyst greatly accelerated the amidation rates of abietic acid and rosin with phenyl isocyanate. Molten rosin could react, with phenyl isocyanate without using a solvent, which can shorten synthetic route of rosin amides, and reduce reaction times. The rosin amides prepared under these conditions were in light color, and suffered from little oxidation and decarboxylation...|$|E
40|$|Benzyl isocyanide, <b>cyclohexyl</b> isocyanide, benzyl <b>isocyanate,</b> methyl isocyanate, benzyl isothiocyanate, and {{methyl isothiocyanate}} were each tested for ethylene-like {{activity}} in a pea (Pisum sativum) growth assay. Only the isocyanides gave an ethylene-like response; the concentration that gave a half-maximal response was approximately 10 to 15 microliters per liter for each isocyanide, and this activity was inhibited by norbornadiene, a competitive inhibitor of ethylene action. Since the isocyanides did not promote endogenous ethylene production, {{it was concluded}} that the isocyanides acted directly to give an ethylene-like response. The isocyanides were further shown to elicit ethylene-like activity in a potato (Solanum tuberosum) tuber respiration assay, in a carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus) senescence assay and in a carrot (Daucus carota L.) isocoumarin formation assay. The feasibility of employing azido derivatives of benzyl isocyanide to photoaffinity label ethylene receptors in vivo is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Shape Memory Polymer (SMP) is one {{of smart}} {{materials}} class that {{has the ability to}} recall a given shape before deformation in the transient state. The development of SMP is dominated by polyurethane which is currently focused on the optimization of manufacturing-related research (ease of processing), and the extraction of the potential for biomedical applications. In this study, Shape Memory Polyurethane (SMPU) with Polyethylene Glycol-based material (PEG mw: 6000) as soft segment, 4, 4 '-Methylenebis (<b>Cyclohexyl</b> <b>isocyanate)</b> (HMDI) as a hard segment and 1, 1, 1 -Trimethylol propane (TMP) as a chain extender were used as a candidate for Vascular Stents. Materials used for the fillers were nano particles of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) which have 20 – 50 nm diameters. Variations of the composition were used as a variable. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) were conducted to investigate the polymer chains which were formed during polymerization, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) was used to analyze the interface between the filler and the composite matrix. Manual physical actuation was conducted to analyze the physical recovery and transition temperature of the SMPU. Composition and fillers effect on the performance of SMPU composite were discussed in detail along with analysis of its structure and molecular design...|$|E
40|$|We tested whether {{pretreatment}} of reagents {{known to}} induce hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 (HIF- 1) may confer chemoresistance against cytotoxicity of 1, 3 -bis(2 -chloroethyl) - 1 -nitrosourea (BCNU) to rat C 6 glioma cells. We also studied which cytotoxic mechanism(s) of chloroethylnitrosoureas could be neutralized by cobalt preconditioning. Preconditioning of rat C 6 glioma cells with cobalt chloride (300 μM, 2 h) induced HIF- 1 binding activity based on electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Results from Western blotting confirmed a heightened HIF- 1 α level upon cobalt chloride exposure (300 – 400 μM, 2 h). Cobalt chloride (300 μM) pretreatment for 2 h substantially neutralized BCNU toxicity, leading {{to increases in}} glioma cell survival based on MTT assay. In addition, pre-exposure of C 6 cells with desferrioxamine (DFO; 400 μM, 3 h), an iron chelator known to activate HIF- 1, also induced HIF- 1 binding and rendered the glioma cells resistant to cytotoxicity of BCNU. Pre-incubation with cobalt chloride abolished the cytotoxicity of several carbamoylating agents including 2 -chloroethyl isocyanate and <b>cyclohexyl</b> <b>isocyanate,</b> the respective carbamoylating metabolites of BCNU and 1 -(2 -chloroethyl) - 3 -cyclohexyl- 1 -nitrosourea. The protective effect of cobalt exposure, however, was not observed when cells were challenged with alkylating agents including temozolomide. Cadmium chloride (50 μM) effectively reversed cobalt-induced HIF- 1 activation. Correspondingly, cadmium chloride suppressed carbamoylating chemoresistance mediated by cobalt chloride pretreatment. Furthermore, both double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) decoy with HIF- 1 cognate sequence and antisense phosphorothioate ODNs against HIF- 1 α partially abolished the carbamoylating chemoresistance associated with cobalt preconditioning. Our results suggest that cobalt- or DFO-preconditioning may enhance glioma carbamoylating chemoresistance that is dependent, at least in part, on induction of HIF- 1...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to clarify the {{mechanism}} of the potentiation by amphotericin B (AMB) of 1 -(2 -chloroethyl) - 3 -cyclohexyl- 1 -nitrosourea (CCNU) antineoplastic effects on s. c. murine ependymoblastoma. The effect of AMB on tumor cell permeability to CCNU labeled on the cyclohexyl moiety was studied. The radioactivity measured in ependymoblastoma 1, 6, 14, and 25 hr after i. m. Injection of 10. 4 μCi of 1 -(2 -chloroethyl) - 3 -[cyc/o/?exy/- 1 - 14 CJcyclohexyl- 1 -nitrosourea per mouse was significantly higher (p < 0. 001) in the tumors of animals treated with AMB (25 mg/kg 10 hr prior to [14 C]CCNU) as compared to controls. The effects of AMB and CCNU given separately or in combination on RNA and protein synthesis were studied by measuring the incorporation of [3 H]uridine and [14 C]leucine, respectively, into RNA and proteins. The administration of AMB (25 mg/kg) or CCNU (10 mg/kg) did not affect the incorporation of [3 H]uridine measured 2 hr after the i. p. injection of 40 μCi of labeled precursor per mouse. On the other hand, the incorporation of [3 H]uridine was significantly (ρ < 0. 001) inhibited in animals treated with AMB (25 mg/kg) followed 10 hr later by CCNU (10 mg/kg), as compared to animals receiving CCNU alone. The inhibition, which reached a maximum of about 35 % 24 hr after the administration of CCNU, was not observed when AMB was given after CCNU. The inhibition of RNA synthesis was also observed in mice treated with AMB and <b>cyclohexyl</b> <b>isocyanate</b> (5. 4 mg/kg), a degradation product of CCNU. Measurements of [14 C]leucine incorporation showed that AMB did not increase the inhibition of protein synthesis produced by CCNU. These observations suggest that AMB increases the uptake of a cyclohexyl derivative arising from the degradation of CCNU. The increased uptake of this compound results in inhibition of RNA synthesis. This mechanism could account for the potentiation of the CCNU therapeutic effect produced by AMB, at least in murine ependymoblastoma.
