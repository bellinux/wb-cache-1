5|$|In {{completely}} arbitrary fashion <b>Collet</b> {{chose the}} names of six composers, Auric, Durey, Honegger, Poulenc, Tailleferre and myself, {{for no other reason}} than that we knew each other, that we were friends and were represented in the same programmes, but without the slightest concern for our different attitudes and our different natures. Auric and Poulenc followed the ideas of Cocteau, Honegger was a product of German Romanticism and my leanings were towards a Mediterranean lyrical art... Collet's article made such a wide impression that the Groupe des Six had come into being.|$|E

5|$|The {{internal}} {{metal parts}} of a torch are made of hard alloys of copper or brass so it can transmit current and heat effectively. The tungsten electrode must be held firmly {{in the center of}} the torch with an appropriately sized <b>collet,</b> and ports around the electrode provide a constant flow of shielding gas. Collets are sized according to the diameter of the tungsten electrode they hold. The body of the torch is made of heat-resistant, insulating plastics covering the metal components, providing insulation from heat and electricity to protect the welder.|$|E
5|$|The Steynings {{family owned}} Holnicote until the direct male line became extinct {{with the death}} of Charles Staynings (1622–1700). His wife, Susanna (died 1685), was a {{daughter}} of Sir Nicholas Martyn of Oxton and Steynings's heir was their nephew, William Martyn. According to records of the Heralds' Visitations of Devon and research by the Victorian historian J. L. Vivian, this William Martyn lived in Oxton in the parish of Kenton, Devon; he was Susanna Martyn's great-nephew and died in 1710, aged 30. He sold the estate to William Blackford, a Master in Chancery. Blackford then bought the manors of Bossington and Avill, the latter from Anthony Stocker and his wife, Sarah; this estate extended from the ridge of Grabbist nearly to the sea-shore and also included land in the parishes of Dunster, Carhampton, Crowcombe, Stogumber, Timberscombe and St. Decumans. He married Elizabeth, a daughter of John Dyke of Pixton, and died in 1728. His son, William, succeeded him and married Henrietta <b>Collet</b> (died 1727), a daughter and co-heiress of Joseph <b>Collet</b> of Hertford Castle in Hertfordshire. However, he died only three years after his father. Their only daughter and heiress, Henrietta Blackford, inherited the estate as an infant, but died aged 7 in 1733. The estates were divisible upon a great-aunt, Elizabeth Dyke (died 1737), and a second cousin, Elizabeth, a daughter of Thomas Dyke of Tetton and Mary, a daughter of Elizabeth Dyke (died 1737). Later in 1733, Elizabeth Dyke (died 1737) conveyed her share in the estate to her only surviving son, Edward Dyke (died 1746) who in turn conveyed his portion to his niece in 1744, making her the sole owner of the entire estate.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{most other}} machine <b>collet</b> systems, 5C collets were {{developed}} primarily for work holding. Superficially similar to R8 collets, 5C collets have an external thread {{at the rear}} for drawing the <b>collet</b> closed and so work pieces may pass right through the <b>collet</b> and chuck (5C collets often also have an internal thread). Collets are also available to hold square stock. 5C collets have a limited closing range and so shank and <b>collet</b> diameters must be a close match.|$|E

25|$|Generally, a <b>collet</b> chuck, {{considered}} as a unit, consists of a tapered receiving sleeve (sometimes integral with the machine spindle), the <b>collet</b> proper (usually made of spring steel) which is inserted into the receiving sleeve, and (often) a cap that screws over the <b>collet,</b> clamping it via another taper.|$|E
25|$|An {{internal}} <b>collet</b> {{can be used}} to lock two telescoping tubes together. In {{this case}} the <b>collet</b> {{is in the form of}} a truncated cone drilled and threaded down the centreline. The <b>collet</b> diameter matches the bore of the inner tube, having the larger end slightly greater than the bore while the smaller diameter is slightly less than the bore. A threaded stud, anchored at its other end to the tube, is then used to pull the <b>collet</b> into the tube. The increasing diameter of the <b>collet</b> forces the inner tube to expand and be pushed against the inner wall of the outer tube thus locking the two tubes together. The inner tube is often slotted to facilitate this expansion.|$|E
25|$|As {{the tool}} is used further {{rotation}} tightens the <b>collet</b> and the centering pin ensures that tool extension and alignment remain unchanged. A spanner is only required {{to release the}} locked <b>collet.</b>|$|E

25|$|In use, {{the part}} {{to be held}} is {{inserted}} into the <b>collet</b> and then the <b>collet</b> is driven (using a nose cap) or drawn (using a drawbar) into the body which has a matching taper. When properly tightened, enough {{force is applied to}} securely clamp the workpiece or tool.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} types of <b>collet</b> used in the {{metalworking}} industry. Common industry-standard designs are R8 (internally threaded for mills) and 5C (usually externally threaded for lathes). There are also proprietary designs which only fit one manufacturer's equipment. Collets can range in holding capacity from zero to several inches in diameter. The {{most common type of}} <b>collet</b> grips a round bar or tool, but there are collets for square, hexagonal, and other shapes. In addition to the outside-holding collets, there are collets used for holding a part on its inside surface {{so that it can be}} machined on the outside surface (similar to an expanding mandrel). Furthermore, it is not uncommon for machinists to make a custom <b>collet</b> to hold any unusual size or shape of part. These are often called emergency collets (e-collets) or soft collets (from the fact that they are bought in a soft (unhardened) state and machined as needed). Yet another type of <b>collet</b> is a step <b>collet</b> which steps up to a larger diameter from the spindle and allows holding of larger workpieces.|$|E

25|$|Most {{internal}} combustion engines use a split <b>collet</b> to hold both the inlet and exhaust valves under constant valve spring pressure which returns the valves to their closed position when the camshaft lobes {{are not in}} contact with the top of the valves. The two <b>collet</b> halves have an internal raised rib which locate into a circular groove near the top of each valve stem, the outer side of the <b>collet</b> halves are a taper fit into the spring retainer (also known as a collar), this taper locks the retainer in place and the raised rib that sits in the circular groove on the valve stem also locks the <b>collet</b> halves in place to the valve stem. To remove the valves from a cylinder head a 'valve spring compressor' is used to compress the valve springs by exerting force on the spring retainer which allows the collets to be removed, when the compressor is removed, the retainer, spring and valve can then be removed from the cylinder head. It may be realized that the retainer does not budge when the valve spring compressor is used, this is due to a buildup of carbon which over time has locked the retainer and collets slightly. A slight sharp tap on the backside of the valve spring compressor above the valve stem should free the retainer allowing the springs to be compressed whilst retrieving the split <b>collet.</b> On reassembly it is difficult to keep the split collets in place whilst the compressor is released, by applying a small amount of grease to the internal side of the split collets will keep them in place on the valve stem whilst releasing the compressor, then as the spring retainer rises it locks the tapered split collets in place.|$|E
