In any case, the definition of the Fahrenheit scale has changed since.|$|E

50|$|Titanium in zircon {{geothermometry}} has so {{far been}} used in igneous rocks to estimate cooling temperatures of magma from zircon crystals dated to the Hadean age (>4.0 Ga). Low crystallization temperatures from zircons of this age suggests the Hadean Earth contained liquid water, which reduced the <b>cooling</b> <b>temperature</b> of crustal materials. Potentially, Ti-in-zircon thermometry of Earth's oldest zircons can show the progressive heat loss from a magmatic Hadean Earth to the onset of plate tectonics as the planet's crust began to cool and underwent plastic deformation. This will provide previously unknown evidence for the conditions in early Earth and allow testing of ideas of how the planet evolved through the Hadean and Archean eons.|$|E

The aim {{of the study was}} to test the effect of condensation temperature on the parameters of exhaled breath condensate and the levels of selected biomarkers. Methods Exhaled breath condensate was collected from 24 healthy subjects at temperatures of - 10, - 5, 0 and + 5 C degrees. Selected parameters (condensed volume and conductivity) and biomarkers (hydrogen peroxide, malondialdehyde) were measured. Results There was a progressive increase in hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde concentrations, and condensate conductivity as the <b>cooling</b> <b>temperature</b> increased; total condensate volume increased as the <b>cooling</b> <b>temperature</b> decreased. Conclusion The <b>cooling</b> <b>temperature</b> of exhaled breath condensate collection influenced selected biomarkers and potential normalizing factors (particularly conductivity) in different ways ex vivo. The temperature of exhaled breath condensate collection should be controlled and reported. </p...|$|E
