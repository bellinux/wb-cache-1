50|$|Parties {{who enter}} into {{mediation}} do not forfeit legal rights or remedies. If mediation does {{not result in}} settlement, each side can continue to enforce their rights through appropriate court or tribunal procedures. However, if mediation produces a settlement, legal rights and obligations are affected in differing degrees. In some situations, the parties may accept a memorandum or moral force agreement; these are often found in <b>community</b> <b>mediations.</b> In other instances, a more comprehensive deed of agreement, when registered with a court, is legally binding. It is advisable to have a lawyer draft or provide legal advice about the proposed terms.|$|R

The tribes often lacked a central governing power, instead {{turning to a}} village [...] "headman" [...] who rose {{to a position of}} social esteem through skill, hard work, and luck in hunting and farming. These individuals often formed councils consisting of young warriors for protection and village elders to serve as consultants in village affairs. This governing group would broker trades with neighboring tribes, as well as make important decisions for the tribe members. Within these tribal groups, it was not uncommon for ceremonial face masks to serve dual roles in rituals and politics.

This article examines Prevent's changing focus of 'responsibilisation' and, in response, changing experiences of contestation by both the local state and by local Muslim <b>communities,</b> including <b>mediation</b> and 'enactment' by organisations and individual professionals. In discussing this, the article argues for a more nuanced analysis of Prevent, around both the 'state' and the situated use of agency and policy space.

40|$|Experience {{from other}} {{countries}} in the juvenile justice system proves that the reintegration of juveniles and young offenders into society, with a traditional legal system is rather difficult because there is some confusion about the legal status and rights of these minors. For this reason, the expansion of restorative justice tends to become, today, the main trend of youth justice reform in most contemporary societies. Unlike traditional criminal justice retributive nature, that focuses on punishment, by imposing tough sanctions against the author, depending on the crime’s gravity, the restorative justice is built on a practical system of rules and principles designed to ensure a proper treatment, for the victim and also for the offender, as through active community involvement in the process of mediation between the parties involved. The importance of <b>community</b> services and <b>mediation</b> lies in their ability to avoid passing through the juvenile court proceedings, thereby reducing the negative consequences this would have on them. restorative justice, alternative sanctions, juvenile <b>mediation,</b> <b>community...</b>|$|R
50|$|In some situations, a post-mediation {{debriefing}} {{and feedback}} session is conducted between co-mediators or between mediators and supervisors.

50|$|Like in {{imperial}} times, resolving {{disputes in}} China has {{relied heavily on}} <b>community</b> <b>mediation</b> rather than litigation within a formal court system.

40|$|The text aims {{to analyse}} how women from {{religious}} minority communities (Muslim, Evangelic and Orthodox ones) living in urban Aragonian contexts see this religious belonging {{as well as}} their woman condition, mediate their dynamics of sociability and social visibility. From an ethnomethodological perspective, we conducted discourse analysis to the discourse obtained through in-deep interviews to women who belong to these religious minorities. These women share a common understanding on a visibility signed by a multiple otherness: this derived from their religion, the foreignness associated to it, and their woman condition. At the same time, there is a dual —both emotional and functional— nature to the religious <b>communities</b> as <b>mediation</b> of dynamics of sociability for these women. Visibility and sociability are articulated, to this way, on the mediation derived from the women condition and the religious belonging...|$|R
40|$|Mediator {{neutrality}} {{continues to}} be a highly debated and contested concept for mediation practice. This thesis proposes a model for the practice of neutrality in mediation that is drawn from an empirical study of mediators’ understanding of the concept, and a review and reconstruction of scholarly definitions and descriptions. The empirical component of the study consists of in depth interviews with mediators from two <b>community</b> based <b>mediation</b> services. The main findings of the fieldwork are firstly, that mediators do adopt neutrality as a core principle of practice; secondly, that mediators make sense of neutrality by understanding it in relation to party self determination; and thirdly, that mediators extend the meaning of neutrality, as commonly understood, by creatively employing a range of legal and therapeutic and or community themes.
