The critical component of this system is a <b>column</b> <b>separator,</b> which removes medium while allowing the microcarriers to remain in the culture. Amino acids and ammonia were analysed during cell growth of the perfusion culture. None of the amino acids was completely utilized. The ac-cumulation of ammonia to 2 - 3 mM was observed and may be responsible for, or coincident with, events limiting further cell growth. It is suggested that oxygen deprivation and growth inhibitor accumulation, rather than nutrient depletion, are the major factors in limiting even higher cell yields...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} novel method to {{evaluate}} table segmentation results {{based on a}} table image ground truther. In the ground-truthing process, we first extract connected components from a given table image and connect them into an atom graph with weighed edges. Edge weight takes neighboring connected components ’ size similarities and distances into consideration. Then the ground truther semi-automatically determines the locations and spans of row/column separators according to projection profiles, under human supervision. We evaluate a given table segmentation by computing edit distance from its row and <b>column</b> <b>separator</b> assertions relative to ground truth. The edit distance {{is the sum of}} all the edit operation costs that correct wrong row and column separators. Each edit operation cost {{is a function of the}} sum of the weights of the edges that the separator cuts through. Thus, separator errors incur different costs depending on the severity of the error, where severity roughly corresponds to how forgivable the error would be considered by a human observer. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed evaluation method is not only efficient, but also useful in formalizing the intuitive quality of different segmentations...|$|E

40|$|Most Stata users {{make their}} living {{producing}} results in a form accessible to end users. Most of these end users cannot immediately understand Stata logs. However, they can understand tables (in paper, PDF, HTML, spreadsheet, or word processor documents) and plots (produced by using Stata or non-Stata software). Tables are produced by Stata as resultsspreadsheets, and plots are produced by Stata as resultsplots. Sometimes (but not always), resultsspreadsheets, and resultsplots are produced using resultssets. Resultssets, resultsspreadsheets and resultsplots are all produced, directly or indirectly, as output by Stata commands. A resultsset is a Stata dataset, which is a table whose rows are Stata observations and whose columns are Stata variables. A resultsspreadsheet is a table in generic text format, conforming to a TeX or HTML convention, or to another convention with a <b>column</b> <b>separator</b> string and possibly left and right row delimiter strings. A resultsplot is a plot produced as output, using a resultsset or a resultsspreadsheet as input. Resultsset-producing programs include statsby, parmby, parmest, collapse, contract, xcollapse, and xcontract. Resultsspreadsheet-producing programs include outsheet, listtex, estout, and estimates table. Resultsplot-producing programs include eclplot and mileplot. There are two main approaches (or dogmas) for generating resultsspreadsheets and resultsplots. The resultsset-centered dogma is followed by parmest and parmby users and states: “Datasets make resultssets, which make resultsplots and resultsspreadsheets”. The resultsspreadsheet-centered dogma is followed by estout and estimates table users and states: “Datasets make resultsspreadsheets, which make resultssets, which make resultsplots”. The two dogmas are complementary, and each dogma has its advantages and disadvantages. The resultsspreadsheet dogma is much easier for the casual user to learn to apply in a hurry and is therefore probably preferred by most users most of the time. The resultsset dogma is more difficult for most users to learn but is more convenient for users who wish to program everything in do-files, {{with little or no}} manual cutting and pasting. ...|$|E

40|$|Considerable {{quantities}} of valuable data about product information and financial statements is often available in sources and formats {{that are not}} amenable for querying using traditional database techniques. One such important source is text documents. In such documents these kinds of data often appear in tabular form. A data item in these text tables may span several words (e. g. product description). Furthermore items supposedly within the same column do not necessarily begin or end at the same position. Thus {{the absence of any}} regularity in <b>column</b> <b>separators</b> makes it difficult to automatically mine, i. e. extract data items from text tables. Nevertheless an interesting characteristic often exhibited by these tables is that intra-column items are “closer ” to each other than inter- column items. We exploit this observation to develop a clustering-based technique to extract data items from these tables. In contrast to previous appproaches, a unique and important aspect of using clustering is that it makes the technique robust in the presence of misalignments. We provide a characterization theorem for text tables on which this technique will always produce a correct extraction. We discuss the design and implementation of a system for extracting tabular data based on this clustering technique.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we discuss a hypergraph-based unsymmetric nested {{dissection}} (HUND) ordering for reducing the fill-in incurred during Gaussian elimination. It has several important properties. It takes a global perspective of the entire matrix, as opposed to local heuristics. It takes into account the asymmetry of the input matrix by using a hypergraph to represent its structure. It is suitable for performing Gaussian elimination in parallel, with partial pivoting. This is possible because the row permutations performed due to partial pivoting do not destroy the <b>column</b> <b>separators</b> identified by the nested dissection approach. The hypergraph nested dissection approach is essentially equivalent to graph nested dissection on the matrix ATA, but we need only the original matrix A and never form the usually denser matrix ATA. The usage of hypergraphs in our approach is fairly standard, and HUND can be implemented by calling an existing hypergraph partitioner that uses recursive bisection. Our implementation uses local reordering constrained column approximate minimum degree (CCOLAMD) to further improve the ordering. We also explain how weighted matching (HSL routine MC 64) can be used in this context. Experimental results on 27 medium and large size matrices with highly unsymmetric structures compare our approach to four other well-known reordering algorithms. The results show that it provides a robust reordering algorithm, {{in the sense that it}} is the best or close to the best (often within 10 %) of all the other methods, in particular on matrices with highly unsymmetric structures...|$|R

However, obtaining mature and functional erythrocytes from the immature cell cultures with high purity and in an efficient manner remains a significant challenge. A distinguishing feature of a reticulocyte and maturing erythrocyte is the increasing concentration of hemoglobin and decreasing cell volume that results in increased cell magnetophoretic mobility (MM) when exposed to high magnetic fields and gradients, under anoxic conditions. Taking advantage of these initial observations, we studied a noninvasive (label-free) magnetic separation and analysis process to enrich and identify cultured functional erythrocytes. In addition to the magnetic cell separation and cell motion analysis in the magnetic field, the cell cultures were characterized for cell sedimentation rate, cell volume distributions using differential interference microscopy, immunophenotyping (glycophorin A), hemoglobin concentration and shear-induced deformability (elongation index, EI, by ektacytometry) to test for mature erythrocyte attributes.

Otherwise, the vector particles bind to the producer cells via an interaction between the HA envelope and the receptor sialic acid*. - Fifteen hours after transfection, replace the medium with 6 mL of fresh Cellgro medium. - *This medium is adapted for culture of CD 34 + cells and allows the cytokines displayed on the vector’s surface to maintain their functionality*. - Thirty-six hours after transfection, harvest the vectors, filter through a 0. 45 -μm membrane, and store at − 80 °C. - *Vectors can be stored for 2 - 3 mo*. **Immunoselection of Human CD 34 + Cells** 1. Dilute CB 1 : 1 with PBS. Gently layer 35 mL of the diluted blood on 15 mL of Ficoll-Paque PLUS in a 50 -mL tube. - Centrifuge the cells at 850 g for 30 min at 20 °C with no brake. Collect the layer that contains the mononuclear cells. - *The mononuclear cells are found in a white band {{at the top of the}} Ficoll layer*. - Prepare PBS/ 2 % FCS. Wash the collected mononuclear cells in PBS/ 2 % FCS and centrifuge at 850 g for 10 min at 20 °C. - Resuspend the cells to a concentration of 1 × 10 e 8 to 2 × 10 e 8 cells/mL in PBS/ 2 % FCS. To magnetically label the cells using the CD 34 MicroBead Kit, add Blocking Reagent and then add anti-hCD 34 + MicroBeads according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Incubate while rocking for 30 min at 4 °C. - Wash the cells to remove unbound antibody and resuspend in PBS/ 2 % FCS. - Separate the CD 34 + cells as follows: - i. Wash a MACS cell separation column with 200 μL of PBS/ 2 % FCS. - ii. Add the labeled cells to the column and place it in the MACS separator. - iii. Allow the unlabeled cells to pass through the column. - iv. Wash once with PBS/ 2 % FCS. - v. Remove the <b>column</b> from the <b>separator</b> to elute the CD 34 + cells. - vi. Repeat this procedure once. - *The purity of the CD 34 + cells is routinely 90 %- 95 %*. **Titer Determination** 1. Day − 1 : Seed HeLa cells in DMEM for HSC at a density of 2 × 10 e 5 cells/well in six-well plates in a final volume of 2 mL/well. Incubate overnight. - Day 0 : Prepare serial dilutions of vector preparations, add to the HeLa cells and incubate overnight. - Day 1 : Replace the medium on the cells with 2 mL of fresh DMEM for HSC and incubate for 72 h. - Day 3 : Trypsinize the cells and transfer to flow cytometry tubes. Determine the percentage of GFP-positive cells by flow cytometry. *Infectious titer is expressed as transducing units (TU) /mL and is calculated by the following formula*: *Titer = % GFP-positive cells (number of cells at the time of infection/ 100) × dilution* *Multiplicity of infection (moi) is the ratio of infectious particles to target cells*. **Transduction of Human CD 34 + Cells** 1. Seed CD 34 + CB cells in CellGro medium at a density of 5 × 10 e 4 cells/well in 48 -well plates. Transduce with fresh lentiviral vector supernatant at an moi of 20 or 4. Incubate for 24 h. - Wash the transduced cells and resuspend in CellGro medium. Incubate for 48 h. Determine transduction efficiency by analyzing enhanced GFP expression by flow cytometry after immunolabeling the cells with an anti-hCD 34 -PE antibody. **NOD/SCID Repopulating Assay** 1. After a 24 -h (moi of 4) transduction with TPOHA-, SCFSUx-displaying lentiviral vectors, inject CD 34 + CB cells into the tail veins of sublethally irradiated (3. 5 Gy) NOD/SCID mice without in vivo administration of cytokines. - Harvest the bone marrow from femurs 6 - 8 wk after transplantation. - Use three-color flow cytometry to detect GFP+ human cells of various lineages in the NOD/SCID bone marrow using anti-hCD 45 -CyChrome and anti-hCD 19 -PE, anti-hCD 14 -PE, anti-hCD 13 -PE, and anti-hCD 34 -PE antibodies. In all cases, use corresponding PE-conjugated mouse IgG controls to evaluate specific labeling. ### REFERENCES 1.
