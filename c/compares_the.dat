5|$|Coleman has {{speculated that}} modern-day {{prosperity}} theology borrows heavily from the New Thought movement, though {{he admits that}} the connection is sometimes unclear. Jenkins notes that critics draw a parallel between prosperity theology and the cargo cult phenomenon. While citing the popularity of prosperity theology in agrarian African communities, he argues that it can also bear similarities to traditional African religious rituals. J. Matthew Wilson of Southern Methodist University <b>compares</b> <b>the</b> movement to Black theology owing to its focus on uplifting oppressed groups, though he notes that it differs in its concentration on individual success rather than corporate political change.|$|E
5|$|Comics {{historian}} Peter Sanderson <b>compares</b> <b>the</b> 1960s DC {{to a large}} Hollywood studio, {{and argues}} that after having reinvented the superhero archetype, DC by {{the latter part of}} the decade was suffering from a creative drought. The audience for comics was no longer just children, and Sanderson sees the 1960s Marvel as the comic equivalent of the French New Wave, developing new methods of storytelling that drew in and retained readers who were in their teens and older and thus influencing the comics writers and artists of the future.|$|E

5|$|In {{computer}} science, binary search, {{also known}} as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds {{the position of a}} target value within a sorted array. Binary search <b>compares</b> <b>the</b> target value to the middle element of the array; if they are unequal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half until it is successful. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.|$|E
5|$|In his Poetics, Aristotle {{points to}} the ″voice of the shuttle″ in Sophocles′ tragedy Tereus {{as an example of}} a poetic device that aids in the ″recognition″—the change from ignorance to knowledge—of what has {{happened}} earlier in the plot. Such a device, according to Aristotle, is ″contrived″ by the poet, and thus is ″inartistic.″. The connection between the nightingale's song and poetry is evoked by Aristophanes in his comedy The Birds and in the poetry of Callimachus. Roman poet Virgil <b>compares</b> <b>the</b> mourning of Orpheus for Eurydice to the “lament of the nightingale”.|$|E
