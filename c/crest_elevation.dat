40|$|Submerged {{structures}} are frequently used in coastal engineering applications, such as tunnel and pipeline protection works, breakwaters, and artificial reefs. Although {{a significant number}} of research works have focused on low-crested structures, there is far less research into deeply submerged structures. In most research, lightly-sloped, uniform cross-sectioned submerged structures with specific <b>crest</b> <b>elevations</b> are considered. The present thesis deals with the three-dimensional physical and numerical modelling of the interaction of irregular waves with a large-scale three-dimensional submerged structure. It aims to advance the understanding of the structure's influence on the irregular wave field, the wave-induced velocities along the structure crest, and the wave-induced currents. The ability of a nonlinear Boussinesq wave model to simulate these processes is also investigated and assessed. Analysis was performed on a multitude of data, including [...] -but not limited to [...] -wave heights, wave periods, wave energy spectra, energy transfer functions, reflection analyses, and wave-induced velocities.

40|$|Coastal foredunes form along sandy, low-sloped coastlines {{and range}} in shape from {{continuous}} dune ridges to hummocky features, which {{are characterized by}} alongshore-variable dune <b>crest</b> <b>elevations.</b> Initially scattered dune-building plants and species that grow slowly in the lateral direction have been implicated {{as a cause of}} foredune hummockiness. Our goal in this work is to explore how the initial configuration of vegetation and vegetation growth characteristics control the development of hummocky coastal dunes including the maximum hummockiness of a given dune field. We find that given sufficient time and absent external forcing, hummocky foredunes coalesce to form continuous dune ridges. Model results yield a predictive rule for the timescale of coalescing and the height of the coalesced dune that depends on initial plant dispersal and two parameters that control the lateral and vertical growth of vegetation, respectively. Our findings agree with previous observational and conceptual work – whether or not hummockiness will be maintained depends on the timescale of coalescing relative to the recurrence interval of high-water events that reset dune building in low areas between hummocks. Additionally, our model reproduces the observed tendency for foredunes to be hummocky along the southeast coast of the US where lateral vegetation growth rates are slower and thus coalescing times are likely longer...|$|R

The Blue Hills Felsenmeer valley contains {{a high concentration of}} angular quartzite boulders. The valley has a small modern water-catchment area that heads at an elevation of 1456 ft. based on LiDAR data. Cahow (no date) proposed the valley was cut by Chippewa Lobe meltwater during the late Chippewa Phase of the late Wisconsin Glaciation. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine if the Chippewa Lobe ice surface was sufficiently high to supply meltwater to erode the valley. We mapped the maximum extent of the Chippewa Moraine using domestic well logs, the Rusk County soil survey, and aerial photographs. Field observations verified the ice-margin position marked by chaotic hummocks, kettles, and ice-walled-lake plains. Hummock-crest elevations were measured within 2 km of the former ice-margin position near the felsenmeer valley head. Clark (1992) reports that this provides a minimum ice-surface elevation estimate within 30 - 100 ft of the actual value. Hummock <b>crest</b> <b>elevations</b> between 1400 - 1410 ft show that the ice surface was within 56 ft of the valley-head threshold. Thus, meltwater from the late Chippewa Phase of the late Wisconsin Glaciation could have eroded the valley. University of Wisconsin [...] Eau Claire Office of Research and Sponsored Programs...|$|R
