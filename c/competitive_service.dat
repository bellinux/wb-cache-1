In the United States there is [...] "very little statutory, common law, and case law establishing employment discrimination based upon sexual orientation as a legal wrong." [...] Some exceptions and alternative legal strategies are available. President Bill Clinton's Executive Order 13087 (1998) prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation in the <b>competitive</b> <b>service</b> of the federal civilian workforce, and federal non-civil service employees may have recourse under the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution.

2500|$|The T44 {{participated in}} a <b>competitive</b> <b>service</b> rifle {{competition}} conducted by the Infantry Board at Fort Benning, Georgia against the Springfield T47 (a modified T25) and the T48, a variant of Fabrique Nationale's FN FAL (from [...] "Fusil Automatique Leger", French for [...] "light automatic rifle"). [...] The T47, which {{did not have a}} bolt roller and performed worse in dust and cold weather tests than both the T44 and the T48, was dropped from consideration in 1953. [...] During 1952–53, testing proved the T48 and the T44 roughly comparable in performance, with the T48 holding an advantage in ease of field stripping and dust resistance, as well as a longer product development lead time. [...] A Newsweek article in July 1953 hinted that the T48/FAL might be selected over the T44. [...] During the winter of 1953–54, both rifles competed in the winter rifle trials at U.S. Army facilities in the Arctic. [...] Springfield Armory engineers, anxious to ensure the selection of the T44, had been specially preparing and modifying the test T44 rifles for weeks with the aid of the armory's cold chamber, including redesign of the T44 gas regulator and custom modifications to magazines and other parts to reduce friction and seizing in extreme cold. [...] The T48 rifles received no such special preparation, and in the continued cold weather testing began to experience sluggish gas system functioning, aggravated by the T48's close-fitting surfaces between bolt and carrier, and carrier and receiver. [...] FN engineers opened the gas ports in an attempt to improve functioning, but this caused early/violent extraction and broken parts {{as a result of the}} increased pressures. [...] As a result, the T44 was ranked superior in cold weather operation to the T48. [...] The Arctic Test Board report made it clear that the T48 needed improvement and that the U.S. would not adopt the T48 until it had successfully completed another round of Arctic tests the following winter.|$|E

A toolkit implementing our framework has been developed as an Eclipse Rich Client Platform (RCP). Our initial evaluation has shown that our framework is ef-fective in identifying services from an object-oriented de-sign and migrating it to a service-oriented architecture. ...|$|R
