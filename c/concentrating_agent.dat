40|$|Abstract: We {{consider}} price-fee {{competition in}} bilateral oligopolies with perfectly-divisible goods, non-expandable infrastructures, <b>concentrated</b> <b>agents</b> on both sides, and constant marginal costs. We define and characterize stable market outcomes. Buyers exclusively {{trade with the}} supplier with whom they achieve maximal bilateral joint welfare. Prices equal marginal costs. Threats to switch suppliers set maximal fees. These also arise from a negotiation model that extends price competition. Competition in both prices and fees necessarily emerges. It improves welfare compared to price competition, but consumer surpluses do not increase. The minimal infrastructure achieving maximal aggregate welfare differs {{from the one that}} protects buyers most. ...|$|R
2500|$|Nanoparticles are 1–1000 {{nanometer}} (nm) sized {{particles that}} can promote tumor selectivity and aid in delivering low-solubility drugs. Nanoparticles can be targeted passively or actively. Passive targeting exploits {{the difference between}} tumor blood vessels and normal blood vessels. Blood vessels in tumors are [...] "leaky" [...] because they have gaps from 200–2000nm, which allow nanoparticles to escape into the tumor. Active targeting uses biological molecules (antibodies, proteins, DNA and receptor ligands) to preferentially target the nanoparticles to the tumor cells. There are many types of nanoparticle delivery systems, such as silica, polymers, liposomes and magnetic particles. Nanoparticles made of magnetic material {{can also be used}} to <b>concentrate</b> <b>agents</b> at tumor sites using an externally applied magnetic field.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Gadobenate dimeglumine {{has proved}} {{advantageous}} {{compared with other}} gadolinium-based contrast agents for contrast-enhanced brain MR imaging. Gadobutrol is a more highly <b>concentrated</b> <b>agent</b> (1. 0 mol/L). This study intraindividually compared 0. 1 -mmol/kg doses of these agents for qualitative and quantitative evaluation of brain tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult patients with suspected or known brain tumors underwent 2 identical MR imaging examinations at 1. 5 T, 1 with gadobenate dimeglumine {{and the other with}} gadobutrol, both at a dose of 0. 1 -mmol/kg body weight. The agents were injected in randomized order separated by 3 – 14 days. Imaging sequences and acquisition timing were identical for the 2 examina-tions. Three blinded readers evaluated images qualitatively for diagnostic information (lesion extent, delineation, morphology, enhancement, global preference) and quantitatively for CNR and LBR. RESULTS: One hundred fourteen of 123 enrolled patients successfully underwent both examinations. Final diagnoses were intra-axial tumors, metastases, extra-axial tumors, “other ” tumors, and “nontu-mor ” (49, 46, 8, 7, and 4 subjects, respectively). Readers 1, 2, and 3 demonstrated preference for gadobenate dimeglumine in 46 (40. 7 %), 54 (47. 4 %), and 49 (43. 0 %) patients, respectively, compared with 6, 7, and 7 patients for gadobutrol (P. 0001, all readers).

40|$|Introduction: The bond {{strength}} of dentin bleached with high <b>concentrated</b> <b>agents</b> can be reestablished if the appropriate restorative material is selected. Objective: The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the influence of bleaching agents and adhesive system on {{bond strength}} of restorative material to intracoronary dentin. Material and methods: 60 fragments of intracoronary dentin (25 mm 2) were embedded in acrylic resin and divided into 3 groups (n = 10) : GI – not bleached (control), GII – 35 % hydrogen peroxide (35 HP), GIII – 38 % hydrogen peroxide (38 HP). The gel was applied for 10 min onto the dentin surface. This protocol was repeated three times at a single session. After 14 days, the groups were divided into subgroups according to the adhesive system used in the restoration: A – Self-etching (Clearfil SE Bond) and B – Total etching (Single Bond 2). The fragments were restored with Z 100 Filtek resin using a bipartite matrix. After 24 h, the specimens were subjected to shear bond strength test. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Tukey test (p < 0. 05). Results: The group bleached with 38 HP(6. 02 ± 3. 95) had the highest bond strength to dentin, followed by 35 HP (5. 36 ± 3. 54), and control group (3. 11 ± 2. 71) (p < 0. 05), although without statistically significant differences.

40|$|A {{major goal}} of {{molecular}} medicine is to target imaging agents or therapeutic compounds {{to a single}} organ. Targeting imaging agents to a single organ could facilitate the high-resolution, in vivo imaging of molecular events.

By targeting and <b>concentrating</b> imaging <b>agents</b> or therapeutics to the lungs, deleterious side effects can be avoided with greater efficacy at much lower dosages.

In this work, we utilized polymeric magnetic nanocapsules (m-NCs) for magnetic targeting in tumors and dynamically visualized them within blood vessels and tumor tissues before, during and after magnetic field exposure using fibered confocal fluorescence microscopy (FCFM). Our results suggested that the distribution of m-NCs within tumor vasculature changed dramatically, but in a reversible way, upon application and removal of a magnetic field. The m-NCs were concentrated and stayed as clusters near a blood vessel wall when tumors were exposed to a magnetic field but without rupturing the blood vessel.

Much of the success in the treatment of cachexia has come from agents capable of blocking protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway.
