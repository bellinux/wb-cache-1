Allied landings around Bordeaux may also have seemed implausible because it was beyond air cover from the UK and lacked the normal physical elements (such as naval activities and dummy landing craft) associated with an invasion.|$|E
25|$|The 1990 story Who shot Jake McKinnon? {{was one of}} {{the biggest}} storylines the show ever told. After his split from Marley, Jake threw <b>caution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wind and began scheming his way through Bay City. He blackmailed Iris after she bribed him to prove Paulina was not Mac's daughter, blackmailed Paulina with fake proof that Mac was not her father, and slept with his former mother-in-law, Donna. Marley and Jake {{reconciled}} once again, but then she found out that he was in the midst of an affair with Paulina. When Marley dumped Jake, he became enraged and raped her. He was later shot by a mystery assailant.|$|E

Throwing <b>caution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wind, Pietersen launched himself into his natural game, taking 21 runs off seven deliveries before finally being out caught by Damien Martyn, a splendid catch just metres off the ropes, as England looked to subside for 130. However, in yet another twist, Simon Jones and Harmison fought back with some streaky accumulation, pairing up for 33 to reduce Australia's lead to 35 runs. England also got a good start fielding, Pietersen having a flat throw at the stumps to run out Langer for 6, but Hayden and Ricky Ponting rebuilt well.|$|E

After running a laboratory at temporary sites near Friday Harbor for several years, Kincaid personally petitioned for the transfer to the university of the 484-acre Point Caution site (an area of San Juan Island that had been set aside as a military reserve {{to be used in the}} event of war with the United Kingdom).

500|$|Along with {{introducing}} the band's new sound, the song opens the album as {{a statement of}} intent. Lyrically, new anticipations and appetites are suggested ("I'm ready for what's next"), as is a willingness to throw <b>caution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wind and take risks ("I'm ready {{to let go of}} the steering wheel"). Some of the lyrics, particularly those in the bridge before the final chorus, use the eponymous subway station as a metaphor for time: [...] "Time is a train / Makes the future the past / Leaves you standing in the station / Your face pressed up against the glass". Bono cites the enjoyment of his first child born in 1989 as a major influence on Achtung Baby, as was his wife's second pregnancy during the album's 1991 recording. Bono says babies influenced the lines from the first verse, [...] "I'm ready to say I'm glad to be alive / I'm ready, I'm ready for the push".|$|E
500|$|The talisman connects these precepts to {{the theory}} of vitalism; it {{physically}} represents the life force of its owner, and is reduced with each exercise of the will. The shopkeeper tries to warn Valentin that the wisest path lies not in exercising his will or securing power, but in developing the mind. [...] "What is folly", he asks Valentin, [...] "if not an excess of will and power?" [...] Overcome with the possibilities offered by the skin, however, the young man throws <b>caution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wind and embraces his desire. Upon grabbing the talisman, he declares: [...] "I want to live with excess." [...] Only when his life force is nearly depleted does he recognize his mistake: [...] "It suddenly struck him that the possession of power, no matter how enormous, did not bring with it the knowledge of how to use it... had had everything in his power, and he had done nothing." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{location}} of {{the start of the}} race was moved to approximately [...] upstream of Putney Bridge in order to reduce interruptions to the race from steamers. [...] Indeed, both boat club presidents had issued a <b>caution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> steamer captains, indicating that the race would be conducted on the ebb tide should any interruption take place which would risk the steamers becoming grounded at Mortlake. The finish was moved the corresponding distance upstream to maintain the traditional length of the race. Oxford rowed in the same boat as the previous race, which was constructed by J. and S. Salter while Cambridge utilised a new vessel built for them by Taylor of Newcastle. [...] Oxford were coached by George Morrison who had rowed in the 1859, 1860 and 1861 races and was non-rowing president for the 1862 race. The race was umpired by Joseph William Chitty who had rowed for Oxford twice in 1849 (in the March and December races) and the 1852 race, while the starter was Edward Searle.|$|E

500|$|Creator Shonda Rhimes {{compared}} {{what she}} deemed the two [...] "most iconic {{moments of the}} season", describing how the season begins with Izzie lying in the prom dress on the bathroom, and ends with Cristina standing motionless in her wedding dress. Cast member Eric Dane described the impact his first scene in the season had on him, stating {{that it was a}} spectacular entrance: [...] "It was a brand new towel, which had a hard time staying together. So every time I put it together and let my hands go, it was almost like throwing <b>caution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wind." [...] Cast member Sara Ramirez noted {{that one of the most}} significant scene in the season was when Izzie and George [...] "have this beautiful moment when neither of them speaks, but they say so much and it was just so rich", describing how their interaction during the scene determined everything that would be developed for their arc later. Betsy Beers, however, noted that the most [...] "powerful" [...] scene in the season saw Cristina Yang and Preston Burke in the on-call room, talking about the future of their relationship: [...] "It's fascinating to see how their entire relationship changes and almost disintegrates in this one exchange". Beers and Rhimes expressed their desire to introduce Patrick Dempsey's passion of car racing in the series, although this ultimately did not occur during the season. [...] "Patrick loved it. He's always driving something new, always trying something out", stated the series creator, regarding Dempsey's response to the storyline.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{was a clear}} {{favourite}} to win the match, {{which took}} place on 17 January 1791 and attracted even more spectators than had been present for the Perrins fight. He had Joe Ward as his second and Mendoza as his bottle holder, with those roles for Bryan being filled by Warr and Humphries. The brutality of the initial fighting was shared by both men. Johnson's nerve failed him, as did his command of the techniques that had served him well. O'Hara describes that he fought [...] "like a wild man" [...] and, throwing <b>caution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wind, broke a metacarpal in his middle finger after the momentum created by throwing a wild punch caused him to crash into the ring rail {{and then to the}} floor. This was the turning point, and O'Hara describes the situation as, [...] "Frightfully beaten, his fists useless, his eyes closed, bathed in blood, and without the chance even of turning the tide with a lucky punch, he refuses to surrender." [...] He had to resort to shifting once more and eventually to wrestling with the hair of Bryan, which generated much disapprobation among the crowd. Eventually Bryan forced Johnson to the floor and beat him unconscious. Johnson had lost the fight, and his status as champion, in 21minutes. Egan speculated that Johnson's change in style, evident from the outset of the fight might have been due to either genuine concern about Bryan's abilities or from his gambling problems; either way, [...] "there was a miserable falling off in him altogether!" ...|$|E
500|$|Slant Magazine writer Sal Cinquemani {{compared}} the album unfavorably to In the Zone, saying that although Blackout [...] "scores well, and its hotness quotient is remarkably high, [...] isn't {{much of a}} step forward for Britney following 2003's surprisingly strong In the Zone, for which she received a writing credit on {{a majority of the}} songs (as opposed to a scant three here)." [...] Andy Battaglia of The A.V. Club said Blackout [...] "counts both as a significant event and as a disquieting aberration that couldn't be more mysteriously manufactured or bizarrely ill-timed" [...] in which [...] "every song counts as markedly progressive and strange." [...] Alexis Petridis from The Guardian called it [...] "a bold, exciting album: the question is whether anyone will be able to hear its contents over the deafening roar of tittle-tattle." [...] He elaborated that when faced with a public image in freefall, an artist has two options: making music [...] "that harks back to your golden, pre-tailspin days" [...] to [...] "underlin your complete normality" [...] or [...] "to throw <b>caution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wind: given your waning fortunes, what's the harm in taking a few musical risks?" [...] Petridis commented that Spears opted for the latter and the results were [...] "largely fantastic." [...] Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times said, [...] "The electronic beats and bass lines are as thick as Ms. Spears's voice is thin, and as the album title suggests, the general mood is bracingly unapologetic." [...] Sanneh added that said Spears became a spectral presence in her own album, explaining that when compared to her previous records, [...] " [...] cuts a startlingly low profile on Blackout [...] Even when she was being marketed as a clean-cut ex-Mouseketeer, and even when she was touring the country with a microphone that functioned largely as a prop, something about her was intense." [...] Peter Robinson of The Observer stated that Spears [...] "delivered the best album of her career, raising the bar for modern pop music with an incendiary mix of Timbaland's Shock Value and her own back catalogue." [...] The Phoenixs Ellee Dean said the album [...] "may be more a tribute to the skills of the A-list producers who guided her through the disc than to any of her own talents. But at least she was smart enough to accept that guidance." [...] In his consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau gave the album a B+ and said that [...] "From 'Gimme More's 'It's Britney bitch' hiya to 'Piece of Me's single-of-the-year sonics, from 'Ooh Ooh Baby's 'feel you deep inside' to 'Perfect Lover's 'touch me there', this album is pure, juicy, plastic get-naked." [...] Blackout was ranked by Rolling Stone at number fifty on their list of the 100 Best Albums of 2007. The album topped Billboards Reader's Choice poll as the best album of the year.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Screams of Abel webzine, former Antestor member Morten Mageroy reacted with <b>caution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> proliferation of unblack bands: [...] "I really hope that people (who play Christian black metal) {{know what they are}} doing.

I am not saying that I know that these musicians are going to mess their lives up, but I have seen it happen to some people and it frightens me very much." [...] Mageroy, however, defends the unblack metal bands' intentions: [...] "A lot of Christian bands have done amazing things being led by God. I know that God is using many types of communication, and it is important that Christians is [...] present in every field, in every genre, privately and in work. God might just as well use heavy metal to bring salvation to people." ...|$|E

Spin gave the album a 7/10, saying [...] "Thing is, dubstep's slithering textures actually suit Davis' demented croon". Henry Northmore from The List gave the album a rating of 4/5 saying that [...] "the purists (both metal and dubstep) will probably hate it, {{but if you are}} willing to have your brain assaulted from every direction by a new Frankensteinian metal/beats hybrid, you’ll find an album packed with pure adrenaline".
