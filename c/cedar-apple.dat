40|$|Seven {{species of}} the genus Gymnosporangium occur in Iowa, but only G. juniperi-virginianae, causing <b>cedar-apple</b> rust, and G. globosum, causing {{hawthorn}} rust, are common. The latter is of little economic importance. The epidemic of <b>cedar-apple</b> rust in 1928 caused an estimated loss of 200, 000 in Iowa. Six to seven hours were required to produce abundant sporulation from air dry galls of G. juniperi-virginianae {{regardless of whether the}} period of soaking was 30 or 180 minutes. Newly-matured aecidiospores of G. juniperi-virginianae germinated to the extent of 54 percent in July. A lot was divided and the percentage of germination in the portion refrigerated at 5 to 13 °C. increased rapidly for at least 22 days, while that in the portion held at room temperature for the same interval dropped to zero. At Shenandoah the interval between infection and first opening of aecidia of <b>cedar-apple</b> rust on Bechtel 2 ̆ 7 s flowering crab was about 72 days. That for hawthorn rust on Crataegus mollis was about 81 days. Seedlings of red cedar were successfully inoculated using aecidiospores of G. juniperi-virginianae. Large differences in the number of galls on trees which had received similar treatments suggested a variation in disease resistance. The only appreciable germination of aecidiospores of G. globosum was obtained in November from diseased hawthorn leaves which had fallen to the ground and others which were refrigerated 41 days at 5 °C. Differences in the degree of maturity reached by the cedar rusts are utilized in defining the relative susceptibility of their aecidial hosts. The percentage of leaf area covered by lesions of <b>cedar-apple</b> rust is recorded for 138 varieties of apples and 28 varieties of crabapples which were growing in nursery rows at Shenandoah during the years, 1928 to 1930. Aecidiospores were matured on only 30 percent of these hosts. The percentage of infected apple leaves seemed to vary roughly as the percentage. of diseased leaf area, but leafiness was not related to the amount of rust infection. These lines of evidence suggest that the period of susceptibility in leaves of susceptible varieties may be longer than that of resistant ones. Artificial inoculations show that Tolman and York Imperial varieties of apple are very susceptible to the strain of G. juniperi-virginianae from Morgantown, W. Va., but are resistant to other strains from Ames and Shenandoah, Iowa; Manhattan, Kan., and Cochrane,,Vis. The results indicate the presence of physiologic specialization within the species. There is little evidence that the susceptibility of trees of one variety of apple may vary in different sections of the country. None of the observed varieties of apple or crabapple seem to be susceptible to G. globosum, in Iowa...|$|E
40|$|A {{systematic}} {{study of}} the storage diseases of apples includes the consideration of two general groups: (a) the functional, and (b) the parasitic diseases. Although most kinds of parasitic diseases are seldom found on good grades of apples, occasionally some of these escape inspection and develop considerably on ripe, fruit in storage. The fruit grower who is concerned with producing sound fruit is familiar with such parasitic diseases as apple scab, apple blotch and <b>cedar-apple</b> rust. The fruit dealer, storage operator and consumer, on the other hand, more frequently {{come in contact with}} the functional diseases such as Jonathan spot, apple scald, bitter pit and breakdown...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cedar-apple</b> rust (Gymnosporangium yamadai Miyabe) is a {{fungal disease}} that causes {{substantial}} injury to apple trees {{and results in}} fruit with reduced size and quality and a lower commercial value. The molecular mechanisms underlying the primary and secondary metabolic effects of rust spots on the leaves of Malus apple cultivars are poorly understood. Using HPLC, {{we found that the}} contents of flavonoid compounds, especially anthocyanin and catechin, were significantly increased in rust-infected symptomatic tissue (RIT). The expression levels of structural genes and MYB transcription factors related to flavonoid biosynthesis were one- to seven-fold higher in the RIT. Among these genes, CHS, DFR, ANS, FLS and MYB 10 showed more than a 10 -fold increase, suggesting that these genes were expressed at significantly higher levels in the RIT. Hormone concentration assays showed that the levels of abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene (ETH), jasmonate (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) were higher in the RIT and were consistent with the expression levels of McNCED, McACS, McLOX and McNPR 1, respectively. Our study explored the complicated crosstalk of the signal transduction pathways of ABA, ETH, JA and SA; the primary metabolism of glucose, sucrose, fructose and sorbitol; and the secondary metabolism of flavonoids involved in the rust resistance of Malus crabapple leaves...|$|E
