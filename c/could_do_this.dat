5|$|The {{number of}} wage rates and wage scales was {{drastically}} reduced; {{this not only}} cut bureaucracy, but also ensured that workers would be more eager {{to take on a}} wider range of tasks. Time workers, for example, would be paid the same regardless of which task they carried out during their shift. This allowed managers to better distribute labour and reduce the frequency of bottlenecks occurring in production. They <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> because workers would be paid a similar rate no matter what they undertook, so it became easier to move workers between tasks.|$|E
5|$|Potter, however, did {{not feel}} he fitted into this {{increasingly}} experimental sound the band was developing and tended {{to wait until the}} others had worked out their parts during rehearsals, adding his bass lines on top at the last minute. After recording three tracks of their third album, H to He, Who Am the Only One (December 1970), he decided to quit the band. His last gig was on 9 August at the 1970 Plumpton Festival. The remaining members auditioned Dave Anderson, roadie for Brinsley Schwarz and friend of the band, but after a week's rehearsal found that things weren't working out musically. Banton, meanwhile, had become influenced by Vincent Crane's work in Atomic Rooster, where Crane played the bass lines on a Hammond organ's bass pedals and suggested that he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> as well. With just days to go before the next gig, they tried rehearsing as a four-piece, and it was successful. Banton later played bass guitar on certain songs, having already learned the instrument in the mid-1960s, and Hammill expanded his instrumental capabilities on stage to cover piano and keyboards as well as guitar. Jackson modified his saxophones to be completely electric, as opposed to simply being amplified through a microphone, and combined the sound with a wah-wah pedal and an octave divider.|$|E
5|$|Several units lost crucially needed {{supply lines}} {{in the middle of}} their offensives, {{particularly}} when crossing the Naktong River which had few stable bridges remaining. The NK 3rd Division stopped receiving food and ammunition supply as it pushed on Taegu in mid-August, forcing one of its regiments to withdraw from the captured Triangulation Hill. At Naktong Bulge, the NK 4th Division was able to establish a raft system for moving supplies across the river, but it still suffered serious food, ammunition, weapon, and equipment shortages after its August 5 crossing. It was also eventually turned back due to supply problems. The situation was most dire for units in the east, where rugged and mountainous terrain already posed a logistical challenge. The NK 5th Division and NK 12th Division attacking P'ohang-dong stopped receiving all food and ammunition supply between August 12 and August 20, a key factor in their defeat there. In some instances, desperate North Korean units forced South Korean populations to carry their supplies for them. North Korean units had advanced too far too quickly, and their logistical system, stretched beyond its limit, collapsed at a key point in the war. Morale remained high for many units despite the lack of supplies. North Korean units instead turned to foraging for what they could find in the countryside or raiding UN supplies. Small guerrilla units, such as the NK 766th Infantry Regiment, <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> effectively.|$|E

He concluded a treaty with the Frankish mayor of the palace Ragenfrid so that in 716 his armies entered Frankish territory as far as Cologne, where they were victorious in the Battle of Cologne. In this way all lands south of the Rhine became Frisian again. The army returned to the north with much war loot.

25|$|The film follows {{this with}} a {{miscellaneous}} listing of allegations.

It suggests that calls from passengers and crew were faked using sophisticated voice-morphing technology developed by the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico—and that the December 13, 2001 video of Osama Bin Laden claiming responsibility for the attacks was also faked, featuring what appeared to be an overweight lookalike version of Bin Laden. Finally it alleges that of the list of hijackers the government initially released, many were not in the planes and therefore survived September 11, 2001 and may even still be alive.|$|E

500|$|Leng views [...] "Who Can See It" [...] as a [...] "new type of ballad" [...] from Harrison, {{one that}} {{combines}} a [...] "dramatic edge" [...] with rhythmic sophistication. The time signature shifts throughout the composition, from 4/4 to 6/4 and 5/8, with brief portions in 5/4 and 3/4. In Leng's description, the melody features [...] "sweepingly large chromatic intervals", {{beginning with the}} verse's third line – a four-semitone swoop that recalls the ascending melismas commonly used in Indian music.

After brainstorming [...] "Homer the Heretic", they thought of Lisa entering a beauty pageant. They assigned Jeff Martin to write the episode because they assumed he would fill it with songs, like he had done on previous episodes. Martin obliged, and wrote the episode and its music. He also based the episode on some of his own experiences, such as the scene where Lisa has a caricature of herself drawn. According to Jeff Martin, [...] "I'm not sure if we <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> episode today. People had a more innocent view of child beauty pageants before JonBenet Ramsey." ...|$|E
500|$|Since {{several members}} of the team enjoyed racing games and had also worked on Diddy Kong Racing, they decided to include the futuristic Ant racing {{featured}} in the campaign and the top-down arcade racing games in the multiplayer.

According to Mountain, [...] "we wanted to deliver the same experience to all players and were confident that we <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> using the standard 4MB of RAM on the console." [...] This led to some confusion as the box cover for the original release stated that it did support such a feature.

500|$|... is {{the third}} member of Taka. His clan {{has the ability to}} use senjutsu, but due to the severe amount of natural energy they absorb they are prone to fits of extreme violence, with {{additional}} side effects being that they can revert to a childlike form if they use it the wrong way. Because of this, in childhood, Jugo was an outcast, eventually finding solace in Kimimaro whom he saw as an older sibling. After meeting Sasuke, he tried to refuse being part of Taka and used his abilities, but Sasuke managed to calm him down.

500|$|Excited at the prospect, Åkerfeldt agreed without {{consulting}} his bandmates or record label. While his bandmates {{liked the idea}} of recording two separate albums, Åkerfeldt had to convince the label: [...] "I had to lie somewhat... saying that we <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> recording very soon, it won't cost more than a regular single album." [...] With most of the material written, the band rehearsed just once before entering Nacksving Studios in 2002, and again with producer Steven Wilson in Studio Fredman. Under pressure to complete both albums simultaneously, Åkerfeldt said the recording process was [...] "the toughest test of our history." [...] After recording basic tracks, the band moved production to England to first mix the heavy album, Deliverance, with Andy Sneap at Backstage Studios. [...] "Deliverance was so poorly recorded, without any organisation whatsoever," [...] Åkerfeldt claimed, that Sneap [...] "is credited as a 'saviour' in the sleeve, as he surely saved much of the recording." ...|$|E
500|$|Bethe {{took the}} lead {{from the work of}} Hans Kramers, and derived a renormalized non-relativistic quantum {{equation}} for the Lamb shift. The next step was to create a relativistic version. Feynman thought that he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> but when he went back to Bethe with his solution, it did not converge. Feynman carefully worked through the problem again, applying the path integral formulation that he had used in his thesis. Like Bethe, he made the integral finite by applying a cut-off term. The result corresponded to Bethe's version. Feynman presented his work to his peers at the Pocono Conference in 1948. It did not go well. Julian Schwinger gave a long presentation of his work in quantum electrodynamics, and Feynman then offered his version, titled [...] "Alternative Formulation of Quantum Electrodynamics". The unfamiliar Feynman diagrams, used for the first time, puzzled the audience. Feynman failed to get his point across, and Paul Dirac, Edward Teller and Niels Bohr all raised objections.|$|E
