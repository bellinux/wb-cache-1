5|$|Thorpe, {{whose parents}} were both half Caucasian, was raised as an American Indian. His accomplishments {{occurred}} {{during a period of}} severe racial inequality in the United States. It has often been suggested that his medals were stripped because of his ethnicity.* Elfers. pg. 18 While it is difficult to prove this, the public <b>comment</b> <b>at</b> the time largely reflected this view. At the time Thorpe won his gold medals, not all Native Americans were recognized as U.S.citizens. (The U.S.government had wanted them to make concessions to adopt European-American ways to receive such recognition.) Citizenship was not granted to all American Indians until 1924.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of Burford I {{was one of the}} members who {{constituted}} the court. I owe it to my own consistency to declare that the court were then apprized of my objections to the issuing of the writ of habeas corpus. I did not then <b>comment</b> <b>at</b> large on the reasons which influenced my opinion, and the cause was this: The gentleman who argued that cause confined himself strictly to those considerations which ought alone to influence the decisions of this court. No popular observations on the necessity of protecting the citizen from executive oppression, no animated address calculated to enlist the passions or prejudices of an audience in defence of his motion, imposed on me the necessity of vindicating my opinion. I submitted in silent deference to the decision of my brethren.|$|E

5|$|While signing {{modeling}} posters for Jonathan Gold, {{a talent}} agent and professional wrestling promoter, Psaltis jokingly told Gold {{that she would}} be interested in pursuing a career in wrestling. Gold took her <b>comment</b> <b>at</b> face value and later contacted Psaltis, informing her that she was scheduled to appear at a wrestling show in New Jersey. With some trepidation, she went to the show and managed Tony Atlas in his match against Jimmy Snuka. Psaltis made her professional wrestling debut in January 1995. She met her future fiancé Simon Diamond during her time in the independent wrestling promotions. She also met Buddy Landell and Devon Storm, both of whom helped train her. Psaltis spent four years working on the northeastern independent circuit, appearing with promotions such as Maryland Championship Wrestling and the Mid-Eastern Wrestling Federation.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court {{extended}} the standard from Berghuis v. Thompkins in Salinas v. Texas, 570 U.S. ___ (2013), on June 17, 2013, holding that a suspect's silence {{in response to}} a specific question posed during an interview with police when the suspect was not in custody and the suspect had been voluntarily answering other questions during that interview could be used against him in court where he did not explicitly invoke his Fifth Amendment right to silence in response to the specific question. Of the five justices who concluded that the suspect's silence could be used against him in these circumstances, Justices Alito, Roberts and Kennedy concluded that the defendant's Fifth Amendment claim failed because he did not expressly invoke the privilege. The other two Justices, Thomas and Scalia, concluded that the defendant's claim would fail even if he had invoked the privilege, on the theory that the prosecutor's <b>comment</b> <b>at</b> the trial—regarding the defendant's silence {{in response to a}} question during the police interview—did not compel the defendant to give self-incriminating testimony.|$|E

25|$|During a Test {{series against}} South Africa in 2005, Bravo scored his maiden century – 107 before getting out to Mark Boucher – {{in the fourth}} Test in Antigua, but that was overshadowed when he accused South African Graeme Smith of {{directing}} a racist <b>comment</b> <b>at</b> him. At the subsequent hearing no evidence could be found and charges were dropped against Smith, who immediately demanded an apology from Bravo. Bravo, backed by the West Indies Cricket Board, refused {{to do so and}} received a hail of criticism from an indignant South African press while finding support at home as a human rights campaigner.|$|E

The 1958–59 corps formed a considerable body of cricket knowledge; L. N. Bailey, Alex Bannister, Alec Bedser, Bill Bowes, Charles Bray, Brian Chapman, John Clarke, Charles Fortune, Harry Gee, John Kay, Ian Peebles, R. A. Roberts, Frank Rostron, Denys Rowbotham, E. W.

25|$|Healy {{proved an}} able Governor-General, {{possessing}} {{a degree of}} political skill, deep political insight and contacts in Britain that the new Irish Government initially lacked, and had long recommended himself to the Catholic Hierarchy: all-round good credentials for this key symbolic and reconciling position at the centre of public life. He joked once that the government didn't advise him, he advised the government: a <b>comment</b> <b>at</b> a dinner for The Duke of York (the future King George VI) that led to public criticism. However, the waspish Healy still could not help courting further controversy, most notably in a public attack on the new Fianna Fáil and its leader, Éamon de Valera, which led to republican calls for his resignation.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} {{apartheid}} laws were passed in South Africa after 1948, sporting teams going to South Africa had felt {{it necessary to}} exclude non-white players. In 1906, the South Africans objected to the selection of black England international James Peters when he turned out for Devon; but were persuaded to play by officials. Though, when England faced South Africa later in the tour, Peters was not selected. New Zealand rugby teams in particular had done this, and the exclusion of George Nepia and Jimmy Mill from the 1928 All Blacks tour, and the dropping of Ranji Wilson from the New Zealand Army team nine years before that, had attracted little <b>comment</b> <b>at</b> the time. However, in 1960 international criticism of apartheid grew in the wake of The Wind of Change speech and the Sharpeville massacre.|$|E

500|$|During 1897, Dunne {{sometimes}} set {{his sights}} overseas, discussing Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. Dooley noted that while the sun never set on her domains, the original owners did not get to [...] "set" [...] there either, [...] "bein' kept movin' be the polis [...] ". Late that year, Dunne moved to the Chicago Journal as managing editor and Mr. Dooley began to <b>comment</b> <b>at</b> his new venue in early 1898. Dunne had been limited at his old position by Kohlsaat's insistence that his papers support President McKinley's efforts to settle differences with Spain over Cuba short of war. [...] At the Journal, where the journalism was yellow and shrill appeals for war the norm, Dunne labored under no such inhibitions. He had always turned away praise of the Dooley pieces from those aware of his authorship, wishing {{to be known as}} a serious writer. Because of the dialect, the Dooley columns were more difficult for him than writing editorials and columns in plain English. He had ended his last Dooley piece at the Post with the barkeeper bidding farewell, locking the saloon door (as Dunne put it) [...] "perhaps for the last time", possibly meaning that Dooley was done. Dooley had been depicted as in favor of war against Spain in the Post, and Dunne favored military intervention to free Cuba. [...] On February 19, 1898, four days after the USS Maine sank in Havana harbor, Dunne restored Dooley to his arsenal against the Spanish. [...] Fanning wrote of Mr. Dooley's subsequent howls for war: [...] "bandoning his usual stance as a cool and neutral ironist, Mr. Dooley becomes one more loud, irrational voice expressing cruelly simplified hatred of Spain and anger at President McKinley. These new pieces mark the low point in the Dooley canon, for in them Dunne shatters the persona that he has built up s had moderated his position, even if the Journal had not. [...] On April 16, Dunne had Dooley paint a mocking portrait of Fitzhugh Lee, the U.S. consul in Havana whose belligerent reports were fueling the drive to war, in a column printed while the Journal editorial page was praising Lee. But the real breakthrough was after the Battle of Manila Bay on May 1. That a battle had taken place was known, but as the American commander, Admiral George Dewey, was believed to have severed the cable lines, no word came to the United States, and the nation waited in suspense, fearing defeat. [...] Then, news that Dewey had destroyed the dilapidated Spanish fleet arrived, but the details, and the fate of Dewey and his ships and men, were unknown. Before word came from Dewey that he had not lost a ship or man appeared the May 7 Mr. Dooley piece, [...] "On His Cousin George", that is the admiral, for [...] "Dewey or Dooley, 'tis all th' same". Dooley predicted that [...] "he'll write home and say he's got the islands; and he'll turn them over to the government and go back to his ship, and Mark Hanna'll organize the Philippine Islands Jute and Cider Company, and the revolutionists'll wish they hadn't. That's what'll happen. Mark my word." ...|$|E
