5|$|In {{contrast}} to the French tradition, the Natchez and their conflicts with the French have been mostly forgotten in <b>contemporary</b> <b>American</b> historiography. Historian Gordon Sayre attributes this {{to the fact that}} both the French and the Natchez were defeated in colonial wars before the birth of the United States.|$|E

5|$|The {{latter part}} of the 20th century saw the rise of multi-volume vampire epics. The first of these was Gothic romance writer Marilyn Ross's Barnabas Collins series (1966–71), loosely based on the <b>contemporary</b> <b>American</b> TV series Dark Shadows. It also set the trend for seeing vampires as poetic tragic heroes rather than as the more {{traditional}} embodiment of evil. This formula was followed in novelist Anne Rice's highly popular and influential Vampire Chronicles (1976–2003).|$|E
5|$|Little Annie Fanny is a comics {{series by}} Harvey Kurtzman and Will Elder. It {{appeared}} in 107 two- to seven-page episodes in Playboy magazine from October 1962 to September 1988. Little Annie Fanny is a humorous satire of <b>contemporary</b> <b>American</b> {{society and its}} sexual mores. Annie Fanny, the title character, is a statuesque, buxom young blonde woman who innocently finds herself nude in every episode. The series is notable for its painted, luminous color artwork and for being the first full-scale, multi-page comics feature in a major American publication.|$|E
40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{identify}} educational issues faced by <b>contemporary</b> African <b>American</b> Students that are different or similar (Collins, 2003) to those faced by Black Americans of the 1954 Brown (Brown v. Board of Education, 1954) era. This study seeks to reveal through autobiographical life story (Linde, 1993), autoethnography (Denzin, 1997), and autobiography (Smith, 1998) the stories of Black parents of <b>contemporary</b> African <b>American</b> students in an urban suburban context. This study was guided by five questions: (1) Given the social, political and educational climate experienced by Black Americans during the 1954 era, what are the beliefs, assumptions and intentions underlying the educational experiences of the <b>contemporary</b> African <b>American</b> student? (2) How have the goals of Brown been achieved by <b>contemporary</b> African <b>American</b> students? (3) How is the contemporary or post-modern African American student viewed by society? (4) Are Brown’s goals still relevant to <b>contemporary</b> African <b>American</b> students? (5) If the goals are still relevant, what {{still needs to be}} done to achieve Brown’s goals...|$|R

5|$|In the White House, Clinton placed donated {{handicrafts}} of <b>contemporary</b> <b>American</b> artisans, such as {{pottery and}} glassware, on rotating {{display in the}} state rooms. She oversaw {{the restoration of the}} Blue Room to be historically authentic to the period of James Monroe and the Map Room to how it looked during World War II. Working with Arkansas interior decorator Kaki Hockersmith over an eight-year period, she oversaw extensive, privately funded redecoration efforts around the building, often trying to make it look brighter. These included changing the look of the Treaty Room, a presidential study, to along 19th century lines. Overall the redecoration brought mixed notices, with Victorian furnishings for the Lincoln Sitting Room being criticized the most. Clinton hosted many large-scale events at the White House, including a state dinner for visiting Chinese dignitaries, a New Year's Eve celebration {{at the turn of the}} 21st century and a state dinner honoring the bicentennial of the White House in November 2000.|$|E
5|$|Kubrick {{attended}} William Howard Taft High School from 1941 to 1945. One of {{his classmates}} was Edith Gormezano, later known as the singer Eydie Gorme. Though he joined the school's photographic club, which permitted him to photograph the school's events in their magazine, he was a mediocre student, with a meager 67 grade average. Introverted and shy, Kubrick had a low attendance record, and often skipped school to watch double-feature films. He graduated in 1945, but his poor grades, combined with the demand for college admissions from soldiers returning from the Second World War, eliminated hope of higher education. Later in life, Kubrick spoke disdainfully of his education and of <b>contemporary</b> <b>American</b> schooling as a whole, maintaining that schools were ineffective in stimulating critical thinking and student interest. His father was disappointed in his son's failure to achieve excellence in school, of which he felt Stanley was fully capable. Jack also encouraged Stanley to read from the former's library at home, {{while at the same}} time permitting Stanley to take up photography as a serious hobby.|$|E
5|$|Wolves in Japan became extinct {{during the}} Meiji {{restoration}} period, an extermination known as ōkami no kujo. The wolf was deemed {{a threat to}} ranching, which the Meiji government promoted at the time, and targeted via a bounty system and a direct chemical extermination campaign inspired by the similar <b>contemporary</b> <b>American</b> campaign. The last Japanese wolf was a male killed on January 23, 1905 near Washikaguchi (now called Higashi Yoshiro). The now extinct Japanese wolves were descended from large Siberian wolves, which colonized the Korean Peninsula and Japan, before it separated from mainland Asia, 20,000 years ago during the Pleistocene. During the Holocene, the Tsugaru Strait widened and isolated Honshu from Hokkaidō, thus causing climatic changes leading to the extinction of most large bodied ungulates inhabiting the archipelago. Japanese wolves likely underwent a process of island dwarfism 7,000–13,000 years ago {{in response to these}} climatological and ecological pressures. C. l. hattai (formerly native to Hokkaidō) was significantly larger than its southern cousin C. l. hodophilax, as it inhabited higher elevations and had access to larger prey, as well as a continuing genetic interaction with dispersing wolves from Siberia.|$|E
