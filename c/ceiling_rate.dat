50|$|The {{recommendations}} of the Sukhmoy Chakravarty Committee on the Review of the Working of the Monetary system, and the Narasimham Committee Report on the Working of the Financial System in India, 1991, The Reserve Bank of India has initiated a series of money market reforms basically directed towards the efficient discharge of its objectives. The bank reduced the <b>ceiling</b> <b>rate</b> on bank advances and on inter-bank call and short-notice money. There {{has been a significant}} lowering of the minimum lending rate of commercial banks and public sector development financial institutions from 18% in 1990-91 to 10.5% in 2005-06.|$|E

The committee also opposed any <b>ceiling</b> <b>rate</b> for non concessional loans and advances. All that would introduce what the Committee had called 'controlled competition' among banks. This was expected to promote better use of credit by borrowers' and prompt them to improve their Credit rating so as to gain more favorable terms from their bankers, and in turn make bankers more cost and profit conscious and also more responsive to the genuine needs and problems of their consumers.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explore the effects of {{interest}} <b>rate</b> <b>ceilings</b> in a small open economy. In order to account for many individuals and lending, a model with heterogenous agents is considered. The investigation is focused on two issues: first, how effective are interest <b>rate</b> <b>ceilings</b> at reducing loans and risk in the economy and at what cost; and second, whether imposing interest rate limits produce any different response of the variables to aggregate shocks in the economy. The results obtained from the model show that interest <b>rate</b> <b>ceilings</b> are effective at reducing high risk debt in the financial system. The cost on consumption of reducing this risk is minimum in the model. The findings for the second issue show that interest <b>rate</b> <b>ceilings</b> make debt more responsive to shocks on the interest rates. In particular, the effect in percentage points of an increase of interest rates could be twice as negative on debt under interest <b>rate</b> <b>ceilings.</b> ...|$|R

The I-16 was slightly more maneuverable than the early Bf 109s and could fight the Messerschmitt Bf 109E, or Emil, on equal terms in turns. Skilled Soviet pilots {{took advantage of the}} Polikarpov's superior horizontal maneuverability and liked it enough to resist the switch to more modern fighters. The German aircraft, however, outclassed its Soviet {{opponent in}} service <b>ceiling,</b> <b>rate</b> of climb, acceleration and, crucially, in horizontal and diving speed, due to better aerodynamics and a more powerful engine. The main versions of the I-16 had a maximum speed of 450-70 km/h (279-91 mph), while the Bf 109E had a maximum speed of 560-70 km/h (347-53 mph), the more streamlined Bf 109F Friedrich could hit 615-630 km/h (372-390plus mph). Superior speed was the decisive factor in a dogfight, so German pilots held the initiative and could decide if they wanted to chase their opponents, could attack them from above and behind and then gain altitude for a new attack. Meanwhile, Polikarpovs could only defend each other by forming a defensive circle or via horizontal maneuverability.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the goals}} of the {{multilateral}} trading system is to enhance the stability and predictability of the environment in which traders operate. Binding tariffs at the WTO reduces the scope for their discretionary use. But, countries have bound tariffs at ceiling levels often substantially above the level of applied tariffs. Therefore, whether the <b>ceiling</b> <b>rate</b> at which countries have committed at the WTO is sufficient to diminish trade policy volatility is an empirical question. Using a recently built database on applied tariffs covering over 100 countries for the period 1996 to 2009, we find evidence that countries do vary tariffs. Most importantly, we find evidence that applied tariffs of tariff lines that are bound {{are more likely to be}} decreased and less likely to be increased, and that this taming effect of the binding decreases with the level of the water (i. e. the gap between bound and applied tariff).

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of {{restrictive}} consumer loan <b>rate</b> <b>ceilings</b> on the provision of and charges assessed by commercial banks for consumer savings and demand deposit services. The study uses data that were collected in four distinct local markets that differed extremely {{with regard to the}} applicable <b>rate</b> <b>ceilings.</b> The 31 banks that provided information for the study represented 88. 6 percent of the banks serving consumers in the four market areas. Because consumers shop for consumer financial services in their relevant local market, an accurate evaluation of the effects of <b>rate</b> <b>ceilings</b> on terms for household demand and savings deposits can be obtained by holding other socio-economic conditions constant and analyzing differences across market areas. 'The results of the study indicate that in Arkansas, where rates on all types of consumer credit were restricted by the <b>rate</b> <b>ceilings</b> during the study period, the service and overdraft charges assessed on demand deposits were significantly higher than those in states with unrestrictive <b>rate</b> <b>ceilings,</b> holding other things constant.

40|$|Spence Hilton’s paper {{provides}} a comprehensive {{overview of the}} Fed’s mechanisms {{for the provision of}} liquidity for both monetary policy and financial system purposes. In the monetary policy function, the Fed uses its powers as the ultimate supplier of liquidity to achieve the proximate target of monetary policy. Essentially, the Fed supplies a level of reserves to achieve the overnight Fed funds target rate, {{the first step in the}} transmission of monetary policy. The paper outlines this process and highlights the current challenges of achieving the target, particularly during periods of market turbulence. Required reserves are no longer sufficient to buffer large unanticipated payment flows, which means that there is greater potential for volatility in the overnight Fed funds rate. This is accentuated by the lack of appropriate price incentives to help ensure that Fed funds trade around target given that the rate is bounded by a floor of zero (with the Fed unable to pay interest until 2011) and by a <b>ceiling</b> <b>rate</b> on the discount rate (where access to the primary credit facility is affected by ‘stigma’) ...|$|E
40|$|Disruption of the {{systemic}} angiogenesis balance to favor enhanced angiogenesis is speculated {{to represent a}} key step {{in the growth of}} tumors. Although a major emphasis has been placed on the increase of angiogenesis stimulators, such as VEGF, on the disruption of the angiogenic balance, the potential role of the physiological levels of endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis on tumor growth is poorly understood. Here, we use three independent lines of mice deficient in tumstatin, endostatin, or thrombospondin- 1 (TSP- 1), to address the role that these endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors play in tumor growth. Our experiments demonstrate that normal physiological levels of these inhibitors serve to retard the growth of tumors, and that their absence leads to enhanced angiogenesis and a 2 - to 3 -fold increase in tumor growth. The tumor-suppressive action of TSP- 1, endostatin, and tumstatin correlates with expression of CD 36 receptor, α 5 β 1 integrin, and αvβ 3 integrin on proliferating endothelial cells, respectively. Moreover, tumors grow 2 -fold faster in the tumstatin/TSP- 1 double-knockout mice, compared with either the tumstatin- or the TSP- 1 -deficient mice, strongly suggesting that <b>ceiling</b> <b>rate</b> of cancer growth is not completely dependent on the genetic defects of cancer cells but also depends on the host-derived tumor microenvironment. Additionally, tumor growth in transgenic mice overproducing endostatin specifically in the endothelial cells (a 1. 6 -fold increase in the circulating levels; mimicking Down's syndrome condition) is 3 -fold slower than the tumor growth in wild-type mice. Collectively, our data suggest that physiological levels of endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis can serve as endothelium-specific tumor suppressors...|$|E

[...] The authors discovered that in the 1980s in the United States, in states that fixed an interest <b>rate</b> <b>ceiling</b> of 18% firms charged a rate only slightly below the ceiling.

Another example is Sen et al. [...] who found that gasoline prices were higher in states that instituted price ceilings. We can give here the example of a supreme court of Pakistan decision regarding fixing of a ceiling price for sugar at PKR45/kg. The result was sugar disappeared from the market due to a cartel of sugar producers and the failure of the Pakistani government to maintain supply even in the stores owned by the Government against the large demand of the sugar. The imported sugar require time to reach the country, and it was not feasible to sell at the rate fixed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan. Eventually the government went for a review petition in the Supreme Court and sought the withdrawal of the earlier decision of the apex court. Eventually fixation of ceiling price was withdrawn and the market equilibrium was achieved between PKR55-60/kg (Supreme Court of Pakistan decision, 2006-2007).|$|R
