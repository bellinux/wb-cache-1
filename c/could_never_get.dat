5|$|Darla's just misunderstood. Her {{intentions}} are pure, they're {{just kind of}} warped. From her perspective—first she has to eat—she just happens to eat people! Second, {{she was in love}} with Angel, and I always viewed Darla as the jilted ex-wife that <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> over being dumped. If you really look at her, you can have sympathy and empathy for her. In the beginning of her life she was a prostitute, Joss and I actually talked about that a lot, that she was probably abused growing up. She did what she needed to do to survive, she just lacked the people skills.|$|E
5|$|In the Cambridgeshire {{over nine}} furlongs on 27 October, St. Gatien, now undefeated in eleven races, started 2/1 {{favourite}} {{in a field}} of twenty-seven. He was prominent throughout the race but <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> on level terms with the filly Plaisanterie who won impressively by two lengths carrying 124 pounds. St. Gatien was involved in a close race for the minor places and finished fifth, just behind Bendigo, Eastern Emperor and Caltha. He had no chance with the winner, but may have been unlucky not to finish second. Two days after losing his unbeaten record, St. Gatien returned to his favoured staying distance in the Jockey Club Cup. He started at odds of 1/8 and won the race very easily, beating Lavaret by fifteen lengths.|$|E
25|$|Being {{a member}} of declining Mughal nobility and old landed aristocracy, he never worked for a livelihood, lived on either royal {{patronage}} of Mughal Emperors, credit or the generosity of his friends. His fame came to him posthumously. He had himself remarked during his lifetime {{that he would be}} recognized by later generations. After the decline of the Mughal Empire {{and the rise of the}} British Raj, despite his many attempts, Ghalib <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> the full pension restored.|$|E

5000|$|The Tricky Gomez {{is based}} on the Manta Ray platform, but it has mini-Humbuckers, called Revtrons, a 6-in-line headstock, and a Bigsby. The name was based on the myth of a guitar virtuoso who lived in obscurity and <b>could</b> <b>never</b> quite <b>get</b> his career off the ground.|$|R
25|$|In 1892, though, Sharpe <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> into {{form and}} he was dropped from the Surrey side long before the season ended. Though he was {{recalled}} in 1893 when Richardson was injured, he did nothing and Surrey released him {{at the end of}} the year. He played for Nottinghamshire a couple of times in 1894, but any hopes he would strengthen their weakening bowling were destroyed very quickly: he took only ten wickets at 28.40 under conditions tremendously favourable to bowlers, and retired at the then-remarkably young age of 28.|$|E
25|$|John Sharpe (John William Sharpe; born 9 December 1866, Ruddington, Nottinghamshire, England; died: 19 June 1936, Ruddington, Nottinghamshire, England) was a bowler who was George Lohmann's {{partner in}} the {{formidable}} Surrey sides that dominated {{the first years of}} the official cricket County Championship. However, because softer and more primitive wickets meant backup bowlers were often unnecessary, Sharpe <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> into form once William Lockwood began developing as a bowler late in 1891, and his county career was, for his time, quite short despite some notable successes in Australia.|$|E
25|$|WVU {{entered the}} game against Pitt as 28 point {{favorites}} {{to win the}} 100th Backyard Brawl and earn a berth in the BCS championship game. The Mountaineers, however, <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> their high-powered offense going against the Panthers and were hurt by fumbles, missed field goals, and ineffective performances by Steve Slaton and Pat White, the latter of whom missed {{part of the game}} with a thumb injury. Pittsburgh, starting their backup QB Pat Bostick, was equally ineffective at moving the ball outside of the play of LeSean McCoy. Trailing by one possession late in the fourth quarter, West Virginia twice had the ball in Pitt territory, with both drives ending in Pat White being stopped on downs. The final Pitt possession saw the Panthers run the ball {{out of the back of}} the end zone for a safety as the clock expired, ending WVU's National Championship hopes.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in 1973, Hawking {{moved into}} the study of quantum gravity and quantum mechanics. His {{work in this area}} was spurred by a visit to Moscow and discussions with Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich and Alexei Starobinsky, whose work showed that {{according}} to the uncertainty principle, rotating black holes emit particles. To Hawking's annoyance, his much-checked calculations produced findings that contradicted his second law, which claimed black holes <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> smaller, and supported Bekenstein's reasoning about their entropy. His results, which Hawking presented from 1974, showed that black holes emit radiation, known today as Hawking radiation, which may continue until they exhaust their energy and evaporate. Initially, Hawking radiation was controversial. However, by the late 1970s and following the publication of further research, the discovery was widely accepted as a significant breakthrough in theoretical physics. Hawking was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1974, {{a few weeks after the}} announcement of Hawking radiation. At the time, he was one of the youngest scientists to become a Fellow.|$|E
25|$|The {{attempt to}} render the laws of reason or thought impersonal by professing to find them {{in the sphere of}} {{spontaneous}} apperception, and above reflective necessity, is unsuccessful. Cause, substance, time, space, are given us as realized in a particular form. In no single act of affirmation of cause or substance, much less in such a primitive act, do we affirm the universality of their application. There may be particular instances or cases of these laws, but we <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> the laws themselves in their universality, far less absolute impersonality. No amount of individual instances of the application of any of them by us would give it a true universality. The only sure test we have of their universality in our experience is the test of their reflective necessity. We thus after all fall back on reflection as our ground for their universal application; mere spontaneity of apprehension is futile; their universality is grounded in their necessity, not their necessity in their universality. How far and in what sense this ground of necessity renders them personal are of course questions still to be solved.|$|E

[...] Despite having {{struggled}} with his 3-point shot all game on 1–8 shooting, he said: [...] "Even though I wasn't hitting, I still wanted the opportunity in the end to shoot the ball." [...] "Scheyer made an unbelievable shot," [...] said Georgia Tech coach Paul Hewitt. [...] "If you're a basketball fan, enjoy {{it for what it}} is." [...] Coach Krzyzewski noted: [...] "There’s something about Scheyer that produces wins.... He's never afraid." [...] Playing Baylor on March 28 in the Elite Eight, he recalled: ...|$|E

500|$|Sayers' {{ability as}} a runner in the open field was {{considered}} unmatched, both during his playing career and since his retirement. Although he possessed modest raw speed—he completed a 100-yard dash in 9.7 seconds—he was highly elusive and had terrific vision, a combination which made him very difficult to tackle. Actor Billy Dee Williams, who portrayed Sayers in the 1971 film Brian's Song, likened his running to [...] "ballet" [...] and [...] "poetry". Mike Ditka, a teammate of Sayers' for two seasons, called him [...] "the greatest player I've ever seen. That's right—the greatest." [...] Another former teammate, linebacker Dick Butkus, famous for his tackling ability, said of Sayers: He had this ability to go full speed, cut and then go full speed again right away. I saw it every day in practice. We played live, and you <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> a clean shot on Gale. Never.|$|E
500|$|Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson: Cameron said {{he needed}} the cast to {{feel as though they}} were really on the Titanic, to relive its liveliness, and [...] "to take that energy and give it to Jack, [...] an artist who is able to have his heart soar". Jack is portrayed as an itinerant, poor orphan from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, who has toured {{numerous}} places in the world, including Paris. He wins two tickets onto the RMS Titanic in a poker game and travels as a third-class passenger with his friend Fabrizio. He is attracted to Rose at first sight and meets her when she contemplates throwing herself off the stern of the ship. Her fiance's [...] "reward", an invitation to dine with them the next evening, enables Jack to mix with the first-class passengers for a night. When casting the role, various established actors, including Matthew McConaughey, Chris O'Donnell, Billy Crudup, and Stephen Dorff, were considered, but Cameron felt that a few of the actors were too old for the part of a 20-year-old. Tom Cruise was interested in portraying the character, but his asking price was too much for the studio to consider. Cameron considered Jared Leto for the role, but Leto refused to audition. DiCaprio, 21 years old at the time, was brought to Cameron's attention by casting director Mali Finn. Initially, {{he did not want to}} portray the character and refused to read his first romantic scene on the set (see below). Cameron said, [...] "He read it once, then started goofing around, and I <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> him to focus on it again. But for one split second, a shaft of light came down from the heavens and lit up the forest." [...] Cameron strongly believed in DiCaprio's acting ability and told him, [...] "Look, I'm not going to make this guy brooding and neurotic. I'm not going to give him a tic and a limp and all the things you want." [...] Cameron rather envisioned the character as a James Stewart type. Although Jack Dawson was a fictional character, in Fairview Cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 121 victims are buried, there is a grave labeled [...] "J. Dawson". The real J. Dawson was Joseph Dawson, who shoveled coal in the bowels of the ship. [...] "It wasn't until after the movie came out that we found out that there was a J. Dawson gravestone," [...] said the film's producer, Jon Landau, in an interview.|$|E

5000|$|The B8500 was {{designed}} in the 1960s {{as an attempt to}} merge the B5500 and the D825 designs. The system used monolithic integrated circuits with magnetic thin-film memory.

2500|$|Keselowski {{appeared}} in victory lane {{to celebrate his}} first win {{of the season in}} front of 102,000 people who attended the race. Keselowski also earned $186,770 in race winnings. Afterward, he said, [...] "This car here, this brand-new car that Penske Racing built -- everybody back at the shop did a phenomenal job. The last few races have been really good, and I knew we had a shot at winning one if we closed the deal. Matt didn't make it easy." [...] Kenseth, who finished second, said, [...] "I was thinking I could run outside of him , but he would roll through there so fast you <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> a run on him. I think he liked the bottom of [...] 1 and 2, but I <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> around on the bottom of [...] 1 and 2, so that {{was the right thing to}} do, to start on the top and leave me on the bottom -- for him." ...|$|E

2500|$|After being {{released}} in 1922, Hedgewar was dismayed {{at the lack}} of organisation among the Congress volunteers for the independence struggle.

Subsequently, he felt the need to create an independent organisation that was based on the country’s traditions and history, and did not draw upon the method of non-violence.|$|E

2500|$|A {{group with}} Burdon, Jenkins, and new sidemen John Weider (guitar/violin/bass), Vic Briggs (guitar/piano), and Danny McCulloch (bass) were formed {{under the name}} Eric Burdon and Animals (or {{sometimes}} Eric Burdon and the New Animals) in December 1966 and changed direction.
