40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} {{development}} of a theory of management which describes what competent managers do or will do and prescribes what other managers could do or should do. The AKT theory of management and six organizational concepts are constructed, tested, and applied to explain and subsume many findings of other related studies The word AKT is made up of the initials of the theory's building blocks or the elements of managers' actions: activities, knowledges, and tasks (Managers' tasks are also the factors for organizational operation (FOOs) from the system viewpoint). The six organizational concepts, namely networked-cones structure, end-means chain, compatibility among FOOs, reflexivity in management, distributed managing, and momentum of organization, form a basic organization theory describing or prescribing the context of management. The analysis of questionnaire and diary data of 1, 659 actions collected from 40 Taiwanese managers supports the AKT theory. Firstly, the nearly constant, significant <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>contingency</b> from the overall and partial cross-tabulations between the 11 manager's activities and 14 manager's tasks suggest that the strength of association between them is independent of the manager's function, level, company, and industry. Secondly, data indicate that all the three building blocks are necessary for the AKT theory to be complete and parsimonious and that Mintzberg's (1973) ten roles theory and the process theories are incomplete and ill-structured Finally, regression analysis showing that managers with more management learning have higher rates of valid diary records justifies the prescriptive dimension in the AKT theory for those with less management learning. Besides, examinations of the characteristics of management practice from the perspectives of the AKT theory's elements modify several previous views. The wide-ranging implications and applications of the AKT theory and six organizational concepts are discussed...|$|R

But such statistical procedures constitute an acknowledgement of failure to rationalize the problem and to establish functions that underlie the data.

Thurstone's approach to measurement was termed the law of comparative judgment. He applied the approach in psychophysics, and later to the measurement of psychological values. The so-called 'Law', which can be regarded as a measurement model, involves subjects making a comparison between each of a number of pairs of stimuli with respect to magnitude of a property, attribute, or attitude. Methods based on the approach to measurement can be used to estimate such scale values.|$|R

40|$|The {{new product}} {{development}} (NPD) is fundamental for company sustainability, {{since it is}} responsible for the creation of new products and the improvement of already existing products. A research line in NPD management is identifying success factors, that is, discriminating practices associated to product development, which, when well executed, contribute towards reducing the unsuccessful rate in launching new products (GRIFFIN, 1997; SOUDER et al., 1997; ERNEST, 2002; ROZENFELD et al.; 2006). The objective of this work is to identify and analyze these factors that influence project development success and unsuccess of new products pertaining to the Brazilian High Technology Small Firms (HTSF) of the medical-hospital equipments sector, located in the State of São Paulo, Brazil. The data were obtained by means of a survey in 30 HTSFs pertaining to the medical-hospital equipment sector. The application resulted in a sample composed of 49 new product projects, out of which 30 were considered as successful (one of each company) and 19 were considered unsuccessful (eleven companies did not submit information of the unsuccessful specific cases), from the companies point of view. During the data treatment phase, various statistical techniques were applied. Initially, the association of the 64 variables investigated was measured with the result of the project product (successful and unsuccessful) by means <b>of</b> the respective <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>contingency.</b> It was also sought to reduce and summarize the individual variables by using the techniques of factorial analysis, more specifically the Analysis of Main Components. Elucidation of the results generated from the statistical procedures enabled to find a set of factors (practices) that affect the success of product development in these HTSFs. Considering of the characteristics of market-target the pre-development activities stand out. The successful projects are those in which user requirements are well served and correctly interpreted concerning specifications. Moreover, market assessment was properly carried out by the company and the clients wanted the new product. Proficiency in executing the activities of technical development was indicated as a determinant factor of success. Specifically, the function concerning preparation and follow-up of documents and reports necessary to homologate the product on account of the legal requirements was considered {{as one of the most}} important aspects by the answerer. The integration of the company areas by project team, also indicated a strong association with the result of the product. Therefore, such factors should be carefully adapted and managed in the development of new products by these companies. Pages: 641 - 64...|$|R

40|$|Distributed erosion {{models are}} {{potentially}} good tools for locating soil sediment sources and guiding efficient Soil and Water Conservation (SWC) planning, but {{the uncertainty of}} model predictions may be high. In this study, the distribution of erosion within a catchment was predicted with a semi-empirical erosion model that combined a semi-distributed hydrological model with the Morgan, Morgan and Finney (MMF) empirical erosion model. The model was tested in a small catchment of the West Usambara Mountains (Kwalei catchment, Tanzania). Soil detachability rates measured in splash cups (0. 48 – 1. 16 g J− 1) were close to model simulations (0. 30 – 0. 35 g J− 1). Net erosion rates measured in Gerlach troughs (0. 01 – 1. 05 kg m− 2 per event) were used to calibrate the sediment transport capacity of overland flow. Uncertainties of model simulations due to parameterisation of overland flow sediment transport capacity were assessed with the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) methodology. The quality of the spatial predictions was assessed by comparing the simulated erosion pattern with the field-observed erosion pattern, measuring the agreement with the weighted Kappa <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> the <b>contingency</b> table. Behavioural parameter sets (weighted Kappa > 0. 50) were those with short reinfiltration length (< 1. 5 m) and ratio of overland flow power to local topography power γ close to 0. 5. In the dynamic Hortonian hydrologic regime and the dissected terrain of Kwalei catchment, topography controlled the distribution of erosion more than overland flow. Simulated erosion rates varied from − 4 to + 2 kg m− 2 per season. The model simulated correctly around 75 % of erosion pattern. The uncertainty of model predictions due to sediment transport capacity was high; around 10 % of the fields were attributed to either slight or severe erosion. The difficult characterisation of catchment-scale effective sediment transport capacity parameters poses a major limit to distributed erosion modelling predicting capabilities...|$|R
