40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSC) from human lipoaspirate {{for the treatment of}} corneal damage in animal models. Methods: The study included data from experiments performed in rats and mice from 2009 to present in Italy and Spain, which are currently underway. <b>Cornea</b> <b>lesion</b> and histological experiments were performed to determine the best animal chemical burn. Rats underwent chemical burn lesions; and mouse eyes underwent laser-induced corneal lesions. Animals were randomly assigned to control or groups treated with stem cells, or blood plasma serum, or adipose tissue. Clinical and histological assessments were compared between groups to determine biosafety, re-epithelization, immunogenicity and efficacy of human derived ADSC in treating epithelialand stromal wounds in animal corneas. Results: Rat eyes treated with stem cells, or serum, or stem cells plus serum showed significantly smaller defect areas at each time point when compared with the control and adipose groups. The stem cell-treated eyes showed faster wound healing with smaller defect areas at each time point when compared to contralateral control eyes (P< 0. 05). Whole layer epithelium regeneration was observed in all stem cell-treated eyes. The epithelium of the stem cell-treated eyes closely resembled the native corneal epithelium. With regards to the mouse experiments, the fluorescein positive corneal lesion area was significantly smaller in the stem cell groups than the control eyes (P< 0. 05); on the first and the second day. Histological assessment indicated that epithelium from the stem cell-treated eyes was similar to uninjured epithelium, composed of 4 to 5 layers of uniform and perfectly structured epithelial cells. Conclusion: ADSC obtained from human lipoaspirate enhanced corneal wound healing in animal models. Corneal treatment with adipose derived stem cells.

40|$|In this 2 -year study, the {{suitability}} of the Hsd:Sprague-Dawley SD (SD) {{as a replacement for}} the Cri:CD BR (CD) rat was assessed by comparing survival rates, palpable mass incidence, body weights, food consumption, clinical laboratory parameters, and necropsy and histopathology observations. At Week 104, survival rates in the CD and SD males were 29 and 49 %, respectively. Corresponding survival rates in females were 44 and 63 %. The total numbers of animals with palpable masses and animals with neoplasms were similar in the CD and SD rats; however, the total numbers of palpable masses and neoplasms were higher in the CD rats. The incidence of <b>cornea!</b> <b>lesions</b> was higher in the SD rats, whereas the incidence of lenticular opacities was higher in the CD rats. Body weights, food and water consumption, and organ weights were significantly lower in the SD rats. In contrast, food intake per kilogram of body weight was slightly higher in the SD rats.

40|$|Ocular thelaziosis {{caused by}} Thelazia callipaeda is a vector-borne disease {{affecting}} dogs and humans. We report {{a case of}} thelaziosis in a 10 -year-old German Shepherd dog from Vila Real city (Portugal). Ophthalmological examination revealed bulbar and nictitating membrane conjunctival hyperemia with serous discharge noted at the left medial canthus and blepharitis. Schirmer tear test value and intraocular pressure were within the reference ranges in both eyes, and biomicroscopy showed a transparent <b>cornea</b> without <b>lesions</b> or edema and no inflammatory reaction in the anterior chamber. No funduscopic alterations were detected by direct and indirect ophthalmoscopic examination. When testing the nasolacrimal patency, two white worms were observed on the caruncle conjunctival surface with undulating movements that increased with light intensity. In total, eight worms were collected and morphologically identified as T. callipaeda (seven mature females and one male). PCR amplification of a 689 sequence of partial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 target gene confirmed the nematodes were T. callipaeda, haplotype 1. The dog was treated with a single subcutaneous injection of ivermectin combined with additional topical application of ophthalmic fusidic acid drops and oral milbemycin oxime. One week after treatment, no worms were detected and the ocular clinical signs resolved. The most recent reports of canine thelaziosis in the Iberian Peninsula should alert local health authorities to the zoonotic potential of infestation with T. callipaeda, which {{should be included in}} the differential diagnosis of conjunctivitis in dogs and humans...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: In 1988, {{a report}} was {{published}} describing the histopathologic examination of corneal buttons of 4 {{patients who had}} undergone unilateral keratoplasty because of decreased vision caused by what had been diagnosed clinically as granular dystrophy. But on pathologic examination, lesions characteristic of both granular dystrophy and lattice dystrophy were found {{in each of the}} 4 corneal buttons. The patients came from 3 different families, each of which traced its origin to the Italian province of Avellino. We studied the clinical and histopathological features of 4 corneas affected by combined granular-lattice dystrophy, adding thereby to the total of 12 other corneas that have been so-described in the literature. METHODS: Two women underwent bilateral penetrating keratoplasty for what was diagnosed clinically as Reis-Bücklers dystrophy in the first patient, and as granular dystrophy in the second patient. We studied all 4 corneas pathologically, using both conventional hematoxylin and eosin stains as well as special histochemical techniques. RESULTS: All 4 <b>corneas</b> contained <b>lesions</b> characteristic of both granular dystrophy and lattice dystrophy, a circumstance that has given rise to the name "combined granular-lattice dystrophy. " The patients are not known to be of Italian ancestry. CONCLUSIONS: Three clinical signs characterize combined granular-lattice dystrophy: (1) anterior stromal discrete, grayish-white deposits; (2) lattice lesions located in mid-stroma to posterior stroma; and (3) anterior stromal haze. Both clinically and histopathologically, the lattice lesions are of greater diameter than are those that occur in lattice dystrophy type I. In the past few years, striking advances have been made in understanding the genetics of combined granular-lattice dystrophy. The most recent of these was published just 2 months before the 1997 meeting of the American Ophthalmological Society, and establishes a common molecular origin for granular dystrophy, lattice dystrophy type I, Avellino dystrophy, and Reis-Bücklers dystrophy...|$|R
40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{are reported in}} which an attempt {{has been made to}} determine the extent to which the eye participates in the general resistance which develops in rabbits during the course of syphilitic infection. Rabbits treated with arsphenamine well after the period when they would be expected to be immune to intratesticular or intracutaneous inoculations were reinoculated with the homologous strain of T. pallidum, the organisms being injected into either the cornea itself or the anterior chamber. Altogether in the three experiments 43 presumably immune animals were injected, 25 into the cornea itself and 18 into the anterior chamber. 41 normal animals were used as controls. In the immune animals 27 or 62 per cent showed <b>lesions</b> in the <b>cornea.</b> 14 of the 43 test animals were inoculated simultaneously in the cornea and in the skin of the back. In 9 of these 14, lesions developed in the <b>cornea</b> although no <b>lesions</b> developed in the skin. The lesions developing in the corneas of the "immune" animals had a longer incubation period on the average, were often of longer duration, and in some instances were more severe than the lesions developing in the control animals. In the case of some animals, also, they showed a greater tendency to recur. The immediate reactions in both the normal and the "immune" animals were entirely comparable and there was no evidence of an accelerated reaction in the test animals. It is concluded that the eye of the syphilitic rabbit does not share to the same extent as other tissues in the general resistant state which develops in that animal during the course of syphilitic infection. Possible explanations for this finding are discussed...|$|R

Bacteriol. 88 : 1503 – 1518. 1964. —A parent strain of Shigella flexneri 2 a and a colonial mutant derived from it were studied in three animal models. Both strains were equally virulent for mice when living cells suspended in hog gastric mucin were injected by the intraperitoneal route. Feeding the parent strain to starved guinea pigs, followed by the intraperitoneal injection of opium, resulted {{in the formation of}} ulcerative lesions in the intestinal tract and in the death of these animals. When the colonial variant was fed to similarly prepared animals, the animals survived and the intestinal tract remained normal. The parent produced diarrheal symptoms and intestinal lesions after its oral administration to rhesus monkeys; the variant caused neither symptoms nor pathology in this species. Studies were carried out to define the characteristics present in the parent strain and absent in the colonial mutant, which would enable the parent to produce ulcerative lesions of the bowel and death in the guinea pig model or intestinal lesions and diarrheal symptoms in the monkey. Neither serological studies nor growth studies conducted both in vitro and in vivo offered a clue to explain this difference. The virulent parent strain was shown to penetrate the bowel epithelium and enter the lamina propria; the avirulent mutant did not do this. Entrance to the lamina propria was by way of the epithelial cell of the mucosa. The avirulent mutant did not possess the capacity to penetrate this cell. This observation was extended to show that the virulent parent possesses the ability to infect and multiply within HeLa cells; furthermore, the organisms are able to penetrate epithelial cells of the guinea pig <b>cornea,</b> causing ulcerative <b>lesions.</b> The avirulent variant possesses neither of these capacities. It is suggested that epithelial cell penetration is a major factor in determining the pathogenicity of dysentery bacilli...|$|R
