5000|$|It wasn't {{until the}} latter half of the 18th century that the modern [...] "fictitious force" [...] {{understanding}} of the centrifugal force as a pseudo-force artifact of rotating reference frames took shape. In a 1746 memoir by Daniel Bernoulli, [...] "the idea that the centrifugal force is fictitious emerges unmistakably." [...] Bernoulli, in seeking to describe the motion of an object relative to an arbitrary point, showed that the magnitude of the centrifugal force depended on which arbitrary point was chosen to measure circular motion about. Later in the 18th century Joseph Louis Lagrange in his Mécanique Analytique explicitly stated that the centrifugal force depends on the rotation of a system of perpendicular axes. In 1835, Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis analyzed arbitrary motion in rotating systems, specifically in relation to waterwheels. He coined the phrase [...] "compound centrifugal force" [...] for a term which bore a similar mathematical expression to that of centrifugal force, albeit that it was multiplied by a factor of two. [...] The force in question was perpendicular to both the velocity of an object relative to a rotating frame of reference and the axis of rotation of the frame. <b>Compound</b> <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> eventually came to be known as the Coriolis Force.|$|E

It {{is involved in the}} magnetic force that acts on a current carrying wire and it is also involved in the electromotive force that induces an electric current in a wire that is moving in a magnetic field. In the former case it is a simple {{centrifugal force}} of the kind that keeps the planets in orbit, whereas in the latter case it is a <b>compound</b> <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> which bears close similarities to the transverse Coriolis force that acts in non-circular planetary orbits and in all vortex phenomena...|$|E

The Coriolis force is a <b>compound</b> <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> that arises when a linear motion is {{physically}} connected to, but independent of a rotatory motion. It is an inertial force that arises from centrifugal pressure in the luminiferous medium. The force involved in the inclined plane is simply a component of gravity. In relation to inertial mass, {{the force of gravity}} is not inertial mass independent when considered with reference to the centre of mass of two gravitating bodies. Abstract. The screw effect was known to the ancients. It employs the principle that a surface reaction at an angle can make an applied force undergo a right angle turn. The screw is a helix, and wherever we see a perpendicular swivel in conjunction with a helix, we must suspect the hidden hand of the Coriolis force to be operating behind the scenes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In 1835, French {{scientist}} Gaspard-Gustave de Coriolis wrote a {{paper in}} which he mathematically derived equations of motion for rotating coordinate systems [1]. In this paper he drew attention to two categories of supplementary forces. Coriolis referred to these forces in the plural. The forces in the first category were the ordinary <b>centrifugal</b> <b>forces,</b> while the forces in the second category were described as being equal to twice {{the product of the}} angular velocity of the mobile plane, taken with respect to the relative momentum as projected unto that plane. By analogy with the mathematical formula for the ordinary <b>centrifugal</b> <b>forces,</b> Coriolis called this second category of supplementary <b>forces</b> ‘The <b>compound</b> <b>centrifugal</b> forces’. This paper aims to establish the fundamental physical cause behind <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> as well as its connection with the medium for the propagation of light...|$|R

Therefore, objects attached to the cable would experience upward <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> in the direction opposing the downward gravitational force. The higher up the cable the object is located, the less the gravitational pull of the Earth, and the stronger the upward <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> due to the rotation, so that more <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> opposes less gravity. The <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> and the gravity are balanced at geosynchronous equatorial orbit (GEO).

50|$|Within {{this view}} of physics, any other {{phenomenon}} that is usually attributed to <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> {{can be used to}} identify absolute rotation.

40|$|Abstract. It is {{nowadays}} {{taught that}} <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> is a fictitious force {{that can only}} be observed from a rotating frame of reference. This teaching is based on the argument that when no inward centripetal force is acting, a particle will proceed in its straight line inertial path. In situations where the physical effects of <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> are detected, this is dismissed as being merely the effects of inertia. Polar coordinates relative to a point origin expose a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> acting on a particle that is moving in a straight line, but this <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> tends to be masked from view by virtue {{of the fact that the}} radial position vector is rotating.

50|$|<b>Centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> {{is needed}} to explain the {{concavity}} {{of the water in}} a co-rotating frame of reference (one that rotates with the water) because the water appears stationary in this frame, and so should have a flat surface. Thus, observers looking at the stationary water need the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> to explain why the water surface is concave and not flat. The <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> pushes the water toward the sides of the bucket, where it piles up deeper and deeper, Pile-up is arrested when any further climb costs as much work against gravity as is the energy gained from the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force,</b> which is greater at larger radius.|$|R

Later, Newton in his Principia crucially limited the description of the dynamics of planetary motion to a frame of reference in which the point of attraction is fixed. In this description, Leibniz's <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> was not needed and was replaced by only continually inward forces toward the fixed point. Newton objected to Leibniz's equation {{on the grounds that it}} allowed for the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> to have a different value from the centripetal force, arguing on the basis of his third law of motion, that the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> and the centripetal force must constitute an equal and opposite action-reaction pair. In this however, Newton was mistaken, as the reactive <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> which is required by the third law of motion is a completely separate concept from the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> of Leibniz's equation.|$|R

5000|$|The star becomes oblate (and hence gravity darkening occurs) {{because the}} <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> {{resulting}} from rotation creates additional outward {{pressure on the}} star.

This means that equatorial regions of a star will have a greater <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> when compared to the pole. The <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> pushes mass away from the axis of rotation, and results in less overall pressure on the gas in the equatorial regions of the star.
