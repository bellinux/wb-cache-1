40|$|The recent Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Metcash Trading Ltd {{decision}} in Australia has left uncertain the correct approach to assessing whether a proposed merger or business acquisition has the likely effect of substantially lessening competition {{in a market}} in breach of s 50 of the Australian Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) or s 47 of the New Zealand Commerce Act 1986. In this article we review the Australian and New Zealand jurisprudence and in summary take the view that assessing whether a merger {{will result in the}} likely effect of a substantial lessening of competition in a market requires a consideration of whether there is a real chance, or a real and substantial risk, of such a substantial lessening of competition. part of the assessment of whether there is such a real chance of a substantial lessening of competition is to consider whether {{in the absence of the}} proposed merger, there is a real chance of a <b>counterfactual</b> <b>scenario</b> arising under which there would be a materially greater level of competition than if the merger took place. it is not necessary for that purpose to establish that a particular <b>counterfactual</b> <b>scenario</b> is more likely than not to occur or to establish that a substantial lessening of competition is more likely than not to occur. in assessing whether there is a real chance of a <b>counterfactual</b> <b>scenario</b> occurring, the court or regulator should not take account of merely speculative possibilities. however, the court or regulator should not be too ready to dismiss the prospect of a more competitive <b>counterfactual</b> <b>scenario</b> occurring as 2 ̆ 2 speculative 2 ̆ 2 in a situation where the merger participants have a strong incentive to pursue a merger transaction and to argue to the court/regulator that there is no feasible procompetitive alternative to the transaction...|$|E
40|$|Argumentative thought {{experiments}} are structurally conditional clauses. They can hence be formalized {{by means of}} the principle of modus ponendo ponens, as well as of modus tollendo tollens. In contrast to the practice in formal logic, exponents of argumentative thought experiments claim that the logical validity of a conclusion drawn within the framework of a particular conditional argument also holds beyond the particular conditional in question. In this paper, I articulate the criticism that this claim is wrong by arguing that the <b>counterfactual</b> <b>scenario</b> sets itself the most determinant premise. If the <b>counterfactual</b> <b>scenario</b> sets the initial conditional premise of the argument, then its true conclusion holds only as a counterfactual truth.

40|$|<b>Counterfactuals,</b> or unrealized <b>scenarios,</b> {{have been}} a focus of {{research}} {{in an array of}} disciplines, though their rhetorical implications have gone largely unexplored. This interdisciplinary study uses a cognitive methodology in taking a fresh look at <b>counterfactual</b> <b>scenarios</b> in discourse. The study argues that when <b>counterfactual</b> <b>scenarios</b> are introduced into discourse and paired with an evaluative stance, the result is a creative and persuasive scenario that allows a speaker to communicate a perspective that a listener may reinforce, revise, or reject. Counterfactuals thus have the ability to convey an evaluation, to convey emotion, to provide a window for disagreement, or to foster solidarity. In literature, <b>counterfactual</b> <b>scenarios</b> additionally serve as an embedded element of discourse that may convey the perspective of characters and/or the implied author. The reader juggles the <b>counterfactual</b> <b>scenarios,</b> and the perspectives they convey, with other textual elements to grasp the meaning of the story. This study furthers previous research on counterfactuality by considering the phenomenon from a cognitive rhetorical perspective. Rather than focusing on counterfactual thinking, as psychologists have done, or on linguistic forms, as linguists have done, this study considers both the cognitive and discursive dimensions of counterfactuals in a fully integrated analysis. Furthermore, this study places counterfactuals within a communicative paradigm that considers the role of both speaker and listener, or author and reader, in developing and interpreting <b>counterfactual</b> <b>scenarios.</b> This study thus demonstrates the largely unrecognized rhetorical dimensions of <b>counterfactual</b> <b>scenarios</b> in both ordinary and literary discourse...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Greg Janzen has {{recently}} criticised my defence of Frankfurt’s counterexample to the Principle of Alternate Possibilities {{by arguing that}} Jones avoids killing Smith in the <b>counterfactual</b> <b>scenario.</b> Janzen’s argument consists in introducing a new thought-experiment {{which is supposed to}} be analogous to Frankfurt’s and where the agent is supposed to avoid A-ing. Here I argue that Janzen’s argument fails on two counts, because his new scenario is not analogous to Frankfurt’s and because the agent in his new scenario does not avoid A-ing. According to the Principle of Alternate Possibilities (PAP), an agent is morally responsible for A-ing only if she could have done otherwise than A-ing. This plausible principle has been famously challenged by Harry Frankfurt’s counterexample (1969), where counterfactual intervener Black will make Jones kill Smith in case Jones does not kill Smith on his own. In case Jones does kill Smith on his own without Black’s intervention, Jones is responsible for killing Smith even though Jones could not have done otherwise than kill Smith because in the <b>counterfactual</b> <b>scenario</b> Black would have made him kill Smith.

40|$|The newly {{independent}} Republic of Moldova joined the World Bank and the IMF in 1992. The World Bank designated it a ?middle-income? country, a status it retained for Bretton Woods lending until 1997. The middle-income designation {{implied that the}} government of Moldova was not eligible for concessionary lending from the World Bank and IMF, and would not receive concessionary finance from the major bilateral development agencies. After demonstrating that assigning middle-income status to Moldova was a mistake, which was implicitly conceded by the World Bank in 1997, this Country Study investigates the consequences. It uses a simple procedure for calculating <b>counterfactual</b> <b>scenarios</b> based on assigning Moldova low-income status in the early 1990 s. The <b>counterfactual</b> <b>scenarios</b> suggest that the development and welfare costs of the mistake were extremely high: a much greater fall in income per capita than would otherwise have been the case, with an associated increase in headcount poverty and lower life expectancy. There is a cruel irony associated with this mistake. Had Moldova been designated a low-income country in the early 1990 s, it would have been by the mid- 2000 s a middle-income country instead of remaining the poorest country in Europe. Thus, there is a strong case for multilateral compensation. Moldova; Income; Human Development Costs; Poverty...|$|R

40|$|Inferring causal {{effects from}} an {{observational}} study is challenging because participants are not randomized to treatment. Observational studies in infectious disease research present the additional challenge that one participant's treatment may affect another participant's outcome, i. e., {{there may be}} interference. In this paper recent approaches to defining causal effects {{in the presence of}} interference are considered, and new causal estimands designed specifically for use with observational studies are proposed. Previously defined estimands target <b>counterfactual</b> <b>scenarios</b> in which individuals independently select treatment with equal probability. However, in settings where there is interference between individuals within clusters, it may be unlikely that treatment selection is independent between individuals in the same cluster. The proposed causal estimands instead describe <b>counterfactual</b> <b>scenarios</b> in which the treatment selection correlation structure is the same as in the observed data distribution, allowing for within-cluster dependence in the individual treatment selections. These estimands may be more relevant for policy-makers or public health officials who desire to quantify the effect of increasing the proportion of treated individuals in a population. Inverse probability-weighted estimators for these estimands are proposed. The large-sample properties of the estimators are derived, and a simulation study demonstrating the finite-sample performance of the estimators is presented. The proposed methods are illustrated by analyzing data from a study of cholera vaccination in over 100, 000 individuals in Bangladesh. Comment: 31 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

40|$|This {{preliminary}} survey examines how 30 native speakers and 30 Spanish learners of French evoke <b>counterfactual</b> <b>scenarios</b> from a semantic and a lexical perspective. Counterfactual thinking {{is a universal}} cognitive process in which reality is confronted with an imagined view {{of what might have}} been (Kahneman & Tversky 1982). The world as we know it is based on a set of enabling conditions that can be mutated, i. e., modified in order to evoke counterfactual worlds. This can be done by modifying various elements in a sentence. For example, speakers might produce <b>counterfactual</b> <b>scenarios</b> by replacing an accusative (1) or by changing some attribute of the subject (2). (1) I should have had coffee at breakfast rather than tea. (2) If I were a man, my life would have been quite different. In each case, a specific language property is changed. Example (1) results from a modification operated on transitivity, and example (2) on affectedness. While counterfactual thinking is universal, its concrete form is only shaped in childhood together with the acquisition of the first language. Is this concrete form preserved or changed in second language acquisition? Earlier research has shown that speakers of different languages have different preferences to do that (Repiso 2013). This survey compares whether non-native speakers of French adopt the same preferences which native speakers have at the level of Verb-Argument Constructions (VACs) ...|$|R
