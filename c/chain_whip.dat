5|$|Lords of Shadow is a third-person action-adventure game {{in which}} the player {{controls}} the main character, Gabriel Belmont. The combat involves a retractable <b>chain</b> <b>whip</b> called the Combat Cross. The player can perform up to forty unlockable combos with it. The commands consist of direct attacks for dealing damage to single enemies, and weak area attacks when surrounded by them. It is also capable of interactions with secondary weapons, such as knives, holy water and other items which can be upgraded. In addition, the Combat Cross's melee skills can be combined with the Light and Shadow magic system, which are spells aimed at defense and aggression, respectively. The whip is upgradeable and {{can also be used}} to guard against an opponent's attack.|$|E
5|$|Designed as {{a weapon}} with the longest reach in Soulcalibur, Ivy's sword Valentine {{consists}} of several smaller blades linked together by a chain, able to take either broadsword or <b>chain</b> <b>whip</b> forms. These forms are represented by different stances Ivy can use in the series, altering many of her attacks for each and applying different uses to either form of the weapon, with some, such as Spiral Lust, a component of an existing attack. In addition to these the sword can also have the segments be split apart, in which case they will attack the opponent in different ways before recombining on the sword's chain. Due to her variety, Ivy has been noted as being able to attack from any range, however she has also been described as difficult to properly use unless utilizing a range the opponent is weakest at. However, attacks such as Ivy Brambler allow her greater variety in range, and allow for chaining into other attacks upon a successful strike. Other attacks, such as Summoning Suffering and Calamity Symphony, involve grappling with the opponent to damage them, though utilize complex controller inputs that require them to be utilized in tandem with other moves. With the Xbox Live release of Soulcalibur, due to its complexity the former was utilized for an achievement.|$|E

50|$|<b>Chain</b> <b>whip</b> {{techniques}} may {{be combined}} with jumping kicks and other acrobatics. Double <b>chain</b> <b>whip</b> forms have been developed, as have forms in which a <b>chain</b> <b>whip</b> is coupled with a broadsword.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chain</b> <b>whip</b> {{forms are}} often {{extremely}} elaborate. In some, the <b>chain</b> <b>whip</b> is {{thrown in the}} air and caught, flicked around the neck, or flung around underneath a recumbent performer. One classic technique, used to accelerate a spinning <b>chain</b> <b>whip,</b> involves rapidly wrapping and unwrapping the length of the chain around various parts of the body, including the legs, neck and elbows. Various twisting or flicking motions cause the <b>chain</b> <b>whip</b> to gain momentum as it unwraps. In practice, wrapping then unwrapping is used to change the direction of the spin in response to the opponent's movement.|$|E
50|$|Just {{like the}} <b>chain</b> <b>whip,</b> {{excellent}} hand-eye coordination {{is a must}} for the practitioner to use this weapon well. In some Wushu training regimens, the <b>chain</b> <b>whip</b> and Changquan are prerequisites for learning the rope dart.|$|E

5000|$|Vella is {{a female}} swordsman who, like Lann, uses Twin Swords. She {{exhibits}} {{the power of}} wind, using it to slip directly through enemies, deflect most projectiles, and pull enemies into one spot, bolstering her counter-attacking ability. Although her play style seems identical to Lann, she has much less damage potential through normal and smash attacks, as her whole play style revolves around counter-attacking. Her alternate weapons are Chain Blades, a pair of <b>chain</b> <b>whips</b> with blades attached to them, allowing her to attack from great distances, restrain enemies, increasing her damage output, {{at the cost of}} counter-attacking abilities and decreased survival.|$|R

The shark tooth club was given the edge.|$|R
5000|$|According to {{the book}} The <b>Chain</b> <b>Whip,</b> this may refer to the hard whip (more akin to a {{truncheon}} than a multi-section whip) due to the ambiguity in the Chinese.

50|$|When the {{new school}} year began in September, SCLC and the GCFM {{encouraged}} more than 450 black students to register at the formerly white schools under a court desegregation order. This {{was by far the}} largest school integration attempt in Mississippi since the Brown v. Board of Education ruling in 1954. The all-white school board resisted fiercely, whites threatened black parents with economic retaliation if they did not withdraw their children, and by {{the first day of school}} the number of black children registered in the white schools had dropped to approximately 250. On the first day of class, September 12, a furious white mob organized by the Klan attacked the black children and their parents with clubs, <b>chains,</b> <b>whips,</b> and pipes as they walked to school, injuring many and hospitalizing several with broken bones. Police and Mississippi State Troopers made no effort to halt or deter the mob violence.|$|R

40|$|The {{electron}} spin resonance spectra of spin-label positional isomers of stearic acid (n-SASL) incorporated into nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAcChoR) reconstituted into dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) were deconvoluted into bilayer- and protein-associated components by subtraction under conditions of slow exchange. The selectivity of n-SASL (n = 6, 9, 12, and 14) for the lipid-protein interface of the nAcChoR was threefold {{greater than that of}} DOPC and independent of the spin label position. The temperature at which exchange became apparent as judged from lineshape broadening of the mobile lipid component spectrum was dependent upon the position of the spin-label moiety; near the bilayer center, exchange broadening occurred at lower temperatures than it did closer to the lipid headgroup. This suggests that the lipid headgroup region of boundary lipids is relatively fixed, whereas its acyl <b>chain</b> <b>whips</b> on and off the protein with increasing frequency near the bilayer center. Motions on the microsecond time scale were examined by microwave power saturation. Each n-SASL saturated more readily when incorporated into vesicles containing the nAcChoR than when in pure DOPC liposomes. Therefore, lipid mobility is perturbed by the nAcChoR on the microsecond time scale with an apparent magnitude that is relatively modest, probably due to exchange on this time scale...|$|R
