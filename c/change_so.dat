5|$|Despite the {{proclamation}} of independence, neither the Belgian nor the Congolese government intended the colonial social order to end immediately. The Belgian government hoped that whites might keep their position indefinitely. The Republic of the Congo was still reliant on colonial {{institutions like the}} Force Publique to function from day to day, and white technical experts, installed by the Belgians, were retained in the broad absence of suitably qualified black Congolese replacements (partly the result of colonial restrictions regarding higher education). Many Congolese people had assumed that independence would produce tangible and immediate social <b>change,</b> <b>so</b> the retention of whites in positions of importance was widely resented.|$|E
5|$|As {{the rate}} of cooling is {{increased}} the carbon will have less time to migrate to form carbide at the grain boundaries but will have increasingly large amounts of pearlite of a finer and finer structure within the grains; hence the carbide is more widely dispersed and acts to prevent slip of defects within those grains, resulting in hardening of the steel. At the very high cooling rates produced by quenching, the carbon has no time to migrate but is locked within the face center austenite and forms martensite. Martensite is a highly strained and stressed, supersaturated form of carbon and iron and is exceedingly hard but brittle. Depending on the carbon content, the martensitic phase takes different forms. Below 0.2% carbon, it takes on a ferrite BCC crystal form, but at higher carbon content it takes a body-centered tetragonal (BCT) structure. There is no thermal activation energy for the transformation from austenite to martensite. Moreover, there is no compositional <b>change</b> <b>so</b> the atoms generally retain their same neighbors.|$|E
5|$|This {{ability to}} provide {{real-time}} tissue loading data allows the computer to indicate the diver's current decompression obligation, and to update it for any permissible profile <b>change,</b> <b>so</b> the diver with a decompression ceiling {{does not have to}} decompress at any specific depth provided the ceiling is not violated, though the decompression rate will be affected by the depth. As a result, the diver can make a slower ascent than would be called for by a decompression schedule computed by the identical algorithm, as may suit the circumstances, and will be credited for gas elimination during the slower ascent, and penalized if necessary for additional ingassing for those tissues affected. This provides the diver with an unprecedented flexibility of dive profile while remaining within the safety envelope of the algorithm in use.|$|E

25|$|There {{is also a}} lack of good {{water rights}} that govern the use of water {{resulting}} in confusion about what body or individual {{has the right to}} use a particular water resource. Institutions are state agencies and whenever the political atmosphere and leadership <b>change,</b> <b>so</b> does the leadership of the institutions. This constant turnover in leadership does not lend itself to successful management of water resources institutions.|$|E
25|$|If pain is relieved, {{the test}} is {{considered}} positive for rotator-cuff impingement, of which tendinitis and bursitis are major causes. However, partial rotator-cuff tears may also demonstrate good pain relief, so a positive response cannot rule out a partial rotator-cuff tear. However, with demonstration of good, pain-free function, treatment will not <b>change,</b> <b>so</b> {{the test is}} useful in helping to avoid overtesting or unnecessary surgery.|$|E

25|$|Although Marxism {{had some}} impact in Britain, {{it was far}} less than in many other European countries, with {{philosophers}} such as John Ruskin and John Stuart Mill having much greater influence.

25|$|Many butterworts cycle between rosettes {{composed}} of carnivorous and non-carnivorous leaves as the seasons <b>change,</b> <b>so</b> these two ecological groupings {{can be further}} divided according {{to their ability to}} produce different leaves during their growing season. If the growth in the summer is different in size or shape to that in the early spring (for temperate species) or in the winter (tropical species), then plants are considered heterophyllous; whereas uniform growth identifies a homophyllous species.|$|E

25|$|This {{aliasing}} {{is visible}} in images such as posters with lenticular printing: if they have low angular resolution, then as one moves past them, say from left-to-right, the 2D image does not initially <b>change</b> (<b>so</b> it appears to move left), then as one moves to the next angular image, the image suddenly changes (so it jumps right) – and the frequency and amplitude of this side-to-side movement corresponds to the angular resolution of the image (and, for frequency, {{the speed of the}} viewer's lateral movement), which is the angular aliasing of the 4D light field.|$|E
25|$|Except for {{a system}} {{undergoing}} a first-order phase change such as the melting of ice, as a closed system receives heat, without change in its volume and without change in external force fields acting on it, its temperature rises. For a system undergoing such a phase <b>change</b> <b>so</b> slowly that {{departure from thermodynamic equilibrium}} can be neglected, its temperature remains constant as the system is supplied with latent heat. Conversely, a loss of heat from a closed system, without phase change, without change of volume, and without change in external force fields acting on it, decreases its temperature.|$|E
25|$|Self-efficacy is an individual's {{impression}} {{of their own}} ability to perform a demanding or challenging task such as facing an exam or undergoing surgery. This impression is based upon factors like the individual's prior success in the task or in related tasks, the individual's physiological state, and outside sources of persuasion. Self-efficacy {{is thought to be}} predictive of the amount of effort an individual will expend in initiating and maintaining a behavioural <b>change,</b> <b>so</b> although self-efficacy is not a behavioural change theory per se, it is an important element of many of the theories, including the health belief model, the theory of planned behaviour and the health action process approach.|$|E

25|$|Transsexual self-identified people {{sometimes}} wish to undergo physical surgery to refashion their primary sexual characteristics, secondary characteristics, or both, {{because they feel}} {{they will be more}} comfortable with different genitalia. This may involve removal of penis, testicles or breasts, or the fashioning of a penis, vagina or breasts. In the past, sex assignment surgery has been performed on infants who are born with ambiguous genitalia. However, current medical opinion is strongly against this procedure, since many adults have regretted that these decisions were made for them at birth. Today, sex reassignment surgery is performed on people who choose to have this <b>change</b> <b>so</b> that their anatomical sex will match their gender identity.|$|E
25|$|Continuing {{weight loss}} may {{deteriorate}} into wasting, a vaguely defined condition called cachexia. Cachexia differs from starvation {{in part because}} it involves a systemic inflammatory response. It is associated with poorer outcomes. In the advanced stages of progressive disease, metabolism can <b>change</b> <b>so</b> that they lose weight even when they are getting what is normally regarded as adequate nutrition and the body cannot compensate. This leads to a condition called anorexia cachexia syndrome (ACS) and additional nutrition or supplementation is unlikely to help. Symptoms of weight loss from ACS include severe weight loss from muscle rather than body fat, loss of appetite and feeling full after eating small amounts, nausea, anemia, weakness and fatigue.|$|E
25|$|If {{the cancer}} has spread beyond the prostate, {{treatment}} options significantly <b>change,</b> <b>so</b> most doctors that treat prostate cancer {{use a variety}} of nomograms to predict the probability of spread. Treatment by watchful waiting/active surveillance, HIFU, external beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy, cryosurgery, and surgery are, in general, offered to men whose cancer remains within the prostate. Hormonal therapy and chemotherapy are often reserved for disease that has spread beyond the prostate. However, there are exceptions: Radiation therapy may be used for some advanced tumors, and hormonal therapy is used for some early stage tumors. Cryotherapy (the process of freezing the tumor), hormonal therapy, and chemotherapy may also be offered if initial treatment fails and the cancer progresses.|$|E
