The investigations of a flat-plate boundary-layer flow with Mach number 2. 67 and zero pressure gradient are performed using direct numerical simulations.

40|$|Typically ∼ 5 {{percent of}} the total baryonic mass in {{luminous}} elliptical galaxies {{is in the form of}} <b>cooled</b> interstellar <b>gas.</b> Although the mass contributed by <b>cooled</b> <b>gas</b> is small relative to the mass of the old stellar system in these galaxies, it is almost certainly concentrated within the optical effective radius where it can influence the local dynamical mass. However, the mass of <b>cooled</b> <b>gas</b> cannot be confined to very small galactic radii (r < ∼ 0. 01 re) since its mass would greatly exceed that of known central mass concentrations in giant ellipticals, normally attributed to massive black holes. We explore the proposition that a population of very low mass, optically dark stars is created from the <b>cooled</b> <b>gas.</b> For a wide variety of assumed radial distributions for the interstellar cooling, we find that the mass of <b>cooled</b> <b>gas</b> contributes significantly (∼ 30 percent) to stellar dynamical mass to light ratios which, as a result, are expected to vary with galactic radius. However, if the stars formed from <b>cooled</b> interstellar <b>gas</b> are optically luminous, their pertubation on the the mass to light ratio of the old stellar population may be reduced. Cooling mass dropout also perturbs the local apparent X-ray surface brightness distribution, often in a positive sense for centrally concentrated cooling.

40|$|Previous {{observations}} of quasar host halos at z= 2 have uncovered {{large quantities of}} <b>cool</b> <b>gas</b> that exceed what is found around inactive galaxies of both lower and higher masses. To better understand {{the source of this}} excess <b>cool</b> <b>gas,</b> we compiled an exhaustive sample of 195 quasars at z= 1 with constraints on chemically enriched, <b>cool</b> <b>gas</b> traced by MgII absorption in background quasar spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. This quasar sample spans a broad range of luminosities from Lbol= 10 ^ 44. 4 to 10 ^ 46. 8 erg/s and allows an investigation of whether halo gas properties are connected with quasar properties. We find a strong correlation between luminosity and <b>cool</b> <b>gas</b> covering fraction. In particular, low-luminosity quasars exhibit a mean gas covering fraction comparable to inactive galaxies of similar masses, but more luminous quasars exhibit excess <b>cool</b> <b>gas</b> approaching what is reported previously at z= 2. Moreover, 30 - 40 % of the MgII absorption occurs at radial velocities of |v|> 300 km/s from the quasar, inconsistent with gas bound to a typical quasar host halo. The large velocity offsets and observed luminosity dependence of the <b>cool</b> <b>gas</b> near quasars can be explained if the gas arises from: (1) neighboring halos correlated through large-scale structure at Mpc scales, (2) feedback from luminous quasars, or (3) debris from the mergers thought to trigger luminous quasars. The first of these scenarios is in tension with the lack of correlation between quasar luminosity and clustering while the latter two make distinct predictions that can be tested with additional observations.

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} {{a review of}} the current state of knowledge on the cool (T ~ 1 e 4 K) halo gas content around massive galaxies at z ~ 0. 2 - 2. Over the last decade, significant {{progress has been made in}} characterizing the <b>cool</b> circumgalactic <b>gas</b> in massive halos of Mh ~ 1 e 12 - 1 e 14 Msun at intermediate redshifts using absorption spectroscopy. Systematic studies of halo gas around massive galaxies beyond the nearby universe are made possible by large spectroscopic samples of galaxies and quasars in public archives. In addition to accurate and precise constraints for the incidence of <b>cool</b> <b>gas</b> in massive halos, detailed characterizations of gas kinematics and chemical compositions around massive quiescent galaxies at z ~ 0. 5 have also been obtained. Combining all available measurements shows that infalling clouds from external sources are likely the primary source of <b>cool</b> <b>gas</b> detected at d >~ 100 kpc from massive quiescent galaxies. The origin of the gas closer in is currently less certain, but SNe Ia driven winds appear to contribute significantly to <b>cool</b> <b>gas</b> found at d < 100 kpc.

We highlight the beta and star formation rate surface density dependence of the column density, emission measure, radiative efficiency, and velocity. At r_cool, the gas produces X-ray and then UV/optical line emission with a total power bounded by 10 ^{- 2 } L_star if the flow is powered by steady-state star formation with luminosity L_star. The wind is thermally unstable at r_cool, potentially leading to a multi-phase medium. Cooled winds decelerate significantly in the extended gravitational potential of galaxies. The <b>cool</b> <b>gas</b> precipitated from hot outflows may explain its prevalence in galactic halos. We forward a picture of winds whereby cool clouds are initially accelerated by the ram pressure of the hot flow, but are rapidly shredded by hydrodynamical instabilities, thereby increasing beta, seeding radiative and thermal instability, and <b>cool</b> <b>gas</b> rebirth. If the cooled wind shocks as it sweeps up the circumgalactic medium, its cooling time is short, thus depositing <b>cool</b> <b>gas</b> far out into the halo. Finally, conduction can dominate energy transport in low-beta hot winds, leading to flatter temperature profiles than otherwise expected, potentially consistent with X-ray observations of some starbursts.
