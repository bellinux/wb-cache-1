40|$|Abstract — Secure {{communication}} generally {{begins with}} a connection establishment phase in which messages are exchanged by client and server protocol software to generate, share, and use secret data or keys. This message exchange {{is referred to as}} an authentication or key distribution cryptographic protocol. CAPSL is a formal language for specifying cryptographic protocols. It is also useful for addressing the correctness of the protocols on an abstract level, rather than the strength of the underlying cryptographic algorithms. We outline the design principles of CAPSL and its integrated specification and analysis environment. Protocols for secure group management are essential in applications that are concerned with <b>confidential</b> authenticated <b>communication</b> among coalition members, authenticated group decisions, or the secure administration of group membership and access control.

To be considered a viable candidate in the emerging wireless networks, despite the clear benefits of location-independent security, CCN must at least have parity with existing solutions for <b>confidential</b> and anonymous <b>communication.</b> This paper designs a new cryptographic scheme, called Asymmetric Index Encapsulation (AIE), that enables the router to test whether an encapsulated header matches the token without learning anything else about both of them. We suggest using the AIE as the core protocol of anonymous Content Centric Networking. A construction of AIE which strikes a balance between efficiency and security is given. The scheme is proved to be secure based on the DBDH assumption in the random oracle with tight reduction, while the encapsulated header and the token in our system consist of only three elements...|$|R

40|$|A {{receiver}}-anonymous channel {{allows a}} sender {{to send a}} message to a receiver without an adversary learning for whom the message is intended. Wireless broadcast channels naturally provide receiver anonymity, as does multi-casting one message to a receiver population containing the intended receiver. While anonymity and confidentiality appear to be orthogonal properties, making anonymous <b>communication</b> <b>confidential</b> is more involved than one might expect, since the ciphertext might reveal which public key has been used to encrypt. To address this problem, public-key cryptosystems with enhanced security properties have been proposed. This paper investigates constructions as well as limitations for preserving receiver anonymity when using public-key encryption (PKE). We use the constructive cryptography approach by Maurer and Renner and interpret cryptographic schemes as constructions of a certain ideal resource (e. g. a confidential anonymous channel) from given real resources (e. g. a broadcast channel). We define appropriate anonymous communication resources and show that a very natural resource can be constructed by using a PKE scheme which fulfills three properties that appear in cryptographic literature (IND-CCA, key-privacy, weak robustness) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Like the {{conventional}} two-user interference channel, the cognitive interference channel {{consists of two}} transmitters whose signals interfere at two receivers. It is assumed {{that there is a}} common message (message 1) known to both transmitters, and an additional independent message (message 2) known only to the cognitive transmitter (transmitter 2). The cognitive receiver (receiver 2) needs to decode messages 1 and 2, while the noncognitive receiver (receiver 1) should decode only message 1. Furthermore, message 2 is assumed to be a confidential message which needs to be kept as secret as possible from receiver 1, which is viewed as an eavesdropper with regard to message 2. The level of secrecy is measured by the equivocation rate. In this paper, a single-letter expression for the capacity-equivocation region of the discrete memoryless cognitive interference channel is obtained. The capacity-equivocation region for the Gaussian cognitive interference channel is also obtained explicitly. Moreover, particularizing the capacity-equivocation region to the case without a secrecy constraint, the capacity region for the two-user cognitive interference channel is obtained, by providing a converse theorem.
