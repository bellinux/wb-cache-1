25|$|Matthias Kuhle's {{geological}} {{theory of}} Ice Age development was {{suggested by the}} existence of an ice sheet covering the Tibetan Plateau during the Ice Ages (Last Glacial Maximum?). According to Kuhle, the plate-tectonic uplift of Tibet past the snow-line has led to a surface of c. 2,400,000 square kilometres (930,000 sq mi) changing from bare land to ice with a 70% greater albedo. The reflection of energy into space resulted in a global cooling, triggering the Pleistocene Ice Age. Because this highland is at a subtropical latitude, with 4 to 5 times the insolation of high-latitude areas, what would be Earth's strongest heating surface has turned into a <b>cooling</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
500|$|Water is {{essential}} to a thermal power station, to create the steam to turn the steam turbines and generate electricity. Water used in the power station at Blyth was extracted from the Blyth Harbour tidal basin at the ash dock. Once used in the station, the hot water had to be cooled {{before it could be}} discharged. Condensers were used to convert steam from the turbines back into water. The stations' condensers were of twin two-pass design and had a total <b>cooling</b> <b>surface</b> of [...] Condensed water was then extracted by two duty pumps. The water then passed through a drains cooler. The cooled waste water was discharged into the sea off Cambois beach below low tide level.|$|E
2500|$|A Davies condenser, {{also known}} as a double surface condenser, is similar to the Liebig condenser, but with three {{concentric}} glass tubes instead of two. [...] The coolant circulates in both the outer jacket and the central tube. This increases the <b>cooling</b> <b>surface,</b> so that the condenser can be shorter than an equivalent Liebig condenser.|$|E

50|$|A radiant {{cooling system}} is a system using a {{temperature-controlled}} <b>surface</b> that <b>cools</b> indoor temperatures by the removing sensible heat and where {{more than half of}} heat transfer occurs through thermal radiation.Heat will flow from objects, occupants, equipment and lights in a space to a <b>cooled</b> <b>surface</b> as long as their temperatures are warmer than that of the <b>cooled</b> <b>surface</b> and they are within the line of sight of the <b>cooled</b> <b>surface.</b> The process of radiant exchange has a negligible effect on air temperature, but through the process of convection, the air temperature will be lowered when air comes in contact with the <b>cooled</b> <b>surface.</b> Radiant <b>cooling</b> systems use the opposite effect of radiant heating systems, which rely on the process of heat flow from a heated surface to objects and occupants.|$|R

2500|$|The XRON-I uses a {{manually}} started 40hp two-cycle engine with a {{gross weight}} capability of 500lb. The fuselage {{is a simple}} box-beam construction. The rotor uses co-axial blades which alleviate {{the need for an}} anti-torque tail rotor. Yaw control is provided by rotor tip mounted [...] "tip brakes" [...] providing differential torque between the rotors. Gyrodyne patented the control on 24 October 1954 Patent No. 2,835,331. There is a small inverted V-tail for control at forward speeds. The rotors are laminated wood construction.

2500|$|Depending on the {{application}} (chemical components being separated, and the required operating temperature) and {{the scale of the}} process (from very few microliters to process scales involving many liters), different types of condensers and means of cooling are used. Alongside the temperature differential and heat capacities of the cooling fluids (e.g., air, water, aqueous-organic co-solvents), the size of the <b>cooling</b> <b>surface</b> {{and the way in which}} gas (vapor) and condensing liquid states come into contact are critical in the choice or design of a condenser system. Since at least the 19th century, scientists have sought creative designs to maximize the surface area of vapor-liquid contact and heat exchange. Many types of laboratory condensers—simpler Liebig and Allihn, coiled Graham types, simple and Dimroth types of cold finger condensers, etc.—now common, have evolved to meet the practical need of larger cooling surfaces and controlled boiling and condensation in various procedures involving distillation, and a further very wide array of materials for [...] "packing" [...] simpler condensers to increase surface area (e.g., glass, ceramic, and metal beads, rings, wool, etc.) have been studied and applied.|$|E
2500|$|Ulva's {{interior}} is moorland, while the spectacular geological formations {{of the south}} coast, have been somewhat overshadowed by those of its neighbour Staffa. Nonetheless, they are still renowned in their own right. Around 60 million years ago, the region was volcanically active, with Ben More on Mull being the remnant of a volcano, {{and it was in}} this period that the famous rock formations of Staffa and the basaltic columns of [...] "The Castles" [...] on Ulva came into being. The lava flows are known as the [...] "Staffa Magma Type member" [...] and can also be seen on Mull at Carsaig, Ardtum, and near Tobermory on its east coast. They are particularly rich in silica. [...] These were formed when the <b>cooling</b> <b>surface</b> of the mass of hot lava cracked in a hexagonal pattern in a similar way to drying mud cracking as it shrinks, and these cracks gradually extended down into the mass of lava as it cooled and shrank to form the columns which were subsequently exposed by erosion.|$|E

60|$|The grand {{conception}} of a gradual becoming, instead of a sudden making, which Kant and Laplace thus applied to the component bodies of the universe at large, was further applied by Lyell and his school to the outer crust of this one particular petty planet of ours. While the astronomers went in {{for the evolution of}} suns, stars, and worlds, Lyell and his geological brethren went in for the evolution of the earth's surface. As theirs was stellar, so his was mundane. If the world began by being a red-hot mass of planetary matter in a high state of internal excitement, boiling and dancing with the heat of its emotions, it gradually cooled down with age and experience, for growing old is growing cold, as every one of us in time, alas, discovers. As it passed from its fiery and volcanic youth to its staider and soberer middle age, a solid crust began to form in filmy fashion upon its <b>cooling</b> <b>surface.</b> The aqueous vapour that had floated at first as steam around its heated mass condensed with time into a wide ocean over the now hardened shell. Gradually this ocean shifted its bulk into two or three main bodies that sank into hollows of the viscid crust, the precursors of Atlantic, Pacific, and the Indian Seas. Wrinklings of the crust, produced by the cooling and consequent contraction, gave rise at first to baby mountain ranges, and afterwards to the earliest rough draughts of the still very vague and sketchy continents. The world grew daily more complex and more diverse; it progressed, in accordance with the Spencerian law, from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous, and so forth, as aforesaid, with delightful regularity.|$|E
