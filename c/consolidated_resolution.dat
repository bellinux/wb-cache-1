5000|$|Kazakh {{officials}} have called upon the UN Security Council {{to adopt a}} <b>consolidated</b> <b>resolution</b> on the escalation of conflict in Lebanon. [...] "Kazakhstan calls the conflicting parties to an immediate ceasefire and considers it necessary that the UN Security Council adopt a <b>consolidated</b> <b>resolution</b> on the escalation of conflict in Lebanon," [...] stated Ilyas Omarov, press secretary of the Kazakh foreign ministry. [...] "We deeply regret about the continuing escalation of the conflict causing sufferings of the peaceful population of Lebanon, Palestine, and Israel. Kazakhstan believes that military actions should not cause casualties among peaceful population or demolition of social infrastructure, {{as well as a}} humanitarian crisis," [...] he stated. [...] "A decision of Israel to suspend the air strikes for 48 hours must become a first step on the way to cessation of military actions in the region." ...|$|E

5000|$|On January 16, 2003, Senator Russ Feingold {{introduced}} legislation {{to suspend the}} activity of the IAO and the Total Information Awareness program pending a Congressional review of privacy issues involved. [...] A similar measure introduced by Senator Ron Wyden would have prohibited the IAO from operating within the United States unless specifically authorized to do so by Congress, and would have shut the IAO down entirely 60 days after passage unless either the Pentagon prepared a report to Congress assessing the impact of IAO activities on individual privacy and civil liberties or the President certified the program's research as vital to national security interests. In February 2003, Congress passed legislation suspending activities of the IAO pending a Congressional report of the office's activities (<b>Consolidated</b> Appropriations <b>Resolution,</b> 2003, No.108-7, Division M, §111(b) Feb. 20, 2003).|$|R
50|$|Following {{the first}} wave of the {{revolutions}} of 1848, Emperor Ferdinand I enacted Austria's first formal constitution. The constitution abolished the estates and called for a separation of executive and judicial authority, crippling most existing regional institutions and leaving district offices as the backbone of the empire's administration. An 1849 Imperial <b>Resolution</b> <b>consolidated</b> and reaffirmed and revised the system.The law was implemented in 1850, many districts now already in their present-day borders. Small to medium towns and villages were arranged into districts of ten to thirty municipalities each. Larger cities were made districts of their own; these cities would from now on be referred to as statutory cities. The first statutory cities in regions that are still part of Austria today were Vienna, Graz, Innsbruck, and Klagenfurt.|$|R

These {{funds were}} used to support our research that is aimed at determining the entire sequence of the gene rich regions of the genome of the legume, Medicago truncatula, by allowing us to obtain {{a greater degree of}} finished BAC sequences from the draft sequences we have already obtained through research funded by the Noble Foundation. During the funding period we increased the number of Medicago truncatula BACs with finished (Bermuda standard) sequences from 109 to 359, and the total number of BACs for which we collected sequence data from 584 to 842, 359 of which reached phase 2 (ordered and oriented contigs). We also sequenced a series of pooled BAC clones that cover additional euchromatic (gene rich) genomic regions. This work resulted in 6 refereed publications, see below. Genes whose sequence was determined during this study included multiple members of the plant disease resistance (R-gene) family as well as several genes involved in flavinoid biosynthesis, nitrogen fixation and plant-microbial symbosis. This work also served as a prelude to obtaining NSF funding for the international collaborative effort to complete the entire sequence of the Medicago truncatula genomic euchromatic regions using a BAC based approach...|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) received $ 12. 9 billion in fiscal year 2003 for the Housing Choice Voucher Program, which helps about 2 million low-income families pay rent for privately owned housing. This amount included $ 1. 1 billion in administrative fee payments to the public housing agencies that administer the program for HUD. In the <b>Consolidated</b> Appropriations <b>Resolution</b> of 2003, Congress included provisions to address a concern that housing agencies may have received more in fees than they needed to run the program. Housing agencies were directed to report to HUD their available reserves as of January 31, 2003. HUD was directed to reduce the fees agencies would receive if these levels were too high and recapture some excess fees. The conference report accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004 directed GAO to review compliance with these provisions. This report discusses (1) {{the extent to which}} housing agencies complied with the requirement to report to HUD their available administrative fee reserves as of January 31, 2003; (2) how these reported reserves compared with reserves reported in earlier fiscal years and possible reasons for any declines; (3) the extent to which HUD made required reductions to fiscal year 2003 fees; and (4) the extent to which HUD has recaptured excess fiscal year 2003 administrative fees. ...|$|R

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In 2002, Congress learned that the Palestinian Authority had collected $ 6. 8 million in taxes on U. S. humanitarian assistance meant {{for the people of}} the West Bank and Gaza and subsequently learned that some other foreign governments were also taxing U. S. assistance. U. S. Agency for International Development (USAID) officials estimate that at least several million dollars in taxes are collected annually on U. S. assistance programs, although some of this amount is reimbursed by recipient governments. This situation raised concerns in Congress that U. S. assistance funds for programs to help developing country populations were instead being diverted to the treasuries of foreign governments. In response to these concerns, Congress included a prohibition against such taxation in its <b>Consolidated</b> Appropriations <b>Resolution</b> for fiscal year 2003, and provided for a 200 percent penalty for taxes levied but not reimbursed. This legislation defines "taxes" and "taxation" as value added taxes (VAT) and customs duties imposed on commodities financed with U. S. assistance for programs for which funds are appropriated by the act. This report responds to a requirement in that legislation that we report to the committees on appropriations concerning these provisions. In discussions with staff of the House Appropriations' Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs, we agreed to determine (1) the extent to which USAID bilateral framework agreements or other arrangements include exemption from taxation and (2) the progress that the Department of State has made in developing and distributing guidance to implement the prohibition. ...|$|R
