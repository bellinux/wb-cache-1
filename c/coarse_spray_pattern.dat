50|$|As {{the name}} implies, the <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> {{appears as a}} flat sheet of liquid. The pattern is formed by an {{elliptical}} or a round orifice on a deflective surface that is tangent to the exit orifice. The orifice has an external groove with a contoured internal cylindrical radius, or “cat’s eye” shape. In the elliptical orifice design, the <b>pattern</b> <b>sprays</b> out of the orifice {{in line with the}} pipe. In the deflector design, the <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> is perpendicular to the pipe. There are two categories of flat spray, tapered and even, depending on the uniformity of the spray over the <b>spray</b> <b>pattern.</b> Flat <b>spray</b> <b>patterns</b> with tapering edges are produced by straight-through elliptical spray nozzles. This <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> is useful for overlapping patterns between multiple nozzle headers. The result is uniform distribution across the entire sprayed surface. Non-tapered flat spray nozzles are used in cleaning applications that require a uniform <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> without any overlap in spray area.|$|R

The main objectives were to study the variation of pesticide residue levels in individual fruits versus composite samples, {{and the effect of}} standard fine spray quality application versus <b>coarse</b> <b>spray</b> quality application on residue levels. The applications included boscalid, bupirimate, captan, fenoxycarb, indoxacarb, pirimicarb, pyraclostrobin and thiophanate-methyl. Apples were collected from four zones in the tree and pesticide residues were detected in the individual apples. None of the results for the pesticides residues measured in individual apples exceeded the EU Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs). However, there was a large variation in the residues levels in the apples, with levels from 0. 01 to 1. 4 mg kg- 1 for captan, the pesticide with the highest variation, and from 0. 01 to 0. 2 mg kg- 1 for pyraclostrobin, the pesticide with the lowest variation. Residues of fenoxycarb and indoxacarb were only found in a few apples, probably due to the early application time of these two compounds. The evaluation of the effect of spray quality did not show any major difference between fine and <b>coarse</b> <b>spray</b> quality, except for carbendazim, the degradation product of thiophanate-methyl, where fine spray quality resulted in higher carbendazim residue levels than <b>coarse</b> <b>spray</b> quality. To examine the relationship between individual results and average results from ten apples, 20 composite samples were statistically constructed from sets of ten of the individual results. The variability factors for the individual samples (n = 80) at the 97. 5 percentile were calculated for both standard and air induction nozzle application and were in the range of 0. 9 – 9. 4. The variability factor of seven used when EU member states calculate possible exceeding of Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was adequate to encompass almost all the average results from the analyses of ten individual apples. However, for captan up to 9 % of the results were not covered depending on which of the mathematically constructed composite concentrations was chosen. The variability factor of three, recommend by Codex, seems to be too low, because up to 30 % of the apple samples for captan were not covered if the worst case scenario was chosen.

The percentage increase in flow rate for all tips varied approximately with the square root of the operation time.

40|$|Pesticide {{application}} {{is an integral}} part of crop production and ground-based agricultural boom sprayers are used extensively to apply pesticides to the crop canopy or soil surface across millions of acres in the United States. Efficient {{application is}} necessary to minimize costs and limit adverse environmental impacts. Errors in flow rate and system pressure measurements may cause as-applied maps to incorrectly indicate application rates and could negatively affect downstream data processing or analysis. The goals of this study were to provide quantified measurements on the effects of nozzle setup errors on <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> uniformity and evaluate how laboratory patternator data would compare to measurements on a full spray boom. More specific objectives were to: 1) determine the effects from factors such as nozzle lateral angle, nozzle spacing, nozzle replacement and nozzle pitch angle on <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> distribution, 2) evaluate a simulation approach to predict the effects of single nozzle boom setup errors on full boom system pattern uniformity, and 3) assess full boom operational measurements (e. g., flow, pressure, and <b>spray</b> <b>pattern)</b> to assess sensitivity for predicting boom distribution errors. Laboratory and field-based tests were devised to quantify the impact of nozzle setup and operational errors on <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> uniformity, boom pressure, and nozzle flow rates. Results indicated that small variations in boom setup or nozzle operation (i. e., pressure or flow) can cause significant errors in spray nozzle distribution which may not be completely detectable by measuring <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> alone. Simulations using laboratory data from setup or operational errors reflected similar changes in <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> CV as full boom data with similar setup errors. These findings were significant in that it may be possible to model full boom spray distributions based on smaller laboratory-collected datasets. Finally, full boom system-based pressure and flow measurements were compared with similar values at the boom subsection level. Results indicated that localized issues with nozzles or boom subsections may not be readily detected with system-based measurements. Those relying on system-based readings (e. g., pressure or flow) should expect errors exceeding 10 % compared to localized measurements across the spray boom. Advisor: Joe D. Luc...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Consumption of {{contaminated}} poultry meat {{is still an}} important cause of Salmonella infections in humans. Colonization inhibition (CI) occurs when a live Salmonella strain is administered to chickens and subsequently protects against challenge with an-other Salmonella strain belonging to the same serotype. A Salmonella Enteritidis hilAssrAfliG deletion mutant has previously been proven to reduce colonization and shedding of a wild-type Salmonella Enteritidis strain in newly hatched broilers after experimental infection. In this study, we compared two administration routes for this strain. Administering the Salmonella Enteri-tidis ΔhilAssrAfliG strain through drinking water {{on the first day}} of life resulted in decreased fecal shed-ding and cecal colonization of a wild-type Salmonella Enteritidis challenge strain administered 24 h later us-ing a seeder-bird model. When administering the CI strain by <b>coarse</b> <b>spray</b> on newly hatched broiler chicks, an even more pronounced reduction of cecal coloniza-tion was observed, and fecal shedding of the Salmonella Enteritidis challenge strain ceased during the course of the experiment. These data suggest that administering a Salmonella Enteritidis ΔhilAssrAfliG strain to newly hatched chicks using a <b>coarse</b> <b>spray</b> is a useful and ef-fective method that reduces colonization and shedding of a wild-type Salmonella Enteritidis strain after early challenge...|$|R

40|$|Trials {{were carried}} out {{over a three-year period}} in Oak Park to compare airinduction with {{conventional}} nozzles for weed control in sugar beet. Two makes of low-drift nozzle (Bubble Jet and DriftBETA) were compared with conventional fans. All nozzles were used at a pressure of 3 bar. Two sizes (015 and 03) of each type of nozzle were used, to allow volumes of 110 and 220 litres per hectare to be applied. These nozzles were used to apply two-spray programmes to sugar-beet crops. In four of the weed control trials, tank mixes of products with some residual action (Progress, Goltix, Venzar and Debut) were used. In the other two trials, a contact-only spray (Betanal E) was used. The aim was to see how the nozzles behaved with contact-only sprays as well as those with more complex modes of action. Spray drift was also measured with the size 03 nozzles. Spray drift reductions from 37 % to 64 % were measured when the air-induction nozzles were compared with conventional fans. In general, the tank mix programme gave better weed control than the contact-only treatments. Within programmes, differences between the application methods were significant in two trials. In both of these, the conventional nozzles gave the best results. Looking at the mean results of the tank-mix trials, two trends were suggested: higher water volumes gave slightly better weed control, and the effect of the <b>coarser</b> <b>sprays</b> was slight. With the contact-only sprays, the decline in performance with the <b>coarser</b> <b>sprays</b> was more emphatic, and the lower volumes appeared to give slightly better control. It is concluded that in calm conditions conventional fan or cone nozzles should continue to be used, but that air-induction nozzles are a valuable fall-back when it is necessary to spray in a moderate breeze. In these situations, and with the normal tank-mix programmes, small nozzle sizes applying very low volumes should be avoided. Makes of air-induction nozzle which give very <b>coarse</b> <b>spray</b> should also be avoided. End of Project Repor...|$|R

In {{practical}} terms, the three Es mean the pesticide {{has to do}} a good job controlling the pest while allowing the operation to be fast, inexpensive, and low-drift. Viewed individually, or in groups of two, each of these goals is achievable. But meeting all three together requires compromise. Success relies less on a herbicide’s knockout punch, and more on integrating application with agronomic considerations that help herbicides do their job. For example, perhaps timely application is more important than perfect control; this may mean that <b>coarser</b> <b>sprays,</b> though possibly less effective, provide an overall advantage if they allow sprays to be applied at the right time. Any application approach has to be reconciled with continuing trends in the equipment, such as the use of heavier, faster machines and the need to cover more area in less time. All of these have implications for nozzle selection, because changes in boom height or travel speed affect nozzle performance. A better understanding of these three factors is necessary so that appropriate nozzle, sprayer, or water volume selections can be made.
