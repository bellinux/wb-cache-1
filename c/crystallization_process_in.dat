The impurity effect on the crystal properties, such as particle size and shape distribution, is significant, having {{significant impact on the}} downstream processes {{as well as on the}} product effectiveness. Currently very few studies exist that provide a quantitative model to describe crystal purity resulting from <b>crystallization</b> <b>processes</b> <b>in</b> impure media, and none to take into account the simultaneous effect of multiple impurities. Hence, the understanding of the effect of multiple impurities on <b>crystallization</b> <b>process</b> is important <b>in</b> order to obtain the desired product properties. Batch crystallization of potassium dihydrogen phosphate from aqueous solution in the presence of impurities was investigated experimentally by using an online particle vision and measurement tool with real-time image analysis. A mathematical model to describe the crystal purity and aspect ratio is proposed based on a morphological population balance equation including primary nucleation, growth of characteristic faces and multisite, competitive adsorption of impurities. The model parameters were identified and validated using crystallization experiments in mixtures of two impurities with variable composition. The developed and validated model can be an efficient tool for the investigation of <b>crystallization</b> <b>processes</b> <b>in</b> impure media with multiple impurities. The model can also serve as an effective tool for process and product design or optimization...|$|R

This scaling relation usually takes place for crystallization regimes far from the initial stage t = 0 of the process. We demonstrate that nonstationary <b>crystallization</b> <b>processes</b> <b>in</b> the presence of the mushy region are described by means of the fractal-like power laws at initial and self-similar stages...|$|R

The stochastic modelling part is supplemented by a detailed discussion of the relevant parameters and their dependence upon temperature. In the special case of one-dimensional crystallization a system of partial differential equations describing the evolution of temperature and of the degree of crystallinity is derived. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Crystallization</b> <b>processes</b> <b>in</b> nanophase materials, a form {{of complex}} matter, exhibit {{self-organization}} steps highlighting the importance of nonstandard kinetic and structural factors, and therefore, requires {{a fresh look at}} the nature of their underlying mechanisms. The resulting crystallite size distribution signifies an important departure from the classical one, essentially exponential, and reveals the presence of correlations. The emergence of a characteristic crystal size for this distribution is the signature of the underlying nonlinear kinetics and the nonequilibrium constraints imposed by the initial conditions. The whole process can be elucidated within the framework, insights and conceptual tools, furnished by nonlinear science and complexity. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.
