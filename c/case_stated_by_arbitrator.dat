The hearing before the Administrative Court was adjourned because Mr Haw had not been served with relevant documents in time to give them proper consideration.|$|R
50|$|The {{section in}} the {{relative}} major begins with a theme clearly composed from {{the theme of the}} piano's accompaniment, in this <b>case</b> <b>stated</b> <b>by</b> the violin and viola moving in unison over a piano accompaniment based on the previous broken chordal figure. This briefly exchanges with a cello countermelody. When the violin and viola soar to an unexpectedly high register, the piano interrupts by playing an explosive broken dominant seventh chord. The strings respond by a piano, homophonic, homorythmic theme to be played mezza voce (It: medium voice). This idea is taken directly from the opening string theme of the first movement. Rather than accompanying this theme, the piano plays a descending broken chord after each utterance. The exposition ends in E-flat major, and Brahms indicates that it should be repeated.|$|R

On what grounds can a reasonable man be asked to believe any more? So far as the narrative in the first gospel, on the one hand, and those in the third gospel and the Acts, on the other, go beyond what is stated in the second gospel, they are hopelessly discrepant with one another. And this is the more significant because the pregnant phrase [...] "some doubted," [...] in the first gospel, is ignored in the third.|$|R

Furthermore, the formulation for pure states can be conveniently extended to the <b>case</b> of mixed <b>states</b> <b>by</b> utilizing the kronecker product approximation technique.

50|$|The Seventh Amendment is {{generally}} {{considered one of the}} more straightforward amendments of the Bill of Rights. While the Seventh Amendment's provision for jury trials in civil cases has never been incorporated (i.e., applied to the states) almost every state voluntarily complies with this requirement. The prohibition of overturning a jury's findings of fact applies to federal <b>cases,</b> <b>state</b> <b>cases</b> involving federal law, and to review of <b>state</b> <b>cases</b> <b>by</b> federal courts. United States v. Wonson (1812) established the historical test, which interpreted the amendment as relying on English common law to determine whether a jury trial was necessary in a civil suit. The amendment thus does not guarantee trial by jury in cases under maritime law, in lawsuits against the government itself, and for many parts of patent claims. In all other cases, the jury can be waived by consent of the parties.|$|R
50|$|When an {{arbitrator}} {{looks at}} a discipline dispute, the arbitrator first asks whether the employee's wrongdoing has been proven by the employer, and then asks whether the method of discipline should be upheld or modified.

The concepts encompassed within his seven tests are still frequently used <b>by</b> <b>arbitrators</b> when deciding discipline cases.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, an {{intuitive}} approach is employed to generalize the full separability criterion of tripartite quantum states of qubits to the higher-dimensional systems (Phys. Rev.
