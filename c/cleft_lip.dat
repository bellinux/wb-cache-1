25|$|<b>Cleft</b> <b>lip</b> and cleft palate, {{also known}} as {{orofacial}} cleft, {{is a group of}} conditions that includes <b>cleft</b> <b>lip</b> (CL), cleft palate (CP), and both together (CLP). A <b>cleft</b> <b>lip</b> contains an opening in the upper lip that may extend into the nose. The opening may be on one side, both sides, or in the middle. A cleft palate is when the roof of the mouth contains an opening into the nose. These disorders can result in feeding problems, speech problems, hearing problems, and frequent ear infections. Less than half the time the condition is associated with other disorders.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{correlate}} clinical outcome {{with the}} size and location of clefts in patients with schizencephaly. Patients and Methods: MR scans and clinical records of 20 patients with schizencephaly were retrospectively reviewed. Seven patients had bilateral <b>clefts</b> (10 open <b>lip</b> <b>clefts,</b> 4 closed <b>lip</b> <b>clefts),</b> eight patients had right-sided unilateral <b>clefts</b> (5 open <b>lip</b> <b>clefts,</b> 3 closed <b>lip</b> <b>clefts),</b> and five patients had left-sided unilateral <b>clefts</b> (3 open <b>lip</b> <b>clefts,</b> 2 closed <b>lip</b> <b>clefts).</b> Results: Statistically significant correlations were found as follows: Patients with bilateral schizen-cephalies had significantly worse intellectual (P =. 004) and speech (P =. 03) development than those with unilateral clefts; patients with unilateral large or medium open lip schizencephalies had significantly worse motor (P =. 003) and intellectual (P =. 008) impairment than those with unilateral closed lip or small open-lip schizencephalies; patients with frontal lobe involvement had a significantly higher incidence of motor dysfunction than those without frontal lobe involvement (P =. 01). Strong similarities were noted in the patient outcomes and the locations of cortical anomalies of patients with schizencephaly and those with nonschizencephaly focal cortical dysplasias.
