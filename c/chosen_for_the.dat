5|$|Allen {{was free}} to play {{regularly}} for Middlesex in 1924. The team {{was involved in a}} close race for the County Championship with Yorkshire, and Allen had several successful matches. He ended the season with 568 runs at 21.84 and 50 wickets at 17.48. Playing less often in 1925, he scored 392 runs, took 39 wickets, and scored his maiden first-class century in the Gentlemen v Players match at the Oval. He was also <b>chosen</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time to represent the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord's, where he scored 52, and his reputation grew steadily. By the beginning of the 1926 season, he and fellow fast bowler Harold Larwood were tipped in the press to be <b>chosen</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> England team against Australia that summer. Allen began well for Middlesex but was less successful in a trial match to help choose the England team. Larwood was <b>chosen</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Test series; Allen was not. In county cricket, Allen scored his first century for Middlesex, and began to open the bowling occasionally, having been the third or fourth bowler in previous seasons. Overall, he scored 771 runs, the highest seasonal aggregate of his career, at an average of 29.65 and took 44 wickets at 28.27.|$|E
