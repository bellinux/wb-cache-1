5|$|On January 25, 2017, Baker {{proposed}} a $40.5 billion state budget {{for fiscal year}} 2018, and on March 9, 2017, legislative hearings began to review it. Tax changes proposed in Baker's 2018 budget proposal include extending the state sales tax to online retailers without physical storefronts or offices in-state, a requirement that credit <b>card</b> <b>companies</b> send a 1099 tax form to individuals earning more than $600 from credit and debit card transactions, extending the state's hotel tax to room-sharing services and individuals who rent out rooms for more than 150 days a year, and a $2,000-per-employee assessment on employers that do not offer health insurance to counter spending growth in the state Medicaid program, MassHealth. Spending increases to MassHealth, local government and local education aid, higher education (including $78 million towards repairs of the University of Massachusetts Boston underground parking garage), an anti-opioid trafficking program and substance abuse services, homelessness prevention, improvement in clinical services at Bridgewater State Hospital, the Department of Children and Families to hire more case workers, a job retraining fund, an MBTA subsidy, and increasing state tax credits to businesses that hire unemployed military veterans {{are included in the}} proposal.|$|E
25|$|In the U.S., the Credit CARD Act of 2009 {{specifies}} {{that credit}} <b>card</b> <b>companies</b> must send cardholders a notice 45 {{days before they}} can increase or change certain fees. This includes annual fees, cash advance fees, and late fees.|$|E

25|$|Merchants in the United States {{have been}} {{fighting}} what {{they consider to be}} unfairly high fees charged by credit <b>card</b> <b>companies</b> in a series of lawsuits that started in 2005. Merchants charged that the two main credit card processing companies, MasterCard and Visa, used their monopoly power to levy excessive fees in a class-action lawsuit involving the National Retail Federation and major retailers such as Wal-Mart. In December 2013, a federal judge approved a $5.7 billion settlement in the case that offered payouts to merchants who had paid credit card fees, the largest antitrust settlement in U.S. history. Some large retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Amazon, chose to not participate in this settlement, however, and have continued their legal fight against the credit <b>card</b> <b>companies.</b>|$|E

25|$|All major Australian banks offer {{credit cards}} with reward programs. Many are linked {{directly}} to airline rewards {{programs such as}} the Qantas Frequent Flyer program or Virgin Australia's Velocity Frequent Flyer program.

50|$|Nintendo was {{originally}} a playing <b>card</b> <b>company</b> in Kyoto. In 1958, Nintendo's then president Hiroshi Yamauchi visited the U.S. Playing <b>Card</b> <b>Company's</b> office and factory. He {{was shocked at}} the humble size of the office, despite USPCC being the top selling playing <b>card</b> <b>company</b> nationally in the U.S and also worldwide. Yamauchi understood Nintendo's limited potential if it continued to operate only in the playing card business, and so he famously began to diversify away from playing cards into other types of gaming.|$|R

Acquisitions continued throughout its history: Andrew Dougherty in 1907 (adding Tally-Ho), Russell Playing Card Co. in 1929, Heraclio Fournier, S.A in 1986, Arrco (formerly Arrow) Playing <b>Card</b> <b>Company</b> in 1987, Hoyle Products in 2001, and finally KEM Playing Cards in 2004. In 1930, USPCC subsidiaries Consolidated Card Co., Standard Playing Card Co., and Andrew Dougherty are merged into Consolidated-Dougherty which continues to produce cards from all three brands including Bee and Tally-Ho.|$|R
50|$|The {{second major}} {{component}} of the city ledger are credit card accounts.

25|$|Advocates of BAPCPA {{claimed that}} its passage would reduce losses to {{creditors}} such as credit <b>card</b> <b>companies,</b> {{and that those}} creditors would then pass on the savings to other borrowers {{in the form of}} lower interest rates. Critics assert that these claims turned out to be false, observing that although credit card company losses decreased after passage of the Act, prices charged to customers increased, and credit card company profits soared.|$|E
25|$|In August 2008, it was {{reported}} by The Consumerist that Discovery Channel had preempted an episode of MythBusters examining RFID security in regard to its implementation in credit cards before its original broadcast because the episode would upset credit <b>card</b> <b>companies,</b> who are major advertisers on Discovery Channel. It was later determined that {{the decision not to}} investigate the issue was made by Beyond Productions, the MythBusters production company, and was not made by Discovery Channel or their advertising department.|$|E
25|$|Many credit <b>card</b> <b>companies</b> will also, when {{applying}} {{payments to}} a card, do so, for {{the matter at}} hand, {{at the end of}} a billing cycle, and apply those payments to everything before cash advances. For this reason, many consumers have large cash balances, which have no grace period and incur interest at a rate that is (usually) higher than the purchase rate, and will carry those balances for years, even if they pay off their statement balance each month.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{credit card}} {{is a common}} form of credit. With a credit card, the credit <b>card</b> <b>company,</b> often a bank, grants {{a line of credit}} to the {{cardholder}}. The cardholder can make purchases from merchants, and borrow the money for these purchases from the credit <b>card</b> <b>company.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} for a consumer to imitate the methods of professional debt settlement companies and many people report success in negotiating a debt settlement for themselves. Initiation of negotiations can begin by calling the customer service department of the credit <b>card</b> <b>company.</b> In general, the credit <b>card</b> <b>company</b> will only deal with a consumer when the consumer is behind on payments but capable of making a lump sum payment. A payment plan is not an option; the credit <b>card</b> <b>company</b> will demand that the consumer make a lump sum payment of the settlement amount.|$|R
50|$|A {{transaction}} fee is a commission earned by the credit <b>card</b> <b>company</b> earning one's business {{and is a}} direct transfer of money from the user to the credit <b>card</b> <b>company.</b> This varies from (typically) 1-5% of transferred debt - sometimes with a maximum capped amount, but otherwise an uncapped percentage.|$|R
25|$|Banks {{also face}} {{a host of}} other {{challenges}} such as ageing ownership groups. Across the country, many banks’ management teams and board of directors are ageing. Banks also face ongoing pressure by shareholders, both public and private, to achieve earnings and growth projections. Regulators place added pressure on banks to manage the various categories of risk. Banking is also an extremely competitive industry. Competing in the financial services industry has become tougher with the entrance of such players as insurance agencies, credit unions, cheque cashing services, credit <b>card</b> <b>companies,</b> etc.|$|E
25|$|Credit {{card debt}} has {{increased}} steadily. Since the late 1990s, lawmakers, consumer advocacy groups, college officials and other higher education affiliates {{have become increasingly}} concerned about the rising use of credit cards among college students. The major credit <b>card</b> <b>companies</b> {{have been accused of}} targeting a younger audience, especially college students, many of whom are already in debt with college tuition fees and college loans and who typically are less experienced at managing their own finances. Credit card debt may also negatively affect their grades as they are likely to work more both part and full-time positions.|$|E
25|$|Another {{controversial}} area is {{the trailing}} interest issue. Trailing interest is the practice of charging interest on the entire bill no matter what percentage of it is paid. US Senator Carl Levin {{raised the issue of}} millions of Americans affected by hidden fees, compounding interest and cryptic terms. Their woes were heard in a Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations hearing which was chaired by Senator Levin, who said that he intends to keep the spotlight on credit <b>card</b> <b>companies</b> and that legislative action may be necessary to purge the industry. In 2009, the C.A.R.D. Act was signed into law, enacting protections for many of the issues Levin had raised.|$|E

25|$|The {{fact that}} credit <b>card</b> <b>companies</b> {{can change the}} {{interest}} rate on debts that were incurred when a different rate of interest was in place is similar to adjustable rate mortgages where interest rates on current debt may rise. However, in both cases, this is agreed to in advance, and is a trade off that allows a lower initial rate {{as well as the}} possibility of an even lower rate (mortgages, if interest rates fall) or perpetually keeping a below-market rate (credit cards, if the user makes their debt payments on time). The universal default practice was encouraged by federal regulators, particularly those at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), as a means of managing the changing risk profiles of cardholders.|$|E
25|$|Gingrich {{has argued}} the first {{priority}} for immigration reform is tighter border control. He has pushed for Congress to pass a narrowly written emergency border bill to finish the border fence between the United States and Mexico {{in less than a}} year and have complete border control within two years. In addition to greater border control, Gingrich has advocated for measures to discourage the hiring and harboring of illegal immigrants, such as shifting Internal Revenue Service resources to audit companies that employ illegal immigrants and cutting off federal aid to cities, counties or states that refuse to enforce immigration laws. He has frequently argued for using credit <b>card</b> <b>companies</b> to develop identification cards and a real-time system to verify citizenship.|$|E
25|$|Nearly all {{legitimate}} {{e-mail messages}} from companies {{to their customers}} contain an item of information that is not readily available to phishers. Some companies, for example PayPal, always address their customers by their username in emails, so if an email addresses the recipient in a generic fashion ("Dear PayPal customer") {{it is likely to}} be an attempt at phishing. Furthermore, PayPal offers various methods to determine spoof emails and advises users to forward suspicious emails to their spoof@PayPal.com domain to investigate and warn other customers. Emails from banks and credit <b>card</b> <b>companies</b> often include partial account numbers. However, recent research has shown that the public do not typically distinguish between the first few digits and the last few digits of an account number—a significant problem since the first few digits are often the same for all clients of a financial institution.|$|E

25|$|In {{relative}} numbers {{the values}} lost in bank card fraud are minor, calculated in 2006 at 7 cents per 100 {{dollars worth of}} transactions (7 basis points). In 2004, in the UK, the cost of fraud was over £500 million. When a card is stolen, or an unauthorized duplicate made, most card issuers will refund {{some or all of}} the charges that the customer has received for things they did not buy. These refunds will, in some cases, be at the expense of the merchant, especially in mail order cases where the merchant cannot claim sight of the card. In several countries, merchants will lose the money if no ID card was asked for, therefore merchants usually require ID card in these countries. Credit <b>card</b> <b>companies</b> generally guarantee the merchant will be paid on legitimate transactions regardless of whether the consumer pays their credit card bill.|$|E
25|$|Merchants that accept {{credit cards}} must pay {{interchange}} fees and discount fees on all credit-card transactions. In some cases merchants are barred by their credit agreements from passing these fees directly to credit card customers, or from setting a minimum transaction amount (no longer prohibited in the United States, United Kingdom or Australia). The {{result is that}} merchants are induced to charge all customers (including {{those who do not}} use credit cards) higher prices to cover the fees on credit card transactions. The inducement can be strong because the merchant's fee is a percentage of the sale price, which has a disproportionate effect on the profitability of businesses that have predominantly credit card transactions, unless compensated for by raising prices generally. In the United States in 2008 credit <b>card</b> <b>companies</b> collected a total of $48 billion in interchange fees, or an average of $427 per family, with an average fee rate of about 2% per transaction.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2009, Dodd was {{the author}} and lead sponsor of the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act of 2009, which {{was signed into law}} by President Barack Obama on May 22, 2009. The law {{requires}} <b>card</b> <b>companies</b> give cardholders 45 days notice of any interest rate increases, prevents <b>card</b> <b>companies</b> from retroactively increasing interest rates on the existing balance of a cardholder in good standing for reasons unrelated to the cardholder's behavior with that card, and prohibits <b>card</b> <b>companies</b> from arbitrarily changing the terms of their contract with a cardholder, banning the so-called practice of [...] "any-time, any-reason repricing." [...] Also included in the bill were provisions requiring companies to give cardholders time to pay their bills by requiring <b>card</b> <b>companies</b> to mail billing statements 25 calendar days before the due date and individuals under the age of 21 to either show income or have a co-signer in order to obtain a credit card. In a conference call with reporters after the bill was signed, Dodd stated his intention to continue work on capping credit card interest rates at thirty percent and to establish limits on fees that merchants pay when a customer uses a credit card for a purchase.|$|E
