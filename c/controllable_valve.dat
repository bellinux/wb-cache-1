With Sensotronic Brake Control electric impulses are used to pass the driver’s braking commands onto a microcomputer which processes various sensor signals simultaneously and, depending on the particular driving situation, calculates the optimum brake pressure for each wheel. As a result, SBC offers even greater active safety than conventional brake systems when braking in a corner or on a slippery surface.

Mechanical valving is similar to a complex plumbing system because the microfabricated fluidic channels act as the plumbing pipes while the various <b>controllable</b> <b>valves</b> direct the fluid. Mechanical valving is also considered to be the most robust solution to the disadvantages of the electrokinetic manipulation and vesicle encapsulation, since the mechanical valves operate completely independent from the fluid's physical and chemical properties. Because the physical properties that make up the microfabricated fluidic channels and mechanical valves are difficult to process due to the system's extremely small scale, this technique has a disadvantage of creating an integrated nanoliter system with mechanical valving to the nanoliter scale.|$|R

For the WEC investigated {{the diameter of the}} cylindrical buoy is 3. 3 m and the cylinder ends are, at equilibrium, 3. 1 m below mean water level and 2. 0 m above. The plate has diameter 8. 0 m, is 0. 2 m thick and is submerged 10 m. The geometry is chosen so that the heave excitation forces on the two bodies are approximately equal in magnitude, but in opposite direction, for wave periods we want to absorb energy from. A high-pressure hydraulic machinery is proposed for energy production and motion control. A valve in the machinery can be actively controlled, and it is used to obtain largest possible power production, and to limit the excursion of the buoy, {{in order to protect the}} hydraulic machinery.

40|$|Many of {{mechanical}} energy absorbers utilized in engineering structures are hydraulic dampers, {{since they are}} simple and highly efficient and have favourable volume to load capacity ratio. However, there exist fields of applications where a threat of toxic contamination with the hydraulic fluid contents must be avoided, for example, food or pharmacy industries. A solution here can be a Pneumatic Adaptive Absorber (PAA), which {{is characterized by a}} high dissipation efficiency and an inactive medium. In order to properly analyse the characteristics of a PAA, an adequate mathematical model is required. This paper proposes a concept for mathematical modelling of a PAA with experimental verification.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis is generated {{in the frame of}} the project â€œMicro and Miniaturized Flow Controller for Gas Chromatographyï¿½? financially supported by the Dutch Technology Foundation (STW). The aim of the project is to develop a miniature instrument for the control of gas flow known as flow controller. An important application of the flow controller is gas chromatography. Gas chromatography is a method for separating substances in a mixture and measuring the relative quantities of substances. It is a useful technique for substances that do not decompose at high temperatures and when a very small quantity of sample (micrograms) is available. Since there is a strong trend to miniaturize these systems as small systems use small amounts of materials and smaller samples for analysis, small flow controllers are demanded. Flow controllers are comprised of controllable valves, flow sensors and control electronics. The research subject in this project is directed mainly to miniature valve, which currently forms the bottleneck {{in the development of the}} miniature flow controller. In this thesis a new design of a valve is proposed, which has the attractive feature that no power is required to keep the valve at a freely chosen position. To achieve the aforesaid objective to realize a <b>controllable</b> <b>valve</b> with no power consumption to keep the valve at a freely chosen position, a combination of micromachining and conventional fine machining is explored...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2010 Micro scale {{systems are}} being {{utilized}} {{in a wide}} variety of chemical, biological and heat exchanger applications, but suffer from the development of vapor bubbles inside the microchannels due to convective boiling, leading to decreases in system performance. In this work, a simulation-based control strategy is employed to eliminate flow maldistribution in parallel microchannels. System identification techniques are utilized to produce a reduced-order, input-output model that captures the essential dynamics of the full nonlinear flow, in terms of a relationship between the valve angles and the exit flow rate for each channel. The resulting linear model is subsequently incorporated into a model predictive control scheme to identify flow maldistribution from exit flow velocities and prescribe actuation of the channel valves to clear blockages and effectively redistribute the flow. Computational fluid dynamics simulations of a microchannel geometry consisting of three channels with <b>controllable</b> <b>valves</b> was used to investigate both the predictive performance of the reduced order model as well as the ability of the controller to clear bubble disturbances. Flow simulations illustrated the effectiveness of the control design, which quickly and efficiently varied channel valves to clear a single bubble from the channel and equalize flow rates. While the controller was successful in regulating flow and dealing with single bubble disturbances, future work is required in effectively handling blockages in multiple channels simultaneously...|$|R
40|$|Stable isotope {{signatures}} {{provide an}} integral fingerprint of origin, flow paths, transport processes, and residence times {{of water in}} the environment. However, the full potential of stable isotopes to quantitatively characterize subsurface water dynamics is yet unfolded due to the difficulty in obtaining extensive, detailed, and repeated measurements of pore water in the unsaturated and saturated zone. This paper presents a functional and cost-efficient system for non-destructive continual in situ monitoring of pore water stable isotope signatures with high resolution. Automatic <b>controllable</b> <b>valve</b> arrays are used to continuously extract diluted water vapor in soil air via a branching network of small microporous probes into a commercial laser-based isotope analyzer. Normalized liquid-phase isotope signatures are then obtained based on a specific on-site calibration approach along with basic corrections for instrument bias and temperature dependent isotopic fractionation. The system was applied to sample depth profiles on three experimental plots with varied vegetation cover in southwest Germany. Two methods (i. e., based on advective versus diffusive vapor extraction) and two modes of sampling (i. e., using multiple permanently installed probes versus a single repeatedly inserted probe) were tested and compared. The results show that the isotope distribution along natural profiles could be resolved with sufficiently high accuracy and precision at sampling intervals of less than four minutes. The presented in situ approaches may thereby be used interchangeably {{with each other and with}} concurrent laboratory-based direct equilibration measurements of destructively collected samples. It is thus found that the introduced sampling techniques provide powerful tools towards a detailed quantitative understanding of dynamic and heterogeneous shallow subsurface and vadose zone processes...|$|E

40|$|Recent years {{advances}} within well deployment and instrumentation {{technology offers}} huge potentials for increased oil recovery from reservoir production. Wells {{can now be}} equipped with <b>controllable</b> <b>valves</b> at reservoir depth, which may possibly alter the production profitability of the field completely, if the devices are used in an intelligent manner. This thesis investigates this potential by using model predictive control to maximize reservoir production performance and total oil production. The report describes an algorithm for nonlinear model predictive control, using a single shooting, multistep, quasi-Newton method, and implements it on an existing industrial MPC platform - Statoil's in-house MPC tool SEPTIC. The method is an iterative method, solving a series of quadratic problems analogous to sequential quadratic programming, to find the optimal control settings. An interface between SEPTIC and a commercial reservoir simulator, ECLIPSE, is developed for process modelling and predictions. ECLIPSE provides highly realistic and detailed reservoir behaviour and is used by SEPTIC to obtain numerical gradients for optimization. The method is applied to two reservoir examples, Case 1 and Case 2, and develops optimal control strategies for each of these. The two examples have conceptually different model structures. Case 1 is a simple introduction model. Case 2 is a benchmark model previously used in Yeten, Durlofsky and Aziz (2002) and models a North Sea type channelized reservoir. It is described {{by a set of}} different realizations, to capture a notion of model uncertainty. The report addresses each of the available realizations and shows how the value of an optimal production strategy can vary for equally probable realizations. Improvements in reservoir production performance using the model predictive control method are shown for all cases, compared to basic controlled references cases. For the benchmark example improvements range up to as much as 68 % increase in one realization, and 30 % on average for all realizations. This is an increase from the results previously published for the benchmark, with a 3 % average. However, the level of improvement shows significant variation, and is only marginal for example Case 1. A thorough field analysis should therefore be performed before deciding to take the extra cost of well equipment and optimal control. </p...|$|R

40|$|High density {{magnetic}} recording, magnetic {{random access}} memories, displacement and current detection, contactless switching and electronic compass applications all require magnetic field sensors with unprecedented sensitivity. The spin-valve effect (giant magnetoresistance) found in 1988 in magnetic metallic multilayers provided {{a new form}} of magnetoresistance with promising possibilities. The name indicates its physical origin: the magnetic layers form magnetic field <b>controllable</b> <b>valves</b> for electrons with parallel spins, leading to low resistance under application of a magnetic field. The resistance is usually measured using a four point technique, with the current in plane. Now, ten years later, the first hard disk incorporating this effect has reached the marketplace. Its read head shows a spin-valve effect of about 5 % allowing for a capacity of 16. 8 Gbyte. The use of the much larger perpendicular spin-valve effect was limited because of the ultra low perpendicular resistance of the atomically thin multilayers. Subject of this thesis is the spin valve transistor, which we introduced 1995. It is able to circumvent the low resistance dilemma by its direct mean free path dependence in the output. In the spin valve transistor a spin-valve multilayer serves as a base region of an n-silicon metal base transistor structure: via an emitter barrier hot electrons are injected into the spin-valve, a collector barrier accepts only non-scattered electrons by means of its angle and energy selectivity. Since the number of collected electrons depends exponentially on the spin dependent mean free path in the spin-valve base, and since the mean free path changes with field due to the perpendicular spin-valve effect, the collector current change with magnetic field is much larger than the resistance change in current-in-plane measurements and can be effectively used for magnetic field detection. Since the electron energy of the injected electrons can be varied either using different Schottky barriers or bias variation using a tunnel emitter, the spin-valve transistor allows electron spectroscopy to be performed in spin-valves. Because the electron energy range is of the same order as the spin-split 3 d bands of the ferromagnetic metals Co, Fe and Ni, a direct investigation of the spin-dependent band structure which causes the spin-valve effect is possible. An extension of the two channel model has been formulated, showing that the collector current change can be extremely large, for example, implementation of a 5 % spin-valve (measured in plane) may lead to practically useful output current variations of more than 500 %. Moreover, thickness variation e. g. using wedges, allows determination of spin dependent mean free paths...|$|R

In earlier papers, an effective Structural Health Monitoring solution was presented to detect fatigue cracks in additive manufactured components. Small subsurface capillaries are embedded in the structure and pressurized (vacuum or overpressure). A crack that initiated at the component’s surface will propagate towards the capillary and finally breach it. One capillary suffices to inspect a large area of the component, which makes it interesting to locate the crack {{on the basis of the}} pressure measurements. Negative pressure waves (NPW) arise from the abrupt encounter of high pressure fluid with low pressure fluid and can serve as a basis to locate the crack.

In an attempt to address this, <b>Controllable</b> Radiator <b>Valves</b> (CRVs) are becoming an increasingly popular domestic technology {{with the ability to}} allow previously unrealisable control schemes to operate the traditional central heating system with minimal mechanical modification. Following previous reported work, therefore, this paper presents a new family of Recursive Modelling Model Predictive Controllers (RM-MPCs) for use with low cost thermic CRVs. The ability of the presented control methodologies to maintain superior temperature regulation despite the use of oversized heat emitters, is a key contribution of the paper. Furthermore, unlike previously reported techniques, the underlying recursive modelling method has been reformulated so that traditional parameter matching calculations do not now require a computationally intensive curve fitting stage.

Such a microfluidic device has advantages that allow its use in various fields, including physical, chemical, and biochemical analyses and syntheses. However, it is inefficient and difficult to integrate the large-scale all-glass valves in a microfluidic device using conventional glass fabrication methods, especially for the through-hole fabrication step. Therefore, we have developed a fabrication method for the large-scale integration of all-glass valves in a microfluidic device that contains 110 individually <b>controllable</b> diaphragm <b>valve</b> units on a 30 mm × 70 mm glass slide.

As a generic tool, microfluidics can be presented as the science of regulation, controlling the transport of matter, delivering reagents for reactions occurring on-chip.

The domain of microfluidic is situated between the nanofluidic’s and the millifluidic’s ones, and concerns devices whose critical dimension lies between 50 nm and 200 μm. The work in this thesis realised the development of a device engineered to facilitate the implementation of a microfluidic calibration platform which will, in future, have applications in chip structures such as the laboratory-ina-pill (LIAP). To introduce pump and valve, it is presented the fabrication of a <b>controllable</b> microfluidic <b>valve</b> coupled with an electrochemical pump which have been designed to deliver stored reagent to an integrated biosensing system. The on-chip valve can build up a flow back pressure of several kPa, efficient to store solutions. Novel fabricated material reported here, show reversible and tuneable superhydrophobic surfaces using a combination of epoxy-based resist SU- 8 and spin-on silicon elastomer. The biocompatibility of this new material was also tested showing promising properties applied in tissue engineering. Microfluidic actuators are usually based on the initiation of a transport mechanism based on convection within the system (using a mechanical structure, phase change, and the generation of external forces). Many researches were conducted upon using large voltage supplies and or significant power consumption. The electrolysis of water (involving phase change) was chosen as the source of forced convection within the microfluidic channel. Flow rates in such miniaturised devices range between nL. min- 1 and μL. min- 1 depending on the applied voltage for electrolysis.

These cutting knives could be controlled manually from the engine room. From these cutting knives, the current was transferred to the oil-cooled transformer over a lightning protection inductor and the oil-propelled main switch. The transformer was located in the center of the locomotive body. On the high voltage side, the transformer was switchable for either 15,000 V or 7500 V. This arrangement was necessary since the SBB decided to supply the Gotthard railway line at start only with 7500 V because the main operation was still steam. The SBB was considering that the carbon black on the insulators of the catenary could lead to shortcuts when very high voltage was used. The low-voltage side of the transformer was bifid and equipped with 11 taps. The two camshaft switches were mounted in longitudinal direction on both sides of the transformer. It was possible - as at the Be 3/5 12201 - to select 23 steps. For handling the step switches, the locomotive driver had to turn a vertical crank handle once for each step. It was possible to shut off power by running down both step switches with a special handle. If one step switch failed it could be separated. With the remaining one it was possible to continue the trip with the 12 steps of the other one. The four pneumatic controlled reverse switches were placed on the motors.

40|$|A {{miniature}} {{latching valve}} has been invented {{to satisfy a}} need for an electrically <b>controllable</b> on/off pneumatic <b>valve</b> that is lightweight and compact and remains in the most recently commanded open or closed state when power is not supplied. The valve includes a poppet that is moved into or out of contact with a seat to effect closure or opening, respectively, of the flow path. Motion of the poppet is initiated by electrical heating of one of two opposing pairs of nickel/titanium shape-memory alloy (SMA) wires above their transition temperature: heated wires contract to their remembered length, applying tension to pull the poppet toward or away from the seat. A latch consisting mainly of a bistable Belleville washer (a conical spring) made of a hardened stainless steel operates between two stable positions corresponding to the fully closed or fully open state, holding the poppet {{in one of these}} positions when power is not applied to either pair of SMA wires. To obtain maximum actuation force and displacement, the SMA wires must be kept in tension. The mounting fixtures at the ends of the wires must support large tensile stresses without creating stress concentrations that would limit the fatigue lives of the wires. An earlier design provided for each wire to be crimped in a conical opening with a conical steel ferrule that was swaged into the opening to produce a large, uniformly distributed holding force. In a subsequent design, the conical ferrule was replaced with a larger crimped cylindrical ferrule depicted in the figure. A major problem in designing the valve was to protect the SMA wires from a bake-out temperature of 300 C. The problem was solved by incorporating the SMA wires into an actuator module that is inserted into a barrel of the valve body and is held in place by miniature clip rings...|$|R

This Kingston <b>valve,</b> <b>controllable</b> both {{manually}} and hydraulically, is known {{by some as}} main vent operating gear. Main ballast tanks are in pairs, {{one on each side}} of the boat. One Kingston valve serves a pair, but each tank has a vent riser, with air connections and stop valves in the vent riser. The tank bottom is open to the sea through flood ports. The trapped air in the tank provides positive buoyancy while on the surface, although sea water sloshing in through the flood ports must be removed occasionally from the ballast tank(s) when cruising on the surface by means of low pressure air. The tank is capped by a vent riser, a pipe coming out of the top of the tank that terminates at a Kingston valve. In the vent riser is a valve that when shut, prevents flooding the tank when the submarine is rigged for surface. When the sub is rigged for dive, this valve is opened and flooding the tank becomes an option. Normally, the tank is flooded when the Kingston valve is opened, usually hydraulically from the control room. This Kingston valve then is left open until time to surface comes. This is because a slight leak of air from the air line provided to blow the tank into the vent riser could slowly make the boat more buoyant. When surfacing, the Kingston valve gets shut so the introduced air gets trapped in the tank and pushes the water out the tank's bottom through the flood port. The Kingston valve associated with each ballast tank can be operated manually. The vent riser valves get opened or shut manually during the rig for surface or rig for dive procedure.|$|R
40|$|Dryland soil {{salinity}} {{is a major}} problem throughout much of the northern Great Plains region. One method of controlling dryland salinity is through the use of subsurface drainage systems. However, in western Canada there is a general lack of experience in designing drainage systems. Usually those systems that are installed in semiarid dryland areas are based on experiences from more humid or irrigated areas. This study evaluates two types of subsurface drainage systems installed in adjacent, similar saline seeps located near Swift Current, Saskatchewan. The two types of drainage systems evaluated are: (1) a traditional grid drainage design, typical of humid or irrigated regions and; (2) an experimental drainage design that uses a relatively smaller amount of tubing that is precisely placed and is <b>valve</b> <b>controllable,</b> allowing for the implementation of a water management plan. The two systems were evaluated based on their ability to control water tables, lower {{soil salinity}}, and provide the highest water quality possible so that the environmental impacts associated with re-using or discharging that water are minimized. Climatic, hydrologic, geologic and chemical data were used to characterize each saline parcel and then monitor hydrologic changes caused by the drainage systems. From the results presented in this study, there was evidence that, with modifications to the water management plan, the experimental system would be equally effective at lowering water tables as the traditional system. The study was inconclusive as to which drainage technology had the better ability to reduce soil salinity above the drain lines. Also, the salinity of the experimental drainage system effluent was observed to be much lower than that of the traditional system. Overall, both systems performed as they were designed indicating that both technologies can be successfully used in a dryland situation. However, in consideration of the reduced cost and installation effort and the more flexible operation options of the experimental system, the experimental design concept is perhaps better suited to modern agriculture on the semiarid prairies. Recommendations for use of this technology include adaptations to the water management plan that would further minimize salinization hazards...|$|R
40|$|With the {{new advancements}} in the {{vibration}} control strategies and controllable actuator manufacturing, the semi-active actuators (dampers) are {{finding their way}} as {{an essential part of}} vibration isolators, particularly in vehicle suspension systems. This is attributed to the fact that in a semi-active system, the damping coefficients can be adjusted to improve ride comfort and road handling performances. The currently available semi-active damper technologies can be divided into two main groups. The first uses <b>controllable</b> electromagnetic <b>valves.</b> The second uses magnetorheological (MR) fluid to control the damping characteristics of the system. Leading automotive companies such as General Motors and Volvo have started to use semi-active actuators in the suspension systems of high-end automobiles, such as the Cadillac Seville and Corvette, to improve the handling and ride performance in the vehicle. But much more research and development is needed in design, fabrication, and control of semi-active suspension systems and many challenges must be overcome in this area. Particularly in the area of heavy vehicle systems, such as light armored vehicles, little related research has been done, and there exists no commercially available controllable damper suitable for the relatively high force and large displacement requirements of such application. As the first response to these requirements, this thesis describes the design and modeling of an in-house semi-active twin-tube shock absorber with an internal variable solenoid-actuated valve. A full-scale semi-active damper prototype is developed and the shock absorber is tested to produce the required forcing range. The test results are compared with results of the developed mathematical model. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the semi-active suspension controlled systems and evaluate the performance of those systems, using perturbation techniques this thesis provides a detailed nonlinear analysis of the semi-active systems and establishes the issue of nonlinearity in on-off semi-active controlled systems. Despite different semi-active control methods and the type of actuators used in a semi-active controlled system, one important practical aspect of all hydro-mechanical computer controlled systems is the response-time. The longest response-time is usually introduced by the actuator –in this case, controllable actuator – in the system. This study investigates the effect of response-time in a semi-active controlled suspension system using semi-active dampers. Numerical simulations and analytical techniques are deployed to investigate the issue. The performance of the system due to the response-time is then analyzed and discussed. Since the introduction of the semi-active control strategy, the challenge was to develop methods to effectively use the capabilities of semi-active devices. In this thesis, two semi-active control strategies are proposed. The first controller to be proposed is a new hybrid semi-active control strategy based on the conventional Rakheja-Sankar (R-S) semi-active control to provide better ride-handling quality for vehicle suspension systems as well as industrial vibration isolators. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new strategy, the analytical method of averaging and the numerical analysis method are deployed. In addition, a one-degree-of-freedom test bed equipped with a semi-active magnetorheological (MR) damper is developed. The tests are performed using the MATLAB XPC-target to guarantee the real-time implementation of the control algorithm. The second controller is an intelligent fuzzy logic controller system to optimize the suspension performance. The results from this intelligent system are compared with those of several renowned suspension control methods such as Skyhook. It is shown that the proposed controller can enhance concurrently the vehicle handling and ride comfort, while consuming less energy than existing control methodologies. The key goal of this thesis is to employ the existing knowledge of the semi-active systems together with the new ideas to develop a semi-active suspension system. At the same time, development of an experimental simulation system for real-time control of an experimental test bed is considered. To achieve its goals and objectives, this research study combines and utilizes the numerical simulations and analytical methods, as well as lab-based experimental works. The challenge in this research study is to identify practical and industrial problems and develop proper solutions to those problems using viable scientific approaches...|$|R
