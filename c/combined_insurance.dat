25|$|Before the Caesars jump Knievel {{asked his}} friend Matt Tonning, a <b>Combined</b> <b>Insurance</b> sales agent, {{to sell him}} ten {{accident}} policies. Combined's underwriting policies allowed for {{only one of these}} policies to be written, since the policy covered any accident and was non-cancelable {{for the life of the}} insured. Tonning agreed and was fired by Combined when Knievel filed the claims on all ten. Upon hearing that Tonning had been fired, Knievel contacted Combined's Vice President Matt Walsh. He agreed to return nine of the policies and be paid full benefits on only one, if Combined allowed Tonning to return to work. Walsh agreed and Tonning was reinstated.|$|E
25|$|After {{returning}} home to the west from Washington, DC, Knievel decided to stop committing crimes. He joined the motocross circuit and had moderate success, but he still could not {{make enough money to}} support his family. During 1962, Knievel broke his collarbone and shoulder in a motocross accident. The doctors said he could not race for at least six months. To help support his family, he switched careers and sold insurance for the <b>Combined</b> <b>Insurance</b> Company of America, working for W. Clement Stone. Stone suggested that Knievel read Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude, a book that Stone wrote with Napoleon Hill. Knievel credited much of his later success to Stone and his book.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} advantageous {{selection in}} {{automobile liability insurance}} from the approach with hidden action, which argues that the individual’s private information on his own characteristics will affect his decision on the investment on precautionary effort (hidden action) to reduce the loss probability and further results in a negative relationship between coverage and loss probability in equilibrium. We argue that individual’s vehicle maintenance record could be a proper proxy for the precautionary effort. By <b>combining</b> <b>insurance</b> data from an insurance company and maintenance data from the largest car manufacturer in Taiwan, we demonstrate advantageous selection in automobile liability insurance in Taiwan...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to build a bridge between the {{traditional}} methods of looking at financial risk and insurance risk. Currently, many regulatory and internal company models are attempting to <b>combine</b> <b>insurance</b> risk into a VAR modeling structure. VAR models view insurance related risk differently than the traditional actuarial models since risk is defined as the one-year fluctuation in market value of insurance liabilities. The paper starts by explaining the concepts behind VAR models of Economic Capital used in banking. Differences between actuarial and financial views of risk are reviewed and explained. The paper concludes with proposing, developing and parameterizing a true VAR model of insurance loss reserve risk which combines several lines of business...|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews {{methods for}} hedging and {{valuation}} of insurance claims with an inherent financial risk, with {{special emphasis on}} quadratic hedging approaches and indifference pricing principles and their applications in insurance. It thus addresses aspects of the interplay between finance and insurance, an area which has gained considerable attention during the past years, in practice {{as well as in}} theory. Products <b>combining</b> <b>insurance</b> risk and financial risk have gained considerable market shares. Special attention is paid to unit-linked life insurance contracts, and it is demonstrated how these contracts can be valuated and hedged by using traditional methods as well as more recent methods from incomplete financial markets such as risk-minimization, meanvariance hedging, super-replication and indifference pricing with mean-variance utility functions...|$|R

40|$|Life insurance, in {{particular}} whole life insurance, {{plays an important}} role for private saving in Germany. Whole life <b>insurance</b> <b>combines</b> the <b>insurance</b> against uncertain death with a savings plan. Accordingly, a stylized model of life-cycle behavior would predict that whole life insurance purchases respond to both bequest motives and the tax advantages of life insurance compared with other forms of saving. Using data from the German Consumer Expenditure Survey (EVS), the paper shows that tax advantages and bequest motives indeed have an important impact on life insurance demand in Germany, if the empirical specification explicitly recognizes the censoring of life insurance face values. ...|$|R

40|$|An economy {{faces an}} unknown {{individual}} risk, {{such as the}} health effects of a recently discovered environmental hazard. Opinions may be widely different about the distribution of risks across the population. We study financial markets that suffice to reach efficient allocations in this situation. The problem is formalized in a general equilibrium economy with incomplete markets for individual and collective uncertainty. We show that ignorance of the probabilities describing individual risk leads to collective risk. Introducing an array of mutual insurance policies and of Arrow securities is shown to lead to Arrow-Debreu competitive allocations. By <b>combining</b> <b>insurance</b> contracts for individual risks and securities markets for collective risks, the proposed institutional framework economizes significantly on the number of markets required for efficiency. The computational complexity of a market equilibrium is reduced from an NP - complete (i. e. intractable) problem to one which depends polynomially on the number of households...|$|R
40|$|This paper empirically {{investigates the}} effect of policyholders’ private {{information}} about risky traffic behavior on automobile insurance coverage and ex post risk. It <b>combines</b> <b>insurance</b> company information with the policyholders’ private information on risky traffic behavior (traffic violations) that is not accessible to the insurance company. It is demonstrated that being unable to reject the null of zero correlation is not consistent with symmetric information in the automobile insurance market. A positive significant correlation for three out of ten groups of new policyholders is found, consistent with the adverse selection/moral hazard prediction. Besides, private information about risky traffic behavior increases ex post risk while it both increases and reduces the demand for extensive insurance. Our conclusion is that the ambiguity of previous findings in the automobile insurance market {{may be explained by}} that high risks have different demand for extensive insurance coverage.

Before the death time of parents, the object of family is to maximize weighted average of utility of parents and children. It is assumed that the utility function of both parents and children belong to HARA utility class.

We analyze how the change of weight and other parameters such as lower bound of consumption, income process, hazard rate affect the optimal policies using various numerical examples.
