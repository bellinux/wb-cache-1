5|$|Some of {{the causes}} of {{deliberate}} self-poisoning in Sri Lankan adolescents included bereavement and harsh discipline by parents. The <b>coping</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are being spread in local communities as people are surrounded by others who have previously deliberately harmed themselves or attempted suicide. One way of reducing self-harm would be to limit access to poisons; however many cases involve pesticides or yellow oleander seeds, and the reduction of access to these agents would be difficult. Great potential for the reduction of self-harm lies in education and prevention, but limited resources in the developing world make these methods challenging.|$|E
5|$|Treatments are varied {{because there}} are {{multiple}} perspectives of alcoholism. Those who approach alcoholism as a medical condition or disease recommend differing treatments from, for instance, those who approach the condition as one of social choice. Most treatments focus on helping people discontinue their alcohol intake, followed up with life training and/or social support to help them resist a return to alcohol use. Since alcoholism involves multiple factors which encourage a person to continue drinking, they must all be addressed to successfully prevent a relapse. An example {{of this kind of}} treatment is detoxification followed by a combination of supportive therapy, attendance at self-help groups, and ongoing development of <b>coping</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The treatment community for alcoholism typically supports an abstinence-based zero tolerance approach; however, some prefer a harm-reduction approach.|$|E

25|$|Crisis {{intervention}} is {{an immediate and}} short-term psychological care aimed at assisting individuals in a crisis situation to restore equilibrium to their biopsychosocial functioning and to minimize the potential for long-term psychological trauma.

25|$|Triggers and cues act as {{reminders}} of the trauma, and can cause anxiety and other associated emotions. Often the person can be completely unaware of what these triggers are. In many cases this may lead a person suffering from traumatic disorders to engage in disruptive or self-destructive <b>coping</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> often without being {{fully aware of the}} nature or causes of their own actions. Panic attacks are an example of a psychosomatic response to such emotional triggers.|$|E
25|$|Counselors serving ACOAs {{can also}} help by working on {{building}} <b>coping</b> <b>mechanisms</b> such as creating meaningful relationships with other non-alcoholic family members. Having other family members who are supportive can help the ACOA feel like they are not alone. Counselors can also provide some psycho-education on alcoholism {{and its effects on}} family members of alcoholics. Research shows that ACOAs feel less like blaming their parents for their alcoholism after learning that alcoholism is a disease, rather than a behavior.|$|E
25|$|The {{management}} of traumatic memories is important when treating mental health {{disorders such as}} post traumatic stress disorder. Traumatic memories can cause life problems even to individuals who {{do not meet the}} diagnostic criteria for a mental health disorder. They result from traumatic experiences, including natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis; violent events such as kidnapping, terrorist attacks, war, domestic abuse and rape. Traumatic memories are naturally stressful in nature and emotionally overwhelm people's existing <b>coping</b> <b>mechanisms.</b>|$|E

25|$|MacDonald (1963) {{observed}} {{in his most}} sadistic patients a triad of childhood cruelty to animals, firesetting and enuresis or frequent bed-wetting. Such maladaptive childhood behaviors often result from poorly developed <b>coping</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> This triad, although not intended to predict criminal behavior, provides the warning signs of a child under considerable stress. Children under substantial stress, particularly in their home environment, frequently engage in maladaptive behaviors, such as these, in order to alleviate the stress produced by their surroundings.|$|E
25|$|While not as profoundly {{disabling}} as {{the physical}} symptoms of these diseases, PBA can significantly influence individuals' social functioning and {{their relationships with}} others. Such sudden, frequent, extreme, uncontrollable emotional outbursts may lead to social withdrawal and interfere with activities of daily living, social and professional pursuits, and reduce overall healthcare. For example, patients with ALS and MS are often cognitively normal. However, the appearance of uncontrollable emotions is commonly associated with many additional neurological disorders such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Parkinson's disease, cerebral palsy, autism, epilepsy, and migraines. This may lead to severe embarrassment and avoidance of social interactions for the patient, which in turn impairs their <b>coping</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and their careers.|$|E
25|$|People with BPD {{are also}} {{especially}} sensitive {{to feelings of}} rejection, criticism, isolation, and perceived failure. Before learning other <b>coping</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> their efforts to manage or escape from their very negative emotions may lead to emotional isolation, self-injury or suicidal behavior. They are often aware of the intensity of their negative emotional reactions and, since they cannot regulate them, they shut them down entirely. This can be harmful to people with BPD, since negative emotions alert people {{to the presence of}} a problematic situation and move them to address it which the person with BPD would normally be aware of only to cause further distress. People with BPD may feel emotional relief after cutting themselves.|$|E

50|$|Stereotypies are {{sometimes}} {{considered to be}} a <b>coping</b> <b>mechanism</b> for animals experiencing stress. A physiological stress response can be induced by injecting an animal with ACTH and the animal's ability to cope with this stress can be monitored by measuring salivary cortisol. In a 2015 study, after ACTH injection, cribbers had higher cortisol levels than non-cribbers. Furthermore, cribbers which did not perform the stereotypy during the 3-hrs of testing had higher cortisol levels than non-cribters, whereas those performing the stereotypy did not. The researchers concluded that cribbing is a <b>coping</b> <b>mechanism</b> to stressful situations and that because of this, it should not be prevented.|$|R

25|$|While {{many factors}} can {{increase}} risk for ISP or RISP, {{they can be}} avoided with minor lifestyle changes. By maintaining a regular sleep schedule and observing good sleep hygiene, one can reduce chances of sleep paralysis. It helps subjects to reduce the intake of stimulants and stress in daily life by taking up a hobby or seeing a trained psychologist who can suggest <b>coping</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for stress. However, some cases of ISP and RISP involve a genetic factor—which means some people may find sleep paralysis unavoidable. Practicing meditation regularly might also be helpful in preventing fragmented sleep, and thus the occurrence of sleep paralysis. Research has shown that long-term meditation practitioners {{spend more time in}} slow wave sleep, and as such regular meditation practice could reduce nocturnal arousal and thus possibly sleep paralysis.|$|E
25|$|Intertidal organisms, {{especially}} those in the high intertidal, must cope with a large range of temperatures. While they are underwater, temperatures may only vary by a few degrees over the year. However, at low tide, temperatures may dip to below freezing or may become scaldingly hot, leading to a temperature range that may approach 30°C (86°F) during a period of a few hours. Many mobile organisms, such as snails and crabs, avoid temperature fluctuations by crawling around and searching for food at high tide and hiding in cool, moist refuges (crevices or burrows) at low tide. Besides simply living at lower tide heights, non-motile organisms may be more dependent on <b>coping</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> For example, high intertidal organisms have a stronger stress response, a physiological response of making proteins that help recovery from temperature stress just as the immune response aids in the recovery from infection.|$|E
25|$|The Kiribati Adaptation Program (KAP) is a US $5.5 million {{initiative}} that was originally {{enacted by the}} national government of Kiribati {{with the support of}} the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the World Bank, the United Nations Development Program, and the Japanese government. Australia later joined the coalition, donating US $1.5 million to the effort. The program aims to take place over six years, supporting measures that reduce Kiribati's vulnerability to the effects of climate change and sea level rise by raising awareness of climate change, assessing and protecting available water resources, and managing inundation. At the start of the Adaptation Program, representatives from each of the inhabited atolls identified key climatic changes that had taken place over the past 20–40 years and proposed <b>coping</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to deal with these changes under four categories of urgency of need. The program is now focusing on the country's most vulnerable sectors in the most highly populated areas. Initiatives include improving water supply management in and around Tarawa; coastal management protection measures such as mangrove re-plantation and protection of public infrastructure; strengthening laws to reduce coastal erosion; and population settlement planning to reduce personal risks.|$|E
50|$|Humor {{is found}} to be the most likely <b>coping</b> <b>mechanism</b> used by older {{officers}} to make light of the inmates' situations or their own. They use humor and nonchalance as a <b>coping</b> <b>mechanism</b> for dealing with the controversial things they hear and see while working in the correctional facilities. Many use this to prevent pondering too hardly on each situation they face on an everyday basis. Many of the female officers who use humor to cope are either continuing to work despite their misery or trying to deal with their situation differently. These officers {{were also more likely to}} be older and have been working in the correctional institution for a more substantial amount of time.|$|R

500|$|... "Heaven" [...] lyrically {{talks about}} the protagonist saying a final goodbye to a {{deceased}} beloved person. It contains emotional lyrics which offer comfort to the protagonist. The ballad opens with the line [...] "I fought for you the hardest, it made me the strongest, So tell me your secrets — I just can't stand to see you leaving" [...] sang with emotional and touching vocals by the singer. The hook [...] "Heaven couldn't wait for you / No heaven couldn't wait for you / So go on, go home" [...] is continuously repeated. BET'a Latifah Muhammad described Beyoncé's vocal rendition as [...] "heartbreaking yet optimistic". [...] "Heaven" [...] closes with a spoken 20-second snippet outro of the Lord's Prayer (...) recited in Spanish by Melissa Vargas, the singer's brand manager. Many critics noted how the song may {{have been inspired by}} the singer's miscarriage. Clare Lobenfeld from Complex magazine concluded that the song featured Beyoncé's <b>coping</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for the loss of her child, which included using humor to hide pain. According to Spin writer Anupa Mistry, it is in line with one of the themes touched on in the parent album, motherhood. On the album, [...] "Heaven" [...] is placed before [...] "Blue", as the penultimate track. It was noted by critics that both songs were antidotes to each other– while the former discusses notions of death, the latter celebrates birth. Joey Guerra from the Houston Chronicle found the inclusion of those songs as the last on Beyoncé {{as a metaphor for the}} entire album [...] "Darkness always gives way to light, and heartbreak, if you hold on, is always followed by hope".|$|E

By June 2009, she had 590,000 Twitter followers, 94,000 subscribers to the iJustine YouTube channel and 25,000 Facebook fans. The USA Today story goes on to describe how she has scaled down her lifecasting because of its deleterious impact on her life. Carl's Jr. has hired a team of YouTube stars, including Ezarik to produce made-for-web ads for their new Portobello Mushroom Six-Dollar Burger on the Carl's Jr. YouTube channel, each endorser's YouTube page, and other Google-related media outlets. Following the August 6, 2009, Twitter Denial-of-service attack, Ezarik was featured in The Wall Street Journal describing her <b>coping</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> such as repeatedly tapping the F5 function key (the refresh button), for Twitter outages. In December 2009, USA Today reported that Ezarik earns about $75,000 annually from YouTube, and claims she has nearly a million followers on Twitter and 300,000 YouTube subscribers.

500|$|Claudia Black and Michael Shanks (Daniel Jackson) linked their characters' early {{relationship}} to a Spencer Tracy/Katharine Hepburn dynamic of [...] "not {{so much of}} tension, but rather constant antagonism". Despite the concern in early season 9 that their relationship would stagnate and dumb down their characters, Shanks felt Vala brought out a side of Daniel {{that he had not}} had the chance to play before, and Black advocated the slow revelation of Vala's layers of denial. The writers continued to develop the friendship between Vala and Daniel throughout season 10, aiming not to lose their sexual chemistry. Michael Shanks stated that by [...] "Memento Mori", [...] "Daniel legitimately cares about Vala and has seen some sort of redemption in her and wants that process to continue." [...] From Black's point of view, Daniel offers [...] "an interesting window" [...] into [...] "Vala's external façade to be playful with people". He helps Vala grow as a person and forces her to [...] "develop <b>coping</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that allow her to be more adult and learn that it's OK to be honest and talk how you feel." [...] Asked about a possible romance between Vala and Daniel before the filming of the series finale, Black predicted that a consummation of the relationship would end badly in terms of both story and on-screen chemistry. When producer Robert C. Cooper presented his preliminary script for the series finale, [...] "Unending", both Black and Shanks protested his intended story of having Vala and Daniel sleep together without a confrontation. Shanks felt that [...] "here's always been this underlining, keeping [...] at arms length because of the fear of getting too close." [...] After Cooper rewrote the scene to increase Vala's vulnerability to Daniel, and have Daniel truthfully explain his feelings of a relationship, the actors decided to play the confrontation scene as genuinely as possible, with both characters being neither completely in-character nor totally out-of-character.|$|E
