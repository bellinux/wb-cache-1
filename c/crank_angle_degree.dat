40|$|Abstract—To {{calculate}} soot {{source terms}} a new detailed kinetic soot model {{is applied to}} study the formation and oxidation of soot particles in turbulent flames. The model {{is based on a}} detailed description of the chemical and physical processes leading to the formation of soot. It can be subdivided into the growth of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the gas phase reactions and the processes of particle inception, condensation, surface growth, and oxidation. Two different parts are developed about the growth of PAHs in the gas phase reaction. The first step towards the formation of soot is the formation of benzene and the second step is how to form PAH from benzene. In surface growth and oxidation process Hydrogen Abstraction- Carbon Addition (HACA) mechanism is modified due to the finding that the bound between the acetylene and the soot surface can be broken at high temperature in the experiment. Finally the analysis about soot source terms are used in turbulent combustion and different calculated results are obtained for different soot source terms.

The camera A/D conversion was 8 bit, and the spectral range extended from 390 to 900 [*]nm. The camera was equipped with a 50 -mm focal Nikon lens (Nikon UK Ltd., Surrey, England); a camera region of interest was selected (480 [*]×[*] 480 pixel) to obtain the best match between spatial and temporal resolution.

30|$|In Fig.  9, {{the gross}} heat release {{calculation}} results are presented. Nevertheless, in the CFD model the flame is quenched at near 370 <b>crank</b> <b>angle</b> <b>degrees</b> (Fig.  6), then {{a small amount}} of heat is gradually released from 370 to 440 <b>crank</b> <b>angle</b> <b>degrees.</b> In fact, the gross heat release is actually the heat release due to a combination of all the chemical reactions (combustion, dissociation, re-association). Therefore, the different trend between the models in Fig.  9 is ascribable to chemical reactions which initially absorb a part of the heat generated by the combustion (dissociation) and then gradually release heat during the expansion phase (re-association) [17]. However, the final value of the cumulative gross heat release is very compatible for both the operating conditions. Thus, the SZ model lacks the capability of predicting the real combustion dynamics but demonstrates accuracy in the evaluation of the cumulative heat, released during the combustion. No strong differences are evident between the two analyzed operating conditions.|$|R

40|$|In a {{previous}} study, {{in order to}} investigate the effect of charge stratification on combustion behavior such as combustion efficiency and combustion phasing which also largely affects the emissions, an experiment was conducted in a heavy-duty compression ignition (CI) metal engine. The engine behavior and emission characteristics were studied in the transition from HCCI mode to PPC mode by varying the start of injection (SOI) timing. To gain more detailed information of the mixing process, in-cylinder laser diagnostic measurements, namely fuel-tracer planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) imaging, were conducted in an optical version of the heavy-duty CI engine mentioned above. To the authors’ best knowledge, {{this is the first}} time to perform fuel-tracer PLIF measurements in an optical engine with a close to production bowl in piston combustion chamber, under transition conditions from HCCI to PPC mode. Results show that four mixing schemes can be distinguished as the SOI timings are varied during the transition. They are linked to the results presented in the reference paper, where emissions were varied in different zones. For SOI at - 100 <b>crank</b> <b>angle</b> <b>degree</b> (CAD), fuel distribution is homogeneous as expected. With other SOI timings, a significant part of the fuel mixture was trapped in the squish region and crevice area before start of combustion (SOC) as shown by PLIF results.

The fuel is injected to the intake port manifolds to generate uniform fuel/air mixture in the cylinder. Two different piston shapes, one with a flat disc and one with a square bowl, were employed to generate different in-cylinder turbulence and temperature field prior to autoignition. The {{aim of this study}} was to scrutinize the effect of in-cylinder turbulence on the temperature field and on the combustion process. The fuel tracer, acetone, is measured using laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) to characterize the reaction fronts, and chemiluminescence images were recorded using a high-speed camera, with a 0. 25 <b>crank</b> <b>angle</b> <b>degree</b> resolution, to further illustrate the combustion process. Pressure in the cylinder is recorded in the experiments. Spatial and temporal resolved LES was used to gain information on the turbulence mixing, heat transfer and combustion process. It was shown that gas temperature in the piston bowl is generally higher than that in the squish, leading to an earlier ignition in the bowl. Compared to the disc engine, the square bowl engine has a higher temperature inhomogeneity owing to the turbulence wall heat transfer. The experimentally observed higher combustion duration and slower pressure rise rate in the square bowl engine as compared to the disc engine can be explained by the higher temperature inhomogeneity in the square bowl engine...|$|E

40|$|Low {{temperature}} combustion (LTC) is {{an appealing}} new method of combustion that promises low nitric oxides and soot emissions while maintaining or improving on engine performance. The three main points {{of this study}} were to develop and validate an engine model in GT-Power capable of implementing LTC, to study parametrically exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and injection timing effects on performance and emissions, and to investigate methods to decrease pressure rise rates during LTC operation. The model was validated at nine different operating points, 3 speeds and 3 loads, while the parametric studies were conducted on 6 of the 9 operating points, 3 speeds and 2 loads. The model consists of sections that include: cylinders, ports, intake and exhaust manifolds, EGR system, and turbocharger. For this model, GT-Power calculates the combustion using a multi-zone, quasi-dimensional model and a knock-induced combustion model. The main difference between them is that the multi-zone model is directly injected while the knock model is port injected. A variety of sub models calculate the fluid flow and heat transfer. A parametric study varying the EGR and the injection timing to determine the optimal combination was conducted using the multi-zone model while a parametric study that just varies EGR is carried out using the knock model. The first parametric study showed that the optimal EGR and injection timing combination for the low loads occurred at high levels of EGR (60 percent) and advanced injection timings (30 to 40 <b>crank</b> <b>angle</b> <b>degrees</b> before top dead center). The optimal EGR and injection timing combination for the high loads occurred at low levels of EGR (30 percent to 40 percent) and retarded injection timings (7. 5 to 5 <b>crank</b> <b>angle</b> <b>degrees</b> before top dead center). The knock model determined that the ideal EGR ratio for homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) operation varied from 30 percent to 45 percent, depending on the operating condition. Three methods were investigated as possible ways to reduce pressure rise rates during LTC operation. The only feasible method was the multiple injection strategy which provided dramatically reduced pressure rise rates across all EGR levels and injection timings...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} {{different}} {{internal and external}} EGR strategies, combined with extreme Miller cycles, were analyzed {{by means of a}} one dimensional CFD simulation code for a Wartsila 6 cylinder, 4 strokes, medium speed marine diesel engine, to evaluate their potential in order to reach the IMO Tier 3 NOx emissions target. By means of extreme Miller cycles, with Early Intake Valve Closures (EIVC up to 100 <b>crank</b> <b>angle</b> <b>degrees</b> before BDC), a shorter compression stroke and lower charge temperatures inside the cylinder can be achieved and thanks to the cooler combustion process, the NOx specific emissions can be effectively reduced. EIVC strategies can also be combined with reductions of the scavenging period (valve overlap) {{to increase the amount of}} exhaust gases in the combustion chamber. However, the remarkably high boost pressure levels needed for such extreme Miller cycles, require mandatorily the use of two stage turbocharging systems. Despite two stages turbocharging, combined with extreme Miller timings, may allow up to 50 % NOx reduction compared to a conventional, single stage turbocharger architecture, further NOx emissions reductions are necessary to meet the IMO Tier 3 NOx limit. Higher EGR percentages, which could be achieved by means of external circuits, were therefore also evaluated. However, it should be pointed out that, although the external EGR technology is well established for automotive and heavy duty diesel engines, it is not yet state of the art for marine diesel engines, and its application to a highly boosted engine using extreme Miller timings is not straightforward. Several different complex EGR routes were thus investigated, and for the preliminary assessment of their NOx emissions abatement potentialities, the use of numerical simulation allowed a detailed and extensive evaluation of the effects on engine performance, fuel consumption, NOx emissions and thermal and mechanical loads on engine components of the combination of different intake valve profiles, intake valve closure timings and scavenging periods with different external exhaust gas recirculation solutions.

40|$|In {{this study}} the main {{objective}} was to estimate the instantaneous turbine shaft power and turbine efficiency of a turbocharger mounted on a 6 -cylinder 13 literheavy-duty diesel engine. The work was carried out at Scania CV AB in Södertälje, Sweden from January to June 2015 as master thesis under the division of Internal Combustion Engines at the Royal Institute of Technology KTH, Stockholm, Sweden. Normally the turbine performance is estimated during off-engine conditions in a gas flow bench during steady flow. When the turbocharger is mounted on the engine, the flow {{is far from being}} steady. The exhaust gas flow is pulsating and every thermodynamic property with it as well. In this thesis theturbine performance is estimated 1 <b>crank</b> <b>angle</b> <b>degree</b> resolved with 1 <b>crank</b> <b>angle</b> <b>degree</b> resolved pressures and turbocharger speed. Parameters difficult to measure crank angle resolved such as temperature and exhaust mass flow rate are estimated utilizing methods found in literature. The turbine efficiency is defined as the utilized turbine shaft power divided with the isentropic turbine power. The utilized shaft power consists of the power consumed by the compressor, which is assumed to be constant in this thesis, the power lost due to bearing friction and the acceleration power of the rotating parts. The result of the used method revealed a fluctuating turbine efficiency, very seldom at the same levels as the optimal efficiency obtained during steady flow during one engine cycle. The results where promising, but lacked the needed accuracy to estimate the instantaneous turbine performance with proven confidence. Primarily this is believed to be caused by the instantaneous exhaust mass flow rate approximation based on a calculated dynamical pressure. Another factor impacting the overall accuracy is the assumed constant compressor power. Further development of the method is needed and could yield results with better confidence in the future. Denna rapport handlar om skattning av momentan turbinaxeleffekt och turbinverkningsgrad för ett turboaggregat monterat på en 6 -cylindrig 13 liter stordieselmotor. Arbetet gjordes på och för Scania CV AB i Södertälje, från Januari till Juni 2015, som ett examensarbete under institutionen Förbränningsmotorteknik på Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan, Stockholm. När turbinprestandan normalt bestämms, sker detta i en s. k. flödesbänk där turbinen matas med ett konstant flöde. När turbon är monterad på en motor ser flädessituationen annorlunda ut, avgasflödet och dess termodynamiska tillståndpulserar. I den här rapporten skattas turbinprestandan vevvinkelupplöst med hjälp av vevvinkelupplösta tryck och turbovarvtal. Parametrar nästintill omöjliga att mäta vevinkeluppöst såsom temperatur och avgasmassflöde har skattats vevvinkelupplöst med metoder funna i litteratur. Turbinverkningsgraden består av den utnyttjade axeleffekten dividerad medden isentropa turbineffekten, där den utnyttjade axeleffekten består av kompressoreffekten vilken betraktats som konstant, en lagerfriktionsförlust samt enaccelerationseffekt av de roterande delarna i turbon. Resultatet visade att turbineeffekten och turbinverkningsgraden fluktuerade, som väntat med fluktuerande ingångsparmetrar och att verkningsgraden sällan är den optimala framtagen under konstant flöde. Den använda metodiken visade sig ge ett lovande resultat, men saknade tillräcklig noggranhet för att bestämma turbinverkningsgraden med stort förtroende över en hel motorcykel. Detta tros primärt vara en följd av det uppskattade momentana avgasmassflödet baserat på ett dynamiskt tryck och sekundärt en antaganen konstant kompressoreffekt.

40|$|Partially Premixed Combustion (PPC) is a {{promising}} combustion concept,based on judicious tuning {{of the charge}} stratification, to meet the increasing demands of emission legislation and to improve fuel efficiency. Longer ignition delays of PPC in comparison with conventional diesel combustion provide better fuel/air mixture which decreases soot and NO emissions. Moreover, a proper injection timing and strategy for PPC can improve the combustion stability {{as a result of}} a higher level of fuel stratification in comparison with the Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) concept. Injection timing is the major parameter with which to affect the level of fuel and combustion stratification and to control the combustion phasing and the heat release behavior. The scope of the present study is to investigate the fluid flow characteristics of PPC at different injection timings.

HCCI engines typically operate at lean equivalence ratios (ϕ) at which the ion current becomes increasingly indistinguishable from background noise. This paper investigates the effect of fuel additives on the ion signal at low equivalence ratios, determines side effects of metal acetate addition, and validates numerical model for ionization chemistry. Cesium acetate (CsOAc) and potassium acetate (KOAc) were used as additives to ethanol as the primary fuel. Concentration levels of 100, 200, and 400 mg/L of metal acetate-in-ethanol are investigated at equivalence ratios of 0. 08, 0. 20, and 0. 30.

CsOAc consistently produced the strongest ion signals at all conditions when compared to KOAc. The ion signal was found to decrease with increased intake pressure; an increase in the additive concentration increased the ion signal for all cases. However, the addition of the metal acetates decreased the gross indicated mean effective pressure (IMEPg), maximum rate of heat release (ROHR), and peak cylinder pressure.

IVC (inlet valve closing) timings were set at up to 60  CA (<b>crank</b> <b>angle)</b> <b>degrees</b> earlier than the production setting of 37 ° ABDC for the engine. At the earliest timing, effective compression ratio was reduced from 15. 2 : 1 to 13. 7 : 1. The effects on emissions were significant only for EIVC settings at least 40  CA degrees earlier than the production setting, and were sensitive to engine load. At 2  bar BMEP (brake mean effective pressure) and fixed levels of NOx, soot emissions were reduced but CO (carbon monoxide) and HC (hydrocarbon) increased unless fuel rail pressure was reduced. With increasing load, soot reduction diminished and was negligible at 6  bar BMEP; CO and HC emissions deteriorated further. At all conditions, EIVC raised exhaust gas temperature by > 50  °C; the effect on fuel economy was negligible or a fuel economy penalty. Comparisons indicate cylinder deactivation is the more effective strategy for reducing engine-out emissions of HC and CO and raising exhaust gas temperature under light load operating conditions...|$|R

In this way, {{the significance of}} the 2 -stroke HCCI engine has been underestimated as it can provide more power stroke in comparison to a 4 -stroke engine. Moreover, the mass of trapped residual gases is much larger in a 2 -stroke engine, causing higher initial charge temperatures, which leads to easier auto-ignition. For controlling 2 -stroke HCCI engines, it is vital to find optimized simulation approaches of HCCI combustion with a focus on ignition timing. In this study, a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) model for a 2 -stroke gasoline engine was developed coupled to a semi-detailed chemical mechanism of iso-octane to investigate the simulation capability of the considered chemical mechanism and the effects of different simulation parameters such as the turbulence model, grid density and time step size. The validation of numerical results was carried using an experimental study on the 2 -stroke engine that was modified to operate in HCCI mode. Results confirm that the considered iso-octane chemical mechanism is able to predict the ignition timing of HCCI combustion in the 2 -stroke gasoline engine but special care has to be taken to the numerical setting like grid size, time step size and turbulence model.

The effect of octane number on combustion, emissions and engine performance in a 6 cylinder SCANIA truck engine, fuelled with n-heptane and isooctane, and running in HCCI mode, are investigated numerically and compared with measurements taken from Olsson et al. [SAE 2000 - 01 - 2867]. To correctly simulate the HCCI engine operation, we implement a probability density function (PDF) based stochastic reactor model (including detailed chemical kinetics and accounting for inhomogeneities in composition and temperature) coupled with GT-POWER, a 1 -D fluid dynamics based engine cycle simulator. Such a coupling proves to be ideal for the understanding of the combustion phenomenon as well as the gas dynamics processes intrinsic to the engine cycle. The convective heat transfer in the engine cylinder is modeled as a stochastic jump process and accounts for the fluctuations and fluid-wall interaction effects. Curl's coalescence-dispersion model is used to describe turbulent mixing. A good agreement is observed between the predicted values and measurements for in-cylinder pressure, auto-ignition timing and CO, HC as well as NOx emissions for the base case. The advanced PDF-based engine cycle simulator clearly outperforms the widely used homogeneous model based full cycle engine simulator. The trends in combustion characteristics such as ignition <b>crank</b> <b>angle</b> <b>degree</b> and combustion duration with respect to varying octane numbers are predicted well as compared to measurements.

Such a sensor has a substantial cost and its use is not really fast; a different approach can be followed using a thermodynamic method, whose input is the pressure curve sampled during the compression and expansion strokes of a “motored” (i. e. without combustion) cylinder. In this work the authors compare an original thermodynamic method with other ones available in literature, by means of both experimental and simulated pressure curves. A zero dimensional thermodynamic model was employed to obtain an extensive collection of numeric pressure curves by changing engine geometry (e. g. compression ratios from 10 to 20 were adopted), operative conditions and wall heat transfer laws. The in-cylinder mass leakage has been taken into account in the model.

Additionally, the effect of an inefficient turbocharger on an engine operating at part-load was also investigated. It was observed that an overly lean air/fuel mixture caused inefficient scavenging and the corresponding level of residual gas trapped in the cylinder increased. This resulted in partial combustion which could be observed as white smoke from the engine exhaust stack, therefore indicating the presence of unburnt fuel. Exhaust valve timing measurements showed that the cylinder with the highest wear rate had its valve closure timing 10 <b>crank</b> <b>angle</b> <b>degrees</b> after the cylinder with least wear rate. The exhaust valves were closed earlier than the designed condition which impaired the scavenging process and increased the level of residual gas trapped in the cylinder. This resulted in a reduction of the actual air-to-fuel ratio and high exhaust gas temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Simultaneous laser-induced {{fluorescence}} (LIF) imaging of formaldehyde and a fuel-tracer {{have been}} performed in a direct-injection HCCI engine. A mix of N-heptane and iso-octane was used as fuel and Toluene as fluorescent tracer. The experimental setup involves two pulsed Nd:YAG lasers and two ICCD cameras. Frequency-quadrupled laser radiation at 266 nm {{from one of the}} Nd:YAG lasers was used for excitation of the fuel tracer. The resulting fluorescence was detected with one of the ICCD cameras in the spectral region 270 - 320 nm. The second laser system provided frequency-tripled radiation at 355 nm for excitation of formaldehyde. Detection in the range 395 - 500 nm was achieved with the second ICCD. The aim of the presented work is to investigate the applicability of utilizing formaldehyde as a naturally occurring fuel marker. Formaldehyde is formed in the low-temperature reactions (LTR) prior to the main combustion and should thus be present were fuel is located until it is consumed. Measurements were performed when injecting fuel early and late in the compression stroke. Early injection timing results in a homogeneous charge at the time of auto-ignition, while late timing gives a more stratified charge. The <b>crank</b> <b>angle</b> position at which measurements were performed was altered to cover the entire combustion cycle. The measurement images show instantaneous distributions of toluene and formaldehyde respectively. Images from both early and late injection and at all <b>crank</b> <b>angle</b> <b>degrees</b> show good spatial resemblance between toluene signal area and formaldehyde signal area. The work presented in this paper shows that formaldehyde is a feasible alternative to traditional fuel tracers for visualizing fuels featuring low-temperature reactions in HCCI combustio...|$|R
40|$|Global {{concerns}} over atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) levels {{and the security}} of fossil fuel supply {{have led to the}} development of biofuels; a potentially carbon-neutral and renewable fuel strategy. One new gasoline-alternative biofuel candidate is 2, 5 -dimethylfuran (DMF). In this paper, the potential of DMF is examined in a direct-injection spark-ignition (DISI) engine. Focus is given to the combustion performance and emissions sensitivity around the optimum spark timing, especially at 10 <b>crank</b> <b>angle</b> <b>degrees</b> retard (SR 10). Such spark retard strategies are commonly used to reduce catalyst light-off times, albeit at the cost of reduced engine performance and increased CO 2. The results for DMF are compared to gasoline, ethanol, butanol and methanol so that its sensitivity can be positioned relatively. The overall order of spark sensitivity at the highest load (8. 5 bar IMEP) was: gasoline > butanol > DMF > ethanol > methanol. The four biofuels widen the spark window due to improved anti-knock qualities and sometimes increased charge-cooling. This allows the increase of CO 2 to be better minimized than with gasoline. Furthermore, DMF is the only biofuel to produce high exhaust gas temperatures, similar to gasoline and helpful for fast catalyst light-off, whilst maintaining high combustion stabilities. This demonstrates the potentially favorable characteristics of DMF to become an effective cold-start fuel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|In the {{automotive}} industry, the piezo-based in-cylinder pressure sensor is getting commercialized {{and used in}} production vehicles. For example, the pressure sensor offers the opportunity to design algorithms for estimation of engine emissions, such as soot and NO, during a combustion cycle. In this paper a zero-dimensional NO model for a diesel engine is implemented {{that will be used}} in real time. The model is based on the thermal NO formation and the Zeldovich mechanism using two non-geometrical zones: burned and unburned zone. The influence of EGR on combustion temperature was modeled using a well-known thermodynamic identity where specific heat at constant pressure is included. Specific heat will vary with temperature and the gas composition. The model was implemented in LabVIEW using tools specific for an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array). In order to simplify and implement the model, least-squares-criterion-based polynomial approximations are used that enables the utilization of fast algorithms as well as sub-routines (sub-VIs). The sub-routines can be used to save space on the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and thus minimizing the risk of potential issues regarding overmapping of the hardware. In this case the interpolating functions are polynomials that only consume addition and multiplication operations. This is suited for the objective in mind {{due to the fact that}} the model tailored for an FPGA cannot, in a sufficient manner, handle highly complex calculations nor divisions. The time results obtained during the execution of the model indicates that it is possible to update the NO, at a given temporal state, well below the time corresponding to a <b>crank</b> <b>angle</b> <b>degree.</b> The FPGA NO model was tested against measurement data collected from a Scania engine. The time needed to execute an iteration of the model was approximately 3 μs...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} an {{experimental}} investigation of rare misfire and partial burn cycles in a spray-guided spark-ignited direct-injection optical engine. Spark discharge energy, discharge duration, flame imaging, velocity and equivalence ratio were measured every <b>crank</b> <b>angle</b> <b>degree.</b> Imaging was performed using high-speed 2 -D particle image velocimetry (PIV) and planar laser inducted fluorescence (PLIF). The engine was operated near its optimum but produced rare and random partial burn and misfire cycles. Spark energy and spark duration for the partial burn and misfire cycles fell {{within the range}} of those for the well-burned cycles, with a slight bias toward low-energy, short-duration discharges, indicating no abnormal spark discharge events. PIV and PLIF measurements extracted from a 4 mm _ 4 mm region adjacent to and downstream of the spark plug at spark timing revealed that the partial burn and misfire cycles occur under lean mixtures and low velocities, but still {{within the range of}} values for the well-burned cycles. PIV and PLIF images of partial burn and misfire cycles were compared to well-burned cycles, which had similar velocities and equivalence ratios near the spark plug at the onset of spark. Observations of the fuel distribution and flame areas for the partial burns and misfires showed that an early flame kernel was always formed, but failed to develop sufficiently to propagate to the fuel in the bowl. A flame kernel arriving late within the piston bowl found significantly leaner conditions and the mixture was not fully consumed leading to a partial burn. For misfire cycles, the mixture in the measurement plane was significantly leaner surrounding the flame kernel, which disappeared shortly after the spark discharge. It is concluded that the partial burns and misfires are not the result of failed ignition, but failure during the flame propagation process...|$|E
40|$|Natural gas is a {{promising}} alternative fuel for {{internal combustion engine}} application due to its low carbon content and high knock resistance. Performance of natural gas engines is further improved if direct injection, high turbocharger boost level, and variable valve actuation (VVA) are adopted. Also, relevant efficiency benefits can be obtained through downsizing. However, mixture quality resulting from direct gas injection {{has proven to be}} problematic. This work aims at developing a mono-fuel small-displacement turbocharged compressed natural gas engine with side-mounted direct injector and advanced VVA system. An injector configuration was designed in order to enhance the overall engine tumble and thus overcome low penetration. Gas injection, interaction thereof with charge motion and geometrical bounding walls, and the resultant mixture formation process was investigated in detail by the combination of planar laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) in an optical engine and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis with moving injector model to verify the design of the injector and combustion chamber. Then a prototype engine was tested to compare the rated torque against target performance. The planar LIF investigation underlined the influence of the Coandǎ effect whereby the gas jet was deflected to the adjacent injector niche and then to the combustion chamber roof. Such effect was inhibited at early injection timings due to strong intake air flow. CFD analysis confirmed this behavior and pointed out that the mixing process is dominated by the gas jet during injection and flow patterns promoted by it. It was concluded that the principal mixing mechanism is the jet-promoted tumble and elliptical swirl motion, and the mixing rate is thereby scaled with absolute time, rather than <b>crank</b> <b>angle</b> <b>degree,</b> and mainly determined by the strength of these two motion patterns. It was in addition found that the injection contributes to combustion-relevant turbulence mainly by intensifying the large-scale charge motion. Overall high mixing capacity was observed, and the injector and combustion chamber design deemed efficacious. The engine design has been successfully accomplished and the prototype multi-cylinder engine (MCE) is ready for extensive performance and emission analysis on the test rig...|$|E
40|$|Premixed charge {{compression}} ignition (PCCI) {{is widely considered}} to be a possible method of meeting increasingly strict emissions regulations in internal combustion engines. PCCI can reduce harmful emissions substantially {{and at the same time}} increase efficiency relative to conventional combustion modes. Because of the nature of PCCI, changes in in-cylinder conditions have a greater impact than in conventional diesel engines. Therefore cylinder to cylinder variations are amplified which leads to problems such as misfire and decreased efficiency in cylinders with increased ignition delay and lower apparent heat release rate (AHRR) amplitudes. Two possible methods to counteract this effect in diesel engines were studied. First a GT-POWER simulation showed that by altering the start of injection (SOI) for each cylinder individually it is possible to move the start of combustion (SOC) for individual cylinders back. Second a method of advancing SOC and increasing AHRR amplitudes by using early exhaust valve closing (EVC) to trap hot exhaust gases in cylinders was simulated in GT-POWER and analyzed. GT-POWER simulations showed that moving SOI forward successfully resulted in earlier SOCs. Through analysis of the same simulation data it was determined that SOI should be advance by 0 to 3. 44 <b>crank</b> <b>angle</b> <b>degrees</b> (CAD) from the nominal SOI timing. The simulations indicated that the EVC altering method would not have the desired effect on SOC and this result was analyzed. This work provides a method of decreasing cylinder to cylinder variations thus increasing the stability and efficiency of PCCI combustion...|$|R
40|$|Homogeneous-Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engines {{have been}} shown to have higher thermal eciencies and lower NOx and soot {{emissions}} than Spark Ignition engines. However, HCCI engines experience very large heat release rates which can lead to the occurrence of damaging engine knock. One method of reducing the maximum heat release rate is to introduce thermal inhomogeneities, thereby spreading the heat release over several <b>crank</b> <b>angle</b> <b>degrees.</b> Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) with complex H 2 /Air chemistry by Hawkes et al. (2005) showed that both ignition fronts and de agration-like fronts are present in systems with such inhomogeneities. Here, an enthalpy-based amelet model is presented and applied to the four cases of varying initial temperature variance presented in Hawkes et al. (2005). This model uses a mean scalar dissipation rate to model the mixing between regions of higher and lower enthalpies. The predicted heat release rates agree well with the heat release rates of the four DNS cases. Although this model does not treat ignition fronts and de agration-like fronts dierently, here it is shown to be capable of capturing the combustion characteristics for both the case in which combustion occurs primarily in the form of spontaneous ignition fronts and for the case dominated by de agration-type burning. The amelet-based model shows considerably improved agreement with the DNS results over the popular multi-zone model, particularly, where both de agrative and spontaneous ignition are occurring, that is, where diusion is important...|$|R
40|$|Formaldehyde (CH 2 O) is a {{characteristic}} species for the ignition phase of diesel-like fuels. As such, the spatio-temporal distribution of formaldehyde is an informative parameter {{in the study}} of the ignition event in internal combustion engines, especially for new combustion modes like homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI). This paper presents quantitative data on the CH 2 O distribution around diesel and n-heptane fuel sprays in the combustion chamber of a commercial heavy-duty diesel engine. Excitation of the band (355 nm) as well as the band (339 nm) is applied. We use quantitative, spectrally resolved laser-induced fluorescence, calibrated by means of formalin seeding, to distinguish the contribution from CH 2 O to the signal from those of other species formed early in the combustion. Typically, between 40 % and 100 % of the fluorescence in the wavelength range considered characteristic for formaldehyde is in fact due to other species, but the latter are also related to the early combustion. Numerical simulation of a homogeneous reactor of n-heptane and air yields concentrations that are in reasonable agreement with the measurements. Formaldehyde starts to be formed at about 2 °CA (<b>crank</b> <b>angle</b> <b>degrees)</b> before the rise in main heat release. There appears to be a rather localised CH 2 O formation zone relatively close to the injector, out of which formaldehyde is transported downstream by the fuel jet. Once the hot combustion sets in, formaldehyde quickly disappears...|$|R
