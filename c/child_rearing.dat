5|$|Summerhill: A Radical Approach to <b>Child</b> <b>Rearing</b> is a {{book about}} the English {{boarding}} school Summerhill School by its headmaster A. S. Neill. It is known for introducing his ideas to the American public. It was published in America on November 7, 1960, by the Hart Publishing Company and later revised as Summerhill School: A New View of Childhood in 1993. Its contents are a repackaged collection from four of Neill's previous works. The foreword was written by psychoanalyst Erich Fromm, who distinguished between authoritarian coercion and Summerhill.|$|E

Bayard, a Union College classmate of Eleazar Cady's and son of James A. Bayard, Sr., a U.S. Senator from Wilmington, Delaware was, {{at the time of his}} engagement and marriage to Tryphena, an apprentice in Daniel Cady's law office. He was instrumental in nurturing Stanton's growing understanding of the explicit and implicit gender hierarchies within the legal system.|$|E

Reproductive health includes {{a wide range of issues}} including the health and function of structures and systems involved in reproduction, pregnancy, childbirth and <b>child</b> <b>rearing,</b> including antenatal and perinatal care. Global women's health has a much larger focus on reproductive health than that of developed countries alone, but also infectious diseases such as malaria in pregnancy and non-communicable diseases (NCD). Many of the issues that face women and girls in resource poor regions are relatively unknown in developed countries, such as female genital cutting, and further lack access to the appropriate diagnostic and clinical resources.|$|E

5|$|Summerhill: A Radical Approach to <b>Child</b> <b>Rearing</b> {{was written}} by A. S. Neill and {{published}} by Hart Publishing Company in 1960. In a letter to Neill, New York publisher Harold Hart suggested a book specific for America devised of parts from four of Neill's previous works: The Problem Child, The Problem Parent, The Free Child, and That Dreadful School. Neill liked his idea and gave the publisher wide liberties in the manuscript's preparation, preferring to write a preface or appendix in reflection on the writings. In rereading his work, he realized he disagreed with his earlier statements on Freudian child analysis. Neill later regretted the liberties he afforded the publisher, particularly his removal of Wilheim Reich's name from the book and index, since Neill saw Reich as an influential figure. They also struggled over issues of copyrights. Neill did not contest his disagreements, as {{he was eager to}} see the book published.|$|E

40|$|Although {{institutional}} care jeopardizes children’s development, {{some studies suggest}} that well-functioning child-care institutions may offer children a better environment than their own dysfunctional families. For {{the growing number of}} HIV-infected children who often live in underprivileged families or institutions, comparative studies on their care arrangements are crucial. In her dissertation Natasha Dobrova-Krol examined the impact of {{institutional care}} and HIV-infection on several developmental domains of more than 60 Ukrainian preschoolers. Physical growth, stress regulation, cognitive and social development, as well as organization of attachment and children’s indiscriminately friendly behavior were addressed in this study. Developmental outcomes of HIV-infected <b>children</b> <b>reared</b> in disadvantaged families were compared with the outcomes of <b>children</b> <b>reared</b> in institutions providing adequate medical and physical care. In search for possible risk and protective factors {{in the development of the}} children individual characteristics and various aspects of the rearing environment were explored. The findings of this study demonstrated that institutional rearing impeded the development of children in all domains. Both for children with and without HIV family care, even of compromised quality, was better than institutional care, even of good quality. HIV-infection was found to be associated with less favorable outcomes in physical growth and cognitive development. The negative impact of institutional care, however, was larger than the presence of HIV. In three out of six developmental domains that were examined, HIV-infected <b>children</b> <b>reared</b> in disadvantaged families showed significantly better results than both HIV-infected and uninfected <b>children</b> <b>reared</b> in institutions, and no difference was found in the other domains. The quality of the child-caregiver relationship had a larger impact on children’s physical growth and cognitive performance than either HIV-infection or the quality of the physical environment and thus represents an important intervention target. The study has important implications for intervention efforts in child-care institutions. Promotores: M. H. van IJzendoorn, M. J. Bakermans-Kranenburg, F.

40|$|This paper {{makes two}} contributions. First, {{it adds to}} the growing {{literature}} describing correlations between children's educational outcomes and family structure. Although popular discussions focus on the distinction between two-parent families and single-parent families, McLanahan and Sandefur [1994] show that outcomes for stepchildren are similar to outcomes for children in single-parent families. McLanahan and Sandefur describe their results as showing that the crucial distinction is between <b>children</b> who were <b>reared</b> by both biological parents and children who were not. This description is misleading. This paper shows that educational outcomes for both types of children in blended families [...] stepchildren and their half-siblings who are the joint biological children of both parents [...] are similar {{to each other and}} substantially worse than outcomes for <b>children</b> <b>reared</b> in traditional nuclear families. We conclude that, as a description of the data, the crucial distinction is between <b>children</b> <b>reared</b> in traditional nuclear families (i. e., families in which all children are the joint biological children of both parents) and <b>children</b> <b>reared</b> in other family structures (e. g., single-parent families or blended families). The paper's second contribution is to clarify the question, What is the effect of family structure on outcomes for children?' Interpreted literally, the question asks about the effect of one endogenous variable on another. We argue for reformulating the family structure question by specifying some explicit counterfactual, and express a preference for a policy-relevant counterfactual. As an example, we suggest considering the effect of reducing the marriage penalty' in the earned-income tax credit (EITC) that makes the credit essentially unavailable to two-earner couples. The EITC marriage penalty counterfactual, like any policy-relevant counterfactual, focuses attention on outcomes for those children whose parent's behavior is affected by the incentives created by the policy change. ...|$|R
25|$|Kelly and Hauck's {{research}} found that divisions of labor within a same-sex relationship {{can not be}} viewed as setting a precedent as to what gender roles are normal. A female partner in a same-sex relationship may perform chores that are considered feminine, like cooking, cleaning, and <b>child</b> <b>rearing.</b> However, the other female partner may perform chores that are considered masculine, like outside work and employment outside of the home. The partners’ behaviors do not support gender roles because all the roles performed are done by women. There is not an inherent distinction made between masculine and feminine because women are performing both types of chores. This lack of gender role discrimination would be true in same-sex relationships between two men as well.|$|E

In Dec. 1958 – January 1959 the first seven-day school in Kenya was held near Kimilili in western Kenya covering topics on Bahá'í administration, Bahá'í history and Bahá'í teachings. Correspondence courses followed by June. By December there was progress in getting permanent centers established from among the assemblies. Extraordinary number of enrollments in Uganda and Kenya had reached {{the point that the}} institution of the Hands of the Cause were noting there were not enough Baha'is {{to keep up with the}} work of checking the enrollments. In the case of Kenya, almost nearly twelve hundred people joined the religion in less than a year. Four regional conferences on the progress of the religion and weekend schools were held by early 1960. Hand of the Cause Musa Banani was the first Hand to visit Kenya in early 1960. Nine Kenyans were among the attendees at advanced training in 1960 though classes now used chapters from Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era by John Esslemont while in November 1960 Hands of the Cause John Robarts and Rahmatu'lláh Muhájir toured Kenya leading up to the dedication of the mother Bahá'í House of Worship of Africa in Uganda in January 1961. Kenyans were among the over 1500 people who attended. Following the dedication, Hand of the Cause Ruhiyyih Khanum and chairman of the regional National Assembly Ali Nakhjavani embarked on 15 days of visiting Bahá'ís through Uganda and Kenya including seeing three regional conferences on the progress of the religion, staying in homes of fellow believers, and other events. Khanum talked to audiences about the future of African Bahá'ís and their role in the religion. The convention for the 1961 election of the regional national assembly of central and east Africa included 35 delegates from Kenya. In September 1961 a permanent Bahá'í school was set up in Kenya where courses emphasized homecraft and <b>child</b> <b>rearing</b> mixed with presentations on the religion and men supported women taking the courses. News of the openings was covered in Jet Magazine. By the end of 1961 conversions among pygmies brought the membership of the community to about 4000 and a total of 134 assemblies. Samandari was elected to the regional National Spiritual Assembly of North East Africa (1961–70) before moving to Cameroon where she later died. In 1962 the Kenyan government took steps to officially recognize Bahá'í holy days for employees. In May Hand of the Cause Enoch Olinga visited for one week in Kenya as part of an extended tour of many African countries. He spoke in Tiriki, Nandi, Nyangore, Kisii, Nairobi, Mombasa and Wundanyi. He then returned in August for another week's stay this time in Kabras. In October in addition to the permanent school weekend courses were offered emphasizing homecraft and <b>child</b> <b>rearing</b> mixed with presentations on the religion in Malakisi and Kimilili, while a permanent center was opened in South Kabras.|$|E
