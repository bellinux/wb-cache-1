To identify immunological markers associated with chlamydial infection and disease in koalas, we used koala-specific Quantitative Real Time PCR (qrtPCR) assays to profile the cytokine responses of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) collected from 41 koalas with different stages of <b>chlamydial</b> <b>disease.</b> Target cytokines included the principal Th 1 (Interferon gamma; IFNγ), Th 2 (Interleukin 10; IL 10), and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha; TNFα). A novel koala-specific IL 17 A qrtPCR assay was also developed as part of this study to quantitate the gene expression of this Th 17 cytokine in koalas. A statistically significant higher IL 17 A gene expression was observed in animals with current <b>chlamydial</b> <b>disease</b> compared to animals with asymptomatic chlamydial infection. A modest up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα and IFNγ, was also observed in these animals with signs of current <b>chlamydial</b> <b>disease.</b> IL 10 gene expression was not evident in the majority of animals from both groups.

40|$|The {{virulence}} of {{chlamydial infection}} in wild koalas is highly variable between individuals. Some koalas can be infected (PCR positive) with Chlamydia {{for long periods}} but remain asymptomatic, whereas others develop clinical disease. Chlamydia in the koala has traditionally been studied without regard to coinfection with other pathogens, although koalas are usually subject to infection with koala retrovirus (KoRV). Retroviruses can be immunosuppressive, and {{there is evidence of}} an immunosuppressive effect of KoRV in vitro. Originally thought to be a single endogenous strain, a new, potentially more virulent exogenous variant (KoRV-B) was recently reported. We hypothesized that KoRV-B might significantly alter <b>chlamydial</b> <b>disease</b> outcomes in koalas, presumably via immunosuppression. By studying sub-groups of Chlamydia and KoRV infected koalas in the wild, we found that neither total KoRV load (either viraemia or proviral copies per genome), nor chlamydial infection level or strain type, was significantly associated with <b>chlamydial</b> <b>disease</b> risk. However, PCR positivity with KoRV-B was significantly associated with <b>chlamydial</b> <b>disease</b> in koalas (p[*]=[*] 0. 02961).

40|$|Chlamydiaceae is {{a family}} of obligate {{intracellular}} bacteria generally considered energy parasites.

40|$|<b>Chlamydial</b> <b>disease</b> {{continues}} {{to be one of}} the main factors threatening the long-term survival of the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus). Despite this, large epidemiological studies of chlamydial infection and disease in wild koala populations are lacking. A better understanding of the prevalence, transmission and pathogenesis is needed to improve control measures, such as the development of vaccines. We investigated the prevalence of Chlamydia pecorum infection and disease in 160 koalas in a peri-urban wild population in Queensland, Australia and found that 31 % of koalas were Chlamydia PCR positive and 28 % had clinically detectable <b>chlamydial</b> <b>disease.</b> Most infections were at the urogenital site (27 %; both males and females) with only 14 % at the ocular site. Interestingly, we found that 27 % (4 / 15) of koalas considered to be sexually immature (9 - 13 months) were already infected with C. pecorum, suggesting that a significant percentage of animals are infected directly from their mother. Ocular infection levels were less prevalent with increasing age (8 % in koalas older than 4 years), whereas the prevalence of urogenital tract infections remained high into older age (26 % in koalas older than 4 years), suggesting that, after mother-to-young transmission, C. pecorum is predominantly a sexually transmitted infection. While 28 % of koalas in this population had clinically detectable <b>chlamydial</b> <b>disease</b> (primarily urogenital tract disease), many PCR positive koalas had no detectable disease and importantly, not all diseased animals were PCR positive. We also observed higher chlamydial loads in koalas who were C. pecorum infected without clinical disease than in koalas who were C. pecorum infected with clinical disease.

The clinical and histological findings were consistent with those of a delayed hypersensitivity response. These data demonstrated that the 57 -kD chlamydial protein was a potent stimulator of ocular delayed hypersensitivity.

40|$|Summary: In recent years, {{there has}} been a renewed effort to study swine chlamydiae, both because there is an {{increased}} awareness of <b>chlamydial</b> <b>diseases</b> and because we now have improved methods of isolation. Six different strains of chlamydiae have been isolated from cases of enteritis, pneumonia, and conjunctivitis in nursing, nursery, and finishing pigs. These isolates are all of the C. trachomatis type and are similar to the hu-man C. trachomatis strains. However, molecular characterization has de-termined that they are distinctly different from the human strains.

40|$|Many wild koalas are {{infected}} with the koala retrovirus, KoRV, some of which suffer from lymphoma and <b>chlamydial</b> <b>disease.</b> Three subgroups, KoRV-A, KoRV-B and KoRV-J, have so far been described. It {{is well known that}} other closely related gammaretroviruses can induce tumours and severe immunodeficiencies in their respective hosts and a possible role for KoRV infection in lymphoma and <b>chlamydial</b> <b>disease</b> in koalas has been suggested. In many wild koalas, KoRV-A has become endogenised, i. e., it is integrated in the germ-line and is passed on with normal cellular genes. In this study, sera from koalas in European zoos and from wild animals in Australia were screened for antibodies against KoRV-A. These naturally infected animals all carry endogenous KoRV-A and two zoo animals are also infected with KoRV-B. The antibody response is generally an important diagnostic tool for detecting retrovirus infections. However, when Western blot analyses were performed using purified virus or recombinant proteins corresponding to KoRV-A, none of the koalas tested positive for specific antibodies, suggesting a state of tolerance. These results have implications for koala vaccination, as they suggest that therapeutic immunisation of animals carrying and expressing endogenous KoRV-A will not be successful. However, it remains unclear whether these animals can be immunised against KoRV-B and immunisation of uninfected koalas could still be worthwhile...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{previously}} reported that although inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene knockout (NOS 2 −/−) mice resolve Chlamydia trachomatis genital infection, the production of reactive nitrogen species (RNS) via iNOS protects {{a significant proportion of}} mice from hydrosalpinx formation and infertility. We now report that higher in vivo RNS production correlates with mouse strain-related innate resistance to hydrosalpinx formation. We also show that mice with a deletion of a key component of phagocyte NADPH oxidase (p 47 phox−/−) resolve infection, produce greater amounts of RNS in vivo, and sustain lower rates of hydrosalpinx formation than both wild-type (WT) NOS 2 +/+ and NOS 2 −/− controls. When we induced an in vivo chemical block in iNOS activity in p 47 phox−/− mice using NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (L-NMMA), a large proportion of these mice eventually succumbed to opportunistic infections, but not before they resolved their chlamydial infections. Interestingly, when compared to WT and untreated p 47 phox−/− controls, L-NMMA-treated p 47 phox−/− mice resolved their infections more rapidly. However, L-NMMA-treated p 47 phox−/− mice lost resistance to chronic <b>chlamydial</b> <b>disease,</b> as evidenced by an increased rate of hydrosalpinx formation that was comparable to that for NOS 2 −/− mice. We conclude that phagocyte oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulate RNS during chlamydial urogenital infection in the mouse.

In this review, we provide {{an overview of}} the current knowledge on the role of NKT cells in host defense against and pathogenesis due to Chlamydia, which is an intracellular bacterial pathogen that poses a threat to the public health worldwide. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that NKT cells, particularly invariant NKT (iNKT) cells, {{play a crucial role in}} host defense against chlamydial infections, especially in C. pneumoniae infection. iNKT cells can promote type- 1 protective responses to C. pneumoniae by inducing enhanced production of IL- 12 by dendritic cells (DCs), in particular CD 8 α+ DCs, which promote the differentiation of naive T cells into protective IFN-γ-producing Th 1 /Tc 1 type CD 4 +/CD 8 + T cells. This iNKT-cell-mediated modulation of DC function is largely dependent upon CD 40 -CD 40 L interaction, IFN-γ production and cell-to-cell contact. In addition, iNKT cells modulate the function of NK cells. NKT cells may be also involved in the pathogenesis of some <b>chlamydial</b> <b>diseases</b> by inducing different patterns of cytokine production. A better understanding of NKT-cell biology will enable us to rationally design prophylactic and therapeutic tools to combat infectious diseases...|$|R

We detected C. pecorum in ocular or urogenital swabs from 57 koalas (88 %), and 34 koalas were positive at both ocular and urogenital sites.

40|$|Debilitating {{infectious}} diseases caused by Chlamydia are major {{contributors to the}} decline of Australia’s iconic native marsupial species, the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus). An understanding of koala <b>chlamydial</b> <b>disease</b> pathogenesis {{and the development of}} effective strategies to control infections continue to be hindered by an almost complete lack of species-specific immunological reagents. The cell-mediated immune response has been shown to play an influential role in the response to chlamydial infection in other hosts. The objective of this study, hence, was to provide preliminary data on the role of two key cytokines, pro-inflammatory tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) and anti-inflammatory interleukin 10 (IL 10), in the koala Chlamydia pecorum response. Utilising sequence homology between the cytokine sequences obtained from several recently sequenced marsupial genomes, this report describes the first mRNA sequences of any koala cytokine and the development of koala specific TNFa and IL 10 real-time PCR assays to measure the expression of these genes from koala samples.

Following intranasal C. pneumoniae challenge, C 57 BL/ 6 mice on a low-protein/low-antioxidant diet, but not C 57 BL/ 6 mice on other diets or A/J mice, exhibited profoundly suppressed early lung inflammatory and pan-T-cell (CD 3 δ+) and helper T-cell (CD 45) responses on day 3 but later strongly exacerbated disease on day 10. Contrast analyses characterized severe C. pneumoniae disease as being a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response with increased lung macrophage and Th 1 cell marker transcripts, increased Th 1 :Th 2 ratios, and Th 1 cytokine-driven inflammation.

40|$|Chlamydiae are {{bacteria}} {{commonly found}} in the environment of human life and they cause many <b>diseases.</b> <b>Chlamydial</b> infections are common among men and women, although they are more often diagnosed in women and they are frequently asymptomatic, due to the biology of chlamydiae. Incorrectly diagnosed and untreated, they cause many complications {{which can lead to}} infertility in both, men and women. This work presents the diseases caused by chlamydiae of the urogenitary tract, including environmental chlamydiae, so far in Polish literature rarely presented, which extends the panel responsible for <b>chlamydial</b> genital tract <b>disease,</b> particularly in women. A major problem is that the knowledge of the immune mechanisms that occur in the case of infection with these bacteria, especially in view of prevention of these infection, mainly in the context of creation of the vaccine. Also important fact from the knowledge of immunity in chlamydiosis is base for diagnosis of these infection...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Quinolone {{resistance}} of chlamydiae {{is supposed to}} be extremely rare. To assess the risk for the emergence of chlamydial quinolone resistance, we analysed the occurrence of resistant mutants in a quantitative perspective. Methods: Infectious elementary bodies of Chlamydia trachomatis serovar L 2 (ATCC VR- 902 B) and D (ATTC VR- 885) clones were purified on density gradients, and mutants resistant to moxifloxacin and rifampicin were selected by a plaque assay. Plaque assays were conducted with 2 3 109 inclusion forming units (IFUs) of each serovar for rifampicin and 2. 66 3 109 IFUs for moxifloxacin. Resistant clones were analysed for mutations in the gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE genes, and respective MICs were determined by titration experiments. Results: Mutation frequencies for rifampicin (MIC 0. 2 mg/L) did not differ significantly between sero-vars L 2 and D (5. 7 3 10 27 versus 6. 3 3 1027). In contrast, the occurrence of moxifloxacin-resistant mutants (MIC 0. 6 mg/L) was determined to be 2. 0 – 2. 2 3 1028 for the serovar L 2 isolate and less than 2. 66 3 1029 for the serovar D isolate. Moxifloxacin {{resistance of}} all serovar L 2 clones depended on single-nucleotide point mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining region of the gyrA, whereas no additional mutations were found in the gyrB, parC or parE genes. Conclusions: C. trachomatis isolates have the potential to present with clinically relevant antibiotic resistance in future. Serovar-specific differences in the occurrence of spontaneous mutations should be taken into account to predict quinolone resistance in different <b>chlamydial</b> <b>diseases...</b>|$|R
