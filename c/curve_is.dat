5|$|As {{the points}} of any smooth simple closed curve move in this way, the curve remains simple and smooth. It loses area at a {{constant}} rate, and its perimeter decreases {{as quickly as possible}} for any continuous curve evolution. If the <b>curve</b> <b>is</b> non-convex, its total absolute curvature decreases monotonically, until it becomes convex. Once convex, the isoperimetric ratio of the curve decreases as the curve converges to a circular shape, before collapsing to a single point of singularity. If two disjoint simple smooth closed curves evolve, they remain disjoint until one of them collapses to a point.|$|E

5|$|For {{a simple}} closed curve, using an {{extension}} of the flow to non-smooth curves based on the level set method, there are only two possibilities. Curves with zero Lebesgue measure (including all polygons and piecewise-smooth curves) instantly evolve into smooth curves, after which they evolve as any smooth curve would. However, Osgood curves with nonzero measure instead immediately evolve into a topological annulus with nonzero area and smooth boundaries. The topologist's sine <b>curve</b> <b>is</b> an example that instantly becomes smooth, despite not even being locally connected; examples such as this show that the reverse evolution of the curve-shortening flow can take well-behaved curves to complicated singularities in a finite amount of time.|$|E

5|$|In {{the context}} of a PPF, {{opportunity}} cost {{is directly related to the}} shape of the curve (see below). If the shape of the PPF <b>curve</b> <b>is</b> a straight-line, the opportunity cost is constant as production of different goods is changing. But, opportunity cost usually will vary depending on the start and end points. In the diagram on the right, producing 10 more packets of butter, at a low level of butter production, costs the loss of 5 guns (shown as a movement from A to B). At point C, the economy is already close to its maximum potential butter output. To produce 10 more packets of butter, 50 guns must be sacrificed (as with a movement from C to D). The ratio of gains to losses is determined by the marginal rate of transformation.|$|E
5|$|Paleontologist Gregory Erickson {{and colleagues}} {{have studied the}} growth and life history of tyrannosaurids. Analysis of bone {{histology}} can determine the age of a specimen when it died. Growth rates can be examined when the age of various individuals are plotted against their size on a graph.

After the rapid growth phase ended with sexual maturity, growth slowed down considerably in adult animals. A tyrannosaurid growth <b>curve</b> <b>is</b> S-shaped, with the maximum growth rate of individuals around 14 years of age.|$|E
5|$|With {{a greater}} degree of {{certainty}} established, the Kepler team compared the models formed using Blender to the photometric observations collected by the Kepler satellite. The Blender technique allowed the Kepler team to rule out the majority of the alternatives including, notably, that of triple star systems. Blender then allowed the Kepler team to determine that although all models representing hierarchical triple stars (a binary system between a single star and a double star) can resemble the light curve of Kepler-10, the aforementioned follow-up observations would have detected them all. The only possible blends remaining after ruling out hierarchical triple stars was that of determining if the <b>curve</b> <b>is</b> caused by interference from a background star, or if it is indeed caused by the orbit of a transiting planet.|$|E
