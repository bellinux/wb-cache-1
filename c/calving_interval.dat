40|$|AbstractThe {{objectives}} {{of the present study}} were to determine if variance components of <b>calving</b> <b>intervals</b> varied with age at calving and if considering <b>calving</b> <b>intervals</b> as a longitudinal trait would be a useful approach for fertility analysis of Zebu dairy herds. With these purposes, calving records from females born from 1940 to 2006 in a Guzerat dairy subpopulation in Brazil were analyzed. The fixed effects of contemporary groups, formed by year and farm at birth or at calving, and the regressions of age at calving, equivalent inbreeding coefficient and day of the year on the studied traits were considered in the statistical models. In one approach, <b>calving</b> <b>intervals</b> (CI) were analyzed as a single trait, by fitting a statistical model on which both animal and permanent environment effects were adjusted for the effect of age at calving by random regression. In a second approach, a four-trait analysis was conducted, including age at first calving (AFC) and three different female categories for the calving intervals: first calving females; young females (less than 80 months old, but not first calving); or mature females (80 months old or more). Finally, a two-trait analysis was performed, also including AFC and CI, but <b>calving</b> <b>intervals</b> were regarded as a single trait in a repeatability model. Additionally, the ranking of sires was compared among approaches. <b>Calving</b> <b>intervals</b> decreased with age until females were about 80 months old, remaining nearly constant after that age. A quasi-linear increase of 11. 5 days on the <b>calving</b> <b>intervals</b> was observed for each 10 % increase in the female's equivalent inbreeding coefficient. The heritability of AFC was 0. 37.

40|$|Prolonged or delayed {{interval}} {{to first}} breeding {{is a major}} cause of long <b>calving</b> <b>intervals.</b> Our objective was to test two methods of artificial insemination by appointment after controlling the onset of estrus for all first breedings after calving. Prostaglandin F 2 α (PGF) was used to time the onset of estrus for cows in two experimental groups. Control cows (inseminated at first heat after 42 days postpartum) had longer intervals to first breeding than the two experimental groups given PCF at 40 to 46 and 51 to 57 days postpartum.

A major constraint to milk production and number of calves born from the cows is the long <b>calving</b> <b>intervals.</b> Determining non-pregnant cows early by measuring progesterone levels by day 23 after insemination can help reduce <b>calving</b> <b>intervals,</b> thus improving productivity. A sample of 481 cows was inseminated and 10 ml milk samples collected from each cow on day 0, 13 and 23 after insemination to determine progesterone levels using radioimmunoassay and using I 125 as the tracer. This was to determine timeliness of artificial insemination (AI), cyclicity and pregnancy by day 24 after AI. Rectal palpation was done 90 days after insemination to confirm hormone predictions for non-pregnancy. Conception rates of 53 % were recorded. Mean progesterone levels were 0, 5. 3 and 10. 1 nm/litre at the three stages of sampling respectively for pregnant cows, while non-pregnant cows recorded 0. 59, 2. 69, 0. 46 nm/litres respectively. Of cows inseminated at the right time, 38 % did not conceive, showing a problem of cyclicity or early embryonic loss. Embryonic loss was recorded in 32 % of non-pregnant cows. The post-partum period averaged 5 months. Breeds were similar for conception while cows inseminated during April to June had higher conceptions than those of July to September.

This means Lei 8. 59 additional income per cow and <b>calving</b> <b>interval</b> day longer than 400 days...|$|E
40|$|Is {{generally}} known {{there is}} antagonistic relationship between production and reproduction traits. We observed this relationship in dataset of 1 197 478 daily milk records of Holstein cows {{on the first}} lactation only, first time calved during years 2003 - 2009. We found increased milk production and prolonged <b>calving</b> <b>interval</b> during this period. We observed highest milk production (7604 kg) on standardized 1 st lactation for cows with longest <b>calving</b> <b>interval</b> in compare to cows with shortest <b>calving</b> <b>interval</b> (7079 kg). Positive significant correlation (0. 56775, P< 0. 0001) was found between standardized milk production and <b>calving</b> <b>interval.</b> It means that cows with higher milk production have a prolonged <b>calving</b> <b>interval,</b> which confirms antagonist relationship between production and reproduction traits. Significant negative correlation (- 0. 27695, P< 0. 0001) observed between percent of protein production on standardized lactation and <b>calving</b> <b>interval</b> suggests that prolonged <b>calving</b> <b>interval</b> has negative effect on daily protein production (%) in milk. Coefficient of determination between breeding values for milk production and length of <b>calving</b> <b>interval</b> was 0. 6434. Following these results we should accept relationship between production and reproduction and include it in process of genetic evaluation of cattle...|$|E

40|$|Milk {{production}} in Malawi is stagnating although neighbouring countries steadily increase outputs. In this paper, we explored {{the determinants of}} the performance of dairy smallholders. As indicators of on-farm performance we used annual milk yield, <b>calving</b> <b>intervals,</b> and annual dairy income. Regression models revealed that milk yield was negatively related with farmer’s age, female farmer, and household size, but positively influenced by farmers’ experience. <b>Calving</b> <b>intervals</b> were strongly associated with labour costs and breeding method. Income from dairying was only associated with farmers’ education but varied strongly with region. Regional effects existed for all performance indicators which may partly be rooted in land scarcity in the south and the efforts of development agencies to promote dairying in the northern and central regions. Results also revealed a tendency for pure breeds to produce higher outputs, but crossbreeds due to lower costs provided better income. Thus, we recommend that experienced farmers become involved in extension programs to provide comprehensive services that help farmers make more efficient use of their scarce assets, and thus realise more of the animals’ genetic potential with regard to the three observed performance indicators...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of reproductive data on White Fulani (Bunaji) Zebu cattl of Northern Nigeria was carried out. The season and {{year of birth}} {{had no effect on}} age at first calving (P> 0. 1). The mean age at first calving was 40. 4 ± 0. 7 months. The distribution of heifers, classified according to age at first calving, appeared to be normal. Subsequent <b>calving</b> <b>intervals</b> for heifers that had their first calf in the dry and wet seasons were 458 and 540 days, respectively. The difference was highly significant (...|$|R
