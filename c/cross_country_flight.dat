50|$|The sole IAR-23 built was {{registered}} YR-IAR. {{and delivered}} to Major G. Bănciulescu in September 1934, who undertook several <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>flights</b> with the aircraft through Europe (from Bucharest to Warsaw, Prague and Vienna). The next year, the IAR-23 was flown to Tel-Aviv and back.|$|R
50|$|The Lippisch Wien {{was a high}} {{performance}} glider designed by Alexander Lippisch in Germany in 1929. Owned and flown by Robert Kronfeld, {{it was one of}} the first sailplanes intended to exploit thermals. It set world records both for distance and altitude and demonstrated the practicality of long distance <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>flights.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 20 February 1911 J J Hammond {{flew the}} first <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>flight</b> between towns in Australia from Altona Bay to Geelong in Victoria, and on 23 February, also at Altona Bay in Victoria, he {{undertook}} the first powered passenger flight in Australia.|$|E

50|$|The CH 640 was {{developed}} from the two-seat type certified AMD Alarus, also called the Zenair CH 2000, by increasing the span of the wings and stabilator, to accommodate the larger engine and increase in gross weight. The design was also influenced by the Zenith CH 601 and the Zenair CH 300. The design goals were to produce a simple four-seat aircraft capable of flying <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>flights</b> with full seats.|$|R
50|$|National Air Transport {{was a large}} United States airline. It was {{the first}} airline to operate <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>flights.</b> In 1930 it was bought by Boeing. The Air Mail Act of 1934 {{prohibited}} airlines and manufacturers from being under the same corporate umbrella, so Boeing split into three smaller companies, {{one of which is}} United Airlines, and it is this that included what had previously been National Air Transport.|$|R
5000|$|One {{reviewer}} of the CT2K writing COPA Flight in October 2004 {{described the}} aircraft as [...] "fast, comfortable, roomy and very capable of long <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>flights</b> for little money" [...] and faulted the aircraft {{only for its}} difficulty slowing down from its cruise speed of 130 knots to its final approach speed of 50 knots, requiring careful planning to lose 80 knots between entering the circuit and stabilizing the aircraft on final approach.|$|R
50|$|Pazmany {{then joined}} the legendary Claude Ryan (Lindbergh’s Spirit Of St. Louis is {{credited}} to Ryan) {{and his son}} in developing the Ryson ST-100 Cloudster, a tandem two seat motor glider that was intended for <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>flight</b> and as the latest contribution to Ryan’s pioneering tradition in the San Diego aviation industry.|$|E
50|$|Mount Ascutney is {{the premier}} hang gliding site in New England. Notable for its {{excellent}} soaring, {{it is not}} unusual for hang gliders to fly from Mt. Ascutney to nearby states. Some trips can stretch to the New Hampshire or Massachusetts coastline, a flight of over 90 miles. The record <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>flight</b> from Mt. Ascutney is held by Curt Warren who flew 131.6 mi into Connecticut on August 7, 2002.|$|E
50|$|The {{test results}} {{proved that the}} {{aircraft}} possessed good flying characteristics as well as meeting performance specifications. During a <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>flight,</b> from Córdoba to Buenos Aires, the Ñancú reached a level speed of 780 km/h, setting a new piston engined speed record in South America, an achievement {{that has not been}} surpassed. Although the prototype was achieving design goals, the Fuerza Aérea Argentina was already considering the jet I.Ae. 27 Pulqui I as their future fighter program.|$|E
50|$|The Schneider ES-57 Kingfisher {{is a low}} cost, short span Australian glider {{capable of}} respectable <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> soaring <b>flights.</b> It was {{produced}} in small numbers in the late 1950s.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, {{a person}} {{must have a}} minimum of 40 hours of flight {{instruction}} {{in order to obtain}} a private pilot's license. The forty hours is divided between time spent with the instructor actually in the aircraft ("dual instruction") and with the student practicing maneuvers and <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>flights</b> alone ("solo"). While there are some persons who have obtained their license with only the minimum hours required, most successful candidates complete their checkride between 50 and 65 hours.|$|R
40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} observations {{were made on}} the Loran-C in general aviation aircraft. The evaluation of Loran-C for both <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>flights</b> and nonprecision approaches was conducted under simulated instrument flight rules conditions. Particular {{emphasis was placed on}} the reliability and failure of Loran-C equipment as well as its susceptibility to atmospheric effects such as P static. Efforts were made to quantify the long term stability of the Loran-C time difference grid. Several E field antenna configurations were also evaluated in terms of performance. Significant results are reported...|$|R
5000|$|The {{distinctive}} {{side curtains}} between the outer {{two sets of}} interplane struts that were to become characteristic of subsequent production aircraft were added to both aircraft {{by the end of}} September. [...] By 30 October, when Farman made a 27 km flight from Buoy to Reims, the first <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>flight</b> in aviation history, ailerons had been added to his aircraft. [...] Farmans last modification was to fit a third, shorter wing, in which form it became known as the Henry Farman Triplane.|$|E
50|$|Flight {{training}} {{is available from}} most flight schools around the UK. Instruction is given by qualified PPL flight instructors - there is no separate or reduced grading for NPPL instructors themselves. A minimum of 25 hours flying time is required (for microlight aircraft, 32 for light aircraft), of which at least 10 hours must be solo. The solo flight time must include 4 hours of cross country which may include the solo qualifying <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>flight</b> of at least 100 nm with two landings away. A further 2 to 3 hours flying time should be allowed for the two practical tests that follow.|$|E
50|$|Washington first sent {{delegates to}} Miss America in 1926 and 1927 with Leona Fengler, Miss Seattle. She was {{sponsored}} by the Seattle Times (a practice common {{in the early days of}} the Miss America Pageant). She was pictured by the paper leaving in a bi-plane for her <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>flight</b> to Atlantic City where she was voted 'Prettiest Girl in an Evening Gown'. Featured in the Seattle Museum of History and Industry in the exhibit 'Puttin on the Ritz' a 1920s display. In 1987, Leona was welcomed home and featured once again at the newly revived Miss Seattle Pageant that year.|$|E
50|$|With {{the end of}} the war, Vernam Field {{was reduced}} in scope to a {{skeleton}} staff. By the end of 1946 only two aircraft, a C-45 and a C-47 were assigned to the station with both aircraft being down for parts and minimal maintenance being undertaken. It was placed under the command of the 24th Composite Wing, Headquartered at Borinquen AFB, Puerto Rico. The airfield became a training destination for early jet aircraft <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>flights,</b> with P-80 Shooting Stars, F-84 Thunderjets and early F-86A Sabres using its long wartime bomber runways.|$|R
5000|$|Short-field landing {{recommended}} for RWY 14. Obstacles (trees, houses, mosque) surrounding airfield {{from the north}} and high terrain elevation from the south. Airfield is used by a local flight academy, causing constant departures and arrivals of Cessna 172s and Piper PA-44 Seminoles, some are piloted by solo students. Information service is attended erratically. This airport is usually used for Mutual <b>Cross</b> <b>Country</b> <b>flights</b> to east Bali and back. The airport's frequency is 122.55 and the airports call sign is 'Wisnu Info'. The Airport is generally open from Monday to Saturday around the times 00:00-09:00 UTC.|$|R
5000|$|On 3 March 1911, Benjamin Foulois and Philip Orin Parmelee {{flew the}} US military's first <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> {{reconnaissance}} <b>flight</b> here from Laredo using a Wright Model B covering 106 miles {{in two hours}} {{at an altitude of}} 800 feet.|$|R
5000|$|... 12-18 July 1944: The {{squadron}} received {{orders to}} NAS Alameda, California, {{in preparation for}} a trans-Pacific flight to the South Paciﬁc. The midpoint landing area during the <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>ﬂight</b> for most of the squadron was at Eagle Mountain Lake, Texas, where a temporary refueling and minor maintenance depot had been positioned. The last aircraft arrived at NAS Alameda on the 18th, and all hands engaged in aircraft maintenance and stowage of equipment/spares in the aircraft for use in the war zone. During the period of preparation for the trans-Pacific the squadron came under the control of FAW-8.|$|E
5000|$|ARA {{serves as}} a {{helicopter}} flight training location for several companies and is also used {{on a regular basis}} by NASA, the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy as a <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>flight</b> training destination. Air Force T-1A Jayhawk (which is a military flight training version of the Hawker 400 business jet) and Navy T-45 Goshawk jet trainers are frequent visitors to the airfield while NASA T-38 Talon supersonic jet trainers visit the airport on occasion as well. [...] U.S. Navy F/A-18 Hornet supersonic fighter-attack jets from VFA-204 based at the Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base New Orleans also visit ARA on occasion on a repeated basis.|$|E
5000|$|In June 1934, Reitsch {{became a}} member of the Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Segelflug (DFS) and became a test pilot in 1935. Reitsch {{enrolled}} in the Civil Airways Training School in Stettin, where she flew a twin-engine on a <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>flight</b> and aerobatics in a Focke-Wulf Fw 44. In 1937, Ernst Udet gave Reitsch the honorary title of [...] "Flugkapitän" [...] after she had successfully tested Hans Jacobs' divebrakes for gliders.At the DFS she test flew transport and troop-carrying gliders, including the DFS 230 used at the Battle of Fort Eben-Emael.In September 1937, Reitsch was posted to the Luftwaffe testing centre at Rechlin-Lärz Airfield by Ernst Udet.|$|E
2500|$|About 1931 the glider {{manufacturer}} Alexander Schleicher went to Hans Jacobs, {{then at the}} RRG (Rhön-Rossitten Gesellschaft) on the Wasserkuppe, for a glider design that, {{like the}} RRG Fafnir designed by Alexander Lippisch, {{would be capable of}} making long <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>flights</b> by travelling quickly between thermals but could be put into series production making it cheaper to build. [...] Jacobs responded with the Rhönadler (in English, Rhön eagle), ready for the 1932 Rhön competition. [...] The following year both Jacobs and Lippisch had to transfer to the state owned DFS (Deutsche Forschungsanstalt Für Segelflug) at Darmstadt, where Jacobs continued to refine the Rhönbussard, hence the DFS Rhönadler name.|$|R
50|$|Model {{optimized}} for <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> powered <b>flight</b> with shorter wing of 10.39 m and a NACA 4415 airfoil {{used in the}} rectangular portion of the wing and a NACA 2R1-12 airfoil in the tapered wing tip. Cruises at 135 km/h and has a 10:1 glide ratio. One reported completed in 2003.|$|R
2500|$|The Luftwaffe {{became aware}} of Horten's work during tests of the Horten H.V, a twin engine {{aircraft}} with military potential, and ordered three more Horten II motorgliders. Designated Horten H.IIL, they had slightly increased washout and a more upright seat. The pilot's head was now above the wing under a [...] high clear perspex canopy. [...] The alterations increased the weight by [...] The first two of these were built in 1937 and {{the decision was made}} to enter them as gliders in the annual Rhön contest. [...] Their performance there were not outstanding as their wing loading was too low to reach the speeds necessary for rapid <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>flights</b> between thermals.|$|R
