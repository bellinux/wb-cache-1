50|$|In woodturning, one {{variation}} {{of a live}} <b>center</b> is a <b>cup</b> <b>center,</b> which is a cone of metal surrounded by an annular ring of metal that decreases the chances of the workpiece splitting.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>cup</b> <b>centers.</b> The {{woodworking}} variety is a variation of the traditional live center. This type of <b>cup</b> <b>center</b> has a central point like a normal live center and also has a ring surrounding it. The ring supports the softer material around the center point and prevents the wood from splitting under pressure from the central point. A different variety of <b>cup</b> <b>center</b> is used for metalworking. The metalworking variety of <b>cup</b> <b>center</b> has a tapered hole rather than a conical point. It supports the part by making contact with the outside diameter {{of the end of the}} part, rather than using a center hole.|$|R
2500|$|The cup {{involves}} three players, {{arranged in}} a semi-circular cup-shaped formation, one {{in the middle and}} back, the other two on the sides and forward. One of the side players marks the handler with a force, while the other two guard the open side. Therefore, the handler will normally have to throw into the cup, allowing the defenders to more easily make blocks. With a <b>cup,</b> usually the <b>center</b> <b>cup</b> blocks the up-field lane to cutters, while the side cup blocks the cross-field swing pass to other handlers. The <b>center</b> <b>cup</b> usually also has the responsibility to call out which of the two sides should mark the thrower, usually the defender closest to the sideline of the field. The idea of the cup is to force the offense into making many short passes behind and around the cup. The cup (except the marker) must also remember to stay 3 meters or more away from the offensive player with the disc. [...] The only time a player in the cups can come within 3 meters of the player with the disc is when another offensive player comes within 3 meters of the person with the disc, also known as [...] "crashing the cup".|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the reproducibility of ImageJ software {{in analyzing the}} color of the optic disc. Methods: One hundred twelve normal participants (56 males and 56 females) were enrolled in this study. The image of the optic disc was taken using Kowa digital disc photo-graphy, and the gray scales of the nasal rim (NR), brightest <b>cupping</b> <b>center</b> (BCC) and largest inferior retinal vein (IRV) were calculated using histogram in ImageJ. Three different observers calculated the gray scales three separate times. Reproducibility was assessed using the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results: The mean age of the participants was 50. 6 years old (range, 11 to 82 years). The mean gray scales of the nasal rim were 91. 81, 94. 91, and 93. 24; those of the brightest <b>cupping</b> <b>center</b> were 174. 84, 179. 94, and 177. 76; and those of the largest inferior retinal vein were 61. 85, 53. 48, and 56. 73 for observers 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Inter-observer reproducibility for NR, BCC and IRV was considered good based upon ICC values of 0. 944, 0. 860, and 0. 789 for observers 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Significant age-related differences between the values of the brightest <b>cupping</b> <b>center</b> were noted, and the gray scale score was decreased in the older participants (p < 0. 001). Conclusions: The gray scale of the brightest <b>cupping</b> <b>center</b> diminished with age.

40|$|Scouting is a lifestyle. Scouts are mates, {{friends and}} the {{community}} of people who share similar values. Growing up in a scout section is to seize the chance to live fully, to be active and find their own place in the world. Scouting is an offered opportunity for developping not only themselves but also their surroundings. Scouts {{try to create a}} better world by taking their lives into their own hands. Scouting works universally on the personality development of children and young people, through games, experiences, activities and other work. The aim of this work is to explore the issues shaping the social climate in scout sections in relation to the leadership style of the group. The theoretical part provides general information about scouting, pedagogical - psychological aspects of social groups, group leadership styles, influences on the formation of the social climate in the group with regard to the specificity of the scout groups.

40|$|The {{reproducibility}} of cupping {{scores for}} 30 coffee samples from eastern, southern and southwestern origins in Ethiopia was evaluated by comparing absolute differences {{within and between}} nine cuppers, three Ethiopia Commodity Exchange (ECX) <b>cupping</b> <b>centers</b> (Jimma, Awassa, Dire Dawa) and three coffee origins. Additionally, the correlation between cupping scores of an exporter (ECX) and an importer (EFICO Agency SA) was evaluated based on 70 coffee samples from five different origins. Differences in ECX cupping score variability were generally observed for all studied quality attributes. Variability was higher between than within cuppers. Furthermore, particular high variable scores were observed for the Dire Dawa <b>cupping</b> <b>center</b> and for some attributes of the southwestern coffee origin. However, the average absolute difference for total cup quality was small (ca. 3 on a 100 scale), which indicates that cupping scores by the ECX are sufficiently reproducible to allow reliable coffee quality grading. However, no correlation was observed between cupping scores of the exporter and importer, which indicates a lack of interchangeability between grading data produced by both actors. Practical applications: Testing and grading {{of the quality of}} green coffee beans by the Ethiopia Commodity Exchange <b>cupping</b> <b>centers</b> is fairly reliable. However, the exporter quality scores and grades can most likely not be used interchangeably with those of an importer...|$|R

40|$|Advanced vision {{solutions}} enable {{manufacturers in}} the technology sector to reconcile both competitive and regulatory concerns and address the need for immaculate fault detection and quality assurance. The modern manufacturing has completely shifted from the manual inspections to the machine assisted vision inspection methodology. Furthermore, the research outcomes in industrial automation have revolutionized the whole product development strategy. The purpose of this research paper is to introduce a new scheme of automation in the sand casting process by means of machine vision based technology for mold positioning. Automation has been achieved by developing a novel system in which casting molds of different sizes, having different pouring cup location and radius, position themselves {{in front of the}} induction furnace such that the <b>center</b> of pouring <b>cup</b> comes directly beneath the pouring point of furnace.

50|$|Critics {{usually found}} the fourth {{generation}} acceptable. The car was praised for its adequate handling {{as well as}} a moderately comfortable ride. Other reviewers noted the car to be an ugly and somewhat expensive choice in the compact car segment, some simply referred to it as a Golf with a boot (trunk) on the back added as a last minute addition. Some complaints were made that the back seats lacked adequate room for two adults. Some found the seat cushioning too firm. The interior was praised for the high level of fit, but is quite bland, sparsely equipped, and uninspiring. New in this generation was Volkswagen's signature blue and red instrument lighting which became standard in all models in 1999. The climate controls were placed low on the console. The recirculation mode cannot be turned on when air is vented to the windshield, and if the driver changes the climate control to vent air to the windshield, an internal mechanism would turn off the recirculation mode. The power outlet is recessed next to the ash tray and is covered with two flaps, one of which is shared with the ash tray. Retractable cup holders were placed directly above the stereo, obscuring vision of the stereo display and allowing beverages to spill on the stereo, gear selector, and other sensitive components during erratic vehicle movements. The flimsy plastic construction of the retractable cup holder is likely to fail with normal use. Rear passengers have a pair of retractable cup holders located under the cylindrical ash tray on the center console. These problems were rectified in 2003 for the US market by placing two recessed cup holders in tandem in the center console and another behind the arm rest pedestal for rear passengers. The driver must raise the arm rest to access the <b>center</b> <b>cup</b> holder, and a large beverage occupying the front cup holder obstructs the driver's ability to pull the hand brake. European cars were given a redesigned retractable cup holder in front.|$|R
