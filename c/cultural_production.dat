25|$|Cultural {{protectionism}} in Canada has, {{since the}} mid-20th century, taken {{the form of}} conscious, interventionist attempts {{on the part of}} various Canadian governments to promote Canadian <b>cultural</b> <b>production.</b> Sharing a large border and (for the majority) a common language with the United States, Canada faces a difficult position in regard to American culture, be it direct attempts at the Canadian market or the general diffusion of American culture in the globalized media arena. While Canada tries to maintain its cultural differences, it also must balance this with responsibility in trade arrangements such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).|$|E
25|$|And this {{contradictory}} {{nature of}} media, is in turn {{due to the}} ways that media are mediated in modern-day culture: “In short, mass-mediated products are determined by various factors—the systems of ownership, the process of <b>cultural</b> <b>production,</b> the level of struggle, the state of consciousness in society at a given time, and so on. A dialectical method of analysis would involve studying all these factors within a concrete historical context so as to explain the multiple mediations that infuse a product of culture” (85). For many of these new thinkers, the very way that new forms of media are mediated by social actors, or way that these actors navigate the complex and contradictory forces of history, the material world, and culture through media {{is the key to}} the age old problem of mediation in Marxist theory.|$|E

25|$|Singapore {{was once}} the {{powerhouse}} of sophisticated Malay <b>cultural</b> <b>production,</b> until Kuala Lumpur took over in the 1970s. Although usually thought of as an essentially Chinese city, Singapore was nevertheless a Malay city. Contrary to the stereotype, Malays were the most urbanised of the island's three main races, {{and there was no}} such concentration of urbanised Malays anywhere else in the Malay world. Here were produced a high proportion of the modernist Malay writings, including novels and newspapers, that generated Malay nationalism. The emergence of Singapore-Malay community was added to by intermarriage with Arabs, Indian Muslims and Peninsula Malays immigrants, as well as the adoption of Chinese babies. In other words, Singapore's Malayness was a creolised culture, closer in character to the Pesisir (coastal) Malay culture that had developed elsewhere in the archipelago than to the kind of Malayness that characterised the Malay world proper of Peninsula and Sumatra. In Singapore itself, assimilation to Malayness was and is purely cultural, with no guiding hand to police it.|$|E
25|$|Despite Punjabi's rich {{literary}} history, it was {{not until}} 1947 that it would be recognized as an official language. Previous governments {{in the area of the}} Punjab had favoured Persian, Hindustani, or even earlier standardised versions of local registers as the language of the court or government. After the annexation of the Sikh Empire by the British East India Company following the Second Anglo-Sikh War in 1849, the British policy of establishing a uniform language for administration was expanded into the Punjab. The British Empire employed Hindi and Urdu in its administration of North-Central and North-West India, while in the North-East of India, Bengali was used as the language of administration. Despite its lack of official sanction, the Punjabi language continued to flourish as an instrument of <b>cultural</b> <b>production,</b> with rich literary traditions continuing until modern times. The Sikh religion, with its Gurmukhi script, played a special role in standardising and providing education in the language via Gudwaras, while writers of all religions continued to produce poetry, prose, and literature in the language.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{explores the}} role of Istanbul's ?<b>cultural</b> <b>productions?</b> as {{components}} of the city's structure and texture. Istanbul {{is a city of}} tensions, generated by its countless conflicting and divergent flows which are constantly influenced by socio-economic, political and cultural fusions and confusions. It is constantly expanding, both horizontally and vertically, as evidenced by its central and peripheral settlements, illegal dwellings and squatted lands. With each and every new inhabitant, further cumulative cultural input is added to the city, which also blends social exclusion and transgression (together with axiomatic de facto regulations). The city ?operates? as a jumbled mode of excessive information; the repetitive collapse and replenishment of this information overload opens up diverse ?realities?. Within this picture, ?<b>cultural</b> <b>productions?</b> of the city have emerged as indicators of inhabitants' reactions, exposing ways of coping with/surviving in the city. These <b>cultural</b> <b>productions</b> are locally, temporarily and spontaneously produced. Consequently, this essay investigates how such <b>cultural</b> <b>productions</b> have been processed by the inhabitants of the city since the 1980 s, and specifically focuses on the latest research and project models, navigating through projects undertaken by academics, artists and architects who correspond and have connections with international institutions ? most notably in the field of contemporary art...|$|R

Because of the impact of <b>cultural</b> <b>productions</b> upon conceptions of the world, the self, and the relationship between the two, this thesis will seek to develop an understanding of the way that black masculinity is depicted visually, and what the implications of this are for American culture...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{intends to}} {{research}} the association {{by the name of}} Retro and its <b>cultural</b> <b>productions</b> in order to identify social movement dimensions of Retro, and the impact it can have on society today. The concept of volunteerism will be unfolded focusing on the meaning it can add to the <b>cultural</b> <b>productions.</b> Research has been made claiming that early social movements is of great importance to democracy as we know it, and social movements today strive to challenge the dominating political culture. Furthermore, some claim that volunteerism is the very foundation on which we build our welfare society. According to several social scientists, (Flacks, 1988; Marcuse, 1969; Eyerman & Jamison, 1998; Crossley, 2002) social movements can bring about change in society through the cultural actions that take place in them, more than the political actions. Throughout the thesis I argue, that the social dimension and community of Retro which the <b>cultural</b> <b>productions</b> help create, is of big importance not only to the volunteer but also to the society in general. This provides attention to a desired social behaviour where individuals think about others than themselves – a quality that is crucial for the future existence of the welfare state...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} project {{comes out}} of an interest in labor and gender {{and the ways in}} which laboring bodies, specifically those of female domestic workers, are represented in <b>cultural</b> <b>productions.</b> One of the most popular means of portraying immigrant workers is through the employment of the hegemonic immigrant story, an anachronistic narrative that continues to be perpetuated both in <b>cultural</b> <b>productions</b> and in the general debate about immigration. The hegemonic immigrant narrative is based on a storyline of progress that redeploys the constructed binary between the country of origin and the host country. The introduction argues for a different way of reading immigrant narratives that deconstructs such a binary in order to situate the new immigrant narrative as occurring under a world-system, in which the movement of people across constructed national boundaries is no longer situated between spatially and temporally differentiated areas, but instead is seen as taking place within a global system [...] one based on various economic and political relationships. The <b>cultural</b> <b>productions</b> in the dissertation provide varying representations of immigration and domestic labor and include works of literature and film. The first chapter looks at the ways in which the hegemonic immigrant narrative has been employed by two canonical Chicano texts and two contemporary films in order to trace the perpetuation of the myth of upward mobility and assimilation. Chapter two provides an analysis of alternative narratives written by Latina writers that challenge the ideological containment of the traditional story of migration. The third chapter continues to focus on representations of domestic labor, but also includes the labor performed in the public sphere of the hotel industry. Ultimately, this dissertation is interested in looking at the ways in which <b>cultural</b> <b>productions</b> are using representations of labor and immigration to alter the narrative of immigration that continues to perpetuate ideas of success and assimilation. <b>Cultural</b> <b>productions</b> about marginalized immigrant communities whose immigrant experiences are not necessarily stories of progress serve to disarticulate the dominant immigrant narrative and ensure the visibility of immigrant patterns that have influenced the formation of the U. S. as a heterogeneous natio...|$|R
