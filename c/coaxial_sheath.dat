40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel <b>coaxial</b> <b>sheath</b> flow device where the sheath flow {{surrounds}} the sample flow at all sides. This micro fabricated device consists of a simple design and {{the dimensions of the}} channel have been chosen such that sample flow diameters of a few microns are feasible in a relatively large channel of 25 x 40 µm. This focusing technique prevents channel clogging and undesired sample adsorption on the channel walls. In this contribution we studied the sample flow profile using laser scanning confocal measurement method. The achieved sample flow dimensions of 1. 5 x 12 µm of the focusing section are verified with 3 D simulations...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNanoscale {{separation}} techniques, nanoscale packed capillary columns (75 μm id), and capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE), on-line with electrospray {{mass spectrometry}} (ESI/MS), {{were applied to}} the separation {{of a series of}} ten macrolide antibiotics. Both techniques use sub-microliter-per-minute flow rates through the analytical column and therefore require an electrospray probe that incorporates <b>coaxial</b> <b>sheath</b> flow. Positive ion electrospray mass spectra of these compounds yielded mainly protonated molecules. Fragmentation to yield structurally significant fragment ions was achieved by collision-induced dissociation (CID) at increased skimmer voltages. Separations were achieved using both techniques, with CZE/ESI/MS showing improved peak shapes and detection limits combined with faster analysis times. Nonescale packed capillary columns provided better chromatographic resolution and was less susceptible to peak broadening caused by overloading of the analytes...|$|E
40|$|Capillary Isoelectric Focusing (CIEF) is a {{high-resolution}} technique {{which can}} be applied to the separation and characterisation of complex biological mixtures such as dairy proteins. Although dairy proteins are commonly analysed by traditional gel electrophoresis techniques including 2 -Dimensional PAGE, CIEF offers the advantages of reduced analysis times, the ability to handle smaller sample volumes and increased sensitivity with improved separation efficiencies. Several methods for capillary isoelectric focusing of dairy proteins have been developed herein. For the analysis of soluble whey proteins methods that can be used with either UV or mass spectrometry (MS) detection have been set up. For MS detection a <b>coaxial</b> <b>sheath</b> flow interface in conjunction with electrospray ionisation has been utilised. For analysis of the inherently insoluble casein proteins with UV detection denaturing and reducing agents have been introduced into the system.

Examining penetration of magnetic flux into the superconductor core of the filament {{on the basis of}} the Bean model of the critical state, we find that the presence of a non-hysteretic magnetic sheath can strongly enhance the field of full penetration of magnetic flux. The average magnetization of the superconductor/magnet heterostructure under consideration and hysteresis AC losses in the core of the filament are calculated as well.

40|$|The Bean-Livingston barrier at the {{interface}} of type-II superconductor/soft-magnet heterostructures is studied {{on the basis}} of the classical London approach. This shows a characteristic dependence on the geometry of the particular structure and its interface as well as on the relative permeability of the involved magnetic constituent. The modification of the barrier by the presence of the magnet can be significant, as demonstrated for a cylindrical superconducting filament covered with a <b>coaxial</b> magnetic <b>sheath.</b> Using typical values of the relative permeability, the critical field of first penetration of magnetic flux is predicted to be strongly enhanced, whereas the variation of the average critical current density with the external field is strongly depressed, in accord with the observations of recent experiments.

40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{distribution}} pattern of specific antibody-containing cells in the spleen of rabbits during the secondary immune response, rabbits were given two intravenous injections of either free or liposome-associated human serum albumin (HSA) within an interval of 2 months. Demonstration of specific antibody-containing cells was performed by incubation of sections of spleen with HSA-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugates, followed by peroxidase cytochemistry. Specific anti-HSA antibody-containing cells were detected already within 2 days after booster and peak numbers were found 4 days after booster. The bulk of these cells localized in the <b>coaxial</b> lymphocyte <b>sheaths</b> surrounding the terminal arterioles in the spleen. Specific antibody-containing cells were {{also found in the}} follicles. Using a double immunoenzyme technique we demonstrated {{that a majority of the}} specific antibody-containing cells produced immunoglobulin G(IgG) antibodies. From the results, it is also concluded that, after a priming injection with liposome-associated HSA, liposomes do not further enhance the secondary immune response, when they are also used for the booster injectio...|$|R
40|$|Glycoalkaloids are {{naturally}} occurring nitrogen-containing compounds present in {{many species of}} the family Solanaceae, including cultivated and wild potatoes (Solanum spp.), tomatoes (Lycopersicon spp.), etc. These compounds have pharmacological and toxicological effects on humans due to their significant anticholinesterase activity and disruption of cell membranes. Herein is reported {{the development of a}} capillary electrophoresis (CE) method using nonaqueous (NA) separation solutions in combination with ion trap mass spectrometry (MS and MS/MS) detection for the identification and quantification of glycoalkaloids and their relative aglycones. A mixture 90 : 10 v/v of MeCN-MeOH containing 50 mM ammonium acetate and 1. 2 M acetic acid (applied voltage of 25. 5 kV) was selected as a good compromise for the separation and detection of these compounds.

40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{analysis}} of alkaloids in Coptis chinensis Franch was established by high performance capillary electrophoresis-electrospray ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (HPCE-ESI-TOF/MS). The real samples were separated by an uncoated capillary. 50 mmol/L ammonium acetate containing 0. 5 % methanol (pH= 7. 2) was used as the running buffer, and separation voltage was 25 kV. A <b>coaxial</b> <b>sheath</b> flow interface was used as the CE-MS interface, and a 50 % methanol- 49. 5 % water- 0. 5 % acetic acid mixture was used as the sheath liquid with a flow rate of 4 mu L/min. The lens voltages in a positive ion mode with a collision induced dissociation (CID) voltage of 100 V were used for ESI-TOF/MS analysis. Seven alkaloids in Coptis chinensis Franch methanol extracts were separated and identified by CE-DAD and CE-ESI-TOF/MS. The coupling of HPCE separation with accurate mass measurement capability of ESI-TOF/MS provides an attractive tool for the identification of alkaloid compounds in Coptis chinensis Franch...|$|E

Gas dynamic virtual nozzles produce the required micrometer-sized streams by the focusing action of a <b>coaxial</b> <b>sheath</b> gas and {{have been shown to be}} effective for SFXexperiments. Here, we describe the design and characterization of such nozzles assembled from ceramic micro-injection molded outer gas-focusing capillaries. Trends of the emitted jet diameter and jet length as a function of supplied liquid and gas flow rates are measured by a fast imagingsystem. The observed trends are explained by derived relationships considering choked gas flow and liquid flow conservation.

40|$|A {{capillary}} electrophoresis apparatus {{was used as}} sampler for flow injection analysis (FIA) in tandem mass spectrometry of l-carnitine and its acetyl- and propionyl-metabolites in human plasma. The {{capillary electrophoresis}} instrument was coupled to the ion trap mass spectrometer by an electrospray ionization <b>coaxial</b> <b>sheath</b> liquid interface. The electrophoresis capillary introduced the sample directly into the source by applying a prolonged sample injection. The use of the capillary electrophoresis apparatus miniaturised the FIA procedure, substantially reducing the quantities of solvents and samples used, and allowed rapid automated sequential analyses. The method was optimised and validated using a dialyzed human plasma matrix. The plasma samples were analysed after a simple, rapid deproteinisation procedure with acetonitrile and diluted 70 times before direct injection into the mass spectrometer for product ion scan MS/MS analysis in positive ionisation. The total analysis time was 5 min, including capillary preconditioning and acquisition time (3 min). The method was sensitive, allowing the determination of l-, l-acetyl- and l-propionyl-carnitines at 140, 14 and 3. 6 nM concentrations (injected values) corresponding to lower limit of quantitation values in plasma of 10, 1 and 0. 25 μM, respectively. The method was processed for full validation and applied {{to the analysis of}} l-carnitine and its short chain derivatives in human plasma samples...|$|E
40|$|Three standardised, {{capillary}} zone electrophoresis-electrospray ionisation {{mass spectrometry}} (CZE-ESI-MS) methods were {{developed for the}} analysis of six drug candidates and their respective process-related impurities comprising a total of 22 analytes with a range of functional groups and lipophilicities. The selected backround electrolyte conditions were found to be: 60 / 40 v/v 10 mM ammonium formate pH 3. 5 /organic, 60 / 40 v/v 10 mM ammonium acetate pH 7. 0 /organic and 10 mM piperidine, pH 10. 5, where the organic solvent is 50 / 50 v/v methanol/acetonitrile. The <b>coaxial</b> <b>sheath</b> flow consisted of either 0. 1 % v/v formic acid in 50 / 50 v/v methanol/water, or 10 mM ammonium acetate in 50 / 50 v/v methanol/water, depending on the mixture being analysed. Factor analysis and informational theory were used to quantify the orthogonality of the methods and predict their complementarities. The three selected CZE-ESI-MS methods allowed the identification of 21 out of 22 of all the drug candidates and their process-related impurities and provided orthogonality with four established high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) methods. These methodologies therefore form the basis of a generic approach to impurity profiling of pharmaceutical drug candidates and can be applied with little or no analytical method development, thereby offering significant resource and time savings...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a new analytical method, based on NACE online coupled with a mass spectrometer for the analysis of Peth in blood For this purpose an ion-trap mass spectrometer equipped with an orthogonal ESI source operating in negative ion mode was used An alkaline solution of ammonium acetate 5 mM (pH 9) in water/methanol (MeOH) (80 20 v/v) was delivered as <b>coaxial</b> <b>sheath</b> liquid All experiments were performed using an uncoated fused-silica capillary (90 cm x 75 mu m id) The effects of variable percentages of ACN, MeOH, 2 -propanol, dichloromethane, along with variable concentrations of ammonium acetate were investigated for the separation of Peth Collectively, a separation medium composed of ACN (45 % v/v), 2 -propanol (20 % v/v), dichloromethane (20 % v/v), MeOH (10 % v/v), water (5 % v/v), and ammonium acetate (25 mM) was chosen The estimated LOD was 0 1 mu M, while LOQ was 0 4 mu M. Within-run (ultra-day) and between-run (inter-day) precision was always lower than 15 % The method proved to be robust and reliable.

30|$|Currently, {{thoracic}} endovascular aortic repair is {{the first}} treatment of choice in patients with aneurysms of the descending thoracic aorta, depending {{on the condition of}} the patient, demographic factors, and suitable anatomy for stent-graft deployment. When there is an abnormal anatomical characteristic, such as severe aortic tortuosity, technical success may not be possible using ordinary maneuvers involving a stiff guidewire alone and delivery of stent grafts from femoral arteries in an antegrade direction. Furthermore, a catastrophic situation caused by thrombus or plaque embolization and rupture of calcifications can occur. In such anatomically challenging cases, it is important to carefully consider the choice of access route, the use of adjuvant guidewire technique, and the need for adjunctive surgical interventions. Several adjuvant techniques have been reported as means of overcoming these issues. The use of stiff “buddy” wires and the introduction of a <b>coaxial</b> <b>sheath</b> should be performed primarily to straighten an excessively tortuous aorta, but delivery of the stent graft can be difficult. The through-and-through wire technique, which pulls both sides of an externalized guidewire with adequate tension and straightens the severely tortuous aorta, is a powerful means of delivering stent grafts [2]. The through-and-through wire technique from the right brachial artery to the femoral artery was not feasible in the present case because the right brachiocephalic artery was severely tortuous [3]. The left common carotid artery and left subclavian artery did not allow the use of an externalized guidewire because of multiple severe calcifications around the supra-aortic vessels. Joseph et al. described a technique to create a transseptal externalized guidewire loop [4]. It was thought that this technique would result in acute deterioration of valve regurgitations caused by the indwelling guidewire. Furthermore, Saouti et al. described the efficacy of a transapical approach, which is often available in transcatheter aortic valve replacement [5]. This approach can lead to several complications such as respiratory failure by left thoracotomy, hemodynamic collapse due to aortic regurgitation, and ventricular pseudoaneurysm formation. Ultimately, we decided to perform antegrade TEVAR from the ascending aorta with a tube graft conduit.|$|E
40|$|Isoelectric {{focusing}} (IEF) is {{a powerful}} approach in separations of zwitterionic substances such as proteins, peptides and amino acids. It is important in proteomic research. Generally, in IEF, carrier ampholytes (CAs) are necessary to establish a stable pH gradient. However, CAs also bring attendant problems such as a decrease in detection sensitivity and suppression of ionization of analytes in mass spectrometry (MS) detection. It is desirable to build a pH gradient without using CAs. A simple slab based design was developed to establish a pH gradient using the electrolysis of water {{and the strength of}} free flow electrophoresis (FFE). The simple and robust CA free FFE-IEF design was applied in protein fractionation. In capillary format, capillary isoelectric focusing (CIEF), coupled to MS is a promising hyphenated technique for biomolecular analysis based on the combination of the high separation power of CE and the high specificity of MS. Coupling of the instruments is usually achieved with a <b>coaxial</b> <b>sheath</b> liquid interface, which decreases the detection sensitivity because of the dilution of sample by the sheath liquid. In this project, nano-electrospray, a sheathless interface, was used for coupling. Additionally, another major challenge is the presence of CAs which suppresses the ionization of analytes and contaminates the MS. In order to complete this project, a microcross union was chosen to couple CIEF with MS. A makeup solution was introduced to dilute the concentration of CAs after IEF to assist the ionization for MS detection. The makeup solution could replace the sheath liquid and could be maintained at a low flow rate so that nanoelectrospray could be performed. Monoliths can be described as integrated continuous porous separation media for micro scale separation columns. CAs were immobilized at different positions in the column according to their pIs, generating a monolithic immobilized pH gradient (M-IPG). In this project, carrier ampholytes was immobilized in poly (GMA-co-EDMA) based monolithic capillary and poly (GMA-co-acrylamide) based monolithic capillary to form a pH gradient. Two proteins were separated by IEF, which was implemented in poly (GMA-co-acrylamide) based monolithic capillary without CAs. The interface to MS was performed following the use of a microcross union as described previously. No typical noise of CAs was observed in the MS spectrum...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveRetrograde pedal access {{may allow}} the {{treatment}} of tibial occlusive lesions when standard endovascular techniques fail. We aimed to analyze the outcomes in patients with chronic limb ischemia (Rutherford class IV and V) who were not surgical candidates for a tibial bypass and had undergone an unsuccessful attempt at revascularization through an antegrade access. MethodsDuring a 3 -year period, a retrograde pedal access was selectively chosen when a popliteal or tibial lesion could not be crossed through an antegrade approach. Retrograde pedal access was performed under ultrasound guidance using a 4 F micropuncture <b>coaxial</b> <b>sheath.</b> All interventions were performed in a sheathless fashion using a 0. 014 - or 0. 018 -inch “bareback” wire as support for a 2 - or 2. 5 -mm balloon angioplasty catheter to cross and treat tibial chronic total occlusions {{that could not be}} treated through an antegrade approach. Routine anticoagulation and dual-antiplatelet therapy were used periprocedurally. Antegrade access was used to treat any lesion that required a stent placement after the retrograde wire was snared and brought through the antegrade guidecatheter. Patient indications and comorbidities were recorded. Outcomes analyzed were limb salvage rate, periprocedural complications, and mortality. Mean and standard deviations were calculated. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate limb salvage rates. ResultsA review of the 681 lower extremity angiograms in which a patient had an intervention from July 2010 through December 2013 identified 13 patients (nine men) in whom a retrograde pedal access was performed (mean age, 71. 4  ± 12. 4  years). Among these, diabetes was present in 10 of 13 (77 %) and chronic renal insufficiency (stages II-V) in nine (69 %). Five (38 %) had undergone contralateral amputation. Indications for a retrograde pedal revascularization were Rutherford chronic limb ischemia class IV in two (15 %) and class V in 11 (85 %). Technical success rate was 69 % (nine of 13). A variety of popliteal (two of 13) and tibial (13 of 13) vessels were treated with angioplasty alone (10 of 13) or angioplasty/stent placement (three of 13) through a retrograde approach. The technical failures were due to inability to cross the occlusion(s). Periprocedurally, there was one myocardial infarction but no local complications, worsening renal insufficiency, or deaths. At a mean follow-up of 17. 1  ± 10. 3  months, the limb salvage rate was 77 % (10 of 13). There was a high mortality rate of 23 % (three of 13) on follow-up in this cohort, occurring at median 6  ± 4  months. ConclusionsRetrograde pedal access for limb salvage in high-risk patients is feasible and safe, with acceptable limb salvage rates at intermediate follow-up. Appropriate candidates are those who have failed an antegrade intervention and are poor candidates for a tibial bypass. Future studies should test whether this mode of revascularization has favorable limb salvage rates in larger patient populations and seek to identify specific patient populations who will benefit from this technique...|$|E
40|$|Fast Capillary Electrophoresis–Mass Spectrometry. Measurements with {{capillary}} electrophoresis (CE) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) are desirable when both the high separation efficiency of {{capillary electrophoresis}} and the identification capabilities of mass spectrometry are required. With current instrumentation, analyses require between 10 min {{and more than}} one hour to complete. Fast CE–MS measurements are generally preferable; however, they become mandatory when a high sample throughput is required. Using an experimental setup of simple and straightforward design, a methodology to separate analytes with CE–MS both fast and efficiently has been developed, which successfully employs both aqueous and non-aqueous background electrolytes (BGEs). High electric field strengths of up to 1. 25 kV•cm− 1 and the use of short-length capillaries were found to be key in achieving fast separations. Hyphenation of CE and MS was accomplished using a <b>coaxial</b> <b>sheath</b> liquid electrospray ionisation interface. Its commercial availability and simple experimental design aid in the rapid implementation of fast CE–MS methodology by other researchers and laboratories. The influence of parameters inherent to this interface was studied in more detail as to its effects on both separation and detection, including suction pressure and dilution. It was shown that parameter settings different from those routinely recommended have to be used in order to achieve highly efficient separations. General conclusions could be drawn from these findings, which allow rapid method development for fast CE–MS. The influence of the capillary inner diameter (ID) on separations was investigated. In addition to standard capillaries of 75 and 50 µm ID, separations in capillaries with IDs of 25, 15, and 5 µm have been successfully applied to this setup. The analytical performance is compared over this range of capillary dimensions and both advantages and disadvantages are discussed. Usage of reduced ID capillaries allows for the analysis of sub-nL samples, the use of high conductivity BGEs, and can eliminate problems arising from certain parameter combinations in CE–MS experiments based on non-aqueous BGEs. Most significantly, it could be shown that reducing the separation capillary ID can have great potential in improving the separation efficiency. The often-cited assumption of increased dilution at the ESI interface (and, hence, decreased signal intensity) with decreased separation capillary ID was found to be far less dramatic. Together with the increase in separation efficiency and the correspondingly sharper analyte signals, this dilution effect either was not present at all, or was considerably lower than what would be expected from the volumetric ratio of separation capillary outflow to sheath liquid flow rate. The fast CE–MS methodology has been successfully applied to the separation of cationic and anionic analytes (co- and counter-electroosmotic separation conditions, respectively), namely catecholamines, hyaluronan oligomeres, organoarsenic compounds, and organotin compounds. For relevant sets of analytes, it could be shown that matrix-containing samples can be injected with only minimal sample pretreatment, with no negative effect on the CE–MS method. Most of these analytes could be separated in less than one minute; using a pressure-assisted approach, a separation within 10 s was possible. While the injection process employed here was manual, it could be easily automated. At the time of writing, work towards an automated setup for fast CE–MS is being conducted in the same working group. Small Samples. Efficient sample usage is of key importance in many bioanalytical questions for which a CE–MS separation is sought. The concept of injection efficiency is introduced to give a figure of merit to the injection process in analytical systems. It represents the ratio of injected sample and the amount of sample needed for carrying out the injection process (v/v). Typical values for the injection efficiency in CE range from 10 − 3 to 10 − 7. Based on the concept of capillary batch injection (CBI), the development of an automated system is presented. This device is capable of running true multi-sample measurement series, using minimal sample volumes in the lower nL range and delivering an injection efficiency of up to 100...|$|E
