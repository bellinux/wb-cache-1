5|$|RNA {{thermometers}} {{sensitive to}} temperatures of 37°C <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>by</b> pathogens to activate infection-specific genes. For example, the upregulation of prfA, encoding a key transcriptional regulator of virulence genes in Listeria monocytogenes, was demonstrated by fusing the 5' DNA of prfA {{to the green}} fluorescent protein gene; the gene fusion was then transcribed from the T7 promoter in E. coli, and fluorescence was observed at 37°C but not at 30°C.|$|E
5|$|The {{usage of}} ain't is a {{continuing}} subject of controversy in English. Ain't is commonly used by many speakers in oral and informal settings, especially in certain regions and dialects. Its usage is often highly stigmatized, and it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>by</b> the general public as a marker of low socio-economic or regional status or education level. Its use is generally considered non-standard by dictionaries and style guides except when used for rhetorical effect.|$|E

5|$|As with {{equipped}} items, Garment Grids {{often provide}} characters {{with a variety}} of enhancements and extra abilities. The game features diverse Garment Grids and dresspheres which can be discovered as the game progresses. While normal dresspheres <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>by</b> all three playable characters, each character can acquire a dressphere that only they can use. These dresspheres can only be activated after a character has changed into all of the classes designated to her Garment Grid in a single battle. When a character activates one of these dresspheres, the other characters are replaced by two controllable support units.|$|E
5|$|Guitar Hero Backstage Pass adds in {{role-playing}} {{video game}} elements {{to the core}} rhythm game; players not only play gigs as with Guitar Hero III Mobile but also must manage their band from near-poverty to stardom by creating marketing buzz about their band to virtual fans, manage their band, and plan out their performances at venues. Successfully completing these tasks helps the player to earn more money from their performances and to unlock new guitars and equipment that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>by</b> the band to further improve their performance.|$|E
5|$|Hyperpolarized xenon <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>by</b> surface chemists. Normally, it is {{difficult}} to characterize surfaces with NMR because signals from a surface are overwhelmed by signals from the atomic nuclei in the bulk of the sample, which are much more numerous than surface nuclei. However, nuclear spins on solid surfaces can be selectively polarized by transferring spin polarization to them from hyperpolarized xenon gas. This makes the surface signals strong enough to measure and distinguish from bulk signals.|$|E

5|$|Lithotrophic {{bacteria}} can use inorganic compounds {{as a source}} of energy. Common inorganic electron donors are hydrogen, carbon monoxide, ammonia (leading to nitrification), ferrous iron and other reduced metal ions, and several reduced sulfur compounds. In unusual circumstances, the gas methane <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>by</b> methanotrophic bacteria as both a source of electrons and a substrate for carbon anabolism. In both aerobic phototrophy and chemolithotrophy, oxygen is used as a terminal electron acceptor, whereas under anaerobic conditions inorganic compounds are used instead. Most lithotrophic organisms are autotrophic, whereas organotrophic organisms are heterotrophic.|$|E
5|$|The Internet is a {{worldwide}} network {{of computers and}} computer networks that {{communicate with each other}} using the Internet Protocol. Any computer on the Internet has a unique IP address that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>by</b> other computers to route information to it. Hence, any computer on the Internet can send a message to any other computer using its IP address. These messages carry with them the originating computer's IP address allowing for two-way communication. The Internet is thus an exchange of messages between computers.|$|E
5|$|The {{law also}} restricts {{the use of}} the emblem in other contexts—e.g. cities, towns or oblasts may not adopt a coat of arms or emblem using the {{national}} emblem either completely or in part. Furthermore, organizations not listed in the Law on State Symbols may only use the emblem by permission. The emblem <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>by</b> both foreigners and citizens of Belarus, as long as the symbol is displayed with respect, although citizens may not use the state emblem on letterheads or business cards if they are not agents of the government.|$|E

5|$|To ensure {{baseline}} compatibility {{between different}} HDMI sources and displays (as well as backward compatibility with the electrically compatible DVI standard) all HDMI devices must implement the sRGB color space at 8 bits per component. Ability {{to use the}} YCbCr color space and higher color depths ("deep color") is optional. HDMI permits sRGB 4:4:4 chroma subsampling (8–16 bits per component), xvYCC 4:4:4 chroma subsampling (8–16 bits per component), YCbCr 4:4:4 chroma subsampling (8–16 bits per component), or YCbCr 4:2:2 chroma subsampling (8–12 bits per component). The color spaces that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>by</b> HDMI are ITU-R BT.601, ITU-R BT.709-5 and IEC 61966-2-4.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-one cabins <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>by</b> {{visitors}} at Black Moshannon State Park. Thirteen are rustic cabins, {{built by the}} CCC, with electric lights, a kitchen stove and a wood-burning stove, refrigerator, and bunk beds. Six are modern cabins, including the former ski lodge, with electric heat, a bedroom, living room, kitchen, and bath. There are also two deluxe camping cottages with electric heat and similar amenities as the rustic cabins. All cabin renters need to bring their own household items such as linens and cookware. Pets are prohibited in all cabins in the park.|$|E
5|$|Western Australia {{banned the}} import of common {{starlings}} in 1895. New flocks arriving from the east are routinely shot, while the less cautious juveniles are trapped and netted. New methods are being developed, such as tagging one bird and tracking it back to establish where {{other members of the}} flock roost. Another technique is to analyse the DNA of Australian common starling populations to track where the migration from eastern to western Australia is occurring so that better preventive strategies <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used.</b> <b>By</b> 2009, only 300 common starlings were left in Western Australia, and the state committed a further A$400,000 in that year to continue the eradication programme.|$|E

5|$|According to the Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Rules, {{the use of}} {{the coat}} of arms is {{restricted}} to the government. Without explicit permission from the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts (MICA), no person or group is permitted to physically print, manufacture, display or sell anything depicting the coat of arms, or to allow such actions to happen. It is also forbidden to use any symbol that can be easily mistaken for the coat of arms. Persons who wish to use the coat of arms in a literary work must also obtain prior permission from MICA. The only exception provided by the Rules is that the arms <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>by</b> government officials and ministries on their building's exteriors and on printed documents.|$|E
5|$|Away {{fans are}} {{normally}} accommodated {{in the corner}} of the ground between the Broomloan and Govan Stands. For bigger games, such as the Old Firm derbies, the whole of the Broomloan Stand <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>by</b> the away support. Ibrox is seen as being an intimidating ground for visiting supporters. Rangers banned Celtic fans in 1994 from attending games at Ibrox, citing the damage caused to the Broomloan Stand by the visitors in previous derbies. The ban was lifted after one game, as the Scottish Football League passed a resolution preventing clubs from taking that action. Before the corners were filled in, away fans were accommodated in the lower tier of the Broomloan Stand. Rangers had to take action in 1996 to prevent their fans in the upper deck from throwing items at visitors.|$|E
5|$|Brought by JC's {{agents to}} Liberty Island, Alex learns that the island holds an old {{part of the}} pre-Collapse {{worldwide}} communication network which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>by</b> each faction. No matter what choices Alex has made up to now, they can choose to side with any faction, or kill all the leaders on Liberty Island. If Alex follows JC's plan, the biomods are distributed worldwide, giving Helios the ability to access all human thought, allowing it to govern humanity. If Alex sides with the Illuminati, they use the network to help create a global surveillance state where communication and the economy are controlled. If Alex joins the Templars, they help unite humanity under a theocracy where biomod use and those considered impure are ruthlessly suppressed. Killing all other factions on Liberty Island leads to global chaos, turning Earth into a wasteland dominated by the Omar.|$|E

5|$|Progestin-only pills, {{injections}} and intrauterine {{devices are}} {{not associated with}} an increased risk of blood clots and may be used by women with previous blood clots in their veins. In those with a history of arterial blood clots, non-hormonal birth control or a progestin-only method other than the injectable version should be used. Progestin-only pills may improve menstrual symptoms and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>by</b> breastfeeding women as they do not affect milk production. Irregular bleeding may occur with progestin-only methods, with some users reporting no periods. The progestins drospirenone and desogestrel minimize the androgenic side effects but increase the risks of blood clots and are thus not first line.

5|$|Several {{hundred years}} before {{the events of the}} game, a battle known as the War of Transgression took place between Pulse and Cocoon. During the battle, l'Cie from Pulse {{attacked}} and ripped a large hole in Cocoon. Eventually, the l'Cie completed their focus and were turned to crystal. The hole was patched with material lifted from Pulse, and Cocoon's citizens have since lived in fear of another invasion; this fear is used by the Sanctum to remain in power. The Sanctum oversees two military branches: the Guardian Corps, responsible for keeping order on Cocoon, and the Public Security and Intelligence COMmand (PSICOM), the special forces in charge of dealing with any threat related to Pulse. The fal'Cie have given the humans advanced technology, including flying airships and mechanical creatures, and a form of magic also exists. This magic is normally only accessible to l'Cie, fal'Cie, and various monsters in Cocoon and Pulse, though distilled chemical forms <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>by</b> normal humans through the use of Manadrives.|$|E
