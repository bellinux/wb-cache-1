5|$|Section Eight {{describes}} {{processes for}} enforcing and amending the Constitution. The <b>Constitution</b> <b>is</b> the supreme {{law of the}} land, therefore other laws and edicts cannot conflict with it. If a conflict occurs, the Constitution applies. If the <b>Constitution</b> <b>is</b> not in conflict, but a law and a decree is, the law would be enforced.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} the <b>constitution</b> <b>is</b> {{the result of the}} {{ordinary}} law of the land. In other words, it is not the source but the consequence of the citizens' rights.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that since Article 9(1) of the Singapore <b>Constitution</b> <b>is</b> pitched at a high level of generality, there is no limitation in the ordinary natural meaning of the phrase. Thus, there is no requirement in the Constitution for personal liberty to be construed narrowly to mean only freedom from physical restraint.|$|E
50|$|A <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> {{adopted in}} March 1992. The <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> semi-presidential. It {{is unclear how}} long the <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> even {{nominally}} operational. In April 1992 President Dudayev began to rule by decree and in June 1993 parliament was dissolved.|$|R
50|$|The Arkansas General Assembly is {{authorized}} by the Arkansas <b>Constitution,</b> which <b>is</b> the state's fifth <b>constitution.</b> The first <b>was</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> ratified on January 30, 1836, and the current <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> adopted in 1874. The <b>constitution</b> has also <b>been</b> amended throughout the state's history since 1874.|$|R

5|$|One of {{the members}} of the Presidential Elections Committee, which is the body {{empowered}} to ensure that candidates for the office of President have the qualifications required by the <b>Constitution,</b> <b>is</b> a member of the PCMR appointed to this post by the Chairman of the Council.|$|E
5|$|A key {{distinction}} between the bills of rights of the Commonwealth jurisdictions referred to above and the Singapore <b>Constitution</b> <b>is</b> that in the latter document, the grounds set out in Article 15(4) for restricting freedom of religion are not expressly subject to any requirement of reasonableness or necessity in a democratic society. One may query whether this is sufficient justification for a Singapore court to decline to apply a proportionality analysis to Article 15(4).|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts {{has a long}} {{political}} history; earlier {{political structures}} included the Mayflower Compact of 1620, the separate Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth colonies, and the combined colonial Province of Massachusetts. The Massachusetts Constitution was ratified in 1780 while the Revolutionary War was in progress, {{four years after the}} Articles of Confederation was drafted, and eight years before the present United States Constitution was ratified on June 21, 1788. Drafted by John Adams, the Massachusetts <b>Constitution</b> <b>is</b> currently the oldest functioning written constitution in continuous effect in the world. It has been amended 120 times, most recently in 2000.|$|E
50|$|On 30 March 2011, the <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> {{effectively}} voided {{as a new}} provisional <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> {{passed by}} the custodian military council in power. The new provisional <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> drafted to operate as a working constitution in the transitional period following the revolution, until a new one is drafted and approved.|$|R
5000|$|The 1997 <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> abrogated in September 2006 {{following}} a military coup. The military regime imposed an interim <b>constitution</b> which <b>was</b> in effect until the 2007 version was approved {{a year later}} by referendum. The 2007 <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> partially abrogated by the military regime that {{came to power in}} May 2014 and replaced by an interim constitution in effect until the new <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> approved in 2016.|$|R
50|$|On 4 July 1991, a new <b>Constitution</b> <b>was</b> promulgated. The changes {{generated}} by the new <b>constitution</b> <b>are</b> viewed as positive by Colombian society.|$|R
5|$|These {{decisions}} give {{support to}} a current mistaken {{view of the}} Constitution and the constitutional function of this court. This view, in short, is that every major social ill in this country can find its cure in some constitutional principle and that this court should {{take the lead in}} promoting reform when other branches of government fail to act. The <b>Constitution</b> <b>is</b> not a panacea for every blot upon the public welfare nor should this court, ordained as a judicial body, {{be thought of as a}} general haven of reform movements.|$|E
5|$|Constitutional {{questions}} {{may also be}} referred to the Tribunal when Parliament attempts to circumvent or curtail the discretionary powers conferred on the President by the Constitution. If the attempt is by way of an ordinary bill, the President can exercise personal discretion to withhold assent to it. It is then open to Cabinet to advise the President {{to refer to the}} Tribunal the question whether the bill in fact circumvents or curtails his discretionary powers. If the bill is determined by the Tribunal not to have that effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day following the day when the Tribunal's opinion is pronounced in open court. When Article 5A of the <b>Constitution</b> <b>is</b> brought into force, a similar procedure will apply to attempts to circumvent or curtail the President's discretionary powers through a constitutional amendment. If the Tribunal rules that the proposed amendment does have the effect of restricting the discretionary powers of the President, the Prime Minister is entitled to submit the bill to a national referendum for approval.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand is a {{constitutional}} monarchy with a parliamentary democracy, although its <b>constitution</b> <b>is</b> not codified. Elizabeth II is the Queen of New Zealand {{and the head}} of state. The Queen is represented by the Governor-General, whom she appoints on the advice of the Prime Minister. The Governor-General can exercise the Crown's prerogative powers, such as reviewing cases of injustice and making appointments of ministers, ambassadors and other key public officials, and in rare situations, the reserve powers (e.g. the power to dissolve Parliament or refuse the Royal Assent of a bill into law). The powers of the Queen and the Governor-General are limited by constitutional constraints and they cannot normally be exercised without the advice of ministers.|$|E
50|$|In September 2008, a new <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> {{accepted}} by the People's Council. Parliamentary elections under this new <b>constitution</b> <b>were</b> held on December 14, 2008.|$|R
5000|$|Because of the Syrian civil war, a {{referendum}} on a new <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> held on 26 February 2012. The <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> approved by the populace, and the article stating that Ba'ath Party was [...] "the leading party of society and state" [...] was removed and the <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> ratified on 27 February.|$|R
50|$|While the Lecompton <b>Constitution</b> <b>was</b> being debated, a new Free-State {{legislature}} {{was elected}} and seated in Kansas Territory. The new legislature convened a new convention, which framed the Leavenworth <b>Constitution.</b> This <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> the most radically progressive {{of the four}} proposed, outlawing slavery and providing a framework for women's rights. The <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> adopted by the convention at Leavenworth on April 3, 1858, and by the people at an election held May 18, 1858 (all while the Lecompton <b>Constitution</b> <b>was</b> still under consideration).|$|R
5|$|The History of the Roman <b>Constitution</b> <b>is</b> a {{study of}} Ancient Rome that traces the {{progression}} of Roman political development from {{the founding of the}} city of Rome in 753 BC to the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD. The constitution of the Roman Kingdom vested the sovereign power in the King of Rome. The king did have two rudimentary checks on his authority, which took the form of a board of elders (the Roman Senate) and a popular assembly (the Curiate Assembly). The arrangement was similar to the constitutional arrangements found in contemporary Greek city-states (such as Athens or Sparta). These Greek constitutional principles probably came to Rome through the Greek colonies of Magna Graecia in southern Italy. The Roman Kingdom was overthrown in 510 BC, according to legend, and in its place the Roman Republic was founded.|$|E
5|$|The President of Croatia and the Government {{cooperate}} {{in the formulation}} and implementation of Croatia's foreign policy. This provision of the <b>constitution</b> <b>is</b> an occasional source of conflict {{between the president and}} the government. The president decides on the establishment of diplomatic missions and consular offices of the Republic of Croatia abroad, at the Government's proposal and with the countersignature of the prime minister. The president, following prior countersignature of the prime minister, appoints and recalls diplomatic representatives of the Republic of Croatia, at the proposal of the Government and upon receiving the opinion of an applicable committee of the parliament. The president receives letters of credence and letters of recall from foreign diplomatic representatives.|$|E
5|$|The President of Croatia may {{dissolve}} Parliament {{upon the}} request of the government if the government proposes a confidence motion to Parliament and the majority of all deputies adopt a motion of no confidence or if Parliament fails to approve government budget 120 days after the budget is proposed in the parliament. That decision must be countersigned by the Prime Minister to become valid. The President may also dissolve Parliament after a motion of no confidence supported by a majority of all deputies has been adopted and a new government cannot be formed within 30 days or if a new government cannot be formed after general elections (maximum period of 120 days). However, the President may not dissolve Parliament at {{the request of}} the government if a procedure to determine if the President has violated provisions of the <b>constitution</b> <b>is</b> in progress.|$|E
50|$|The {{draft of}} <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> {{concluded}} by the Assembly. On 2 and 3 December 1979 the Iranian constitutional referendum was held and the <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> ratified.|$|R
50|$|It is {{commonly}} {{believed that the}} drafting of the <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> heavily influenced by Józef Piłsudski, who died {{two and a half}} weeks after the <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> passed.|$|R
25|$|Morsi {{reinstated}} parliament {{days after}} his election, and lawmakers set to work drafting a <b>constitution.</b> The <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> passed {{over the objections of}} opposition members who argued the process was faulty. When put to a referendum in December 2012, the <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> approved by a nearly 28-point margin, as supporters successfully argued that approval of the <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> needed to ensure stability.|$|R
5|$|When {{drafting}} the Belarus Constitution, the Supreme Soviet deputies {{were influenced by}} the constitutions of various countries, including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, and the United States. Internally, the Constitution {{was influenced by the}} period of Soviet domination and a desire to bring back traditions brushed aside by the Soviet Government. The structure of the <b>Constitution</b> <b>is</b> similar to the Russian Federation: for example, the office of the President has powers analogous to those granted to the President of Russia. Overall, the Constitution sought to preserve the statehood of Belarus from pro-Russian unity movements, provide a strong head of state that could cure the ailments Belarus would endure in the post-Soviet era, and lay out a compromise between the political factions in Belarus.|$|E
25|$|The <b>constitution</b> <b>is</b> {{divided into}} two sections.|$|E
25|$|A law {{to amend}} the <b>constitution</b> <b>is</b> a law for the {{purposes}} of Article 13.|$|E
25|$|By their nature, apostolic <b>constitutions</b> <b>are</b> {{addressed}} to the public. Generic constitutions use the title apostolic constitution, and treat on solemn matters of the church, such as the promulgation of laws or definitive teachings. The forms dogmatic constitution and pastoral <b>constitution</b> <b>are</b> titles sometimes used to be more descriptive as to the document's purpose. Apostolic <b>constitutions</b> <b>are</b> issued as papal bulls because of their solemn, public form.|$|R
50|$|The <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> {{signed on}} 7 April 2008 at 13:00 local {{time at the}} {{national}} library in Pristina. The <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> ratified on 9 April and came to effect on 15 June 2008.|$|R
2500|$|The 1967 <b>Constitution</b> <b>was</b> {{eventually}} {{replaced by}} a revised and updated Constitution which came into force on 1 June 1977, and the 1976 <b>Constitution</b> <b>was</b> amended at various points, including in 1994 pursuant to the Elections Act, 1994 to introduce [...] "at-large" [...] representatives into the legislature. [...] The 1976 <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> in turn superseded in 2007 by the current form which came into force on 15 June 2007.|$|R
25|$|Second, the Chinese <b>Constitution</b> <b>is</b> {{not treated}} {{as the supreme}} law, nor is it enforced.|$|E
25|$|In an originalist interpretation, if {{the meaning}} of the <b>Constitution</b> <b>is</b> static, then any ex post facto {{information}} (such as the opinions of the American people, American judges, or the judiciaries of any foreign country) is inherently valueless for interpretation of {{the meaning of}} the Constitution, and should not form any part of constitutional jurisprudence. The <b>Constitution</b> <b>is</b> thus fixed and has procedures defining how it can be changed.|$|E
25|$|Plebiscite is {{the electoral}} process by which an {{initiative}} on the <b>Constitution</b> <b>is</b> approved or rejected by the people.|$|E
50|$|Late in that year, the two <b>constitutions</b> <b>were</b> voted on, and the Freemen's <b>Constitution</b> <b>was</b> {{defeated}} in the legislature, largely by Dorr supporters, while the People's Convention version was overwhelmingly supported in a referendum in December. Much of the support for the People's Convention <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> from the newly eligible voters, but Dorr claimed {{that most of those}} eligible under the old constitution had also supported it, making it legal.|$|R
