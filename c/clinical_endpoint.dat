According to an article published 16 Sep 2015 in The Lancet, which reviewed the safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of VGX-3100 in a double-blind, randomized controlled trial (phase 2b) targeting HPV-16 and HPV-18 E6 and E7 proteins for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3, {{it is the first}} therapeutic vaccine to show efficacy against CIN 2/3 associated with HPV-16 and HPV-18. In June, 2017, VGX-3100 entered a phase 3 clinical trial called REVEAL-1 for the treatment of HPV-induced high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. The estimated completion time for collecting primary <b>clinical</b> <b>endpoint</b> data is August, 2019.|$|E

50|$|Surrogate {{endpoints}} {{and biological}} mediators are types of biomarkersâ€”objective indicators of normal or pathological physiological processes.

50|$|Research on {{the links}} between {{marriage}} and health has measured diverse outcomes. These are broadly categorized as <b>clinical</b> <b>endpoints,</b> surrogate endpoints, and biological mediators. <b>Clinical</b> <b>endpoints</b> are variables which affect how people feel, function, and survive.

40|$|Microarray-based {{prediction}} of <b>clinical</b> <b>endpoints</b> may be performed using either a one-color approach reflecting mRNA abundance in absolute intensity values or a two-color approach yielding ratios of fluorescent intensities. In this study, {{as part of}} the MAQC-II project, we systematically compared the classification performance resulting from one- and two-color gene-expression profiles of 478 neuroblastoma samples. In total, 196 classification models were applied to these measurements to predict four <b>clinical</b> <b>endpoints,</b> and classification performances were compared in terms of accuracy, area under the curve, Matthews correlation coefficient and root mean-squared error. Whereas prediction performance varied with distinct <b>clinical</b> <b>endpoints</b> and classification models, equivalent performance metrics were observed for one- and two-color measurements in both internal and external validation. Furthermore, overlap of selected signature genes correlated inversely with endpoint prediction difficulty. In summary, our data strongly substantiate that the choice of platform is not a primary factor for successful gene expression based-{{prediction of}} <b>clinical</b> <b>endpoints...</b>|$|R

40|$|Aims Diastolic tissue Doppler (TD) {{parameters}} allow {{prediction of}} patients with hypertrophic cardiomyo-pathy (HC) at risk of sudden death, ventricular tachycardia, or cardiac arrest. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the value of TD imaging in predicting the clinical course {{of patients with}} HC. Methods and results Eighty-six HC patients were prospectively included in the study and followed-up for <b>clinical</b> <b>endpoints</b> (cardiovascular death or hospitalization due to worsening of heart failure symp-toms). Patients with <b>clinical</b> <b>endpoints</b> (n 25) had larger left atrium diameters, thicker left ventricle (LV) walls, more often LV outflow obstruction and lower TD velocities of LV. LV outflow tract obstruction (r 0. 54, R 2 0. 29, P, 0. 03) and LV lateral mitral annular systolic tissue Doppler velocity (LMSa) (r 0. 50, R 2 0. 25, P, 0. 0001) were found to be independent predictors for <b>clinical</b> <b>endpoints</b> in forward stepwise regression. The best value of LMSa with the highest sensitivity (75 %) and specificity (88 %) was 4 cm/s for predicting <b>clinical</b> <b>endpoints.</b> Patients with LMSa velocities. 4 cm/s were significantly free of <b>clinical</b> <b>endpoints.</b> Conclusion In conclusion, LMSa seems to be a reliable parameter that can be used in predicting the HC patients at risk for clinical deterioration or death at long-term follow-up...|$|R
