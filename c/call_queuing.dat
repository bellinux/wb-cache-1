40|$|This paper {{explores the}} option of <b>queueing</b> <b>calls</b> in connection-oriented {{networks}} instead of blocking them when network resources are unavailable. A simple <b>call</b> <b>queueing</b> algorithm would be to hold up call setup messages at each switch along an end-to-end path until resources become available. This scheme suffers from poor network utilization and long <b>call</b> <b>queueing</b> delays. However, if calls have known holding times, {{it is possible to}} design call scheduling algorithms that result in reduced <b>call</b> <b>queueing</b> delays and improved network utilization. We propose algorithms for such call scheduling. We demonstrate the quantitative benefits of algorithms that exploit knowledge of call holding times. For example our simulations show that the maximum traffic load that can be handled in a network with the simple <b>call</b> <b>queueing</b> scheme is 70 % at which point the channel utilization is only 63 %, while with <b>call</b> <b>queueing</b> schemes that utilize knowledge of call holding times a maximum channel utilization of 87 % can be achieved. Also, <b>call</b> <b>queueing</b> delays with the latter are 85 % better than with the simple <b>call</b> <b>queueing</b> scheme at 70 % traffic load. Data transfers with known holding times are those that satisfy two properties: (i) the sending end of the data transfer is from a "stored" source rather than a "live" source, and (ii) the network supporting the data transfer uses a preventive congestion control scheme rather than a reactive scheme. Examples include large file transfers on circuit-switched networks and video-on-demand movie transfers on packet-switched connection-oriented networks with preventive congestion control, such as ATM variable bit rate service.

As customer goodwill is at stake, many companies have recognized the importance and value of hosted contact center solutions. These contact center solutions enable a company to retain critical assets – their contact center staff, and the associated centers in which they work – while enriching them with world class secure contact center tools such as automatic <b>call</b> <b>queuing,</b> workforce management, automated voice responses, quality monitoring and logging, through hosted technology.

Having a hosted contact center allows to focus on core business strengths and providing customers with an overall fantastic customer service experience without having to worry about the mechanics that enable providing that experience. Though the potential of the contact centers is rich in terms of its ability to serve the BPO business segment, it is not bereft of the security breaches and issues.

40|$|Threading by Appointment (TAP) is a {{concurrent}} programming model that combines automatic stack management (thread-based) with system <b>call</b> <b>queueing</b> (event-driven). However, unlike conventional threads, TAP threads invoke system calls by appointment only, and, unlike events, appointments have a duration, which {{is determined by}} the TAP runtime system transparently through a POSIX-compliant interface. The TAP mechanism essentially implements system <b>call</b> <b>queueing</b> using a given TAP policy that consists of a strategy to make appointments, i. e., enqueue system calls, and a logical clock to begin and end appointments, i. e., dequeue system calls. We propose a TAP policy that resembles traffic shaping in network routers, where system calls are treated as network packets. The policy distinguishes system calls for network and disk I/O, and gives priority to system calls invoked by short-running, interactive threads rather than long-running, bulk threads. We have implemented a high-performance, user-space TAP library and benchmarked the library using a multi-threaded, POSIX-compliant web server. ...|$|R
