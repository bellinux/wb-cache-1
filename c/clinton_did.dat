5|$|On March 1 ("Super Tuesday"), Clinton {{won seven}} of eleven contests, {{including}} {{a string of}} dominating victories across the South buoyed, as in South Carolina, by African-American voters and opened up a significant lead in pledged delegates over Sanders. She maintained this delegate lead across subsequent contests during the primary season, with a consistent pattern throughout being that Sanders did better among younger, whiter, more rural and more liberal voters and in states that held caucuses or where eligibility was open to independents, while <b>Clinton</b> <b>did</b> better among older and more diverse voter populations and in states that held primaries or where eligibility was restricted to registered Democrats.|$|E
5|$|The Clinton {{campaign}} had counted on winning the nomination by Super Tuesday and was unprepared financially and logistically for a prolonged effort; lagging in Internet fundraising as Clinton began loaning money to her campaign. There was continuous turmoil within the campaign staff {{and she made}} several top-level personnel changes. Obama won the next eleven February contests across the country, often by large margins and took a significant pledged delegate lead over Clinton. On March 4, Clinton broke the string of losses by winning in Ohio among other places, where her criticism of NAFTA, a major legacy of her husband's presidency, helped {{in a state where}} the trade agreement was unpopular. Throughout the campaign, Obama dominated caucuses, for which the Clinton campaign largely ignored preparation. Obama did well in primaries where African Americans or younger, college-educated, or more affluent voters were heavily represented; <b>Clinton</b> <b>did</b> well in primaries where Hispanics or older, non-college-educated, or working-class white voters predominated. Behind in delegates, Clinton's best hope of winning the nomination came in persuading uncommitted, party-appointed superdelegates.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clinton</b> <b>did</b> {{not mention}} DOMA in his 2004 autobiography. Over time, Clinton's public {{position}} on same-sex marriage shifted. He {{spoke out against}} the passage of California's Proposition 8 and recorded robocalls urging Californians to vote against it. In July 2009, he officially came out in support for same-sex marriage.|$|E

50|$|He was the Democrats' {{chief counsel}} (1995-1996) on the Senate Whitewater Committee which {{investigated}} {{a variety of}} allegations involving Bill and Hillary Clinton. He argued effectively that the <b>Clintons</b> <b>did</b> no wrong in connection with their investment in a failed land development project named Whitewater, or in their other Arkansas business affairs, nor did they commit violations of law after Mr. Clinton became president.|$|R
25|$|Johnson County is {{at present}} and {{historically}} a powerfully Republican county. No Democrat has ever won {{a majority of}} the county's vote since at least 1880, though Bill <b>Clinton</b> <b>did</b> gain narrow pluralities in 1992 and 1996, and Lyndon Johnson lost to Barry Goldwater by a mere twenty-two votes in 1964.|$|E
25|$|Following the calamitous {{operations}} at Newport and Savannah, French planners realized closer {{cooperation with the}} Americans was required to achieve success. The French fleet, led by the Comte de Grasse, had received discretionary orders from Paris to assist joint efforts in the north if naval support was needed. Washington and his French counterpart, the Comte de Rochambeau, discussed their options. Washington pushed for an attack on New York, while Rochambeau preferred a strike in Virginia, where the British were less well-established and thus, easier to defeat. Franco-American movements around New York caused Clinton {{a great deal of}} anxiety, fearing an attack on the city. His instructions to Cornwallis during this time were vague, rarely forming explicit orders. However, <b>Clinton</b> <b>did</b> instruct Cornwallis to establish a fortified naval base, and transfer troops to the north to defend New York. Cornwallis dug in at Yorktown, and awaited the Royal Navy.|$|E
25|$|The {{popular vote}} tally from most news {{organizations}} {{did not include}} Iowa, Maine, Nevada, and Washington. These states did not release {{the results of the}} popular vote from their caucus'. The media reports did include Florida, which neither Clinton nor Obama contested, and Michigan. Both states were penalized by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) for violating party rules. Michigan proved a source of controversy due to the change in the date of the primary election. Consequently, Obama and other nominees removed their names from the ballot yet <b>Clinton</b> <b>did</b> not. The DNC did not count the popular vote from Michigan, and evenly split the states delegates between Clinton and Obama. As a result, without the Michigan vote, Obama won the popular vote; whereas with the votes from Michigan, Clinton won the popular vote. Nevertheless, regardless of how votes were counted, the candidates' totals were within {{less than one percent of}} each other.|$|E

25|$|Obama's {{developing}} presidential {{agenda was}} divided into {{domestic and foreign policy}} issues. In most cases, this agenda involved addressing crises already underway. His principal strategic decisions concerned how quickly to move bills through Congress. Some of his advisors suggested moving quickly, as Franklin D. Roosevelt did in 1933, under the belief that a more moderate approach would waste valuable time early in his presidency, when his political capital will be strongest. Others suggested moving more slowly, as Bill <b>Clinton</b> <b>did</b> before his attempt to enact a national healthcare program, based on the notion that rapid change could quickly wear down any bipartisan consensus. He was expected, in any case, to issue a series of executive orders within days of his inauguration, including a reversal of Bush-era executive orders restricting funding to family planning (including abortion) services and stem-cell research. There was also a possibility that a new cabinet level advisory post would be created overseeing the Department of Energy, Department of the Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency.|$|E
25|$|Barack Obama {{scored a}} major victory in the Iowa Democratic Caucuses due {{to a number of}} factors. According to exit polls, 93 percent of voters in the Iowa Democratic Caucus were Caucasian and 33 percent voted for Obama, 27 percent for Clinton, and 24 percent for Edwards; 4 percent of voters were African American and 72 percent voted for Obama, 16 percent for Clinton, and 8 percent for Edwards; 3 percent {{represented}} other races and they went 49 percent for Obama, 26 percent for Clinton, 10 percent for Richardson, and 5 percent for Edwards. Obama also won young voters ages 17–44 with 52 percent of the vote compared to 16 percent for both Clinton and Edwards. Edwards won middle-age voters ages 45–59 with 30 percent while Obama received 29 percent and Clinton took in 26 percent of their support. <b>Clinton</b> <b>did</b> best among elderly voters ages 60 and over with 40 percent of the vote while Edwards received 27 percent and Obama took in 19.5 percent of their support. Obama won self-identified Democrats by a margin of 32-31-23 (Obama-Clinton-Edwards), Independents backed Obama 41-23-17 (Obama-Edwards-Clinton), as well as self-identified Republicans who supported Obama 44-32-10 (Obama-Edwards-Clinton). Obama also won moderates and liberals but Edwards won conservatives. Socioeconomic class was not really a factor in how voters made their decisions, as Obama won all groups of family incomes.|$|E

The structural engineer for this project was Leslie E. Robertson Associates. The museum and exhibitions were designed by Ralph Appelbaum Associates, with landscaping by Hargreaves associates. <b>Clinton</b> <b>did</b> not announce his choice of architect until 1999, when Polshek was officially hired that August.

40|$|The Democratic and GOP {{conventions}} were {{an illustration}} of the “Two Americas” that John Edwards spoke of in 2004, writes Walter Dean Burnham. While the GOP’s convention had a hateful atmosphere, and displayed a party closing in on itself, the Democrats by contrast, focused on the ‘Politics of Joy’. Even if Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>does</b> take the White House, however, he warns that she could still be facing a GOP-held Senate and House next January, which would continue the political gridlock that President Obama has faced {{for the past two}} years...|$|R

Before contacting authorities, one reveals that his card reads, [...] "YOU are a HIT-AND-RUN KILLER." [...] This begins a macabre game of musical chairs of sorts, with guests jousting over who lays claim to which dirty little secret. Paranoia grows over the obvious implication that both Sheila and Clinton were killed by somebody on this yacht.|$|R
500|$|Upon {{graduating from}} Georgetown in 1968, Clinton won a Rhodes Scholarship to University College in Oxford, England, where he {{initially}} read for a B.Phil. in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics but {{transferred to a}} B.Litt. in politics and, ultimately, a B.Phil. in politics. <b>Clinton</b> <b>did</b> not expect the second {{year because of the}} draft and he switched programs; this type of activity was common among other Rhodes Scholars from his cohort.

They {{captured}} Richmond by surprise {{and then went}} on a rampage through Virginia, destroying supply houses, foundries, and mills. [...] This activity brought out Virginia's militia, led by Colonel Sampson Mathews, initiating Arnold's return to Portsmouth to hold the port there.

[...] Reinforcements arrived in March, led by William Phillips who had served under Burgoyne at Saratoga, and he took over the command. [...] However, <b>Clinton</b> <b>did</b> not issue orders recalling Arnold, so he accompanied Phillips on new raiding expeditions into the Virginia countryside. [...] The force advanced on Petersburg, where they defeated a militia force led by Baron von Steuben at the Battle of Blandford in late April. [...] The arrival at Richmond of the Marquis de Lafayette and 900 Continental troops sent by General Washington to oppose Arnold prompted Phillips to begin making his way back to Portsmouth. [...] While en route, they were ordered to return to Petersburg by Charles Cornwallis, the commander of the British southern army, where he would join them with his force. [...] Phillips fell ill on the way and died of a fever at Petersburg on May 12.|$|E

It's reasonable enough to argue that Mr. Bush could have done more to guard against terror, though it isn't clear what.
