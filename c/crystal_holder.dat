50|$|A {{combination}} of turbomolecular and cryo pumps {{are used in}} standard UHV growth chambers. The chamber itself {{is equipped with a}} liquid nitrogen cryoshield and a rotatable <b>crystal</b> <b>holder</b> capable of carrying more than one wafer. The <b>crystal</b> <b>holder</b> is usually heated from the backside to temperatures of 500 to 700°C. Most setups also have RHEED equipment for the in-situ monitoring of surface superstructures on the growing surface and for measuring growth rates, and mass spectrometers for the analysis of the molecular species in the beams and the analysis of the residual gases.The gas inlet system, {{which is one of the}} most important components of the system, controls the material beam flux. Pressure controlled systems are used most commonly. The material flux is controlled by the input pressure of the gas injection capillary. The pressure inside the chamber can be measured and controlled by a capacitance manometer. The molecular beams of gaseous source materials injectors or effusion jets that ensure a homogeneous beam profile. For some starting compounds, such as the hydrides that are the group V starting material, the hydrides have to be precracked into the injector. This is usually done by thermally decomposing with a heated metal or filament.|$|E
40|$|We {{present results}} from our Ho:YLF {{regenerative}} amplifier (RA) producing up to 6. 9 mJ at a repetition rate of 1 kHz {{and up to}} 12. 9 mJ at a repetition rate of 10 Hz. At 1 kHz, we observe strongly bifurcating pulses, starting with a certain round trip number, but the measurements identify a highly stable operation point that lies “hidden” beyond the instability region. This operation point allows the extraction of highly stable and high energetic output pulses. Suppression of bifurcation in our system is presented for repetition rates below 750 Hz and Ho:YLF <b>crystal</b> <b>holder</b> temperatures of 2. 5 °C. We furthermore present a stability optimization routine for our Ho:YLF RA that was operated close to gain depletion at a repetition rate of 100 Hz.

40|$|A key {{challenge}} to researchers in optics and photonics {{is the lack}} of suitable broadband lasing materials for the ultraviolet (UV) domain. Hence, the use of nonlinear optics for generation of harmonics for the UV domain, from either infrared (IR) or visible (Vis) lasers. In this work, we made use of nonlinear optical conversion to develop a compact 355 nm pulsed UV laser from a passive Q-switched pulsed infrared laser (1, 064 nm). Two nonlinear crystals, barium borate (BBO) and potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP), are, in turn, used to generate the third harmonic of the IR laser by frequency mixing, after initial frequency doubling through a potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) crystal. We make the laser user friendly by constructing <b>crystal</b> <b>holders</b> for the nonlinear crystals so that it becomes easier to angle tune the crystals for optimum generation of the third harmonic. The UV laser is stable and has output pulse energy up to 148 and 110 mJ, with conversion ratio from IR to UV of about 0. 29 and 0. 21 for BBO and KDP, respectively...|$|R

A microchannel plate-based low energy electron diffraction/retarding field Auger electron spectrometer (AES) apparatus identifies surface structures present on the outer surface of the cylinder, while a separate double pass cylindrical mirror analyzer AES verifies surface cleanliness. A supersonic molecular beam, skimmed by a rectangular slot, impinges molecules on a narrow longitudinal strip of the surface.

The observation of this decay would provide critical insight into our understanding of neutrinos, yielding definitive evidence that neutrinos are Majorana particles and providing information on the absolute mass of neutrinos. Achieving sensitivities to 0 {nu}{beta}{beta} decay half-lives {{on the order of}} 10 {sup 26 } years requires ultra-low backgrounds in the 2039 keV region where a 0 {nu}{beta}{beta} decay peak would be observed.

Suitable crystals were produced at the Sensor Semiconductor Laboratory of Ferrara starting from Silicon On Insulator wafers, adopting proper revisitation of silicon micromachining techniques such as Low Pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition, photolithography and anisotropic chemical etching. Mechanical holders, which allow to properly bend the crystal and to reduce unwanted torsions, were employed. Crystallographic directions and <b>crystal</b> <b>holder</b> design were optimized in order to excite quasi-mosaic effect along (1 1 1) planes. Prior to exposing the crystal to particle beams, a full set of characterizations were performed. Infrared interferometry was used to measure crystal thickness with high accuracy.

40|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} is {{the method}} of choice to deduce atomic resolution structural information from macromole-cules. In recent years, significant investments in structural genomics initiatives have been undertaken to automate all steps in X-ray crystallography from protein expression to structure solution. Robotic systems are widely used to prepare crystallization screens and change samples on synchrotron beamlines for macromolecular crystallography. The only remaining manual handling step is {{the transfer of the}} crystal from the mother liquor onto the <b>crystal</b> <b>holder.</b> Manual mounting is relatively straightforward for crystals with dimensions of> 25 mm; however, this step is nontrivial for smaller crystals. The mounting of microcrystals is becoming increasingly important as advances in microfocus synchrotron beamlines now allow data collection from crystals with dimensions of only a few micrometres. To make optimal usage of these beamlines, new approaches have to be taken to facilitate and automate this last manual handling step. Optical tweezers, which are routinely used for the manipulation of micrometre-sized objects, have successfully been applied to sort and mount macromolecular crystals on newly designed crystal holders.

The improved components are (1) the <b>crystal</b> <b>holder</b> whose aperture and resolving power have been nearly doubled and (2) the collimator the new model of which can now discriminate between the reflected and transmitted beams when these differ in direction by only 8 minutes of arc, a threefold improvement over our first model.

40|$|This thesis covers {{some of the}} {{development}} of a novel vapour growth system for the production of large, high quality crystals of cadmium telluride, focusing in particular on ampoule development, flow calibration, and mass transport studies. The Multi Tube Physical Vapour Transport system is an evolution of the Markov design, the unique feature being a U-Tube ampoule configuration which allows direct viewing of the crystal surface, and in-situ, non invasive vapour pressure monitoring. The system incorporates a capillary flow restrictor between source material and the growing crystal which allows the mass transport rate to be controlled almost independently of crystal temperature. The growth tube section of the ampoule has been modified to allow hardened platinum wires of well defined diameter to be inserted between the <b>crystal</b> <b>holder</b> (a conical plug with polished upper surface which fits into a ground glass socket in the growth tube) and ampoule wall, allowing the aimulus gap to be defined by the thickness of the wire. A shielding system for the vapour pressure monitoring system has been developed and tested which prevents cadmium or cadmium telluride (which has escaped from the growth ampoule via non perfect ground glass joints) from condensing on the sapphire windows of the outer vacuum jacket. The capillary flow restrictor has been calibrated for viscous, molecular and mixed flow regimes using several test gasses. This information has been used to model the mass transport of CdTe in 3 growth runs of the MTPVT system by integrating viscous and molecular flow rates with respect to time. The mass of CdTe transported from source to crystal during each run selected for study was in good agreement with the mass transport of CdTe predicted by the flow model...|$|E
40|$|Description {{is given}} of a transmission‐type, curved‐crystal {{focusing}} spectrometer for short wave‐length x‐rays, and gamma‐rays having a dispersion of 1. 186 x. u. per mm at short wave‐lengths. The spectrometer utilizes the (310) planes of quartz in a crystalline plate of dimensions 80 × 70 × 1. 0 mm curved cylindrically to a radius of two meters. High luminosity is obtained since the useful aperture in the <b>crystal</b> <b>holder</b> has {{an area of}} 10 cm 2 and subtends 0. 00025 stereradians at the focus. It also affords high resolution since by photographic tests with x‐rays the curved plate {{has been shown to}} focus a specified x‐ray wave‐length to within 0. 06 mm of the same position on the focal circle for all parts of its useful aperture and over the entire operating wave‐length range. The geometry of the mechanism permits absolute measurements with a precision screw of the sine of the Bragg angle {{on both sides of the}} reflecting planes, affording a wave‐length range which includes at longest wave‐lengths the K‐spectrum of silver and goes down to zero wave‐lengths. For short wave‐length gamma‐rays the source is placed at the focus. A multiple‐slit collimator of tapering die‐cast lead partitions spaced apart with tapering separators, is used at short wave‐lengths to transmit the monochromatic diffracted beam and absorb the directly transmitted and scattered heterogeneous beam. The present collimator limits the spectrum that can be studied to a shortest wave‐length of 7. x. u. corresponding to 1. 75 Mev. The intensity of the diffracted beam is to be measured with a special multi‐cellular G. M. counting tube of high efficiency, provided with a number of thin lead partitions through which the beam passes successively. In photographic spectra made with this instrument the tungsten and also the silverKβ_ 1 β_ 3 doublet is completely and clearly resolved.
