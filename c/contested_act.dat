40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the {{effectiveness}} of administrative courts judgments considered in terms of their impact over time for selected forms of action and inaction (inactivity) of tax authorities relating to the implementation of tax liability on the basis of Tax Law. Furthermore, this paper analyzed the impact of such judgments in time for the parties to respect the legal situation for tax purposes. In the simplest terms, the impact of judgment at the time means to have an effect on the legal consequences in respect of the <b>contested</b> <b>act,</b> interpretation or action back (retroactive – ex tunc) or from the time of its announcement (ex nunc). By influencing the action or inaction (inactivity) of tax administration the judgment of administrative court has also impact on the legal situation (procedural and substantive) for both the authority as well as the recipient of that authority. The effectiveness of the impact at the time of the judgments of provincial administrative courts depends largely on whether the court upheld the complaint or dismiss it. In case of taking into account the effectiveness depends on the type of penalties leading to the overthrow of the <b>contested</b> <b>act,</b> interpretation or actions, provided for in the Law on proceedings before administrative courts. We should also take into account and distinguish the impact point on appeal challenged action or inaction (inactivity) of the tax authorities from the impact – in a certain sense indirect – on the tax law situation (procedural and substantive) of the entity. p. pietrasz@uwb. edu. plUniwersytet w Białymstoku, Wydział Praw...|$|E
40|$|In {{the case}} C- 658 / 11 European Parliament v Council the CJEU {{was asked to}} assess the {{legitimacy}} of Council Decision 2011 / 640 /CFSP on {{the conclusion of the}} agreement between the EU and Mauritius for the transfer and trial of suspected pirates arrested in the framework of Operation Atalanta. More specifically, whilst the EP agreed with the Council that the said agreement had to be concluded on the basis of Article 37 TEU, it nonetheless sustained that the agreement could not be concluded on the basis of Article 37 TEU alone since the agreement is not exclusively linked to the CFSP but is also linked to other policies of the EU that are based on the TFEU. Moreover, the EP also attached the decision of the Council because the latter institution failed to keep informed the EP at all stages of the procedure leading to the conclusion of the agreement. With its judgement of the 24 June 2014, the CJEU rejected the thesis of the EP. By making reference to its ‘centre of gravity’ test the CJEU decided to focus on the context of Operation Atalanta in which the agreement was concluded and held such link sufficient to exclude the necessity to make recourse to other, incidental, aims of an agreement to integrate the choice of the correct legal basis. On the other hand, the CJEU found that the Council had violated the right of the EP to be kept informed, at all stages, about the negotiations and conclusion of agreements and annulled the <b>contested</b> <b>act.</b> With this judgement the CJEU has contributed in making clear that the respect of procedural requirements between the Council and the EP is important even when the role of the EP is merely passive. At the same time, whilst the case brought by the EP could have been used to clarify the relationship between external action under the CFEP and other instruments of external relations based on the TFEU, the CJEU missed on this opportunity and solved the case formalistically...|$|E

40|$|In {{the natural}} {{resource}} literature, convertional wisdom holds that weak property rights {{will cause a}} resource to be over-exploited. This is because weak property rights are typically perceived as a problem of input exclusion. In this paper, we first present evidence {{to the effect that}} weak property rights often take the form of contestable output- or output theft - and that this has an impact or resource use. We then propose a theoretical model of natural resource use under generally weak prperty rights - or weak state presence - when resource users face the dual problem of input exclusion output appropriation. We show that introducing the possibility that outputs can be <b>contested</b> <b>acts</b> as an output tax, with the added twist that resource users effectively determine the level of the tax. This tax has a depressive effect on input use.

It will thus be pointed out that the Union liability is supposed to be incurred not only for illegal acts of its institutions, but also for their valid legal acts. It will be emphasised that the issue of Union liability for its Courts’ decisions has also been stressed in the case-law.

25|$|Few, {{even in the}} Labour Party, gave Robinson {{much chance}} of winning the presidency, not least because of an {{internal}} party row over her nomination. With the Labour Party the first name for a possible candidate was an elderly former minister for Health, and hero to the left, Noel Browne. Browne was a household name for having done {{more than anybody else}} in Ireland for tackling Tuberculosis in the 1950s. However Browne's relationship with the Labour Party had been stormy. He was critical of its ties with Fine Gael and had co-founded the short lived Socialist Labour Party in 1977 after leaving the Labour Party. Although he was supported by left wing members within Labour such as Michael D. Higgins, he had little or no contact with Dick Spring and therefore had to live in hope of being nominated without the endorsement of the party leadership. The possibility that Browne might be nominated raised the possibility of an internal argument within the party. The fact that Browne was enthusiastic for candidacy, in a contest where Labour never before <b>contested,</b> now <b>acted</b> as pressure for Labour to find a candidate. Spring did not feel that he could control Browne {{for the duration of the}} election, given Browne's history of defying party policy to such a degree that Browne had to leave several political parties. In these circumstances the decision to propose Robinson proved to be politically inspired. Robinson had an advantage in being the first candidate nominated for the election (and the first female), in that she could cover more meetings, public addresses and interviews. However she refused to be drawn on specifics in case she would alienate possible support. Robinson also received the backing of the Irish Times newspaper, and this proved hugely advantageous.|$|R
5000|$|The {{sovereignty}} of the United States and Native tribes plays a significant thematic role in the play. Many of the survivors discuss the negative effects that Oliphant v.

The case held that, [...] "Indian tribal courts do not have inherent criminal jurisdiction to try and to punish non-Indians, and hence may not assume such jurisdiction unless specifically authorized {{to do so by}} Congress," [...] thus effectively increasing crime rates of non-Indians on reservations. Even with the passing of VAWA, the {{sovereignty of}} tribes as [...] "domestic dependent nations" [...] is still <b>contested,</b> as the <b>act</b> established a framework to prosecute sex offenders through the US court system instead of tribal courts, even if the crime occurs on tribal land. The US has much stronger negotiating power, and many opponents of tribal sovereignty assert that for the US to cede any more authority to tribes than the little they already have would be detrimental to the overall {{sovereignty of the}} United States. The resistance of these opponents is a daunting obstacle for any attempt to legitimize the authority of tribal law.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} contemporary place of Islam in urban life through a mixed-methods project based in Istanbul, Turkey. In {{cities around the}} world, the form and practice of Islam is being reshaped by new kinds of political governance, economic development, and cultural consumption. At the same time, debates about religious authority, social integration, and communal identity often revolve around questions of how people move through, transform, and inhabit {{the public and private}} spaces of the city as Muslims. Istanbul is a city in which those questions and debates have particular relevance. On the one hand, Islam is an unmistakable part of the city’s landscape. Istanbul’s mosques and minarets articulate a Muslim urban identity rooted in the very stones of the city. On the other hand, everyday practices of being Muslim in Istanbul today are also inextricable from a rapidly changing set of political, social, and economic transformations. These two dimensions –an Islam rooted in the city and an Islam woven through local, national, and transnational networks – come together in the Istanbul district of Ey?p, long known as one of Istanbul’s most important Muslim shrines. In this dissertation, I argue that Ey?p’s built environment functions as the key medium of connection through which both residents and visitors link themselves to the world around them, an act at the heart of making a place for Islam in the city. I show that the form of the built environment and the meanings it carries are not rooted and unchanging but the outcome of debates and contests between unequally positioned individuals and groups. Drawing on both archival and ethnographic methods, I show how, why, and with what consequences Ey?p’s built environment has mediated different connections {{over the course of the}} 20 th century. In Chapter One, I explore three different buildings in Ey?p that connected Islam to the modern in different ways: the construction of a new Halkevi (People’s House), the restoration of the Zal Mahmut Paşa Mosque, and the expansion of Ey?p’s road network. By placing Ey?p’s religious landscape in a particular relationship to the modern city, these projects helped create a new image of urban Islam. Chapter Two turns to the 1990 s, a period in which Ey?p’s landscape was configured not as modern but as Ottoman. Excavating the cultural politics of the local municipality and the constellation of institutions, laws, and agendas that made Ey?p’s redevelopment possible, I argue that making Ey?p Ottoman involved the articulation of new connections between past and present even as other connections between residents and the district’s working-class landscapes were erased. Chapter Three focuses on the geography of observance that characterizes Ramadan in Ey?p. Avoiding simple mappings of religious versus secular space, I argue that this geography of Ramadan is best understood in terms of the overlapping connections that link private and public space, internal piety with external observance, and this one district with the world around. In Chapter Four, I examine the normative rules of place that govern how the Mosque of Ey?p Sultan should be used, moved through, and experienced. Rather than be rooted in place, I find that these rules are in fact the product of interconnections between people, places, and narratives. Focusing on three groups typically seen as out of place in the mosque – foreign visitors, tourists, and women – I argue that the greatest tensions are located not in the difference between Muslims and non-Muslims but in the different forms of being Muslim in this mosque. My archival and ethnographic study of the Istanbul district of Ey?p shows how Islam’s place in the city is made through <b>contested</b> <b>acts</b> of connection. Although these connections take multiple forms and make use of diverse materials, the built environment functions as the key medium through which people articulate meaningful connections with the world around them. This dissertation brings together scholarship in cultural geography, cultural anthropology, urban studies, and Middle East area studies to provide a rich account of how Islam is lived, experienced, and articulated in relation to the changing city of Istanbul...|$|R
