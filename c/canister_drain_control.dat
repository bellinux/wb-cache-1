A standard preoperative anti-coagulation regimen was utilized on all patients with enoxaparin sodium 40  mg (Lovenox, Sanofi-aventis, Bridgewater, NJ, USA) injected subcutaneously once per day. The enoxaparin sodium was withheld 24  h prior to surgery. A standard K-L surgical approach, without extension or trochanteric osteotomy, was used in all cases. All surgical procedures were performed by fellowship trained orthopedic traumatologists specializing in acetabular and pelvic fracture surgery. As per hospital protocol, all study patients received preoperative antibiotics. A standard perioperative prophylactic antibiotic protocol utilizing a weight-based dose of cefazolin was administered; alternatively vancomycin was administered to patients with a drug allergy to cefazolin. Intraoperatively all patients received identical deep closure of the fascia using (0) vicryl (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA) interrupted sutures and 2 – 0 monocryl interrupted subdermal sutures. Two suction canister 1 / 8 inch drains were placed: sub-fascial (deep) and extra-fascial (superficial). A standard occlusive gauze dressing was applied to all wounds. Antibiotics were continued until the suction <b>canister</b> <b>drains</b> were removed.

The tolerance of grain legumes to waterlogging may vary between and within species. This study investigated the effects of 7 days of waterlogging and subsequent recovery (10 days) on plant growth to evaluate the variation in tolerance among 7 cool-season grain legume species, in sand culture in glasshouse experiments. Additionally waterlogging tolerance of 6 faba bean genotypes was also evaluated. Tolerance to waterlogging as indicated by root and shoot growth (as % of <b>drained</b> <b>controls)</b> was ranked as follows: faba bean> yellow lupin> grass pea> narrow-leafed lupin> chickpea> lentil>field pea. Faba bean produced adventitious roots and aerenchyma leading to increased root porosity (9 % gas volume per unit root volume). Among the 6 faba bean genotypes screened, accession 794 showed the best waterlogging tolerance, {{but it was also}} the slowest growing accession, which might have contributed to apparent tolerance (i. e. growth as % <b>drained</b> <b>control).</b> It is concluded that waterlogging tolerance in grain legumes varied between and within species, with faba bean being the most tolerant.

40|$|Flooding {{responses}} in Spartina patens propagated from plants collected in dune, swale, and marsh habitats {{were examined in}} a 63 d time-course experiment. Leaf growth rates and anatomical and metabolic responses did not depend upon plant population, suggesting {{that there were no}} physiologically significant differences in soil waterlogging responses among source populations. Flooding resulted in significant declines in soil redox potential and root specific gravity (indicating increased root aeration). Root alcohol dehydrogenase activity (ADH, a measure of the capacity to ferment ethanol) increased within 3 d of flooding, then exhibited a significant decline as root aeration increased (i. e. as root specific gravity decreased). However, maximal aerenchyma development (50 % of the root volume after 29 d) reduced but did not eliminate hypoxic stress in the roots. When plants that were flooded for 63 d were drained, ADH activity fell to levels equivalent to <b>drained</b> <b>controls.</b> These results support the following inferences: (1) Soil waterlogging dramatically increases root ADH activity. (2) Impact of soil waterlogging on root metabolism diminishes once internal root aeration increases. (3) Under severe chemically-reducing soil conditions, root aerenchyma formation, which adjusts to the prevalent degree of soil waterlogging, cannot provide roots with sufficient oxygen to support aerobic respiration completely...|$|R
40|$|Waterlogging {{is a major}} {{environmental}} stress for wheat grown in areas with high rainfall. To identify tolerant lines and determine the genomic regions carrying tolerance genes within the wheat genome, a doubled haploid (DH) mapping population from a cross of Ducula- 4 (tolerant CIMMYT line) and Brookton (susceptible, adapted Western Australian wheat line) parental lines was studied. DH lines and parental lines were grown in waterlogged and non-waterlogged treatments in pots. Waterlogging was imposed at 3 - 4 leaf stage and continued for 6 weeks to simulate waterlogging under natural field conditions. Root and shoot growth measurements identified transgressive segregants in the population.

40|$|A {{new type}} of imaging sensor {{suitable}} for digital SLR cameras has been developed. Each pixel in the sensor comprises a buried photodiode, a junction field-effect transistor (JFET), a transfer gate, two reset gates, and a reset drain. The JFET receives signal charge directly from the buried photodiode through the transfer gate and outputs the converted voltage signal, while the reset gate together with the reset <b>drain</b> <b>controls</b> both resetting and selecting operations of the JFET. The pixel {{does not have a}} floating diffusion nor a row select gate, resulting in a simplified structure, an increased fill factor and a better production yield. Another feature of the sensor is the parallel readout scheme.

This enables high-speed readout without introducing fixed pattern noise. Total and effective pixel numbers are 4. 26 and 4. 08 mega respectively. A pixel size is 9. 4 um square with a fill factor of 36 %. Power consumption is 600 mW under consecutive operation mode of 9. 3 frames/sec.

40|$|The manual {{segmentation}} {{and analysis}} of high-resolution multi-slice cardiac CT datasets is both labor intensive and time consuming. Therefore {{it is necessary to}} supply the cardiologist with powerful software tools to segment the myocardium and compute the relevant diagnostic parameters. In this work we present an semi-automatic cardiac segmentation approach with minimal user interaction. It is based on a combination of an adaptive slice-based region-growing and a modified Active Shape Model (ASM). Starting with a single manual click point in the ascending aorta, the aorta, the left atrium and the left ventricle get segmented with the slice based adaptive region-growing. The approximate position of the aortic and mitral valve as well as the principal axes of the left ventricle (LV) are determined. To prevent the region-growing from draining into neighboring anatomical structures via CT artifacts, we implemented a <b>draining</b> <b>control</b> by examining a cubic region around the currently processed voxel. Additionally, we use moment-based parameters to integrate simple anatomical knowledge into the region-growing process. Using the results of the preceding region-growing process, a ventricle-centric and normalized coordinate system is established which is used to adapt a previously trained ASM to the image, using an iterative multiresolution approach. After fitting the ASM to the image, we can use the generated model points to create an exact surface model of the left ventricular myocardium for visualization and for computing the diagnostically relevant parameters, like the ventricular blood volume and the myocardial wall thickness...|$|R

40|$|The {{original}} publication can {{be found}} at www. springerlink. comPeriodic flooding of perennial crops such as lucerne (Medicago sativa,L) is a major cause of lowered productivity and leads in extreme cases to plant death. In this study, effects of waterlogging and subsequent recovery on plant nutrient composition and PSII photochemistry were studied {{to gain a better understanding}} of the mechanisms of recovery as they relate to leaf photochemistry (chlorophyll fluorescence) and nutrient dynamics. Three lucerne cultivars and one breeding line were flooded for 20 d, drained and left to recover for another 16 d under glasshouse conditions. Leaf and root nutrient composition (P, K, Ca, Mg, B, Cu and Zn) of waterlogged lucerne was significantly lower than in freely <b>drained</b> <b>controls,</b> leaf N concentrations were also significantly lower in waterlogged lucerne. At the same time, there were significantly (5 -fold) higher concentrations of Fe in waterlogged roots and Na in leaves (2 -fold) of stressed plants. PS II photochemistry, which was impaired due to waterlogging, recovered almost fully after 16 d of free drainage in all genotypes. Alongside fluorescence recovery, concentrations of several nutrients also increased in recovered plants. Growth parameters, however, remained suppressed after draining. The latter was due to both the smaller capacity of CO₂ assimilation in previously waterlogged plants (caused in part by nutrient deficiency and associated inhibition of PSII) and the plant’s need to re-direct available nutrient and assimilate pools to repair the damage to the photosynthetic apparatus and roots. It is concluded, that for any lucerne-breeding program it is important to determine not only the degree of tolerance to waterlogging but also the potential for recovery of different genotypes, as well as look for ‘outstanding individuals’ within each population...|$|R
