5000|$|There is an {{increasing}} consciousness among the Amish {{of the advantages of}} exogamy. A <b>common</b> <b>bloodline</b> in one community will often be absent in another, and genetic disorders can be avoided by choosing spouses from unrelated communities. For example, the founding families of the Lancaster County Amish are unrelated to the founders of the Perth County Amish community in Canada.|$|E
50|$|The Amish are {{conscious}} {{of the advantages of}} exogamy. A <b>common</b> <b>bloodline</b> in one community will often be absent in another, and genetic disorders can be avoided by choosing spouses from unrelated communities. For example, the founding families of the Lancaster County Amish are unrelated to the founders of the Perth County, Ontario Amish community. Because of a smaller gene pool, some groups have increased incidences of certain inheritable conditions.|$|E
5000|$|In the Iron Age {{and early}} Medieval times, {{the region was}} {{controlled}} by a family or tribe known as the Corco Modhruadh, meaning [...] "seed" [...] or [...] "people of Modhruadh". They were {{one of dozens of}} minor tribes in Ireland at that time, which occupied a discrete area (tuath) and were joined by a <b>common</b> <b>bloodline</b> or origin myths. By the time Christianity arrived locally, their territory had shrunk somewhat, encompassing what later became the Baronies of Burren and Corcomroe as well as some parts of Inchiquin barony (see below).|$|E
50|$|Currently Paragaswewa has a {{population}} of more than 200 people belonging to 65 families.All are Sinhalese, and all are related, having <b>common</b> <b>bloodlines.</b>|$|R
50|$|The creole {{had also}} been {{developing}} in the present-day British Virgin Islands. The British took over the islands from the Dutch in 1672. Enslaved Africans were brought to work on plantations on the islands of Tortola, Virgin Gorda, Anegada and Jost Van Dyke where they, like those enslaved on St. Croix over 40 miles away, developed an English-based creole. Although the U.S. and British Virgin Islands are politically separate, they share a common Virgin Islands culture, similar history based on colonialism and slavery, and some <b>common</b> <b>bloodlines.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Like {{those in}} the Virgin Islands, African slaves {{were brought to the}} SSS islands of Saba, Sint Eustatius and Saint Martin. The {{prevalence}} of Europeans from the British Isles on these islands, as well as the SSS islands' proximity and trade with nearby English-speaking islands, resulted in an English creole being spoken in the SSS islands. The [...] "ancestral" [...] inhabitants (descendants of the original African slaves and European colonists) of the SSS islands share <b>common</b> <b>bloodlines</b> and a <b>common</b> culture with those of the U.S. and British Virgin Islands.|$|R
50|$|Urbanization is {{not merely}} a modern phenomenon, but a rapid and {{historic}} transformation of human social roots on a global scale, whereby predominantly rural culture is being rapidly replaced by predominantly urban culture. The first major change in settlement patterns was the accumulation of hunter-gatherers into villages many thousand years ago. Village culture is characterized by <b>common</b> <b>bloodlines,</b> intimate relationships and communal behavior whereas urban culture is characterized by distant bloodlines, unfamiliar relations and competitive behavior. This unprecedented movement of people is forecast to continue and intensify during the next few decades, mushrooming cities to sizes unthinkable only a century ago.|$|R
5|$|Ivalice is {{a kingdom}} of seven territories; Fovoham, Gallione, Limberry, Lionel, Zeltennia, the Holy Territory of Murond (Mullonde in later versions), and the Royal Capital of Lesalie (Lesalia in later versions), Ivalice's neighbors are {{the kingdom of}} Ordalia {{in the east and}} Romanda, a {{military}} nation to the north, across the Rhana Strait. While the three nations share <b>common</b> royal <b>bloodlines,</b> major wars have taken place between them. An influential religious institution known as the Murond Glabados Church heads the dominant faith, centering around a religious figure known as Saint Ajora.|$|R
5|$|The {{steamship}} Killarney {{arrived in}} Bangkok on April 26. How {{they would be}} received was speculative, since Hawaii had no treaty with Siam. Upon arrival, they were carried aboard a royal yacht up the Menam River to Bangkok. From there, they were carried on silk chairs {{to one of the}} many palaces in Bangkok for the duration of their visit. The following day they met with King Chulalongkorn who told Kalākaua that the Siamese and Native Hawaiians were related by the <b>common</b> Malayan <b>bloodline.</b> A member of the Siamese royal family escorted Kalākaua to see the nation's famed white elephants.|$|R
50|$|The {{family is}} listed in the medieval records of Kilkenny and Waterford, and are shown {{aligning}} themselves, through marriage, with the O'Kelly (Irish: Ó Caellaighe) sept, who were the ancient Kings of upper Ossory, by the marriage of Edmond Forstall and Elizabeth O'Kelly, daughter of Walter O'Kelly. Many of the modern day Forrestals descend from this noble union. Furthermore, they are also listed in the Irish genealogical records of the 17th century at the Library of Ireland in Dublin, showing intermarriage with the Kavanaghs, FitzGeralds, O'Neills, Alywards, Cantwells, O'Bolgers, Butlers of Ormond and O'Kennedys, which through these marriages they share <b>common</b> ancestors and <b>bloodlines.</b>|$|R
