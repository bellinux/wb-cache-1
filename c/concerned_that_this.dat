5|$|John Scott Haldane was {{commissioned}} by the Royal Navy to develop a safe decompression procedure. The current method was a slow linear decompression, and Haldane was <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was ineffective due to additional nitrogen buildup in the slow {{early stages of the}} ascent.|$|E
5|$|In a {{manuscript}} {{he wrote in}} 1704 (never intended to be published) he mentions the date of 2060, {{but it is not}} given as a date for the end of days. It has been falsely reported as a prediction. The passage is clear, when you read the date in context. He was against date setting for the end of days, <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> would put Christianity into disrepute.|$|E
5|$|For his String Quartet, Lutosławski had {{produced}} only the four instrumental parts, refusing to bind {{them in a}} full score, because he was <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> would imply that he wanted notes in vertical alignment to coincide, {{as is the case}} with conventionally notated classical ensemble music. The LaSalle Quartet, however, specifically requested a score from which to prepare for the first performance. Bodman Rae relates that Danuta Lutoslawska solved this problem by cutting up the parts and sticking them together in boxes (which Lutosławski called mobiles), with instructions on how to signal in performance when all of the players should proceed to the next mobile. In his orchestral music, these problems of notation were not so difficult, because the instructions on how and when to proceed are given by the conductor.|$|E

5|$|Lunalilo left no heirs. The {{legislature}} was {{empowered by}} the constitution to elect the monarch in these instances and chose David Kalākaua as the next monarch. The new ruler was pressured by the U.S. government to surrender Pearl Harbor to the Navy. Kalākaua was <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> would lead to annexation by the U.S. and to the contravening of {{the traditions of the}} Hawaiian people, who believed that the land ('Āina) was fertile, sacred, and not for sale to anyone. In 1875, the United States Congress agreed to an additional seven years of reciprocity in exchange for Ford Island. At the end of the seven-year reciprocity agreement, the United States showed little interest in renewal.|$|E
5|$|En {{route to}} Cadiz, Linois {{had learned from}} {{the crew of the}} {{captured}} brig HMS Speedy that a powerful British squadron of seven ships of the line under Rear-Admiral Sir James Saumarez lay off Cadiz, blockading the port. <b>Concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> squadron could overwhelm his own, Linois took shelter in the small but well-defended harbour of Algeciras, just across Algeciras Bay from the heavily fortified British naval base at Gibraltar. Saumarez was informed of Linois's arrival, and turned eastwards to confront him, discovering the French ships anchored in a well prepared position on the morning of 6 July. Saumarez attacked immediately, but found that his ships were hampered by a lack of wind. Becalmed under heavy fire, the British squadron inflicted severe damage on the French ships which withdrew into shallower water, two grounding. However, when Saumarez ordered his ships to follow, HMS Hannibal grounded as well, trapped under a heavy barrage from the shore. With no wind with which to manoeuvre and the squadron's boats all either sunk or engaged in towing the battered HMS Pompée back to Gibraltar, Saumarez called off the attack at 13:35. The battered British squadron retired to Gibraltar, except for Hannibal, which was trapped, battered and swiftly forced to surrender, having lost two masts and more than 140 men.|$|E
5|$|Engine {{packaging}} {{became a}} contentious issue during development. Holden's designers wanted the engine positioned well {{behind the front}} axle to allow short overhangs and an overall sportier appearance, whereas the crash engineers were <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> would reduce the body's impact absorption in an accident. Negotiation between designers and crash engineers resulted in moving some of the engine components, including relocating the battery to the boot, freeing up valuable front-end space. By having the engine moved back and further down, the VE Commodore also benefits from near perfect 50:50 weight distribution across all variants, leading to superior handling. Crash engineers introduced several other safety initiatives, including relocating the fuel tank {{in front of the}} rear-axle line, instead of behind. A more crash-resistant rear-end was also seen as necessary. The design though had to incorporate a spacious boot and a spare-wheel bay that could house the largest-sized wheel to be fitted to the car. Crash test results from Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) rate the VE lower in the offset frontal impact test than the previous generation Commodore. The overall crash score was marginally higher than the outgoing VZ, due to improvements in side impact protection giving a score of 27.45 out of 37 or a four star rating out of a possible five.|$|E

5|$|Within {{hours of}} departing from Toulon, the {{squadron}} {{was struck by}} a heavy gale. One of the ships of the line lost its mainmast and turned back for Toulon, and the remainder of the force was scattered. The British blockade force sighted the disparate squadron on the following morning and although the French escaped pursuit, HMS Minerve succeeded in capturing one of the isolated merchant vessels. By 25 March, all but three of Ganteaume's ships had been recovered and the force was limping southwards through the Tyrrhenian Sea when it ran directly into Warren's squadron as it returned from Sicily. Ganteaume turned southeastwards to escape and Warren gave chase, the faster vessels in his squadron gaining on the French but the slower ships, particularly HMS Gibraltar and HMS Athenienne, falling far behind. <b>Concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> placed his squadron in danger of becoming separated during the night, Warren ordered his faster ships to slow down and gradually lost sight of the French during the evening. Ganteaume took advantage of the respite to turn northwards in the darkness, and once again returned to Toulon.|$|E

25|$|The reactor's {{emergency}} diesel {{generators and}} DC batteries, crucial components in helping keep the reactors {{cool in the}} event of a power loss, were located in the basements of the reactor turbine buildings. The reactor design plans provided by General Electric specified placing the generators and batteries in that location, but mid-level engineers working on the construction of the plant were <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> made the backup power systems vulnerable to flooding. TEPCO elected to strictly follow General Electric's design in the construction of the reactors.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{its earlier}} involvement, the Discovery Institute was <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{would be a}} test case and that the {{defendants}} had earlier displayed their religious motivations. This tension led to disagreements with the Thomas More Law Center and the withdrawal of three Discovery Institute fellows as defense experts prior to their depositions– William A. Dembski, Stephen C. Meyer and John Angus Campbell. This was purportedly because the Thomas More Law Center refused to allow these witnesses {{to have their own}} attorneys present during deposition, but Discovery Institute director Bruce Chapman later said that he had asked them not to testify (as well as Behe and Minnich, who testified anyway).|$|E

25|$|The Navy had {{installed}} a high-powered Alexanderson alternator, built by General Electric (GE), at the American Marconi transmitter site in New Brunswick, New Jersey. It {{proved to be}} superior for transatlantic transmissions to the spark transmitters that had been traditionally used by the Marconi companies. Marconi officials were so impressed by {{the capabilities of the}} Alexanderson alternators that they began making preparations to adopt them as their standard transmitters for international communication. A tentative plan made with General Electric proposed that over a two-year period the Marconi companies would purchase most of GE's alternator production. However, this proposal was met with disapproval, on national security grounds, by the U.S. Navy, which was <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> would guarantee British domination of international radio communication.|$|E
25|$|Plans for a {{new stadium}} at Høddvoll were first {{articulated}} in 1951, resulting in a visit from NFF the following year to investigate the possibilities. The motion {{was passed by the}} club's annual meeting the same year and was included near the schools in the municipal zoning plan which was being revised. Hødd applied for a municipal grant in 1954. This resulted in a political disagreement as to the location of the new venue. The majority in the municipal council wanted the new stadium to be located at Høddvoll, while the minority called for it to be located next to the schools. This would have given a more central placement in town, but the majority was <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> would not give sufficient space for future school expansions, as well as giving higher construction costs. The municipality gave a grant of NOK10,000 towards land purchases, and Hødd paid NOK26,321 for the necessary land.|$|E
