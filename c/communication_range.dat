25|$|At 08:15, Keyes—with Lurcher {{and another}} destroyer—sighted two four-funnelled cruisers. Still unaware that any {{additional}} British ships {{had been sent}} to support the action, he signalled Invincible that he was chasing two German cruisers. Goodenough received the signal and abandoning his own search for enemy vessels to attack, steamed to assist Keyes against his own ships, Lowestoft and Nottingham. Keyes, seeing he was now being chased by four more enemy cruisers attempted to lead them towards Invincible and New Zealand, reporting them as enemy ships. Eventually, Keyes recognised Southampton, and the ships attempted to rejoin Tyrwhitt. However, the danger to Goodenough's ships was not over, since the British submarines were still unaware the additional ships were present. At 09:30, one of the British submarines attacked Southampton with two torpedoes, missing and in turn escaping when Southampton tried to ram. Lowestoft and Nottingham remained out of <b>communication</b> <b>range,</b> and separated from the rest of their squadron took no further part in the action.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWireless sensor {{networks}} (WSNs) {{have been}} broadly deployed in civil applications {{as it is}} economically feasible to deploy large number of sensors over a geographic area.

However, direct communication is feasible when the two sensor nodes are located within their ranges.

40|$|Abstract — In {{the near}} future, groups of {{autonomous}} robots using wireless communication {{will be used}} {{for a wide variety of}} tasks. In many such applications, communication may be unreliable and <b>communication</b> <b>ranges</b> difficult to predict. While most current approaches to this problem strive to keep team members within range of one another, we propose an approach in which navigation and exploration beyond range limits is explicitly planned for. Robots may either explore or relay known information, and the team hierarchy corresponds to a tree. As the exploration effort unfolds, robots swap roles within this tree to improve the efficiency of exploration. Since robots reactively adjust to communication availability, the resulting behaviour is robust to limited communication. This makes it particularly suitable for applications such as robotic search and rescue, where environments are likely to contain significant interference and unexpected <b>communication</b> <b>ranges...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In guided urban {{automated}} transportation systems, {{the maintenance}} of a high-quality broadband train-to-wayside communication at all locations along the track poses a major problem. Several techniques are currently used. However, to achieve sufficient rates, a <b>communication</b> frequency <b>range</b> of 2 – 6 GHz is widely in use. At these frequencies, the natural propagation in tunnels usually works efficiently, but the communication through a leaky waveguide that is continuously laid along the track has several advantages. Over the required <b>communication</b> <b>ranges</b> of several hundred meters, between stations, such waveguides provide low longitudinal attenuation and remain of reasonable size. They also provide predictable <b>communication</b> <b>ranges</b> that could offer significant advantages over the natural propagation approach. This paper will theoretically and experimentally describe such a technical solution. Using ray-optical modeling of the radio propagation in a railway-type tunnel, the radiation characteristics of such a system will be evaluated. At the same operating frequencies, it will be compared with a conventional base solution using antennas separated a few hundred meters apart. An example of a recently operational implemented system will be presented. Index Terms—Leaky wave antennas, propagation, train control, tunnels, waveguides. I...|$|R
