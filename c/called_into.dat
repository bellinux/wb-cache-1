5|$|Heskey was <b>called</b> <b>into</b> manager Fabio Capello's first squad against Switzerland, {{but had to}} {{withdraw}} due to an injury.

5|$|Bitterest {{of all was}} the {{whispering}} campaign {{directed at}} Anthony Molloy, captain of HMS Caesar. Molloy was accused of cowardice by fellow officers for his failure to follow Howe's orders on both 29 May and 1 June.

Molloy was dismissed from his ship.|$|E

Instead, vice-captain Hassett would move from the middle-order to accompany Morris {{at the top of the}} innings, while Harvey would slot into the middle-order.|$|E

5|$|Forster was, however, criticised in {{the early}} part of his time at Celtic for lacking {{confidence}} and command, and uncertain when he had the ball at his feet. In time he matured, with his confidence and kicking noticeably improved. His level of concentration was also noted; given Celtic's dominance over the majority of their opponents in Scotland, their goalkeeper often has long periods of inactivity, but when eventually <b>called</b> <b>into</b> action Forster was invariably alert and ready.|$|E

5|$|Ingham was capped {{once for}} Northern Ireland at under-18 level, making his only {{appearance}} in a 2–1 home defeat to the Republic of Ireland on 9 March 1999 in 1999 UEFA European Under-18 Championship qualifying. After being understudy to David Miskelly for two under-21 matches in 2000, Ingham made his debut in a 2–0 home defeat to the Czech Republic on 23 March 2001 in 2002 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualifying. Having made his last under-21 appearance in a 4–0 defeat to the Czech Republic on 5 June 2001 in another qualifier, his international career {{at this level}} concluded with four caps. Ingham was <b>called</b> <b>into</b> the senior Northern Ireland squad in August 2002 after Roy Carroll was released. He was <b>called</b> <b>into</b> the Northern Ireland B squad in May 2003, but was forced to withdraw because of injury. Ingham's form during a loan at Wrexham saw him placed on standby for Northern Ireland's match with Serbia and Montenegro in April 2004. He was named in the Northern Ireland squad for their tour of the Caribbean in May 2004, but dislocated a finger in training in June, which meant he missed out on making his debut.|$|E
