In fact, Papa Wemba had already used the Viva <b>la</b> <b>musica!</b> slogan in his former band Yoka Lokole, as a battlecry introducing sebene (dance) sections of their live performances, so the Congolese audience was already familiar with that name when Viva <b>La</b> <b>Musica</b> debuted in February 1977.|$|R
