50|$|Scaled quail {{are fairly}} sedentary. The winter home ranges of scaled quail <b>coveys</b> varied from 24 to 84 acre. The home ranges of {{separate}} <b>coveys</b> overlap only slightly {{or not at}} all. From September to November scaled quail <b>coveys</b> maintain stable territories. In Arizona, 75 to 90% of a population apparently moved off of a breeding area by mid-November, moving to nearby mountain foothills. The mountain habitat was consistent with that found on the breeding area. In March the population on the breeding area increased again, with most birds in groups of four to eight.|$|R

5|$|Oregon {{produces}} wine on a {{much smaller}} scale than the California wine industry. Oregon's leading producer, King Estate, ships only 401,400 cases per year and most produce under 35,000cases. The state features many small wineries that produce less than 5,000cases per year. In contrast, E & J Gallo, the United States' largest winery with more than 50 different brands including Washington's Columbia Winery and <b>Covey</b> Run holds 22.8% share of the US market. The majority of wineries in the state operate their own vineyards, although some purchase grapes on the market. Oregon contains {{a significant number of}} independent vineyards.|$|E
5|$|The Brewers {{have made}} ten {{selections}} in the supplemental {{round of the}} draft and have made one first overall selection in the draft. They have also had three compensatory picks since {{the institution of the}} First-Year Player Draft in 1965. These additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the prior off-season, or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year. The Brewers have failed to sign four of their first-round picks; Bill Bordley (1976), Alex Fernandez (1988), Kenny Henderson (1991), and Dylan <b>Covey</b> (2010).|$|E

Upon exiting Luzerne County, the stream enters Moosic, Lackawanna County and continues flowing north-northwest and {{receives the}} tributary <b>Covey</b> Swamp Creek from the right. The stream then turns west-southwest for a short distance before turning south and then west, crossing Interstate 81.

5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous of all Arabian {{breeding}} operations founded in Europe was the Crabbet Park Stud of England, founded 1878. Starting in 1877, Wilfrid Scawen Blunt and Lady Anne Blunt made repeated journeys to the Middle East, including visits to the stud of Ali Pasha Sherif in Egypt and to Bedouin tribes in the Nejd, bringing the best Arabians they could find to England. Lady Anne also purchased and maintained the Sheykh Obeyd stud farm in Egypt, near Cairo. Upon Lady Anne's death in 1917, the Blunts' daughter, Judith, Lady Wentworth, inherited the Wentworth title and Lady Anne's portion of the estate, and obtained the remainder of the Crabbet Stud following a protracted legal battle with her father. Lady Wentworth expanded the stud, added new bloodstock, and exported Arabian horses worldwide. Upon her death in 1957, the stud passed to her manager, Cecil <b>Covey,</b> who ran Crabbet until 1971, when a motorway was cut through the property, forcing the sale of the land and dispersal of the horses. Along with Crabbet, the Hanstead Stud of Lady Yule also produced horses of worldwide significance.|$|E

25|$|The {{next major}} hunting methods is the “high soar with {{vertical}} stoop”, {{which is used}} to attack birds in flight. Since they are outpaced and out-maneuvered by swift-flying birds, they can only usually attack slower-flying species such as geese and cranes. The golden eagle also requires a height advantage over their prey for this rarely observed technique to succeed. In one observed case, some Canada geese (Branta canadensis) in Montana were able to avoid predation by a golden eagle hunting them in this way by collectively gaining flying height. In another observation, a golden eagle was successful in knocking a ptarmigan out of a flying <b>covey</b> in Scotland.|$|E
