40|$|Weeds {{compete with}} peach trees for water, light, and nutrients. The {{primary goal of}} weed {{management}} is to optimize yield by minimizing weed competition. Weed control is {{a key component of}} integrated orchard management. Weeds impact orchard productivity and health by competing with trees and by acting as hosts for a variety of pests. Weeds are hosts for <b>catfacing</b> insects, which damage and distort fruit. Winter annual broadleaf weed control is a key part of managing <b>catfacing</b> insects in peach. Weeds may also act as hosts for nematodes that vector viral diseases and nematodes that contribute to premature orchard decline. In areas where voles contribute to tree loss, maintenance of clean, bare orchard floor beneath the trees is a key part of vole control. Maintaining a bare soil surface under peach trees can also minimize crop losses associated with spring frosts. Bare soil surfaces, free of weeds or plant residue, absorb more heat during the day. The release of the absorbed heat at night can increase orchard temperatures by a few degrees. This is commonly referred to as the radiant heat benefit. Although temperature changes are modest, they can be enough to prevent fruit loss during spring freeze events. IMPACT OF COMPETITION Weeds compete with trees for light, water, and nutrients. Weed competition for light is normally not a problem with established trees. However, large weeds in newly planted orchards can shade and severel...|$|R

40|$|The <b>catface</b> rockcod Epinephelus andersoni is a range-restricted {{species that}} is endemic to the {{southeast}} coast of Africa from Quissico in Mozambique (subtropical) to Knysna in South Africa (warmtemperate). Its complex life-history, long-lived nature and high residency make E. andersoni potentially vulnerable to over-exploitation. Epinephelus andersoni is an important fishery species and has shown signs of depletion. Due to inadequate information necessary for management and conservation, further research is vital, particularly {{in the face of}} potentially significant climatic changes which could put further pressure on E. andersoni. The aim {{of the study was to}} provide information for the management of E. andersoni, with considerations for the possibly detrimental effects of future climate change. The objectives of this study were to describe the genetic structure and diversity of E. andersoni and to determine possible range shifts of E. andersoni with future changes in sea surface temperature. Genetic samples were collected throughout the distribution of E. andersoni. Standard DNA extraction and PCR using universal primers were conducted and nuclear (RPS 7 - 1) and mitochondrial (cytochrome b) data were analysed to determine genetic diversity. A combination of nuclear and mitochondrial markers was used to ensure that the results were robust. RPS 7 - 1 haplotype diversity was high (0. 801) and an AMOVA on the RPS 7 - 1 data showed significantly high among group variation (ΦCT = 0. 204, p < 0. 05) between five groups: 1. Quissico to Inhaca; 2. Cape Vidal to Port Edward; 3 Port St Johns to Coffee Bay; 4. Mbashe; 5. Port Alfred. This geographic structuring could be attributed to low gene flow across barriers such as the Port Alfred upwelling cell, the Mozambique Channel eddies and smaller more localised upwelling cells such as the Port St Johns cell. The cytochrome b results contrastingly indicate low haplotype diversity (0. 309) and no differentiation (ΦCT = 0. 265, p = 0. 074) between groups and support the hypothesis of a historical population bottleneck. This may be due to an unusually slower mutation rate of the cytochrome b region than the RPS 7 - 1 region, resulting in the RPS 7 - 1 data showing a more recent picture of diversification. To complement the genetic results, niche modelling techniques were used to determine range shifts of E. andersoni with future temperature trends using species distribution and climatic data. The model illustrated a contraction of the E. andersoni distribution as well as future intensification of various upwelling cells along the south-east African coast including the Port Alfred upwelling cell. Due to the low gene flow across these barriers this intensification could decrease the resilience of E. andersoni, as its range becomes more limited with global change. The genetic data and modelling results combined provide useful information on which to base future fisheries management...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2005. In {{order to}} assess and improve their management, {{a survey of the}} {{commercial}} and recreational marine linefisheries in Richards Bay was conducted from June 2002 to July 2004. The ultimate aim of this survey was to develop a sound management framework for the commercial and recreational marine Iinefisheries in Richards Bay. Skippers on both commercial and recreational skiboats were all white males in their mid- 40 s whom were fairly experienced. There were twice as many crew on commercial than recreational skiboats. The crew on commercial skiboats were mostly black males while on recreational skiboats, crew were mostly white males. Slinger was the most important species caught by commercial fishermen off Richards Bay, accounting {{for the vast majority of}} catches by number and mass. The total contribution by sparids to commercial catches amounts to approximately 93 % by number and 81 % by mass. Recreational catches comprised a greater variety of species (73 recreational species versus 54 commercial species), signifying a less focussed targeting approach compared to commercial skiboat fishermen. Although slinger also numerically dominated recreational linefish catches, <b>catface</b> rockcod were most important by mass. Although there were five times more recreational outings during the study, total catch by commercial skiboat fishermen was five times higher than that of recreational fishermen. This was expected, as the average duration of each commercial outing is more than twice that of recreational outings and the crew numbers are higher. Commercial skiboat fishermen in Richards Bay are also more effective, as the average number of fish caught per man per hour on commercial skiboats was approximately 4 times greater than that on recreational skiboats. Total estimated catch for the commercial sector was 28 tonnes and 173 tonnes for the recreational sector. Comparison of data between this survey and commercial data available on NMLS showed similar species composition, although the dominance of slinger was 20 % higher in this survey compared to data. Similarly, within the recreational sector, there was a close similarity in catch composition between this survey and that catch inspections. The profit (excluding the costs of fixed assets) that each commercial fisherman earns per month was estimated to be in the region ofR 8 500. However, if one examines the value of the commercial linefishery as a whole, it appears that there is a net loss of R 90 000 per year, excluding the costs of fixed assets. The discrepancy stems from the disparity between the recorded number of launches and the number reported by skippers. Most of the commercially caught fish are not sold in Richards Bay, but are exported to Gauteng. The average monthly Iinefish catch by commercial fishermen was less than half the average estimated consumption of Iinefish in Richards Bay, and the difference appears to be made up from recreational catches, with many consumers indicating that they either caught their own fish or were given it. Knowledge of and compliance with fishing regulations by commercial and recreational skiboat fishermen in Richards Bay was reasonably good. The main recommendations emanating from this study include continuous monitoring of the Richards Bay commercial and recreational line fishery in order to determine the efficacy of the new regulations, the development of area-based commercial linefishing permits and the possible introduction of restrictions on the sale of fish outside of the Richards Bay area...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) -University of Natal, Durban, 2000. The family Serranidae is {{a diverse}} group of fishes, of which the genus Epinephelus (rockcods or groupers) is the largest. Serranids are {{commonly}} caught in reef fisheries in tropical and warm-temperate latitudes, and are targeted because of their tasty flesh and high value. In South Africa, epinepheline serranids mainly occur in hook and line fisheries in the province of KwaZulu-Natal. Mostserranids are caught by the boat-based (skiboat) fishery, and the commonestspecies are the endemic <b>catface</b> rockcod (Epinephelus andersoni), thehalfmoon rockcod (E. rivulatus), the yellowbelly rockcod (E. marginatus) and the endemic white-edge rockcod (E. albomarginatus). Although serranids contribute about ten percent to catches by the commercial and recreational skiboat sectors in KwaZulu-Natal, representing an estimated total catch of around 200 mt per year, little is known about these fishes in South Africa. From the mid- 1980 s to the mid- 1990 s, the mean lengths of E. marginatus and E. albomarginatus in the region declined significantly. Over this period, lengths of E. andersoni remained the same, while those of E. rivulatus increased. Lengths of E. marginatus and E. albomarginatus from Mozambique, where fishing effort was low at the time of sampling, were significantly greater than in KwaZulu-Natal. Monthly biological data were mostly collected from commercial skiboat catches on the northern and southern coast of KwaZulu-Natal. Additional data for E. marginatus and E. albomarginatus were also collected irregularly from commercial catches made in Mozambique. Unless the fish had ripe ovaries, all gonads had to be sectioned to establish sex and stage. Histology revealed that all gonads had a female-like appearance, with lamellae and a central lumen. In E. andersoni, there was a complete overlap of male and female length frequencies, and their meanlengths were not significantly different. Some males and inactive bisexuals were both smaller and younger than the female size and age at first maturity. Together with the occurrence of mature bisexual fish (transitionals), these observations indicate that males are derived from immature or mature females, hence this species is a diandric protogynous hermaphrodite. The other three species exhibit typical signs of monandric protogynous hermaphroditism. Males and females had significantly different mean lengths, and age and length frequencies by sex werebimodal. Transitional individuals were recorded in E. rivulatus. E. andersoni and E. rivulatus matured at small sizes and early ages relative to E. marginatus and E. albomarginatus. Ripe ovaries were much larger than ripe testes in all four species. E. andersoni, E. marginatus and E. albomarginatus spawned in spring and summer, while E. rivulatus spawned in winter and spring. There were no indications of spawning in E. andersoni in the southern sampling region, and few ripe individuals of E. albomarginatus were encountered in KwaZulu-Natal samples. Size at maturity of this species was much smaller in Mozambique samples. Large, reproductively inactive individuals of E. andersoni were frequently observed in the spawning season. The lack of reproductive activity of E. andersoni and E. albomarginatus in KwaZulu-Natal may be because this area represents thesouthernmost limit of the distribution of these species. Ageing of the four species was undertaken using sectioned otoliths. Age validation was undertaken by a combination of tetracycline marking in captive fishes, and analysis of the marginal zone in otoliths. All four species are relatively long-lived, although estimates of maximum age may be under-estimated because of long-term harvesting. In all four species, fish from the southern sampling region were larger than fish from the northern region at the same age. Only in the case of E. rivulatus were these significant enough to warrant the fitting of two growth curves to the northern and southern populations. Males in all four species tended to be larger than females at the same age, suggesting {{that there may be a}} growth spurt following sex change, or that faster-growing females changed sex. A logistic growth curve was fitted to the age-length data for E. andersoni, while von Bertalanffy curves produced the best fit for the other species. Based on the rates at which L∞ attained in these four species, E. marginatus and E. albomarginatus are slow-growing species, while E. andersoni and, particularly, E. rivulatus arefaster growing. Rates of total mortality and natural mortality were estimated using length-converted catch curves and the Rikhter and Efanov equation, respectively. Stock assessments undertaken by yield per recruit and spawner biomass per recruit analyses indicate that E. andersoni in KwaZulu-Natal is currently optimally exploited, while E. rivulatus is lightly exploited. Both E. marginatus and E. albomarginatus are over-exploited. The potential problems in applying standard per recruit models to species with complex life histories are discussed. Support for the reduced stock status of the latter two species is provided by the observed changes in lengths of these species over a ten-year period, and their relatively small size in KwaZulu-Natal compared to the lightly-fished Mozambique populations. Local fishers in KwaZulu-Natal have also reported declines in sizes and reduced catches of these two species. The life history styles and other features of the four species are compared and discussed with reference to the resilience of these species to harvesting. Two of the species (E. marginatus and E. albomarginatus) are monandric protogynous hermaphrodites, which grow slowly, mature late and attain large sizes. E. andersoni and E. rivulatus grow faster, mature earlier and are smaller species. The normally deleterious effects of fishing on sex-changing species are not manifested in these two species, possibly because E. rivulatus is so small, that males are not selectively removed. In contrast, E. andersoni is a diandric protogynous hermaphrodite, and hence, does not rely on sex-change as a source of males. The current management methods for serranids in KwaZulu-Natal are presented, and suggestions for future approaches are discussed...|$|E
