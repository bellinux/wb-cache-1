The influence of vegetation on the mobility of pesticide adjuvants was also investigated. Modifications to the laboratory setup of soil columns for studying various pesticides, degradation products, and adjuvants were done to fit the needs of the particular compound being studied. To improve mass balances of volatile parent compounds, such as methyl bromide, as well as biodegradable (mineralizable) pesticide degradation products such as deethylatrazine, modifications of columns to accommodate isolation of volatile degradation products were accomplished by enclosure of the column head space and use of flow-through systems. Evidence of preferential flow of atrazine, deethylatrazine, metolachlor, and methyl bromide were indicated by the presence of either the 14 C-compound or Br-(in the case of methyl bromideapplied soil columns) after the first leaching event. Diffusion through the soil matrix was also evident with a peak of 14 C in the leachate several weeks after pesticide (or degradate) application to the soil column. Deethylatrazine, a major degradate of atrazine, was more mobile than the parent <b>compound.</b> <b>Vegetation</b> had a significant positive effect on reducing the mobility of the adjuvants propylene glycol and ethylene glycol...|$|E

The ability of different taxa of trees to form a secondary crown after opening a canopy is genetically conditioned and influenced by the specific terms of habitat, tree age, physiological state {{of the individual and}} the specific characteristics of the individual. As a model plant for this dissertation thesis was chosen a representative of the Quercus L. genus which is very frequently used in landscape architecture. Specifically, Quercus cerris L. taxon was chosen which is grown in forest stands of Lednice-Valtice Cultural Landscape as a monoculture. Field research was conducted in forest stand edges of Forest management unit Židlochovice, namely in forest district Valtice. In this forest district were found suitable sites that meet the condition of chosen evaluation methodology, allowing comparable statistical evaluation. Enough suitable forest stand edges were found that were selected for the experiment. To the topic of secondary crown formation after opening a canopy and practical utilization of secondary crown is paid only little attention in specialized publications and in both basic and applied research. This thesis brings knowledge that can significantly contribute to the development and importance of field Landscape architecture in contemporary society. The thesis brings a lot of new information and relationships that occur during tree crown regeneration when opening a canopy. These findings can be used for example during the regeneration of untended objects of garden art monuments and other objects of landscape architecture. The results may also help in the conversion of forest stands to different objects of landscape architecture both in urban and rural settlements. The results allow modeling the development of woody plant vegetation elements in these objects. It is clear that arbitrary regenerative ability of secondary crown formation and thus the replacement of the primary crown is not sufficient but it is always necessary to respond on this ability of regeneration by various means of tree care measures so that the whole intention reaches the optimal result. The results indicate that primary or secondary woody plant vegetation element opening a canopy is able to regenerate in order to increase its landscaping value or to increase its dendrological potential of the <b>compound</b> <b>vegetation</b> element. Knowledge can also be used for regeneration of trees on the newly created forest stand edges, historical parks or other compound woody plant vegetation elements...|$|E

40|$|Arctic tundra {{ecosystems}} contain 14 % of {{the global}} soil carbon (C) store which is becoming vulnerable to decomposition. Arctic soil organic matter (SOM) contains large amounts of old, recalcitrant, high molecular weight (MW) C compounds which are protected from decomposition whilst soils remain frozen. Climatic change alters soil temperature and water regimes in the Arctic, however, {{the impact of these}} changes on C decomposition and storage is poorly understood. We investigated vegetation emergence, microbial dynamics and nutrient fluxes in response to snow melt on the high Arctic Svalbard archipelago using field and laboratory studies. Using bacterial and archaeal genetic material (16 S rRNA) and ammonia-oxidising genes, microbial communities were quantified in transects across the active snow melt front. The effects of soil temperature and water content on SOM decomposition rates were measured using 14 C-labelled low and high MW <b>compounds.</b> <b>Vegetation</b> and below-ground microbial communities, in the field, responded rapidly with peaks in nutrient availability and soil respiration observed within 72 h of snowmelt. Temperature strongly drives early growing season C dynamics in the Arctic. We suggest the nutrient peaks following snowmelt, coupled with higher levels of DNA in the subniveal zone are due to the decomposition of bacteria and archaea from previous years. We show, in the laboratory, when soils thaw, mineralisation of recalcitrant C (high MW) compounds was sensitive to soil water but not to increasing temperatures. In contrast, low MW compounds exhibited sensitivity to both temperature and soil water. We suggest that if future soil water content increases under climate change, high MW compounds could become more susceptible to decomposition, releasing more C to the atmosphere...|$|R

Recent developments include: a higher estimate of the LGM-PI change in methane emissions from wetlands―the dominant, natural methane source; and the possible recycling of OH consumed in isoprene oxidation―the principal methane sink. Here, in view of these developments, we use an atmospheric chemistry-transport model to re-examine the main factors affecting OH during this period: changes in air temperature and emissions of non-methane volatile organic <b>compounds</b> from <b>vegetation.</b> We find that their net effect was negligible(with and without an OH recycling mechanism), implyingthe change in [CH 4] was almost entirely source driven―a conclusion that, though subject to significant uncertainties,can be reconciled with recent methane source estimates. ...|$|R

The potentially large expansion of isoprene emitting species (e. g., poplars) for bioenergy production might, therefore, impact tropospheric O 3 formation. Using the eddy covariance technique we have simultaneously measured fluxes isoprene, O 3 and of CO 2 from a poplar (Populus) plantation grown for bioenergy production. We used the chemistry transport model LOTOS-EUROS to scale-up the isoprene emissions associated with the existing poplar plantations in Europe, and we assessed the impact of isoprene fluxes on ground level O 3 concentrations. Our findings suggest that isoprene emissions from existing poplar-for-bioenergy plantations do not significantly affect the ground level of O 3 concentration. Indeed the overall land in Europe covered with poplar plantations has not significantly changed over the last two decades despite policy incentives to produce bioenergy crops. The current surface area of isoprene emitting poplars-for-bioenergy remains too limited to significantly enhance O 3 concentrations and thus to be considered a potential threat for air quality and human health. © The Author(s) 2016...|$|R

Over the past five years, researchers from universities, state and federal agencies, private industry, and local governments have joined forces to conduct air quality modeling studies and air quality field studies designed to help inform critical air quality management decisions. This document summarizes the findings from these studies. Some of the most critical findings are: Emissions Along the Texas Gulf Coast, emissions of reactive hydrocarbons from industrial facilities can lead to rapid ozone formation and accumulation, causing exceedances of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone.

40|$|A {{model for}} {{predicting}} concentrations of dioxin-like compounds in beef is developed and tested. The key {{premise of the}} model is that concentrations of these compounds in air are the source term, or starting point, for estimating beef concentrations. Vapor-phase concentrations transfer to vegetations cattle consume, and particle-bound concentrations deposit onto soils and these vegetations as well. Congener-specific bioconcentration parameters, coupled with assumptions on cattle diet, transform soil and vegetative concentrations into beef fat concentrations. The premise of the validation exercise is that a profile of typical air concentrations of dioxin-like compounds in a United States rural environment is an appropriate observed independent data set, and that a representative profile of United States beef concentrations of dioxin-like compounds 2 is an appropriate observed dependent result. These data were developed for the validation exercise. An observed concentration of dioxin toxic equivalents in whole beef of 0. 48 ng/kg is compared with a predicted 0. 36 ng/kg. Principal uncertainties in the approach are identified and discussed.

The impact of vegetation responses to increasing atmospheric CO₂ concentrations on the hydrologic cycle is particularly poorly constrained.

40|$|Explosive {{compounds}} are broadly distributed {{across the}} globe {{as a result of}} nearly two centuries of munitions use in warfare and military activities. Two explosive compounds have seen disproportionate use; RDX (hexahydro- 1, 3, 5 -trinitro- 1, 3, 5 -triazine) and TNT (2 -methyl- 1, 3, 5 -trinitrobenzene), being the most commonly found explosives in the environment. The effects of explosives on biota have been studied in great detail; however, there is a general lack of understanding with regard to broader ecological impacts of these contaminants. My dissertation objective was to follow the impacts of explosive <b>compounds</b> on <b>vegetation</b> across scales. Impacts on vegetation at the species scale alter community composition via species-specific and age-specific responses to explosives. Results presented here showed that contaminated soils induced a variety of responses in vegetation, yet impacts to water relations were similar regardless of species. Use of novel metrics in monitoring plant responses to explosives compounds aided in delineation of reference and treatment groups. At the community scale the presence of explosives induced species and functional composition shifts. The observed shifts are likely due to physiological impairment as individuals in the field exhibited significant impacts to physiological functions. Effects of explosives contamination also detectable using remote sensing techniques. Impacts to plant morphology and physiology are directly related to community level shifts observed in long contaminated areas. This highlights the long lasting impacts that these largely overlooked contaminants can have on a system and opens avenues for new, at range, vegetation based contaminant detection systems...|$|R
40|$|Blackwater {{rivers and}} lakelets {{are a common}} feature of the {{landscape}} in the South Western Cape. Contrastingly, white rivers {{can also be found}} in the region. Key to the colour of blackwaters is the increased presence of dissolved organic carbon. The vegetation of the regions is known to posses' large amounts of polyphenols and potentially low microbial decomposition. Therefore, are the plant-soil dynamics a possible answer to variation in river colour? To answer this, the chemical correlates of rivers in the region, along with the in vitro leaching of the fynbos vegetation compared to other types and the effects of nutrient fertilisation on microbial activity in soil were determined. The results revealed that organic carbon, Fe and pH are significantly correlated with blackwaters. The Fe in the water appears to be bound to humic <b>compounds.</b> Fynbos <b>vegetation</b> is able to produce greater concentrations of polyphenol leachates (315 mg/l humic acid) compared to savanna species (246 mg/ humic acid) over a four-day period. P fertilisations increased the concentrations of humic acids from 30 mg/ 1 to 200 mg/l in some soils through their affinity to bind with humic compounds. The N fertilisations moderately increased the humic acid concentrations and in some cases lowered the concentration by 10 mg/l, indicating that it provided a nutrient source to the microbes for carbon breakdown. The interactions between humic compounds, nutrients and Fe are key to the formation of blackwaters in the region. Attached to this is the limited decomposition that takes place due to nutrient limitations. Therefore, the interactions between the carbon leached from the vegetation and below ground activities are determinants of water colour in the South Western Cape...|$|R

The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by the American Geophysical Union {{and can be}} found at: [URL] core records show atmospheric methane mixing ratio and interpolar gradient varying with climate. Changes in wetland sources have been implicated as the basis for this observed variation in the record, but more recently, modeling studies suggest that changes in the CH₄ sink resulting from changes in sea surface temperature (SST) and emissions of other volatile organic carbon (VOC) <b>compounds</b> by <b>vegetation</b> must also be considered. We use the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) General Circulation Model (GCM) with the GISS Tropospheric Chemistry Model to study the response of the methane mixing ratio to source changes during the Holocene and also to a changing chemical sink during glacial-interglacial transitions. We combine model results with ice core data to demonstrate a method that provides constraints on changes in northern and tropical methane sources. Results show that within the Holocene, changes in the atmospheric methane mixing ratio and latitudinal gradient are not linear with respect to changing methane emissions. Tropical and northern emissions varied from preindustrial levels by as much as 38 % and 15 %, respectively, within the Holocene. At glacial-interglacial transitions the methane mixing ratio is sensitive to changes in both VOC and tropical methane emissions and the sensitivity also depends strongly on the assumed SST shift. Our findings suggest that changes in the ice core methane record are likely the result of changes in both the source and the sink. Changes in the sink become especially important when changes in methane mixing ratio and/or climate are large...|$|R

Other goals have been to exchange knowledge between Chinese and Norwegian scientists, as well as visiting research sites in highly polluted areas in China and evaluating their need of support in a future collaborative monitoring and research program. Besides doing field measurements, we have collected samples at more than 20 sites in three areas in China, i. e. Chongqing, Guiyang and Guangzhou.

Our survey documents negative effects of air pollution on all ecosystem levels investigated. The air concentration of sulfur in the urban and nearby areas is very high. The concentration of volatile organic compounds is generally high, which means that intcreased NOx emissions in coming years may create increasing O 3 problems. Reduced photosynthetic activity in some plants is documented, as well as soil and surface water acidification. Aquatic biota also reflects the acidification status of the surface waters investigated. However, the degree of damage in these regions is difficult to assess, since too few sites are incorporated in the survey. Surface water acidification is currently not a major enviromental problem in China and will presumably not become one during the next decades.

However, the combined effects of drought conditions on the emissions of biogenic volatile organic <b>compounds</b> (BVOC) from <b>vegetation</b> are uncertain due to contradictory responses to the individual drought components. While increased temperature causes an increase in emissions, for instance, low enough soil moisture causes a decrease. This study therefore explored the impacts of variations in individual climate conditions on BVOC emissions. The sensitivity of BVOC emissions to leaf area index (LAI), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), temperature, and precipitation were assessed using both ground measurements and the model MEGAN. While variations in PAR and LAI were less important than temperature in explaining variation in BVOC emissions, the choice of input data proved important. Satellite PAR produced lower isoprene emissions estimates than PAR generated by the meteorological model WRF. Higher resolution LAI data produced more spatial variability in isoprene emissions estimates. Drought was not found to correspond well to BVOC emissions, with temperature providing a much better predictor of emissions at a given location...|$|R

40|$|Global {{climate models}} {{simulate}} the Earth's climate impressively at scales of continents and greater. At these scales, large-scale dynamics and physics largely define the climate. At spatial scales relevant to policy makers, and to impacts and adaptation, many other processes may affect {{regional and local}} climate and perhaps trigger teleconnections that provide significant feedbacks on the global climate. These processes include fire, irrigation, land cover change (including crops and urban landscapes), and the emissions of biogenic volatile organic <b>compounds</b> by <b>vegetation.</b> Many of these interact within the atmosphere via dynamical, physical, and chemical mechanisms that lead to boundary-layer feedbacks. It is unlikely {{that any of these}} processes have a significant global-scale impact on the Earth's climate {{in the sense that the}} amount of warming due to a doubling of well mixed greenhouse gases would change if these processes were explicitly represented in climate models. These phenomena are usually local in space (e. g. urban) or in time (e. g. fire) and probably do not provide the on-going and sustained forcing to affect the global climate. However, for most impacts and adaptation research it is the regional and local climate that defines climate risk. At these scales, processes missing in climate models can have a substantially larger local-scale impact than the additional radiative forcing due to increasing greenhouse gases. Thus, while climate models are well designed for global and continental scales they exclude a suite of important processes that are locally and/or regionally important. We review these missing processes and highlight the research required to resolve the representation of these regional-scale processes in climate models. We also discuss the experimental methodology required to rigorously determine whether these processes are restricted to a local or regional-scale role or whether they do trigger robust teleconnections that would demonstrate global-scale significanc...|$|R

Yet, research on the biogeochemical cycle of Si in ecosystems is hampered by the time and cost associated with the currently used chemical analysis methods. Here, we assessed the suitability of Near Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy (NIRS) for measuring Si content in plant tissues. NIR spectra depend on the characteristics of the present bonds between H and N, C and O, which can be calibrated against concentrations of various compounds. Because Si in plants always occurs as hydrated condensates of orthosilicic acid (Si(OH) 4), linked to organic biomolecules, we hypothesized that NIRS is suitable for measuring Si content in plants across a range of plant species. We based our testing on 442 samples of 29 plant species belonging to a range of growth forms. We calibrated the NIRS method against a well-established plant Si analysis method by using partial least-squares regression. Si concentrations ranged from detection limit (0. 24 ppmSi) to 7. 8 % Si on dry weight and were well predicted by NIRS. The model fit with validation data was good across all plant species (n= 141, R 2 = 0. 90, RMSEP= 0. 24), but improved when only graminoids were modeled (n= 66, R 2 = 0. 95, RMSEP= 0. 10). A species specific model for the grass Deschampsia cespitosa showed even slightly better results than the model for all graminoids (n= 16, R 2 = 0. 93, RMSEP= 0. 015). We show for the first time that NIRS is applicable for determining plant Si concentration across a range of plant species and growth forms, and represents a time- and cost-effective alternative to the chemical Si analysis methods. As NIRS can be applied concurrently to a range of plant organic constituents, it opens up unprecedented research possibilities for studying interrelations between Si and other plant <b>compounds</b> in <b>vegetation,</b> and for addressing the role of Si in ecosystems across a range of Si research domains...|$|R

Emission rates of such compounds depend critically on the plant species. Future land use change, driven by the cultivation of biofuel feedstocks, will change the distribution of plant species and hence the magnitude and distribution of emissions. Here we use relationships between biomass yield and isoprene emissions derived from experimental data for 29 commercially available poplar hybrids to assess the impact that the large-scale cultivation of poplar for use as a biofuel feedstock will have on air quality in Europe. We show that the increases in ground-level ozone across Europe will increase the number of premature deaths attributable to ozone pollution each year by up to 6 %. Substantial crop losses (up to ~ 9 Mt y- 1 of wheat and maize) are also projected. We further demonstrate that these impacts are strongly dependent on the location of the poplar plantations, due to the prevailing meteorology, the population density and the dominant crop type of the region.

However, the maximum water layer thicknesses obtained for the dried leaves were much lower (8. 8 - 17. 9 m). We postulate that the cuticular membrane may behave as a ''valve'' between the inner and outer region of the leaf and that its permeability is controlled by the relative humidity of the air.

A compound's location on or within leaves will affect its persistence and significance; retention in surface compartments (i. e., the epicuticular wax and cuticle) renders the compound more susceptible to photodegradation and volatilization, while penetration into the epidermal cell walls or cytoplasm will enhance susceptibility to metabolism. Here, for the first time, methodologies which combine plant and PAH autofluorescence with two-photon excitation microscopy (TPEM) are used to visualize and quantify compound photodegradation on and within living plant leaves. Anthracene, fluoranthene, and phenanthrene were introduced to living leaves of Zea mays and monitored in real time, in control treatments, and when subject to UV-A radiation. Compound photodegradation was observed directly; different degradation rates occurred for different compounds (anthracene > fluoranthene > phenanthrene) and in different locations (at the leaf surface > within the epidermal cells). Results suggest that photodegradation on vegetation may be a more important loss mechanism for PAHs than previously thought. <b>Compound</b> fate in <b>vegetation</b> is potentially highly complex, influenced by diffusion into and location within leaf structures, the rates of supply/loss with the atmosphere, exposure to sunlight, and other environmental conditions. The techniques described here provide a real-time tool to advance insight into these issues...|$|R
40|$|A new {{facility}} {{has been developed}} to investigate the formation of new particles from the oxidation of volatile organic <b>compounds</b> emitted from <b>vegetation.</b> The facility consists of a biogenic emissions enclosure, an aerosol growth chamber, and the associated instrumentation. Using the facility, new particle formation events have been induced through the reaction of ozone with three different precursor gas mixtures: an α-pinene test mixture and the emissions of a Holm oak (Quercus ilex) specimen and a loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) specimen. The results demonstrate the variability between species in their potential to form new aerosol products. The emissions of Q.  ilex specimen resulted in fewer particles than did α-pinene, although the concentration of monoterpenes was roughly equal in both experiments before the addition of ozone. Conversely, the oxidation of P.  taeda specimen emissions {{led to the formation}} of more particles than either of the other two gas mixtures, despite a lower initial terpenoid concentration. These variations can be attributed to differences in the speciation of the vegetative emissions with respect to the α-pinene mixture and to each other. Specifically, the presence of β-pinene and other slower-reacting monoterpenes probably inhibited particle formation in the Q.  ilex experiment, while the presence of sesquiterpenes, including β-caryophyllene, in the emissions of the P.  taeda specimen were the likely cause of the more intense particle formation events observed during that experiment...|$|R
40|$|At the end {{of summer}} 1955 I found in two stands in Kotor, near the road leading to the village of Muo and in the {{immediate}} vicinity of hotel Slavia, the annual grass Eleusine indica Gaertn. In the autumn of the same year I herborized the plant in Kaldanija near Umag, while Professor S. Horvatic found this very interesting species in the city of Piran. In all the three stands the plant grows in composition with nitrophile <b>vegetation.</b> The <b>compound</b> of that <b>vegetation</b> is represented by two phytocoenological records. The discovery of this tropical plant is highly interesting, the more so since it has probably been unknown so far in the flora of Jugoslavia. Comparing the stands reported by Pospichal (1897 : 52), Ascherson and Graebner (1898 — 1902 : 90), Fritsch (1922 : 685) and Fiori (1923 — 1925 : 114) we [nay conclude that they refer to areas outside Jugoslavia, A comparison of Hayek’s report (1933 : 360), which states that in Macedonia this grass is adventitious, with all other reports concerning the southern part of Yugoslavia, suggests the conclusion that his report refers to Aegean Macedonia (Greece). If this is so, then the presence of the species Eleusine indica Gaertn. in localities in Istria and Boka Kotorska may be regarded as findings of a new genus in the flora of Yugoslavia...|$|R
40|$|Programs {{to plant}} {{millions}} {{of trees in}} cities around the world aim at the reduction of summer temperatures, increase carbon storage, storm water control, provision of space for recreation, as well as poverty alleviation. Although these multiple benefits speak positively for urban greening programs, the programs do {{not take into account}} how close human and natural systems are coupled in urban areas. Elevated temperatures together with anthropogenic emissions of air and water pollutants distinguish the urban system. Urban and sub-urban vegetation responds to ambient changes and reacts with pollutants. Neglecting this coupling may lead to unforeseen drawbacks of urban greening programs. The potential for emissions of volatile organic <b>compounds</b> (VOC) from <b>vegetation</b> combined with anthropogenic emissions to produce ozone has long been recognized. This potential increases under rising temperatures. Here we investigate how heat waves affect emissions of VOC from urban vegetation and corresponding ground-level ozone. In this study we use Weather Research and Forecasting Model with coupled atmospheric chemistry (WRF-CHEM) to quantify these feedbacks in Berlin, Germany during the 2006 heat wave. VOC emissions from vegetation are simulated with MEGAN 2. 0 coupled with WRF-CHEM. Our preliminary results indicate that contribution of VOCs from vegetation to ozone formation may increase by more than twofold during the heat wave period. We highlight the importance of the vegetation for urban areas under changing climate and discuss associated tradeoffs...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{urbanization}} {{and economic}} development in East Asia in past decades has led to photochemical air pollution problems such as excess photochemical ozone and aerosol formation. Asian megacities such as Seoul, Tokyo, Shanghai, Gangzhou, and Beijing are surrounded by densely forested areas and recent research has consistently demonstrated the importance of biogenic volatile organic <b>compounds</b> from <b>vegetation</b> in determining oxidation capacity in the suburban Asian megacity regions. Uncertainties in constraining tropospheric oxidation capacity, dominated by hydroxyl radical concentrations, undermine our ability to assess regional photochemical air pollution problems. We present an observational dataset of CO, NO x, SO 2, ozone, HONO, and VOCs (anthropogenic and biogenic) from Taehwa Research Forest (TRF) near the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA) in early June 2012. The data show that TRF is influenced both by aged pollution and fresh BVOC emissions. With the dataset, we diagnose HO x (OH, HO 2, and RO 2) distributions calculated with the University of Washington Chemical Box Model (UWCM v 2. 1). Uncertainty from unconstrained HONO sources and radical recycling processes highlighted in recent studies is examined using multiple model simulations with different model constraints. The results suggest that (1) different model simulation scenarios cause systematic differences in HO x distributions especially OH levels (up to 2. 5 times) and (2) radical destruction (HO 2 +HO 2 or HO 2 +RO 2) could be more efficient than radical recycling (HO 2 +NO) especially in the afternoon. Implications of the uncertainties in radical chemistry are discussed with respect to ozone-VOC-NO x sensitivity and oxidation product formation rates. Overall, the VOC limited regime in ozone photochemistry is predicted but the degree of sensitivity can significantly {{vary depending on the}} model scenarios. The model results also suggest that RO 2 levels are positively correlated with OVOCs production that is not routinely constrained by observations. These unconstrained OVOCs can cause higher than expected OH loss rates (missing OH reactivity) and secondary organic aerosol formation. The series of modeling experiments constrained by observations strongly urge observational constraint of the radical pool to enable precise understanding of regional photochemical pollution problems in the East Asian megacity region...|$|R
40|$|In a wild fire, organic {{volatile}} <b>compounds</b> from <b>vegetation</b> condense on {{soil particles}} forming a hydrophobic layer several centimeters below the soil surface. We studied {{the degradation of}} the hydrophobic layer in soils from two fire sites. One site {{is located in a}} montane woodland (Wood Camp, Logan Canyon, UT) that burned in 2006. The second site is located in an arid pinyon pine/juniper stand in Milford Flats, Beaver County, UT that burned in 2007. Both sites were sampled in 2008. In situ measurements of hydrophobicity demonstrated highly hydrophobic layers a few centimeters below the surface at both sites in contrast with unburned control sites, where hydrophobicity was observed at the surface but fell off sharply with depth. Samples of surface and subsurface soil were collected from the burned and unburned areas at both sites. Subsamples of all the soils were placed in microlysimeters, treated with acid snowmelt, elevated temperatures (30 °C - 47 °C), and UV light. After the treatments, the soils were air-dried and the surfaces analyzed for evidence of change in hydrophobicity using the drop test, oxidation of aromatic functional groups by cation exchange capacity (CEC), and the selective degradation of aliphatic functional groups associated with hydrophobicity by FTIR-ATR. Although results of the water drop penetration test suggest that simply wetting and air-drying the soils resulted in complete loss of hydrophobicity, the CEC results suggest that carbon oxidation occurred in the organic matter rich Wood Camp Soils. CEC results for the low carbon content Milford Flats soils were less clear. Analyses of peak heights in the range 4000 - 400 cm- 1 demonstrate clear differences between the controlled and burned soils from the two sites and effects of all the treatments, particularly in the regions from 3020 to 2800 cm- 1, corresponding to asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of methyl and methylene groups associated with hydrophobicity. Peak height in this range decreased for both the burned soils exposed to natural UV light relative to covered soils. Slightly elevating temperature within an environmentally relevant range decreased peak heights in both the control and burned soils. Changes in peaks associated with polysaccharides (1030 cm- 1) and CO 2 (2260 cm- 1) suggest microbial activity as a factor...|$|R
40|$|The {{interactions}} between the atmosphere and the biosphere have been studied {{to a great extent}} in the last decades; it cannot be denied that these systems are altering each other’s processes. The production of terpenoid <b>compounds</b> by <b>vegetation</b> is an example of such interactions. Ecological and atmospheric scientists are interested in the production and emission of terpenoid compounds. However, they are studying them from substantially different points of view, driven largely by the scales at which they approach the process. The aim of my dissertation was to study biogenic emissions and their effect on atmospheric chemistry using variables such as landscape structure, landscape configuration, and developmental stage; factors that have not been considered before from an atmospheric point of view. The main questions of my study were: (1) Does understory vegetation have an impact on regional emissions? (2) Does developmental stage affect terpenoid emissions? (3) Does the light environment in the forest affect the rate at which terpenoid compounds are emitted? To answer these questions, field studies were performed and terpenoid emissions were measured using branch enclosure measurements and GC-MS techniques. The first question was assessed by using Pteridium aquilinum, one of the most abundant understory species. We determined that Pteridium was a terpenoid emitter, but its emissions did not influence the regional atmospheric chemistry. Nevertheless, this study is a first step to consider the herbaceous layer when studying monoterpene emissions. The second question studied the difference in emissions of Pinus ponderosa seedlings and mature trees, finding {{a significant difference in the}} magnitude of the emissions but not in their chemical composition; emissions of seedlings were greater. In this case, this study is one of the first on the developmental stage and monoterpene emissions in a woody species. The third question, addressing the differences of emissions of sun and shaded branches of Pinus ponderosa, found a significant difference between the branches’ emissions. The results of the different questions addressed in this work show that it is necessary to incorporate landscape component to have a better understanding of the production and effects of BVOC’s compounds in the atmosphere...|$|R
