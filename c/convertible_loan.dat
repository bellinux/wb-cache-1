5|$|Although the IFC's {{shareholders}} initially {{only allowed}} it to make loans, the IFC was authorized in 1961 to make equity investments, {{the first of which}} was made in 1962 by taking a stake in FEMSA, a former manufacturer of auto parts in Spain that is now part of Bosch Spain. The IFC invests in businesses' equity either directly or via private equity funds, generally from five up to twenty percent of a company's total equity. IFC’s private equity portfolio currently stands at roughly $3.0 billion committed to about 180 funds. The portfolio is widely distributed across all regions including Africa, East Asia, South Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Middle East, and recently has invested in Small Enterprise Assistance Funds' (SEAF) Caucasus Growth Fund, Aureos Capital's Kula Fund II (Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Pacific Islands) and Leopard Capital’s Haiti Fund. Other equity investments made by the IFC include preferred equity, <b>convertible</b> <b>loans,</b> and participation loans. The IFC prefers to invest for the long-term, usually for a period of eight to fifteen years, before exiting through the sale of shares on a domestic stock exchange, usually as part of an initial public offering.

40|$|Recapitalization {{has been}} a world phenomenon, with the major aim being to {{strengthen}} the banking system for effective monetary management. Banking sectorâ€™s asset and liability discrepancy as well as general instability of the banking sector resulted in the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) increasing capital requirements from USD 12. 5 to USD 100 million. It is against this background that the research seeks to ascertain the reasons behind an increase in capital requirements by Central Bank, the recapitalization strategies being pursued by the commercial banking sector in Zimbabwe and their effectiveness. The issue of recapitalization {{happens to be a}} hot issue at Board and top management level and it is hoped that this research may provide a good insight into the possible solutions enabling commercial banks to meet capital requirements. Literature review explores the reasons behind an increase in capital requirements, the challenges facing commercial banks and the recapitalization strategies being implemented. Literature was premised on the work of Yin (1994), where eeffective implementations of recapitalisation strategies is seen as a variable dependent on the independent variables of choice of rights issue, new shares issue, mergers, acquisitions, retained earnings, capital subsidy and loan stock and <b>convertible</b> <b>loan</b> stock as recapitalization strategies. In an attempt to involve an examination of perceptions in order to gain an understanding of social and human activities the interpretive research philosophy was adopted. In addition and for the purposes of collecting original data to describe a population and enable measurement of attitudes and orientations in a large population, a descriptive survey design was deemed relevant for this research. The population covered the 16 major players in the commercial banking sector who are represented in the capital city Harare. Stratified random sampling and purposive sampling methods were used in the selection of top management, board members of banks and Reserve Bank personnel as respondents in this study. A sample of 25 respondents was chosen from a target population of 36. Interviews and a structured questionnaire were the principal research instruments for primary data. The study made use of industry journals, monetary policy statements, strategic reports of commercial banks to gather secondary data [...] It was revealed in the research that the major reasons behind recapitalization were; to reduce possibility of bank failures, beef up inadequate capital base, curb mismanagement of funds, control, unfair competition, protection of depositorsâ€™ funds and ultimately improve the efficiency of banks. The research established that banks were recapitalizing through strategies of; new shares issue, convertible stock, retained earnings, merger, acquisitions and rights issue. These the existing recapitalization strategies were seen as effective because majority of banks have been able to comply. Further recommendations are that banks should consider further strategies in the form of mergers, acquisitions, external capital, and diversification. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{investment}} into an ARM-backed security {{requires the}} estimation of its theoretical, “fair”, value, which can be determined using a stochastic valuation model and a well-specified prepayment function. In this study, we develop a general framework for the valuation of ARM-backed securities, based on the two-factor Heath, Jarrow and Morton (HJM) (1992) term structure model and non-linear prepayment functions. The HJM specification is well suited for the valuation of ARM-backed securities, for it allows to explicitly model both short-term and long-term interest rates. Prepayment function is estimated by the Cox proportional hazards model and the spline technique. We further demonstrate how the price of an ARM-backed security {{is affected by the}} choice of the prepayment model. ARM-backed securities are then priced by the method of Monte Carlo simulation. We find that the Cox proportional hazards model outperforms the spline technique. The investment value of a convertible ARM-backed security is also influenced by the short position that an investor takes in the embedded conversion option. To value the conversion option, we estimate a prepayment function for convertible mortgage pools. The theoretical value of the conversion option is calculated as the difference in model prices of non-convertible and convertible ARM-backed securities. We further investigate the sensitivity of the conversion option value to ARM contractual features and the interest rate related factors. We show that the conversion option reduces the value of an ARM-backed security to an investor because <b>convertible</b> <b>loans</b> exhibit prepayment rates which are faster and more sensitive to the interest rate fluctuations than those for non-convertible loans. ...|$|R

40|$|Firms {{raise their}} capital via the common {{external}} funds either debt or equity. However, under certain conditions, firms {{are required to}} issue more complex financial engineering instruments namely hybrid securities. Literatures showed that very little {{studies have been conducted}} on Islamic Capital Market and in establishing the determinants of hybrid securities. Based on theories of capital structure which related to non hybrid capital structure, the variables and the models on hybrid financing are developed. In further filling the gap of the preceding studies, we developed a dynamic model by incorporating important variables that are associated to macroeconomic indicators that are economic growth (GDP), interest rate (BFR), level of stock market development and bond market development. Several estimation models are developed namely <b>convertible</b> bond plus <b>loan</b> stock which signify for debt treat hybrid (model 1) and warrant which is represent equity treat hybrid (model 2) respectively. This study employs the static model via panel ordinary least square (OLS), fixed effects model and random effects model to identify the best estimation model. Besides that, the study also include dynamic model via General Method of Moment (GMM) - first and second generation GMM, to get the most excellent model. From the analysis of static model, it reveals that the best estimation models for both hybrid securities are from model 1 and 2 of fixed effect model. Meanwhile from dynamic analysis, system GMM is considered the most excellent model. As inferences to the body of knowledge, this research has established several factors that are significant in determining hybrid securities for both debt and equity feature hybrid respectively. For Model 1, risk and profitability is considered the most determinant considerations for issuing <b>convertible</b> bond and <b>loan</b> stock in conjunction with its highest coefficient among all the variables under review. Meanwhile for Model 2, financial risk and adverse financial position is the most determinant factors for issuing hybrid equity. These results suggest that, the firms that expose with high risk but low profitable position will opt for warrant for expansion and the firms that have high risk and strong financial position will choose <b>convertible</b> bond or <b>loan</b> stock. Since the high risk firms but profitable are difficult to secure additional credit facility from the financial institutions, there always opt for hybrid security of convertible bond as proposed by risk shifting theory where hybrid securities allow the high risk firm to further venture into riskier business. For high risk but adverse financial position will opt for warrant securities. Meanwhile, the result from model 1 also support the sequential financial problem theory where the hybrid securities enable the profitable firms to venture intopositive NPV project by issuing convertible bond as it offer lower coupon rate as compare to the normal debt rate. These findings can be considered as indication that firms generally use hybrid securities implied by sequential financial problem theory and risk shifting in addition to other capital structure theories such as trade off, pecking order and back door listing...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} design of the control rights and the {{maturity}} of securities when management has the ability to divert or manipulate the cash flows, and when it is prohibitively costly for a third party, such as court, to verify or prove any managerial wrongdoing. By endogenizing claim structures, control rights and maturity, I derive a diverse set of optimal contracts. Debt with a maturity shorter than the life of the assets is sustainable when investors have the contingent right to liquidate the firm's assets. Long-term debt can be sustained by investors' right to dismiss management and take over the firm as a going-concern {{in the event of a}} default. Investors are willing to hold indefinite life equity if they are granted either the unconditional right to liquidate firm's assets or the unconditional right to dismiss management. Finally, convertible debt can be sustained by investors' right to dismiss management and take over the firm in the event of default by the holder's option to convert their debt contract to an equity contract prior to its expiration date. Consistent with empirical evidence, this model predicts that small entrepreneurial firms use short term bank <b>loans,</b> <b>convertible</b> debt, or outside equity at their initial financing stage; as they show evidence of higher profitability, they can secure longer-term financing. ...|$|R

40|$|Kari Lautjärvi MEZZANINE FINANCE INSTRUMENTS - A COMPANY LAW STUDY ON THE DEBT BASED MEZZANINE INSTRUMENT HOLDER´S LEGAL POSITION IN A FINNISH COMPANY LIMITED BY SHARES 1. Object {{and methods}} of the {{dissertation}} This doctoral dissertation provides a comprehensive discussion on various equity and debt financing instruments that Finnish limited liability companies (limited by shares) generally use. The main focus of the dissertation is examining mezzanine debt instruments incorporating such things as control covenants, capital and debenture loans, perpetual hybrid loans, profit sharing loans as well as <b>convertible</b> and option <b>loans.</b> In general, mezzanine finance instruments are used as corporate finance products in Finland and are a form of hybrid capital. Albeit typically structured as debt instruments, mezzanine instruments are often more akin to equity finance instruments {{by virtue of their}} characteristics. The equity instruments are regulated mainly by company law as well as the articles of association of the company concerned, whilst the debt instruments are regulated in essence by the Law of Obligations and the general principles of contract law. The new Finnish Act on Limited Liability Companies (624 / 2006), hereinafter the "FCA", extended the contractual freedom of companies in creating different types of equity financing instruments, primarily by the creation of different classes of shares. The equity instruments may confer preferred voting, economic rights and other benefits as well as redeemable and convertible rights. Conversely, the contract law principle of freedom of contract has traditionally enabled the debt instruments to be tailored according to the needs of a particular company. Consequently, there is extensive contractual freedom in creating mezzanine debt instruments in Finland. Finnish limited liability companies issue mezzanine instruments primarily for the purposes of achieving tax benefits, improving the company´s solvency and credit ratios as well as facilitating the company´s capital funding or decreasing capital expenditure. The mezzanine instruments may, inter alia, contribute to the improvement of risk management for companies and their investors as well as increased profits for the investors. They also provide an alternative financing method for companies, their shareholders and other investors by mitigating their conflicting interests. The implementation of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in Finland has emphasized substance based evaluation in defining the difference between equity and debt in company accounts. Thus, the actual substance and nature of the instrument concerned is important more often than its legal form. However, from the perspectives of the Finnish company, accounting and tax law, the legal character and status of equity and debt instruments may differ or conflict with one another. This dissertation mainly concentrates on the analysis of various types of mezzanine instruments and the structure of the applicable Finnish legal rules. The central theme of the dissertation is the study of the principal-agent theory combined with the theory of transaction cost economics. The dissertation considers both the protection granted by the FCA as well as the risks involved for the various actors in a company. Therefore, {{the focus is on the}} factual nature and content of the financial instruments rather than their pure legal form. The analysis in the dissertation also encompasses the theory of law and economics. The Finnish legislation, legal literature and case law directly addressing debt-based mezzanine instruments are modest, and the same applies to the other Nordic legal systems. Consequently, the dissertation also contains comparative research on certain legal aspects of EU regulations and Anglo-American rules. 2. Themes, structure and conclusions of the dissertation The dissertation discusses the legal position under the FCA of a contractual creditor at a general level, and particularly the position of a debt- based mezzanine instrument holder in a Finnish limited liability company where the company is a going concern. As a general theme, the dissertation suggests that a contractual creditor of a company could, under certain circumstances, be identified as a principal of the company's management, while the board of directors in particular acts as the agent. This suggestion is highlighted especially in circumstances where the creditor is the holder of a mezzanine debt instrument conferring control or residual rights, or the instrument is perpetual by nature. A specific theme of the dissertation is the fiduciary duties of the management (the board of directors), particularly the duty of care and the duty of loyalty owed to a contractual creditor under Section 8 of Chapter 1 of the FCA. These duties have been traditionally interpreted as extending to both the company (directly) and its shareholders (indirectly). The fulfillment of the directors´ duty of care with regard to particular acts and omissions is determined by the rule of business judgment. The dissertation consists of nine Chapters. Chapter 1 describes the object, themes, theoretical frames, methods, structure and sources of the dissertation. Chapter 2 focuses on the roles of both equity-based and debt-based investors and their relevant principal-agent relations in the mezzanine financing transactions. The chapter examines, inter alia, various theories concerning a company and the shareholders or stakeholders of a company in these contexts, the regulatory frameworks and legal strategies for protecting principals, and the protection granted by the FCA for principals in various principal-agent relations. Chapter 3 provides an overview of the capital structure in a Finnish limited liability company, the characteristics of both equity and debt, equity and debt investments as a combination of risk and income, the risk preferences of various investors, the legal positions of various investors in relation to an order for distribution of payments or return of capital, and the relevance of the risk positions. In addition, the chapter discusses equity and debt capital from the perspectives of the company, accounting, tax and insolvency laws. Furthermore, Chapter 3 describes the capital structure under the FCA, including the formation, maintenance and distribution rules of the equity capital, and the creditors´ protection regime. Chapter 4 addresses mezzanine capital from the perspectives of company, accounting, tax and insolvency laws. Chapter 5 examines the levels of regulation and regulatory instruments for various types of mezzanine finance. Chapter 6 describes the different types of equity-based and debt-based mezzanine instruments used by a Finnish limited liability company and discusses various reasons for the use of the appropriate mezzanine finance instruments. Chapter 7 examines the asymmetry of legal treatment of mezzanine finance instruments from the perspectives of the company, accounting, tax and insolvency Laws, and the problems resulted from this asymmetry. The chapter also illustrates the similarities and differences between a tailored equity- based and a tailored debt- based mezzanine finance instrument, namely, a preferred share without any voting and residual income rights which is redeemable by the company, and a hybrid loan instrument having elements of perpetuity. Chapter 8 is the core of the dissertation. It provides an extensive discussion on the legal position of a contractual creditor as a principal and the legal strategies for the protection of such a creditor in general and as derived from the management´s fiduciary duties under the FCA where the debtor company is a going concern. Chapter 8 examines particularly the issue as to whether the management´s fiduciary duties (i. e., the duties of care and loyalty) under the FCA could in certain circumstances be extended to protect a contractual creditor in general and especially a debt-based mezzanine instrument holder, where the instrument has been strengthened with conditions or covenants of control rights, residual income rights or conversion rights. The chapter also discusses the relevance of the contractual loyalty principle in this context. Furthermore, Chapter 8 examines the functioning of the creditors´ protection regime pursuant to the FCA, the clarity and transparency of the legal position of the debt- based mezzanine investor under the FCA as well as the availability and reliability of information related to various finance instruments. Chapter 9 summarizes the conclusions of the research de lege lata and proposes regulative improvements de lege ferenda. The dissertation concludes with the notion that the close connection between the purpose of the company´s activities (normally long-term profit maximization of the shareholders of the company) with the going-concern principle of company law, on the one hand, and the duties of care and loyalty of the company´s management on the other, together result in the extension of the protection afforded under these fiduciary duties to contractual creditors (indirectly). This protection extends to the contractual creditors, especially when management´s decision on the distribution (and use) of company´s funds may affect the company´s liquidity and solvency, particularly in evaluating the company´s liquidity under the FCA. These fiduciary duties of management are emphasized in relation to the holders of debt- based mezzanine instruments conferring residual or control rights at that time or in the future (derived from conversion rights). The dissertation proposes de lege ferenda legislative reforms to the FCA, such as the clarification of directly and indirectly protected actors with regard to the management´s duty of care and duty of loyalty, and reevaluation of the creditors´ protection regime (and particularly the liquidity and solvency test) in distribution and maintenance of|$|R
