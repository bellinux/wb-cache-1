40|$|Agrochemical spray {{formulations}} {{applied to}} plants are often mixed with surfactants that facilitate {{delivery of the}} active ingredient. However, surfactants cause phytotoxicity and off-target effects in the environment. We propose the use of nanostructured liquid crystalline particles (NLCP) {{as an alternative to}} surfactant-based agrochemical delivery. For this, we have compared the application of commercial surfactants, di (2 -ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate and <b>alkyl</b> <b>dimethyl</b> <b>betaine,</b> with NLCP made from phytantriol, at concentrations of 0. 1 %, 1 % and 5 % on the adaxial surface of leaves of four plant species Ttriticum aestivum (wheat), Zea mays (maize), Lupinus angustifolius (lupin), and Arabidopsis thaliana. In comparison with the application of surfactants there was less phytotoxicity on leaves of each species following treatment with NLCP. Following treatment of leaves with NLCP analysis of cuticular wax micromorphology revealed less wax solubilization in the monocot species. The results clearly show that there are advantages in the use of NLCP rather than surfactants for agrochemical delivery...|$|R

This is inspired by prior works that utilize BS- 12 as bio mineralization catalyst in the synthesis of CSCaCO 3 NPs that can easily be manipulated for bio-applications, cost efficient, and relatively pure nanoparticles [30]. The morphology and size of synthesized nanoparticles are crucial in determining their physicochemical properties, with focus on metal nanoparticles given their vast potential biomedical applications [31]. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have continuously been used due to their optical properties, different size range, and color which are dependent on absorption maxima variations or the synthesis method employed [32]. AuNPs’ size and shape affect their absorption and emission characteristics in the light visible spectrum, making them vary from visible to near infrared regions. Therefore, due to their synthesis [33], physicochemical properties [34], biocompatibility [35], and surface functionalization [36], they can be manipulated for different and particular applications [37].

The cockle shell-based calcium carbonate aragonite nanoparticle with functionalized surface was characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), particle size distribution, pH measurement analysis, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Surface functionalization was proven to improve the overall size and shape of the nanoparticles and enhance their dispersion properties, preventing coarse agglomeration among nanoparticles in general. The improved method was verified to retain its aragonite crystalline nature. Additionally, surface functionalization did not increase the size of nanoparticles throughout the modification process. This facile preparation using naturally occurring cockle shells as the main source is environmentally friendly because it provides relatively low cost of raw material source as it is abundantly available in nature and has good mineral purity content.

Gram-negative test organisms developed higher resistance to both the ADEBAC and the ADBAC compounds. The gram-positive bacteria {{were found to be}} more susceptible to the action of these compounds. The higher lipid content of the gram-negative bacteria appears {{to play a role in}} protecting these organisms against the injurious effects of the quaternary ammonium compounds. Quaternary ammonium resistant strains of the test organisms were found to contain more fat bodies per cell than the sensitive strains when stained with Sudan black B. The ADEBAC sensitive and the ADEBAC resistant strains of the following gram-negative test organisms were used for comparative tests: A. aerogenes 12658, A. metalcaligenes, E. coli 198, P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa, P. fluorescens MI, P. fragi, P. saliciperda, P. syringae, and S. marcescens. It was found that the growth temperature had an effect on pigment production in the case of the ADEBAC sensitive strains of S. marcescens. The test organism failed to produce its characteristic pink pigment when incubated at 37 °C., a temperature above its optimum. It is postulated that the higher growth temperature has an effect on the cells' enzymatic composition. No differences were observed among the ADEBAC sensitive and the ADEBAC resistant strains of the test organisms with regard to motility and growth patterns on TGY agar slants and in nutrient broth. The ADEBAC apparently had an inhibitory effect on gelatinase, nitratase, tryptophanase and various carbohydrase enzymes of the ADEBAC resistant strains. From the results obtained in this study, it may be concluded that gram-negative bacteria are more resistant, and the gram-positive bacteria more susceptible to quaternary ammonium compounds; and that the quaternary ammonium compounds have an inhibitory effect on certain bacterial enzymes. Furthermore, quaternary ammonium germicides may alter lipid metabolism of cells as they become resistant and this change may eventually be seen as involved in the mechanism of resistance...|$|R
50|$|Benzalkonium {{chloride}} degradation follows consecutive debenzylation, dealkylation, and demethylation steps producing benzyl chloride, <b>alkyl</b> <b>dimethyl</b> amine, dimethyl amine, long chain alkane, and ammonia. The intermediates, major, {{and minor}} products {{can then be}} broken down into CO2, H2O, NH3, and Cl-. The first step to the biodegradation of BAC is the fission or splitting of the alkyl chain from the quaternary nitrogen as shown in the diagram. This is done by abstracting the hydrogen from the alkyl chain by using a hydroxyl radical leading to a carbon centered radical. This results in benzyl dimethyl amine as the first intermediate and dodecanal as the major product. From here, benzyl dimethyl amine can be oxidized to benzoic acid using the Fenton process. The trimethyl amine group in dimethylbenzylamine can be cleaved to form a benzyl that can be further oxidized to benzoic acid. Benzoic acid uses hydroxylation (adding a hydroxyl group) to form p-hydroxybenzoic acid. Benzyldimethylamine can then be converted into ammonia by performing demethylation twice, which removes both methyl groups, followed by debenzylation, removing the benzyl group using hydrogenation. The diagram represents suggested pathways of the biodegradation of BAC for both the hydrophobic and the hydrophilic regions of the surfactant. Since Stearalkonium chloride is a type of BAC, the biodegradation process should happen in the same manner.|$|R

This paper describes, {{on the basis of}} an in-situ pilot scale study, the evolution of roof runoff contamination over a one year period following the biocide treatment of roof frames. Results show a major contamination of roof runoff immediately after treatment (from 5 to 30 mg/L), followed by an exponential decrease. 175 - 375 mm of cumulated rainfall is needed before the runoff concentrations become less than EC 50 values for fish (280 mu g/l). The residual concentration in the runoff water remains above 4 mu g/L even after 640 mm of rainfall. The level of benzalkonium ions leaching depends on the roofing material, with lower concentrations and total mass leached from ceramic tiles than from concrete tiles, and {{on the state of the}} tile (new or worn out). Mass balance calculations indicate that a large part of the mass of benzalkonium compounds applied to the tiles is lost, probably due to biodegradation processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{microstructure}} of organoclays after organic surfactant modifications and the potential use in geoenvironmental engineering applications including waste containment in earthen barrier, rheological control agents for drilling fluid and soil stabilization. Organoclays, or clays modified by organic matters, are often synthesized by exchanging the naturally occurring interlayer inorganic cations (e. g., Na+, Ca 2 +) of the clay with organic cationic surfactants. In this research, montmorillonites intercalated with two quaternary ammonium surfactants, hexadecyltrimethylammonium (HDTMA+) and bis (hydrogenated tallow <b>alkyl)</b> <b>dimethyl</b> ammonium were used as the representative organo-rich, partitioning clays. The laboratory characterization techniques including XRD, TEM and FT-IR were employed to examine the interactions between montmorillonite minerals, surfactants, and organic sorbates. The results of XRD and TEM showed the successive interlayer expansion of montmorillonite because of intercalation of surfactants and hydrocarbons sorbates. The FT-IR results further confirmed {{the arrangement of the}} intercalated surfactant and the organic sorbates due to primary and secondary sorption. To understand the engineering behaviors of organoclays in earthen barriers, the free swelling and hydraulic conductivity tests were conducted to evaluate the permeability of compacted clay and geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) amended with HDTMA-organoclay. The results suggested that the addition of organoclay (less than 10 %) in compacted clay slightly increased the permeability of the mixture to water. However, due to the interaction between the organophilic phase in organoclays and non-polar liquids, low amounts of organoclay within the compacted clay admixture significantly decreased its permeability for non-polar liquids such as gasoline. Moreover, it was observed that low weight percentages of HDTMA-bentonite (up to 20 % by weight) had little or no impact on the hydraulic conductivity of the Na-bentonite or Ca-bentonite GCL. However, higher dosages of organoclay in GCLs could reduce the permeability to organic fluids such as gasoline. The impact of the amount of organoclay additives, pressure and temperature on the rheological behavior of organoclay/oil-based drilling fluids was investigated. The obtained results from XRD test suggested that the oil molecules entered the PM 199 interlayer, resulting in swelling and exfoliation of PM 199. It was observed that the viscosity of 5 % PM 199 suspension slightly decreased by increasing the temperature from 25 to 60 °C, and then the viscosity increased when the temperature raised from 60 to 150 °C. Moreover, {{it was found that the}} viscosity of 5 % PM 199 suspension increased when the pressure increased from 0 to 200 bar due to physical changes on both oil and organoclay particles. The effectiveness of organoclay and Portland cement for the solidification and stabilization (S/S) of contaminated soils was investigated in the laboratory. The results indicated that the addition of cement (5 % or 10 % by weight) reduced the hydraulic conductivity and increased the compressive strength of the solidification and stabilization soil specimens. Additionally, the leaching test results indicated that the addition of organoclay during solidification and stabilization significantly reduced the leaching of naphthalene and phenanthrene from the stabilized soil specimen. The results suggested that organoclay particles sorbed the organic contaminates and consequently reduced the naphthalene and phenanthrene leachate concentration. Also, it was observed that the naphthalene and phenanthrene leachate concentration decreased by increasing the curing time of S/S products. Overall, this study performed laboratory tests to obtain information regarding the microsturcture of cationic surfactant modifed bentonties and their engineering behaviors (e. g. hydrophobicity, swelling, permeability, stability in oil suspension). The obtained results are expected to yield significant insights into their potential applications as sorbents in hydraulic and sorptive barriers for organic compounds; rheological control additives in oil-based drilling fluid; agents for stabilization and solidification of contaminated soils...|$|R
40|$|The {{exponential}} amplification reaction (EXPAR) is {{an emerging}} isothermal nucleic acid amplification method with high potential for molecular diagnostics {{due to its}} isothermal nature and high amplification efficiency. However, the use of EXPAR {{is limited by the}} high levels of non-specific amplification. Hence, methods that can improve the specificity of EXPAR are desired to facilitate its widespread adoption in practice. Herein, we proposed a strategy to improve EXPAR performance by using molecular enhancers. Eight small molecules were investigated, including ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, <b>betaine,</b> <b>dimethyl</b> sulfoxide (DMSO), trehalose, tetramethylammonium chloride (TMAC), bovine serum albumin (BSA) and single-stranded binding (SSB) proteins. A combination of kinetic and end-point analysis was adopted to investigate how these molecules affected EXPAR performance. Trehalose, TMAC, BSA and SSB proteins were found to have positive effects on EXPAR with trehalose being able to increase the efficiency of EXPAR. In contrast, TMAC, BSA and SSB proteins were shown to increase the specificity of EXPAR. We applied our findings to demonstrate the combination of trehalose and TMAC could simultaneously improve both the efficiency and specificity of an EXPAR-based miRNA detection method. The information provided in this study may serve as a reference to benefit the wider isothermal amplification community...|$|R
