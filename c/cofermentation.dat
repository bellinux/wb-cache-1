30|$|The {{dilution}} of the retained solids after filtration of {{the mild}} slurry {{with the lower}} WIS content (11.1  wt %) was severely constrained by the required WIS load of 10  wt % in the SHCF. Hence, the retained solids were only diluted to a WIS load of 32  wt % in the enzymatic hydrolysis step. The enzymatic hydrolysis resulted in inferior hydrolysis because of various reasons associated with high WIS applications [35 – 37]. With inferior hydrolysis the lignocellulosic solids that remained in the enzymatic hydrolyzate were partially hydrolyzed and fermented simultaneously during the fed-batch <b>cofermentation</b> {{and the benefits of}} the preparatory hydrolysis of the unwashed solids waned. The simultaneous hydrolysis and <b>cofermentation</b> was undesirable in the SHCF, because the solids were partially hydrolyzed under suboptimal conditions at 30  °C during the fed-batch <b>cofermentation.</b> The drawback was not necessarily a lower yield given sufficient time, but that hydrolysis rate became a limiting factor for the fermentation rate. This constrained the final ethanol yield for the limited <b>cofermentation</b> period. An increase in temperature during the fed-batch <b>cofermentation</b> of the enzymatic hydrolyzate would have been needed to accommodate hydrolysis of remaining solids and avoid severe limitations to the fermentation rate. The illustrated limitation puts emphasis on the necessity of high sugar yields in preparatory enzymatic hydrolysis to implement the sequential targeting of xylose and glucose conversion with this strategy.|$|E

30|$|Agricultural residues, such as wheat straw, are {{feasible}} substrates {{for ethanol}} fermentation provided that pentoses and hexoses {{can be converted}} efficiently. Separate hydrolysis and <b>cofermentation</b> (SHCF) constitute a framework for improvement of conversion efficiency, because it permits independent optimization of the enzymatic hydrolysis and <b>cofermentation</b> steps. A drawback is that the high glucose concentrations present in SHCF repress xylose utilization and constrain ethanol yields. To improve xylose utilization the xylose-rich hydrolyzate liquor was separated from glucose-rich solids and the phases were cofermented sequentially. Prefermentation of the xylose-rich hydrolyzate liquor followed by fed-batch <b>cofermentation</b> of glucose-rich prehydrolyzed solids enabled sequential targeting of xylose and glucose conversion. The aim was to improve the xylose conversion by lowering the glucose repression of the xylose uptake. Various prefermentation configurations and feed patterns for prehydrolyzed solids were examined. Prefermentation increased ethanol yields overall, and fed-batch prefermentation reduced xylitol production. The best results were obtained by balancing promotion of efficient xylose conversion with maintained yeast viability. Fed-batch prefermentation and a single addition of prehydrolyzed solids, elicited an ethanol yield of 0.423  g·g− 1 and a xylitol yield of 0.036  g·g− 1.|$|E

30|$|Performing the enzymatic hydrolyses at high WIS loads {{imply the}} risk of lower sugar yields in hydrolysis.

However, inhibition primarily affects the hydrolysis rate— not the maximum conversion or yield—given sufficient time. Minor inefficiencies in the hydrolysis could be rectified with the employed <b>cofermentation</b> strategy, because the enzymes were carried over from the enzymatic hydrolysis to the subsequent <b>cofermentation</b> step, and provided an additional period of hydrolysis.

30|$|In this study, various SHCF-based <b>cofermentation</b> {{strategies}} for the conversion of glucose and xylose to ethanol were examined. Two wheat straw slurries with various inhibitor concentrations, prepared by dilute acid catalyzed steam-explosion, were used. The pentose-rich hydrolyzate liquor in the slurries was separated from the hexose-rich solids to enable sequential targeting of xylose and glucose conversion. <b>Cofermentation</b> was performed by a xylose-fermenting and inhibitor tolerant strain of S. cerevisiae in a 2 -step process, where prefermentation of the hydrolyzate liquor was followed by feeding of enzymatic hydrolysate, which consisted of prehydrolyzed unwashed solids. The hypothesis was that xylose could be converted with greater efficiency and render higher ethanol yields under the more favorable conditions for xylose conversion in the sequential fermentation steps than by conventional SHCF. Various feed patterns during prefermentation and for the addition of enzymatic hydrolyzate were examined to improve the xylose conversion and maximize the ethanol yield.|$|E
30|$|Comparison {{of overall}} <b>cofermentation</b> outcome between batch and fed-batch prefermentation of severe hydrolyzate liquor {{followed}} by two additions of enzymatic hydrolyzate (Fig.  3) exemplify the different consequences in a high inhibitor concentration context. Batch prefermentation followed by fed-batch <b>cofermentation</b> of enzymatic hydrolyzate elicited a xylose utilization of 71  % and an overall ethanol yield of 0.381  g·g− 1. In contrast, the corresponding strategy with fed-batch prefermentation resulted in low glucose conversion and, seemingly, no xylose consumption after fed-batch prefermentation of severe hydrolyzate liquor (Fig.  3 b). Fed-batch prefermentation supplied lower initial concentrations of inhibitors than batch prefermentation, but the continuous feed of hydrolyzate liquor seemingly exhausted the yeast. The continuous feed of inhibitors during fed-batch prefermentation exceeded the detoxification rate, {{which resulted in the}} accumulation of non-metabolized furaldehydes (data not shown). The furaldehydes were not fully converted during the sequent fed-batch <b>cofermentation</b> of enzymatic hydrolyzate. In contrast, the yeast was resilient to the higher initial inhibitor concentrations in batch prefermentation. The yeast was capable of promptly detoxifying the hydrolyzate liquor during batch prefermentation and after each addition of enzymatic hydrolyzate (data not shown). The decreased viability and fermentative capacity of the yeast was likely due to ceased growth and inhibitory effects [3]. The yeast cells were assumed to be particularly sensitive to exposure to inhibitors during the prefermentation of xylose-rich hydrolyzate liquor, because the conversion of xylose does not support growth efficiently [43].|$|E

Further, the hydrolyzate liquor was supplemented with glucose, corresponding to 81  % yield in enzymatic hydrolysis of the solid fraction. The supplemented hydrolyzate liquor mimicked the composition of enzymatically hydrolyzed slurry.

SRRC 2043, which accumulates the xanthone O-methylsterigmatocystin (OMST), a late precursor in the AFB 1 pathway, was observed to accumulate another chemically related compound (HOMST; molecular weight, 356); SRRC 163 is blocked early in the pathway and accumulates averantin.

40|$|The use {{of plant}} biomass for biofuel {{production}} will require efficient {{utilization of the}} sugars in lignocellulose, primarily glucose and xylose. However, strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae presently used in bioethanol production ferment glucose but not xylose. Yeasts engineered to ferment xylose do so slowly, and cannot utilize xylose until glucose is completely consumed. To overcome these bottlenecks, we engineered yeasts to coferment mixtures of xylose and cellobiose. In these yeast strains, hydrolysis of cellobiose takes place inside yeast cells through the action of an intracellular β-glucosidase following import by a high-affinity cellodextrin transporter. Intracellular hydrolysis of cellobiose minimizes glucose repression of xylose fermentation allowing coconsumption of cellobiose and xylose. The resulting yeast strains, cofermented cellobiose and xylose simultaneously and exhibited improved ethanol yield when compared to fermentation with either cellobiose or xylose as sole carbon sources. We also observed improved yields and productivities from <b>cofermentation</b> experiments performed with simulated cellulosic hydrolyzates, suggesting this is a promising <b>cofermentation</b> strategy for cellulosic biofuel production. The successful integration of cellobiose and xylose fermentation pathways in yeast is a critical step towards enabling economic biofuel production...|$|E
30|$|Prefermentation of hydrolyzate liquor {{followed}} by fed-batch separate hydrolysis and <b>cofermentation</b> improved ethanol yields, yet batch and fed-batch prefermentation had different {{impacts on the}} <b>cofermentation.</b> Under influence of lower inhibitor concentrations fed-batch prefermentation resulted in lower xylitol production during all steps of the fermentation and prompted higher final ethanol yields compared to corresponding cofermentations with batch prefermentation. Under influence of high inhibitor concentrations, sustained fermentation capacity was paramount to obtain improved ethanol yield. S. cerevisiae KE 6 - 12 was resilient to high inhibitor concentrations, but succumbed to continuous exposure to inhibitors. Regardless of type of slurry, continuous feed during prefermentation of the hydrolyzate liquor and multiple additions of enzymatic hydrolyzate—and their combination—appeared to hamper the fermentative capacity and exhaust the cells. The viability of the yeast, not glucose repression of xylose metabolism, {{appeared to be the}} limiting factor for higher ethanol yields in the cofermentations. The best results were obtained with mild slurry, applying fed-batch prefermentation and a single addition of enzymatic hydrolyzate. An ethanol yield of 0.423  g·g− 1, based on supplied glucose and xylose, and the lowest xylitol production, 0.036  g·g− 1, was obtained. A trade-off existed between promoting xylose conversion with substrate feeding and maintaining yeast viability, and ethanol yield was maximized with a balance between them.|$|E
