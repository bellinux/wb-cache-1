5|$|A {{large number}} of {{molecular}} alterations are under study for their prognostic impact in AML. However, only FLT3-ITD, NPM1, CEBPA and c-KIT are currently included in validated international risk stratification schema. These are expected to increase rapidly in the near future. FLT3 internal tandem duplications (ITDs) {{have been shown to}} confer a poorer prognosis in AML with normal <b>cytogenetics.</b> Several FLT3 inhibitors have undergone clinical trials, with mixed results. Two other mutations - NPM1 and biallelic CEBPA are associated with improved outcomes, especially in people with normal <b>cytogenetics</b> and are used in current risk stratification algorithms.|$|E
5|$|Later, the Southwest Oncology Group and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group and, later still, Cancer and Leukemia Group B {{published}} other, mostly overlapping {{lists of}} <b>cytogenetics</b> prognostication in leukemia.|$|E
5|$|The {{specific}} type of postremission therapy is individualized based on a person's prognostic factors (see above) and general health. For good-prognosis leukemias (i.e. inv(16), t(8;21), and t(15;17)), people will typically undergo an additional three to five courses of intensive chemotherapy, known as consolidation chemotherapy. For people {{at high risk of}} relapse (e.g. those with high-risk <b>cytogenetics,</b> underlying MDS, or therapy-related AML), allogeneic stem cell transplantation is usually recommended if the person is able to tolerate a transplant and has a suitable donor. The best postremission therapy for intermediate-risk AML (normal <b>cytogenetics</b> or cytogenetic changes not falling into good-risk or high-risk groups) is less clear and depends on the specific situation, including the age and overall health of the person, the person's values, and whether a suitable stem cell donor is available.|$|E
5|$|During her {{graduate}} studies and postgraduate appointment as a botany instructor, McClintock {{was instrumental in}} assembling a group that studied the new field of <b>cytogenetics</b> in maize. This group brought together plant breeders and cytologists, and included Marcus Rhoades, future Nobel laureate George Beadle, and Harriet Creighton. Rollins A. Emerson, head of the Plant Breeding Department, supported these efforts, although {{he was not a}} cytologist himself.|$|E
5|$|The French-American-British (FAB) {{classification}} system divides AML into eight subtypes, M0 through to M7, {{based on the}} type of cell from which the leukemia developed and its degree of maturity. This is done by examining the appearance of the malignant cells with light microscopy and/or by using <b>cytogenetics</b> to characterize any underlying chromosomal abnormalities. The subtypes have varying prognoses and responses to therapy. Although the WHO classification (see above) may be more useful, the FAB system is still widely used.|$|E
5|$|Virtual {{karyotyping}} can {{be performed}} on fresh or paraffin-embedded tumors to assess copy number at these loci. SNP array virtual karyotyping is preferred for tumor samples, including neuroblastomas, because they can detect copy neutral loss of heterozygosity (acquired uniparental disomy). Copy neutral LOH can be biologically equivalent to a deletion and has been detected at key loci in neuroblastoma. ArrayCGH, FISH, or conventional <b>cytogenetics</b> cannot detect copy neutral LOH.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{she made}} an {{extensive}} study of the <b>cytogenetics</b> and ethnobotany of maize races from South America. McClintock's research became well understood in the 1960s and 1970s, as other scientists confirmed the mechanisms of genetic change and genetic regulation that she had demonstrated in her maize research in the 1940s and 1950s. Awards and recognition for her contributions to the field followed, including the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, awarded to her in 1983 for the discovery of genetic transposition; {{she is the only}} woman to receive an unshared Nobel Prize in that category.|$|E
5|$|Marrow {{or blood}} is {{examined}} under light microscopy, {{as well as}} flow cytometry, to diagnose the presence of leukemia, to differentiate AML from other types of leukemia (e.g. acute lymphoblastic leukemia - ALL), and to classify the subtype of disease. A sample of marrow or blood is typically also tested for chromosomal abnormalities by routine <b>cytogenetics</b> or fluorescent in situ hybridization. Genetic studies may also be performed to look for specific mutations in genes such as FLT3, nucleophosmin, and KIT, which may influence {{the outcome of the}} disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{microscopic}} {{characteristics and}} <b>cytogenetics</b> of C.micaceus are well known, {{and it has}} been used frequently as a model organism to study cell division and meiosis in Basidiomycetes. Chemical analysis of the fruit bodies has revealed the presence of antibacterial and enzyme-inhibiting compounds. Formerly known as Coprinus micaceus, the species was transferred to Coprinellus in 2001 as phylogenetic analyses provided the impetus for a reorganization of the many species formerly grouped together in the genus Coprinus. Based on external appearance, C.micaceus is virtually indistinguishable from C.truncorum, {{and it has been}} suggested that many reported collections of the former may be of the latter.|$|E
5|$|Woodruff {{retired from}} the University of Edinburgh in 1976, his role then being filled by Prof Geoffrey Duncan Chisholm, and joined the MRC Clinical and Population <b>Cytogenetics</b> Unit. He spent {{the next ten years}} there, engaged in cancer {{research}} with an emphasis on tumor immunology using Corynebacterium parva. During that time, Woodruff also published twenty-five papers and two books. After retiring from his cancer research, Woodruff lived quietly with his wife in Edinburgh, traveling occasionally, until his death there on 10 March 2001 at the age of 89.|$|E
5|$|During {{her time}} at Missouri, McClintock {{expanded}} her {{research on the}} effect of X-rays on maize <b>cytogenetics.</b> McClintock observed the breakage and fusion of chromosomes in irradiated maize cells. She was also able to show that, in some plants, spontaneous chromosome breakage occurred in the cells of the endosperm. Over the course of mitosis, she observed that the ends of broken chromatids were rejoined after the chromosome replication. In the anaphase of mitosis, the broken chromosomes formed a chromatid bridge, which was broken when the chromatids moved towards the cell poles. The broken ends were rejoined in the interphase of the next mitosis, and the cycle was repeated, causing massive mutation, which she could detect as variegation in the endosperm. This breakage–rejoining–bridge cycle was a key cytogenetic discovery for several reasons. First, it showed that the rejoining of chromosomes was not a random event, and second, it demonstrated a source of large-scale mutation. For this reason, it remains an area of interest in cancer research today.|$|E
5|$|McClintock's {{cytogenetic}} research {{focused on}} developing ways to visualize and characterize maize chromosomes. This particular {{part of her}} work influenced a generation of students, as it was included in most textbooks. She also developed a technique using carmine staining to visualize maize chromosomes, and showed {{for the first time}} the morphology of the 10 maize chromosomes. This discovery was made because she observed cells from the microspore as opposed to the root tip. By studying the morphology of the chromosomes, McClintock was able to link specific chromosome groups of traits that were inherited together. Marcus Rhoades noted that McClintock's 1929 Genetics paper on the characterization of triploid maize chromosomes triggered scientific interest in maize <b>cytogenetics,</b> and attributed to her 10 of the 17 significant advances in the field that were made by Cornell scientists between 1929 and 1935.|$|E
5|$|Stebbins's Ph.D. {{was granted}} by Harvard in 1931. In March that year, he married Margaret Chamberlin, {{with whom he}} had three children. In 1932, he took a {{teaching}} position in biology at Colgate University. While at Colgate, he continued his work in cytogenetics; in particular, he continued to study the genetics of Antennaria and began to study the behaviour of chromosomes in hybrid peonies bred by biologist Percy Saunders. Saunders and Stebbins attended the 1932 International Congress of Genetics in Ithaca, New York. Here, Stebbins's interest was captured by talks given by Thomas Hunt Morgan and Barbara McClintock, who spoke about chromosomal crossover. Stebbins reproduced McClintock's crossover experiments in the peony, and published several papers on the <b>cytogenetics</b> of Paeonia, which established his reputation as a geneticist.|$|E
5|$|Barbara McClintock (June 16, 1902 – September 2, 1992) was an American {{scientist}} and cytogeneticist who {{was awarded the}} 1983 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. McClintock received her PhD in botany from Cornell University in 1927. There she started her career as the leader {{in the development of}} maize <b>cytogenetics,</b> the focus of her research {{for the rest of her}} life. From the late 1920s, McClintock studied chromosomes and how they change during reproduction in maize. She developed the technique for visualizing maize chromosomes and used microscopic analysis to demonstrate many fundamental genetic ideas. One of those ideas was the notion of genetic recombination by crossing-over during meiosis—a mechanism by which chromosomes exchange information. She produced the first genetic map for maize, linking regions of the chromosome to physical traits. She demonstrated the role of the telomere and centromere, regions of the chromosome that are important in the conservation of genetic information. She was recognized among the best in the field, awarded prestigious fellowships, and elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Variation and Evolution in Plants was {{the first}} book to provide a wide-ranging {{explanation}} of how evolutionary mechanisms operated in plants at the genetic level. It brought concepts related to plant evolution into line with animal evolution as it emerged from Dobzhansky's 1937 Genetics and the Origin of Species and provided the conceptual framework to organize a disparate set of disciplines into a new field: plant evolutionary biology. In the book Stebbins argued that evolution needed to be studied as a dynamic problem and that evolution must be considered on three levels: first, that of individual variation within an interbreeding population; second, that of the distribution and frequency of this variation; and third, that of the separation and divergence of populations {{as the result of}} the building up of isolating mechanisms leading to the formation of species. He used the work of biosystematists Clausen, Keck, Hiesey, and Turesson to show that it was possible to distinguish between genotypic and phenotypic variationthat is, genetically identical plants could have different phenotypes in different environments. One of the book's most original chapters used the <b>cytogenetics</b> work of C. D. Darlington to show that genetic systems like hybridization and polyploidy were also subject to selection.|$|E
25|$|Mammalian {{comparative}} <b>cytogenetics,</b> {{an indispensable}} part of phylogenomics, has evolved {{in a series}} of steps from pure description to the more heuristic science of the genomic era. Technical advances have marked the various developmental steps of <b>cytogenetics.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Cyto{{genetics}}</b> is {{a branch}} of genetics that is concerned with how the chromosomes relate to cell behaviour, particularly to their behaviour during mitosis and meiosis. Techniques used include karyotyping, analysis of G-banded chromosomes, other cytogenetic banding techniques, as well as molecular <b>cytogenetics</b> such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH).|$|E
25|$|Genetics is {{also studied}} {{along with a}} {{subspecialty}} known as <b>cytogenetics.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tissue <b>cytogenetics</b> - the {{visualization}} of chromosomes to identify genetics defects such as chromosomal translocation.|$|E
25|$|Cytogenetic {{abnormalities}} can {{be detected}} by conventional <b>cytogenetics,</b> a FISH panel for MDS, or virtual karyotype.|$|E
25|$|In general, the {{karyotype}} is {{the characteristic}} chromosome complement of a eukaryote species. The preparation and study of karyotypes {{is part of}} <b>cytogenetics.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Cytogenetics</b> {{involves}} using {{blood and}} other cells {{to get a}} karyotype. This {{can be helpful in}} prenatal diagnosis (e.g. Down's syndrome) as well as in cancer (some cancers have abnormal chromosomes).|$|E
25|$|Advances now {{focus on}} {{molecular}} <b>cytogenetics</b> including automated systems for counting {{the results of}} standard FISH preparations and techniques for virtual karyotyping, such as comparative genomic hybridization arrays, CGH and Single nucleotide polymorphism arrays.|$|E
25|$|Virtual {{karyotyping}} can be {{done for}} MDS, which uses computational tools to construct the karyogram from disrupted DNA. Virtual karyotyping does not require cell culture and has dramatically higher resolution than conventional <b>cytogenetics,</b> but cannot detect balanced translocations.|$|E
25|$|Medical {{genetics}} – {{the application}} of genetics to medicine. Medical genetics is a broad and varied field. It encompasses many different individual fields, including clinical genetics, biochemical genetics, <b>cytogenetics,</b> molecular genetics, the genetics of common diseases (such as neural tube defects), and genetic counseling.|$|E
25|$|CML {{is often}} {{suspected}} {{on the basis}} of a complete blood count, which shows increased granulocytes of all types, typically including mature myeloid cells. Basophils and eosinophils are almost universally increased; this feature may help differentiate CML from a leukemoid reaction. A bone marrow biopsy is often performed as part of the evaluation for CML, and CML is diagnosed by <b>cytogenetics</b> that detects the translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) which involves the ABL1 gene in chromosome 9 and the BCR gene in chromosome 22. As a result of this translocation, the chromosome looks smaller than its homologue chromosome, and this appearance is known as the Philadelphia chromosome chromosomal abnormality. Thus, this abnormality can be detected by routine <b>cytogenetics,</b> and the involved genes BCR-ABL1 can be detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization, as well as by PCR.|$|E
25|$|In {{comparative}} <b>cytogenetics,</b> chromosome homology between {{species was}} proposed {{on the basis}} of similarities in banding patterns. Closely related species often had very similar banding pattern and after 40 years of comparing bands it seems safe to generalize that karyotype divergence in most taxonomic groups follows their phylogenetic relationship, despite notable exceptions.|$|E
25|$|Analysis of FISH {{specimens}} {{is done by}} {{fluorescence microscopy}} by a clinical laboratory specialist in <b>cytogenetics.</b> For oncology generally {{a large number of}} interphase cells are scored in order to rule out low-level residual disease, generally between 200 and 1,000 cells are counted and scored. For congenital problems usually 20metaphase cells are scored.|$|E
25|$|Karyotypes {{describe}} the chromosome count of an organism and what these chromosomes look like under a light microscope. Attention {{is paid to}} their length, {{the position of the}} centromeres, banding pattern, any differences between the sex chromosomes, and any other physical characteristics. The preparation and study of karyotypes is part of <b>cytogenetics.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1947, {{the year}} of Indian {{independence}} {{he moved to the}} Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) in New Delhi as a post-graduate student in genetics and plant breeding. He obtained a post-graduate degree with high distinction in <b>Cytogenetics</b> in 1949. He wrote the Union Public Service Commission exam and qualified for the Indian Police Service.|$|E
25|$|A {{seemingly}} logical {{consequence of}} descent from common ancestors {{is that more}} closely related species should have more chromosomes in common. However, it is now widely thought that species may have phenetically similar karyotypes due to genomic conservation. Therefore, in comparative <b>cytogenetics,</b> phylogenetic relationships should be determined {{on the basis of}} the polarity of chromosomal differences (derived traits).|$|E
25|$|Diagrams {{identifying}} the chromosomes {{based on the}} banding patterns are known as idiograms. These maps {{became the basis for}} both prenatal and oncological fields to quickly move <b>cytogenetics</b> into the clinical lab where karyotyping allowed scientists to look for chromosomal alterations. Techniques were expanded to allow for culture of free amniocytes recovered from amniotic fluid, and elongation techniques for all culture types that allow for higher-resolution banding.|$|E
25|$|Sequencing efforts {{provided}} {{a variety of}} products useful in molecular <b>cytogenetics.</b> Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with DNA clones (BAC and YAC clones, cosmids) allowed the construction of chromosome maps at a resolution of several megabases that could detect relatively small chromosome rearrangements. A resolution of several kilobases can be achieved on interphase chromatin. A limitation is that hybridization efficiencies decrease with increasing phylogenetic distance.|$|E
25|$|Analysis of banded {{chromosomes}} is done at {{a microscope}} by a clinical laboratory specialist in <b>cytogenetics</b> (CLSp(CG)). Generally 20 cells are analyzed which {{is enough to}} rule out mosaicism to an acceptable level. The results are summarized and given to a board-certified cytogeneticist for review, and to write an interpretation {{taking into account the}} patients previous history and other clinical findings. The results are then given out reported in an International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature 2009 (ISCN2009).|$|E
25|$|Pathology as {{a medical}} {{specialty}} is the branch of medicine that deals with the study of diseases and the morphologic, physiologic changes produced by them. As a diagnostic specialty, pathology can be considered the basis of modern scientific medical knowledge and plays {{a large role in}} evidence-based medicine. Many modern molecular tests such as flow cytometry, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunohistochemistry, <b>cytogenetics,</b> gene rearrangements studies and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) fall within the territory of pathology.|$|E
25|$|In the 2000s {{understanding}} of the relationships among eutherian mammals has experienced a virtual revolution. Molecular phylogenomics, new fossil finds and innovative morphological interpretations now group the more than 4600 extant species of eutherians into four major super-ordinal clades: Euarchontoglires (including Primates, Dermoptera, Scandentia, Rodentia, and Lagomorpha), Laurasiatheria (Cetartiodactyla, Perissodactyla, Carnivora, Chiroptera, Pholidota, and Eulipotyphla), Xenarthra, and Afrotheria (Proboscidea, Sirenia, Hyracoidea, Afrosoricida, Tubulidentata, and Macroscelidea). This tree is very useful in unifying the parts of a puzzle in comparative mammalian <b>cytogenetics.</b>|$|E
