A next generation technology that could continue the success of CMOS in microelectronics has currently not been identified for integrated logic circuits or for memory. There are however promising concepts of devices that could allow for further scaling in a hybrid combination with CMOS circuits. For example, for future non-volatile memories, devices are under research {{that are based on}} switching materials and show two stable resistive states. Without selection transistors, the size of a memory cell is only dependent on the electrode dimensions and can be theoretically realized in the smallest possible area of 4 F². Such layouts, where the intersection of a word and bit line simultane-ously forms the connecting electrodes of the memory cell, are called passive <b>crossbar</b> <b>arrays.</b> As long as the memory elements show a sufficient amount of directivity, writing to and reading from such <b>crossbar</b> <b>arrays</b> with active CMOS circuits can be realized. This dissertation addresses the actual and challenging question; which write or read schemes are the most beneficial and what design space arises due to the memory element properties given their fundamental limits. This applies even more for state-of-the-art memory elements as directivity is not easily accomplished. Without such directivity currents going through non-selected cells, aggravate reading and writing renders these operations impossible. A simplified equivalent circuit diagram was developed for which the nodes and mesh equations for different read/write-circuits could be solved in closed-form. This mathematic model is used to analyze the impact of parasitic elements in the array and is supported by a simulative approach.
