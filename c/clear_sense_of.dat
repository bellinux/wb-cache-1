5|$|The camera {{work and}} editing work {{together}} to further heighten the frightening qualities of the film. Eleanor is often viewed from above, and in one scene the camera closes in so tightly on her that she is forced backward over a railing. Eleanor's viewpoint is often juxtaposed with eerie views of the house, as if both viewpoints were the same. Many of the editing choices in the film are also used to heighten the audience's discomfort. There {{are a number of}} rapid cuts in the film that throw off the viewer's sense of spatial orientation, and Dutch angles are used to imply that reality is off-kilter. Cutting on action—showing the characters exiting a room to the right, only to show them entering the next room from the left—is often violated, so that the viewer cannot get a <b>clear</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> which rooms and hallways are connected to one another. The audience also lacks temporal clues. There are few shots in which they can see out a window to determine whether it's night or day. When Eleanor is rescued by Dr. Markway on the unstable spiral staircase, some of the windows nearby show strong sunlight streaming in, while others show darkness outside.|$|E

25|$|In addition, {{the eleven}} SNC members {{had formed a}} {{coalition}} with the SYL, which held 120 of the 123 seats in the National Assembly. A few of these 120 left the SYL after the composition of Egal's cabinet became clear and after the announcement of his program, {{both of which were}} bound to displease some who had joined only to be on the winning side. Offered a huge list of candidates, the almost 900,000 voters in 1969 took delight in defeating incumbents. Of the incumbent deputies, 77 out of 123 were not returned (including 8 out of 18 members of the previous cabinet), but these figures did not unequivocally demonstrate dissatisfaction with the government. Statistically, they were nearly identical with the results of the 1964 election, and, given the profusion of parties and the system of proportional representation, a <b>clear</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> public opinion could not be obtained {{solely on the basis of}} the election results. The fact that a single party—the SYL—dominated the field implied neither stability nor solidarity. Anthropologist Ioan M.

Moore's death in 1993, {{just days after the}} last edition of the Roy of the Rovers comic was published, produced a [...] "literature of tribute", framed around themes [...] "remarkably similar to those {{at the center of the}} Roy Race fiction and ideology... there was a <b>clear</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> mourning for the loss of an age".|$|E

[...] Charles Holden described Pick's management of meetings: [...] "Here his decisions were those of a benevolent dictator, and the members left the meeting with a <b>clear</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> a task to be performed, difficult, perhaps, and sometimes impossible, as might subsequently prove to be, but usually well worth exploring if only in producing convincing proof of obstacles. Out of these exploratory methods there often emerged new and most interesting solutions, which Pick was quick to appreciate, and to adopt in substitution for his own proposals." ...|$|E

500|$|As a senator, Palpatine is [...] "unassuming, yet ambitious". In Cloak of Deception, James Luceno {{writes that}} Palpatine {{carefully}} guards his privacy and [...] "others found his reclusiveness intriguing, {{as if he}} led a secret life". Despite this, he has many allies in the government. Luceno writes, [...] "What Palpatine lacked in charisma, he made up for in candor, {{and it was that}} directness that had led to his widespread appeal in the senate. ... For in his heart he judged the universe on his own terms, with a <b>clear</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> right and wrong." [...] In Terry Brooks' , Palpatine claims to embrace democratic principles.

500|$|As {{children}} {{coming of}} age, Scout and Jem face hard realities {{and learn from}} them. Lee seems to examine Jem's sense of loss about how his neighbors have disappointed him more than Scout's. Jem says to their neighbor Miss Maudie {{the day after the}} trial, [...] "It's like bein' a caterpillar wrapped in a cocoon... I always thought Maycomb folks were the best folks in the world, least that's what they seemed like". This leads him to struggle with understanding the separations of race and class. Just as the novel is an illustration of the changes Jem faces, it is also an exploration of the realities Scout must face as an atypical girl on the verge of womanhood. As one scholar writes, [...] "To Kill a Mockingbird can be read as a feminist Bildungsroman, for Scout emerges from her childhood experiences with a <b>clear</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> her place in her community and an awareness of her potential power as the woman she will one day be." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{evolution}} and maturation of the protagonist, Bilbo Baggins, {{is central to}} the story. This journey of maturation, where Bilbo gains a <b>clear</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> identity and confidence in the outside world, may be seen as a Bildungsroman rather than a traditional quest. The Jungian concept of individuation is also reflected through this theme of growing maturity and capability, with the author contrasting Bilbo's personal growth against the arrested development of the dwarves. Thus, while Gandalf exerts a parental influence over Bilbo early on, it is Bilbo who gradually takes over leadership of the party, a fact the dwarves could not bear to acknowledge. The analogue of the [...] "underworld" [...] and the hero returning from it with a boon (such as the ring, or Elvish blades) that benefits his society is seen to fit the mythic archetypes regarding initiation and male coming-of-age as described by Joseph Campbell. Chance compares the development and growth of Bilbo against other characters to the concepts of just kingship versus sinful kingship derived from the Ancrene Wisse (which Tolkien had written on in 1929) and a Christian understanding of Beowulf.|$|E
40|$|Through {{decentralized}} {{targeting of}} input vouchers new agricultural input subsidy programs aim to more effectively reach their objectives and target population. But, lingering fears of elite capture remain. These are borne {{out in the}} 2009 input voucher program in Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. Sixty percent of the voucher beneficiaries were households with village officials. This significantly reduced the targeting performance of the program, especially in unequal and remote communities. When targeting the poor, greater coverage and concentration in higher trust settings mitigated these concerns. Scrutiny remains important when relying on decentralized targeting, as is a <b>clearer</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> purpose of input vouchers...|$|R

500|$|Heseltine {{spent much}} of the 1915 summer in a rented holiday cottage in the Vale of Evesham, with a party that {{included}} a young artist's model named Minnie Lucie Channing, who was known as [...] "Puma" [...] because of her volatile temperament. She and Heseltine soon entered into a passionate love affair. During this summer break Heseltine shocked neighbours by his uninhibited behaviour, which included riding a motorcycle naked [...] down nearby Crickley Hill. However, his letters show that at this time he was often depressed and insecure, lacking any <b>clear</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> purpose. In November 1915 his life gained some impetus when he met D. H. Lawrence and the pair found an immediate rapport. Heseltine declared Lawrence to be [...] "the greatest literary genius of his generation", and enthusiastically fell in with the writer's plans to found a Utopian colony in America. In late December he followed the Lawrences to Cornwall, where he tried, unavailingly, to set up a publishing company with them. Passions between Heseltine and Puma had meanwhile cooled; when she revealed that she was pregnant, Heseltine confided to Delius that he had little liking for her and had no intention of helping her to raise this unwanted child.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, Pru {{received}} {{positive feedback}} from music critics. Ed Hogan praised Pru's experimentation with musical genres. In discussing its many influences, Colin Ross {{wrote that the}} album never sounded uneven or disjointed. He commended the singer for communicating a range of emotions, by turns seeming [...] "innocent, self-assured, uncertain, elated and vulnerable", praising in particular the album's instrumentation and lyrics. A Billboard writer described Pru as [...] "sparkl with colorfully imaged songs about love won, lost and anticipated". USA Todays Steve Jones praised the performer for the [...] "remarkable depth in her poetics about joy and heartbreak". Jones wrote that the album demonstrated that Pru had a <b>clear</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> {{what she wanted to}} achieve for her career and sound. Ebonys Lynn Norment described her as possessing a [...] "rich, earthy voice and lyrical talent", responding positively to the artist's influences from scripture and poetry. A writer for Sister 2 Sister commended Pru for her ability to convey emotion to the listener, and identified [...] "Prophecy of a Flower" [...] as their favorite track from the album. The Houston Press' Craig D. Lindsey praised Pru's music and live performances, describing her songs as [...] "soulful, earthy and organic" [...] and the antithesis to music such as Destiny's Child's 1999 single [...] "Bills, Bills, Bills". The album was called [...] "rtful... stunning... sexy" [...] by a reviewer from People.|$|E
500|$|Critics adulated the {{character}} development of Rick Grimes, {{as well as}} the concluding scene of [...] "Nebraska". Kine appreciated the attempt to incorporate a suspenseful feeling in the series. She wrote: [...] "Mazzara wants to infuse some horror movie suspense back into the show and his intentions are evident in this scene. Even though I personally didn’t find it that tense, I appreciated the effort. It means that the show is trying to expand and become about something bigger." [...] Los Angeles Times Gina McIntyre felt that Rick emulated Justified character Raylan Givens, and Halden commented that Rick was becoming [...] "something of a badass". Halden further praised the conclusion of the episode, calling it the series' best scenes. [...] "This {{is one of the best}} scenes I’ve seen on the show so far, and it does any number of things that The Walking Dead has struggled with in the past," [...] he opined. [...] "The tension builds naturally , the dialogue has actual subtext, and there’s a <b>clear</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> risk here that never pauses to telegraph itself." [...] Meslow affirmed that the scene was an achievement for the writers. [...] "There are characters with new information ," [...] Meslow commented. [...] "There is dialogue with subtext [...] There is intriguing parallel plotting [...] And there's the surprisingly swift, violent dénouement, when Rick guns down Dave and Tony before they can do the same to him. It's a necessary action, given the circumstances, but it also rings in an honest-to-god character change for our hero, who, having dispatched zombie Sophia, seems to have developed a new recognition of the ruthlessness and self-centeredness it may take to survive in this new world order." [...] HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall appreciated James' performance, and opined that the scene was [...] "as suspenseful as any the show has ever done featuring actual monsters".|$|E

30|$|Semantic {{components}} are “separate, combinable, exploitable entities” (ibid.). The instantiated lexical item {{such as in}} (9) or (10) will involve some combination of the components. Using semantic components this way enables a <b>clearer</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> where the division between polysemy and homonymy lies. For example, BANK as in river bank does not share any semantic components with BANK in the examples which suggests separate lexemes, despite the similar form. For Hanks, a word gets its meaning from its use and in this sense, meaning is dynamic.|$|R

500|$|Several more of Blair's {{former colleagues}} and {{political}} opponents also {{commented on the}} book. Former Conservative minister Norman Tebbit wrote in The Daily Telegraph, [...] "A Journey seems {{to be dominated by}} Blair's anxiety {{to be seen as a}} great political leader who changed his country for the better. In fact it is, as I suppose all such books are to some extent, entirely about justifying himself and blaming others." [...] However, Tebbit admitted he had not read the book at the time of writing about it and based his opinion on media coverage. Writing in The Guardian, Alistair Darling, who was Chancellor under Gordon Brown, said that he [...] "read with wry amusement how Tony Blair felt after much agonising that he couldn't sack his Chancellor. History has a habit of repeating itself." [...] He concluded that the book was [...] "a good read and shows us what can be done when we have confidence, clarity and a <b>clear</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> purpose: we can win and change the country for the better." [...] Labour Member of Parliament Tom Harris said that the book [...] "will be a reminder that opposition doesn't have to be permanent, and that great things can be accomplished by a Labour government, but only if we have a leader capable of appealing to voters beyond our own party's core." [...] Of Blair, he said, [...] "There are still many, many Labour Party members who remember Blair as an election-winning genius who, in office, was popular for an awful lot longer than he was unpopular." [...] Ed Miliband, then vying for the vacant position of Labour Party leader, said on the day of publication, [...] "I think it is time to move on from Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and Peter Mandelson and to move on from the New Labour establishment and that is the candidate that I am at this election who can best turn the page. I think frankly most members of the public will want us to turn the page." [...] He was elected as Leader of the Labour Party several weeks later.|$|E
