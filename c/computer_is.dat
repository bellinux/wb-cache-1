5|$|Sleep-and-charge USB ports {{can be used}} {{to charge}} {{electronic}} devices even when the <b>computer</b> <b>is</b> switched off. Normally, when a <b>computer</b> <b>is</b> powered off the USB ports are powered down, preventing phones and other devices from charging. Sleep-and-charge USB ports remain powered even when the <b>computer</b> <b>is</b> off. On laptops, charging devices from the USB port when it is not being powered from AC drains the laptop battery faster; most laptops have a facility to stop charging if their own battery charge level gets too low. This feature has also been implemented on some laptop docking stations allowing device charging even when no laptop is present.|$|E
5|$|Following the Nimda and Code Red worms, {{this version}} scans all {{incoming}} and outgoing traffic for suspicious data exchanges against a routinely updated database, a feature ported from Norton Internet Security 2002 Professional Edition. Connection to the offending <b>computer</b> <b>is</b> automatically severed if the traffic matches a database item.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, scans are {{no longer}} {{scheduled}} through the Windows Task Scheduler, but through the Symantec's proprietary one, which performs tasks while the <b>computer</b> <b>is</b> idle (i.e., when the user is away from the computer).|$|E
25|$|Wearable <b>computers</b> <b>are</b> <b>computers</b> {{which can}} <b>be</b> worn on the body. Wearable <b>computers</b> <b>are</b> {{especially}} useful for applications that require computational support while the user's hands, voice, eyes or attention are actively engaged {{with the physical}} environment. The wearable <b>computer</b> <b>was</b> first conceived by American mathematician Edward O. Thorp in 1955 and co-invented with American electronic engineer Claude Shannon.|$|R

30|$|Laptop <b>computers</b> <b>were</b> {{typically}} used in early mobile AR prototypes [19] as backpack computing platforms. Compared to desktop <b>computers,</b> laptop <b>computers</b> <b>are</b> more flexible to carry; however, {{size and weight}} is still the hurdle for wide acceptance by most users. Since laptop <b>computers</b> <b>are</b> configured as a backpack setup, additional display devices such as head-mounted displays are required for display.|$|R
5|$|Analog {{computers}} {{work directly}} with physical quantities, so their addition mechanisms {{depend on the}} form of the addends. A mechanical adder might represent two addends as the positions of sliding blocks, in which case they can be added with an averaging lever. If the addends are the rotation speeds of two shafts, they can be added with a differential. A hydraulic adder can add the pressures in two chambers by exploiting Newton's second law to balance forces on an assembly of pistons. The most common situation for a general-purpose analog <b>computer</b> <b>is</b> to add two voltages (referenced to ground); this can be accomplished roughly with a resistor network, but a better design exploits an operational amplifier.|$|E
5|$|At {{work at the}} Buy More, Chuck is {{approached}} at the Nerd Herd counter by Sarah Walker (Yvonne Strahovski). After Chuck fixes Sarah's phone, {{she leaves}} him her phone number, but he decides not to call her. He arrives home to find an intruder stealing his computer. After the <b>computer</b> <b>is</b> dropped and destroyed, the intruder escapes and is revealed to be Sarah, a CIA agent.|$|E
5|$|Electromagnetic articulography (EMA) is {{a method}} of {{measuring}} the position of parts of the mouth. EMA uses sensor coils placed on the tongue {{and other parts of}} the mouth to measure their position and movement over time during speech and swallowing. Induction coils around the head produce an electromagnetic field that creates, or induces, a current in the sensors in the mouth. Because the current induced is inversely proportional to the cube of the distance, a <b>computer</b> <b>is</b> able to analyse the current produced and determine the sensor coil's location in space.|$|E
50|$|Embedded <b>{{computers}}</b> <b>are</b> <b>computers</b> that <b>are</b> {{a part of}} {{a machine}} or device. Embedded computers generally execute a program that is stored in non-volatile memory and is only intended to operate a specific machine or device. Embedded <b>computers</b> <b>are</b> very common. Embedded <b>computers</b> <b>are</b> typically required to operate continuously without being reset or rebooted, and once employed in their task the software usually cannot be modified. An automobile may contain a number of embedded computers; however, a washing machine and a DVD player would contain only one. The central processing units (CPUs) used in embedded <b>computers</b> <b>are</b> often sufficient only for the computational requirements of the specific application and may be slower and cheaper than CPUs found in a personal computer.|$|R

5|$|Elgato {{introduced}} a Thunderbolt docking station in June 2014. A <b>computer</b> <b>is</b> {{plugged into the}} dock using a Thunderbolt port {{in order to gain}} access to the dock's three USB ports, audio jacks, HDMI and ethernet. It is typically used to plug a Macbook into an office setting (printer, monitor, keyboard) or to provide additional ports not available in the Macbook Air. A review in The Register said it was compact and useful, but Windows users should consider a USB 3.0 dock. The Register and CNET disagreed on whether it was competitively priced. Reviews in TechRadar and Macworld gave it 4 out of 5 stars.|$|E
5|$|In PowerPC-based Macintoshes, {{the boot}} process {{starts with the}} {{activation}} of BootROM, the basic Macintosh ROM, which performs a Power On Self Test to test hardware essential to startup. On the passing of this test, the startup chime is played {{and control of the}} <b>computer</b> <b>is</b> passed to OpenFirmware. OpenFirmware initializes the Random Access Memory, Memory Management Unit and hardware necessary for the ROM's operation. The OpenFirmware then checks settings, stored in NVRAM, and builds a list of all devices on a device tree by gathering their stored FCode information.|$|E

5|$|MRO's main <b>computer</b> <b>is</b> a 133MHz, 10.4million transistor, 32-bit, RAD750 {{processor}}. This processor is a radiation-hardened {{version of}} a PowerPC 750 or G3 processor with a specially built motherboard. The RAD750 is a successor to the RAD6000. This processor may seem underpowered in comparison to a modern PC processor, but it is extremely reliable, resilient, and can function in solar flare-ravaged deep space. The operating system software is VxWorks and has extensive fault protection protocols and monitoring.|$|E
5|$|Main {{memory in}} a {{parallel}} <b>computer</b> <b>is</b> either shared memory (shared between all processing elements in a single address space), or distributed memory (in which each processing element has its own local address space). Distributed memory refers {{to the fact that}} the memory is logically distributed, but often implies that it is physically distributed as well. Distributed shared memory and memory virtualization combine the two approaches, where the processing element has its own local memory and access to the memory on non-local processors. Accesses to local memory are typically faster than accesses to non-local memory.|$|E
5|$|Servicing Mission 3A, {{flown by}} Discovery, {{took place in}} December 1999, and was a {{split-off}} from Servicing Mission 3 after three of the six onboard gyroscopes had failed. The fourth failed {{a few weeks before}} the mission, rendering the telescope incapable of performing scientific observations. The mission replaced all six gyroscopes, replaced a Fine Guidance Sensor and the computer, installed a Voltage/temperature Improvement Kit (VIK) to prevent battery overcharging, and replaced thermal insulation blankets. The new <b>computer</b> <b>is</b> 20 times faster, with six times more memory, than the DF-224 it replaced. It increases throughput by moving some computing tasks from the ground to the spacecraft and saves money by allowing the use of modern programming languages.|$|E

50|$|The term {{mainframe}} <b>computer</b> <b>was</b> {{created to}} distinguish the traditional, large, institutional computer intended to service multiple users from the smaller, single user machines. These <b>computers</b> <b>are</b> capable of handling and processing very large amounts of data quickly. Mainframe <b>computers</b> <b>are</b> used in large institutions such as government, banks and large corporations.They are measured in MIPS (million instructions per second) and can respond to {{hundreds of millions of}} users at a time.|$|R
5|$|The {{computer}} command subsystem (CCS) {{controls the}} cameras. The CCS contains fixed computer {{programs such as}} command decoding, fault detection and correction routines, antenna pointing routines, and spacecraft sequencing routines. This <b>computer</b> <b>is</b> an improved version of {{the one that was}} used in the 1970s Viking orbiters. The hardware in both custom-built CCS subsystems in the Voyagers is identical. There is only a minor software modification for one of them that has a scientific subsystem that the other lacks.|$|E
5|$|A {{personal}} dive <b>computer</b> <b>is</b> a small computer {{designed to}} be worn by a diver during a dive, with a pressure sensor and an electronic timer mounted in a waterproof and pressure resistant housing which has been programmed to model the inert gas loading of the diver's tissues in real time during a dive. A display allows the diver to see critical data during the dive, including the maximum and current depth, duration of the dive, and decompression data including the remaining no decompression limit calculated in real time for the diver throughout the dive. The dive computer keeps track of residual gas loading for each tissue used in the algorithm. Dive computers also provide a measure of safety for divers who accidentally dive a different profile to that originally planned. Most dive computers will provide the necessary decompression information for acceptably safe ascent {{in the event that}} the no-decompression limits are exceeded. The use of computers to manage recreational dive decompression is becoming the standard and their use is also common in occupational scientific diving. Their value in surface supplied commercial diving is more restricted, but they can usefully serve as a dive profile recorder.|$|E
5|$|As {{they return}} to the city, Olivia and Charlie discuss plans with Astrid on how to capture Milo, but realize that since he can predict their every move, any plan would be futile, and {{approach}} the hotel directly. Milo leads Olivia on a chase through a construction area including a marked zone where the air is too thin, expecting to crush her under a load of cement bricks. Olivia, unaware of the warning signs for the zone, races through it instead of stopping {{to put on a}} respirator, nearly asphyxiating herself, and dodges the bricks in time to capture Milo. At the center, Dr. Levin notes that Milo's condition is too far advanced to reverse, and only a <b>computer</b> <b>is</b> able to keep up with his thoughts. Madeline sadly leaves the toy horse at Milo's side.|$|E

5|$|Assisted by {{the school}} janitor Mister One, and pursued by a {{grotesque}} scarecrow-like being named Labor 9 who suddenly appears on the school grounds, Ryouta and Sakuya begin investigating the dome and the murder. They visit the lab and compare alibis; Shuu, who Ryouta distrusts, asks if Ryouta has forgotten anything important, to which he replies that he hasn't. Upon investigating the headmaster's office, they discover the headmaster had likewise been poisoned to death, what they saw earlier being merely pre-recorded footage; they also find a computer {{and a pair of}} documents, one titled The Human Representative and a torn, unreadable one titled Operation Hatoful. The Human Representative reveals that if the protagonist, a symbol of humanity, were to die, the campus would be sealed off and the birds inside handed over to humans as sacrifices—something confirmed when the <b>computer</b> <b>is</b> used to open a small hatch in the dome and students are shot dead as they attempt to flee—when the dome is lifted twelve hours after her death is reported.|$|E
