5|$|In a {{telephone}} network, the <b>caller</b> <b>is</b> {{connected to the}} person {{they want to talk}} to by switches at various telephone exchanges. The switches form an electrical connection between the two users and the setting of these switches is determined electronically when the caller dials the number. Once the connection is made, the caller's voice is transformed to an electrical signal using a small microphone in the caller's handset. This electrical signal is then sent through the network to the user at the other end where it is transformed back into sound by a small speaker in that person's handset.|$|E
5|$|Sridhar's {{computer}} data {{reveals a}} code, which when deciphered reveals Bhaskaran's phone number. Vidya calls Bhaskaran {{to tell him}} that she has retrieved sensitive documents from Sridhar's office. She asks Bhaskaran to help find her husband in exchange for the documents, but Bhaskaran tells her to contact the local police. Vidya soon gets a call from an unknown number however, warning her that she should hand over the documents to the caller if she wishes to see her husband alive. Khan thinks the <b>caller</b> <b>is</b> Milan Damji.|$|E
25|$|The {{telephone}} triage {{system used}} within the communication centres is the internationally regarded Advanced Priority Medical Dispatch System {{also known as}} ProQA whereby the <b>caller</b> <b>is</b> interrogated to determine the most appropriate problem detriment to guide the level of response in terms of speed and clinical capability.|$|E
50|$|Many <b>callers</b> <b>are</b> {{very well}} known {{for their ability to}} put calls {{together}} to create a unique, smooth-flowing dance. Some <b>callers</b> <b>are</b> also known for the unusual and interesting formations they move the dancers through.|$|R
50|$|<b>Callers</b> <b>are</b> {{selected}} randomly by {{a computer}} and at random times throughout the episode, including commercials. Should a <b>caller</b> <b>be</b> selected during a commercial break, the answer is taken immediately following {{the conclusion of the}} break.|$|R

Other information available includes current weather information, a search for restaurants as well as other features. If the <b>caller</b> <b>is</b> unsure of some of the details needed, the live operator can make suggestions or offer assistance in numerous categories.|$|E
25|$|Mobile phones {{generate}} additional {{problems for}} emergency operators, as many phones will allow emergency numbers to be dialed {{even while the}} keypad is locked. Since mobile phones are typically carried in pockets and small bags, the keys can easily be depressed accidentally, leading to unintended calls. A system has been developed in the UK to connect calls where the <b>caller</b> <b>is</b> sent to an automated system, leaving more operators free to handle genuine emergency calls.|$|E
25|$|Once a call via {{the local}} {{emergency}} number is placed, a dispatcher will answer {{and ask the}} caller {{about the nature of}} the emergency. Due to dual training in joint dispatch centers, the dispatcher is able to answer calls concerning both the fire department and EMS. While the <b>caller</b> <b>is</b> being interviewed about call specifics, the dispatcher is already working on the computer, which will provide prompt questions, provide advice, and suggest response resources for this emergency. This computer system, while operating in German, is extremely similar to the AMPDS algorithm used by Emergency Medical Dispatchers in the United States.|$|E

50|$|The 75p per {{call cost}} of a chance of {{involvement}} in shows, higher from mobile phones. <b>Callers</b> <b>were</b> charged for each call they made, whether connected to the studio or not. ITV had promised to make its programmes with higher production values than quiz programmes on other quiz channels, but with little evidence of such.

2500|$|Legal scholars' main {{criticism}} of the decision was its failure to define [...] "testimonial". One of the main areas in which lower courts struggled {{to resolve this issue}} was the use of 911 calls during the course of trial where the <b>caller</b> <b>is</b> not available to testify. This was the factual situation in Davis v. Washington, in which the Court laid out a definition of [...] "testimonial." [...] Other cases have dealt with the issue of the previously common practice of admitting certain types of certified documents under the business records or public records exception to the hearsay rule.|$|E

2500|$|Withholding information, {{a form of}} {{tactical}} deception, can be costly to the deceiver. For example, rhesus monkeys discovering food announce their discoveries by calling on 45% of occasions. Discoverers who fail to call, but are detected with food by other group members, receive significantly more aggression than vocal discoverers. Moreover, silent female discoverers eat significantly less food than vocal females. Presumably because of such costs to deceivers, tactical deception occurs rather rarely. It {{is thought to be}} more common in forms and species where the cost of ignoring the possibly deceptive act is even higher than the cost of believing. For example, tufted capuchin monkeys sometimes emit false alarm calls. The cost of ignoring one of these calls could be death, which may lead to a [...] "better safe than sorry" [...] philosophy even when the <b>caller</b> <b>is</b> a known deceiver.|$|E
2500|$|For {{landline}} telephony, Australia is now geographically {{divided into}} four large areas, most of which cover more than one State and/or Territory. All [...] "Local" [...] telephone numbers within these four areas are of eight digits, consisting (mainly) of a four digit [...] "Exchange" [...] code plus a four digit number. The [...] "National 'Significant' Number" [...] consists of a single digit [...] "Area" [...] code followed by the [...] "Local" [...] eight digit number - a total of nine digits. Within Australia, to access the [...] "Number" [...] of a landline telephone in an [...] "Area" [...] other than that in which the <b>caller</b> <b>is</b> located (including a caller using a [...] "Mobile" [...] 'phone), firstly {{it is necessary to}} dial the Australian [...] "Trunk Access Code" [...] of 0 plus the [...] "Area" [...] code, followed by the [...] "Local" [...] Number. Thus, the [...] "Full National Number" [...] (FNN) has ten digits: 0xxxxxxxxx.|$|E
2500|$|In {{selecting}} Newman as its first-team All-Big Ten quarterback, the AP wrote: [...] "Newman {{was picked}} {{by the majority}} over John White of Purdue for the quarterback post because he undoubtedly was the one big offensive spark that enabled Michigan's comparatively light scoring machine to win {{a share of the}} championship porridge. He {{was one of the best}} passers in the conference and won game after game for the Wolverines with his tosses. Newman was hailed during the season as a second Bennie Friedman." [...] In announcing his choice of Newman, Knute Rockne wrote: [...] "One or the marks of class that distinguishes a star quarterback from an ordinary number <b>caller</b> <b>is</b> to name the right play in the pinches. When this quarterback not only calls the right play, but, as in the case of Newman of Michigan, himself executes forward passes that click for touchdowns, then this quarterback must be classed with the great, although, he is just a sophomore. Newman did just this." [...] Writing for the United Press, Dixon Stewart noted: [...] "Newman's generalship, kicking and passing was responsible for Michigan winning its three hardest conference games. Not since Benny Friedman was at his hey-dey has the Big Ten produced such a quarterback." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1992 AT&T {{introduced}} a 700 number service branded as AT&T EasyReach 700. It allowed subscribers to forward calls to their 700 number to any domestic phone number. It allowed either the caller or the subscriber {{to pay for}} the incoming calls. If the <b>caller</b> <b>was</b> calling from a phone not pre-subscribed to AT&T as its IXC, the <b>caller</b> <b>was</b> required to dial 10-ATT prior to dialing the 700 number. This service has since been discontinued.|$|R

2500|$|Each {{episode of}} PAW Patrol follows {{a similar pattern}} and {{features}} recurring themes. Episodes normally open with a scene depicting the dogs going about their everyday lives, often playing with dog toys or engaging in activities at the local playground. Ryder, a ten-year-old boy, is advised of a problem by receiving a call for help or by witnessing a situation himself. His most frequent <b>caller</b> <b>is</b> an accident-prone marine biologist named Cap'n Turbot, who knows much about Adventure Bay's wildlife. Ryder always alerts the dogs via their blinking pet tags. The team members report to their base, the Lookout, and enter its elevator. Marshall typically arrives last causing a humorous mishap that makes the other dogs laugh as the elevator rises. When they reach the top floor, they arrange themselves in a line. Chase announces that the team is ready for action as Ryder tells the pups what has happened. He chooses {{several members of the}} team, normally two first responders, to help solve whatever problem has emerged. They ride a slide down to their vehicles and complete their mission. When they have finished, Ryder says his catchphrase: [...] "Whenever you're in trouble, just yelp for help!" [...] and congratulates the pups.|$|E

6000|$|... "Suppose {{he calls}} on you to-morrow, and sends up his name with {{a request for}} an interview. You wont know his name; and the first {{question}} you will put to your servant is 'What sort of person is he?' Suppose the servant knows him, and, sharing your professed opinion {{of the meaning of}} the word, replies 'He is a gentleman!' On the strength of that you will order him to be shewn in; and the moment you see him you will feel angry with your servant for deceiving you completely as to the sort of man you were to expect by using the word gentleman in what you call its true sense. Or reverse the case. Suppose the <b>caller</b> <b>is</b> your cousin, Mr. Marmaduke Lind, and your high-principled servant by mistaking the name or how not, causes you to ask the same question with respect to him. The answer will be that Mr. Marmaduke--being a scamp--is not a gentleman. You would be just as completely deceived as in the other case. No, Mr. Lind, you might as well say that this workman of mine is a true lord or a true prince as a true gentleman. A gentleman may be a rogue; and a knifegrinder may be a philosopher and philanthropist. But they dont change their ranks for all that." ...|$|E
