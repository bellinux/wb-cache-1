50|$|At {{the time}} the Ugaritic script was in use (ca. 1300-1190 BCE), Ugarit was at {{the centre of the}} literate world, among Egypt, Anatolia, Cyprus, Crete, and Mesopotamia. Ugaritic {{combined}} the system of the Semitic abjad with cuneiform writing methods (pressing a stylus into clay). However, scholars have searched in vain for graphic prototypes of the Ugaritic letters in Mesopotamian cuneiform. Recently, some have suggested that Ugaritic represents some form of the Proto-Sinaitic alphabet, the letter forms distorted as an adaptation to writing on clay with a stylus. (There may also have been a degree of influence from the poorly understood Byblos syllabary.) It has been proposed in this regard that the two basic shapes in cuneiform, a linear wedge, as in êéÇ, and a <b>corner</b> <b>wedge,</b> as in êéì, may correspond to lines and circles in the linear Semitic alphabets: the three Semitic letters with circles, preserved in the Greek Œò, O and Latin Q, are all made with corner wedges in Ugaritic: êéâ ·π≠, êéì  ï, and êéñ q. Other letters look similar as well: êéÖ h resembles its assumed Greek cognate E, while êéÜ w, êéî p, and êéò Œ∏ are similar to Greek Y, Œ†, and Œ£ turned on their sides. Jared Diamond believes the alphabet was consciously designed, citing as evidence the possibility that the letters with the fewest strokes may have been the most frequent.|$|E
40|$|Description of an {{approximate}} method for predicting {{the pressure in}} the immediate corner region and the shock structure on stream-aligned, sharp-leading-edge, symmetrical corner configurations. The method is basically the two-shock method developed by Charwat and Redekopp (1966), with the additional assumption that the corner fillet shock can be located from the calculated pressure in the corner. Corner pressures are correlated {{over a wide range}} of Mach numbers in air and helium for different <b>corner</b> <b>wedge</b> angles. The shock structure calculated by this method is compared with supersonic and hypersonic data...|$|E
40|$|When a plane moving {{shock wave}} {{encounters}} a sharp compressive corner in a shock tube, regular reflection or Mach reflection occurs, {{depending upon the}} Mach number of the incident shock wave, the <b>corner</b> <b>wedge</b> angle, and the initial thermodynamic state of the gas. These reflections have been investigated theoretically and experimentally by many researchers. Unfortunatedly, however, most of these investigations were done on diatomic gases such as air, oxygen and nitrogen. In the present paper, numerical computation is made for obtaining the quantities of carbondioxide behind incident shock wave {{as well as the}} reflected shock wave from an inclined wall. It is assumed that the vibrational temperature of molecules is in equilibrium with the translational temperature, and some dissociation occurs is instantaneously behind the shock waves. The analytical results taking into account these real gas effects are compared with those in the case of perfect gas...|$|E

The Super Square One and Square Two puzzles have been recently introduced. The Super Square One has two additional layers that can be scrambled and solved independently {{of the rest of the}} puzzle, and the Square Two has extra cuts made to the top and bottom layer, making the edge and <b>corner</b> <b>wedges</b> the same size.|$|R

40|$|We are {{concerned}} with the regularity of solutions of the Lighthill problem for shock diffraction by a convex corned wedge. In this paper, we prove that there is no regular solution that is subsonic up to the <b>wedge</b> <b>corner</b> for potential flow. This indicates that, if the solution is subsonic at the <b>wedge</b> <b>corner,</b> at least a characteristic discontinuity (vortex sheet or entropy wave) is expected to be generated, which is consistent with the experimental and computational results. In order to achieve the non-existence result, a weak maximum principle for the solution is established, and several other mathematical techniques are developed. The methods and techniques developed here are also useful to the other problems with similar difficulties. Comment: 20 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|Results of {{numerical}} {{and analytical}} investigations of inviscid steady supersonic flows in corners formed by intersecting wedges are presented. Despite the {{great number of}} papers dealing with such flows, many features {{of the formation of}} complex systems of spatially interacting shock waves in corner configurations have not been adequately studied. Some of these problems are investigated in the present paper by consideration of the generic corner flows, which are conical and symmetric about the bisector plane of a corner. These flows are numerically calculated by solving three-dimensional steady Euler equations with a marching method. Effects of the angle of inclination of the corner surfaces to the free stream direction, sweep angle of the leading edges and the dihedral angle of the corner are discussed. Transition from regular to irregular reflection of shock waves In the corner flows considered, planar shock waves generated by <b>corner</b> <b>wedges</b> intersect and reflect at the bisector plane. Both regular reflection (RR) and irregular (IR) or Mach reflection (MR) of these shock waves are possible [1 - 7]. It is very important, both for theory and applications, to determine the boundaries of domains of the regular and irregular reflections. In particular, this problem for the case of conical flows in corners was considered i...|$|R
30|$|Between {{the island}} arc Moho and subducting oceanic crust (mantle wedge), a northward dipping low-velocity anomaly {{represented}} as a negative amplitude is imaged by the receiver function (LV 2 in Figure¬† 4 f). Due to the shallower extension of this low-velocity anomaly parallel to the dip direction of the oceanic crust, the island arc Moho shows a raised structure near the mantle <b>wedge</b> <b>corner</b> between X[*]=[*]- 10 ¬†km and X[*]=[*] 10 ¬†km. We interpret this low-velocity anomaly in the mantle wedge {{to be due to}} a partial serpentinization of dry olivine (e.g., Pommier 2014). Indeed, a recent study using a dense seismic array on the western Kii Peninsula (Saiga et al. 2013) identified a 1 - to 15 -km-thick layer of seismic anisotropy in the mantle wedge, interpreted to be a serpentinized layer parallel to the dip direction of the plate interface. The serpentinization in the mantle might be caused by partial leakage of water into the mantle <b>wedge</b> <b>corner</b> released by dehydration associated with the formation of eclogite from basalt at depths greater than 50 ¬†km (Figure¬† 5). Although it is difficult to identify the precise location of the toe of the mantle <b>wedge</b> <b>corner</b> (X[*]=[*] 10 to 30 ¬†km), both the receiver function and the seismic tomography suggest that there is a gradual transition from crustal to mantle material therein.|$|R

These physical sources are used to reconstruct without a priori assumptions the most probable position and shape of the true geophysical buried sources, by determining the location of their centres and critical points of their boundaries, as <b>corners,</b> <b>wedges</b> and vertices. This theory, then, is adapted to the geoelectrical, gravity and self potential methods. A few synthetic examples using simple geometries and three field examples are discussed in order to demonstrate the notably enhanced resolution power of the new approach. At first, the application to a field example related to a dipole‚Äìdipole geoelectrical survey carried out in the archaeological park of Pompei is presented. The survey was finalised to recognize remains of the ancient Roman urban network including roads, squares and buildings, which were buried under the thick pyroclastic cover fallen during the 79 AD Vesuvius eruption. The revealed anomaly structures are ascribed to wellpreserved remnants of some aligned walls of Roman edifices, buried and partially destroyed by the 79 AD Vesuvius pyroclastic fall. Then, a field example related to a gravity survey carried out in the volcanic area of Mount Etna (Sicily, Italy) is presented, aimed at imaging as accurately as possible the differential mass density structure within the first few km of depth inside the volcanic apparatus. An assemblage of vertical prismatic blocks appears to be the most probable gravity model of the Etna apparatus within the first 5 km of depth below sea level. Finally, an experimental SP dataset collected in the Mt.

40|$|We {{present a}} series of 2 -D {{numerical}} models of viscous flow in the mantle wedge induced by a subducting lithospheric plate. We use a kinematically defined slab geometry approximating the subduction of the Philippine Sea plate beneath Eurasia. Through finite element modelling we explore the effects of different rheological and thermal constraints (e. g. a low-viscosity region in the <b>wedge</b> <b>corner,</b> power law versus Newtonian rheology, the inclusion of thermal buoyancy forces and a temperature-dependent viscosity law) on the velocity and finite strain field in the mantle wedge. From the numerical flow models we construct models of anisotropy in the wedge by calculating {{the evolution of the}} finite strain ellipse and combining its geometry with appropriate elastic constants for effective transversely isotropic mantle material. We then predict shear wave splitting for stations located above the model domain using expressions derived from anisotropic perturbation theory, and compare the predictions to ‚àº 500 previously published shear wave splitting measurements from seventeen stations of the broad-band F-net array located in southwestern Japan. Although the use of different model parameters can have a substantial effect on the character of the finite strain field, the effect on the average predicted splitting parameters is small. However, the variations with backazimuth and ray parameter of individual splitting intensity measurements at a given station for different models are often different, and rigorous analysis of details in the splitting patterns allows us to discriminate among different rheological models for flow in the mantle wedge. The splitting observed in southwestern Japan agrees well with the predictions of trench-perpendicular flow in the mantle wedge along with B-type olivine fabric dominating in a region from the <b>wedge</b> <b>corner</b> to about 125 km from the trench...|$|R
