5|$|In January 2006, Flying Scotsman duly {{entered the}} National Railway Museum's {{workshops}} {{for a major}} overhaul to return it to Gresley's original specification and to renew its boiler certificate. It was initially estimated that this would only take one year, and cost around £750,000. The bay in which the locomotive was being refurbished was on view to visitors to the NRM but the engine was rapidly dismantled {{to such an extent}} that the running plate was the only component recognisable to the <b>casual</b> <b>observer.</b>|$|E
5|$|Approximately once a decade, a comet becomes {{bright enough}} to be noticed by a <b>casual</b> <b>observer,</b> leading such comets to be {{designated}} as great comets. Predicting whether a comet will become a great comet is notoriously difficult, as many factors may cause a comet's brightness to depart drastically from predictions. Broadly speaking, if a comet has a large and active nucleus, will pass close to the Sun, and is not obscured by the Sun {{as seen from the}} Earth when at its brightest, it has a chance of becoming a great comet. However, Comet Kohoutek in 1973 fulfilled all the criteria and was expected to become spectacular but failed to do so. Comet West, which appeared three years later, had much lower expectations but became an extremely impressive comet.|$|E
5|$|On 13 June 1905, a {{passenger}} service {{began on the}} short branch to South Acton. A short fifth platform for the single car train of the South Acton branch was provided {{to the north of}} the eastbound island platform. At first the service ran to Hounslow West and to Uxbridge but it was later reduced to a shuttle between Acton Town and South Acton on 15 February 1932. The South Acton branch was closed on 28 February 1959 due to low usage; its platform at Acton Town has not been removed and is still visible. The platform is hidden behind advertising hoardings and not obvious to the <b>casual</b> <b>observer.</b> Much of the branch remains including a bridge support on the south side of Bollo Lane. In the picture, the area behind the hoarding in the background is the location of the former branch platform (Platform 5) which was only ever very short, two carriages at most.|$|E

5|$|Confusion {{with the}} highly {{regarded}} miller or sweetbread mushroom (Clitopilus prunulus) {{is a common}} cause of poisoning in France; the latter fungus has a greyish-white downy cap and whitish decurrent gills which turn pink with maturity. Young fruit bodies of Entoloma sinuatum can also be confused with St George's mushroom (Calocybe gambosa), although the gills of the latter are crowded and cream in colour, and the clouded agaric (Clitocybe nebularis), which has whitish decurrent gills and an unusual odour. To complicate matters, it often grows near these edible species. Its overall size and shape resemble members of the genus Tricholoma, although the spore colour (white in Tricholoma, pinkish in Entoloma) and shape (angular in Entoloma) help distinguish it. The rare and edible all-white dovelike tricholoma (T.columbetta) has a satiny cap and stem and a faint, not mealy, odour. E.sinuatum may be confused with Clitocybe multiceps in the Pacific Northwest of North America, although the latter has white spores and generally grows in clumps. A <b>casual</b> <b>observer</b> may mistake it for an edible field mushroom (Agaricus campestris), but this species has a ring on the stipe, pink gills that become chocolate-brown in maturity, and a dark brown spore print. The poorly known North American species E. albidum resembles E.sinuatum but is likewise poisonous.|$|E
25|$|Carnivorous plants {{exist between}} these two extremes: the less {{limiting}} light and water are, and the more limiting soil nutrients are, the higher the optimum investment in carnivory, and hence the more obvious the adaptations will be to the <b>casual</b> <b>observer.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{recent years}} {{many of the}} younger {{generation}} of secular Jews have moved away from the crowded city center. There has also been small but steady growth of Orthodox satellite communities in suburbs such as Edegem, Wilrijk and Brasschaat.

25|$|Carnivory rarely pays, so even {{carnivorous}} plants {{avoid it}} {{when there is}} too little light or an easier source of nutrients, and they use as few carnivorous features as are required {{at a given time}} or for a given prey item. There are very few habitats stressful enough to make investing biomass and energy in trigger hairs and enzymes worthwhile. Many plants occasionally benefit from animal protein rotting on their leaves, but carnivory that is obvious enough for the <b>casual</b> <b>observer</b> to notice is rare.|$|E
25|$|A {{method of}} helical {{broaching}} {{was developed in}} the 2010s that shortens the toolpath of tapping. To a <b>casual</b> <b>observer</b> (without slow motion), it looks rather similar to traditional tapping but with faster movement {{into and out of the}} hole. It uses a specific tool geometry and toolpath to position rapidly, broach the thread in a single half-turn, and then retract rapidly, shortening the cycle time and consuming less energy. It reduces the cost of threading for any holes that can safely allow the two small fast-helix grooves that it leaves behind along with the thread, which could be true in many applications.|$|E
25|$|Another stylistic choice {{she makes}} is {{frequently}} beginning with an epigraph from the written {{records of the}} long assault on Native Peoples. Often she uses this epigraph from the historical, archeological world, as a jumping off point for her poetry which is narrated by a Native-identified voice, allowing for the reader to draw {{the connection between the}} two. This juxtaposition brings the “historical artifact” of bone or cloth to life and we can see the skin being literally ripped away with the language of the poetry and giving the <b>casual</b> <b>observer</b> a real vision of that object.|$|E

25|$|But {{despite their}} success, other units' actions during the Battle of the Bulge {{received}} much greater {{attention from the}} press. This was due in part because during early December 1944, Bastogne was a rest and recreation area for many war correspondents. The rapid advance by the German forces {{that resulted in the}} town being surrounded, the spectacular resupply operations via parachute and glider, along with the fast action of General Patton’s Third U.S. Army, all captured the public's imagination and were featured in newspaper articles and on radio. But there were no correspondents in the area of Saint-Vith, Elsenborn or Monschau. The static, stubborn resistance of troops in the north, who refused to yield their ground in the cold snow and freezing rain despite the heavy German attacks, didn't get a <b>casual</b> <b>observer</b> excited. The image of supply troops trying to bring and ammunition and cold food, crawling through mud and snow, to front-line troops dug into frozen foxholes around Montjoie, Elsenborn and Butgenbach was not exciting news.|$|E
25|$|Omitted from {{mainstream}} histories of American painting, Anderson’s work {{has not received}} sufficient critical attention, perhaps because he chose {{to live in a}} small Southern town, patiently acquiring what he called “definite knowledge” of local forms. Fiercely independent in spirit, indifferent to his own “career,” Anderson did nothing to cultivate fame or critical attention and sometimes seemed to flee them. When the Brooklyn Museum invited him to an exhibition of his linoleum block prints in 1948, he chose instead to travel to China, where he hoped to gaze upon unknown landscapes and examine Tibetan murals (the China trip ended, deep inland, when his passport and other belongings were stolen and Anderson returned, partly on foot, to his point of departure in Hong Kong.) Anderson’s painting– a search for the spiritual and transcendent in the forms of the natural world – thrived on his love of limits, and the overwhelming majority of his best watercolors, undated and unsigned, were done on 8.5 x 11 typing paper with little thought for posterity. Rarely did he sign and date them. For him, painting was simply a way of turning art and nature into “a single thing,” helping the natural world “realize” itself through the artist’s intervention “Order is here,” he wrote of Horn Island, “but it needs realizing,” and to him “realization”—a term which he seems to have borrowed from Cézanne, one of his favorite painters, and adapted to his own use—meant discovering and giving memorable form to unities missed by the <b>casual</b> <b>observer.</b>|$|E
500|$|Originally, the Martins and Coburns each owned a {{five percent}} share in Love the Chase through the Blinkers On Racing Stable syndicate. When Blinkers On Racing Stable {{dissolved}} the Love the Chase syndicate, both shareholders {{wanted to buy}} the filly, so they formed a partnership and paid $8,000 for her. A <b>casual</b> <b>observer,</b> knowing Love the Chase's modest race record, remarked that only a [...] "dumb ass" [...] would buy her, so Coburn and Martin named their racing operation DAP Racing, for [...] "Dumb Ass Partners".

500|$|Locking looks {{similar to}} popping, {{and the two}} are {{frequently}} confused by the <b>casual</b> <b>observer.</b> In locking, dancers hold their positions longer. The lock is the primary move used in locking. It is [...] "similar to a freeze or a sudden pause." [...] A locker's dancing is characterized by frequently locking in place and after a brief freeze moving again. According to Dance Spirit magazine, a dancer cannot perform both locking and popping simultaneously; thus, it is incorrect to call locking [...] "pop-locking". While both styles originate in Los Angeles, locking and popping are two distinct funk styles with their own histories, their own set of dance moves, their own pioneers, and their own competition categories. Locking is more playful and character-driven, whereas popping is more illusory. In popping, dancers push the boundaries of {{what they can do}} with their bodies. Locking has specific dance moves that distinguish it from popping and other funk styles. In the 2006 book Total Chaos, hip-hop historian Jorge [...] "Popmaster Fabel" [...] Pabon lists some of these moves which include [...] "the lock, points, skeeter , scooby doos, stop 'n go, which-away, and the fancies." [...] In addition, Lockers commonly use a distinctive dress style, such as colorful clothing with stripes and suspenders.|$|E

2500|$|To the <b>casual</b> <b>observer,</b> {{the major}} {{distinguishing}} feature of an English saddle is its flatter appearance, {{the lack of}} a horn, and the self-padding design of the panels: a pair of pads attached to the underside of the seat and filled with wool, foam, or air.

2500|$|Rowland {{volunteered for}} the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. She served as a nurse at Camp Winder Hospital in Richmond, Virginia. On 4 April 1865, after the Confederate {{government}} abandoned Richmond, Rowland, then a matron at the Marine Hospital (also known as the Naval Hospital), sang “patriotic songs” to hospitalized soldiers. She described the scene in her diary as [...] "overflowing with merriment," [...] in which a <b>casual</b> <b>observer</b> would “hardly realize we were all prisoners” of the Union. Both of Rowland's brothers, Thomas Rowland (18421874) and John Thomson Mason (18441901), served in the Confederate States Army.|$|E
50|$|Another {{benefit of}} the {{technique}} is its psychological effects upon outside, <b>casual</b> <b>observers.</b> When the proposals being discussed are complicated, the responding party can merely act as if the misinterpretation was what was agreed on. After this impression is instilled in <b>casual</b> <b>observers,</b> attempts to explain the errors of the perceived agreement can be portrayed as attempts to renege on the agreement. Even if the impression {{that there has been}} an agreement is not achieved, the impression that the misinterpretation was the correct interpretation is still powerful, as any attempt to explain the errors of the misinterpretation can be portrayed as being a retraction of the proposal, thereby allowing the responding party to call into question the sincerity of the proposing party. This benefit is often exploited by governments, corporations, and powerful individuals since they are often able to influence journalists, thereby controlling the public's perception of the negotiations taking place.|$|R
