50|$|Introduction - Magnetic {{particle}} clutches {{are unique}} in their design, from other electro-mechanical clutches {{because of the}} wide operating torque range available. Like a standard, single face <b>clutch,</b> <b>torque</b> to voltage is almost linear. However, in a magnetic particle <b>clutch</b> <b>torque</b> can be controlled very accurately. This makes these units ideally suited for tension control applications, such as wire winding, foil, film, and tape tension control. Because of their fast response, {{they can also be}} used in high cycle application, such as card readers, sorting machines, and labeling equipment.|$|E
50|$|This clutch {{is a form}} {{of powder}} <b>clutch.</b> <b>Torque</b> is {{transmitted}} mechanically, through a metal powder filling. In the magnetically controlled version, an applied magnetic field is used to lock the particles in place. Unlike a pure magnetic coupling though, this field takes no part in transmitting torque magnetically.|$|E
5000|$|The B11S {{features}} a 3.0 L flat-6 twin-turbo engine with a peak output of [...] at 6,400 RPM and 550 Nm from 3,600 to 4,800 RPM. The 5-speed automatic transmission features Subaru's [...] "Variable Torque Distribution" [...] system, where the torque split between {{front and rear}} axles is distributed by a center differential and electronically-controlled <b>clutch.</b> <b>Torque</b> is split 35% {{to the front and}} 65% to the rear under normal driving conditions.|$|E
50|$|Early {{semi-automatic}} systems used {{a variety}} of mechanical and hydraulic systems—including centrifugal <b>clutches,</b> <b>torque</b> converters, electro-mechanical (and even electrostatic) and servo/solenoid controlled clutches—and control schemes—automatic declutching when moving the gearstick, pre-selector controls, centrifugal clutches with drum-sequential shift requiring the driver to lift the throttle for a successful shift, etc.—and some were little more than regular lock-up torque converter automatics with manual gear selection.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the complex results concerning the prototype clutch with magnetorheological (MR) fluid. The obtained characteristics depicts the dependencies between the <b>clutch’s</b> <b>torque</b> and: {{the intensity of}} the magnetic field induced by the coil current, as well as the rotational speed of the rotor, and the temperature of the fluid during exploitation. The research was conducted on the dedicated laboratory stand. The detailed analysis of the results is provided in the article...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} a new Modelica library to model vehicle power trains is discussed. An {{overview}} of the elements within the library is given, such as planetary gearsets, laminar <b>clutches,</b> <b>torque</b> losses, driver, warm up model. The library is demonstrated through the discussion of two illustrative examples, for drive cycle fuel consumption prediction and for investigating gearshift transition dynamics of an automatic gearbox. Together with the Modelica simulation environment Dymola, this library is suited and used for HIL (Hardware-In-the-Loop) simulations...|$|R
50|$|Both {{variants}} {{of the design}} (DB 690 'CargoSprinter' and DB 691 'Talion') are five-car trains, with a control cabin at either end. The end cars are powered, with the inner axles individually driven by Volvo engines (6 cylinder, 265 kW @ 2050rpm, emissions to Euro stage II standards). The transmission system uses a (5-speed) mechanical gearbox with <b>clutch,</b> <b>torque</b> converter, and retarder. Fuel capacity is 700l. All the traction equipment is located below the cargo floor level.|$|E
50|$|However, heat {{proved to}} be a {{persistent}} issue. Excessive heat buildup would burn out the new clutch material. To solve the problem, engineers studied the clutch's torque capacity. It was determined that excessive heat buildup was caused by inadequate <b>clutch</b> <b>torque</b> capacity. Engineers increased the system's capacity and equipped a fleet of test vehicles, which they took to the Anza-Borrego desert in southern California. They made a total of 11 trips, subjecting the prototypes to heat, mountain driving, and deep sand with the intelligent multi-disc clutches being called upon for almost continuous delivery of torque. At first, the environment quickly burned out the clutches. But as engineers gained knowledge, the clutches improved. Eventually, the engineers were able to improve the clutch packs enough that the test vehicles could be virtually destroyed from hard off road use, but the clutch packs would still look good.|$|E
5000|$|The clutch {{experiences}} {{most of its}} wear {{in first}} gear because moving the car from a standstill involves {{a great deal of}} friction at the clutch. When accelerating from a standstill on an incline, this problem is made worse because the amount of work needed to overcome the acceleration of gravity causes the clutch to heat up considerably more. For this reason, stop-and-go driving and hills tend to {{have an effect on the}} clutches to a certain degree.Automatic transmissions are better suited for these applications because they have a hydraulic torque converter which is externally cooled, unlike a <b>clutch.</b> <b>Torque</b> converters also do not have a friction material that rubs off over time like a clutch. Some automatics even lock the output shaft so that the car cannot roll backwards when beginning to accelerate up an incline. To reduce wear in these applications, some manual transmissions will have a very low, [...] "granny" [...] gear which provides the leverage to move the vehicle easily at very low speeds. This reduces wear at the clutch because the transmission requires less input torque. However, the issue of handling stops on hills is easy to learn.|$|E

50|$|A narrow {{power band}} is often {{compensated}} {{for by a}} power-splitting device such as a <b>clutch</b> or <b>torque</b> converter to efficiently achieve {{a wide range of}} speeds. A continuously variable transmission can also avoid the issues of a narrow power band by keeping the engine running at an optimal speed.|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that the clutch-to-clutch shifts in both planetary-type {{automatic}} transmission and dual clutch transmission {{can be divided into}} four types, which are power-on upshift, power-on downshift, power-off upshift, and power-off downshift. In previous studies, many control methods of clutch-to-clutch shifts are analyzed, but the control flows of the four types are different. In this article, the principle of these shifts is analyzed in detail. The concept of oncoming <b>clutch’s</b> <b>torque</b> ability is proposed. A generic control flow is designed, which divides the shift processes of the four types into the same three phases, and the control algorithm in transmission control unit and the calibration process can be simplified. The powertrain system model and the shift controller are established on MATLAB/Simulink platform. The generic control flow is verified by software-in-the-loop simulations. The simulation results show that the proposed generic control flow can control the four types of shifts properly...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the control of {{automotive}} gearbox based on dry-clutch architecture. Such a system is widely spread as engagement device in Automated Manual Transmissions (AMTs) and Dual-Clutch Transmissions (DCT) to manage the energy flow from the engine to the vehicle wheels. These modern transmissions introduce improvements on shifting quality, fuel consumptions, pollutant emissions at relatively low-cost respect to other automatic transmissions. In particular, the passengers’ comfort and moreover the control action {{with regard to the}} clutch engagement, is strongly influenced by the <b>clutch</b> <b>torque</b> characteristic model implemented in the Transmission Control Unit (TCU). Thus, a phenomenological approach to model the torque transmitted by the specific clutch architecture is a critical matter to design robust engagement control strategies. To this aim the controller performance of an actuated dry clutch by taking into account the uncertainty of the frictional phenomena on the <b>clutch</b> <b>torque</b> characteristic has been investigated in this work. The outcomes of this analysis prove the limits related to poor modelling of the influence of operating variables on the <b>clutch</b> <b>torque,</b> even when advanced control algorithms are implemented in the TCU...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – In this paper, a {{motor control}} {{algorithm}} for performing a mode change without an integrated starter generator (ISG) is suggested for the automatic transmission-based {{hybrid electric vehicle}} (HEV). Dynamic models of the HEV powertrains such as engine, motor, and mode clutch are derived for the transient state during the mode change, and the HEV performance simulator is developed.

In August 2013 Road and Track evaluated a high-end electric motorcycle as faster and better handling than any conventionally powered bike. Electric machines have better 0 to 60 acceleration, since they develop full torque immediately, and without a <b>clutch</b> the <b>torque</b> is instantly available.|$|R
50|$|A typical {{test setup}} {{includes}} a load machine, <b>clutch</b> and <b>torque</b> transducer. An externally applied load {{is used to}} strain, i.e., load, the motor. Using this method, simple characteristics can be directly mechanically acquired and the derived variables calculated. From the input current and input voltage, the absorbed power can also be recorded. Similarly, from the rpm and torque output values, the mechanical power output can be determined, and thus, {{the efficiency of the}} motor.|$|R
50|$|Throughout its production, VW marketed the Beetle with a four-speed manual transmission. From 1961 (and almost {{exclusively}} in Europe), VW offered an optional version of the Saxomat semi-automatic transmission: a regular 4-speed manual transaxle coupled to an electromagnetic clutch with a centrifugal clutch used for idle. Subsequently, (beginning in 1967 in Europe and 1968 in the United States), VW offered an optional semi-automatic transmission (marketed as Automatic Stick Shift and also called AutoStick), which was a 3-speed manual coupled to an electro-pneumatic <b>clutch</b> and <b>torque</b> converter.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Mode {{transitions}} {{are significant}} {{events in the}} oper-ation of series–parallel hybrid electric vehicles (SPHEVs) with a clutch serving as the key enabling actuator element. Due to the friction-induced discontinuity of the <b>clutch</b> <b>torque,</b> seamless transition is difficult to achieve. In this paper, a model reference control (MRC) law is proposed to coordinate the motor torque, engine torque, and <b>clutch</b> <b>torque</b> to manage transitions. The con-trol system is overactuated {{in the sense that}} three inputs (i. e., three torques) can be manipulated to control the two outputs (angular speeds of {{the two sides of the}} clutch). The effects of using differ-ent input combinations are analyzed to exploit the overactuation feature of the system, and performance sensitivities to various de-sign factors are studied. The simulation and experimental results from an SPHEV bus demonstrate that the MRC achieves reduced torque interruption, less vehicle jerk, and smaller frictional losses...|$|E
40|$|This master's thesis {{investigated}} {{the possibility to}} control the <b>clutch</b> <b>torque</b> {{in order to better}} traverse a Scania vehicles powertrain backlash. When traversing a backlash the torque difference between the two gears will at the time of contact excite oscillations in the powertrain, and by controlling the torque these oscillations can be minimized. The master's thesis solves this issue in three major steps. First a Simulink model was created to mimic the actual vehicles powertrain as closely as possible. It was created using mostly Simdriveline components and then validated by comparing simulations to measurements from real drives. After that backlash position and backlash size observers were created in order to estimate them. Using the developed Simulink model these observers could then be evaluated, and the backlash position observer proved to be very precise while the backlash size observer was not as precise but still usable. Finally a control strategy was devised, by using the estimates from the developed observers it was supposed to control the <b>clutch</b> <b>torque</b> in a better way than previously done. The controller was a switching controller that simply used the full engine torque while the backlash was in contact, and a P controller to control the <b>clutch</b> <b>torque</b> while performing a backlash traverse. The controller proved to perform well and was robust to errors in the backlash size. Future work to be done could be to develop a shaft torque observer for use in the already developed observers...|$|E

In addition, the influence of <b>clutch</b> <b>torque</b> on wheelsets is analyzed.|$|E

40|$|The torque {{coordination}} control during mode {{transition is}} a very important task for hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) with a clutch serving as the key enabling actuator element. Poor coordination will deteriorate the drivability of the driver and lead to excessive wearing to the clutch friction plates. In this paper, a novel torque coordination control strategy for a single-shaft parallel hybrid electric vehicle is presented to coordinate the motor torque, engine torque, and <b>clutch</b> <b>torque</b> so that the seamless mode switching can be achieved. Different to the existing model predictive control (MPC) methods, only one model predictive controller is needed and the <b>clutch</b> <b>torque</b> is taken as an optimized variable rather than a known parameter. Furthermore, the successful idea of model reference control (MRC) is also used for reference to generate the set-point signal required by MPC. The parameter sensitivity is studied for better performance of the proposed model predictive controller. The simulation results validate that the proposed novel torque coordination control strategy has less vehicle jerk, less torque interruption, and smaller clutch frictional losses, compared with the baseline method. In addition, the sensitivity and adaptiveness of the proposed novel torque coordination control strategy are evaluated...|$|E

40|$|Automated manual {{transmissions}} {{based on}} dry clutch are wide spreading in modern automotive transmissions {{because of the}} possible improvements in performance and comfort with respect to manual transmissions. A key issue for an efficient control of electro-actuated dry clutch transmissions is {{the knowledge of the}} <b>clutch</b> <b>torque</b> transmitted during the engagement. The torque transmitted by the clutch can be directly measured by means of setups which are difficult to be implemented in commercial products. Therefore it is fundamental to define an accurate torque transmissibility model to be exploited for the estimation of the <b>clutch</b> <b>torque.</b> A possible estimator is based on the inversion of the driveline dynamic model like showed by Gliemo et al. (2006) and by Amari et al. (2009), but the robustness of this type of estimation drastically depends on the availability of the system parameters and on clutch disk acceleration and engine torque measurements. As proposed by Vasca et al. (2008), a possible alternative consists in using an analytical model describing the friction phenomena and providing the torque transmitted by the clutch starting from the throwout bearing position. Unfortunately, the nominal characteristic (torque vs position) is influenced by several variables. Some of them, such as friction pads wear and diaphragm spring fatigue, have a “long term” effect, like showed by Mauro et al. (2002). Other variables have a direct influence also on each engagement maneuver. These variables, such as slipping speed, pressure, slipping acceleration and temperature affect the friction coefficient, as tested by Senatore et al. (2011), Feng et al. (2010) and by LuK (1996), and the normal force (D’Agostino et al., 2012) (Cappetti et al., 2012). The difficulties in representing the contributions of the different variables in the <b>clutch</b> <b>torque</b> transmissibility characteristic lead to the definition of corresponding lumped models, so as in the works of Myklebust et al. (2012; 2013). In this paper a temperature dependent torque transmissibility model for dry clutch transmissions is proposed. The model estimates the <b>clutch</b> <b>torque</b> by considering separately the influence of the slipping speed and temperature on the friction coefficient and the influence of the temperature on the normal force determined by the flat spring. In order to estimate the temperatures of interest, two thermal models of a dry dual clutch transmission with a central disk are proposed. The temperatures estimated by means of the proposed thermal models are then used for the analysis of open loop and closed loop operating conditions in a realistic dry dual clutch transmission...|$|E
