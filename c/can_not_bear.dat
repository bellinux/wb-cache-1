40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{positive}} effect in environmental protection using such Eco labels, there are critics if the environmental benefit gained from the labeling program really exceeds the social cost associated with its implementation. The major source of the cost could be industries’ additional cost burden {{to comply with the}} Eco Labeling requirements (e. g. investment to change product design, manufacturing process, input materials and technologies, compliance verification cost for testing and auditing, license fees to use the ecolabel, etc). Especially for international trade, the manufacturers who try to show their product’ environmental qualities by means of Eco labels in more than one foreign markets <b>can</b> <b>not</b> but <b>bear</b> redundant cost, because each national Eco labeling program has independent, separate and not-harmonized requirements, processes and fee structures. Companies will have to select the most suitable Eco labeling program based on the societal expectations. Major consumer electronics companies (e. g.

Their motives to take on Eco labeling scheme maybe due to improving their business, or just being socially responsible, or both.

60|$|Similar {{objections}} will {{be found}} {{to apply to the}} Method of Concomitant Variations. If the causes which act upon the state of any society produced effects differing from one another in kind; if wealth depended on one cause, peace on another, a third made people virtuous, a fourth intelligent; we might, though unable to sever the causes from one another, refer to each of them that property of the effect which waxed as it waxed, and which waned as it waned. But every attribute of the social body is influenced by innumerable causes; and such is the mutual action of the co-existing elements of society, that whatever affects any one of the more important of them, will by that alone, if it does not affect the others directly, affect them indirectly. The effects, therefore, of different agents not being different in quality, while the quantity of each is the mixed result of all the agents, the variations of the aggregate <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>bear</b> a uniform proportion to those of any one of its component parts.|$|E

60|$|Croesus {{had large}} bodies of horse, while Cyrus had no {{efficient}} troops to oppose them. He {{had a great}} number of camels in the rear of his army, which had been employed as beasts of burden to transport the baggage and stores of the army on their march. Cyrus concluded to make the experiment of opposing these camels to the cavalry. It is frequently said by the ancient historians that the horse has a natural antipathy to the camel, and <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>bear</b> either the smell or the sight of one, though this is not found to be the case at the present day. However the fact might have been in this respect, Cyrus determined to arrange the camels in his front as he advanced into battle. He accordingly ordered the baggage to be removed, and, releasing their ordinary drivers from the charge of them, he assigned each one to the care of a soldier, who was to mount him, armed with a spear. Even if the supposed antipathy of the horse for the camel did not take effect, Cyrus thought that their large and heavy bodies, defended by the spears of their riders, would afford the most effectual means of resistance against the shock of the Lydian squadrons that he was now able to command.|$|E
60|$|If {{population}} {{did increase}} {{with the increase}} of capital and in proportion to it, the fall of profits would still be inevitable. Increased population implies increased demand for agricultural produce. In the absence of industrial improvements, this demand can only be supplied at an increased cost of production, either by cultivating worse land, or by a more elaborate and costly cultivation of the land already under tillage. The cost of the laborer’s subsistence is therefore increased, and, unless the laborer submits to a deterioration of his condition, profits must fall. In an old country like England, if, in addition to supposing all improvement in domestic agriculture suspended, we suppose that there is no increased production in foreign countries for the English market, the fall of profits would be very rapid. If both these avenues to an increased supply of food were closed, and population continued to increase, as it is said to do, at the rate of a thousand a day, all waste land which admits of cultivation in the existing state of knowledge would soon be cultivated, and the cost of production and price of food would be so increased that, if the laborers received the increased money wages necessary to compensate for their increased expenses, profits would very soon reach the minimum. The fall of profits would be retarded if money wages did not rise, or rose in a less degree; but the margin which can be gained by a deterioration of the laborers’ condition is a very narrow one: in general, they <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>bear</b> much reduction; when they can, they have also a higher standard of necessary requirements, and will not. On the whole, therefore, we may assume that in such a country as England, if the present annual amount of savings were to continue, without any of the counteracting circumstances which now keep in check the natural influence of those savings in reducing profit, the rate of profit would speedily attain the minimum, and all further accumulation of capital would for the present cease.|$|E
