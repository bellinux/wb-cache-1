30|$|One of the {{limitations}} of present study is that only regular resin cement was tested and this could affect the results since the etch-rinse and gently drying of root canal is inherent of this technique. Knowing that this step could be suppressed in clinical practice makes the question about a cleaning protocol for root canals walls even more relevant and needed to be further improved for a better removal of the lubricant from canal walls. The comparison with self-adhesive resin cement [28] could be important since this cement does not require etch-and-rinse steps and consequently a real role of cleaning protocol could be tested in future studies. Another limitation of this study is the absence of a <b>consolidated</b> <b>protocol</b> for removal of lubricant substances from root canal walls such as petroleum jelly that is insoluble in water.|$|E

There is thus {{a need for a}} dynamic negotiation protocol for the efficient support of heterogeneous services and pricing strategies that will exist in the Grid. We have proposed novel augmentations to existing service negotiation protocols in the areas of scalability, flexibility, support for distinct services and negotiation with several service providers simultaneously. The proposed autonomous negotiation protocol is based on a distributed multiagent framework creating an open market for Grid services. We have explained the <b>consolidated</b> <b>protocol</b> for Intra-domain and Inter-domain cases using specific scenarios that involve bi-lateral bargaining. Furthermore, the usefulness of our algorithm is exhibited by a categorical comparison made between the attributes of our protocol with the corresponding attributes of other key protocols in literature.

Either to avoid or decrease postoperative discomfort, dentinal adhesives {{have been used}} to protect the exposed dentine. This technique is called pre-hybridization. Notwithstanding, despite of the clinical use, there still exist controversies on its efficacy and the most adequate material and protocol to execute it. Objective:This review study aimed to discuss the concepts involving the pre-hybridization based on the most important papers published from 2002 to date, indexed at the following databases: SciELO, MEDLINE and Pubmed. Methods: The following keywords were applied in the searching: pre-hybridization, tooth hypersensitivity and their possibilities (e. g. : dentinal pre-hybridization, dentinal hypersensitivity, hypersensitivity treatment). Only review and original research studies were selected. Efforts to identify comparative, controlled clinical studies as well as meta-analysis studies on hypersensitivity and dentinal pre-hybridization were made. Results: Based on the review conducted, it was possible to highlight that the self-conditioning adhesives have been the first choice for pre-hybridizationprocedures.

The representatives decided that NASA Science Internet (NSI) will assume management of both the Space Physics Analysis Network (SPAN) and the NASA Science Network (NSN). SPAN {{is now known as}} the NSI/DECnet, and NSN is now known as the NSI/IP. Some management functions will be distributed between Ames Research Center (ARC) and Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). NSI at ARC has the lead role for requirements generation and networking engineering. Advanced Applications and the Network Information Center is being developed at GSFC. GSFC will lead the NSI User Services, but NSI at Ames will continue to provide the User Services during the transition. The transition will be made as transparent as possible for the users. DECnet service will continue, but is now directly managed by NSI at Ames. NSI will continue to work closely with routing center managers at other NASA centers, and has formed a transition team to address the change in management. An NSI/DECnet working group had also been formed as a separate engineering group within NSI to plan the transition to Phase 5, DECnet's approach to Open System Integration (OSI).

40|$|The {{common goal}} for {{structural}} genomic centers and consortiums is to decipher {{as quickly as}} possible the three-dimensional structures for a multitude of recombinant proteins derived from known genomic sequences. Since X-ray crystallography is the foremost method to acquire atomic resolution for macromolecules, the limiting step is obtaining protein crystals that can be useful of structure determination. High-throughput methods have been developed in recent years to clone, express, purify, crystallize and determine the three-dimensional structure of a protein gene product rapidly using automated devices, commercialized kits and <b>consolidated</b> <b>protocols.</b> However, the average number of protein structures obtained for most structural genomic groups has been very low compared to the total number of proteins purified. As more entire genomic sequences are obtained for different organisms from the three kingdoms of life, only the proteins that can be crystallized and whose structures can be obtained easily are studied. Consequently, an astonishing number of genomic proteins remain unexamined. In the era of high-throughput processes, traditional methods in molecular biology, protein chemistry and crystallization are eclipsed by automation and pipeline practices. The necessity for high rate production of protein crystals and structures has prevented the usage of more intellectual strategies and creative approaches in experimental executions. Fundamental principles and personal experiences in protein chemistry and crystallization are minimally exploited only to obtain "low-hanging fruit" protein structures. We review the practical aspects of today s high-throughput manipulations and discuss the challenges in fast pace protein crystallization and tools for crystallography. Structural genomic pipelines can be improved with information gained from low-throughput tactics that may help us reach the higher-bearing fruits.

40|$|The goal of {{this pilot}} study {{was to assess the}} {{logistics}} and feasibility of performing simultaneous 18 -fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/MRI in 20 patients with myocardial infarction. Ten patients also underwent PET/CT studies before PET/MRI. PET/MRI was successfully performed in 19 of 20 patients (1 patient did not tolerate the procedure because of claustrophobia). Patient exit interviews revealed long examination times, patient preparation, noise, narrowness, immobility, and need for fasting as the major sources of discomfort. The total cumulative PET/MRI time (without patient preparation and positioning) was about 1 hour. Excellent agreement was observed between PET- and MRI-based late gadolinium-enhanced images for depicting infarcted myocardial segments. No significant differences in myocardial tracer uptake between PET/CT and PET/MRI images were noted. The investigators concluded that although hybrid cardiac imaging with FDG PET with an integrated whole-body 3 -T MRI system is feasible, <b>consolidated</b> imaging <b>protocols</b> will need to be devised to enhance patient comfort. Viewpoint Hybrid PET/MRI systems are now available on the market. [1, 2] PET/MRI systems may provide certain competitive advantages over PET/CT in various clinical settings. [3...|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores how {{medicine}} is practiced in a paediatric HIV clinic in outer London. It draws on ethnographic research {{that took place}} in the clinic over the course of a year. The significance of the topic is situated in the complexity of the issues presented clinically by children with HIV in London. During practice recurrent associations of confidentiality, stigma, vulnerability, naivety and innocence emerges around the patient cohort that mainly comprises recent African migrants living their lives in complicated urban environments. These associations are contrasted by the uncompromising requirements of antiretroviral medicine which needs almost perfect dosing adherence in order to suppress the virus. The incompatibilities between complex patient lives and medical requirements must be made compatible through clinical practice. Therefore, the thesis emphasises the clinic as the key site where the ‘cultural’ issues presented by patients are consolidated with drug requirements to form a functional medicine. The argument is informed by discussions around Science and Technology Studies (STS), and the Sociology of Childhood (SoC). These discussions highlight practice as ‘enacted’, where objects such as disease, the body or medicine are not ‘given’ but gain their shape through their recurrent enactions (Mol 2002, Mol and Law 2004). I have used these discussions to argue that medicine and protocol do not pre-exist practice but must be enacted by practitioners and (child) patients in the clinic. Clinical practice is shown in the thesis as <b>consolidating</b> <b>protocol,</b> drug requirements, patients, practitioners and representations of HIV in ongoing clinical enactions to make the antiretroviral medicine amongst the paediatric cohort operational. To do this, the research focuses on a set of procedures enacted in the clinic: disclosure, adherence, HIV as chronic illness and transition. These procedures inform practitioners on how to maintain care and make medical requirements explicit to child patients (and their parents), enforcing behaviour that accords with the goals of antiretroviral medicine. In this way practice and protocol are negotiated and renegotiated to ensure their effectiveness between all of the associations involved in participating with the condition, paediatric HIV and the corresponding medicine. Compared to existing STS on the subject of medicine and the clinic, paediatric HIV practice emphasises the clinic’s role to consolidate seemingly incompatible associations around patients such as stigma, vulnerability and innocence into medical requirements. The result is that STS that advertently or inadvertently implies that medical practice is messy or disjointed are questioned in light of two important features of paediatric HIV. Firstly, that practice must necessarily consolidate disparate patient lives into medical requirements if treatment is to be successful, and secondly, that practitioners must employ a logic to generate a coherent, well-organised clinical practice that is flexible and pliable to diverse eventualities. The significance of this argument demonstrates the clinic’s importance in enacting interventions and attuning medicine, displacing a notion of protocol or guidelines as dictating practice without negotiation, or the belief that the ideal course of clinical practice is fully predefined in protocol. Therefore, the implications of this research underline the clinic as a key site in rationalising how {{medicine is}} formulated and applied to patients...|$|R
40|$|Background: Muslims are {{required}} to wake up early to pray (Fajr) at dawn (approximately one and one-half hours before sunrise). Some Muslims wake up to pray Fajr and then sleep until {{it is time to}} work (split sleep), whereas others sleep continuously (consolidated sleep) until work time and pray Fajr upon awakening. Aim: To objectively assess sleep architecture and daytime sleepiness in consolidated and split sleep due to the Fajr prayer. Setting and Design: A cross-sectional, single-center observational study in eight healthy male subjects {{with a mean age of}} 32. 0 ± 2. 4 years. Methods: The participants spent three nights in the Sleep Disorders Center (SDC) at King Khalid University Hospital, where they participated in the study, which included (1) a medical checkup and an adaptation night, (2) a consolidated sleep night, and (3) a split-sleep night. Polysomnography (PSG) was conducted in the SDC following the standard protocol. Participants went to bed at 11 : 30 PM and woke up at 7 : 00 AM in the <b>consolidated</b> sleep <b>protocol.</b> In the split-sleep protocol, participants went to bed at 11 : 30 PM, woke up at 3 : 30 AM for 45 minutes, went back to bed at 4 : 15 AM, and finally woke up at 7 : 45 AM. PSG was followed by a multiple sleep latency test to assess the daytime sleepiness of the participants.

40|$|This study {{compared}} {{the impact of}} split and consolidated sleep/wake schedules on subjective sleepiness during the biological day and biological night. This was achieved using a between-group design involving two forced desynchrony protocols: consolidated sleep/wake and split sleep/wake. Both protocols included 7 × 28 -h days with 9. 33 h in bed and 18. 67 h of wake each day. While the <b>consolidated</b> sleep/wake <b>protocol</b> had 1 × 9. 33 -h sleep opportunity and 1 × 18. 67 -h wake period each day, the split sleep/wake protocol had 2 × 4. 67 -h sleep opportunities and 2 × 9. 33 -h wake periods each day. For both protocols, subjective sleepiness was measured using the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale every 2. 5 h during wake. A total of 29 healthy adult males participated, with 13 in the consolidated sleep/wake group (mean age = 22. 5 yrs) and 16 in the split sleep/wake group (mean age = 22. 6 yrs). On average, subjective sleepiness during wake periods of the split condition {{was significantly higher than}} that {{during the first half of}} wake periods of the consolidated condition, but was similar to the level during the second half. These findings were observed for wake periods that occurred during both the biological day and biological night. Previous data have shown that cognitive impairment at night is lower for split schedules than consolidated schedules, but the current data indicate that feelings of sleepiness are greater for split schedules than consolidated schedules for at least half of the time awake. Thus, it should be explained to people operating split sleep/wake schedules that although they may perform well, they are likely to feel sleepy...|$|R
40|$|Finding a new use for {{neglected}} infrastructures, such as disused railways, {{provides an}} opportunity for low carbon travel experiences as reconversion policies promote new uses, arrest decay processes and re-establish continuity in the environmental system, using existing linear infrastructures. Nevertheless, the decision of what {{to do in order to}} reuse abandoned railways represents a complex decision making problem, involving heterogeneous impacts and stakeholders. Within this context, Multi Criteria Analysis techniques can be used to synthesize stakeholders’ preferences by accommodating conflicting and incommensurable impacts. The present study thus uses Multi Criteria Analysis to answer a real demand for transportation systems’ planning coming from the Piedmont Region Authority in Italy, where 12 passenger railway lines have recently been abandoned and replaced by bus services. The main objective of the study is to develop a methodological framework able to support collaborative planning and decision-making processes related to the requalification of disused railways in mixed urban and rural contexts. The ultimate objective is to provide a robust recommendation to the Regional Authority with reference to the best requalification option for the abandoned railway line under analysis. The contribution brought by the study is twofold and refers to: (i) improved operability of the proposed tools obtained by combining visualization analytics with <b>consolidated</b> preference elicitation <b>protocols</b> for assessing multiple impacts and (ii) the provision of a replicable working tool for policy makers. The study has thus an innovative value and may increase the use of Decision Analytics to support the evaluation of environmental impacts of different transportation systems...|$|R
40|$|The local {{varieties}} have {{a multiple}} importance within the Italian grapevine germplasm. This {{is due to}} their ability to determine several typical sensory and hedonistic characteristics of wine as well as to evocate historical and cultural values related to the viticulture. This germplasm includes either the well-known or “major” varieties or the so called “minor” varieties, which characteristics and potentialities are often unknown. The major varieties, represent a solid reference for traditional and famous wine productions, although new knowledge may derive from investigating them by using the newest technologies. As concerns the minor varieties, the knowledge about their true identity, morphology, viticultural performance and oenological potential is still limited and fragmentary. This project funded in 2010 in the frame of the AGER projects devoted to scientific research in agro-food aims at the safeguard and valorization of the Italian grapevine biodiversity, by means of the study {{of a wide range of}} regional varieties and biotypes and the dissemination of the results by utilizing an informative system that allows a straightforward consultation and application by researchers, technicians and operators of the viticulture and the oenological sectors. The project integrates <b>consolidated</b> research <b>protocols</b> and innovative methodologies: ampelographic and phenological studies: according to the minimal list of the European project GrapeGen 06 based on the second edition of the OIV descriptor list for grape varieties and Vitis species; ampelometric measurements by using the SUPERAMPELO software; analysis of the polymorphism of the 9 loci microsatellites indicated in by GenRes 081 and GrapeGen 06 European projects; analysis of the polymorphism of some tri-, tetra- and penta-nucleotides microsatellite loci; analysis of polymorphism of some SNPs; analyses of berry juice composition; investigation on the viticultural performance; compilation of sheets that summarizes the main traits of the varieties. The research proposed in this project is finalized to achieve a complete “characterization” of a great number of Italian regional genotypes and to acquire data useful either for scientific or practical purpose. Approximately 600 accessions which presumably belong to 300 varieties of Vitis vinifera subsp. Sativa have been collected. The accessions are currently grown in extra situ collections, or ‘on farm’, especially in the case of recent recovered accessions, and this has helped to clearly define the exact varietal belonging for each accession, correcting mismatches and mistakes frequently observed in germplasm collections. All data obtained, together with others previously collected by each partner, will be reversed in the “Italian Vitis Database” ([URL] already developed by the University of Pisa, managed by the “Italian Group for a Vitis database” and predisposed to receive and manage a large quantity of information. The access to the database will be free and the information presented to a public level will always be checked and certified by the principal investigator responsible for the single variety or accession and by the scientific committee, to guarantee the highest degree of accuracy. Moreover the database is not just dedicated to researchers, but it is mainly devoted to breeders, vine-growers and wine makers; this is one of the major distinctive traits among others Vitis databases freely available on line, due to the fact that one of the principal aims of this work is to create a link and a flow between research and practice in the field...|$|R
40|$|Neuroplasticity is {{critical}} for learning, memory, and recovery of lost function following neurological insult. Whilst non-invasive brain stimulation techniques capable of inducing these neuroplastic changes within the human cortex could be therapeutically beneficial {{for a range of}} neurological and psychiatric conditions, the short duration, instability, and variability of induced effects limits their therapeutic potential. This thesis has investigated approaches to enhance the duration, stability, and consistency of the neuroplastic response to non-invasive brain stimulation protocols applied to the human primary motor cortex. The neuroplasticity-inducing paradigm employed throughout this thesis was continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) paradigm shown to suppress human motor cortical excitability. Studies in animals have shown the repeated, spaced application of stimulation protocols to prolong the duration of experimentally-induced synaptic plasticity. Therefore, Chapter 2 examined whether the spaced application of repeated cTBS protocols enhanced the lifetime of induced neuroplastic effects within the human primary motor cortex. Whilst the neuroplastic response to a single cTBS protocol was minimal, paired cTBS protocols spaced 10 min apart induced a strong suppression of motor cortical excitability that lasted for at least 2 h. A further set of experiments were performed to determine the possible contribution of the inhibitory motor networks to this enhanced neuroplastic response (Chapter 3). Although paired cTBS reduced the excitability of GABAA-[A- subscript]mediated inhibitory motor networks, this effect was only modest. Also, paired cTBS had no effect on GABAB-[B-subscript] mediated inhibition. These findings suggest that the enhanced neuroplastic response to paired cTBS was likely the result of greater suppression within excitatory motor networks rather than a facilitation of inhibitory motor networks. In addition to prolonging the duration of experimentally-induced synaptic plasticity, the repeated application of stimulation protocols has also been shown to consolidate these plastic changes in animal models, making them resistant to reversal by subsequent behaviourally-relevant physiological activity. In Chapter 4, I investigated whether the neuroplastic response to paired cTBS was similarly resistant to reversal by behavioural engagement of the stimulated motor regions. Whilst a voluntary activation of the targeted hand muscles reversed the neuroplastic response to a single cTBS protocol, the long-lasting neuroplastic response to paired cTBS was resistant to the same reversal effects. These results suggest that, similar to animal models of synaptic plasticity, the neuroplasticity induced by cTBS may be <b>consolidated</b> when repeated <b>protocols</b> are applied in a spaced manner. Although Chapters 2, 3, and 4 show a long-lasting and robust response to repeated cTBS protocols, the neuroplastic response to a single cTBS was highly variable between subjects. This may have been due, in part, to non-optimal stimulation characteristics. Therefore, the experiments described in Chapter 5 compared the efficacy of the standard cTBS paradigm (cTBSstd [std subscript]) to that of a slightly modified variant (cTBSmod [mod subscript]). Compared to cTBSstd [std subscript], cTBSmod- [mod- subscript]induced neuroplasticity was highly consistent between subjects, suggesting that this may be the more effective neuroplasticity-inducing paradigm. This thesis demonstrates approaches for inducing long-lasting neuroplastic changes within the human primary motor cortex. These findings have important implications for the therapeutic application of rTMS. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Adelaide, School of Paediatrics and Reproductive Health, 201...|$|R
