40|$|Consumption is the {{dominant}} component of GNP. A 1 % change in consumption is five {{times the size of}} a 1 % change in investment. This paper investigates whether the behavior ofconsumers is an independent source of macroeconomic fluctuations or whether most disturbances come from other sectors. Informal commentaries on the business cycle put considerable weight on the independent behavior of consumption. It is commonplace to hear of a business revival sparked by consumers. On the other hand, all modern theories of fluctuations make the consumer a reactor to economic events, not a cause of them. Random shocks in technology are generally the driving force in fully articulated models. This paper develops a framework where the distinction between a movement along a <b>consumption</b> <b>schedule</b> and a shift of the schedule is well defined. Application of the framework to twentieth-century American data shows that shifts of the <b>consumption</b> <b>schedule</b> have probably been an important cause of fluctuations but have probably not been {{the dominant}} source of them. I consider three sources of disturbances to the economy: (1) shifts of the consumption schedule; (2) shifts of the schedule relating spending in categories other than consumption and military spending; and (3) shifts in military spending.

30|$|We model {{participating}} consumers’ interactions as {{a repeated}} game [4] {{in which the}} energy consumption game is played repeatedly (e.g., every day). We assume that the energy delivery system is deploying a protocol which is designed by the utility company or a third party aiming to maximize the system efficiency (i.e., the sum utility of the consumers in this paper). Besides designing a smart pricing scheme {{that is based on}} the aggregate usage pattern of the consumers, this protocol designer also constructs a protocol which recommends a set of scheduling actions to consumers based on the past prices, which depend on the history of all the consumers’ energy <b>consumption</b> and <b>scheduling.</b> The protocol designer is only active during the design stage of the protocol and it is passive at run time. In implementing the protocol, the utility company observes every day the (aggregate) energy consumption pattern of the consumer set and based on this performs billing every billing cycle. The consumers use the past prices to determine their future energy <b>consumption</b> <b>scheduling</b> actions in a self-interested and completely decentralized manner. Note that the protocol designer is passive at run time, and hence, it cannot oblige the consumers to follow the recommended energy scheduling. The consumers will only adopt the recommended <b>consumption</b> <b>scheduling</b> if it is in their self-interest to do so, i.e., if they are better off following the recommended protocol rather than deviating from it.

40|$|Abstract—Periods of peak {{consumer}} demand in today’s elec-tricity sector are expensive to satisfy {{and can be}} the source of power failures. One possible solution is the use of demand-side management (DSM) applying dynamic pricing mechanisms. However, instead of reducing peak loads, these mechanisms can lead to peak-shifting due to the herding effect of consumers ’ load-shifting behavior. To overcome this problem, we explore strategies of assigning (non-uniform) participation rates to consumers. We use a generic method to find a near-optimal distribution setting for participation rates. Our method allows DSM designers to tune the system toward consumer convenience. This means less frequent <b>consumption</b> <b>schedule</b> changes, in the price of system performance. In addition, consumers do not need to reveal their detailed consumption schedules (hence, their privacy is preserved). Using experiments, we show the impact of the herding effect and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. We thereby demonstrate price fairness for consumers. Finally, we apply our solution to a more realistic environment – one where consumers change their consumption behavior every day. I...|$|E

Participation decisions are made in real-time on an event-based basis, with every customer that needs to use a flexible appliance considering whether to join the program given current incentives. Customers have different interpretations of the level of risk associated with committing to pass over the control over the <b>consumption</b> <b>schedule</b> of their devices to an operator, and these risk levels are only privately known. The operator maximizes his expected profit of operating the DLS program by posting the right participation incentives for different appliance types, in a publicly available and dynamically updated table. Customers are then faced with the dynamic decision making problem of whether to take the incentives and participate or not. We define an optimization framework to determine the profit-maximizing incentives for the operator. In doing so, we also investigate the utility that the operator expects to gain from recruiting different types of devices.

40|$|Abstract—In recent years, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} deployment of photovoltaic (PV) units and energy storage systems (ESSs) in households. When the energy generated by PV units {{is greater than the}} aggregate load of households and the capacity of ESS, there will be a reverse energy flow from households to the substation. When the reverse energy flow exceeds a certain threshold, it will cause a voltage rise problem, which is a challenge for PV units to be effectively integrated with the distribution network. In this paper, we propose an energy <b>consumption</b> <b>scheduling</b> algorithm, which shifts the deferrable load (e. g., washing machines, dryers) from peak hours (e. g., 7 pm- 10 pm) to high solar radiation hours (e. g., 10 am- 2 pm) in order to jointly shave the peak load and reduce the reverse energy flow. We formulate the energy <b>consumption</b> <b>scheduling</b> problem as a stochastic optimization problem to capture the uncertainty of the amount of PV output power. The objective of our algorithm is to minimize the electricity bill for the household users which have PV units and ESS installed. We use inclining block rate (IBR) pricing and time of use (TOU) pricing to encourage users to shift their load. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm can avoid the voltage rise problem and reduce the peak-to-average ratio (PAR) in the aggregate load. I...|$|R
