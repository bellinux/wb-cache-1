Most callable bonds allow the issuer to repay the bond at par. With some bonds, the issuer has to pay a premium, the so-called <b>call</b> <b>premium.</b> This is mainly the case for high-yield bonds. These have very strict covenants, restricting the issuer in its operations. To be free from these covenants, the issuer can repay the bonds early, but only at a high cost.|$|E

50|$|Today {{the stock}} is trading at $64 making the call option worth $19.45 with a {{theoretical}} <b>call</b> <b>premium</b> now of 45 cents above its in-the-money intrinsic value $19 (the $64 market price minus the call option $45 strike price). The <b>call</b> <b>premium</b> tends to go down as the option gets closer to the call date. And it goes down as the option price rises relative to the stock price, i.e. the 19.45 the option is now worth 30% (19.45/ $64) of the price per PNC shares. In August it was 23% (11.75/$50.65). The lower percentage of the option's price {{is based on the}} stock's price, the more upside the investor has, therefore the investor will pay a premium for it.|$|E

30|$|In {{terms of}} the <b>call</b> option <b>premium,</b> from {{empirical}} data, the premium follows movements in the underlying asset value. Since the <b>call</b> option <b>premium</b> nets the value of outlays for access to a borrower, positive premium movements suggest the level a loan portfolio may expand. Negative movements in the call option indicate the value of outlays in a given period {{is greater than the}} level of expected inflows. Hence, negative <b>call</b> option <b>premiums</b> suggest curtailing or contracting lending activities. For cohort banks, the period from 2008 to 2011 exhibited premiums very close to zero, or negative in value. At this time, the country was experiencing an environment of low interest rates, and even more rapid inflation. In 2012, premiums indicated an expansion in lending for six of the ten subject banks. This general trend in premium growth extends into 2015. Yet, as the premiums suggest banks may lend more, movement in the existing loan portfolio values for many cohorts do not reflect a matching level of growth. It appears, despite indications that more lending may occur, banks in the sample are not offering access to funding commensurate with the <b>call</b> option <b>premium.</b>|$|R

40|$|When a {{corporation}} refunds a bond issue, choices {{have to be}} made between fixed-rate and floating-rate bonds based on expectations of future interest rates. Whether it is financially viable to refund a bond issue depends on many factors, including the magnitude of the decline in interest rates, the <b>call</b> <b>premium,</b> flotation costs, overlapping interest and the corporate tax rate, and all of these factors should be considered in the decision making process. This paper presents a comprehensive quantitative model that will assist the corporation to decide whether to refund and to select the best refunding option.

It deals with bounding relations of <b>call</b> <b>premium</b> applied to generalized options of the convex type, i. e. nonlinear convex options. These relations are obtained from the hypothesis of absence of second-order stochastic dominance between comparable strategies and without any hypothesis on the underlying security's distribution.

40|$|Abstract. In {{a dynamic}} {{framework}} this paper studies how a firm chooses the optimal amount and maturity of its debt. The dynamic debt policy is determined as a trade-off between tax advantages, bankruptcy costs {{and costs of}} recapitalizing the firm. The main contribution {{is to examine the}} optimal debt maturity in a dynamic setting where the firm’s capital is op-timally reorganized following a bankruptcy or when old debt expires. Our results highlight the importance of including debt maturity in the optimal capital structure. We show that firms choose to issue short term debt when restructuring debt is cheap, bankruptcy costs are low, or the uncertainty in the firm’s cash flow is either high or low. We also extend the model to include callable debt. The optimal dynamic capital structure now includes an optimally determined <b>call</b> <b>premium.</b> JEL classification numbers.

40|$|Arbitrage-free price bounds for {{convertible}} bonds are obtained assuming a stochastic volatility {{process for the}} common stock that lies within a band but makes few other assumptions about volatility dynamics. Equity-linked hazard rates, stochastic interest rates and different assumptions about default and recovery behavior are accommodated within this approach. A non-linear multi-factor reduced-form equity-linked default model leads {{to a set of}} non-linear partial differential complementarity equations that are governed by the volatility path. Empirical results focus on call notice period effects, showing that uncertain volatility can capture the call premia so often observed in issuer’s call policies. Increasingly pessimistic values for the issuer’s substitution asset obtain as we introduce more uncertainty during the notice period. Volatility uncertainty is thus a useful mechanism to explain issuers delayed call policies. call notice period, <b>call</b> <b>premium,</b> convertible bond, delayed calls, equity-linked default, stochastic interest rates, volatility uncertainty...|$|E

40|$|The {{prices of}} the option and futures of a stock both reflect the market’s {{expectation}} of futures trends of the stock’s price. Their prices normally align with each other within a limited window. When they do not, arbitrage opportunities arise: an investor who spots the misalignment {{will be able to}} buy (sell) options on one hand, and sell (buy) futures on the other and make risk-free profits. In this paper, we focus on put-callfutures parity arbitrage opportunities. The upper bound of a futures bid price, denoted by Fbt, is given by: Fbte –ra(T–t) ≤ Cat – Pbt + Xe –rb(T–t) + TC (1) Here, T is the expiration date and t is today, i. e. T–t is the remaining time to maturity; Cat is the option’s <b>call</b> <b>premium</b> at the ask, Pbt is the option’s put premium at the bid. X is the exercise price for the option. TC is the transaction cost. ra is the interest rate on the borrowing to finance the futures. rb is the interest rate to lend. If condition (1) is violated then the arbitrageur {{will be able to make}} a risk free profit equal to: Fbte –ra(T–t) – [Cat – Pbt + Xe –rb(T–t) + TC]> 0 (2) When condition (1) is violated, a short arbitrage profit can be realized by shorting futures and protecting it by a synthetic long futures position by (i) buying a call option, (ii) shorting a futures option, and (iii) borrowing the present discounted value of the futures price and lending the same for the exercise price [9].

The focus is on developing the analytical framework for evaluating sovereign debt buyback and swap operations, since very little work has been done in this area.
