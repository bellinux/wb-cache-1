He then tested shear stress versus shear rate of the solution to prove that the solution was a Newtonian fluid. This was done by using a R16 Weissenberg rheogoniometer (a rheogoniometer calibrated to measure specifically the behavior of a viscoelastic polymer solution) for the low range shear stress rates, and the high rates were measured using a <b>capillary</b> <b>rheometer,</b> a device used to measure shear stress rates under high stress. The data proved that there was a linear relationship between shear stress and shear rate with the slope being very close to one, meaning the maltose syrup was indeed a Newtonian fluid. Once 0.08% of the polymer polyacrylamide was added, the flow properties drastically changed. Elastic properties were introduced to the fluid while only a slight amount of shear thinning was observed, small enough to be ignored. The syrup solution had properties very similar to a polymer melt, but there was no shear thinning and the materials could be produced at room temperature.|$|E

The shear stress for all techniques agrees within experimental error at low shear rates. At higher shear rates the slit and capillary measurements diverge from the parallel plate measurements highlighting the effect of pressure and temperature on viscosity. Also, breakdown of the Cox-Merz rule at slightly higher shear rates is apparent when comparing dynamic and steady shear data from the parallel plate experiments. Since the complex viscosity diverges {{in the same manner}} as the viscosity derived from pressure driven flow it seems as if agreement of the complex viscosity with the viscosity derived from pressure driven flow is fortuitous. With the capillary geometry, there is no sign of slip effects at low stress levels probably due to experimental limitations while the torsional rheometer shows slip at all shear stresses. There is no critical stress for the onset of slip but there is a critical stress where slip increases dramatically. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

It was also shown that the elastic swell(B) depended on L/D of capillaries and increased by decreasing die diameter because of the increase in the extensional deformation at the die entrance. The elastic swell decreased with the increase of temperature. tyre tread compound; <b>capillary</b> <b>rheometer...</b>|$|E
40|$|Monitoring the coil-stretch {{transition}} of polymers in transient extensional flow fields provides a unique possibility {{to observe the}} stress distribution between polymer and solvent even for very dilute solutions (with sub-ppm concentrations). It is generally accepted that for concentrations below the critical concentration (c/c* < O(1)) the steric and frictional interactions of neighboring polymer coils are negligible and the rheological response of the fluid is solely governed by the solvent and the weak hydrodynamical interactions of the isolated polymer coil and the solvent. However, this definition of diluteness is only applicable close to the equilibrium state of polymer coils. Especially in extensionally-dominated flow fields, the coil-stretch {{transition of}} a polymer coil leads to an increased interaction volume of the polymer and therefore to polymer-polymer interactions even for concentrations of c/c* < O(1). The term “ultradilute” solution has been introduced recently to describe systems that remain truly dilute even when the polymer chains are in a highly stretched and deformed non-equilibrium state. The <b>Capillary</b> Break-up Extensional <b>Rheometer</b> provides a convenient means for probing chain-chain interactions {{as a function of}} polymer concentration through measurements of the characteristic time-scale of the fluid in a strong extensional flow However, in order to analyze the dynamics of the capillary break-up process it is necessary to answer the question of how much stress is carried by the polymer and how much by the solvent? In other words, under what physical conditions does a coil-stretch transition on the molecular scale occur and affect the resulting macroscopic fluid dynamics so {{that it is possible to}} detect a really “ultradilute” solution? In this paper we will present recent investigations on the capillary break-up behavior of a series of polystyrene solutions with narrowly-distributed molecular weight that are progressively diluted in solvents with different viscosities (Fig. 1). Figure 1. Radius vs. time in a <b>capillary</b> break-up extensional <b>rheometer</b> experiment for solutions of polystyrene (Mw= 1. 9  106 g/mol, Mw/Mn= 1. 03) in styrene oligomers at different concentrations. (end plate diameter 6 mm, initial separation distance 3 mm final distance 10 mm separation time 50 ms). We show that there exists a critical dilution concentration below which the dominant stress resisting breakup is carried solely by the solvent. This observation is supported by numerical simulation of the stress evolution using a multimode FENE-P mode algorithm based on the one-dimensional analysis of Entov and Hinch for transient extensional flows (Fig. 2). Figure 2. Force balance for a collapsing liquid bridge of a dilute polystyrene solution (Mw= 1. 9  106 g/mol, c= 250 ppm, stresses in Pa). The influence of the molar mass as well as a molar mass distribution on the stress evolution and the critical dilution concentration is also discussed. Finally, we consider the influence of the chemical structure of more complex macromolecules as for example cellulose derivatives on the transient extensional flow that arises in <b>capillary</b> break-up <b>rheometers.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Boger fluids are {{characterized}} by their constant viscosity and elasticity and are very useful to study pure elastic flow behavior. In this paper we assess the potential of a microfluidic hyperbolic contraction as a device to measure the relaxation time of low viscosity polymer solutions, which are difficult to characterize in a conventional <b>capillary</b> break-up extensional <b>rheometer.</b> For this purpose we initially characterize the shear and extensional rheology of aqueous solutions of polyacrylamide (PAA) at different concentrations (400, 250, 125 and 50 ppm) with 1 % (w/w) of NaCl, which result in low viscosity Boger fluids. Subsequently, flow visualizations of their flow through a microfluidic hyperbolic contraction were carried out in order to quantify the relation between their degree of elasticity and the vortex growth upstream of the microchannel...|$|R
