40|$|Four {{hexavalent}} and two trivalent chromium compounds {{were tested}} for toxicity and mutagenicity {{by means of}} the Salmonella typhimurium/mammalian-microsome test. All hexavalent compounds yielded a complete inhibition of bacterial growth at doses of 400 to 800 μg/plate, a significant increase of his+ revertant colonies at doses ranging from 10 to 200 μg, and no effect at doses of less than 10 μg. The distinctive sensitivity of the four Salmonella strains tested (TA 1535, TA 1537, TA 98, and TA 100) suggested that hexavalent chromium directly interacts with bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid by causing both frameshift mutations and basepair substitutions. The latter mutations, which are prevalent, are amplified by an error-prone recombinational repair of the damaged deoxyribonucleic acid. On the average, 1 μmol of hexavalent chromium yielded approximately 500 revertants of the TA 100 strain, irrespective of the compound tested (sodium dichromate, calcium chromate, potassium chromate, or chromic acid). The mutagenic potency of the hexavalent metal was not enhanced by adding the microsomal fraction of rat hepatocytes, induced either with sodium barbital or with Aroclor 1254.

There are about one thousand drugs with high or low hepatotoxicity, such as anti-TB drugs. Objective.  In this research we studied the intracellular enzymes activity and bile formation function of the liver in rats of different ages in cases of tuberculostatic (isoniazid and rifampicin) affection and <b>chromium</b> (<b>potassium</b> dichromate) intoxication. Methods. The experimental affection of rats of different ages was performed by combined injection of hexavalent chromium compounds (a solution of potassium dichromate, 3 mg/kg), isoniazid (0. 05 g/kg) and rifampicin (0. 25 g/kg). On the 7 th and 14 th days the rats were injected with enterosorbent Sorbex (150 mg/kg). Enzyme markers activity of the liver was evaluated due to alanine and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT and AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) rates. Bile formation function of the liver was evaluated by total bilirubin and bile acids content in blood. Results. The disorders in hepatocytes plasma membranes permeability were defined by the increased rates of ALT, AST and alkaline phosphatase in blood serum which were decreased in the liver. It was determined that total bilirubin and bile acids content in blood serum of the affected animals increased.

A weaker response {{in the absence of}} microsomal enzymes was observed with hydroxyurea (only at high doses) and the soluble Cr(VI) compounds potassium chromate and potassium dichromate. No effect was observed with ampicillin, cadmium chloride, cyclophosphamide, griseofulvin, the insoluble Cr(VI) compound lead chromate, the soluble Cr(III) compounds chromium nitrate, <b>chromium</b> chloride, <b>chromium</b> <b>potassium</b> sulphate, and the chelating agent sodium nitrilotriacetate.

The miniature ADR is comprised of a fast thermal response <b>Chromium</b> <b>Potassium</b> Alum (CPA) salt pill, two superconducting magnets and unconventionally, a single crystal tungsten magnetoresistive (MR) heat switch. The development of this ADR {{is a result of}} the ongoing development of a continuously operating millikelvin cryocooler (mKCC), which will use only magnetoresistive heat switches. The design and {{performance of}} the MR heat switch developed for the mKCC and used in the miniature ADR is presented in this paper; the heat switch has a measured Residual Resistivity Ratio of 32, 000 ± 3000 and an estimated switching ratio (on thermal conductivity divided by the off thermal conductivity) of 15, 200 at 3. 6 K and 38, 800 at 0. 2 K when using a 3 T magnetic field. The performance of the miniature ADR operating from a 3. 6 K bath is presented, demonstrating that a complete cycle (magnetisation, cooling to the bath and demagnetisation) can be accomplished in 82 s. A magnet current step test, conducted when the ADR is cold and fully demagnetised, has shown the thermal response of the ADR to be sub-second. The measured hold times of the ADR with just parasitic heat load are given, ranging from 3 min at 0. 2 K with 13. 14 μW of parasitics, to 924 min at 3 K with 4. 55 μW of parasitics. The cooling power has been measured for operating temperatures in the range 0. 25 – 3 K by applying an additional heat load to the ADR via a heater, in order to reduce the hold time to 3 min (i. e. approximately double the recycle time); the maximum cooling power of the miniature ADR (in addition to parasitic load) when operating at 250 mK is 20 μW, which increases to 45 μW at 300 mK and continues to increase linearly to nearly 1. 1 mW at 3 K.

40|$|AbstractThe {{design and}} {{performance}} of a fast thermal response miniature (24 mm outer diameter by 30 mm long) <b>Chromium</b> <b>Potassium</b> Alum (CPA) salt pill is described. The need for a fast thermal response {{has been driven by}} the development of a continuously operating millikelvin cryocooler (mKCC) which uses 2 T superconducting magnets that can be ramped to full field in 30 s. The consequence of magnetising and demagnetising the CPA pill {{in such a short time}} is that thermal boundary resistance and eddy current heating have a significant impact on the performance of the pill, which was investigated in detail using modelling. The complete design of a prototype CPA pill is described in this paper, including the methods used to minimise thermal boundary resistance and eddy current heating as well as the manufacturing and assembly processes. The performance of the prototype CPA pill operated from a 3. 6 K bath is presented, demonstrating that a complete CPA cycle (magnetising, cooling to bath and demagnetising) can be accomplished in under 2. 5 min, with magnetisation and demagnetisation taking just 30 s each. The cold finger base temperature of the prototype varies with demagnetisation speed as a consequence of eddy current heating; for a 30 s demagnetisation, a base temperature of 161 mK is obtained, whilst for a 5 min demagnetisation, a base temperature of 149 mK was measured (both from a 3. 6 K and 2 T starting position). The measured hold times of the CPA pill at 200 mK, 300 mK, and 1 K are given, proving that the hold time far exceeds the recycle time and demonstrating the potential for continuous operation when two ADRs are used in a tandem configuration. The ease and speed at which the CPA pill temperature can be changed and controlled when stepping between operating temperatures in the range of 200 mK to 4 K using a servo control program is also shown, once again highlighting the excellent thermal response of the pill. All of the test results are in good agreement with the modelling used to design the CPA pill, giving good confidence in our ability to understand and estimate the effects of eddy current heating and thermal boundary resistance. To conclude, the design for the CPA pill to be used in the mKCC (which is heavily based on the design of the prototype) is presented...|$|R

The XPS results revealed that the intermediate of reducing potassium chromate with hydrogen is trivalent chromium compound; the results of FTIR and XRD indicated that the intermediate mainly consists of Cr(OH) (3) center dot nH(2) O, HCrO 2 and a little amount of KOH or KCrO 2. On the basis of the above analysis of the intermediate, the possible reactions that occurred in the reduction process were suggested. Chromium has various valence {{states and in}} the process of preparing chromium oxides with low valence state of chromium, chromium compounds with different valence state of chromium can usually be produced as intermediates. Due to the difference in property of these intermediates, they always have remarkable influences on the morphological characteristics of the final product.

40|$|At {{ecosystems}} level, environmental parameters such as temperature, pH, {{dissolved oxygen}} concentration and intensity of UV radiation (UVR) {{have an important role}} on the efficiency of organisms’ physiological and behavioral performances and consequently on the capacity of response to contaminants. Insignificant alterations of these parameters may compromise this response. In addition, these parameters can additionally alter chemical compounds by inducing their degradation, producing thereafter other metabolites. Understanding the combined effects of chemicals and environmental parameters is absolutely necessary for an adequate prediction of risk in aquatic environments. According to this scenario, this work aims at studying the combined toxicity of UVR and three xenobiotics: the biocide triclosan (TCS), the metal <b>chromium</b> (as <b>potassium</b> dichromate, PD) and the fungicide prochloraz (PCZ). To achieve this goal zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos (3 h post fertilization (hpf)) were exposed to several concentrations of each chemical combined with different UV intensities; mortality and eggs were recorded every 24 h for the all test duration (96 h). Results showed different response patterns depending on the toxicant, stress levels and duration of exposure. The combination of UVR and TCS indicated a dose ratio deviation where synergism was observed when UVR was the dominant stressor (day 2). The combination of UVR and PD presented a dose level dependency at day 3 indicating antagonism at low stress levels, changing with time where at day 4, a dose ratio deviation showed statistically that synergism occurred at higher PD concentrations. Finally, UVR combined with PCZ indicated a dose ratio at day 3 and dose level deviation at day 4 of exposure, suggesting a synergistic response when PCZ is the dominant stressor in the combination. The obtained results in this study highlighted the importance of taking into account the possible interaction of stressors and time of exposure to better predict environmental risk...|$|R
40|$|Along with cadmium, lead, {{mercury and}} other heavy metals, {{chromium}} {{is an important}} environmental pollutant, mainly concentrated in areas of intense anthropogenic pressure. The effect of potassium dichromate on Lemna minor populations was tested using the growth inhibition test. Cyto-histological and physiological analyses were also conducted to aid in understanding the strategies used by plants during exposure to <b>chromium.</b> Treatment with <b>potassium</b> dichromate caused a reduction in growth rate and frond size in all treated plants and especially at the highest concentrations. At these concentrations the photosynthetic pathway was also altered {{as shown by the}} decrease of maximum quantum yield of photosystem II and the chlorophyll b content and by the chloroplast ultrastructural modifications. Starch storage was also investigated by microscopic observations. It was the highest at the high concentrations of the pollutant. The data suggested a correlation between starch storage and reduced growth; there was greater inhibition of plant growth than inhibition of photosynthesis, resulting in a surplus of carbohydrates that may be stored as starch. The investigation helps to understand the mechanism related to heavy metal tolerance of Lemna minor and supplies information about the behavior of this species widely used as a biomarker...|$|R
40|$|The present work aims {{to compare}} the {{sensitivity}} of embryos and adult zebrafish to <b>chromium</b> (VI) (as <b>potassium</b> dichromate) focusing on biomarkers (cholinesterase, glutathione S-transferase and lactate dehydrogenase) as endpoints. Zebrafish eggs showed less sensitivity to Cr (VI) (96 h-LC(50) = 145. 7 mg/L) than adults (96 h-LC(50) = 39. 4 mg/L) {{probably due to the}} protective action of the chorion. However, biomarkers were much more responsive in larvae than in adults and gave clear indications about Cr (VI) mode of action: it seems to be neurotoxic (inhibited cholinesterase), to inhibit glutathione S-transferase activity and to interfere with cellular metabolic activity (changes in lactate dehydrogenase activity) in larvae. In adults, only glutathione S-transferase was responsive, showing a clear inhibition. The responsiveness of the analyzed biomarkers in larvae reinforces the idea of the usefulness of early life stage assays in the assessment of chemicals effects. Moreover, early life stage assays also contributed with relevant information regarding anomalies in larvae development and behavior. Further research should focus on the use of biomarkers to assess long term effects which are ecologically more relevant. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn in vivo {{study was}} carried out to verify whether extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) has the {{potential}} to modulate alterations resulted from exposure to hexavalent <b>chromium</b> (CrVI) as <b>potassium</b> dichromate in rats. For this purpose, CrVI was injected intraperitoneally (i. p.) at a dose of 0. 4 mg/kg bw/day, EVOO was given orally at a dose of 300 μl daily either a lone or co-treated with CrVI at the same doses, routes and duration (26 days). At the end of the experiment, blood and spleen samples were collected. Genotoxicity, cytotoxicity and immunotoxicity biomarkers induced by CrVI were evaluated. Also, histopathological and immunohistochemical investigations of spleen tissue were conducted. A significant increase in genotoxicity and cytotoxicity biomarkers (micronucleus frequency, 8 -hydroxy- 2 -deoxyguanosine level and lactate dehydrogenase activity) were recorded in CrVI treated rats. In addition, the immunotoxicity biomarkers showed a significant decrease in phagocytic%, stimulated nitric oxide production and decrease in the serum lysozyme activity. Histopathological and immunohistochemical studies support the cytotoxicity study. Oral administration of EVOO can ameliorate those effects but not restored to control level. Thus, authors recommend that regular consumption of this oil in the diet provides a constant supply of potential antioxidants that could reduce these alterations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Four {{samples of}} milled lignite {{used in the}} “Nikola Tesla A ” power plant, located in Obrenovac near Belgrade, were {{subjected}} to a five-step sequential extraction, comprising of the following phases: distilled water, 1 M ammonium acetate, 0. 2 M ammonium oxalate/ 0. 2 M oxalic acid, acidic solution of H 2 O 2 anda 6 Msolution of HCl. The concentrations of the different elements obtained in the extractions were statistically analysed. The majority of the examined elements {{were found to be}} most probably associated with inorganic fractions of lignite, only aluminum, silicon, chromium and arsenic have a larger extractable organic/sulfide fraction than an extractable inorganic fraction. Alumosilicates of magnesium (carriers of arsenic, zinc, lead, copper and <b>chromium),</b> silicates of <b>potassium</b> (scavengers of lead and nickel), mixed aluminates of iron and magnesium (carriers of arsenic, zinc, copper and chromium) and compounds of iron that do not contain aluminum and magnesium (scavengers of manganese) were dissolved in the fifth phase of the sequential extraction. Copper is a substrate of alumosilicates of potassium and magnesium, while zinc and chromium are substrates of compounds of iron leached in the third phase of the sequential extraction. Interphase correlation revealed that the adsorbed and ion-exchangeable fractions of most of the examined elements do not exhibit preferential binding to the components of the inorganic matrix of lignite ash...|$|R
