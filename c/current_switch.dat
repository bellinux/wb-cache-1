50|$|Snubbers are {{frequently}} used in electrical systems with an inductive load where the sudden interruption of current flow {{leads to a}} sharp rise in voltage across the <b>current</b> <b>switching</b> device, in accordance with Faraday's law. This transient can {{be a source of}} electromagnetic interference (EMI) in other circuits. Additionally, if the voltage generated across the device is beyond what the device is intended to tolerate, it may damage or destroy it. The snubber provides a short-term alternative current path around the <b>current</b> <b>switching</b> device so that the inductive element may be discharged more safely and quietly. Inductive elements are often unintentional, but arise from the current loops implied by physical circuitry. While <b>current</b> <b>switching</b> is everywhere, snubbers will generally only be required where a major <b>current</b> path is <b>switched,</b> such as in power supplies. Snubbers are also often used to prevent arcing across the contacts of relays and switches and the electrical interference and welding/sticking of the contacts that can occur (see also arc suppression).|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{theoretical}} approach {{based on an}} interferometer composed by two quantum dots asymmetrically coupled to isolated Majorana quasiparticles (MQPs), lying {{on the edges of}} two topological Kitaev chains, respectively via couplings (t+Δ) and (Δ-t). This setup enables us to probe MQPs in a quite distinct way from the zero-bias peak feature. Most importantly, the system behaves as a <b>current</b> <b>switch</b> made by two distinct paths: (i) for the upper dot connected to both chains, the device perceives both MQPs as an ordinary fermion and the current crosses solely the lower dot, since current in the upper dot is prevented due to the presence of the superconducting gap; and (ii) by suppressing slightly the hybridization of the upper dot with one chain, the current is abruptly switched to flow through this dot, once a trapped electron as a bound state in the continuum (BIC) (Phys. Rev. B 93, 165116 (2016)) appears in the lower dot. Such a <b>current</b> <b>switch</b> between upper and lower dots characterizes the Quantum Phase Transition (QPT) proposed here, being the ratio t/Δ the control parameter of the transition. This QPT is associated with a change from an ordinary fermionic excitation regime to a MQP in the interferometer, which enables not only the fundamental revealing of MQPs, but also yields a <b>current</b> <b>switch</b> assisted by them...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} a {{modeling}} of components and calculation of transient overvoltages that build up on the trans-former primary terminals after the transformer has been switched off by a vacuum circuit breaker (VCB). The transformer is con-nected to the circuit breaker by a cable. The transient overvoltages are calculated for different cable lengths, and the cumulative prob-ability of different arc angles is investigated. In this study two cases are considered: transient overvoltages due to steady-state magnetizing <b>current</b> <b>switching,</b> and transient overvoltages due to inrush <b>current</b> <b>switching.</b> It is shown that the case of inrush <b>current</b> <b>switching</b> is worse, as virtual current chop-ping is possible.

40|$|Thesis (MIng (Computer and Electronic Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 The need to characterise a PEM {{electrolyser}} {{is motivated}} by a South African hydrogen company. One of two electrochemical characterisation methods, namely the current interrupt method or electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, is investigated to characterise the PEM electrolyser. Various literature sources {{can be found on}} the electrochemical characterisation methods. In this study the current interrupt method is used for the electrochemical characterisation of a PEM electrolyser. The current interrupt method is an electrical test method that will be used to obtain an equivalent electric circuit model of the PEM electrolyser. The equivalent electric circuit model relates to various electrochemical characteristics such as the activation losses, the ohmic losses and the concentration losses. Two variants of the current interrupt method, namely the natural voltage response method and the <b>current</b> <b>switching</b> method, are presented. These methods are used to obtain two different equivalent electric circuit models of the PEM electrolyser. The parameters of the first equivalent electric circuit, namely the Randles cell, will be estimated with the natural voltage response method. The parameters of the second equivalent electric circuit, namely the Randles-Warburg cell, will be estimated with the <b>current</b> <b>switching</b> method. Simulation models of the equivalent electric circuits are developed and tested. The simulation models are used to verify and validate the natural voltage response method and the <b>current</b> <b>switching</b> method. The parameters of the Randles cell simulation model is accurately calculated with the natural voltage response method. The parameters of the Randles-Warburg cell simulation model is accurately calculated with the <b>current</b> <b>switching</b> method. The natural voltage response method and the <b>current</b> <b>switching</b> method are also practically implemented. The results is used to indicate the various electrochemical characteristics of the PEM electrolyser. A Nafion 117 type membrane was tested with the current interrupt method. The membrane resistance parameters of Randles cell were estimated with the natural voltage response method. These values are validated with conductivity measurements found in literature.
