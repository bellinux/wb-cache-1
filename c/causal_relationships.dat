5|$|Mu {{waves are}} thought to be {{indicative}} of an infant’s developing ability to imitate. This is important because the ability to imitate plays a vital {{role in the development of}} motor skills, tool use, and understanding causal information through social interaction. Mimicking is integral in the development of social skills and understanding nonverbal cues. <b>Causal</b> <b>relationships</b> can be made through social learning without requiring experience firsthand. In action execution, mu waves are present in both infants and adults before and after the execution of a motor task and its accompanying desynchronization. While executing a goal-oriented action, however, infants exhibit a higher degree of desynchronization than do adults. Just as with an action execution, during action observation infants’ mu waves not only show a desynchronization, but show a desynchronization greater in degree than the one evidenced in adults. This tendency for changes in degree of desynchronization, rather than actual changes in frequency, becomes the measure for mu wave development throughout adulthood, although the most changes take place during the first year of life. Understanding the mechanisms that are shared between action perception and execution in the earliest years of life has implications for language development. Learning and understanding through social interaction comes from imitating movements as well as vowel sounds. Sharing the experience of attending to an object or event with another person can be a powerful force in the development of language.|$|E

40|$|In {{the article}} I propose an {{analysis}} of the Danish causal conjunctions fordi, siden and for based on the framework of Danish Functional Grammar. As conjunctions they relate two clauses, and their semantics have in common that it indicates a <b>causal</b> <b>relationship</b> between the clauses. The causal conjunctions are different as far as their distribution is concerned; siden conjoins a subordinate clause and a main clause, for conjoins two main clauses, and fordi is able to do both. Methodologically I have based my analysis on these distributional properties comparing siden and fordi conjoining a subordinate and a main clause, and comparing for and fordi conjoining two main clauses, following the thesis that they would establish a <b>causal</b> <b>relationship</b> between different kinds of content. My main findings are that fordi establishes a <b>causal</b> <b>relationship</b> between the events referred to by the two clauses, and the whole utterance functions as a statement of this <b>causal</b> <b>relationship.</b> Siden presupposes such a general <b>causal</b> <b>relationship</b> between the two events and puts forward the causing event as a reason for assuming or wishing or ordering the caused event, siden thus establishes a <b>causal</b> <b>relationship</b> between an event and a speech act. For equally presupposes a general <b>causal</b> <b>relationship</b> between two events and it establishes a <b>causal</b> <b>relationship</b> between speech acts, and fordi conjoining two main clauses is able to do this too, but in this position it also maintains its event-relating ability, the interpretation depending on contextual factors...|$|R

25|$|Early {{evidence}} relating tobacco smoking to {{mortality and}} morbidity came from observational studies employing regression analysis. In {{order to reduce}} spurious correlations when analyzing observational data, researchers usually include several variables in their regression models {{in addition to the}} variable of primary interest. For example, suppose we have a regression model in which cigarette smoking is the independent variable of interest, and the dependent variable is lifespan measured in years. Researchers might include socio-economic status as an additional independent variable, to ensure that any observed effect of smoking on lifespan is not due to some effect of education or income. However, it is never possible to include all possible confounding variables in an empirical analysis. For example, a hypothetical gene might increase mortality and also cause people to smoke more. For this reason, randomized controlled trials are often able to generate more compelling evidence of <b>causal</b> <b>relationships</b> than can be obtained using regression analyses of observational data. When controlled experiments are not feasible, variants of regression analysis such as instrumental variables regression may be used to attempt to estimate <b>causal</b> <b>relationships</b> from observational data.|$|E
40|$|This master thesis aims {{to examine}} the {{relationship}} between energy consumption and economic growth and between energy consumption and greenhouse emissions for the EU countries, using a panel time series data from 1996 to 2012 within a multivariate framework for 26 EU countries. The energies are composed from oil consumption, natural gas consumptions, and renewable energies including the biomass as a distinct part. To do that, Unit Root Tests, cointegration test, Pairwise Granger causality tests, and Error Correction Model are employed to find out the type of the <b>causal</b> <b>relationship.</b> The main results to denote are that, there is in the short run, a positive unidirectional <b>causal</b> <b>relationship</b> running from oil consumption to economic growth. We can as well denote a positive bidirectional <b>causal</b> <b>relationship</b> between renewable energies and economic growth and between greenhouse emissions and economic growth. However, there is an unexpected negative bidirectional <b>causal</b> <b>relationship</b> between biomass consumption and gas consumption. From the greenhouse emissions perspective, we can see in the short run, a negative bidirectional <b>causal</b> <b>relationship</b> between greenhouse emissions and renewable energies, and a positive unidirectional <b>causal</b> <b>relationship</b> running from both oil consumption and biomass consumption [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to determine whether the <b>causal</b> <b>relationship</b> between financial development and economic growth in Turkey is stable over time. For this purpose, <b>causal</b> <b>relationship</b> between financial development and economic growth in Turkey has been investigated by means of annual data for the period of 1960 - 2013. Differently from previous studies in the literature, considering that <b>causal</b> <b>relationship</b> between financial development and economic growth might change depending on time, time-varying causality test developed by Balcilar, Ozdemir and Arslanturk (2010) has been used. The results show that there is a unidirectional <b>causal</b> <b>relationship</b> from financial development to economic growth and this relationship changes depending on time. It is seen that unidirectional causality from financial development to economic growth emerged during the periods of financial turmoil and political crisis. The basic conclusion {{is that there is no}} stable <b>causal</b> <b>relationship</b> between financial development and economic growth in Turkey over the given time period...|$|R

25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that people with high EI have greater mental health, job performance, and {{leadership}} skills although no <b>causal</b> <b>relationships</b> have been shown and such findings {{are likely to be}} attributable to general intelligence and specific personality traits rather than emotional intelligence as a construct. For example, Goleman indicated that EI accounted for 67% of the abilities deemed necessary for superior performance in leaders, and mattered twice as much as technical expertise or IQ. Other research finds that the effect of EI on leadership and managerial performance is non-significant when ability and personality are controlled for, and that general intelligence correlates very closely with leadership. Markers of EI and methods of developing it have become more widely coveted in the past decade. In addition, studies have begun to provide evidence to help characterize the neural mechanisms of emotional intelligence.|$|E
25|$|In {{evolutionary}} psychology, {{learning is}} said to be accomplished through evolved capacities, specifically facultative adaptations. Facultative adaptations express themselves differently depending on input from the environment. Sometimes the input comes during development and helps shape that development. For example, migrating birds learn to orient themselves by the stars during a critical period in their maturation. Evolutionary psychologists believe that humans also learn language along an evolved program, also with critical periods. The input can also come during daily tasks, helping the organism cope with changing environmental conditions. For example, animals evolved Pavlovian conditioning in order to solve problems about <b>causal</b> <b>relationships.</b> Animals accomplish learning tasks most easily when those tasks resemble problems that they faced in their evolutionary past, such as a rat learning where to find food or water. Learning capacities sometimes demonstrate differences between the sexes. In many animal species, for example, males can solve spatial problem faster and more accurately than females, due to the effects of male hormones during development. The same might be true of humans.|$|E

Related to these areas of investigation, ontologies of specific interest to {{the philosophy of}} medicine include Cartesian dualism, the monogenetic conception of disease and the conceptualization of 'placebos' and 'placebo effects'.

500|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century the first {{generation}} of German sociologists formally introduced methodological anti-positivism, proposing that research should concentrate on human cultural norms, values, symbols, and social processes viewed from a resolutely subjective perspective. Max Weber argued that sociology may be loosely described as a science as it is able to identify <b>causal</b> <b>relationships</b> of human [...] "social action"—especially among [...] "ideal types", or hypothetical simplifications of complex social phenomena. As a non-positivist, however, Weber sought relationships that are not as [...] "historical, invariant, or generalisable" [...] as those pursued by natural scientists. Fellow German sociologist, Ferdinand Tönnies, theorized on two crucial abstract concepts with his work on [...] "Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft" [...] (lit. community and society). Tönnies marked a sharp line between the realm of concepts and the reality of social action: the first must be treated axiomatically and in a deductive way ("pure sociology"), whereas the second empirically and inductively ("applied sociology").|$|E
500|$|In higher organisms (like people), {{these two}} modes of {{perception}} combine into what Whitehead terms [...] "symbolic reference", which links appearance with causation {{in a process}} that is so automatic that both people and animals have difficulty refraining from it. [...] By way of illustration, Whitehead uses the example of a person's encounter with a chair. [...] An ordinary person looks up, sees a colored shape, and immediately infers that it is a chair. [...] However, an artist, Whitehead supposes, [...] "might not have jumped to the notion of a chair", but instead [...] "might have stopped at the mere contemplation of a beautiful color and a beautiful shape." [...] This is not the normal human reaction; most people place objects in categories by habit and instinct, without even thinking about it. [...] Moreover, animals do the same thing. [...] Using the same example, Whitehead points out that a dog [...] "would have acted immediately on the hypothesis of a chair and would have jumped onto it by way of using it as such." [...] In this way symbolic reference is a fusion of pure sense perceptions {{on the one hand and}} causal relations on the other, and that it is in fact the <b>causal</b> <b>relationships</b> that dominate the more basic mentality (as the dog illustrates), while it is the sense perceptions which indicate a higher grade mentality (as the artist illustrates).|$|E
