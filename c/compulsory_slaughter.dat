40|$|Abstract: Respiratory {{diseases}} {{are one of}} the most important problem in modern, intensive swine production, in the world but also in our country. Intensifying pig production increases frequency and economic importance of this disease, regardless to the measures for its control. Great economic losses are expressed through direct losses due to death and <b>compulsory</b> <b>slaughter,</b> reduced daily gain, a larger feed intake for averige daily gain, prolonged time of fattening, enlarged costs of treatment and a high percentage of light pigs in abattoirs. As a material for research we used the parts of respiratory organs (the lungs and mediastinal lymphonodes) deriving from 125 pigs in total. The evaluation included animals from: 11 industrial swine farms, four medium-sized swine farms, and swine deriving from 17 individual (private) backyards. Bacterial isolation was carried out by aerobic, anaerobic and microaerophyl microorganism cultivation. The identification included determination of their phisiological properties by biochemical characteristics. From the examined samples of respiratory organs, the most frequently were isolated Pasteurella sp. (26. 57 %), E. coli (26. 57 %), Streptococcus sp. (16. 7 %), Staphylococcus sp. (5. 59 %) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4. 90 %). The solitary infective agens from total 72 examined samples was isolated (57. 60 %), while in 53 examined samples (42. 4 %) the presence of mixed infection was detected.

It broke down EU beef sector aid as follows: € 1, 977 million for suckler cow premia (slightly more than in 2001; € 1, 788 million for special premia on steer and bulls, slightly higher than 2001; € 1, 184 million for slaughter premia; € 891 million for extensification premia for the extensive production of 13. 7 million head; € 488 million for export refunds (a decrease from 2001); € 466 million for storage costs of beef bought into intervention; € 390 million for the systematic slaughter of bovines over 30 months old in the UK; € 322 million as additional payments granted by member states in line with their own priorities; € 75 million for <b>compulsory</b> <b>slaughters</b> when BSE cases have been detected. A total budget expenditure of € 7, 581 million in the beef sector for 2002 is anticipated, some 17 % of the total EU agricultural budget. 55 % of beef sector subsidies go to French, German and UK farmers. The Special Purchase Scheme was discontinued in March 2002, after buying 250, 000 tonnes into intervention. Sales out of intervention started {{in the summer of}} 2002 and should total some 50, 000 tonnes by the end of 2002. Under the Agenda 2000 reforms intervention buying has been discontinued as of July 1 st 2002 and {{has been replaced by a}} Private Storage Aid Scheme.

40|$|Special issue: 5 th International Conference on Mycobacterium bovis. [...] HAL Id: hal- 00701898 Despite the <b>compulsory</b> {{test and}} <b>slaughter</b> campaigns in cattle, bovine {{tuberculosis}} (bTB) is still present in Spain, {{and the role}} of wildlife reservoirs is increasingly recognized. We provide an update on recent progress made in bTB control in Spanish wildlife, including aspects of epidemiology, surveillance, host-pathogen interaction and wildlife vaccination. At the high densities and in the particular circumstances of Mediterranean environments, wild ungulates, mainly Eurasian wild boar and red deer, are able to maintain Mycobacterium bovis circulation even in absence of domestic livestock. Infection is widespread among wild ungulates in the south of the country, local infection prevalence being as high as 52 % in wild boar and 27 % in red deer. Risk factors identified include host genetic susceptibility, abundance, spatial aggregation at feeders and waterholes, scavenging, and social behaviour. An increasing trend of bTB compatible lesions was reported among wild boar and red deer inspected between 1992 and 2004 in Southwestern Spain. Sporadic cases of badger TB have been detected, further complicating the picture. Gene expression profiles were characterized in European wild boar and Iberian red deer naturally infected with M. bovis. The comparative analysis of gene expression profiles in wildlife hosts in response to infection advanced our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of infection and pathogenesis, revealed common and distinctive host responses to infection and identified candidate genes associated with resistance to bTB and for the characterization of host response to infection and vaccination. Ongoing research is producing valuable knowledge on vaccine delivery, safety and efficacy issues. Baits for the oral delivery of BCG vaccine preparations to wild boar piglets were developed and evaluated. The use of selective feeders during the summer was found to be a potentially reliable bait-deployment strategy. Safety experiments yielded no isolation of M. bovis BCG from faeces, internal organs at necropsy and the environment, even after oral delivery of very high doses. Finally, preliminary vaccination and challenge experiments suggested that a single oral BCG vaccination may protect wild boar from infection by a virulent M. bovis field strain.
