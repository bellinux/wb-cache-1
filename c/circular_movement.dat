5|$|The {{most common}} {{presenting}} sign is a coarse slow tremor {{of the hand}} at rest which disappears during voluntary movement of the affected arm and in the deeper stages of sleep. It typically appears in only one hand, eventually affecting both hands as the disease progresses. Frequency of PD tremor is between 4 and 6 hertz (cycles per second). A feature of tremor is pill-rolling, the tendency of the index finger and thumb to touch and perform together a <b>circular</b> <b>movement.</b> The term derives from the similarity between the movement of people with PD and the early pharmaceutical technique of manually making pills.|$|E
5|$|Wind blowing {{over the}} surface of the sea causes {{friction}} at the interface between air and sea. Not only does this cause waves to form but it also makes the surface seawater move {{in the same direction as}} the wind. Although winds are variable, in any one place they predominantly blow from a single direction and thus a surface current can be formed. Westerly winds are most frequent in the mid-latitudes while easterlies dominate the tropics. When water moves in this way, other water flows in to fill the gap and a <b>circular</b> <b>movement</b> of surface currents known as a gyre is formed. There are five main gyres in the world's oceans: two in the Pacific, two in the Atlantic, and one in the Indian Ocean. The North Atlantic gyre that produces the Sargasso Sea accumulates salinity levels as high as 38‰. Other smaller gyres are found in lesser seas and a single gyre flows around Antarctica. These gyres have followed the same routes for millennia, guided by the topography of the land, the wind direction, and the Coriolis effect. The surface currents flow in a clockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere and anticlockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. The water moving away from the equator is warm, while that flowing towards it has lost most of its heat. These currents tend to moderate the Earth's climate, cooling the equatorial region, and warming regions at higher latitudes. Global climate and weather forecasts are powerfully affected by the world ocean, so global climate modelling makes use of ocean circulation models as well as models of other major components such as the atmosphere, land surfaces, aerosols, and sea ice. Ocean models make use of a branch of physics, geophysical fluid dynamics, that describes the large-scale flow of fluids such as seawater.|$|E

25|$|If a {{low-pressure}} area {{forms in}} the atmosphere, air tends to flow in towards it, but is deflected perpendicular to its velocity by the Coriolis force. A system of equilibrium can then establish itself creating <b>circular</b> <b>movement,</b> or a cyclonic flow. Because the Rossby number is low, the force balance is largely between the pressure gradient force acting towards the low-pressure area and the Coriolis force acting away {{from the center of}} the low pressure.|$|E
25|$|A {{gyratory crusher}} {{is similar in}} basic concept to a jaw crusher, {{consisting}} of a concave surface and a conical head; both surfaces are typically lined with manganese steel surfaces. The inner cone has a slight <b>circular</b> <b>movement,</b> but does not rotate; the movement is generated by an eccentric arrangement. As with the jaw crusher, material travels downward between the two surfaces being progressively crushed until it is small enough to fall out through {{the gap between the}} two surfaces.|$|E

25|$|Because of his {{philosophical}} beliefs, René Descartes {{proposed in}} 1644 that no empty space can exist and that space must consequently {{be filled with}} matter. The parts of this matter tend to move in straight paths, but because they lie close together, they can not move freely, which according to Descartes implies that every motion is circular, so the aether is filled with vortices. Descartes also distinguishes between different forms and sizes of matter in which rough matter resists the <b>circular</b> <b>movement</b> more strongly than fine matter. Due to centrifugal force, matter tends towards the outer edges of the vortex, which causes a condensation of this matter there. The rough matter cannot follow this movement due to its greater inertia—so due to {{the pressure of the}} condensed outer matter those parts will be pushed {{into the center of the}} vortex. According to Descartes, this inward pressure is nothing else than gravity. He compared this mechanism with the fact that if a rotating, liquid filled vessel is stopped, the liquid goes on to rotate. Now, if one drops small pieces of light matter (e.g. wood) into the vessel, the pieces move to the middle of the vessel.|$|E

500|$|ASL has a rich {{system of}} verbal inflection. This {{involves}} both grammatical aspect—how {{the action of}} verbs flows in time—and agreement marking. Aspect can be marked by changing the manner of movement of the verb; for example, continuous aspect is marked by incorporating rhythmic, <b>circular</b> <b>movement,</b> while punctual aspect is achieved by modifying the sign so {{that it has a}} stationary hand position. Verbs may agree with both the subject and the object, and are marked for number and reciprocity. Reciprocity is indicated by using two one-handed signs; for example, the sign SHOOT, made with an L-shaped handshape with inward movement of the thumb, inflects to SHOOT, articulated by having two L-shaped hands [...] "shooting" [...] at each other.|$|E

40|$|Epipolar image {{analysis}} is a robust method for 3 D scene depth reconstruction that uses all available views {{of an image}} sequence simultaneously. It is restricted to horizontal, linear, and equidistant camera movements. In this paper, we present a concept for an extension of epipolar {{image analysis}} to other camera configurations like, e. g., <b>circular</b> <b>movements.</b> Instead of searching for straight lines in the epipolar image, we explicitly compute the trajectories of particular points through the image cube. Variation of the unknown depth leads to different curves. From those, the one corresponding to the true depth is selected by evaluating color constancy along the curve. In order to handle occlusions correctly an explicit occlusion compatible ordering scheme is derived for the case of <b>circular</b> <b>movements.</b> To compensate the influence of perspective projection we introduce a depth corrected epipolar image analysis algorithm which we call image cube trajectory analysis (ICT) ...|$|R

50|$|Friedrich Schleiermacher's {{approach}} to interpretation {{focuses on the}} importance of the interpreter understanding the text as a necessary stage to interpreting it.

Even reading a sentence involves these repeated <b>circular</b> <b>movements</b> through a hierarchy of parts-whole relationships. Thus, as we are reading this sentence, you are analysing single words as the text unfolds, but you are also weighing the meaning of each word against our changing sense of the overall meaning of the sentence you are reading, or perhaps misunderstanding, or maybe this sentence is reminding you of, or clashing with, another view about interpretation you have, in the past, advocated or disparaged. Hence we are brought to the sentence's larger historical context, depending on its location, and our own circumstances.|$|R
