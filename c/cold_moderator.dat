50|$|The {{spallation}} neutron source SINQ is a continuous source - {{the first of}} its kind in the world - with a flux of about 1014 n/cm2/s. Beside thermal neutrons, a <b>cold</b> <b>moderator</b> of liquid deuterium (cold source) slows neutrons down and shifts their spectrum to lower energies. These neutrons have proved to be particularly valuable in materials research and in the investigation of biological substances. SINQ is a user facility. Interested groups can apply for beamtime on the various instruments by using the SINQ proposal system.|$|E
50|$|After {{neutrons}} are produced, {{they need}} to be slowed down (decrease in kinetic energy), to the speed desired for imaging. This can take the form of some length of water, polyethylene, or graphite at room temperature to produce thermal neutrons. In the moderator the neutrons will collide with the nucleus of atoms and so slow down. Eventually the speed of these neutrons will achieve some distribution based on the temperature (amount of kinetic energy) of the moderator. If higher energy neutrons are desired, a graphite moderator can be heated to produce neutrons of higher energy (termed epithermal neutrons). For lower energy neutrons, a <b>cold</b> <b>moderator</b> such as liquid deuterium (an isotope of Hydrogen), can be used to produce low energy neutrons (cold neutron). If no or less moderator is present, high energy neutrons (termed fast neutrons), can be produced. The higher the temperature of the moderator, the higher the resulting kinetic energy of the neutrons is and the faster the neutrons will travel. Generally, faster neutrons will be more penetrating, but some interesting deviations from this trend exist and can sometimes be utilized in neutron imaging. Generally an imaging system is designed and set up to produce only a single energy of neutrons, with most imaging systems producing thermal or cold neutrons.|$|E

The first one, ethane (C 2 H 6), is an organic compound {{which is very}} interesting from the neutronic point of view, in some respects better than liquid methane to produce subthermal neutrons, {{not only because it}} remains in liquid phase through a wider temperature range (Tf = 90. 4 [*]K, Tb = 184. 6 [*]K), but also because of its high protonic density together with its frequency spectrum with a low rotational energy band.

40|$|AbstractLarge {{spallation}} neutron facilities share with compact sources the constraint that the moderation of neutrons {{relies on a}} random scattering process. Recently, proposals have been made how to furnish cold moderators with some preferential direction for the scattering and the emission of cold neutrons. Propositions presented so far aim primarily at enhancing the emission of moderated neutrons out of the scattering volume. The use of silicon single crystals and nano-structured material has been proposed to boost or suppress scattering along selected directions, respectively. The recent implementation of a beryllium reflector-filter for a hydrogen moderator system at the Manuel Lujan neutron scattering center augmented moderated neutron flux by reflecting thermal neutrons back into a <b>cold</b> <b>moderator.</b> This installation has met with striking success and proved the technical feasibility of selectable preferential provision of cold and thermal neutrons. In this short contribution a tiny scoping study is presented together with a conceptual sketch of a novel moderator set-up. The approach strives to combine the existing results with some additional measures for increasing the primary neutron flux inside a <b>cold</b> <b>moderator.</b> Even base-lining some generic boundary conditions and not taking peculiarities of materials into account, moderator performance can be improved by mere geometrical internal modifications. Conceiving a “pre-moderator” primarily as “primary reflector” appears to offer additional possibilities for optimization. The expectation is that, depending on design and materials’ choices, mixed or cold spectra can be obtained, with the flux of demanded neutrons increased along selected directions of preferential emission. Anticipating more extensive confirmative numerical simulations, the obvious next step could be a first test of the proposed concept at a compact neutron source...|$|E

40|$|AbstractLiquid hydrogen, ice {{and solid}} methane are common neutron moderating materials. More {{recently}} methane hydrate and mesitylene {{have been proposed}} to improve performance of these materials. Liquid hydrogen is used in high-power spallation neutron sources {{since it is the}} only material that withstands such high power. Despite this, it is affected by radiation leading to spontaneous release of energy. It can be controlled by programmed annealings. Solid methane generally shows the highest neutron flux but, it is affected by radiation leading to formation of organic contaminants. In addition, spontaneous release of stored energy, that could damage the moderator container, was detected. Mesitylene is less affected by radiation and therefore, no spontaneous release of energy is observed or accumulation of any major contaminant. However, mesitylene shows a lower neutron energy spectrum than solid methane. Methane hydrate was considered as an alternative. Nevertheless, reduced intensity of neutrons has been observed compared to solid methane.

40|$|Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) of USA and Kharkov Institute of Physics and Technology (KIPT) of Ukraine {{have been}} collaborating on the {{conceptual}} design {{development of a}} neutron source facility. It {{is based on the}} use of an electron accelerator driven subcritical (ADS) facility with low enriched uranium fuel, using the existing electron accelerators at KIPT of Ukraine [1]. The neutron source of the subcritical assembly is generated from the interaction of 100 -KW electron beam, which has a uniform spatial distribution and the electron energy in the range of 100 to 200 MeV, with a natural uranium target [2]. The main functions of the facility are the production of medical isotopes and the support of the Ukraine nuclear power industry. Neutron beam experiments and material studies are also included. Over the past two-three decades, structures with characteristic lengths of 100 {angstrom} and correspondingly smaller vibrational energies have become increasingly important for both science and technology [3]. The characteristic dimensions of the microstructures can be well matched by neutrons with longer vibrational wavelength and lower energy. In the accelerator-driven subcritical facility, most of the neutrons are generated from fission reactions with energy in the MeV range. They are slowed down to the meV energy range through scattering reactions in the moderator and reflector materials. However, the fraction of neutrons with energies less than 5 meV in a normal moderator spectrum is very low because of up-scattering caused by the thermal motion of moderator or reflector molecules. In order to obtain neutrons with energy less than 5 meV, cryogenically cooled moderators 'cold neutron sources' should be used to slow down the neutrons. These cold moderators shift the neutron energy spectrum down because the thermal motion of moderator molecules as well as the up-scattering is very small, which provides large gains in intensity of low energy neutrons, E < 5 meV. The accelerator driven subcritical facility is designed with a provision to add a cryogenically cooled moderator system. This cold neutron source could provide the neutrons beams with lower energy, which could be utilized in scattering experiment and material structures analysis. This study describes the performed physics analyses to define and characterize the cold neutron source of the KIPT neutron source facility. The cold neutron source is designed to optimize the cold neutron brightness to the experimental instruments outside the radial heavy concrete shield of the facility. Liquid hydrogen or solid methane with 20 K temperature is used as a <b>cold</b> <b>moderator.</b> Monte Carlo computer code MCNPX [4], with ENDF/B-VI nuclear data libraries, is utilized to calculate the cold neutron source performance and estimate the nuclear heat load to the <b>cold</b> <b>moderator.</b> The surface source generation capability of MCNPX code has been used to provide the possibility of analyzing different design configurations and perform design optimization analyses with reasonable computer resources.

40|$|The unperturbed neutron {{brightness}} of a moderator {{can be defined}} {{from the number of}} neutrons leaving the surface of a moderator completely surrounded by a reflector. Without openings for beam extraction, it is the maximum brightness that can be theoretically achieved in a moderator. The unperturbed {{brightness of}} a cylindrical <b>cold</b> <b>moderator</b> filled with pure para-H- 2 was calculated using MCNPX; the moderator dimensions were optimised, for a fixed target and reflector geometry corresponding to the present concept for the BS spallation source. This quantity does not depend on openings for beam extraction and therefore can be used for a first-round optimisation of a moderator, before effects due to beam openings are considered. We find that such an optimisation yields to a factor of 2 increase with respect to a conventional volume moderator, large enough to accommodate a viewed surface of 12 x 12 cm(2) : the unperturbed neutron brightness is maximum for a disc-shaped moderator of 15 cm diameter, 1. 4 cm height. The reasons for this increase can be related to the properties of the scattering cross-section of paraH(2), to the added reflector around the exit surface {{in the case of a}} compact moderator, and to a directionality effect. This large optimisation gain in the unperturbed brightness hints towards similar potentials for the perturbed neutron brightness, in particular in conjunction with advancing the optical quality of neutron delivery from the moderator to the sample, where by Lionville theorem the brightness is conserved over the beam trajectory, except for absorption and similar type losses.

Over the course of this work, they were able to develop a new module for NJOY called LEAPR based on the LEAP + ADDELT code from the UK as modified by D. J. Picton for cold-moderator calculations. Much of the physics for methane came from Picton`s work. The liquid hydrogen work was originally based on a code using the Young-Koppel approach that went through a number of hands in Europe (including Rolf Neef and Guy Robert). It was generalized and extended for LEAPR, and depends strongly on work by Keinert and Sax of the University of Stuttgart. Thus, their collection of cold-moderator scattering kernels is truly an international effort, and they are glad to be able to return the enhanced evaluations and processing techniques to the international community. In this paper, they give sections on the major <b>cold</b> <b>moderator</b> materials (namely, solid methane, liquid methane, and liquid hydrogen) using each section to introduce the relevant physics for that material and to show typical results...|$|E
40|$|The Advanced Neutron Source {{will employ}} two cold sources to {{moderate}} neutrons to low energy (< 10 meV). The cold neutrons produced are then passed through beam guides to various experiment stations. Each <b>cold</b> source <b>moderator</b> is a sphere of 410 -mm internal diameter. The moderator material is liquid deuterium flowing {{at a rate}} of 1 kg/s and maintained at subcooled temperatures at all points of the circuit, to prevent boiling. Nuclear beat deposited within the liquid deuterium and its containment structure totals more than 30 kW. All of this heat is removed by the liquid deuterium, which raises its temperature by 5 K. The liquid prime mover is a cryogenic circulator that is situated in the return leg of the flow loop. This arrangement minimizes the heat added to the liquid between the heat exchanger and the moderator vessel, allowing the moderator to be operated at the minimum practical temperature. This report describes the latest thinking at the time of project termination. It also includes the status of various systems at that time and outlines anticipated directions in which the design would have progressed. In this regard, some detail differences between this report and official design documents reflect ideas that were not approved at the time of closure but are considered noteworthy...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} the {{performance}} of a <b>cold</b> hydrogen <b>moderator</b> and a supermirror based neutron beam extraction system of the flight path 12 at LANSCE has been performed based on energy resolved neutron optical imaging. We have developed a pinhole camera system with a 2 D position sensitive 3 He multiwire proportional chamber neutron detector with delay line position encoding 0. 75 mm pixel size, together with a standalone time of flight electronic system with 1. 2 ms dead time. We have determined the efficiency, resolution, and counting rate saturation of the detector. In particular, we have considered an impact of these parameters {{on the quality of the}} images. The neutron images of the moderator were taken as a function of the neutron wavelength given by the time of flight information. The images were recorded as arrays of 256 256 2000 pixels; x and y coordinates, and time of flight. Information obtained from the images includes a distribution of the brightness on the neutron moderator, the efficiency and geometrical accuracy of the beam extraction system, and the reflectivity of the supermirror coated elements of its optics. Our results demonstrate that the pinhole optical camerabased neutron imaging method combined with time of flight information is an extremely efficient tool to characterize neutron sources and neutron beam extraction systems. r 2006 Elsevier B.

40|$|A liquid H{sub 2 } {{moderator}} {{has been}} operational at the Manual Lujan Jr. Neutron Scattering Center (Lujan Center) since 1985. Detailed Monte Carlo calculations {{have been made}} to estimate the neutronic performance of the liquid H{sub 2 } <b>moderator</b> <b>cold</b> source, using the state-of-the-art Los Alamos LAHET Code System and liquid H{sub 2 } scattering kernels. The absolute neutron spectrum leaking from the moderator has been measured. In thermal equilibrium at 20 K, the moderator would convert to 100 % para-hydrogen on some time frame. The authors show that the performance of the Lujan Center cold neutron source is sensitive to small fractions of ortho-hydrogen, and display these results {{as a function of the}} ortho/para H{sub 2 } concentration. Integral data from the measured neuron spectrum have been combined with calculated predictions to estimate the ortho/para H{sub 2 } concentration in the moderator. From these analyses, they estimate the ortho-hydrogen concentration in the liquid H{sub 2 } moderator to be 6 [...] 9 % at the time the neutron spectrum was measured...|$|R
