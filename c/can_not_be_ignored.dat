These techniques are combined using Modified Shimura technique of Rank aggregation. The aggregated ranking is then compared with the original ranking given by the search engine. The correlation coefficient thus obtained is averaged for a set of queries. We show our experimental results pertaining to seven public search engines and fifteen queries...|$|R

In some applications, an adsorbing layer must be formed on the resonator surface, which adsorbs the material whose mass is measured. This layer aÂ®ects not only the resonant frequency but also its damping as it is viscoelastic. Its presence <b>can</b> <b>not</b> simply <b>be</b> <b>ignored</b> but should <b>be</b> included in the modeling. In our previous work, the algorithm to characterize the viscoelastic layer's properties was developed, in which the multiple resonant frequencies and the corresponding resonant resistances were considered including the overtone operation of the quartz crystal plate [1]. It is unrealistic however to assume that the layer's properties are unchanged for such a wide frequency range. In the present paper, no overtone resonance is considered. Mass of the adsorbed material and the thickness of the viscoelastic layer are identiÂ¯ed by means of the Newton's method. 1...|$|R
