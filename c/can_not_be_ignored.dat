These techniques are combined using Modified Shimura technique of Rank aggregation. The aggregated ranking is then compared with the original ranking given by the search engine.

In some applications, an adsorbing layer must be formed on the resonator surface, which adsorbs the material whose mass is measured. This layer a®ects not only the resonant frequency but also its damping as it is viscoelastic. Its presence <b>can</b> <b>not</b> simply <b>be</b> <b>ignored</b> but should <b>be</b> included in the modeling. In our previous work, the algorithm to characterize the viscoelastic layer's properties was developed, in which the multiple resonant frequencies and the corresponding resonant resistances were considered including the overtone operation of the quartz crystal plate [1]. It is unrealistic however to assume that the layer's properties are unchanged for such a wide frequency range. In the present paper, no overtone resonance is considered. Mass of the adsorbed material and the thickness of the viscoelastic layer are identi¯ed by means of the Newton's method. 1...|$|R
