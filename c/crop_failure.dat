5|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a {{backlash}} against the external environmental effects of conventional agriculture, resulting in the organic movement. Famines continued to sweep the globe through the 20th century. Through the effects of climactic events, government policy, war and <b>crop</b> <b>failure,</b> millions of people died in each of at least ten famines between the 1920s and the 1990s.|$|E

However, following a major <b>crop</b> <b>failure</b> in 1917, he became the town's bank clerk after employment in a convenience store, but later left for Kronau, Saskatchewan due to a combination of poor business and boredom; the family ranch was later abandoned in 1923. After skipping several years of high school education through a fast-track course at Regina College, Eggleston enrolled for a Bachelor of Arts program at Queen's University in 1926.|$|E

A {{series of}} {{incidents}} in October 1849 damaged relations between both countries; {{a series of}} assassinations directed at the French frontier had occurred, and the French Consul had requested the dismissal of Pacha Ouchda, who was believed to have caused these issues. From 1845 to 1851, Morocco had a serious agricultural crisis caused by a drought, resulting in <b>crop</b> <b>failure.</b> The people of Morocco were suffering {{as the price of}} wheat and barley reached unprecedented heights. In Salé, many people were starving, and the agricultural crisis and anger towards France ultimately led to the bombardment of Salé.|$|E

5|$|After its {{introduction}} from South America to Spain {{in the late}} 1500s, the potato became a staple crop throughout Europe by the late 1700s. The potato allowed farmers to produce more food, and initially added variety to the European diet. The increased supply of food reduced disease, increased births and reduced mortality, causing a population boom throughout the British Empire, the US and Europe. The introduction of the potato also brought about the first intensive use of fertilizer, {{in the form of}} guano imported to Europe from Peru, and the first artificial pesticide, {{in the form of an}} arsenic compound used to fight Colorado potato beetles. Before the adoption of the potato as a major crop, the dependence on grain had caused repetitive regional and national famines when the crops failed, including 17 major famines in England between 1523 and 1623. The resulting dependence on the potato however caused the European Potato Failure, a disastrous <b>crop</b> <b>failure</b> from disease that resulted in widespread famine and the death of over one million people in Ireland alone.|$|E
5|$|By the 16th century, {{however, the}} {{expansion}} of European trade – albeit restricted to islands near Guangzhou like Macau – spread the Columbian Exchange of crops, plants, and animals into China, introducing chili peppers to Sichuan cuisine and highly productive corn and potatoes, which diminished famines and spurred population growth. The growth of Portuguese, Spanish, and Dutch trade created new demand for Chinese products and produced a massive influx of Japanese and American silver. This abundance of specie remonetized the Ming economy, whose paper money had suffered repeated hyperinflation and was no longer trusted. While traditional Confucians opposed such a prominent role for commerce and the newly rich it created, the heterodoxy introduced by Wang Yangming permitted a more accommodating attitude. Zhang Juzheng's initially successful reforms proved devastating when a slowdown in agriculture produced by the Little Ice Age joined changes in Japanese and Spanish policy that quickly cut off the supply of silver now necessary for farmers {{to be able to}} pay their taxes. Combined with <b>crop</b> <b>failure,</b> floods, and epidemic, the dynasty collapsed before the rebel leader Li Zicheng, who was defeated by the Manchu-led Eight Banner armies who founded the Qing dynasty.|$|E

25|$|A 2012 study, did a {{regional}} survey on farmers suicide in rural Vidarbha (Maharashtra) and applied a Smith's Saliency method to qualitatively rank the expressed causes among farming families {{who had lost}} someone to suicide. The expressed reasons in order of importance behind farmer suicides were – debt, alcohol addiction, environment, low produce prices, stress and family responsibilities, apathy, poor irrigation, increased cost of cultivation, private money lenders, use of chemical fertilizers and <b>crop</b> <b>failure.</b> In other words, debt to stress and family responsibilities were rated as significantly higher than fertilizers and <b>crop</b> <b>failure.</b> In a different study in the same region in 2006, indebtedness (87%) and deterioration in the economic status (74%) {{were found to be}} major risk factors for suicide.|$|E

25|$|Sweet {{potatoes}} are cultivated throughout tropical and warm temperate regions wherever {{there is sufficient}} water to support their growth. Due to a major <b>crop</b> <b>failure,</b> sweet potatoes were introduced to Fujian province of China in about 1594 from Luzon.

Sweet potatoes were introduced as a food crop in Japan, and by 1735 were planted in Shogun Tokugawa Yoshimune's private garden. It was also introduced to Korea in 1764.|$|E
5|$|The {{first years}} of the 14th century were marked by famines, {{culminating}} in the Great Famine of 1315–17. The causes of the Great Famine included the slow transition from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age, which left the population vulnerable when bad weather caused <b>crop</b> <b>failures.</b> The years 1313–14 and 1317–21 were excessively rainy throughout Europe, resulting in widespread <b>crop</b> <b>failures.</b> The climate change—which resulted in a declining average annual temperature for Europe during the 14th century—was accompanied by an economic downturn.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{ability of}} {{a country or region}} to feed itself in the {{upcoming}} decades is a question of importance. The population in West Africa is expected to increase significantly in the next 30 years. The responses of food crops to short term climate change is therefore critical to the population at large and the decision makers tasked with providing food for their people. An ensemble of near term climate projections are used to simulate maize, millet and sorghum in West Africa in the recent historic and near term future. The mean yields are not expected to alter significantly, while there is an increase in inter annual variability. This increase in variability increases the likelihood of <b>crop</b> <b>failures,</b> which are defined as yield negative anomalies beyond one standard deviation during a period of 20 years. The increasing variability increases the frequency and intensity of <b>crop</b> <b>failures</b> across West Africa. The mean return frequency between mild maize <b>crop</b> <b>failures</b> from process based crop models increases from once every 6. 8 years to once every 4. 5 years. The mean return time frequency for severe <b>crop</b> <b>failures</b> (beyond 1. 5 standard deviations) also almost doubles from once every 16. 5 years to once every 8. 5 years. Two adaptation responses to climate change, the adoption of heat-resistant cultivars and the use of captured rainwater have been investigated using one crop model in an idealised sensitivity test. The generalised adoption of a cultivar resistant to high temperature stress during flowering is shown to be more beneficial than using rainwater harvesting by both increasing yields and the return frequency of <b>crop</b> <b>failures...</b>|$|R

Consequently, agriculture and the economy were in shambles and rebellion broke out among the hundreds of thousands of peasants called upon to work on repairing the dikes of the Yellow River.|$|E
25|$|In {{the chapter}} about A Folk Tale in My Theatre Life (Mit Teaterliv), Bournonville makes his {{attitude}} {{to the present}} and the past clear: he indicates that our practical and rather unpoetic times (which seem about to precipitate a period of literary and artistic <b>crop</b> <b>failure</b> on the very lands that were once the richest soil of the imagination) art has fallen by the wayside.

25|$|These radically harmful {{changes in}} farming {{organization}} coincided with adverse weather patterns, including droughts and floods. In July 1959, the Yellow River flooded in East China.

In 2005, the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee, the Indian regulatory authority, released a study on field tests of certain Bt cotton strains in AP and ruled that Monsanto could not market those strains in AP because of poor yields. At about the same time, the state agriculture minister barred the company from selling Bt cotton seed, because Monsanto refused a request by the state government to provide pay about Rs 4.5 crore (about one million US$) to indebted farmers in some districts, and because the government blamed Monsanto's seeds for <b>crop</b> <b>failures.</b> The order was later lifted.|$|R
