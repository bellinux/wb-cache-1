5|$|Some historians, such as Chandler and Weller, {{assert that}} the British heavy cavalry were {{destroyed}} as a viable force following their first, epic charge. Barbero states that the Scots Grey were practically wiped out and that the other two regiments of the Union Brigade suffered comparable losses. Other historians, such as Clark-Kennedy and Wood, citing British eyewitness accounts, describe the continuing role of the heavy cavalry after their charge. The heavy brigades, far from being ineffective, continued to provide valuable services. They countercharged French cavalry numerous times (both brigades), halted a combined cavalry and infantry attack (Household Brigade only), were used to bolster the morale of those units in their vicinity at times of crisis, and filled gaps in the Anglo-allied line caused by high casualties in infantry formations (both brigades). This service was rendered {{at a very high}} cost, as close combat with French <b>cavalry,</b> <b>carbine</b> fire, infantry musketry and—more deadly than all of these—artillery fire steadily eroded the number of effectives in the two brigades. At 6 o'clock in the afternoon the whole Union Brigade could field only 3 squadrons, though these countercharged French cavalry, losing half their number in the process. At the end of the fighting the two brigades, by this time combined, could muster one squadron.|$|E
2500|$|The SMLE's visual {{trademark}} was its blunt nose, {{with only}} the bayonet boss protruding {{a small fraction of}} an inch beyond the nosecap, being modeled on the Swedish Model 1894 <b>Cavalry</b> <b>Carbine.</b> The new rifle also incorporated a charger loading system, another innovation borrowed from the Mauser rifle' and is notably different from the fixed [...] "bridge" [...] that later became the standard, being a charger clip (stripper clip) guide {{on the face of the}} bolt head. The shorter length was controversial at the time: many Rifle Association members and gunsmiths were concerned that the shorter barrel would not be as accurate as the longer MLE barrels, that the recoil would be much greater, and the sighting radius would be too short.|$|E

The next year, a shorter version {{was introduced}} as the Lee–Enfield <b>Cavalry</b> <b>Carbine</b> Mk I, or LEC, with a [...] barrel {{as opposed to the}} [...] one in the [...] "long" [...] version. Both underwent a minor upgrade series in 1899 (the omission of the cleaning / clearing rod), becoming the Mk I*. Many LECs (and LMCs in smaller numbers) were converted to special patterns, namely the New Zealand Carbine and the Royal Irish Constabulary Carbine, or NZ and RIC carbines, respectively. Some of the MLEs (and MLMs) were converted to load from chargers, and designated Charger Loading Lee–Enfields, or CLLEs.|$|E

At times, the cavalry fought dismounted, with their horses led at a safe distance behind.

2500|$|Quicker than thought I {{brought my}} saber down {{with all my}} {{strength}} upon [...] head.

He fell senseless on his side, then rolled over on his back. He had in his hand a short Sharpe's <b>cavalry</b> <b>carbine.</b> I think he had just fired as I reached Colonel Washington, for the Marine who followed me into the aperture made by the ladder received a bullet in the abdomen, from which he died in a few minutes. The shot might have been fired by someone else in the insurgent party, but I think it was from Brown. Instinctively as Brown fell I gave him a saber thrust in the left breast. The sword I carried was a light uniform weapon, and, either not having a point or striking something hard in Brown's accouterments, did not penetrate. The blade bent double.|$|E

Closer investigation, however, revealed 350 kegs of gunpowder and a consignment letter authorizing the British skipper to turn the material over to the first Confederate Army commander he encountered. William, G. Anderson placed a prize crew of six men, under Acting Master C. W. Harriman, on board Lilly and sent her to Key West, Florida, while the bark resumed her patrols.

Then there was more smoking of the peace pipe, peace chants, giving up his three Winchester rifles, {{followed}} by the surrender of about 120 firearms, largely Winchesters, and <b>cavalry</b> <b>carbines</b> of other warriors. Instead of arms, some of the warriors laid sticks upon the ground saying, “Cola (friend), this is my gun, the little one is my pistol. Send to my lodge and get them.” Every one of these pledges was made good by the owner, but needless top say, many rifles and other arms must have been hidden before the Indians came in, to be regained later, because they had for years the best of opportunities and ample resources {{in the way of}} robes, furs and ponies to trade for them. This barter was carried on clandestinely with cowboys, half-breeds or other Indians on the reservations {{as well as with the}} regular Indian traders and itinerant white peddlers. It is safe to say that not more than one fourth of their weapons were surrendered any more than those hundreds more of his warriors who had sneaked into various agencies.|$|R
5000|$|The carbine was {{originally}} a lighter, shortened weapon {{developed for the}} <b>cavalry.</b> <b>Carbines</b> were short enough to be loaded and fired from horseback, but this was rarely donea moving horse is a very unsteady platform, and once halted, a soldier can load and fire more easily if dismounted, which also makes him a smaller target (Napoleonic-era and earlier cavalry did fight from horseback, but they fought with sabers and large muzzle-loading horse pistols, so called because their large size meant they were most easily carried in a saddle holster, much like the later Colt-Walker revolver). After the Napoleonic Wars, cavalry began fighting dismounted, using the horses only for greater mobility, an early form of what is today known as mechanized infantry. By the American Civil War, dismounted cavalry were mostly the rule. The principal advantage of the carbine was that its length made it very portable. Troops could carry full-length muskets comfortably enough on horseback if just riding from A to B (the practice of the original dragoons and other mounted infantry). Cavalry proper (a [...] "Regiment of Horse") had to ride with some agility and engage in sword-wielding melées with opposing cavalry or pursue running infantry, so carrying anything long would be a dangerous encumbrance. A carbine was typically no longer than a sheathed sabre, and like a sheathed sabre was carried arranged to hang clear of the rider's elbows and horse's legs.|$|R
50|$|The Snider-Enfield was {{produced}} in several variants. The most commonly encountered variants were the Rifled Musket or Long Rifle, the Short Rifle, and the Cavalry and Artillery Carbines.

It was issued to line infantry and has three-groove rifling with one turn in 78 in. The Short Rifle has a 30.5 in barrel and two barrel bands with iron furniture. This variant was issued to sergeants of line infantry and rifle units. It has five-groove rifling with one turn in 48 in. The <b>Cavalry</b> <b>Carbine</b> is half stocked and has only one barrel band. It has a 19.5 in barrel, with the same rifling as the Short Rifle.

Production began at the Oberndorf factory for the infantry version, which fired a black powder 11×60mm round from a long 850 mm barrel.

Senior officers had white plumes and gilded brass. The cuirass had front and back plates made of polished steel and had leather straps with brass scales, brass studs and fittings and the cuirass lining was edged with white in all regiments. Cuirassiers were armed with a straight-bladed <b>cavalry</b> sword, <b>carbine</b> and a pistol from 1806.|$|R
