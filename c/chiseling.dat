5|$|Faced {{with one}} last push over {{mountains}} that {{were described as}} much worse than the Wasatch, the ragtag company had {{to decide whether to}} forge ahead or rest their cattle. It was October 20 and they had been told that the pass would not be snowed in until the middle of November. William Pike was killed when a gun being loaded by William Foster was discharged negligently, an event that seemed to make the decision for them; family by family, they resumed their journey, first the Breens, then Kesebergs, Stanton with the Reeds, Graveses, and Murphys. The Donners waited and traveled last. After a few miles of rough terrain, an axle broke on one of the Donners' wagons. Jacob and George went into the woods to fashion a replacement. George Donner sliced his hand open while <b>chiseling</b> the wood, but it seemed a superficial wound.|$|E
25|$|The strikers, however, {{lost nearly}} all of the gains they had won in the next few years. The IWW disdained written {{contracts}}, holding that such contracts encouraged workers to abandon the daily class struggle. The mill owners proved more persistent, slowly <b>chiseling</b> away at the improvements in wages and working conditions, while firing union activists and installing labor spies {{to keep an eye on}} workers. A depression in the industry, followed by another speedup, led to further layoffs.|$|E
25|$|The silver {{collection}} contains just under 1,300 {{pieces from the}} 15th to 19th centuries, and is {{recognized as one of}} the most important in Mexico. The pieces include repoussé work, <b>chiseling,</b> graffito and filigree, along with pieces set with precious and semi-precious stones and those containing enamels and others with gold. Most are pieces related to Catholic liturgy and include censers, chalices, lamps, candlesticks, ciboriums, crosses and tabernacles, but there are also non-religious pieces such as gold cigarette cases, cutlery, plays and trays.|$|E
50|$|Japanese <b>chisel</b> (nomi 鑿). These come in {{a larger}} variety of types and {{gradations}} than the Western <b>chisel.</b> There are bench <b>chisels,</b> paring <b>chisels,</b> striking <b>chisels,</b> heavy timber <b>chisels</b> and slicks, and myriad others for specialized applications. Like the planes, the blades are of laminated hard steel/soft steel construction. Bevel angle varies from 20˚ to 35˚ typically, with mortising and heavy <b>chisels</b> featuring steep angles, and paring <b>chisels</b> having shallower angles. It is common in Japan to work with softwoods, so many <b>chisels</b> are made with that in mind, and require the bevels be steepened if employed for harder woods.|$|R

He invented a new calculation method how to overcome the shrinkage problem at casting large-scale statues and art objects from stainless steel. Eight such monuments were erected around the country among them War Memorial for Polish Soldiers, Tranås, Fountain with four children and Clown. He was very active and inventive also in painting and drawing. He developed a novel painting technique, which he named as paper fresco. Here basically the paper pulp was carried up in few centimeters thickness and the paint was applied to color some part of the pulp itself, but after drying <b>chiseling</b> was also applied to get the paper fresco final form.|$|E
500|$|Sandstone {{rocks at}} Twyfelfontein {{are covered by}} the {{so-called}} desert varnish, a hard patina that appears brown or dark grey. Engravings were effected by <b>chiseling</b> through this patina, exposing the lighter rock underneath. The indentations were created {{over the course of}} thousands of years. The oldest engravings might be as old as 10,000 years, and the creation of new works probably ended by the arrival of pastoral tribes around 1000 AD.|$|E

Usually hot <b>chisels</b> are thinner and therefore can not be substituted with cold <b>chisels.</b> Also many smiths shape <b>chisels</b> as to have a simple twisted handle as to resemble a hammer, they can be used at a greater distance away from the hot metals. They are very useful and found throughout the world.|$|R

Han called the work [...] "an explanation of nature's physical reaction when it is impacted by force, gravity and energy", and commented: [...] "When I am working on stone, the immediate context is physical, the force of hammering, <b>chiseling</b> and drilling hard stone creates heat and energy.

However, without the others' knowledge, César pocketed a diamond ring as a bauble for his lover Viviane, a chanteuse at Grutter's club. The four men arrange to fence the loot with a London contact. Meanwhile, Grutter has seen Mado and her injuries, who breaks off their relationship. Infuriated at Tony's interference in his life, he gives heroin to his drug-addicted brother Rémy and tells him to murder Tony. Grutter sees the diamond César gave to Viviane and realizes that César, Mario, and Tony {{were responsible for the}} jewel theft. Grutter forces César to confess. Forsaking a 10 million franc police reward, Grutter decides to steal the jewels from Tony's gang, his brother Rémy brutally murdering Mario and his wife Ida when they refuse to reveal where the loot is hidden. Tony retrieves it from the couple's apartment and anonymously pays for a splendid funeral for them. He then goes looking for Grutter and stumbles onto the captive César, who confesses having squealed. Citing [...] "the rules," [...] Tony ruefully kills him.|$|E

In the Mature Harappan period, from about 2600 BCE to 1900 BCE, strings of Indus signs are commonly found on flat, rectangular stamp seals as well as many other objects including tools, tablets, ornaments and pottery. [...] These signs were written in many ways, including carving, <b>chiseling,</b> painting and embossing, on objects made of many different materials, such as soapstone, bone, shell, terracotta, sandstone, copper, silver and gold. Often, animals such as bulls, elephants, rhinoceros, water buffaloes and the mythical unicorn accompanied the text on seals, to help the illiterate identify where a particular seal came from.|$|E

[...] The communique finished with the words: [...] "La guerra continua. L'Italia tiene fede alla parola data" [...] ("The war goes on. [...] Italy will be true to its word"). [...] After the end of the transmission, the population slowly understood what was going on. [...] Thus Paolo Monelli, writer and journalist, describes what happened in the capital: [...] All over Italy, men and women went on the roads, <b>chiseling</b> away the Fascist emblems and removing propaganda posters from the buildings. [...] In Rome, the government locked up the most important Fascists in Forte Boccea (at that time Rome's military jail). [...] The lack of violence was remarkable: except for a few cases, the people's revenge was limited to tearing off from the jackets of the Fascists the [...] "bug" [...] (the Fascist pin) or forcing them to toast to Badoglio. [...] So, without firing one shot, fell the man and the party who had dominated Italy for the last 21 years: {{as one of the most}} important Italian intellectuals, Ranuccio Bianchi Bandinelli, wrote in his diary in those days: [...] "Behind the façade there was nothing. [...] The first actor took his large cardboard head off and his idiot servants could be sent home with a cuff".|$|E
