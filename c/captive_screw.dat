50|$|Screw clamps {{consist of}} a {{galvanized}} or stainless steel band into which a screw thread pattern has been cut or pressed. One end of the band contains a <b>captive</b> <b>screw.</b> The clamp is put around the hose or tube to be connected, with the loose end being fed into a narrow space between the band and the <b>captive</b> <b>screw.</b> When the screw is turned, it acts as a worm drive pulling the threads of the band, causing the band to tighten around the hose (or when screwed the opposite direction, to loosen). Screw clamps are normally used for hoses 1/2 inch diameter and up, with other clamps used for smaller hoses.|$|E
50|$|Wire clamps {{consist of}} a piece of heavy wire, {{typically}} steel, first bent into a tight U, then formed into a ring shape with one end overlapping the other, and finally the ends bent outwards and cut. A captive nut is attached to one end, and a <b>captive</b> <b>screw</b> to the other. When the screw is tightened, the overlapped ends of the wire are pushed apart, tightening the wire loop around the hose. For an explanation of why this design is used, see the section on sealing the connection.|$|E
500|$|The Mac Pro had {{room for}} four {{internal}} 3.5" [...] SATA-300 hard drives in four internal [...] "bays". The hard drives were mounted on individual trays (also known as [...] "sleds") by <b>captive</b> <b>screws.</b> A {{set of four}} drive trays was supplied with each machine. Adding hard drives to the system did not require cables to be attached as the drive {{was connected to the}} system simply by being inserted into the corresponding drive slot. A case lock {{on the back of the}} system locked the disks trays into their positions.|$|R
50|$|The term {{jackscrew}} is {{also used}} for the <b>captive</b> <b>screws</b> that draw the two parts of D-subminiature electrical connectors together and hold them mated. When unscrewed, they allow the connector halves to be taken apart. These small jackscrews may have ordinary screw heads or extended heads (also making them thumbscrews) that allow the user's fingers to turn the jackscrew. Furthermore, the head sometimes has an internal female thread, with the male externally threaded screw shaft extending from that. The threaded-head type {{can be used to}} panel-mount one connector and provide a means to attach the mating connector to the first connector.|$|R

A case lock {{on the back of the}} system locked the disks trays into their positions.The Mac Pro also supported Serial ATA solid-state drives (SSD) in the 4 hard drive bays via an SSD-to-hard drive sled adapter (mid-2010 models and later), and by third-party solutions for earlier models (e.g., by an adapter/bracket which plugged into an unused PCIe slot). Various 2.5-inch SSD drive capacities and configurations were available as options.The Mac Pro was also available with an optional hardware RAID card. With the addition of a SAS controller card or SAS RAID controller card, SAS drives could be directly connected to the system's SATA ports.Two optical drive bays were provided, each with a corresponding SATA port and an Ultra ATA/100 port.The Mac Pro had one PATA port and could support two PATA devices in the optical drive bays. It had a total of six SATA ports - four were connected to the system's drive bays, and two were not connected. The extra SATA ports could be put into service through the use of after-market extender cables to connect internal optical drives, or to provide eSATA ports with the use of an eSATA bulkhead connector. However, the two extra SATA ports were unsupported and disabled under Boot Camp.A built-to-order Mac Pro could be configured with up to 8 TB of storage (4 × 2 TB disks) or 2 TB (4 × 512 GB SSD).|$|R
