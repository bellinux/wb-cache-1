5|$|Picked {{by many to}} lose {{a first-round}} match-up against Old Dominion, Butler {{advanced}} on a last-second tip-in by Howard. Howard was also <b>clutch</b> <b>in</b> their next game, hitting a free throw with a less than one second remaining to beat Pitt in a dramatic finish. Shelvin Mack scored 30 points in the win. Butler won their next game when they defeated Wisconsin. On March 26, 2011, the Bulldogs beat Florida 74–71 in overtime to earn back-to-back trips to the Final Four. On April 2, Butler beat fellow Cinderella team VCU 70–62 {{to make it to}} a second consecutive national championship game. For the second consecutive year, the Bulldogs fell in the national championship game, this time to Connecticut.|$|E
25|$|Orthalicus reses reses snails are hermaphroditic, and cross-fertilization is common. Liguus {{individuals}} {{are able to}} locate each other by following mucus trails, and Orthalicus reses reses likely do the same. They mate and nest in late summer and early fall during the wettest part of the rainy season. They lay approximately 15 eggs per <b>clutch</b> <b>in</b> a cavity that is dug into the soil humus layer, usually {{at the base of}} a tree, and take anywhere from 24 to 105 hours to deposit their eggs. The presence of this humus layer is essential for egg laying.|$|E
500|$|In 1,100games, Johnson scored 15,535points, grabbed 4,249rebounds {{and gave}} 5,499assists, {{translating}} to career averages of 14.1points, 3.9rebounds and 5.0assists per game. Known {{as a defensive}} stalwart, he was elected into nine straight All-Defensive First or Second Teams. NBA legend George Gervin said in a podcast with journalist Bill Simmons that Johnson was the hardest defender he ever played against. Johnson is also acknowledged by the NBA as a [...] "money player" [...] who was <b>clutch</b> <b>in</b> decisive moments, such as scoring 32points for his team in a Game 4 overtime victory in the 1979 NBA Finals, playing smothering defense on Magic Johnson in the 1984 NBA Finals, and converting a last-second layup in Game 5 of the 1987 Eastern Conference Finals after a Larry Bird steal.|$|E

500|$|During spring {{training}} of , Pearson injured his right ankle after accidentally stepping onto a rolling ball. [...] He was still able recover {{in time for}} the start the season and pitched solidly. [...] In arguably his best start of the year, he threw a one-hit shutout against the Chicago White Sox on May 10; he also recorded three hits and drove in two runs in the 7–0 win. [...] However, other health problems and injuries—most notably a sore arm—began to affect him, limiting his season to just [...] innings pitched in 20 games started and 2 games finished in relief. [...] Despite his many ailments, he still came up <b>clutch</b> <b>in</b> Game 3 of the 1937 World Series. [...] Facing a familiar foe in the New York Giants, Pearson stymied them to a solitary run in [...] innings pitched and received the win as the Yankees cruised to a 5–1 victory, taking a commanding 3–0 lead in the Series. [...] The Yankees eventually triumphed in 5 games, giving Pearson his second World Series ring in as many years with the team.|$|E
500|$|After {{performing}} at the 2005 South by Southwest festival, The Sword {{was signed by}} New York-based record label Kemado Records, following a recommendation by Lamb of God guitarist Mark Morton. The band released its debut album Age of Winters in February 2006, for which much of the material had been written by Cronise before the band's formation and featured on the band's early demos. In support of the album the band toured throughout 2006 and 2007, with support acts including Lacuna Coil and Trivium in the United States, Nebula and <b>Clutch</b> <b>in</b> Europe, and Lamb of God in Japan. In November 2006 a cover version of the song [...] "Freya" [...] was featured as a playable track on the video game Guitar Hero II, and the original track was later released as the band's first single in September 2007. Age of Winters did not chart, but received widely positive reviews from critics including AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia, who described the album as [...] "remarkably well-balanced and almost suspiciously immediate".|$|E

2500|$|Power {{transmission}} was {{a primary}} concern. As opposed to steam and electric engines, internal combustion engines work efficiently only within a {{limited range of}} turning frequencies. In light vehicles, this could be overcome by a <b>clutch.</b> <b>In</b> heavy railway vehicles, mechanical transmission never worked well or wore out too soon. Experience with early gasoline powered locomotives and railcars was valuable {{for the development of}} diesel traction. One step towards diesel–electric transmission was the petrol-electric vehicle, such as the Acsev Weitzer railmotor, which could operate from batteries and electric overhead wires too.

2500|$|In 1976 Lunger {{moved to}} the Team Surtees. The {{corporation}} obtained sponsorship from Chesterfield, Rand Time Corporation, the Delaware Trust Company, and Champion Spark Plugs Company. On the 1st day of qualifying for the 1976 United States Grand Prix West in Long Beach, California, Lunger averaged only [...] Driving a Surtees-Ford, he was in 21st position. He described the dilemma of negotiating the Long Beach race track, which incorporated 85 circuits from Ocean Boulevard downtown to a parking lot and to Shoreline Drive, {{not far from the}} RMS Queen Mary, and then back to Ocean Boulevard. This course is so narrow, it's like trying to drive a Sherman tank through a parking lot. Lunger failed to make the field on the 2nd day of qualifying. Only 20 cars started due to the narrowness of the Long Beach circuit. Lunger's Surtees dropped a <b>clutch</b> <b>in</b> practice and was never correctly fixed.|$|E
2500|$|When such a hub is pedaled forwards, the {{sprocket}} {{drives a}} screw which forces a clutch to move along the axle, driving the hub shell or gear assembly. [...] When pedaling is reversed, the screw drives the <b>clutch</b> <b>in</b> the opposite direction, forcing it either between two brake shoes and pressing {{them against the}} brake mantle (which is a steel liner within the hub shell), or into a split collar and expanding it against the mantle. [...] The braking surface is often steel, and the braking element brass or phosphor-bronze, as in the Birmingham-made Perry Coaster Hub. [...] Crude coaster brakes also exist, usually on children's bicycles, where a serrated steel brake cone grips {{the inside of the}} hub shell directly, with no separate brake pads or mantle. [...] These offer a less progressive action {{and are more likely to}} lock the rear wheel unintentionally.|$|E

2500|$|The type of {{work they}} do means that they require a [...] "slip-clutch" [...] which engages when the drill bit jams and {{sufficient}} torque is put onto the [...] "slip-clutch" [...] mechanism. [...] This stops the violent wrenching motion that a drill without a clutch would cause when stopped suddenly from full speed, protecting the drill from damage. [...] The slip-clutch also protects the operator, but does not always prevent injury. [...] Some manufacturers have introduced additional technology to protect the operator. [...] Hilti has a technology called [...] "ATC" [...] or [...] "Active Torque Control" [...] which works by disengaging the drive from the motor when the tool body begins to rotate excessively through the action of a secondary magnetic <b>clutch</b> <b>in</b> addition to the standard slip-clutch. [...] DeWALT has a related system called [...] "CTC" [...] or [...] "Complete Torque Control" [...] which utilizes a two-position slip-clutch so that the operator can select the lower torque setting for greater safety.|$|E
2500|$|In 1928 Daimler started {{testing the}} [...] "Fluidrive" [...] {{system in a}} bus chassis. This system, {{patented}} by Harold Sinclair in 1926, applied Hermann Föttinger's fluid flywheel to replace the <b>clutch</b> <b>in</b> the transmission systems of road vehicles. Daimler was initially interested in the fluid flywheel for use in commercial vehicles, but Martin decided to develop the system for use in passenger cars as well. Martin and Pomeroy originally intended to use the fluid flywheel with a conventional gearbox. Their consultant, Frederick Lanchester, warned them that putting a car with that combination on the market would be [...] "a terribly big gambling risk," [...] and an accident in March 1929 where a Double-Six 30 with a prototype transmission damaged a garage in Devon after Pomeroy left it idling while in gear may have shown {{the nature of this}} risk. By October 1930, when Daimler introduced the fluid flywheel on their new Light Double-Six for an extra £50, it was used with the self changing gearbox developed by W. G. Wilson. Martin and the Daimler Company patented their refinements to Sinclair's system in 1930.|$|E
2500|$|The head is {{as large}} as an {{ordinary}} flour barrel, and has {{the shape of a}} sea lion head. The neck, if the creature may be said to have a neck, is of the same diameter as the body. The mouth is on the under side of the head and is protected by two tentacle tubes about eight inches in diameter and about 30 feet long. These tubes resemble an elephant's trunk and obviously were used to <b>clutch</b> <b>in</b> a sucker like fashion any object within their reach. Another tube or tentacle of the same dimensions stands out {{on the top of the}} head. [...] Two others, one on each side, protrude from beyond the monster's neck, and extend fully 15 feet along the body and beyond the tail. The tail, which is separated and jagged with cutting points for several feet, is flanked with two more tentacles of the same dimensions as the others and 30 feet long. The eyes are under the back of the mouth instead of over it. This specimen is so badly cut up by sharks and sawfish that only the stumps of the tentacles remain, but pieces of them were found strewn for some distance on the beach, showing that the animal had a fierce battle with its foes before it was disabled and beached by the surf.|$|E

2500|$|Nicholson {{made another}} {{championship}} run in 1979, finishing third. After starting the '80 season {{by failing to}} qualify for the NHRA Winternationals and the NHRA Cajun Nationals,Don was starting {{to take a look at}} IHRA's unlimited c.i.Pro Stockers.He did qualify for the NHRA Springnationals, where he lost in the second round when his Mustang II broke,and the NHRA Summernationals, where he lost in the first round. But on July 20,He returned to the unlimited Pro Stock wars by showing up at Milan for IHRA's Northern Nationals. Don went on to win the event. At the IHRA Summernationals at Bristol,Nicholson set top speed at 169.45 on the way to a runner-up finish. He had a brand new Mustang built to replace his [...] "old" [...] Mustang II and he debuted it at Maryland International Raceway's Mountain Motor Nationals. The paint was still tacky and the car was unlettered but Don qualified the car in the show. He lost in the first round. The '81 season saw Don on a roll.He qualified first at the AHRA Winternationals and finished runner-up at that event.He did run a NHRA combination as well.The 500 c.i. qualified at the NHRA Winternationals but he lost early.He also qualified for the NHRA Gatornationals but he failed to reach the finals.Where Don really rocked was in the IHRA Pro Stock. He qualified first at Darlington for the IHRA Winternationals with 7.81-176 times.He lost in the second round to a holeshot.In April,Don went to Atlanta for the NHRA Southern Nationals.He qualified well and made it into the semi final.In the semi-final,he had a front wheel come off in the speed traps.Don showed that he could still drive by keeping the Mustang upright and not crashing.On May 3,"Dyno" [...] won his last IHRA event.The Pro Am Championships at Rockingham. His car was, by this time, known as the quickest IHRA Pro Stock car and once again he proved it by qualifying first with a 7.82-176.81.He went on to win the event.Shortly after this he sold his Pro Stock operation to Harold Denton who retained Don's services for the next few races to acquaint himself with the car.Don did quite well for Denton,wrenching him to a runner-up finish at the next IHRA event,the Springnationals at Bristol.They may have won too,had it not been for a burned out <b>clutch</b> <b>in</b> the final. He continued to race a Pro Stock Ford until 1980. Nicholson made a [...] in 1984 in an Oldsmobile. He returned in 1988 in the nostalgia tour in a version of 1962 Chevrolet Bel Air, which he was still campaigning in 2001. He also made some appearances in a Pro Stock Truck in 1998 and 1999.|$|E

Their nests are found between 30 - 50 cm above the water, and are found to be in close proximity to other nest-like platforms. Eggs are lain from late August to the end of January, with a clutch size of between 2 and 5 eggs. Both the male and female incubate the eggs for between 20 - 22 days. It is believed there is evidence to suggest that clutch size increases as the season progresses; from 3 egg <b>clutches</b> <b>in</b> August and September to 5 egg <b>clutches</b> <b>in</b> December.
