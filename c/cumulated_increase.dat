Why and how is the ill-treatment {{with children}} repeated from generation to generation? Is it {{the effect of the}} "pure hazard"? Can we find factors of "vulnerability"? In the light of the concepts of transmission and honesty essentially based on the systemic references, the article examines the mechanisms concerned which, if they are <b>cumulated,</b> <b>increase</b> the risk of repetition.

40|$|We use a panel {{model to}} explore the trade spillovers from fiscal policy shocks in Europe. We {{distinguish}} between a direct and an indirect effect of the fiscal shock. The direct effect amounts to a government spending increase being spent directly on foreign products or a tax reduction raising disposable income and, thereby, boosting exports by other countries. The indirect effect arises because the fiscal impulse stimulates economic activity, which in turn leads to higher imports. We find that, empirically, the direct effects are unimportant, while the indirect effects are statistically and economically significant. To evaluate the indirect effect we complement a panel trade model with a panel VAR model in GDP, net taxes, and government spending. A domestic spending impulse equal to 1 % of GDP overall leads to a 1. 4 % cumulative increase in bilateral exports to this country, whereas an equal-size reduction in net taxes causes a 0. 3 % <b>cumulated</b> <b>increase</b> in bilateral exports. Further, averaged across all partner countries, {{the effects of a}} 1 % of GDP fiscal stimulus in Germany are estimated at 0. 12 % on foreign GDP for a spending increase and 0. 03 % for a net tax cut...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{climatology}} of Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) chlorophyll data {{over the}} Indian Ocean {{is used to}} examine the bloom variability patterns, identifying spatio-temporal contrasts in bloom appearance and intensity and relating them to the variability of the physical environment. The near-surface ocean dynamics is assessed using an ocean general circulation model (OGCM). It is found that over {{a large part of the}} basin, the seasonal cycle of phytoplankton is characterized by two consecutive blooms, one during the summer monsoon, and the other during the winter monsoon. Each bloom is described by means of two parameters, the timing of the bloom onset and the <b>cumulated</b> <b>increase</b> in chlorophyll during the bloom. This yields a regional image of the influence of the two monsoons on phytoplankton, with distinct regions emerging in summer and in winter. By comparing the bloom patterns with dynamical features derived from the OGCM (horizontal and vertical velocities and mixed-layer depth), it is shown that the regional structure of the blooms is intimately linked with the horizontal and vertical circulations forced by the monsoons. Moreover, this comparison permits the assessment of some of the physical mechanisms that drive the bloom patterns, and points out the regions where these mechanisms need to be further investigated. A new outcome of this study is that in many distinct areas, time shifts of 1 - 2 months are witnessed in the timing of the bloom onsets in adjoining regions. These time shifts are rationalized in terms of horizontal advection and Rossby wave propagation...|$|E

40|$|This paper assembles an {{original}} panel {{of data from}} 2, 500 restaurants in Italy over the 1998 - 2004 period. The main objective is to study whether the euro cash changeover {{had an impact on}} individual pricing behaviour, as it seems to be perceived by consumers. Although the sample is not representative of the whole sector, our interest stems from the possibility of gaining deeper insights from individual data, {{as well as from the}} fact that restaurant prices were at the centre of the public discussion. First, the paper analyses the distribution of price changes in several years, to identify what features may contribute to explain the widespread perception of a large effect of the introduction of the euro on prices. Second, the paper discusses the economic mechanisms that may help explaining the impact of the cash changeover on prices. The data show that restaurant prices recorded sizeable increases in both 2001 and 2002 (around 10 % and 9 %, respectively). The <b>cumulated</b> <b>increase</b> in the price of a meal between 1998 and 2003 is substantial (the index rises by 40 %). The changeover might have focused the public attention over this medium-run trend, prompting the attribution of the whole increase to the introduction of the euro. The analysis suggests that such increases reflect in part unfavourable developments on the costs side (strong increases in unit labour costs and fresh food inputs in both years) and strong increases in demand (especially in 2001). Part of the restaurant price increase recorded in 2002, however, does seem ascribable to the effect of the changeover. We find evidence consistent with a ‘menu-cost’ hypothesis for pricing behaviour: the rise in the average meal price is mainly due to a greater fraction of agents who revise their price, rather than to greater individual price revisions. Moreover, more market power (as proxied by a local concentration index) is associated with greater than average price increases during the changeover. A simple interpretation is proposed for this finding, which may also explain why the effects of the cash changeover may have been especially pronounced in this industry as opposed to more competitive ones. euro changeover; inflation; menu cost...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Identifying {{predictive}} biomarkers of drug {{response is}} of key importance to improve therapy management and drug selection in cancer therapy. To date, {{the influence of}} drug exposure and pharmacogenetic variants on sorafenib-induced toxicity remains poorly documented. The aim of this pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) {{study was to investigate}} the relationship between early toxicity and drug exposure or pharmacogenetic variants in unselected adult outpatients treated with single-agent sorafenib for advanced solid tumors. METHODS: Toxicity was recorded in 54 patients on days 15 and 30 after treatment initiation and sorafenib exposure was assessed in 51 patients. The influence of polymorphisms in CYP 3 A 5, UGT 1 A 9, ABCB 1 and ABCG 2 was examined in relation to sorafenib exposure and toxicity. Clinical characteristics, drug exposure and pharmacogenetic variants were tested univariately for association with toxicities. Candidate variables with p< 0. 1 were analyzed in a multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Gender was the sole parameter independently associated with sorafenib exposure (p = 0. 0008). Multivariate analysis showed that <b>increased</b> <b>cumulated</b> sorafenib (AUC(cum)) was independently associated with any grade ≥ 3 toxicity (p = 0. 037); UGT 1 A 9 polymorphism (rs 17868320) with grade ≥ 2 diarrhea (p = 0. 015) and female gender with grade ≥ 2 hand-foot skin reaction (p = 0. 018). Using ROC curve, the threshold AUC(cum) value of 3, 161 mg/L. h was associated with the highest risk to develop any grade ≥ 3 toxicity (p = 0. 018). CONCLUSION: In this preliminary study, <b>increased</b> <b>cumulated</b> drug exposure and UGT 1 A 9 polymorphism (rs 17868320) identified patients at high risk for early sorafenib-induced severe toxicity.

The Pb isotopic composition is extremely nonradiogenic {{compared with those}} of typical Apollo mare basalts. The Pb-Pb, U-Pb, and Th-Pb ages are concordant at 3. 94 Ga. The U-Pb data from maskelynitized plagioclase does not plot on the internal isochrons defined by other mineral separates, indicating that it was disturbed by a later shock event(s). The U-Th-Pb systematics of Asuka- 31,combined with previous results, suggest a scenario for the early Pb isotope evolution of the Moon. According to the currently popular hypothesis for lunar origin, following a collision between the Earth and another large planetesimal, the Moon was formed mainly from the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s mantle and partially from the other impactor. The primary ^ U/^ Pb (μ) value of the Moon had been increased four to five times that of the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s mantle value (∿ 8) by volatilization of Pb during the impact. Further depletion of Pb within the Moon 2 ̆ 7 s mantle is believed to have occurred during lunar core formation. The chalcophile behavior of Pb and large partition coefficient of Pb in silicate minerals compared to those of U and Th helped to decrease μ values of early cumulates that formed from the magma ocean and settled in the deep lunar mantle.

40|$|After injury, {{regrowth}} of axons in mammalian adult {{central nervous}} system is highly limited. However, in monkeys subjected to unilateral cervical lesion (C 7 -C 8 level), neutralization of an important neurite outgrowth inhibitor, Nogo-A, stimulated axonal sprouting caudal to the lesion, accompanied by enhanced functional recovery of manual dexterity, compared with lesioned monkeys treated with a control antibody (Freund et al.

The corticospinal tract was labeled by injecting the anterograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine into the contralesional motor cortex. The corticospinal axons were interrupted {{at the level of}} the lesion, accompanied by retrograde axonal degeneration (axon dieback), reflected by the presence of terminal retraction bulbs. The number of terminal retraction bulbs was lower in anti-Nogo-A antibody treated monkeys, and, when present, they were found closer to the lesion than in control-antibody treated monkeys.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between late Holocene landscape development and early human {{interaction by means of}} geomorphological and sedimentological analyses supported by GIS modelling operations. The selected geoarchives are sedimentary valley fills of two subwatersheds located in the upper Turano River drainage basin (60 km northeast of Rome, Italy), where humans settled at least since the earliest classic period. First the alluvial plains were identified and mapped through multiple GIS operations. Thereafter, 12 cores were taken from the alluvial plains, collecting in total 68 m of alluvial profiles. By sedimentological analyses (i. e., grain size, carbon determination) together with 36 AMS-radiocarbon dates, we identified phases when changes in the geomorphological evolution of the study area occurred. Starting around 4200 cal BP, eight distinct clusters of <b>increased</b> <b>cumulated</b> probability density functions of the 14 C dates were observed, representing enhanced alluvial deposition and/or fluvial activity. The shift from a phase of prevailing biostasy to a period of anthropic rhexistasy occurred after 4200 cal BP in the Rio di Riccetto and around 2200 cal BP in the more remote Ovito watersheds. Dividing the alluvial sediment volumes by the potential erosion areas and assuming a sediment delivery ratio (SDR) between 0. 21 and 0. 46, we obtained an average late Holocene surface lowering of 370 to 540 mm in the Rio di Riccetto and 400 to 510 mm in the Ovito watersheds.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{reviews the}} geodynamic {{concepts}} and models related to transform continental margins, and their implications {{on the structure}} of these margins. Simple kinematic models of transform faulting associated with continental rifting and oceanic accretion allow to define three successive stages of evolution, including intra-continental transform faulting, active transform margin, and passive transform margin. Each part of the transform margin experiences these three stages, but the evolution is diachronous along the margin. Both the duration of each stage and the <b>cumulated</b> strike-slip deformation <b>increase</b> from one extremity of the margin (inner corner) to the other (outer corner). Initiation of transform faulting is related to the obliquity between the trend of the lithospheric deformed zone and the relative displacement of the lithospheric plates involved in divergence. In this oblique setting, alternating transform and divergent plate boundaries correspond to spatial partitioning of the deformation. Both obliquity and the timing of partitioning influence the shape of transform margins. Oblique margin can be defined when oblique rifting is followed by oblique oceanic accretion. In this case, no transform margin should exist in the prolongation of the oceanic fracture zones. Vertical displacements along transform margins were mainly studied to explain the formation of marginal ridges. Numerous models were proposed, one of the most used is being based on thermal exchanges between the oceanic and the continental lithospheres across the transform fault. But this model is compatible neither with numerical computation including flexural behavior of the lithosphere nor with timing of vertical displacements and the lack of heating related to the passing of the oceanic accretion axis as recorded by the Côte d'Ivoire-Ghana marginal ridge. Enhanced models are still needed. They should better take into account the erosion on the continental slope, and the level of coupling of the transform continental margin with the adjacent oceanic lithosphere...|$|R

The results suggest that between 1901 and 2002, the modeled NPP has significantly increased by 5. 5 - 8. 5 Tg C yr(- 1) (15 - 20 % growth). Such increase in NPP has caused an <b>increased</b> <b>cumulated</b> terrestrial C storage by about 5 - 11 Pg C. About 50 - 70 % fraction of this total C sink is located in vegetation biomass. Our modeling results also suggest that 40 - 60 % of the accumulate C uptake of the 20 th century is credited to the period of 1980 - 2002. Although all models tend to agree at the continental scale that East Asia played a role of net C sink (0. 14 - 0. 18 Pg C yr(- 1)) during 1980 s and 1990 s, the trends of NEP are different among the models. Both LPJ and ORCHIDEE estimate a slight but insignificant NEP decrease from 1980 to 2002 (P> 0. 05), while SDGVM estimates a statistically significant increase in NEP {{at a rate of}} 0. 005 Pg C yr(- 2) (P< 0. 05). Also, there is no consensus among models on the dominant driving factors controlling interannual variation in NPP and NEP at the continental scale, implying that more efforts are needed to investigate the vulnerability of the East Asian terrestrial carbon cycle.

40|$|Fast {{economic}} growth - {{in excess of}} 5 % per year - continues in most New EU Member States (NMS). Growth in Bulgaria and Romania (which joined the EU on 1 January 2007) was also accelerating throughout 2006. Everywhere, except Hungary, GDP growth has been driven predominantly by domestic demand. External trade, which significantly boosted GDP growth {{in a number of}} NMS in 2005, has been losing significance and continues to be a drag on growth in Bulgaria and Romania. wiiw growth forecasts of the GDP in individual NMS in 2007 and 2008 are looking very good. It is expected that household consumption will continue to rise strongly. Rising employment and wages (strengthening under the impact of emerging labour shortages) will be supportive. Rising remittances of migrant workers would be adding to fast rising consumer spending. Gross fixed capital investment is expected to remain strong in most NMS. With the exception of Hungary, fiscal policies will not interfere with real growth. The slight deceleration of growth in the EU- 15 expected in 2007 is not likely to restrict the growth of both NMS exports and their overall GDP too much as further gains on industrial unit labour costs are expected. Given the ongoing structural changes and quality improvements in production and exports, the NMS should continue to gain market shares even despite further currency appreciation. However, growth in imports responding to growing domestic demand will be reducing the contribution of trade to GDP growth. This contribution is likely to be negative in the 'old' NMS, but small. In Bulgaria and Romania, the contributions of external trade to growth will be negative and large. Unlike the 'old' NMS, these two countries will be running very high current account deficits and rely on rising private foreign debt in order to finance consumption and investments. The risk of making big errors in growth forecasts for the 'old' NMS is fairly low. Their fundamentals are nowadays much sounder than in the past (Hungary being temporarily an exception). The rates of inflation are quite low and firmly under control. Interest rate differentials vs. the major international currencies are also low, falling, or even negative. Incentives for potentially destabilizing speculative capital inflows (and outflows) are therefore weak. Nominal currency appreciation is likely to continue, signifying the NMS' economic strength rather than potential weakness. The estimates of GDP growth rates for Bulgaria and Romania may be less certain. Both countries are growing turbulently. But, as in the Baltic countries, their growth is to a large extent induced by booming household consumption which is credit-driven and fed by excessive imports. Yet the experience of the Baltic countries indicates that such a type of growth can go on for a very long time. However, there are many examples of such debt-financed expansions coming to a rather sticky end. Thus, it might come as no surprise were the rising debt burden to put a lid on further expansion in Bulgaria and Romania. The Balkan economies continue to grow despite political risks and external shocks. Consumption is the main source of growth, with investments also increasingly contributing. High exports are accompanied by high imports and external balances remain strongly negative. Price and exchange rate stability, however, remain manageable because of strong growth of productivity and downward pressure on wages from excess supply of labour. The expectation of sustained growth is supporting growth of foreign investments in privatized assets but also increasingly in green-field projects. Fast rising prices of assets and declining interest rates due to strong credit expansion are proving worrisome for the central banks, which fear asset bubbles and weaknesses in the banking sector. These challenges are met with a tightening of monetary policy, which has led to some moderation of growth rates. Overall prospects are positive for growth and stability in the short and medium run. The main risks to positive expectations emanate from remaining political problems and from doubts about the process of EU integration and accession. The major political risk is connected with the upcoming decision on the Kosovo status. If that risk is managed well and if other political problems are addressed that will make it possible for all the countries in the region to either sign association agreements with the EU or continue or start negotiations on membership in the EU, rather positive economic news should be coming out steadily from the Balkans. That would also help the region to address the serious social risks, especially those connected with high or very high unemployment. Overall, prospects for growth are good in the short and medium run and prospects for stability are risky in the short run and good in the medium run. The region as a whole {{should be included in the}} EU by 2015, except perhaps for Kosovo and Turkey. Russian {{economic growth}} was once more over 6 % in 2006, the <b>cumulated</b> GDP has <b>increased</b> by more than 40 % since 2000. GDP growth is driven by the surging private consumption, recently also by investments. Owing to sluggish exports and booming imports, the contribution of real net exports to GDP growth has been negative already since 2003. The economic outlook remains positive with both consumption and investments (including FDI) growing rapidly. However, wiiw expects growth to settle between 5 % and 6 % in the coming years. With more oil and gas money as well as power consolidation at home, Russia's self confidence will grow further. In Ukraine, GDP growth accelerated markedly in 2006; macroeconomic imbalances were largely avoided and the 'gas price shock' reasonably well digested. Foreign debt increased by some 25 %, reaching 47 % of GDP by the end of the year - mainly caused by the banking sector's rapidly growing external borrowing, possibly associated with the growing presence of foreign banks. Inflation apart, the country's short-term economic outlook is good. In 2007 2008 we expect economic growth close to 6 %. Despite the persistent stand-off between the president and the prime minister, the country is now living through a period of its greatest political stability since the 'orange revolution'. In China, GDP grew by 10. 7 %, driven by investment and an exploding trade surplus but supported by private consumption as well. For 2007 - 08, prospects remain good but a slight deceleration of growth may occur, due to a certain slowing down of investment and measures to contain the trade surplus.
