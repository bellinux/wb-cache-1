25|$|Unit trust: A trust {{where the}} {{beneficiaries}} (called unitholders) each possess a certain share (called units) and can direct the trustee to pay money to {{them out of}} the trust property according to the number of units they possess. A unit trust is a vehicle for <b>collective</b> <b>investment,</b> rather than disposition, as the person who gives the property to the trustee is also the beneficiary.|$|E
25|$|In 2003 a new {{separate}} {{division of}} the Central Bank, with its own Chairman, Chief Executive, and board, was established as the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority. This was as a compromise between those who favoured a fully independent regulator and those who believed the Central Bank should maintain full control of regulation of the financial services industry.

25|$|A {{synthetic}} ETF has counterparty risk, {{because the}} counterparty is contractually obligated {{to match the}} return on the index. The deal is arranged with collateral posted by the swap counterparty. A potential hazard is that the investment bank offering the ETF might post its own collateral, and that collateral could be of dubious quality. Furthermore, the investment bank could use its own trading desk as counterparty. These types of set-ups are not allowed under the European guidelines, Undertakings for <b>Collective</b> <b>Investment</b> in Transferable Securities (UCITS), so the investor should look for UCITS III-compliant funds.|$|E
25|$|Since 2 May 2013, after {{complaints}} from depositors, state government ordered SIT to broaden its investigation and conduct {{search and seizure}} at offices of MPS Greenery Developers Ltd and Prayag Infotech Hi-Rise Ltd, which were running unregistered <b>collective</b> <b>investment</b> schemes similar to Saradha Group. By 6 May 2013, police had arrested directors of Ponzi companies ATM Group and Annex Infrastructure Pvt Ltd on charges of defrauding depositors. According to news-reports, {{at the time of}} handing the Saradha Group investigation to CBI, SIT had arrested 11 people, had traced 224 immovable properties, seized 54 vehicles and had filed charge sheet in almost 300 pending cases.|$|E
25|$|SEBI first confronted Saradha Group in 2009. Saradha Group {{adapted by}} {{opening up to}} 200 new {{companies}} to create more cross-holdings. This created an extremely complex tiered corporate structure to confound SEBI by hampering their ability to consolidate blame. SEBI persisted in its investigation through 2010. Saradha Group reacted by changing its methods of raising capital. In West Bengal, Jharkhand, Assam and Chhattisgarh, it began operating variations of <b>collective</b> <b>investment</b> schemes (CIS) involving tourism packages, forward travel and hotel booking timeshare credit transfer, real estate, infrastructure finance, and motorcycle manufacturing. Investors were rarely informed about {{the true nature of}} their investments. Instead, many were told they would get high returns after a fixed period. With other investors, the investment was fraudulently sold {{in the form of a}} chit fund. Under the Chit Fund Act (1982), chit funds are regulated by state governments rather than SEBI.|$|E

2500|$|The Saradha Group {{financial}} scandal (...) was a {{major financial}} scam and alleged political scandal caused {{by the collapse of}} a Ponzi scheme run by Saradha Group, a consortium of over 200 private companies that was believed to be running <b>collective</b> <b>investment</b> schemes popularly but incorrectly referred to as chit funds in Eastern India.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{a history}} of Ponzi schemes, the {{continuing}} decline in interest rates, rapid financialisation of household savings, lack of financial literacy and investor awareness, political patronage, absence of adequate legal deterrence, and regulatory arbitrage encouraged the growth of similar companies. These companies either raised their funds through legitimate channels such as <b>collective</b> <b>investment</b> schemes, non-convertible debentures and preference shares, or illegitimately through hoax financial instruments such as teak bonds, potato bonds or fictitious ventures in agro-export, construction and manufacturing. , 80% of multi-level marketing and finance schemes against which complaints have been received are based in West Bengal, giving the state the title of [...] "Ponzi capital of India". It is estimated that these Ponzi funds have amassed around [...] from unsuspecting depositors in Eastern India.|$|E
2500|$|SEBI {{warned the}} state {{government}} of West Bengal about Saradha Group's chit fund activities in 2011, again prompting Saradha Group to change its methods. This time, it acquired and sold large numbers of shares of various listed companies then embezzled the {{proceeds of the sale}} through accounts which [...] have not been identified. Meanwhile, Saradha Group started laundering a large portion of its funds to Dubai, South Africa and Singapore. By 2012, SEBI was able to classify the group's activities as <b>collective</b> <b>investment</b> schemes rather than chit fundsand demanded that it immediately stop operating its investment schemes until it received [...] permission to operate from SEBI. Saradha Group did not comply with this ruling and continued to operate until its collapse in April 2013.|$|E

2500|$|In March 2013, Central {{corporate}} affairs minister Sachin Pilot {{said in the}} Lok Sabhathe lower house of the Parliament of Indiathat his ministry has received complaints against West Bengal's Saradha Group and many other companies for their involvement in Ponzi or multi-layer-marketing schemes. No action was taken until after the fraud was uncovered, when many measures were announced. On 25 April 2013, India's Income Tax department and Ministry of Corporate Affairs started separate investigation into the Saradha affair and similar Ponzi funds masquerading as NBFCs or CISs. On the same day, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) registered a money laundering case under {{the provisions of the}} Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) at its Guwahati office because the Assam police has registered an FIR against Saradha Group to investigate depositors' allegations of financial irregularities. On 1 May 2013, commenting on the regulatory loopholes, the Chairman of SEBI said, [...] "there should be one single regulator for entire <b>collective</b> <b>investment</b> schemes".|$|E
2500|$|The Belgium {{securities}} tax {{applies to}} certain transactions concluded or executed in Belgium through a professional intermediary, {{to the extent}} that they relate to public funds, irrespective of their (Belgian or foreign) origin. The [...] "tax on stock exchange transactions" [...] is not due upon subscription of new securities (primary market transactions). Both buyers and sellers are subject to the tax. The tax rate varies in accordance with the type of transactions. A 0.09% tax (subject to a maximum of €1.300 per transaction) is charged for distributing shares of investment companies, certificates of contractual investment funds, bonds of the Belgian public debt or the public debt of foreign states, nominative or bearer bonds, certificates of bonds, etc. A 1.32% tax (subject to a maximum of €4.000 per transaction) is charged for accumulating shares of investment companies and 0.27% (subject to a maximum of €1.600 per transaction) for any other securities (such as shares). Transactions made for its own account by non-resident taxpayers and by some financial institutions, such as banks, insurance companies, organizations for financing pensions (OFPs) or <b>collective</b> <b>investment</b> are exempted from the tax.|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} governance standards are rights vote for {{who is on the}} board of directors for investors of labour and capital. A Draft Fifth Company Law Directive proposed in 1972, which would have required EU-wide rights for employees to vote for boards stalled mainly because it attempted to require two-tier board structures, although most EU member states have codetermination today with unified boards. The Shareholder Rights Directive 2007 requires shareholders be able to make proposals, ask questions at meetings, vote by proxy and vote through intermediaries. This has become increasingly important as most company shares are held by institutional investors (primarily asset managers or banks, depending on the member state) who are holding [...] "other people's money". A large proportion of this money comes from employees and other people saving for retirement, but who do not have an effective voice. Unlike Switzerland after a 2013 people's initiative, or the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act 2010 in relation to brokers, the EU has not yet prevented intermediaries casting votes without express instructions of beneficiaries. This concentrates power into a small number of financial institutions, and creates the potential for conflicts of interest where financial institutions sell retirement, banking or products to companies in which they cast votes with other people's money. A series of rights for ultimate investors exist in the Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision Directive 2003. This requires duties of disclosure in how a retirement fund is run, funding and insurance to guard against insolvency, but not yet that voting rights are only cast on the instructions of investors. By contrast, the Undertakings for <b>Collective</b> <b>Investment</b> in Transferable Securities Directive 2009 does suggest that investors in a mutual fund or ("collective investment scheme") should control the voting rights. The UCITS Directive 2009 is primarily concerned with creating a [...] "passport". If a firm complies with rules on authorisation, and governance of the management and investment companies in an overall fund structure, it can sell its shares in a <b>collective</b> <b>investment</b> scheme across the EU. This forms a broader package of Directives on securities and financial market regulation, much of which has been shaped by experience in the banking crisis of 2007–08. Additional rules on remuneration practices, separating depositary bodies in firms from management and investment companies, and more penalties for violations were inserted in 2014. These measures are meant to decrease the risk to investors that an investment goes insolvent. The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2004 applies to other businesses selling financial instruments. It requires similar authorisation procedures to have a [...] "passport" [...] to sell in any EU country, and transparency of financial contracts through duties to disclose material information about products being sold, including disclosure of potential conflicts of interest with clients. The Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive 2011 applies to firms with massive quantities of capital, over €100million, essentially hedge funds and private equity firms. Similarly, it requires authorisation to sell products EU wide, and then basic transparency requirements on products being sold, requirements in remuneration policies for fund managers that are perceived to reduce [...] "risk" [...] or make pay [...] "performance" [...] related. They do not, however, require limits to pay. There are general prohibitions on conflicts of interest, and specialised prohibitions on asset stripping. The Solvency II Directive 2009 is directed particularly at insurance firms, requiring minimum capital and best practices in valuation of assets, again to avoid insolvency. The Capital Requirements Directives contain analogous rules, with a similar goals, for banks. To administer the new rules, the European System of Financial Supervision was established in 2011, and consists of three main branches: the European Securities and Markets Authority in Paris, the European Banking Authority in London and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority in Frankfurt.|$|E

50|$|The {{funds are}} {{open-ended}} investments made available through life assurance companies. Unlike most <b>collective</b> <b>investments</b> {{there is no}} independent body tasked with safeguarding the assets.

2500|$|When {{trust assets}} are {{mixed up with}} {{property}} of the trustee, or other people, the general approach of the courts is to resolve the issues in favour of the wronged beneficiary. For example, in Re Hallett's Estate, a solicitor sold £2145 worth of bonds he was meant to hold for his client and {{put the money in}} his account. Although money had subsequently been drawn and redeposited in the account, the balance of £3000 was enough to return all the money to his clients. According to Lord Jessel MR, a fiduciary [...] "cannot be heard to say that he took away the trust money when he had a right to take away his own money". Again, in Re Oatway, a trustee who took money and made a deposit with his bank account, and then bought shares which rose in value, was held by Joyce J to have used the beneficiary's money on the shares. This was the most beneficial result possible. When trust assets are mixed up with money from other beneficiaries, the courts have had more difficulty. Originally, by the rule in Clayton's case, it was said that the money taken out of a bank account would be presumed to come from the first person's money that was put in. So in that case it meant that when a banking partnership, before it went insolvent, made payments to one of its depositors, Mr Clayton, the payments made discharged the debt of the first partner that died. However, this [...] "first in, first out" [...] rule is essentially disapplied in all but the simplest cases. In Barlow Clowes International Ltd v Vaughan Woolf LJ held that it would not apply if it might be 'impracticable or result in injustice', or if it ran contrary to the parties intentions. There, Vaughan was one of a multitude of investors in Barlow Clowes' managed fund portfolios. Their investments had been numerous, of different sizes and over long periods of time, and each investor knew that they had bought into a <b>collective</b> <b>investment</b> scheme. Accordingly, when Barlow Clowes went insolvent, each investor was held to simply share the loss proportionately, or pari passu. A third alternative, said by Leggatt LJ to generally be fairer (though complex to compute) is to share losses through a [...] "rolling pari passu" [...] system. Given the complexity of the accounts, and the trading of each investor, this approach was not used in Vaughan, but it would have seen a proportionate reduction of all account holders' interest at each step of an account's depletion. A significant topic of debate, however, is whether the courts should allow tracing into an asset which has been bought on credit. The weight of authority suggests this is possible, either through subrogation, or on the justification that the assets of a recipient who pays off a debt on a thing are [...] "swollen". In Bishopsgate Investment Management Ltd v Homan, however, the Court of Appeal held that pensioners of the crooked newspaper owner, Robert Maxwell, who had their money stolen, could not have a charge over the money in whose overdrawn accounts their money was deposited. It was said that when money was put into an overdrawn account, it was simply exhausted, and even if the money had been later used for the company's purposes, the law must end the tracing exercise. This result was doubted by the Privy Council in Brazil v Durant International Corporation, as Lord Toulson advised that backwards tracing is possible if there is [...] "a coordination between the depletion of the trust fund and the acquisition of the asset which is the subject of the tracing claim, looking at the whole transaction, such as to warrant the court attributing the value of the interest acquired to the misuse of the trust fund." ...|$|E

50|$|LTS' offer a {{significant}} advantage over <b>collective</b> <b>investment</b> schemes. <b>Collective</b> <b>investment</b> schemes (or CIS or UCIS) come in many legal forms. What {{is common in}} each legal form is {{the existence of a}} shareholder register; according to the laws of most jurisdictions, an entry in the shareholder register must be accompanied by a signed declaration to invest. Equally, a transfer of shares in a <b>collective</b> <b>investment</b> scheme is usually not allowed without the signed consent of the company. These procedural requirements limit the ability of shareholders to trade their shares. A small subset of <b>collective</b> <b>investment</b> schemes are electronically tradable through stock exchanges (most notably REITs). However, the vast majority of <b>collective</b> <b>investment</b> schemes require these procedural steps.|$|E
50|$|These {{regulations}} only allow {{investment in}} transferable securities (e.g., listed securities, other <b>collective</b> <b>investment</b> schemes, or certificates of deposit). This ensured that ICVCs fell {{within the scope}} of the Undertakings for <b>Collective</b> <b>Investment</b> in Transferable Securities Directives (UCITS).|$|E
50|$|Each {{open-ended}} <b>collective</b> <b>investment</b> scheme {{has its own}} fund regulations (often {{referred to}} also as prospectus). Contractual funds are regulated by the <b>collective</b> <b>investment</b> contract (e.g. fund contract). In SICAVs, it is the articles of association and the investment regulations.|$|E
50|$|In France, {{commonly}} referred to as FCP or F.C.P., these financial instruments are <b>collective</b> <b>investments</b> that are similar to the Sicav. They are not investment companies; they are more like open partnerships. They have no independent legal status but exist as a set of defined relationships between investors, managers and custodian. They invest in different financial instruments, but {{they do not have the}} tax status of the SICAV.|$|R
30|$|These {{institutional}} investors are pension funds, {{insurance companies and}} undertakings for <b>collective</b> <b>investments</b> in transferable securities (UCITS).

5000|$|The term asset {{management}} {{is often used}} to refer to the <b>investment</b> management of <b>collective</b> <b>investments,</b> while the more generic fund management may refer to all forms of institutional investment as well as investment management for private investors.
