The transmission principle, the parameter of extension ratio and meshing conditions of bracing screw and <b>connecting</b> <b>screw</b> are introduced. The carrying capacity is analyzed by simulation. The results show that number of <b>connecting</b> <b>screw</b> is key of parameter ratio and can be adjusted, and the large carrying capacity and accurate positioning meet the special requirement of big trip overloading linear drive applications...|$|E

Methods:The biomechanical behaviour of 4. 2 × 13 mm dental implants, <b>connecting</b> <b>screw,</b> straight and 15 ° and 25 ° angulated abutments subjected to static loads, in contact with high and poor bone qualities was evaluated by FEA. Results: The lowest stress value {{was found in the}} system composed by implants and straight abut-ments loaded with a vertical force, while the highest stress value was found in implants with 15 ° angulated abutment loaded with an angulated force. In addition, we found the lower the bone quality, the higher the distribution of the stress within the bone. Conclusion: Spiral family implants can be used successfully in low bone quality but applying a straight force is recommended...|$|E

40|$|Objective: an {{efficient}} and simple methodology, based on virtual simulation and computer modelling, {{for the assessment}} and evaluation of dental implants design is proposed in this work. Materials and methods: the finite element method, a very common tool in engineering applications, {{is used for the}} evaluation the biomechanical performance of the biomedical devices. Von Mises stress is used as the main parameter to assess the suitability of the implant, when it is subjected to functional and biological loading. Also, this work reports the effects on the implant caused by geometrical variations such as length, diameter, thread, cortical bone thickness and abutment inclination. The useful-life of the implant was estimated by performing, in a virtual way, the fatigue tests required by the ISO: 14801 standard. Results: for all the analyzed cases, maximum stress was obtained at the <b>connecting</b> <b>screw</b> under oblique loading. The estimated useful-life of the implant was around 5. 000. 000 cycles, which satisfies both ISO standard and functional requirements. Also, maximum stress was found in the compact-bone tissue surrounding the implant, which is in very good agreement with previous reports.

40|$|The demographical {{development}} {{of the population has}} also an influence on the number and image of the potential patients in dental offices: in the near future the rate of geriatric patients, looking for alternatives to improve an insufficient retention of the pre-existing prosthesis, due to an alveolar ridge atrophy, by using implants in combination with residual dentition will in total increase. Purpose: The aim of this prospective clinical trial was to evaluate the long-term behaviour of overdentures retained by an innovative telescopic retainer system named SynCone (Dentsply, Friadent, Germany). The unique property of this retainer is its prefabricated male and female part. Material and method: 23 patients (15 f, 8 m, ~ age 61. 6 years +- 12. 9 SD) were included in this study. After 3 drop-outs 21 overdentures (9 mandible, 12 maxillae, retained by 91 Ankylos-lmplants and 6 teeth) were evaluated during 36 months of function. All implants were loaded after a healing period of 3 months in the lower and 5 months in the upper jaw. The common insertion path of the cone patrix is easily achieved by a free rotation od an angulated abutment. The index-free, implant abutment joint (angulated syncone-abutment) is anti-rotational locked by a high friction grip after tightening the implant-abutment <b>connecting</b> <b>screw.</b> The prefabricated cone matrix (SynCone®-coping) was definitively assembled intraorally with a splinting frame of CoCrMo using a self curing resin. Several clinical parameters were examined during the follow-up examinations: retention, fit and maintenance of the denture; osseointegration (Periotest? and periimplant soft tissue condition (PeriotronB). Additionally a questionnaire of the participants took place every appointment. The data are statistically processed by the software STATlSTlCA (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, USA). Results: One implant in the lower jaw was lost after 25 months (survival rate 98. 91 %). The Periotest® values improved significantly (Tukey test, p< 0. 05) between the day of denture insertion and 6 months later and remain stable. The soft tissue condition shows healthy conditions according the PeriotronB values: Tukey test, p< 0. 05, significant difference between the initial values and the values 36 -months under function. Three (3) patients show initially pressure spots, but there was no further occurrence during the whole observation time. A relining of the dentures was not necessary. The retention force was scored as to high (6 implants, upper jaw) and as to low (2 implants, lower jaw) at two patients each. After 3 years {{there is a lack of}} technical failures of the implants and an aftercare of the teeth abutments. The questionnaire shows a significant difference (Wilcoxon-test) between the old and the new denture according the patient's general satisfaction, the fit, the retention, the wearing comfort and the chewing comfort. No difference was detected at the hygiene ability. The relative manufacture time in the dental laboratory of a denture retained by 4 SynCone® abutments was reduced in average to 52. 82 % compared to the conventional customized, casted double crowns. Discussion The results of the recent prospective clinical study show that double crown based removable prosthesis retained on SynCone® abutments demonstrate a similar clinical performance to fixed implant retained prostheses: two weeks after insertion there are no more pressure spots occurrences, prostheses show no micro-movement, which is also confirmed by the patients, which describes the overdentures "as similar as the own dentition". Furthermore, the posterior extension of the denture base acts as cantilever of a fixed construction. The absence of complications related to implant component's overloading such as abutment loosening andlor fractures give a further evidence of an anchorage free of micro-movements. This type of rigid anchorage of implant retained overdentures can be achieved by using tapered connectioris (double crown principle) with high accuracy of fit after their integration (intraoral cementation) into a metal framework. As well the pre-fabricated components as the applied intraoral cementation provide the final construction with a remarkable passivity of fit and stability, which is predictable and easily reproducible. Moreover, with the prefabricated components almost the half of the dental technician's time needed for the manufacture can be saved and consequently a reduction of the manufacturing costs of the entire therapy can be achieved. However, a symmetrical topography of attachment's distribution is required. In case with two implants placed interforaminal the opposite jaw should only be provided with a full denture, in order to avoid an overload of the implants. Additionally, the results of this prospective clinical trial show that well-known results and clinical outcomes of the use of cone crowns such as integration of residual dentition, the easy hygiene and handling, the excellent wearing and chewing comfort as well the easy modification of the prostheses in cases of attachment losses, can be one-to-one transferred to the clinical outcomes we observed by using the SynCone attachment for implant retained overdentures. Conclusion The SynCone® system allows an efficient manufacturing of implant retained overdentures with an easy access of hygiene for the implants and an optimal accuracy of fit. Therefore, this type of denture achieves a high degree of quality in a simple, reproducible and cost effective manner simulating the involved tissues and the patient the advantages of a fixed bridge. However, some minor improvements of the prefabricated retainer are necessary to achieve a sufficient retention by using only two implants. Die demographische Entwicklung beeinflusst sowohl die Anzahl als auch den Typ von Patienten in Zahnarztpraxen: in naher Zukunft wird vor allem der Anteil von alten und sehr alten Patienten zunehmen, die aktiv um eine Verbesserung des aufgrund ihrer atrophierten Alveolarkämme insuffizienten Prothesenhalts nachfragen und hierzu neben ihrer Restbezahnung vor allem die Nutzung von Implantaten wünschen. Ziel Das Ziel dieser prospektiven klinischen Studie ist die Evaluation des Langzeitverhaltens von implantatgestützten Deckprothesen, die mit einem innovativen Konuskronensystems namens SynCone® (Dentsply, Friadent, Germany) verankert sind. Das Alleinstellungsmerkmal dieses Haltelements ist eine präfabrizierte Patrize und Matrize. Material und Methode An dieser Studie nahmen 23 Patienten (15 m, 83 w, ~ Alter: 61, 6 Jahre +- 12. 9 SD) teil. Nach 3 drop-outs konnten 21 Deckprothesen (9 Unterkiefer, 12 Oberkiefer, gestützt auf insgesamt 91 Ankylos®-lmplantaten und 6 Zähnen) während einer 36 -monatigen Funktionsperiode regelmäßig evaluiert werden. Die im Unterkiefer inserierten Implantate wurden nach einer dreimonatigen, die im Oberkiefer nach einer fünfmonatigen Einheilungszeit belastet. Die gemeinsame Einschubrichtung der konischen Patrizen ist einfach durch ein uneingeschränktes Drehen eines abgewinkelten Abutments (SynCone®-Abutmen) zu erzielen, das zum Implantat eine Index freie Verbindung aufweist. Die erforderliche, sichere Rotationsblockierung eines in Einschubrichtung ausgerichteten SynCone®-Abutments wird durch eine hohe Haftreibung erzielt, die beim Festschrauben des Abutments zwischen den Fügeflächen der internen Implantat-Abutment Konusverbindung entsteht. Die präfabrizierten Matrizen (SynCone®-Kappen) werden gleichzeitig und intraoral mit einem selbst härtenden Kunststoff in das Prothesengerüst aus CoCrMo eingeklebt. Folgende klinische Parameter wurden während der Nachuntersuchungen erhoben: Haftung, Passung und erforderlicher Nachsorgeaufwand der Deckprothesen; Osseointegration der Implantate (Periotest®) und der Zustand des periimplantären Weichgewebes (Periotron®). Zudem wurde von den Studienteilnehmern bei jedem Untersuchungstermin ein Fragebogen ausgefüllt. Die statistische Auswertung erfolgte mit der Software STATISTICA (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, USA). Ergebnisse Ein Implantat im Unterkiefer ging nach 25 Monaten verloren (Überlebensrate: 98, 91 %). Die Periotest®Werte verbesserten sich statistisch signifikant (Tukey test, pc 0. 05) zwischen dem Einsetzdatum der neuen Prothese und aller darauf folgenden Nachkontrollen. Das Weichgewebe verbesserte seinen Zustand anhand der Periotron® Werte signifikant zwischen dem Einsetzdatum und nach 36 Monaten (Tukey Test, p< 0. 05). Druckstellen traten während der 36 -monatigen Beobachtungszeit ausschließlich initial bei drei (3) Patienten auf, eine Unterfüttung war bei keinem Patienten erforderlich. Bei zwei (2) Patienten wurde eine zu hohe Haftkraft der Oberkieferprothese auf 6 lmplantaten festgestellt, bei zwei (2) Patienten war die Haftkraft der Unterkieferprothese auf 2 lmplantaten zu gering. Nach 3 Jahren traten weder technische Misserfolge bei den lmplantaten noch Folgebehandlungen der Pfeilerzähne auf. Die Auswertung der Fragebögen zeigte einen signifikanten Unterschied (Wilcoxon-Test) zwischen der alten und neuen Prothese bezüglich der allgemeinen Zufriedenheit, der Passgenauigkeit, der Haftkraft, des Trage- und des Kaukomforts. Die Hygienefähigkeit wurde nicht unterschiedlich bewertet. Die Herstellungszeit einer auf 4 SynCone® Abutments verankerten Prothese konnte in 12 befragten zahntechnischen Labors im Vergleich zu Prothesen mit individuell gefertigten, gegossenen Konuskronen auf durchschnittlich 52. 82 % reduziert werden. Diskussion Die Ergebnisse dieser prospektiven klinischen Studie zeigen, dass auf präfabrizierte Konuskronen des SynCone® Systems verankerte Deckprothesen eine vergleichbare Performance als festsitzender Zahnersatz aufweisen: es treten zwei Wochen nach Eingliederung keine Druckstellen mehr auf, die Prothesen sind frei von Mikrobewegungen, bestätigt durch die Patienten als „fester Zahnersatz". Zudem wirkt die posteriore Extension der Prothese über den Freiendsattel als weitspanniger Freiendpontik einer festsitzenden Konstruktion. Das Ausbleiben von technischen Implantatversagen augrund einer Überbelastung beweist zudem eine mikrobewegungsfreie Verankerung der Prothese. Diese Art der steifen, rein implantatgestützten Verankerung kann durch die Verwendung von Konusverbindungen (Doppelkronen-Prinzip) erzielt werden, deren Matrizen mit einem exakt passenden Metallgerüst verbunden sind. Die klinische Realisation eines passiv und stabil sitzenden Prothesengerüsts wird sowohl durch die präfabrizierten Komponenten als auch durch die angewandte intraorale Verklebungstechnik leicht reproduzierbar und damit vorhersagbar. Zusätzlich kann etwa die Hälfte der Arbeitszeit eines Zahntechnikers eingespart und dadurch eine erhebliche Reduktion der Therapiekosten erzielt werden. Jedoch ist eine symmetrische Topographie der lmplantate und gegebenenfalls der integrierten Pfeilerzähne erforderlich. Zwei interforaminal platzierte lmplantate sind nur bei einer Totalprothese im Oberkiefer indiziert, um eine Überbelastung der lmplantate zu vermeiden. Die Ergebnisse dieser prospektiven klinischen Studie zeigen außerdem, dass die bereits bekannten Vorteile von individuell gefertigten Konuskronen wie die Integration der Restbezahnung, die einfache Hygiene und Handhabung, der exzellente Trage- und Kaukomfort und die einfache Modifikation der Prothese im Falle eines Pfeilerverlustes, ohne Einschränkungen auf die klinischen Resultate von SynCone-verankerten Deckprothesen übertragen werden. Schlussfolgerung Das SynCone® System ermöglicht eine effiziente Herstellung von implantatverankerten Prothesen mit leichtem Hygiene-Zugang der lmplantate und mit einer optimalen Passgenauigkeit. Deshalb erzielt diese Art von herausnehmbarem Zahnersatz einen hohen, reproduzierbaren Grad an Qualität und bietet den beteiligten Gewebestrukturen und dem Patienten die Vorteile einer festsitzenden Brücke. Jedoch sind geringfügige Veränderungen an dem präfabrizierten Halteelement erforderlich um eine zufrieden stellende Retention auch bei nur zwei Implantaten zu erzielen...|$|E
