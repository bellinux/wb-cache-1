5|$|The pilot {{episode was}} written by South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker, and was {{directed}} by Parker; it was made on a budget of $300,000. Similarly to Parker and Stone's Christmas shorts, the original pilot was animated entirely with traditional cut paper stop motion animation techniques. This laborious process involved creating hundreds of construction paper <b>cutouts</b> – including individual mouth shapes, {{and many of the}} characters in several different sizes –, and photographing every frame of the show with an overhead camera, to the dialog that had been recorded earlier. Assistants helped with the cutting and pasting of the <b>cutouts,</b> while the animation was primarily done by Parker, Stone, and South Park animation director Eric Stough. The episode took between three and three and a half months to complete, and animation took place in a small room at Celluloid Studios, in Denver, Colorado, during the summer of 1996. Additional animation techniques involved creating the starry night sky by putting holes into a black posterboard and illuminating it from behind, and having the pooling of Kenny's blood simulated by drawing an initial dot with a red marker pen, and drawing more to it with every frame. The characters who are not speaking rarely move, saving time in the animation process.|$|E
5|$|When {{the show}} began using computers, the {{cardboard}} <b>cutouts</b> were scanned and re-drawn with CorelDRAW, then imported into PowerAnimator, {{which was used}} with SGI workstations to animate the characters. The workstations were linked to a 54-processor render farm that could render 10 to 15 shots an hour. Beginning with season five, the animators began using Maya instead of PowerAnimator. The studio now runs a 120-processor render farm that can produce 30 or more shots an hour.|$|E
5|$|An unnamed {{precursor}} to Kenny {{first appeared in}} the first The Spirit of Christmas short, dubbed Jesus vs. Frosty, created by Parker and Stone in 1992 while they were students at the University of Colorado. The character was composed of construction paper <b>cutouts</b> and animated through the use of stop motion. When tasked three years later by friend Brian Graden to create another short as a video Christmas card that he could send to friends, Parker and Stone created another similarly-animated The Spirit of Christmas short, dubbed Jesus vs. Santa. In this short, Kenny is given his first name, and first appears as he does in the series.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the effects of}} a <b>cutout</b> on the buckling and postbuckling behavior of rectangular plates made of advanced composite materials. An overview of past research is presented, and several key findings and behavioral characteristics are discussed. These findings include the effects of <b>cutout</b> size, shape, eccentricity, and orientation; plate aspect and slenderness ratios; loading and boundary conditions; and plate orthotropy and anisotropy. Some overall important findings of these studies are that plates that have a <b>cutout</b> can buckle at loads higher than the buckling loads for corresponding plates without a <b>cutout</b> and can exhibit substantial postbuckling load-carrying capability. In addition, laminate construction, coupled with <b>cutout</b> geometry, offers a viable means for tailoring structural response. 2 Table 1.

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} study of the {{performance}} of two forms of <b>cutout</b> and various edge reinforcements in a composite C-section beam under static shear load. Firstly, <b>cutout</b> shape effect on stress concentration was studied. This was followed by a comparative study of a range of reinforcement doublers, which were 20 mm wide rings made of a steel alloy or composite laminate, or by a novel fibre tow placement technique. The comparisons are made in terms of the stress and strain reductions at a hot spot at the <b>cutout</b> edge. Good agreement between the numerical and test results has been achieved for different <b>cutout</b> shapes and reinforcements, and this study has demonstrated that the <b>cutout</b> induced stress concentration can be reduced significantly by appropriate <b>cutout</b> shape and edge reinforcements. The stress reduction magnitude is found to be strongly related to the stiffness of the reinforcement rings. The diamond-shaped <b>cutout</b> and the fibre tows reinforcement show clear advantages over the widely adapted circular <b>cutout</b> and laminated ring reinforcement. These findings should contribute to future design improvement of composite aircraft structures in similar shape and loading conditions...|$|R

5|$|The {{characters}} and objects {{are composed of}} simple geometrical shapes and primary colors. Most child characters are {{the same size and}} shape, and are distinguished by their clothing, hair and skin colors, and headwear. Characters are mostly presented two-dimensionally and from only one angle. Their movements are animated in an intentionally jerky fashion, as they are purposely not offered the same free range of motion associated with hand-drawn characters. Occasionally, some non-fictional characters are depicted with photographic <b>cutouts</b> of their actual head and face in lieu of a face reminiscent of the show's traditional style. Canadians on the show are often portrayed in an even more minimalist fashion; they have simple beady eyes, and the top halves of their heads simply flap up and down when the characters speak.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} series of Torchwood, the Torchwood website, located at torchwood.org.uk, recounted some adventures by Captain Jack through an {{alternate}} reality game {{made up of}} electronic literature {{in the form of}} fictional intercepted blogs, newspaper <b>cutouts</b> and confidential letters and IM conversations between members of the Torchwood Three crew. Written by James Goss, the first series' website sheds some light on Jack's backstory in the years he worked for Torchwood. For the second series in 2008, a second interactive Torchwood online game was devised, scripted by series writer Phil Ford, and as with the 2006 website contained some information on Jack's unseen adventures. The BBC America Torchwood also has a 'Captain's Blog' section which relays Jack's accounts of the events of each episode. The Torchwood Archives by Gary Russell collects much of this online literature for the first two series in hardback form, including the Captain's Blog section of the BBC America website.|$|E
5|$|The characters' {{body and}} facial {{movements}} were recorded using motion capture: these included capturing static figures for dialogue segments, and full-body capture for action sequences. The motion actors provided {{the basis for}} their characters' appearance: the actors were chosen based on how well they fitted with the staff's vision for the characters. The motion actors' facial expressions were captured using a special head-mounted rig the team had previously developed for the 2012 tech demo. When the character designs were being created, Nozue needed to regularly consult professional hairstylists to ensure that their chosen hairstyles for characters would be feasible in real life. For characters who appeared in the game, the team tried to keep their facial features {{as close as possible to}} their in-game counterpart. As with other Japanese CGI films aiming for a realistic tone, the team relied on photogrammetry and an extensive 3D scanning process combined with motion capture. Character clothing was created in a similar way to real-life clothing, with a number of different design variations being tested using paper <b>cutouts.</b> Something that both in-house and external staff contended with was making character movements realistic without being symmetrical; the biggest example was Libertus's need to walk on crutches for much of the movie, shifting his weight balance and movement speed.|$|E
40|$|The postbuckling {{behavior}} of square compression-loaded graphite-epoxy plates and isotropic plates {{with a central}} circular <b>cutout</b> is studied. The {{results suggest that the}} change in the plate's axial stiffness is strongly dependent on <b>cutout</b> size and plate orthotropy. It is found that the <b>cutout</b> size and stacking sequence of a composite plate may be tailored to optimize postbuckling stiffness. Also, it is suggested that a <b>cutout</b> may influence model interaction in a plate. The effects of load-path eccentricity on buckling behavior are examined...|$|R

The effects of reinforcement size, thickness, and orthotropy on the overall response of compression-loaded shells are described. In general, reinforcement around a <b>cutout</b> in a compression-loaded shell can retard or eliminate the local buckling response and material failure near the <b>cutout</b> and increase the buckling load of the shell. However, some results show that certain reinforcement configurations can cause {{a significant increase in}} the local interlaminar failures that can accumulate near the free edges of a <b>cutout</b> during a local buckling event...|$|R

40|$|Background: Following {{internal}} fixation of intertrochanteric hip fractures, tip apex distance, fracture classification, {{position of}} the screw in the femoral head, and fracture reduction are known predictors for screw <b>cutout,</b> but {{the reliability of the}}se measurements is unknown. We investigated the reliability of the tip apex distance measurement, the Cleveland femoral head dividing system, the three-grade classification system of Baumgaertner for fracture reduction, and the AO classification system as predictors for screw <b>cutout.</b> Methods: All patients with an intertrochanteric hip fracture who were managed with either a dynamic hip screw or a gamma nail between January 2007 and June 2010 were evaluated from our hip trauma database. Results: The tip apex distance measurement was reliable and patients with device <b>cutout</b> had a significantly higher tip apex distance. The agreement between observers with regard to screw position and fracture reduction was moderately reliable. After adjustment for tip apex distance and screw position, A 3 fractures were at more risk of <b>cutout</b> compared with A 1 fractures. Poor fracture reduction was significantly related with a higher incidence of <b>cutout</b> in univariate analysis, but not in multivariate analysis. Central-inferior and anterior-inferior positions, after adjustment for tip apex distance and screw position, were significantly protective against <b>cutout.</b> Conclusion: To decrease probable risks of <b>cutout,</b> the tip apex distance needs to stay small or the screw needs to be placed central-inferiorly or anterior-inferiorly.
