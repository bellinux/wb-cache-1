40|$|It {{was known}} that {{application}} of glycine betaine (GB) to plants could improve tolerance to stress caused by chilling, frost, salt, drought and high light intensities, {{and that this}} effect was accompanied by gene expression changes, but whether the gene expression changes were implicated in GB's effect and which genes were involved has been unclear. In the fourth issue of Physiologia Plantarum, we identified genes upregulated by GB {{that are involved in}} reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism and membrane trafficking processes. Direct evidence was provided for a role for a membrane trafficking protein (RabA 4 c) in GB's effect on ROS accumulation during chilling. In this Addendum, we discuss our findings that chilling stress is so closely linked with ROS accumulation. Chilling elevates ROS levels and results in inhibited root growth upon transfer of plants back to normal growing conditions. During the 2 â 4 day recovery period, ROS levels decline in root tips and in leaves. If ROS accumulation in response to <b>chilling</b> is <b>blocked</b> by pretreatment with GB, optimal root growth begins as soon as plants are transferred back to normal growing conditions without a recovery period, suggesting that chilling stress involves a ROS signaling pathway...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT We {{applied the}} {{quick-freezing}} technique {{to investigate the}} precise temporal coincidence between the onset of quantal secretion {{and the appearance of}} fusions of synaptic vesicles with the prejunctional membrane. Frog cutaneous pectoris nerve-muscle preparations were soaked in modified Ringer's solution with 1 mM 4 -aminopyridine, 10 mM Ca 2 +, and 10 - 4 M d-Tubocurarine and quick-frozen 1 - 10 ms after a single supramaximal shock. The frozen muscles were then either freeze-fractured or cryosubstituted in acetone with 13 % OsO 4 and processed for thin section electron microscopy. Temporal resolution of < 1 ms can be achieved using a quick-freeze device that increases the rate of freezing of the muscle after it strikes the <b>chilled</b> copper <b>block</b> (15 Â°K) and that minimizes the precooling of the muscle during its descent toward the block. We minimized variations in transmission time by examining thin sections taken only from the medial edge of the muscle, which was at a fixed distance from the point of stimulation of the nerve.

The melt spun ribbons were consolidated and hot rolled to sheet {{to produce a}} supersaturated Cu-Cr-Nb solid solution from which the high melting point intermetallic compound Cr 2 Nb could be precipitated to strengthen the Cu matrix. The {{results show that the}} materials possess electrical conductivities in excess of 90 percent that of pure Cu at 200 C and above. The strengths of the Cu-Cr-Nb alloys were much greater than Cu, Cu- 0. 6 Cr, NARloy-A, and NARloy-Z in the as-melt spun condition. The strengths of the consolidated materials were less than Cu-Cr and Cu-Cr-Zr below 500 C and 600 C respectively, but were significantly better above these temperatures. The strengths of the consolidated materials were greater than NARloy-Z, at all temperatures. The GLIDCOP possessed similar strength levels up to 750 C when the strength of the Cu-Cr-Nb alloys begins to degrade. The long term stability of the Cu-Cr-Nb alloys was measured by the microhardness of aged samples and the growth of precipitates. The microhardness measurements indicate that the alloys overage rapidly, but do not suffer much loss in strength between 10 and 100 hours which confirms the results of the electrical resistivity measurements taken during the aging of the alloys at 500 C. The loss in strength from peak strength levels is significant, but the strength remains exceptionally good. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the as-melt spun samples revealed that Cr 2 Nb precipitates formed in the liquid Cu during the <b>chill</b> <b>block</b> melt spinning, indicating a very strong driving force for the formation of the precipitates.

40|$|Mg 17 Al 12 {{compound}} is a hardening {{phase in}} AZ 91 D alloy. Moreover, {{the concentration of}} Al and Zn {{has been found to}} be closely related to the corrosion performance of the magnesium alloy. The aim of this work was to study the effect of cooling rate on distribution Of Mg 17 Al 12 compound and compositional inhomogeneity in an AZ 91 D magnesium sand-cast plate (200 x 140 x 20 mm(3)). A copper <b>chill</b> <b>block,</b> which was placed at the end of mold cavity, was used to increase the cooling rate during solidification. A sand-cast plate was also produced, where no <b>chill</b> <b>block</b> being mounted at the end of mold cavity. The "with chill block" plate showed a rapid increasing in cooling rate with respect to distance from riser, as compared to the "without chill block" plate where almost no cooling rate fluctuation occurred. The volume fraction of Mg 17 Al 12 (beta phase) in the "without chill block" plate was higher than that in "with chill block" plate. In the "without chill block" plate, volume fraction of Mg 17 Al 12 was about 13. 9 vol% (near the riser) to about 19. 3 vol% (close to the end of the plate). However, the "with chill block'' plate was solidified in a higher cooling rate, leading to low volume fraction of the beta phase (13. 4 vol%). Higher cooling rate also resulted in more severe compositional inhomogeneity in the sand-cast plate. The Al and Zn concentration in the "with chill block" plate showed a concave downward dependence against the distance to riser. Moreover, in the "with chill block" plate, concentrations of Al and Zn did not enrich at the position near chill face. Instead, the Al and Zn contents near the chill surface were well below the average value. This finding is in disagreement with previou...|$|E
40|$|Much of the {{material}} science gained in microgravity research requires processing a sample in a high performance furnace. One such furnace currently being designed is the Quench Module Insert (QMI). The Principle Investigators, for whom the furnace is proposed, require high temperature gradients in their cylindrical samples to achieve the science objectives. One of the components critical to achieving high sample axial temperature gradients in the Quench Module Insert is a high performance cold zone to extract {{the heat from the}} sample. This cold zone employs a compliant, sliding thermal interface based on a Vel-Therm felt. This felt provides a conductive path between the Sample Cartridge Assembly (SCA) exterior surface and the interior surface of the water cooled <b>chill</b> <b>block</b> while allowing movement of the sample relative to the <b>chill</b> <b>block.</b> The Vel-Therm felt is composed of long polymer-based fibers affixed to a thin flexible substrate layer. The fibers are oriented perpendicular to this substrate giving the felt the appearance of a velvet fabric. The Vel-Therm felt heat extraction capability was quantified in earlier tests performed in an inert gas environment. The current activity, described in this paper, is intended to characterize the extraction capability of Vel-Therm felt in a vacuum environment similar to the QMI environment. This testing is necessary to quantify the thermal performance of the Vel-Therm felt and the sensitivity of that performance to key variables. The data derived from these tests will be incorporated into the current thermal models {{to improve the quality of}} the models and reduce uncertainty of the analytical results. In addition, the data will be used to help select the appropriate Vel-Therm felt and set proper operating limits as well as assess the performance range of the furnace. The objective of this test is to measure the heat extraction rate of the Vel-Therm felt as specified by the effective heat transfer coefficient. Therefore, the test setup was designed to force the bulk of the heat transfer through the area where the Vel-Therm felt was applied. A heat source, consisting of a ceramic heating element encased in a Copper (Cu) housing is mounted on four isolated support rods. A 6 -layer molybdenum radiation shield is used to insulate against heat loss from the heater and prevent heat exchange between the hot and cold sides of the test apparatus. The Vel-Therm felt is affixed to the surface of the cold sink, a water-cooled Cu <b>chill</b> <b>block.</b> An adjustable plate supports and isolates the cold sink from above and is used to control the amount of the deflection of the Vel- Therm when in contact with the Cu heating element housing. The primary means of establishing the power being conducted through the felt is to measure the energy being transferred to the water passing through the <b>chill</b> <b>block.</b> Analysis was performed to support the assumption that the source and sink surfaces were approximately isothermal under the specific test conditions. As a check on the amount of power passing through the felt, the power supplied to the heater was also measured. Thermocouples were strategically located throughout the test apparatus for measurement purposes. A bell jar was lowered over the assembly to impose vacuum conditions. Currently, variables tested have been fiber compression and fiber type and surface temperatures (both the hot and cold side temperatures are hypothesized to be important to the performance of the Vel-Therm.) Selected runs were repeated to ensure consistency and repeatability. Results obtained thus far reveal that Vel-Therm performance is significantly degraded by fibers being exposed to high compression. It also shows that performance is somewhat negatively impacted by previous compression, thereby, raising the question of repeatability. In addition, early results show a significant dependence on temperature. A computer aided mathematical analysis of the test setup is ongoing. The results will be correlated to actual results. The correlation will examine such details as parasitic loses, conduction down the power leads and many other concerns...|$|E

The frozen muscles were then either freeze- fractured or cryosubstituted in acetone with 13 % OsO 4 and processed for thin section electron microscopy. Temporal resolution of less than 1 ms can be achieved using a quick-freeze device that increases the rate of freezing of the muscle after it strikes the <b>chilled</b> copper <b>block</b> (15 degrees K) and that minimizes the precooling of the muscle during its descent toward the block. We minimized variations in transmission time by examining thin sections taken only from the medial edge of the muscle, which was at a fixed distance from the point of stimulation of the nerve. The ultrastructure of the cryosubstituted preparations was well preserved to a depth of 5 - 10 micron, and within this narrow band vesicles were found fused with the axolemma after a minimum delay of 2. 5 ms after stimulation of the nerve. Since the total transmission time to this edge of the muscle was approximately 3 ms, these results indicate that the vesicles fuse with the axolemma precisely {{at the same time the}} quanta are released. Freeze-fracture does not seem to be an adequate experimental technique for this work because in the well- preserved band of the muscle the fracture plane crosses, but does not cleave, the inner hydrophobic domain of the plasmalemma.

Direct isochronally PA 17 - 7 PH steel ribbons showed a precipitation of M(23) C(16) predominantly at grain boundaries with a plate like morphology (plates 140 to 300 nm long and 70 to 140 nm wide) ...|$|E
