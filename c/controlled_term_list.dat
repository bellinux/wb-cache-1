40|$|A {{personalized}} video summary is dynamically {{generated in}} our video personalization and summarization {{system based on}} user preference and usage environment. The three-tier personalization system adopts the server-middleware-client architecture in order to maintain, select, adapt, and deliver rich media content to the user. The server stores the content sources along with their corresponding MPEG- 7 metadata descriptions. In this paper, the metadata includes visual semantic annotations and automatic speech transcriptions. Our personalization and summarization engine in the middleware selects the optimal set of desired video segments by matching shot annotations and sentence transcripts with user preferences. Besides finding the desired contents, {{the objective is to}} present a coherent summary. There are diverse methods for creating summaries, and we focus on the challenges of generating a hierarchical video summary based on context information. In our summarization algorithm, three inputs are used to generate the hierarchical video summary output. These inputs are (1) MPEG- 7 metadata descriptions of the contents in the server, (2) user preference and usage environment declarations from the user client, and (3) context information including MPEG- 7 <b>controlled</b> <b>term</b> <b>list</b> and classification scheme. In a video sequence, descriptions and relevance scores are assigned to each shot. Based on these shot descriptions, context clustering is performed to collect consecutively similar shots to correspond to hierarchical scene representations. The context clustering is based on the available context information, and may be derived from domain knowledge or rules engines. Finally, the selection of structured video segments to generate the hierarchical summary efficiently balances between scene representation and shot selection...|$|E
40|$|This study {{set out to}} see how {{controlled}} vocabularies {{help people}} find collections materials in electronic museum databases. It did this by interviewing collections staff from four museums. Eight people from library and non-library work areas at the four museums, who regularly search a museum database {{in the course of}} their work, were asked about their experiences with using controlled vocabularies to search. How people used <b>controlled</b> <b>terms</b> depended upon their job tasks and upon their knowledge of terms, past experience and training, and whether they trusted that terms would deliver good search results. Difficulties in using them were identified as being to do with terms themselves; the knowledge of the person searching; and the quality of information in the database. Despite <b>controlled</b> <b>terms</b> rarely being used alone for searching, respondents considered that controlled terminologies are important tools within museum databases for accessing collections. <b>Controlled</b> <b>terms</b> are resource intensive and need institutional backing to work well. Peer support, formal training, staff with database and <b>controlled</b> <b>terms</b> experience, and access to <b>terms</b> <b>lists</b> are some specific factors that would assist controlled vocabularies to work better for the people who search museum databases. Museums need to allocate sufficient financial and administrative resources to <b>controlled</b> <b>terms,</b> if they are serious about improving access to their collections...|$|R

40|$|Bilingual <b>term</b> <b>lists</b> are {{extensively}} used as {{a resource}} for dictionary-based Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR), in which the goal is to find documents written in one natural language based on queries that are expressed in another. This paper identifies eight types of terms that affect retrieval effectiveness in CLIR applications through their coverage by general-purpose bilingual <b>term</b> <b>lists,</b> and reports results from an experimental evaluation of the coverage of 35 bilingual <b>term</b> <b>lists</b> in news retrieval application. Retrieval effectiveness was found to be strongly influenced by <b>term</b> <b>list</b> size for lists that contain between 3, 000 and 30, 000 unique terms per language. Supplemental techniques for named entity translation were found to be useful with even the largest lexicons. The contribution of named entity translation was evaluated in a cross-language experiment involving English and Chinese. Smaller effects were observed from deficiencies in the coverage of domainspecific terminology when searching news stories. UMIACS-TR- 2003 - 22 LAMP-TR- 09...|$|R

30|$|The current STD {{evaluation}} {{focused on}} searching a training/development <b>term</b> <b>list</b> in training/development speech data and searching a test <b>term</b> <b>list</b> in test speech data. In future evaluations, the cross-data term search should be also considered. To do so, organizers should provide the alignments of the training/development {{terms in the}} test speech data and the alignments of the test terms in the training/development speech data. The purpose of this cross-data search is to see how critical tuning is for the different systems. For example, searching test terms in training/development speech data could be enhanced by unsupervised adaptation, whereas searching training/development terms in test speech data will measure the generalization capability of the systems on unseen data with the same <b>term</b> <b>list</b> for which good classifiers could have been developed.|$|R
40|$|Content-based {{full-text search}} still remains a {{particularly}} challenging problem in peer-to-peer (P 2 P) systems. Traditionally, {{there have been}} two index partitioning structures [...] -partitioning based on the document space or partitioning based on keywords. The former requires search of every node in the system to answer a query whereas the latter transmits a large amount of data when processing multi-term queries. In this paper, we propose eSearch [...] -a P 2 P keyword search system based on a novel hybrid indexing structure. In eSearch, each node is responsible for certain terms. Given a document, eSearch uses a modern information retrieval algorithm to select a small number of top (important) terms in the document and publishes the complete <b>term</b> <b>list</b> for the document to nodes responsible for those top terms. This selective replication of <b>term</b> <b>lists</b> allows a multi-term query to proceed local to the nodes responsible for query terms. We also propose automatic query expansion to alleviate the degradation of quality of search results due to the selective replication, overlay source multicast to reduce the cost of disseminating <b>term</b> <b>lists,</b> and techniques to balance <b>term</b> <b>list</b> distribution across nodes...|$|R

40|$|Combining {{adaptive}} fuzzy sliding mode {{control with}} fuzzy or variable universe fuzzy switching technique, this study develops two novel direct adaptive schemes for a class of MIMO nonlinear systems with uncertainties and external disturbances. The proposed control schemes consist of fuzzy equivalent <b>control</b> <b>terms,</b> fuzzy switching <b>control</b> <b>terms</b> (in scheme one) or variable universe fuzzy switching <b>control</b> <b>terms</b> (in scheme two), and compensation <b>control</b> <b>terms.</b> The compensation <b>control</b> <b>terms</b> are used to relax the assumption on fuzzy approximation error.

In this paper, we present a system used in this task and evaluate the term recognition results of this system. We believe that terms could be words that characterize the field's data and have the following three features: (1) They frequently appear in the target field's corpus. (2) They are not common terms in the target field. (3) They less frequently appear in the other fields' corpora. Our system uses different field corpora and recognizes these features as terms. We extracted a <b>term</b> <b>list</b> by using two kinds of field corpora, the NACSIS Academic Conference Database and the MAINICHI newspaper database.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a series of}} experiments involving expansion of a domain-specific human-generated "seed list" using available linguistic resources. The resources used for the expansion are intended to be general purpose: two large-scale Chinese-English dictionaries and a Chinese lexical knowledge base (HowNet). The methodology involves three steps: (1) hand extraction of head words from each entry in the human-generated seed list; (2) automatic comparison of these head words against entries in the linguistic resources-where an entry matches if the head word matches the entry exactly or is included in its the semantic definition; and (3) collection of any resulting matching entries into a larger <b>term</b> <b>list.</b> The <b>terms</b> extracted by this process were verified manually to confirm whether they were relevant {{to the topic of}} a specific domain.
