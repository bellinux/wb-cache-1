Roughly 9% of the known protein structures have been obtained by nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. The secondary structure composition can be determined via circular dichroism.

Two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy has become a valuable method to investigate the structures of flexible peptides and proteins that cannot be studied with other methods. Cryo-electron microscopy has recently become a means of determining protein structures to high resolution, less than 5 ångströms or 0.5 nanometer, and is anticipated to increase in power as a tool for high resolution work in the next decade. This technique is still a valuable resource for researchers working with very large protein complexes such as virus coat proteins and amyloid fibers. A more qualitative picture of protein structure is often obtained by proteolysis, which is also useful to screen for more crystallizable protein samples. Novel implementations of this approach, including fast parallel proteolysis (FASTpp), can probe the structured fraction and its stability without the need for purification.|$|E

Strong modification of structural and electrical behavior for area exposed to ion irradiation is observed when the film is etched in the <b>crystallized</b> <b>state.</b> Both the implantation of Ga+ ions and the film amorphization highlighted by Raman spectroscopy and Kelvin force microscopy analyses can explain this result. The piezoactivity detected by piezoresponse force microscopy is fully destroyed even after a post-annealing treatment. In the case of amorphous etched film, no significant degradation is observed. The latter process is used to successfully fabricate Pb(ZrxTi 1 -x) O 3 -based nanocapacitors by means of FIB method. In 50 -nm-size capacitors, the local electromechanical behavior is measured at similar level that the one obtained for the un-etched film, evidencing no manifest sidewall effect or FIB-induced damages.

Recent advances have established techniques for ensuring completeness conditions (low-order polynomials are interpolated exactly) are enforced when estimating property gradients, but the consequences on errors have not been investigated. Here, we present an expression for the error in an SPH estimate, accounting for completeness, an expression that applies to SPH generally. We revisit the derivation of the SPH equations for fluids, paying particular attention to the conservation principles. We find that a common method for enforcing completeness violates a property required of the kernel gradients, namely that gradients with respect the two position variables be equal and opposite. In such models this means conservation principles are not enforced and we present results that show this. As an aside we show the summation interpolant for density is a solution of, and may be used in the place of, the discretized, symmetrized continuity equation.

The mixture shows two widely separated relaxation processes, as before, with the faster relaxation due to the orientational diffusion of isoamylbromide and the slower due to that of 1 -propanol. In the mixture, the scaled contribution to permittivity from orientation polarization, ??, of isoamylbromide {{is about the same}} as in the pure state, but that of 1 -propanol decreases by a factor of 3 at 120 K. As the temperature is decreased, this difference remains constant. The relaxation time, ?, of isoamylbromide and its distribution parameter remains the same as for the pure liquid, but that of 1 -propanol is longer and increases with decrease in T, becoming 130 times the pure liquid 2 ̆ 7 s value at 119 K. This is in contrast to the finding for an isomeric heptanol, whose ? had decreased. Extrapolation suggests that at T> 151 K, ? of 1 -propanol in the mixture may become less than that in the pure liquid (the isoamylbromide component crystallizes before this temperature could be reached). This indicates that Tg corresponding to ? of 103 s for 1 -propanol in the mixture would be higher than in the pure liquid. Crystallization of the two components in the mixture occurs at different rates and 1 -propanol remains partially uncrystallized while isoamylbromide completely crystallizes. ? of any remaining liquid isoamylbromide does not change in the presence of <b>crystallized</b> <b>states</b> while ? of residual liquid 1 -propanol in the mixture is reduced.
