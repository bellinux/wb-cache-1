The first scenario focuses on the liberalization of the movement of people by removing quotas for independent <b>services</b> <b>suppliers,</b> for <b>contractual</b> <b>services</b> <b>suppliers</b> and for intra-corporate transferees, as well as labor market tests for intra-corporate transferees. The second scenario assumes all changes made in the first scenario as well as additional sector-specific liberalizations. In legal services and accounting services, the provision that foreign providers have to completely re-do the university degree, practice, and exam in the domestic country is reversed. Further, in telecommunications, courier services, and commercial banking, the government’s control over one major firm in the sector is suspended. Moreover, in computer services and air transport, the limitation on stays for independent <b>services</b> <b>suppliers,</b> for <b>contractual</b> <b>services</b> <b>suppliers,</b> and for intra-corporate transferees is increased from 12  months to more than 36  months. 14 [...]...|$|R

40|$|Background: In 2012, a pilot {{health policy}} of <b>contractual</b> <b>service</b> {{relations}} between general practitioners and patients was implemented in China. Due {{to the decline}} in body and cognitive function, {{as well as the}} lack of family care and narrow social support networks, the demand of health services among the elderly is much higher than that among the general population. This study aims to probe into the empty nesters’ willingness-to-pay for general practitioners using a <b>contractual</b> <b>service</b> policy, investigating empty nesters’ payment levels for the service, and analyze the main factors affecting the willingness of empty-nesters’ general practitioners using <b>contractual</b> <b>service</b> supply cost. Methods: This cross-sectional study adopted a multistage stratified sampling method to survey 865, city empty nesters (six communities in three districts of one city) aged 60 – 85 years. A condition value method was used to infer the distribution of the willingness-to-pay; Cox’s proportional hazards regression model was used to analyze the influencing factors of willingness-to-pay. Results: More than seventy percent (76. 6 %) of the empty nesters in this city were willing to pay general practitioners using contract service in Chongqing. The level of willingness-to-pay for the surveyed empty nesters was 34. 1 yuan per year. The median value was 22. 1 yuan per year, which was below the Chongqing urban and rural cooperative medical insurance individual funding level (60 yuan per year) in 2013. Cox’s proportional hazards regression model analysis showed that the higher the education level was, the worse the self-reported health status would be, accompanied by higher family per capita income, higher satisfaction of community health service, and higher willingness-to-pay empty nesters using a contract service. Women had a higher willingness-to-pay than men. Conclusions: The willingness-to-pay for general practitioners by <b>contractual</b> <b>service</b> is high among city empty nesters in Chongqing, thus, individual financing is feasible. However, people are willing to pay {{less than half of the}} current personal financing of cooperative medical insurance of urban and rural residents. Education level, family per capita income, and self-reported health status are the main factors affecting the cost sharing intention for general practitioners using contract service supply. According to the existing situation of different empty nesters, it is important to perfect the design of general practitioners using a <b>contractual</b> <b>service</b> policy system, according to differentiated personal financing levels...|$|R

The performance of the contact <b>services</b> <b>supplier</b> directly affects end customer satisfaction which underlines the need for appropriate management of customer contacts and consideration of the end customer's perspective in designing appropriate key performance indicators (KPIs). This research draws on various streams of literature including services purchasing, performance management and service quality to derive propositions on how to manage customer contact <b>services</b> <b>suppliers.</b> These propositions are subsequently investigated in an in-depth case study. The results of the case study show that managing customer contact <b>services</b> <b>suppliers</b> on effectiveness rather than efficiency benefits the overall performance of the supplier. This research shows that quality improvements in both process and service delivery ultimately lead to decreased costs. These improvements will furthermore enhance customer satisfaction and improve buying company performance.

However, the entire value differentiation theme could result in a high implementation quality. To trade off the revenue against the implementation complexity; we tend to any study the partial value differentiation theme and style a polynomial-time formula which will cipher the best partial differentiation costs.
