40|$|The SSRMS Module 1 {{software}} {{is part of}} a system for monitoring an adaptive, closed-loop control of the motions of a robotic arm in NASA s Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, where buoyancy in a pool of water is used to simulate the weightlessness of outer space. This {{software is}} so named because the robot arm is a replica of the Space Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS). This software is distributed, running on remote joint processors (RJPs), each of which is mounted in a hydraulic actuator comprising the joint of the robotic arm and communicating with a poolside processor denoted the Direct <b>Control</b> <b>Rack</b> (DCR). Each RJP executes the feedback joint-motion control algorithm for its joint and communicates with the DCR. The DCR receives joint-angular-velocity commands either locally from an operator or remotely from computers that simulate the flight like SSRMS and perform coordinated motion calculations based on hand-controller inputs. The received commands are checked for validity before they are transmitted to the RJPs. The DCR software generates a display of the statuses of the RJPs for the DCR operator and can shut down the hydraulic pump when excessive joint-angle error or failure of a RJP is detected...|$|E
40|$|Often called 'the {{heart of}} the engine', the fuel {{injection}} system is without any doubt {{one of the most}} important systems. It meters the fuel delivery according to engine requirements, it generates the high injection pressure required for fuel atomization, for air-fuel mixing and for combustion and it contributes to the fuel distribution in the combustion system-hence it significantly affects engine performance emissions and noise.

40|$|Pool {{oscillations}} in tungsten {{inert gas}} welding pools have been used in a closed- loop control system for orbital welding of ultra high purity tubing, determining a target level of penetration by altering the welding current in real-time. The technique is ideally suited to this application since it is does not contravene the cleanliness requirements for the inner bore and can be implemented outside the small orbital heads that are commonly used. The results presented in this thesis show how clear pool oscillation signals in extremely small molten pools can be monitored by optimising the welding conditions and signal processing of the arc voltage signal. As an indicator of the likely variation in cast behaviour present particularly in austenitic stainless steels, a 'time-to-penetrate' characterisation was made of the materials, using the time of the transition from the Mode 1 to the Mode 3 oscillation behaviour as the measured variable. By applying the test across a range of welding currents, significant insight was obtained into the cast and associated penetration behaviour. Late transitions indicated casts that exhibited significantly different responses to the more usually applied welding procedures, especially at the lower levels of welding current (highlighting their potentially more problematic penetration behaviour). It was shown that the established theoretical models were difficult to apply with certainty to moving weld pools, and consequently a fuzzy logic model was used in the control strategy. The closed-loop system comprised a user-interface PC, a <b>control</b> <b>rack</b> and commercial welding power source - control signals were applied every 2 to 3 Hz. Mode 3 pool oscillations were found to offer a more than satisfactory sensitivity to the inner bead width created for the various casts of 1. 65 mm wall thickness materials studied...|$|E

40|$|Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) {{activity}} {{is controlled by}} growth factors and adhesion signals in tumor cells. The scaffolding protein RACK 1 (receptor for activated C kinases) integrates insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and integrin signaling, but whether RACK 1 is required for FAK function is unknown. Here we show that association of FAK with RACK 1 is required for both FAK phos pho ryl a tion and dephos pho ryl a tion in response to IGF-I. Suppression of RACK 1 by small interfering RNA ablates FAK phos pho ryl a tion and reduces cell adhesion, cell spreading, and clonogenic growth. Peptide array and mutagenesis studies localize the FAK binding interface to blades I-III of the RACK 1 β-propeller and specifically identify a set of basic and hydrophobic amino acids (Arg- 47, Tyr- 52, Arg- 57, Arg- 60, Phe- 65, Lys- 127, and Lys- 130) as key determinants for association with FAK. Mutation of tyrosine 52 alone is sufficient to disrupt interaction of RACK 1 with FAK in cells where endogenous RACK 1 is suppressed by small interfering RNA. Cells expressing a Y 52 F mutant RACK 1 are impaired in adhesion, growth, and foci formation. Comparative analyses of homology models and crystal structures for RACK 1 orthologues suggest a role for Tyr- 52 as a site for phos pho ryl a tion that induces conformational change in RACK 1, switching the protein into a FAK binding state. Tyrosine 52 is further shown to be phos pho ryl a ted by c-Abl kinase, and the c-Abl inhibitor STI 571 disrupts FAK interaction with RACK 1. We conclude that FAK association with RACK 1 is regulated by phos pho ryl a tion of Tyr- 52. Our data reveal a novel mechanism whereby IGF-I and c-Abl <b>control</b> <b>RACK</b> 1 association with FAK to facilitate adhesion signaling...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{is a report}} and manual on the work done by the author in the control system of a High Voltage Laboratory in the Corporate Research Center of ABB in Baden-Dättwil, Switzerland. The project consisted in implementing the possibility to run automatic test sequences in the Lab, which was before just controlled manually through a Console. To do so, the author had to first think and implement a communication system between all the components in the Lab (the {{old and the new}} ones); to then program the Controller running the Lab and a Touch Panel so the future users could configure the test sequences easily from a convenient interface. Regarding the document itself, first of all there is an introduction to the kind of experiments carried out in the Lab, like Lightning or Switching Impulse tests. Following, there is an overview and general explanation of the Lab: its whole functionality, how it is structured and the communication between the different parts, and possible circuits to build and ways to operate it. There is also a description of all the components in the Laboratory, explaining their main characteristics, how they work and what they are used for. The main part of the thesis, however, is the detailed documentation of the codes programmed for the Controller and the Touch Panel, and the manual on how to operate the control system of the Lab. These parts want to be useful for people carrying experiments in the Lab, so they should be understandable for not initiated people; but also for future updates of it, as an structured base for more automated sequences to be added and more functionalities to be implemented as soon as they are needed. Finally, there is a brief chapter dedicated to some little works done for improving parts of the Lab, like the implementation of a cooling system in the <b>Control</b> <b>Rack</b> of the Lab, or the study {{of the effects of the}} atmospheric conditions in some experiments carried out in the Laboratory...|$|E
