5000|$|Horween Leather Company {{produces}} {{many different}} full <b>grain</b> and <b>corrected</b> <b>grain</b> <b>leathers.</b> Its leather {{is used in}} a number of products including footwear, sports equipment, bags, belts, wallets, briefcases, suitcases, jackets, coats, and other apparel and accessories. [...] As of 2003, 60% of the company's leather was used to make clothes, shoes, and accessories, and 40% for sporting goods such as footballs, basketballs, and baseball gloves.|$|R
5000|$|Corrected-grain leather is any leather {{that has}} had an {{artificial}} grain applied to its surface. The hides used to create corrected leather {{do not meet the}} standards for use in creating vegetable-tanned or aniline leather. The imperfections are corrected or sanded off, and an artificial grain embossed into the surface and dressed with stain or dyes. Most corrected-grain leather is used to make pigmented leather as the solid pigment helps hide the corrections or imperfections. <b>Corrected</b> <b>grain</b> <b>leathers</b> can mainly be bought as two finish types: semi-aniline and pigmented.|$|R
40|$|The shoes {{manufacturing}} {{implies the}} use of various types of leathers, leather substitutes and fabric. The sewing plays {{a very important role}} in shoe making, having an impact both in terms of functionality and outlook. One of the most important indicators of the sewed products quality is seam strength, which is influenced by a series of technological parameters such as: the shape of the needle’s top, the needle’s diameter, the seam thickness, the number of seams, the gauge of the thread, the type of seam and the material type. This paper studies the stitching strength of the full <b>grain</b> <b>leather</b> and full <b>grain</b> <b>leather</b> shiny surface used for footwear uppers, in order to improve productivity and seam quality. The experimental researches obtained for the stitching strength allow calculating the weakening coefficient of the material in the process of sewing (a= 0. 33 - 0. 48). The “a” coefficient is dependent on the stitch density, the shape of the needle’s top and the joined materials. In terms of stitching strength, the results indicate that the full <b>grain</b> <b>leather</b> obtains higher values than the full <b>grain</b> <b>leather</b> shiny surface. ...|$|R
50|$|In North America, the EX was the highest-level {{body style}} with {{amenities}} such as {{interior and exterior}} chrome accents, interior wood <b>grain,</b> <b>leather</b> wrapped steering wheel and gear shift knob and alloy wheels, with optional leather appointed seating, sunroof, and DVD player.|$|R
50|$|Among {{the main}} {{economic}} activities, a primary industry was salt mining from brine {{at a site}} between Caralis and Quartu, still undertaken today. This salt as well as <b>grain,</b> <b>leather</b> (tanned in establishments found near the port) and other products made in Sardinia were exported to other provinces of the empire.|$|R
5000|$|A second {{criticism}} {{is that the}} suede boots are too easily damaged and impossible to clean if {{they are exposed to}} grease, oil, or other petroleum products. In 2011, a new [...] "Maintainer" [...] style of boot, made with sage green full <b>grain</b> <b>leather,</b> was authorized for wear by all airmen to address these concerns.|$|R
50|$|On the inside, Rolls-Royce fitted re-designed front seats, and re-angled {{the rear}} seats {{so as to}} allow for easier {{communication}} with other passengers. The clock fascia and instrument dials gained polished metal chaplets that evoke premium watch design. Natural <b>grain</b> <b>leather</b> could now be fitted to the A and C pillars, and two new veneers became available.|$|R
50|$|In August 2009, {{a limited}} (6 units) Bespoke Collection {{model of the}} Phantom was {{introduced}} for the Middle East market. Features included: two-tone Arizona Sun and English White body colours; Crème Light and Saddle Tan natural <b>grain</b> <b>leather</b> upholstery; hand-knotted silk rugs; moccasin carpets; Mother-of-pearl inlays in the control knobs; and an iconic silver dhow-sailboat inlay in the door cappings and fascia panel.|$|R
5000|$|The {{design of}} updated Ghost {{was based on}} Bespoke Ghost Six Sense collection. Changes include soft natural <b>grain</b> <b>leather</b> upholstery, cross banded wood veneers, {{upgraded}} amplifier, addition of [...] "exciter" [...] speakers housed in the leather headlining, Comfort Access allowing {{the opening of the}} boot with foot movement, proximity-based remote boot release mechanism, addition of forged alloy wheel option, a palette of 44,000 exterior paint options.|$|R
50|$|Kip full <b>grain</b> <b>leather</b> was a Water Buffalo hide {{impregnated}} with tallow, {{oils and}} waxes; {{it was made}} in India. Split Kip was split leather and was often used just on the heel (the quarters). The presence of wax and oil made the leather hard, and necessitated a heated Half Round Bottom Glazer for shaping over the last. Kip lasts up to 40 years, but is no longer imported.|$|R
25|$|As in {{previous}} years, the 1985 Ninety-Eight was {{available as a}} 4-door sedan and a 2-door coupe, in either Regency or Regency Brougham trim. Both models came with standard velour seating, with Sierra <b>grain</b> <b>leather</b> optional on both. For the first year, the Buick 181in³ V6 was the standard powerplant. V8 engines were gone for good, never {{to return to the}} Ninety-Eight. Optional engines were Buick's 231 and Oldsmobile's 263in³ Diesel V6. The 3.0 gas V6 and 4.3 Diesel V6 were dropped for 1986.|$|R
5000|$|The Mark X concept model {{features}} a convertible panoramic glass roof. The interior was {{also based on}} a [...] "Lincolnized" [...] version {{of that in the}} standard Thunderbird (which in turn is derived from the Lincoln LS) - which differentiates it from the MK9 interior. The Mark X's interior is, according to Ford Motor Company's press release, [...] "dressed in Lime Sorbet with white Corian accents, polished aluminum, dark chrome, natural <b>grain</b> <b>leather</b> seating surfaces, plush sheepskin flooring and tailored tone-on-tone stitching throughout. Its four-spoke, power-adjustable steering wheel also is leather wrapped." ...|$|R
50|$|Having {{aggregates}} and atomic data {{increases the}} complexity of the dimensional model. This complexity should be transparent to the users of the data warehouse, thus when a request is made, the data warehouse should return data from the table with the <b>correct</b> <b>grain.</b> So when requests to the data warehouse are made, aggregate navigator functionality should be implemented, to help determine the correct table with the <b>correct</b> <b>grain.</b> The number of possible aggregations is determined by every possible combination of dimension granularities. Since it would produce a lot of overhead to build all possible aggregations, {{it is a good idea}} to choose a subset of tables on which to make aggregations. The best way to choose this subset and decide which aggregations to build is to monitor queries and design aggregations to match query patterns.|$|R
50|$|Having {{aggregate}} {{data in the}} dimensional model makes the environment more complex. To make this extra complexity transparent to the user, functionality known as aggregate navigation is used to query the dimensional and fact tables with the <b>correct</b> <b>grain</b> level. The aggregate navigation essentially examines the query {{to see if it}} can be answered using a smaller, aggregate table.|$|R
50|$|Available in Coupé and Convertible bodies, {{they are}} {{versions}} of Jaguar XK Special Edition for the UK market. Changes include new 'Artisan' interiors (scraffito <b>grain</b> <b>leather</b> on the seats, instrument binnacle, door and rear quarter casings, and Poltrona Frau leather headlinings), choice of 2 Jaguar Design-specified interior colours (Navy with Jet headlining, Truffle with Canvas headlining) with Shadow Walnut or Dark Figured Aluminium veneer finishes, 16x16 way heated Performance front seats, a 525 W Bowers & Wilkins sound system, unique treadplates {{and stainless steel}} pedals, three extra body colour choices (Celestial Black, Polaris White, Rhodium Silver), a new 20-inch wheel design option (Orona style with a polished finish).|$|R
50|$|With only 18 cars commissioned, the 2011 Jaguar XKR Poltrona Frau Special Edition {{features}} the personal color palette of Jaguar designer Ian Callum’s very own XKR coupe. This extremely limited 510 horsepower high performance machine features an exclusive Salsa Red and Black Pack exterior, and rests atop 20” gloss black Kalimnos wheels complete with red brake calipers. The interior is {{adorned with a}} specially crafted leather headliner from world-renowned Poltrona Frau, and boasts warm Charcoal soft <b>grain</b> <b>leather</b> complimented by Cranberry contrast stitching and Piano Black veneer.

5000|$|The only type {{of leather}} {{suitable}} for carving is vegetable tanned, full <b>grain</b> <b>leather.</b> This {{is because the}} vegetable tanning process allows the leather to absorb water, {{which is used to}} soften the leather before the carving process, and the <b>grain</b> of the <b>leather</b> is necessary to allow the leather to hold the shape after the carving process is complete. Other leathers lack these two essential qualities.While the process of cutting into the leather and pushing the edges of the cuts in is relatively modern, marking wet leather has been around since the Roman period. There are some beautiful examples of Roman leather at Vindolanda near Hadrian's wall and the book [...] "Purses in Pieces" [...] is very informative with some lovely examples of medieval carved leather work. Historically, tools for stamping leather would probably have been made out of bone, but would not have been too different from what we use today.|$|R
5000|$|Being a {{man-made}} material, it is washable and retains its softness when wet, unlike natural leather. After many decades of development, Clarino has achieved performance that exceeds that of leather in some applications, especially where the item may {{be exposed to}} water, such as riding saddles. Top <b>grain</b> <b>leather</b> applications include [...] "patent leather" [...] shoes that retain high gloss {{without the need for}} polish. During manufacturing it is microscopically perforated to give it breathability similar to that of natural leather. Clarino is based on a non-woven fabric composed of special synthetic fibers that are intertwined three-dimensionally. The material’s softness and suppleness arise from the structure of the non-woven fabric’s special fibers—a superfine fiber construction and tiny cavities.|$|R
5000|$|Model G {{was a huge}} car for the time, {{weighing}} in at about 4,000 lbs. Packard offered it with two body styles: Either as a four passenger Surrey or an eight-passenger Tonneau (sometimes called a [...] "Rear Tonneau Roadster"). The surrey had neither front nor rear doors and came with two forward-facing benches. The tonneau had one bench in front plus two more placed longitudally. Access to the ladder was by a small door in the rear. There were no front doors. Coachwork was made of high quality using wood, probably by a local carriage builder as with other Packards. The customer had a free choice of colors. Upholstery was of qual quality, executed wit top <b>grain</b> <b>leather.</b>|$|R

A wide range of upholstery was available in nine colors of [...] "Sierra" [...] <b>grain</b> <b>leather,</b> four colors of [...] "Matador" [...] cloth, a combination of [...] "Matador" [...] cloth and leather, a [...] "Minuet" [...] fabric in three colors, or a plush [...] "Medici" [...] crushed velour.|$|R
50|$|Master & Dynamic {{was founded}} by Jonathan Levine and Vicki Gross. Levine had {{previously}} launched two consumer product companies, and when his teenage son {{was unable to find}} headphones that appealed to him, Levine realized there was an opportunity in the market. He partnered with Gross to establish Master & Dynamic in 2013. He subsequently came across a pair of 1940s headphones at a Washington, DC museum, and because they had been built with durable materials such as leather and metal, they remained intact. Levine then hired Swedish industrial designer Mårten Wallby and together they designed Master & Dynamic's first headphones and earphones. They were constructed with long lasting materials such as stainless steel, heavy <b>grain</b> <b>leather,</b> forged and machined anodized aluminum and woven copper cable.|$|R
25|$|Early on 14 June 1809, near Cape Croisette {{south of}} Marseilles, Raitt {{encountered}} {{a convoy of}} 14 Spanish merchant vessels and two gunboats. Scout set off in pursuit but after the wind dropped in the afternoon Raitt had to continue the pursuit using his boats. The convoy dispersed as seven of the vessels headed for a small nearby harbour. Scouts boats went in under fire from a shore battery. A landing party captured the battery, spiking the two 6-pounder guns there. The boats then captured and sailed out the seven Spanish vessels. British casualties were one man killed and five wounded. The Spanish vessels were carrying wool, <b>grain,</b> <b>leather,</b> flour and cheese. Raitt destroyed two of the vessels after removing their cargoes; the five others he sent to Port Mahon.|$|R

50|$|The imagery Green {{has used}} {{throughout}} his entire career, {{and continues to}} use to this day, is drawn from illustrated textbooks and advertising of the forties and fifties that touch on technological and roadside Americana, with overt themes of sexual symbolism. Imagery includes ice cream cones, bridges, incomplete bridges, mirrors, scissors, women's painted fingernails, passionate couples, tires, moons floating over water, puzzle pieces, silhouettes of a plane flying overhead, searchlights, tornados, women's nylon-covered legs, wood <b>grain,</b> <b>leather</b> cords, screws, cables, knots, zippers, tapes, stitches, Necker cubes, and other optical illusions. The paintings tend to have torn or stitched imagery that evokes the trompe l'oeil tradition; transparent and solid planes overlap, too, achieving {{a high level of}} spatial complexity. Though the illusory depth of his paintings is not all that deep, the viewer still finds himself looking at, into, and through his paintings.|$|R
50|$|Leathers are {{one-piece}} suits or two-piece {{jackets and}} trousers worn by motorcyclists, mainly for protection in a crash. In most cases, {{the type of}} leather used is not fashion leather but protective leather, which is thicker, stronger, and only moderately flexible. Today, kangaroo leather is becoming popular for its suppleness, light weight, and strength compared to cowhide. Not all leathers used in garments perform equally; products made from full <b>grain,</b> top <b>grain,</b> <b>corrected</b> <b>grain,</b> and suede can have different levels of resistance to abrasion, as well as tearing and bursting forces.|$|R
5000|$|Napa leather is a leather, {{typically}} dyed, {{made from}} kid-, cow-, calf-, lamb- or other skin by tanning. It is {{noted for its}} soft temper. It is a generic term in the leather field and has no distinct test for characterization. Because of this ambiguity, the term is [...] to imply that a leather has a soft hand. Among other uses, Napa leather is often used in leather products such as furniture, clothing, handbags, and shoes. As the term is used today, Napa Leather may be either natural grain, or more likely, <b>corrected</b> <b>grain.</b>|$|R
50|$|Oiling {{provides}} the leather with lubrication and {{allows it to}} flex repeatedly without cracking. Leather fibres that are dry and un-lubricated break very easily. Oiling does impart colour and an element of water resistance. Oiling would normally be performed on full <b>grain</b> aniline <b>leathers.</b> The {{most common type of}} leather oiled is vegetable tanned leather.|$|R
50|$|The kidneys appear symmetrically atrophic {{and there}} is a reduced nephron mass. The kidneys have a surface of diffuse, fine {{granularity}} that resembles <b>grain</b> <b>leather.</b> Microscopically, the basic anatomic change consists of hyaline thickening of the walls of the small arteries and arterioles (hyaline arteriolosclerosis). Under a microscope, this appears as a homogeneous, pink hyaline thickening {{at the expense of the}} vessel lumina, with loss of underlying cellular detail. The narrowing of the lumen restricts blood flow, resulting in ischemia. All structures of the kidney can show ischemic atrophy although glomerular ischemic atrophy may be patchy. In advanced cases of benign nephrosclerosis the glomerular tufts may become globally sclerosed. Diffuse tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis are present. Often there is a scant interstitial lymphocytic infiltrate. The larger blood vessels (interlobar and arcuate arteries) show reduplication of internal elastic lamina along with fibrous thickening of the media (fibroelastic hyperplasia) and the subintima.|$|R
5000|$|In general, {{patent leather}} {{begins as a}} {{superior}} grade of fine <b>grain</b> <b>leather</b> that undergoes a process to achieve the glossy look. An early reference to patent leather is in the 1793 British periodical, The Bee, or Literary Weekly Intelligencer, which notes—in an article entitled [...] "Hand's patent leather"—that [...] "a gentleman {{of the name of}} Hand" [...] in Birmingham, England obtained a patent for preparing flexible leather having a glaze and polish that renders it impervious to water and need only be wiped with a sponge to restore it to its original luster. In November 1799, inventor Edmund Prior of Holborn, London, England received a patent for a method of painting and colouring all kinds of leather, and in January 1805, inventor Charles Mollersten of Hackney Wick received a patent for applying a chemical composition in the preparation of hides, skins, and leather to give [...] "a beautiful gloss". However, patent leather primarily owes its popularity to Seth Boyden.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel method {{developed for the}} segmentation of sedimentary grains in electron microscopy images. The algorithm utilizes the approach of region splitting and merging. In the splitting stage, the marker-based watershed segmentation is used. In the merging phase, the typical characteristics of grains in electron microscopy images are exploited for proposing special metrics, which are then used during the merging stage to obtain a <b>correct</b> <b>grain</b> segmentation. The metrics {{are based on the}} typical intensity changes on the grain borders and the compact shape of grains. The experimental part describes the optimal setting of parameter in the splitting stage and the overall results of the proposed algorithm tested on available database of grains. The results show that the proposed technique fulfills the requirements of its intended application...|$|R
5000|$|Split leather is leather {{created from}} the fibrous {{part of the}} hide left once the top-grain of the rawhide has been {{separated}} from the hide. During the splitting operation, the top-grain and drop split are separated. The drop split can be further split (thickness allowing) into a middle split and a flesh split. In very thick hides, the middle split can be separated into multiple layers until the thickness prevents further splitting. Split leather then has an artificial layer applied {{to the surface of}} the split and is embossed with a <b>leather</b> <b>grain</b> (bycast <b>leather).</b> Splits are also used to create suede. The strongest suedes are usually made from grain splits (that have the grain completely removed) or from the flesh split that has been shaved to the correct thickness. Suede is [...] "fuzzy" [...] on both sides. Manufacturers use a variety of techniques to make suede from full-grain. A reversed suede is a grained leather that has been designed into the leather article with the grain facing away from the visible surface. It is not considered a true suede.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the technological process for manufacturing a low-cut footwear product (type shoe) for women, for casual use, in an IL system. The paper {{begins with a}} general presentation of the technological process of manufacturing the product, and follows with a case study which details the characteristic operations, {{as well as the}} common ones, which take place during the process. Depending on the structure of the model and the characteristics of the raw and auxiliary materials, the technological process used in the manufacture workshops will be laid-out. Product manufacture begins with cutting the materials, in our case the parts being cut from full <b>grain</b> <b>leather,</b> and the lining from lining leather. After the pieces for {{the upper part of the}} shoe are cut according to the guides, they will be assembled using different methods such as: stitching, gluing or fastening. The guides are processed in order to thin out the edges evenly or in a slant, or to decorate them by bending, burning or painting. For stitching the parts a simple two-thread stitch is used, with one or two seams and back-stitches, and the gluing can be temporary or permanent. In the process the time and production quotas are presented, which are influenced by the qualification level of the workers, as well as the performance of the machines used...|$|R
