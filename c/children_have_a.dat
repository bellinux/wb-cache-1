5|$|People {{receiving}} dimercaprol need to {{be assessed}} for peanut allergies since the commercial formulation contains peanut oil. Calcium EDTA is also effective if administered four hours after the administration of dimercaprol. Administering dimercaprol, DMSA (Succimer), or DMPS prior to calcium EDTA is necessary to prevent the redistribution of lead into the central nervous system. Dimercaprol used alone may also redistribute lead to the brain and testes. An adverse side effect of calcium EDTA is renal toxicity. Succimer (DMSA) is the preferred agent in mild to moderate lead poisoning cases. This {{may be the case}} in instances where <b>children</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> blood lead level >25μg/dL. The most reported adverse side effect for succimer is gastrointestinal disturbances. It is also important to note that chelation therapy only lowers blood lead levels and may not prevent the lead-induced cognitive problems associated with lower lead levels in tissue. This may be because of the inability of these agents to remove sufficient amounts of lead from tissue or inability to reverse preexisting damage.|$|E

25|$|Other theorists in {{developmental}} psychology {{have suggested that}} religiosity comes naturally to young children. Specifically, children may have a natural-born conception of mind-body dualism, which lends itself to beliefs that the mind may live on after the body dies.

25|$|The {{theory of}} {{psychological}} pricing is controversial.

Other researchers claim that this ignores the non-rational nature of the phenomenon and that acceptance of the theory requires belief in a subconscious level of thought processes, a belief that economic models tend to deny or ignore. Results from research using modern scanner data are mixed.|$|E

At this age, children also learn to ask questions and negate sentences to develop these questions. Over time, their syntax gets more and more unique and complex.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} this {{experiment}} several results were found.

This study also reveals that young children can be equipped with certain qualities for cognitive operations, depending on how logical the structure of the task is. Research also shows that children develop explicit understanding at age 5 and as a result, the child will count the sweets to decide which has more. Finally the study found that overall quantity conservation is not a basic characteristic of humans' native inheritance.|$|E

25|$|Now {{imagine that}} this woman grows up and has {{children}} with a brown-haired man who also has a Bb genotype. Her eggs will be a mixture of two types, one sort containing the B allele, and one sort the b allele. Similarly, her partner will produce a mix of two types of sperm containing {{one or the other}} of these two alleles. When the transmitted genes are joined up in their offspring, these <b>children</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> chance of getting either brown or red hair, since they could get a genotype of BB = brown hair, Bb = brown hair or bb = red hair. In this generation, there is therefore a chance of the recessive allele showing itself in the phenotype of the children—some of them may have red hair like their grandfather.|$|E
25|$|No {{correlation}} (positive or negative) {{exists between}} intelligence and shyness. Research indicates that shy <b>children</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> harder time expressing their knowledge {{in social situations}} (which most modern curricula utilize) and {{because they do not}} engage actively in discussions, teachers view them as less intelligent. In line with social learning theory, an unwillingness to engage with classmates and teachers makes it more difficult for shy students to learn. Test scores, however, indicate that shyness is unrelated to actual academic knowledge, and therefore only academic engagement. Depending on the level of a teacher's own shyness, more indirect (vs. socially oriented) strategies are used with shy individuals to assess knowledge in the classroom, and accommodations are made. Observed peer evaluations of shy people during initial meeting and social interactions thereafter found that peers evaluate shy individuals as less intelligent during the first encounter. During subsequent interactions, however, peers perceived shy individuals' intelligence more positively.|$|E
25|$|Fostering {{resilience}} {{in children}} requires family environments that are caring and stable, hold {{high expectations for}} children’s behavior and encourage participation {{in the life of}} the family. Most resilient <b>children</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> strong relationship with at least one adult, not always a parent, and this relationship helps to diminish risk associated with family discord. The definition of parental resilience, as the capacity of parents to deliver a competent and quality level of parenting to children, despite the presence of risk factors, has proven to be a very important role in children's resilience. Understanding the characteristics of quality parenting is critical to the idea of parental resilience. Even if divorce produces stress, the availability of social support from family and community can reduce this stress and yield positive outcomes. Any family that emphasizes the value of assigned chores, caring for brothers or sisters, and the contribution of part-time work in supporting the family helps to foster resilience. Resilience research has traditionally focused on the well being of children, with limited academic attention paid to factors that may contribute to the resilience of parents.|$|E

500|$|Brain {{trauma is}} one of the strongest predisposing factors for {{epilepsy}} development, and is an especially important factor in young adults.

500|$|Amphetamine, {{the active}} {{ingredient}} of Adderall, works primarily by increasing {{the activity of the}} neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain. [...] It also triggers the release of several other hormones (e.g., epinephrine) and neurotransmitters (e.g., serotonin and histamine) as well as the synthesis of certain neuropeptides (e.g., cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART) peptides). Both active ingredients of Adderall, dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine, bind to the same biological targets, but their binding affinities (that is, potency) differ somewhat. Dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine are both potent full agonists (activating compounds) of trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) and interact with vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), with dextroamphetamine being the more potent agonist of TAAR1. Consequently, dextroamphetamine produces more [...] stimulation than levoamphetamine; however, levoamphetamine has slightly greater cardiovascular and peripheral effects. It has been reported that certain <b>children</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> better clinical response to levoamphetamine.|$|E

500|$|The Supreme Court has {{previously}} held that citizens have certain fundamental rights {{upon which the}} government cannot infringe, unless the deprivation of that right is necessary to achieve a compelling government interest. This doctrine, arising from the [...] "liberty clause" [...] of the Fourteenth Amendment, is known as substantive due process. The right to privacy {{was found to be}} fundamental under this doctrine, and a number of rights to choice came out of it, such as in Roe v. Wade, where the Court found a right to have an abortion and in Meyer v. Nebraska, where the court found a parental right to raise their children as they wish. In Griswold v. Connecticut the Court extended this doctrine to the right to procure contraception. Substantive due process was further expanded to encompass children with In re Gault establishing that <b>children</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> right to procedural due process when the state attempts to take custody of them.|$|E
