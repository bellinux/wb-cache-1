40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between federal program recipients and interest groups. It is argued here that interest groups attempt to <b>claim</b> <b>credit</b> for federal program benefits. <b>Claiming</b> <b>credit</b> efforts are the activities interest group leaders engage in {{that are designed to}} call attention to the group and generate program recipient support of the group. More directly, <b>credit</b> <b>claiming</b> for program benefits is offered as another means for an interest group to solve its collective action problem. Here, instead of interest group leaders having to produce and provide selective benefits, they are expected to take advantage of their involvement with particular federal programs to resolve their maintenance problems. It is further argued that effective <b>credit</b> <b>claiming</b> must have affective, evaluative, and behavioral impacts on program recipients. The <b>credit</b> <b>claiming</b> model is explored at both the macro-level and micro-levels. Interest group leaders were surveyed to determine whether they engaged in <b>credit</b> <b>claiming</b> for particular programs. Recipients of these same programs were also surveyed in order to determine their relationship with the groups that speak on behalf of their program(s). Key determinants of {{the relationship between}} interest groups and program recipients are found to be: the nature of the federal program benefit (particularistic versus collective); the presence of other interest groups; and the <b>credit</b> <b>claiming</b> activities of the interest group...|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of a “single list” of eligible collateral common to all Eurosystem credit operations on January 1, 2007, replaced the two-tier framework in place until then.

40|$|Drawing from David Mayhew’s {{concept of}} {{legislative}} <b>credit</b> <b>claiming,</b> the authors examine {{the ways in}} which male and female members of Congress engage in credit-claiming activities. Through content analysis of 116 newsletters sent out by male and female members of the 107 th Congress, the authors focus on the frequency of <b>credit</b> <b>claiming,</b> the types of policy issues for which men and women most commonly take credit, and whether members of Congress share credit with other individuals or take sole credit for their accomplishments. They find that women take credit more often than do men but are more balanced in the types of issues they emphasize in their newsletters. In addition, women are less likely than men to share credit with others. These findings suggest that women are cognizant of voter stereotypes and behave in ways that counter any negative implications...|$|R

40|$|<b>Credit</b> <b>claims</b> (or bank loans) {{represent}} {{a large share}} of the collateral accepted by the Eurosystem in its credit operations in recent years. Hence the techniques and procedures used in the use of <b>credit</b> <b>claims</b> as collateral have become significant elements of the monetary policy implementation mechanism in the euro area. The procedures involved in credit claim collateralisation, however, are generally more complex than those for marketable assets traded in regulated markets or in other markets accepted by the Eurosystem. While several types of <b>credit</b> <b>claims</b> are eligible as Eurosystem collateral, each type of credit claim has different characteristics which require specific considerations in the eligibility assessment. This paper provides an overview of the issues involved in the use of <b>credit</b> <b>claims</b> as collateral and relates these to some measures taken by both the public and the private sector aimed at facilitating their use in the euro area. The paper also elaborates on the syndicated loan market in the euro area as this market is sizeable, while it appears that the use of such loans as collateral remains limited...|$|E

40|$|Why {{and how do}} class {{cleavages}} become politicized {{in party}} systems? The recent tenure of left governments in South America has seen the party system realigned along the class cleavage in Venezuela but not in Brazil or Chile. This article argues that different approaches to expanding social protection— “mobilizational ” in Venezuela and “technocratic ” in Brazil and Chile—explain divergent outcomes. Mobilizational policies incentivized social organization among beneficiaries and allowed for linkages between these organizations and left parties, facilitating <b>credit</b> <b>claiming</b> and recruitment by the left. Tech-nocratic policies targeted atomized beneficiaries with no room for partisan involvement, making <b>credit</b> <b>claiming</b> and recruitment difficult. Case-based evidence illustrates these mechanisms whereas survey analysis using genetic matching confirms that mobilizational and technocratic programs exerted strikingly different effects on support for left parties. The broader contribu-tion is to theorize {{a new form of}} class-based political mobilization in Latin America, also being implemented in other countries...|$|R
