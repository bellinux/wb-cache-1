5|$|With half-time fast approaching, Barcelona's {{confidence}} {{began to}} show: first, Messi attempted to flick a {{pass over the}} top of the United defence to Thierry Henry, which Rio Ferdinand intercepted; Iniesta then tried an ambitious back-heel that Van der Sar collected; and finally Messi sped through three Manchester United defenders towards the by-line, only for his <b>cut-back</b> cross to be pounced upon by Van der Sar and then cleared by Vidić. On the stroke of half-time, Iniesta himself then attempted to flick the ball through to Henry, but it was just too high for the French striker, and referee Massimo Busacca took that cue to blow the whistle for the interval.|$|E
25|$|The Mk 22 was {{identical}} to the Mk 21 in all respects except for the <b>cut-back</b> rear fuselage, with the tear-drop canopy, and a more powerful 24 volt electrical system {{in place of the}} 12 volt system of all earlier Spitfires. Most of the Mk 22s were built with enlarged tail surfaces, {{similar to those of the}} Supermarine Spiteful. A total of 287 Mk 22s were built: 260 at Castle Bromwich and 27 by Supermarine at South Marston.|$|E
25|$|The first Griffon-powered Spitfires {{suffered}} from poor high altitude performance due to having {{only a single}} stage supercharged engine. By 1943, Rolls-Royce engineers had developed a new Griffon engine, the 61 series, with a two-stage supercharger. In {{the end it was}} a slightly modified engine, the 65 series, which was used in the Mk XIV. The resulting aircraft provided a substantial performance increase over the Mk IX. Although initially based on the Mk VIII airframe, common improvements made in aircraft produced later included the <b>cut-back</b> fuselage and tear-drop canopies, and the E-Type wing with improved armament.|$|E

25|$|Parma's next {{task was}} {{a trip to}} the country's capital to face high-flying Lazio, who found {{themselves}} in third place after nine games. Despite their good start, Lazio had looked inconsistent at home, winning just once at the Stadio Olimpico. In the first half, there were chances at both ends, but Parma's chances of victory were dealt a blow when Sebastian Giovinco, the club's top scorer and talisman, was forced off the pitch by an injury just after half-time. The game remained goalless until late in the game. A Miroslav Klose run ended with a <b>cut-back</b> to team-mate Libor Kozák, whose shot was cleared off the line by Cristian Zaccardo, but that only left Giuseppe Sculli an easy tap-in to give Lazio the victory after 84 minutes.|$|E
25|$|On 25 August 2010, Crouch {{scored a}} hat-trick at White Hart Lane against Young Boys to help Tottenham {{to reach the}} group stage of the 2010–11 Champions League. On 15 February 2011, Crouch scored {{what turned out to}} be the winning goal in the Champions League second round, first leg match against Milan at the San Siro, {{sweeping}} home Aaron Lennon's <b>cut-back</b> after a counter-attack. Three weeks later, Spurs progressed to the quarter-finals after the reverse fixture at White Hart Lane ended 0–0. On 5 April, he was sent off in the 14th minute after receiving two yellow cards in the quarter-finals against Real Madrid. He scored an own goal against Manchester City, which consequently confirmed City into the Champions League for the 2011–12 season with Tottenham missing out.|$|E
500|$|Midfielder Gilberto Silva {{made his}} {{debut in the}} second half, coming on in place of fellow Brazilian Edu. In the 47th minute, Henry went close to scoring his first goal at the Millennium Stadium; he {{collected}} a pass from Bergkamp and used his pace {{to get past the}} Liverpool defence. His shot caught Dudek and rebounded off the post. Henry created further chances in the 51st and 54th minutes, forcing more saves from the Liverpool goalkeeper. Owen was unable to reach the ball from a corner and Liverpool continued to pressure Arsenal, with Gerrard regaining control of the midfield and making a substitution which saw Danny Murphy come on for Hamann. In spite of this, it was Arsenal who scored the opening goal, in the 68th minute. A move by Liverpool, which had broken down, allowed Gilberto to pass the ball out to Ashley Cole, who in turn fed Bergkamp. His <b>cut-back</b> met the Brazilian's left foot [...] "with a shot that squeezed through Dudek's legs." [...] Diouf went down in the penalty box four minutes after, which provoked a reaction by Vieira, who believed he had dived. Both managers made numerous changes in the final 15 minutes, which included Milan Baroš replacing Heskey and midfielder Kolo Touré on for Bergkamp. The final notable chance went to Liverpool a minute before additional time: Sol Campbell was caught out of position in Arsenal's half, but Diouf's shot went over the goal bar.|$|E

2500|$|A Mk VIII JF299 {{was used}} to {{experiment}} {{with the use of}} a new <b>cut-back</b> rear fuselage and a [...] "tear-drop" [...] canopy. This was intended to aid pilot visibility; many Spitfire pilots who were shot down were done so by enemies who approached in the aircraft's blind spot. In trials, the new hood design was found to bring about great improvements to all-round visibility and with several modifications, was standardised on later Spitfires.|$|E
2500|$|Bituminous surface {{treatment}} (BST) or chipseal is used mainly on low-traffic roads, {{but also as}} a sealing coat to rejuvenate an asphalt concrete pavement.

2500|$|While all labour {{disputes}} {{resulted in}} <b>cut-back</b> programming and numerous repeat airings, the 2005 lockout {{may have been}} the most damaging to CBC. All local programming in the affected regions was cancelled and replaced by abbreviated national newscasts and national radio morning shows. BBC World (television) and World Service (radio) and Broadcast News feeds were used to provide the remainder of original news content, and the CBC website consisted mainly of rewritten wire copy. Some BBC staff protested against their material being used during the CBC lockout. [...] "The NUJ and BECTU will not tolerate their members' work being used against colleagues in Canada", said a joint statement by BBC unions. The CMG questioned whether, with its limited Canadian news content, the CBC was meeting its legal requirements under the Broadcasting Act and its CRTC licences.|$|E

2500|$|Although de Havilland {{stated that}} they {{generally}} concurred with BEA, its management also {{stated that they}} had worked [...] "under terms more onerous than anything D.H. had previously undertaken". Industry observers at the time felt that the British aircraft industry had again stumbled [...] "into the pitfall of having designed exclusively for one customer an aeroplane that has potentially a much wider scope": a sentiment which would be echoed throughout the Trident's subsequent history. The de Havilland board elected to submit to BEA's demand, overriding input from its own sales and market research departments which indicated that other airlines sought the larger model instead. It was, however, noted that de Havilland had not yet secured a formal and final BEA order and that its competitor Bristol was actively promoting their 200 [...] project, which was significantly smaller than the D.H.121. At the time Boeing and Douglas were also downsizing their DC-9 and 727 projects. It was felt the original large D.H.121 would have to compete against the Convair 880 and Boeing 720 some four years after their service entries, whereas a <b>cut-back</b> design would be more competitive against the then-projected 75–100 seat, twin-engined DC-9.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Cut-back</b> asphalt {{concrete}} {{is a form}} of cold mix asphalt produced by dissolving the binder in kerosene or another lighter fraction of petroleum prior to mixing with the aggregate.
