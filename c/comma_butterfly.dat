In a laboratory experiment using blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, as predators, we show that the comma increased survival, since the blue tits attacked <b>butterflies</b> with overpainted <b>commas</b> more often than sham-painted <b>butterflies</b> with intact <b>commas.</b> In a field experiment we placed hibernating, similarly manipulated, <b>comma</b> <b>butterflies</b> on tree trunks of two different species and noted their survival.

40|$|Abstract In most {{phytophagous}} insects, the larval diet strongly affects future {{fitness and}} in species {{that do not}} feed on plant parts as adults, larval diet is {{the main source of}} nitrogen. In many of these insect–host plant systems, the immature larvae are considered to be fully dependent on the choice of the mothers, who, in turn, possess a highly developed host recognition system. This circumstance allows for a potential mother–offspring conflict, resulting in the female maximizing her fecundity at the expense of larval performance on suboptimal hosts. In two experiments, we aimed to investigate this relationship in the polyphagous <b>comma</b> <b>butterfly,</b> Polygonia c-album, by comparing the relative acceptance of low- andmedium-ranked hosts between females and neonate larvae both within individuals between life stages, and between mothers and their offspring. The study shows a variation between females in oviposition acceptance of low-ranked hosts, and that the degree of acceptance in the mothers correlates with the probability of acceptance of the same host in the larvae. We also found a negative relationship between stages within individuals as there was a higher acceptance of lower ranked hosts in females who had abandoned said host as a larva. Notably, however, neonate larvae of the <b>comma</b> <b>butterfly</b> did not unconditionally accept to feed from the least favorable host species even when it was the only food source. Our results suggest the possibility that the disadvantages associated with a generalist oviposition strategy can be decreased by larval participation in host plant choice.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{mechanisms}} that shape the host plant range of herbivorous insect are to date {{not well understood}} but knowledge of these mechanisms and the selective forces that influence them can expand {{our understanding of the}} larger ecological interaction. Nevertheless, it is well established that chemical defenses of plants influence the host range of herbivorous insects. While host plant chemistry is influenced by phylogeny, also the growth forms of plants appear to influence the plant defense strategies as first postulated by Feeny (the "plant apparency" hypothesis). In the present study we aim to investigate the molecular basis of the diverse host plant range of the <b>comma</b> <b>butterfly</b> (Polygonia c-album) by testing differential gene expression in the caterpillars on three host plants that are either closely related or share the same growth form. Results In total 120 genes were identified to be differentially expressed in P. c-album after feeding on different host plants, 55 of them in the midgut and 65 in the restbody of the caterpillars. Expression patterns could be confirmed with an independent method for 14 of 27 tested genes. Pairwise similarities in upregulation in the midgut of the caterpillars were higher between plants that shared either growth form or were phylogenetically related. No known detoxifying enzymes were found to be differently regulated in the midgut after feeding on different host plants. Conclusion Our data suggest a complex picture of gene expression in response to host plant feeding. While each plant requires a unique gene regulation in the caterpillar, both phylogenetic relatedness and host plant growth form appear to influence the expression profile of the polyphagous <b>comma</b> <b>butterfly,</b> in agreement with phylogenetic studies of host plant utilization in butterflies. </p...|$|E

50|$|Despite the {{uncertainty}} inherent in predictions of future suitable habitat, {{some studies have}} demonstrated that predictions can be quite accurate. A study of Hesperia <b>comma</b> <b>butterflies</b> in Britain identified unoccupied habitat sites that were likely to support the species under a warmer climate based on their similarity to occupied sites. As the climate warmed, the butterfly colonized many of the sites; most of the sites it did not colonize were located far from existing populations, suggesting they were uncolonized because the butterfly could not reach them on its own. The data suggested that the suitable, uncolonized sites could be good targets for assisted colonization. The results suggested that if investigators can demonstrate their model makes reliable predictions with real-world data, models might be trusted for informing assisted colonization decisions.|$|R

40|$|Life-history theory {{predicts that}} organisms should invest {{resources}} into intrinsic components of lifespan {{only to the}} degree that it pays off in terms of reproductive success. The benefit of a long life may differ between the sexes and different mating systems may therefore select for different sex-specific mortality rates. In insects with polyandrous mating systems, females mate throughout their lives and male reproductive success is likely to increase monotonously with lifespan. In monandrous systems, where the mating season is less protracted because receptive females are available only {{at the beginning of the}} flight season, male mating success should be less dependent on a long lifespan. Here, we show, in a laboratory experiment without predation, that the duration of the mating season is longer in the polyandrous <b>comma</b> <b>butterfly,</b> Polygonia c-album, than in the monandrous peacock butterfly, Inachis io, and that, in line with predictions, male lifespan is shorter than female lifespan in I. io, whereas male and female lifespans are similar in P. c-album...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. 1. Many {{studies have}} {{identified}} different factors influencing clutch-size regulation, primarily within various groups of insects. One prediction is that ovipositing females should increase clutch size with host quality. However, in many studies {{it is not}} clear whether ovipositing females are responding to host quality or quantity. 2. Females of the polyphagous <b>comma</b> <b>butterfly,</b> Polygonia c-album (L.), were allowed to oviposit on two hosts differing greatly in quality: the preferred host, stinging nettle (Urtica dioica L.), and the low-ranked host, birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh). Ovipositing females were observed visually and clutch sizes were recorded. The experiment was repeated in three different years; in total, 938 observations of oviposition events were made. 3. In all three years, females ovipositing on U. dioica laid larger clutches (median 1. 6 – 1. 85) compared with females ovipositing on B. pubescens (median 1. 0 – 1. 3). The difference was significant in two out of three years and when all three years were pooled. 4. Thus, P. c-album females exhibit clutch-size regulation, with larger clutches on better hosts. It is suggested that the proximate mechanism is likely to be a response to the same stimuli used for female ranking of host plants in the preference hierarchy...|$|E

Zoological Studies 48 (3) : 291 - 297. The Asian <b>comma</b> <b>butterfly</b> Polygonia c-aureum has seasonal morphs of summer- and autumn-types, {{the development of}} which is determined by photoperiod and temperature during larval stages in close relation to the determination of adult reproductive diapause. In this paper, we investigated how the period of reproductive diapause changes in response to photoperiodic conditions available after adult emergence by determining ovarian development in female butterflies of each morph-type. Females of autumn-morph types did not produce eggs for about 80 d under short-day conditions at 20 °C. When they were transferred to long-day conditions at 20 °C after emergence, however, these females began to accumulate yolk within 8 d, and in ovaries about 15 d later, the female possessed more than 3 eggs in each ovariole, totaling> 24 eggs. When females of the summer-morph type were transferred to short-day conditions at 20 °C after emergence, their ovarian maturation was delayed and took about twice as long {{compared to that of}} females continuously exposed to long-day conditions. The maintenance of adult diapause- or non-diapause-type reproductive activity thus respectively requires short...|$|E
40|$|We tested {{predictions}} {{from the}} theory that ovipositing females of phytophagous insects are limited by their neural capacity for information processing. Previous {{studies have found that}} relatively specialized insects make faster and/or more accurate identifications of host plants compared to generalists. The study species was the polyphagous <b>comma</b> <b>butterfly,</b> Polygonia c-album (Nymphalidae). We compared females originating from two populations (Sweden and England) which differ in degree of specialization on the preferred host Urtica dioica (Urticaceae). Females were given a choice between this plant and a very similar nonhost, white dead nettle, Laminum album (Lamiacease), or a choice between a relatively poor host, Betuala pubescens, and the nonhost Betula pendula (Betulaceae). Oviposition rate was lower in cages with Betula compared to cages with Urtica, demonstrating that P. c-album females will withhold eggs when preferred hosts are not available. As predicted, females originating from the Swedish generalist population oviposited more often on the nonhost Lamium. However, females of both populations discriminated very strongly against oviposition on B. pendula. We found that newly hatched larvae have some ability to move from herbaceous nonhost to hosts. Although alternative interpretations are possible, the results give further support to the hypothesis that there are trade-offs between diet breadth and the ability to discriminate among plants.

40|$|The {{potentially}} multivoltine <b>comma</b> <b>butterfly,</b> Polygonia c-album L., hibernates in {{the adult}} stage. The adult seasonal morph is demonstrated {{to be a good}} indicator of whether an individual has entered reproductive diapause or is developing directly to sexual maturation. This fact, and the assumption that a short development time is not equally important to all categories of individuals, was used to test predictions on variation in life-history traits among categories (morphs and sexes) and environments (temperature and photoperiod) at the level of individuals and to some extent families and populations (the univoltine Stockholm population and the partially bivoltine Oxford population). Individuals developing to adults in a short time were expected to be smaller and lighter {{as a result of a}} basic trade-off between the two traits. Development times varied in accordance with predictions, but in most cases this was due to plastic growth and development in both the larval and pupal stages rather than through variation in size or weight, i. e. size was a highly canalized trait. This suggests a relationship between plasticity and canalization and a strong potential for plasticity to shield life-history traits from selection. Individuals regulated development times also within developmental pathways, in response to photoperiods indicating the progression of the season. These and other results suggest that development times are not normaily minimized in temperat...|$|E
40|$|In the Lepidoptera, {{sex-linked}} genes {{have been}} found to be of importance for species differences in, for example, hostplant preference, and have been implicated in ecological speciation. Variation within species is typically not sexlinked. However, in the <b>comma</b> <b>butterfly</b> Polygonia c-album (Nymphalidae) an X-linked gene has been found to play a major role in determining differences in host-plant use between two well separated populations. For this reason, we studied the role of sex-linked genes for host-plant preference within a single Swedish population of this species. Three generations of females with known pedigrees were studied in the laboratory, and they were given a choice between Urtica dioica and Salix caprea in flight cages. We found strong variation among females and significant genetic variance for host-plant preference, but no evidence for major importance of sex linkage of host-plant preference on this local scale. To what extent the observed genetic variation was due to additive genes and/or effects of major genes was not clear from the maximum likelihood analysis. In a follow-up study we sampled females over a larger area. We found strong variation among females, but not among localities, suggesting an open population structure with strong gene flow. From the combined stock, a selection experiment was performed over 2 years and six generations. The selection lines diverged after the first generation of selection and remained separate, but did not diverge further, suggesting a low degree of narrow-sense heritability and that the genetic differences may be effects of major genes. We discuss these results in relation to the possible role of genetics in the radiation of the Lepidoptera and other phytophagous insect...|$|E
40|$|There is much {{evidence}} that herbivory {{is a key}} innovation for the tremendous success of insect. In this thesis I have investigated different aspects of host plant utilization and phenotypic plasticity using the polyphagous <b>comma</b> <b>butterfly,</b> Polygonia c-album. Even though external conditions affect a phenotypic plastic response, the outcome is often influenced by a genetic background which may differ among populations. In Paper I we suspected the genetic background to seasonal polymorphism to be X-linked. However, results from interspecific hybridization between two populations suggested that diapause response is instead inherited in a mainly autosomally additive fashion, with a possible influence of sexual antagonism on males. In Paper II we showed that female oviposition preference is not a plastic response influenced by larval experience, but has a genetic background coupled to host plant suitability. Further, {{there is a strong}} individual correlation between larval host plant acceptance and female host plant specificity (Paper III). We believe this to be a larval feed-back genetically linked to female host specificity: offspring to ‘choosy’ specialist mothers benefit by remaining on the original host while offspring to less discriminating generalist mothers should risk inspecting the surroundings, thus compensating for potential poor female choice. In the larval mid-gut, genes are differentially expressed depending on host plant diet (Paper IV). Therefore, we expected to find fitness consequences of host plant switch. However, although growth rate was affected in a few treatments, larvae were generally surprisingly good at adjusting to new diets (Paper V). To conclude, host plant choice in both female and larval life stage is connected to performance. Combined with increased understanding about the plastic response to diet intake and seasonal polymorphism we have gained further insights into the processes of local adaptations and speciation in the Lepidoptera.
