2500|$|Even Wisden {{noted that}} Lawrence was a [...] "cheerful" [...] cricketer. The history of Somerset cricket {{put it at}} greater length: [...] "His cheerful {{disposition}} was much to the liking of the dressing-room occupants, though his non-conformist attitudes, including his much-voiced disapproval of what is quaintly called industrial language, <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too inhibiting for those with a bent for freewheeling linguistics {{at the end of}} an unrewarding afternoon in the sun." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "'If you <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more definite--a {{little less}} vague--because I am a stranger, {{and there are}} many foxes, as you will know even better than I, and unless I know which one it is that you desire to identify, and----' ...|$|E

60|$|I made a rough {{sort of a}} calculation, {{and came}} to the {{conclusion}} that the room <b>could</b> <b>be</b> made <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more like <b>a</b> palace for about eight dollars.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Lie down by me; please {{put your}} arms round me. There! Oh! {{it is so}} comfortable. Why did I never find it out before? I wish I <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> child, and begin again from the time my father made me over to you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But,' said Anne diffidently, {{seeing that}} her cousin {{was in a}} graver mood this evening, 'do not you think that perhaps if you <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more companionable to Kate, and not say things so evidently {{for the sake of}} contradiction, you might gain a little useful influence?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Louis," [...] I said, [...] "it {{would make}} me much more {{comfortable}} if you <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more candid. You might tell me in plain words what these men want from Delora. How am I {{to know that he}} is not the thief, and these others are seeking only their own?" ...|$|E
50|$|Locke revised his {{survey the}} {{following}} year, {{finding that the}} worst gradients <b>could</b> <b>be</b> eased <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> but now money was suddenly hard to come by, and a proposed trunk railway was inopportune.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{wonder if}} musty philosophers, like Socrates and Aristotle, and old-fashioned poets, like Shakespeare and Milton, are not safer company {{for him to}} keep {{than some of the}} more modern friends you have?" [...] said Rose, remembering Jamie's hints about wild oats, for she <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sharp {{sometimes}} and had not lectured [...] "the boys" [...] for so long it seemed unusually pleasant.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My poor fellow, I {{want you}} to {{understand}} that I wish to help you, to do all in my power to restore to you that which you seem to have lost! I can sympathise with your desire to quit life altogether now that the best part of it, sight, seems gone. I do not pretend to judge the actions of my fellows; and if you determine to carry out your purpose I shall not be able to prevent you for ever. I shall not try to. But you certainly shall not do so till you know what I know! I had wished to wait till I <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more certain before I took you into confidence with regard to my guessing as to the future. But your desire to destroy yourself forces my hand. Now {{let me tell you that}} there is a possibility of the removal of the cause of your purpose.' ...|$|E
60|$|When attired, Madame Beck {{appeared}} a personage {{of a figure}} rather short and stout, yet still graceful in its own peculiar way; that is, with the grace resulting from proportion of parts. Her complexion was fresh and sanguine, not too rubicund; her eye, blue and serene; her dark silk dress fitted her as a French sempstress alone can make a dress fit; she looked well, though a little bourgeoise; as bourgeoise, indeed, she was. I know not what of harmony pervaded her whole person; and yet her face offered contrast, too: its features {{were by no means}} such as are usually seen in conjunction with a complexion of such blended freshness and repose: their outline was stern: her forehead was high but narrow; it expressed capacity and some benevolence, but no expanse; nor did her peaceful yet watchful eye ever know the fire which is kindled in the heart or the softness which flows thence. Her mouth was hard: it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> grim; her lips were thin. For sensibility and genius, with all their tenderness and temerity, I felt somehow that Madame would be the right sort of Minos in petticoats.|$|E
5000|$|Stoute {{described}} Ajdal {{by saying}} that [...] "as a sprinter he wasn't as good as Marwell, who'd be the best sprinter we had, but he beat the best around and he <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> better if we'd have clicked earlier {{what we were doing}} with him." ...|$|R
5000|$|Commenting in 2007 on the {{perception}} of him as 'difficult', Wheldon said [...] "I put everything into my racing, and I expect the same back. If I see people who aren't giving it I'm not afraid to say so but that sometimes comes out <b>a</b> <b>little</b> brash. That <b>could</b> <b>be</b> improved <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit." ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{before each}} poster <b>could</b> <b>be</b> seen <b>a</b> <b>little</b> eddy {{in the stream}} of the passers-by--formed by persons glancing at the news, and {{disengaging}} themselves, to press on again. The Earl of Valleys caught himself wondering {{what they thought of}} it! What was passing behind those pale rounds of flesh turned towards the posters? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At last, at {{a dinner}} at his house, when all the guests but one had {{successively}} departed; this remaining guest, an old acquaintance, being just enough {{under the influence of}} wine to set aside the fear of touching upon a delicate point, ventured, in a way which perhaps spoke more favorably for his heart than his tact, to beg of his host to explain the one enigma of his life. Deep melancholy overspread the before cheery face of Charlemont; he sat for some moments tremulously silent; then pushing a full decanter towards the guest, in a choked voice, said: 'No, no! when by art, and care, and time, flowers are made to bloom over a grave, who would seek to dig all up again only to know the mystery?--The wine.' When both glasses were filled, Charlemont took his, and lifting it, added lowly: 'If ever, in days to come, you shall see ruin at hand, and, thinking you understand mankind, shall tremble for your friendships, and tremble for your pride; and, partly through love for the one and fear for the other, shall resolve to be beforehand with the world, and save it from a sin by prospectively taking that sin to yourself, then will you do as one I now dream of once did, and like him will you suffer; but how fortunate and how grateful should you be, if like him, after all that had happened, you <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> happy again.' ...|$|E
60|$|She {{leaned back}} in the car. They had turned round now and were {{on the way back to}} Monte Carlo by the higher road. She sat with her eyes fixed upon the mountains. Her heart, in a way, had been touched, her {{imagination}} stirred by her husband's words. She felt a return of that glow of admiration which had thrilled her on the previous night, when he and Richard Lane alone amongst that motley company had played the part of men. A curious, almost pathetic wistfulness crept into her heart. If only he would lean towards her at that moment, if she could see once more the light in his eyes that had shone there during the days of their courtship! If only he could remember that it was still his part to play the lover! If he <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> less grave, a little less hopelessly correct and fair! Despite her efforts to disbelieve, there was something convincing about his words. At any moment during that brief space of time, a single tremulous word, even a warm clasp of the hand, would have brought her into his arms. But so much of inspiration was denied him. He sat waiting for her decision with an eagerness of which he gave no sign. Nevertheless, the fates were fighting for him. She thought gratefully, even at that moment, yet with less enthusiasm than ever before, of the devout homage, the delightful care for her happiness and comfort, the atmosphere of security with which Draconmeyer seemed always to surround her. Yet all this was cold and unsatisfying, a poor substitute for the other things. Henry had been different once. Perhaps it was jealousy which had altered him. Perhaps his misconception of Draconmeyer's character had affected his whole outlook. She turned towards him, and her voice, when she spoke, was no longer querulous.|$|E

If Dick <b>could</b> <b>be</b> made <b>a</b> <b>little</b> jealous it would hurry him up. And he <b>could</b> <b>be</b> made jealous if you had any spunk about you." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{in spite}} of his frights, Whitefoot kept on. You see, he was more afraid to stop than he was to go on. He just had to get as far from Shadow the Weasel as he <b>could.</b> <b>Being</b> such <b>a</b> <b>little</b> fellow, what would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> short {{distance}} for you or me <b>is</b> <b>a</b> long distance for Whitefoot.|$|R
50|$|The {{automatic}} cleanup feature has {{advantages and}} disadvantages though. The advantage is that the developer no longer needs to worry about adding cleanup code, as it is called automatically. However, the disadvantage is that the code <b>could</b> potentially <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> slower, as the code to perform the cleanup needs to run each time <b>a</b> connection <b>is</b> returned from the connection pool.|$|R
5000|$|Musician {{and record}} coproducer Ralph Terrana has been quoted: [...] "He Campbell {{was a very}} talented writer. He also <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> unusual. We called him Crazy Mike." ...|$|E
5000|$|SSI sold 32,364 {{copies of}} Unlimited Adventures. Computer Gaming World in 1993 called it [...] "the best adventure-construction kit available" [...] despite the [...] "sorely lacking" [...] Gold Box engine. According to GameSpy in 2004, {{although}} [...] "the game's graphics were poor ... {{and using the}} tools <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> complicated, Unlimited Adventures was an excellent tool for budding RPG designers".|$|E
50|$|Fund {{management}} companies gather {{pools of}} money from many investors {{and use them to}} purchases securities. These funds are managed by professional investment managers, which may generate higher returns with reduced risks by asset diversification. The size of these funds <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> as a few millions or as much as multibillions. The purpose of these funding activities is mainly aiming to pursue individual or organisation profits.|$|E
5000|$|He {{declared}} himself {{open to the}} county's taking over the city of Maricopa in the event it would be disincorporated. [...] "It's sad," [...] he said. [...] "When you drive down the street almost all the businesses are boarded up. It <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> quaint <b>little</b> place, but investors {{would want to know}} that the city was going to be liquid and provide necessary services." ...|$|R

50|$|According to Lonely Planet and Ghana-Net, {{it is not}} {{considered}} the highest mountain because the difference in elevation between its base and its peak is too small. This interpretation <b>could</b> <b>be</b> considered <b>a</b> <b>little</b> unusual given its obvious prominence over Mount Afadja.

5000|$|Dann Florek noted to TV Guide; [...] "It {{looks like}} he <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> shady, and it's up to Cragen to say, 'I know Brian and he's a good cop,'"; Detective Brian Cassidy (Dean Winters), is now an {{undercover}} cop who {{is involved in the}} team's latest case. Unfortunately, Detective Amaro (Danny Pino) doesn't quite believe him. [...] "It's contentious with Amaro," [...] Pino says. [...] "Dean's character is not as affable as Amaro would like." ...|$|E
50|$|From its {{emergence}} in the mid-17th century, the Religious Society of Friends, later {{known as}} the Quakers, faced religious persecution in England. As Dissenters, their opposition to maintaining a leadership hierarchy or indeed any clergy at all was considered blasphemous and heretical, and members often met in secret. Many emigrated to the American colonies, where they <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more relaxed, but although their numbers grew they did not feel safe being open in their meetings until the mid-18th century.|$|E
