40|$|The Asset Backed CDS {{contract}} {{was introduced in}} 2005 {{as an extension of}} the standard corporate CDS. It generally trades under the ISDA "pay-as-you-go'' (PAUG) confirmation which handles the unique features of ABS - amortization, principal writedowns and <b>interest</b> <b>shortfalls.</b> The <b>current</b> market standard for pricing is a simple adaptation of the widely used intensity based model, where the amortization schedule of the security is deterministic. Taking example from some European ABS, we establish stylized facts about their default. In particular, we show that principal writedowns often come along with an extension of the ABS' maturity and can also be preceded by <b>interest</b> <b>shortfalls.</b> This paper introduces adjustments to the classical framework to account for these specificities, with amortization profile becoming a default-dependent function. We show that the resulting duration becomes an increasing function of spread, capturing the fact that distressed ABS shift toward slower amortization. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{stochastic}} part {{is purely}} random; it can either help the <b>current</b> <b>interest</b> rate deviate from its long term mean or the reverse. Because this part is {{multiplied by the}} square root of the <b>current</b> <b>interest</b> rate, when the <b>current</b> <b>interest</b> rate is low, its impact is minimum, thus leading to the unlikelihood of the interest rate going below zero, and the interest rate cannot be negative. However, {{the reverse is true}} if the current rate is high.|$|R

40|$|Mass {{conservation}} equation of non-renewable resources is employed {{to study the}} resources remaining in the reservoir according to the extraction policy. The energy {{conservation equation}} is transformed into an energy-capital conservation equation. The Hotelling rule is {{shown to be a}} special case of the general energy-capital conservation equation when the mass flow rate of extracted resources is equal to unity. Mass and energy-capital conservation equations are then coupled and solved together. It is investigated the price evolution of extracted resources. The conclusion of the Hotelling rule for non-extracted resources, i. e. an exponential increase of the price of non-renewable resources at the rate of <b>current</b> <b>interest,</b> is then generalized. A new parameter, called "Price Increase Factor", PIF, is introduced as the difference between the <b>current</b> <b>interest</b> rate of capital and the mass flow rate of extraction of non-renewable resources. The price of extracted resources can increase exponentially only if PIF is greater than zero or if the mass flow rate of extraction is lower than the <b>current</b> <b>interest</b> rate of capital. The price is constant if PIF is zero or if the mass flow rate of extraction is equal to the <b>current</b> <b>interest</b> rate. The price is decreasing with time if PIF is smaller than zero or if the mass flow rate of extraction is higher than the <b>current</b> <b>interest</b> rate. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
