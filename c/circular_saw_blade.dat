25|$|A {{table saw}} or {{sawbench}} is a woodworking tool, {{consisting of a}} <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> <b>blade,</b> mounted on an arbor, that is driven by an electric motor (either directly, by belt, or by gears). The blade protrudes through {{the surface of a}} table, which provides support for the material, usually wood, being cut.|$|E
25|$|A biscuit joiner (or {{sometimes}} plate joiner) is a {{woodworking tool}} used to join {{two pieces of}} wood together. A biscuit joiner uses a small <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> to cut a crescent-shaped hole (called the mouth) in the opposite edges of two pieces of wood or wood composite panels. An oval-shaped, highly dried and compressed wooden biscuit (beech or particle wood) is covered with glue, or glue is applied in the slot. The biscuit is immediately placed in the slot, and the two boards are clamped together. The wet glue expands the biscuit, further improving the bond.|$|E

50|$|The next {{improvement}} {{was the use}} of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> <b>blades,</b> perhaps invented in England in the late 18th century, but perhaps in 17th-century Holland, the Netherlands. Soon thereafter, millers used gangsaws, which added additional blades so that a log would be reduced to boards in one quick step. <b>Circular</b> <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> were extremely expensive and highly subject to damage by overheating or dirty logs. A new kind of technician arose, the sawfiler. Sawfilers were highly skilled in metalworking. Their main job was to set and sharpen teeth. The craft also involved learning how to hammer a saw, whereby a saw is deformed with a hammer and anvil to counteract the forces of heat and cutting. The Modern <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> have replaceable teeth, but still need to be hammered.|$|R

40|$|Material-saving and {{energy-saving}} {{belong to}} the basic requirements imposed on contemporary manufacturing processes. The realization of these processes gives measurable profi ts, not only economical but also ecological. In the case of wood <b>sawing</b> with <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> <b>blades,</b> material and energy-savings are dependent on total overall set of teeth (theoretical kerf) and teeth position accuracy {{in relation to the}} workpiece. Hence, it is necessary to achieve a decrease of both raw material and energy losses by the use of narrow-kerf <b>saw</b> <b>blades,</b> an increase of sawing accuracy, as well as a reduction of spacing in case of sawing with a gang of <b>circular</b> <b>saws.</b> However, meeting these requirements in the case of rip <b>sawing</b> with <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> is a quite diffi cult issue and depends on many factors. The detailed analyses concerning ways of chip transportation in the kerf slot, <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> stiffness, <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> movement and workpiece feeding accuracy are the proof of these inconvenient technical problems in sawmills. Hence, the realization of economical wood <b>sawing</b> with <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> seems not to be viable until the whole system of sawing fulfils the defined requirements. Thanks to the application of the proecological technology (<b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> of a new design), in the examined industrial case, the following results have been achieved: an increase of about 18 % in the amount of side lumber, roughly 16 % less sawdust (as an effect of kerf reduction) and about 16 % lower values of the cutting power consumption...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{substrate}} surface preparation {{on the performance}} and tool life of titanium nitride (TiN) coated high speed steel <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> {{has been shown to}} be significant [1]. The influence this has on the wear and failure characteristics of the blades is now considered. Previous work by the authors shows TiN coated high speed steel <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> benefit from substrate surface preparation prior to treatment. Cutting test results show that blades which had undergone a microblasting process exhibited an increase in tool life. Using testing methods developed to simulate the cutting action of full <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> by using representative saw segments, the effects of substrate surface preparation are further investigated by identifying and comparing the wear mechanisms that develop on <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> teeth subject to various preparation/coating conditions. Assessment of the wear and failure mechanisms associated with each combination of substrate preparation/coating have been used to appraise the relative merits of the treatment, blade design and manufacturing process. The work will assist in the development of a systems approach that combines both cutting tool and surface engineering technologies with a view to developing an improved product...|$|R

40|$|To {{improve the}} static and dynamic {{properties}} of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> <b>blades,</b> residual stresses {{in the steel}} blade are induced by roll tensioning.

To investigate the mechanisms and the optimization possibilities of the roll tensioning process the simulative analysis of this process will be performed. Thus the relationship of the rolling parameter and the dynamic behavior of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> can be determined. A variety of approaches of the modeling of induced residual stresses due to the rolling process are shown and evaluated. For this purpose, the correlations of developed simulation models with test samples by experimental investigations are being used...|$|R
