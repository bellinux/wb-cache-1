5|$|A {{part of the}} South Downs, Willingdon Down is a {{designated}} Site of Special Scientific Interest. This is of archaeological interest due to a Neolithic camp and burial grounds. The area is also a nationally uncommon tract of <b>chalk</b> <b>grassland</b> rich in species. Another SSSI which partially falls with the Eastbourne district is Seaford to Beachy Head. This site, of biological and geological interest, covers the coastline between Eastbourne and Seaford, plus the Seven Sisters country park and the Cuckmere valley.

5|$|Some {{plants and}} animals are generalists, and their habitat {{requirements}} are met {{in a wide range}} of locations. The small white butterfly (Pieris rapae) for example is found on all the continents of the world apart from Antarctica. Its larvae feed on a wide range of Brassicas and various other plant species, and it thrives in any open location with diverse plant associations. The large blue butterfly is much more specific in its requirements; it is found only in <b>chalk</b> <b>grassland</b> areas, its larvae feed on Thymus species and because of complex lifecycle requirements it inhabits only areas in which Myrmica ants live.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of the Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) on the Isle of Wight, England. The Isle of Wight is {{an island}} and county three miles off the south coast of England in the English Channel. Its geology is complex, with a chalk downland ridge running east to west through its centre and {{important}} fossil beds from the Lower Cretaceous to the Lower Tertiary around the coast. This geology gives rise to many distinct habitats, with strong maritime influences, including <b>chalk</b> <b>grassland,</b> neutral meadows, and broad-leaved woodland. The Isle of Wight has a population of 140,000, {{making it one of the}} country's smaller counties in terms of population.|$|E
25|$|For the Norton Bavant Chalk Downland Edge, the 'character' of {{this area}} {{encompasses}} three distinctive, steeply sloping hills (Middle Hill, Scratchbury Hill, and Cotley Hill), which form a distinct and somewhat isolated unit of Chalk Downland Edge. The hills are covered with long fields, which are predominantly arable, with occasional patches of rough remnant <b>chalk</b> <b>grassland</b> and scrub situated {{on the top of}} the hills. Many <b>chalk</b> <b>grassland</b> slopes in England show the mark of centuries of grazing by sheep, the slopes bearing a stepped or striped appearance formed by a mixture of soil creep and sheep paths, and such erosion is visible on the slopes of Scratchbury Hill. Regular patches and belts of mixed woodland populate parts of the lower slopes. Imber military range perimeter paths run across the top of the hills, providing public access to the area.|$|E

25|$|The review {{presented}} five options â€” {{the published}} tunnel scheme, a {{cut and cover}} tunnel, a 'partial solution' (involving a roundabout but maintaining the current road), and two overland bypass routes. Some of these plans have been criticised as being damaging to both archaeology and biodiversity, including the stone curlew, barn owls, bats, and the <b>chalk</b> <b>grassland</b> habitat. Five options were considered including diverting the A303 further away and only closing the A344.

25|$|The SSSI {{designation}} for {{the site}} arises due to interest in the biodiversity and species present upon the earthworks of the fort themselves, with the inner and surrounding parts of the site being of improved agricultural grassland of little interest. The earthworks support a rich <b>chalk</b> <b>grassland</b> flora, including for several rare species. There are 16 species of grass and sedge recorded; with upright brome (Bromus erectus), sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina), quaking grass (Briza media), crested hair-grass (Koeleria cristata), and dwarf sedge (Carex humilis). Various herb species include for dwarf thistle (Cirsium acaule), chalk milkwort (Polygala calcarea), horseshoe vetch (Hippocrepis comosa), common thyme (Thymus praecox), squinancywort (Asperula cynanchica) and common rock-rose (Helianthemum nummularium).|$|E

40|$|While Entodon concinnus was {{considered}} almost extinct in the Netherlands, {{no less than}} six â€˜newâ€™ localities were discovered in 1990 / 91, {{all of them in}} elevated parts of outer-meadows along branches of the Rhine system (fig. 2). This moss appeared to thrive on somewhat open spots in the turf of dry pastures on lime-rich sand containing traces of clay, especially on mole-hills and on south-exposed slopes. All sites are grazed part of the year {{and most of them are}} situated in nature reserves. The vegetation in which Entodon occurs, belongs to the association Medicagini-Avenetum pubescentis (table 1). The 10 relevÃ©s show a striking mutual similarity: constant species (present in 7 or more relevÃ©s; Entodon itself being left out of consideration) have a presence share of 49 %. The relations between the Medicagini-Avenetum and <b>chalk</b> <b>grasslands</b> (alliance Mesobromion, class Festuco-Brometea) are discussed. It is stated that while vascular plants characteristic of the Festuco-Brometea do not play a prominent role in the Medicagini-Avenetum, Entodon concinnus constitutes a link between both unities. This is especially true as it is accompanied in some of its stations by Homalothecium lutescens and/or Thuidium abietinum, which occur together with Entodon in <b>chalk</b> <b>grasslands</b> in several parts of Europe. As to the recent discovery of E. concinnus in the Dutch riverine area (apart from one 19 th-century record), the question is asked whether it should be considered a recent arrival. This supposition is denied, because 1) the moss never shows fructification in this part of its area, nor does it produce gemmae, so that anemochorous long-distance dispersal is virtually to be excluded; 2) its stations are hardly ever reached by river water, making dispersal of entire plants unlikely; 3) the Medicagini-Avenetum in which it occurs, has more or less a relic distribution. It is concluded that bryologists did not search in the right habitat and that vegetation investigators (probably overwhelmed by the floweriness of these pastures) have overlooked the moss hitherto...|$|R
40|$|Although {{secondary}} succession {{has been studied}} extensively, we have little knowledge of the succession of soil-borne microbial communities. In this study, we therefore examined the structures of the microbial communities across two separate chronosequences of <b>chalk</b> <b>grasslands</b> in Limburg, the Netherlands, which are {{at different stages of}} {{secondary succession}} after being abandoned for between 17 and < 66 years. Arable fields were also included in the investigation as non-abandoned references. Changes in the soil-borne microbial communities, as determined by phylogenetic microarray and quantitative PCR methodologies, were correlated with the prevailing environmental conditions related to vegetation and soil biochemistry. We observed clear patterns of microbial secondary succession related to soil age, pH and phosphate status, as exemplified by the overrepresentation of Verrucomicrobia, Acidobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, and alpha-, delta-and epsilon-Proteobacteria at late successional stages. Moreover, effects of secondary succession versus changes in soil pH could be resolved, with pH significantly altering the trajectory of microbial succession...|$|R

40|$|Controlling scrub {{encroachment}} is a {{major challenge}} for conservation management on <b>chalk</b> <b>grasslands.</b> However, direct comparisons of scrub removal methods have seldom been investigated, particularly at the landscape scale. Effective monitoring of grassland scrub is problematic as it requires simultaneous information on large scale patterns in scrub cover and fine-scale changes in the grassland community. This study addressed this by combining analysis of aerial imagery with rapid field surveys in order to compare the effectiveness of four scrub management strategies on Defence Training Estate Salisbury Plain, UK. Study plots were sited within areas undergoing management and in unmanaged controls. Controls showed dramatic increases in scrub cover, with encroachment of a mean 1096 m 2 per hectare over ten years. Whilst all management strategies were effective in reducing scrub encroachment, they differed {{in their ability to}} influence regeneration of scrub and grassland quality. There was a general trend, evident in both the floral community and scrub levels, of increased effectiveness with increasing management intensity. The dual methodology proved highly effective, allowing rapid collection of data over a range of variables and spatial scales unavailable to each method individually. The methodology thus demonstrates potential for a useful monitoring tool. ...|$|R
50|$|The North Downs support several {{important}} habitats. The most distinctive {{of these is}} <b>chalk</b> <b>grassland,</b> which is largely limited to steep escarpment and valley slopes. This semi-natural habitat is maintained through sheep, cattle and rabbit grazing which prevents scrub encroachment. <b>Chalk</b> <b>grassland</b> {{to the west of}} the Medway Valley is dominated by upright brome (Bromus erectus) and fescue (Festuca) whilst grassland to the east is dominated by tor-grass (Brachypodium pinnatum). Because of the close proximity of the North Downs to the European continent, the warm climate and the south facing escarpment, several plant species survive on the <b>chalk</b> <b>grassland</b> which are scarce or not found elsewhere in the British Isles.|$|E

40|$|Aims <b>Chalk</b> <b>grasslands</b> {{are subject}} to {{vegetation}} dynamics that range from species-rich open grasslands to tall and encroached grasslands, and woods and forests. In grasslands, earthworms impact plant communities and ecosystem functioning through the modification of soil physical, chemical and microbiological properties, but also through their selective ingestion and vertical transportation of seeds from the soil seed bank. Laboratory experiments showed that seed-earthworm interactions are species specific, but little is known {{on the impact of}} seed-earthworm interactions in the field. The overall aim {{of this study was to}} better understand seed-earthworm interactions and their impact on the plant community. First we analyzed the composition of seedlings emerging from casts after earthworm ingestion. Then we compared seedling composition in casts to the plant composition of emerging seedlings from the soil and of the aboveground vegetation along four stages of the secondary succession of <b>chalk</b> <b>grasslands.</b> Methods Four stages of the secondary succession of a chalk grassland-from open sward to woods-were sampled in Upper Normandy, France, in February 2010. Within each successional stage (x 3 replicates), we sampled the standing vegetation, soil seed bank at three soil depths (0 - 2, 2 - 5 and 5 - 10 cm) and earthworm surface casts along transects. Soil and cast samples were water sieved before samples were spread onto trays and placed into a greenhouse. Emerging seedlings were counted and identified. Effect of successional stage and origin of samples on mean and variability of abundance and species richness of seedlings emerging from casts and soil seed banks were analyzed. Plant compositions were compared between all sample types. We used generalized mixed-effect models and a distance-based redundancy multivariate analysis. Important Findings Seedling abundance was always higher in earthworm casts than in the soil seed bank and increased up to 5 -fold, 4 -fold and 3. 5 -fold, respectively, in the tall grassland, woods and encroached grassland compared to the soil surface layer. Species richness was also higher in earthworm casts than in the soil seed bank in all successional stages, with a 4 -fold increase in the encroached grassland. The plant composition of the standing vegetation was more similar to that of seedlings from casts than to that of seedlings from the soil seed bank. Seedlings diversity emerging from casts in the tall and encroached grasslands tended toward the diversity found in woods. Our results indicate that earthworms may promote the emergence of seedlings. We also suggest that the loss of some plant species in the seed bank and the tall grass vegetation in intermediary successional stages modify the local conditions and prevent the further establishment of early-successional plant species...|$|R
