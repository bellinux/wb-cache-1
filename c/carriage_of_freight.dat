500|$|During {{the time}} the canal was {{administered}} by the Bridgewater Trustees, it made a profit every year. [...] Until his retirement in 1834, the administration was carried out entirely by Bradshaw. It has been calculated that the average annual profit between 1806 and 1826 was {{of the order of}} 13 per cent, and in 1824, the best year, it was 23 per cent. [...] Bradshaw found it difficult to delegate, and complained of being over-worked, but he was also regarded as being a [...] "formidable bargainer". In 1805 he was approached by the proprietors of the nearby Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal to resolve a dispute with a Salford landowner, but his response was delayed. In 1810 there was a general agreement with the Mersey and Irwell Navigation Company (M) to simultaneously raise freight charges. However any cooperation between the two companies was short-lived and by 1812 the Mersey and Irwell had reduced their charges. Further competition was to come from other carriers who used the canal; in 1824 the traffic carried by private companies exceeded that carried by the Trustees for the first time. However, in time more profit came from [...] "tonnage traffic" [...] (that carried by private companies) than from the Bridgewater's own <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>freight.</b> Bradshaw's administration saw increased deterioration of the fabric of the canal, the locks, docks and warehouses. The undertakings were starved of capital largely owing to inadequate provision for it in the duke's will. There were also problems caused by silting around the entrance to the Mersey and by the changing channels of the river itself.|$|E
50|$|At present, Uniform Rules {{created by}} OTIF are {{applicable}} for international carriage by rail on around 250,000 km of railway {{lines and the}} complementary <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> and passengers on 17,000 km of shipping lines and inland waterways, as well as prior or subsequent domestic carriage by road.|$|E
50|$|The railway is single-track, with {{a passing}} loop at Winteregg station, {{and runs to}} a {{terminus}} at Mürren, where the platforms used by passengers are enclosed within a modern station building.

50|$|The {{village was}} the {{location}} for mills producing textiles, snuff, and paper. The Caledonian Railway Company constructed a new spur line connecting Slateford and Balerno in 1874, with a station at Colinton. This line continued to carry passenger traffic until 1943, and finally closed when the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> was discontinued in the 1960s.|$|E
50|$|Passenger and freight {{services}} on the Hagenow Land-Zarrentin section were maintained until 30 April 1969. The line was closed until 27 September 1975 for {{the rehabilitation of}} the track. Passenger traffic was sparse, but it was maintained until {{the turn of the}} millennium, while the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> between Zarrentin and Wittenburg was discontinued on 31 December 1994.|$|E
5000|$|The Dortmund freight bypass railway (Güterumgehungsbahn Dortmund) is {{a railway}} {{line in the}} north of the city of Dortmund in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. It is {{designed}} for the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> only, allowing freight trains that pass through Dortmund to avoid Dortmund Hauptbahnhof, reducing delays to passenger traffic and reducing threat of dangerous accidents in the city centre.|$|E
50|$|The <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> other <b>freight</b> {{and general}} {{merchandise}} {{never met the}} levels the promotors of the line anticipated {{and one or two}} trains per day were sufficient to meet the demand. After the withdrawal of the passenger services in 1935, freight traffic continued until 1964 when the goods facilities at Bradnop, Ipstones and Winkhill were withdrawn.|$|R
50|$|At 31 December 1921, the B&MR {{had issued}} capital of £2.07 million; net income in 1921 of £66,577; {{dividend}} in 1921 on ordinary shares: nil; locomotives {{taken over by}} the GWR: 47; number <b>of</b> passenger <b>carriages</b> 90; number <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> wagons 640; employees 842. Single track mileage was 82miles-44chains en route mileage of 59miles-66 chains.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> rail <b>freight</b> {{has diminished}} since the 1950s. Today, the {{principal}} remaining traffic in Cornwall is china clay from the St Austell area and Goonbarrow on the Newquay line; this traffic is centred on St Blazey depot (which {{is on the}} Newquay branch, close to Par) and the freight-only line from Lostwithiel to Fowey docks where the china clay is loaded on to ships. A small amount of cement is carried to [...] north of Liskeard for road distribution. The docks at Falmouth are also rail connected but see no regular traffic.|$|R
50|$|Because {{of growing}} {{competition}} from road transport for freight, profitability fell {{significantly in the}} 1960s, so that the dual gauge freight line between Heidelberg and Schriesheim was closed in 1970 and in 1971 the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> was abandoned. An exception was the annual sugar beet harvest, which was transported using Rollbocks, which operated until 1983. Otherwise, the OEG operated freight traffic until the early 1990s using road transport.|$|E
50|$|The railway carried {{its highest}} numbers of {{passengers}} during World War II {{and after the}} war the railway was an important method of supplying the region with goods and materials. In 1950, the Tirolean Water Company (TIWAG) acquired a majority of the shares in the railway, passing them to the villages of Achenkirch, Maurach and Eben in 1979. <b>Carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> ceased in 1973. The railway was remodelled with support from TIWAG, the Federal Government and State Government.|$|E
5000|$|Rendsburg {{station is}} located in the city of Rendsburg in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein and is at the {{junction}} of the Neumünster-Flensburg and Rendsburg Kiel lines. It is currently operated by Deutsche Bahn, which classifies it as a category 4 station. There used to be a direct line from Rendsburg to Husum via Erfde, as distinct from the current route via Jübek. A short section of the Erfde line is still used for the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>freight.</b>|$|E
30|$|Research into current methods <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> {{distribution}} in urban centres was considered when developing designs for a metro <b>carriage</b> capable <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> transport. There were three design scenarios to be explored. The first being {{a design that}} utilised the current metro interior, requiring very low investment and could work as a short-term option. The second scenario was to design a reconfigurable carriage that {{would be able to}} provide freight and passenger services alongside one another, and will possess adaptable seating to free up space within the carriage. The final scenario was to design a fully automated freight system that operated using the metro system. Various designs were considered before the final designs were chosen.|$|R
50|$|During 1942, {{an order}} for 14 transport-orientated Warwicks, {{designated}} as the Warwick C.Mk.I and Vickers 456, was made for the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), a civil operator. The prescribed operational requirements were the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> mail, <b>freight,</b> and passengers (in order of priority) between Bathurst in South Africa and Cairo in Egypt, complementing BOAC's flying boat operations between England and Bathurst. The order was quickly met by converting existing B.Mk.I Warwicks, removing all military equipment, fairing over gun turret positions, along with the installation of cabin windows, a freight floor, long-range fuel tanks, and exhaust stack flame dampers (for night flights).|$|R
50|$|COTIF was {{modified}} by a Protocol that {{was signed in}} Vilnius on 3 June 1999. Prior to the Vilnius Protocol, the principal objective of OTIF was to develop uniform systems of law which could apply to the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> passengers and <b>freight</b> in international rail traffic. These systems of law have been in existence for decades and are known as the CIV (for passengers) and CIM (for freight/goods) Uniform Rules.|$|R
50|$|The Kronberg Railway Company (Cronberger Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, {{using the}} old {{spelling}} of Kronberg) opened its 9.8 km-long line from Rödelheim for passengers on 1 November 1874. The <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>freight,</b> which was never great, followed on 1 March 1875. The Prussian government had granted a concession for {{the line on}} 26 June 1872. The purpose of the line was to serve the then already strong tourist traffic from Frankfurt to the Anterior Taunus (Vordertaunus, the now suburbanised foothills of the Taunus near Frankfurt). Already numerous wealthy citizens of Frankfurt had established their residence (or second residence) there, leading to steadily growing commuter traffic. Soon through trains began running from Frankfurt to Kronberg.|$|E
50|$|On 1 June 1994, {{the last}} {{remaining}} pair of trains ran on the Bielefeld-Bassum-Bremen route and therefore all passenger traffic ended between Rahden and Bassum. The <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> ended on 3 June 1994, except on the Sulingen-Barenburg section. DB Schenker Rail Deutschland has continued to operate traffic on {{the section of the}} line from Diepholz via Sulingen to Barenburg for ExxonMobil. There are plans to create a connecting curve at Sulingen between the lines to Diepholz and Barenburg, providing a bypass of Sulingen. The grounds of the disused Sulinger station with its formerly extensive track systems would be redeveloped. The remaining line was closed on 31 December 1997.|$|E
5000|$|In October 1988, the Victorian Minister for Transport {{proposed}} a [...] "Fast Freight Train". It was partly {{a response to}} the VFT proposal, which would not have been suitable for the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> due to the steeper grades proposed. The FFT {{proposed a}} major upgrade of the existing alignment between Sydney and Melbourne, comprising several bridge replacements and minor deviations between Albury and Melbourne, and much more extensive works between Moss Vale and Junee. The proposed alignment would allow freight trains to travel at a top speed of 115 km/h for most of the route, with no speed restrictions for curves or hills.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{important}} concession by the Government {{designed to}} improve the competitiveness of the [...] "Second Force" [...] was to permit it to provide a first class cabin on its East African routes. (BUA, from whom BCal inherited these routes, had been prevented from offering a first class on its East African routes. To compensate for this loss of competitiveness, Sir Freddie Laker, BUA's managing director from 1960 to 1965, {{had come up with}} the idea of designing a cargo door to be installed on the left-hand side of the forward fuselage of that airline's long-haul VC10s, where the first class cabin was normally located. This modification permitted the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> additional <b>freight</b> instead <b>of</b> first class passengers on the East African routes.) ...|$|R

To compensate for {{this loss of}} competitiveness, Freddie Laker {{came up with the}} novel idea of designing a cargo door to be installed on the left-hand side of the forward fuselage of the airline's VC10s, where the first class cabin was normally located. This modification permitted the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> additional <b>freight</b> instead <b>of</b> first class passengers on the East African routes. BUA's VC10s also had extended wingtips that were slightly bent downwards to reduce the aircraft's cruise drag and to help it overcome the instability encountered when entering a stall, as well as an intermediate, 14-degree flap setting to enable all-year round, nonstop flights from the then relatively short runway at Nairobi's hot-and-high Embakasi Airport to Gatwick with a full payload and reserves.|$|R
50|$|Air {{transport}} in the United Kingdom is {{the commercial}} <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> passengers, <b>freight</b> and mail by aircraft, {{both within the}} United Kingdom (UK) and between the UK {{and the rest of}} the world. In the past 25 years the industry has seen continuous growth, and the demand for passenger air travel in particular is forecast to increase from the current level of 236 million passengers to 465 million in 2030. One airport, London Heathrow Airport, is amongst the top ten busiest airports in the world. More than half of all passengers travelling by air in the UK currently travel via the five London area airports. Outside of London, Manchester Airport is by far the largest and busiest of the remaining airports, acting as a hub for the 20 million or so people who live within a two-hour drive. Regional airports have experienced the most growth in recent years, due to the success of 'no-frills' airlines over the last decade.|$|R
50|$|Lindau is the {{terminus}} of the Allgäu Railway, {{running from}} Munich via Kempten. Its southeastern section from Oberstaufen to Lindau was completed on 1 September 1853. From 1869 to 1939 {{there was a}} ferry port for the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> wagons to Romanshorn and from 1873 to 1899 to Konstanz. In 1899, the Bodenseegürtel Railway was opened from Radolfzell via Friedrichshafen. The Vorarlberg Railway runs from Lindau via Bregenz, Dornbirn and Feldkirch to Bludenz and is operated by the Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB). As a result, Lindau is also a border station. Formerly the ÖBB had its own ticket office in Lindau station; this was replaced by ticket machines, which still exist.|$|E
50|$|The {{transport}} of freight was abandoned between Eschwege and Schwebda on 1 October 1994 and between Eschwege and Eschwege West on 15 December 2002. The <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> and passengers between Homberg and Oberbeisheim ended in 1981. Services closed between Malsfeld and Oberbeisheim on 31 December 1988. On 31 May 1986 freight services ended between Pfieffe and Spangenberg on 1 September 1994 freight services closed from Malsfeld. At that time, the southern curve at Malsfeld was used for operations at {{this time as the}} northern curve had been shut down earlier. Daily freight service ran between Homberg and Treysa until 25 June 2002. Freight trains could operate between Eschwege West and Waldkappel until 31 December 1991.|$|E
50|$|The Bristol Type 170 Freighter was a twin-engine, {{high-mounted}} wing monoplane {{that was}} developed specifically {{for the purpose of}} the economic <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> by air. It was a visually distinctive aircraft, possessing a 'boxy' fuselage, rounded nose, and a high-set flight deck. In order to maximise the economical performance of the Freighter, compromises were implemented on other aspects of performance, resulting in a relatively low cruising speed; this was not viewed as being of importance to the role of a freighter and thus not a major diminishing factor. According to aviation publication Flight, the economics of the Freighter were judged to be a major factor of its market appeal, as well as the wider economic situation of the United Kingdom at this time.|$|E
25|$|In January 1965, Lloyd International {{decided to}} acquire two Bristol Britannia 312 {{turboprops}} from British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) {{and to have}} them fitted with special doors and stronger floors to allow the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> large-size palletised <b>freight</b> consignments. The first aircraft joined the fleet in April of that year. Aviation Traders won the contract to convert the Britannias into freighters. This involved fitting the aircraft with large forward cargo doors and strengthening the cabin floors. Conversion began during the 1965/6 winter season. This enabled the company to concentrate on long-haul charters, especially between Europe and the Far East. While these aircraft were primarily intended for freight operations, they were also used to transport passengers.|$|R
50|$|The most {{significant}} change made under the Terra Transport subsidiary was {{the move to}} the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> less-than-carload (LCL) <b>freight.</b> A large fleet of distinctive green intermodal shipping containers were ordered and used in place of boxcars. These containers could be stacked on flatcars of mainland trains, fitted onto the decks inside the ferries, and then placed on flatcars of trains in Newfoundland or transported entirely by truck. During the mid-1980s, trains composed almost entirely of the distinctive TT containers were common. The handling time for freight dropped considerably, as containers could be easily removed from the trains in each community and the loading/unloading at Port aux Basques was significantly improved over standard freight cars. Another significant change the closure and abandonment all of CN's branch lines in the province by 1984, leaving only the main line operational.|$|R

50|$|A {{passenger}} ship is a merchant ship whose primary {{function is to}} carry passengers on the sea. The category does not include cargo vessels which have accommodations for limited numbers of passengers, such as the ubiquitous twelve-passenger freighters once common on the seas in which the transport of passengers is secondary to the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>freight.</b> The type does however include many classes of ships designed to transport substantial numbers of passengers as well as freight. Indeed, until recently virtually all ocean liners were able to transport mail, package freight and express, and other cargo in addition to passenger luggage, and were equipped with cargo holds and derricks, kingposts, or other cargo-handling gear for that purpose. Only in more recent ocean liners and in virtually all cruise ships has this cargo capacity been eliminated.|$|E
50|$|The Erms Valley Railway {{was opened}} on 27 December 1873 {{as a private}} railway by the Ermsthalbahn-Gesellschaft ("Erms Valley Railway Company").

On 2 August 1919, the line was extended by 1.194 km to Kunstmühle Künkele. Although this extension was only for the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> to the mill, provision was made {{for the construction of}} an envisaged extension towards Münsingen, which would have created a link to the Reutlingen-Schelklingen railway.

50|$|In 1964, Brian Lloyd, {{one of the}} airline's founders, {{sold out}} while {{well-established}} Far East trading company Wheelock Marden bought into the company by acquiring a 33% stake in the business. The latter transaction put Wheelock Marden's sales offices in Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Tokyo at the airline's disposal. The same year, Lloyd International acquired its first Douglas DC-6 (an A/B series model), the airline's first pressurised aircraft. This was also the year the airline's operating base moved from Cambridge to Gatwick.In January 1965, Lloyd International decided to acquire two Bristol Britannia 312 turboprops from British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and to have them fitted with special doors and stronger floors to allow the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> large-size palletised <b>freight</b> consignments.

50|$|To {{improve the}} {{efficiency}} of train working, Train Controllers (also known as Controllers, District Controllers, Line Controllers and Area Controllers) were progressively introduced on many British-style railways {{in the early years}} of the 20th century, the first being on the Midland Railway in 1907. Although the specifics of their duties varied between railways, Train Controllers were responsible for tracking train movements (especially freight), ensuring freight trains were loaded economically and provided with suitable locomotive power, liaising with train crew rostering personnel, ordering additional trains to run for the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> extra <b>freight</b> tonnage or passengers as required, allocating paths for unscheduled services and making alterations to scheduled working in order to maximize efficiency and deal with any irregularity in traffic which may affect smooth operation. On busy railways such as the Midland, it was at times very difficult for Signalmen to keep track of train movements and make optimal traffic regulation decisions whilst operating signalling equipment. Consequently, fast trains could be delayed by slower trains on the line ahead. Moreover, there was no-one with specific responsibilities relating to the efficient, economical use of rolling stock in traffic, which made it difficult to manage the contingencies of underutilisation, wastage and allocation of inappropriate locomotive power. In the face of rising costs, operating economies were particularly important to the private British railway companies in the early twentieth century. The Train Controller was intended to manage these and other difficulties. It is important to note that while Train Controllers were responsible for traffic regulation within their areas of control, they generally had no safety-critical responsibilities, which were within the realm of the Signalmen and Station Masters.|$|R
