Therefore, the research which finds the most accurate and economical way {{to solve the problem}} faced by Morocco and the analysis of field application are highly needed. So, Korea <b>Cadastral</b> <b>Survey</b> Corporation(KCSC) which is the biggest survey company in South Korea implemented of the program to establish the methodology of land registration in Morocco. Within the context of this implementation, Korean human resources, technology, and advanced system can take an effect on land administrative environment to be more improved in Morocco. The objectives of the program are to A. Enhance the <b>cadastral</b> <b>surveying</b> and management technology by sharing Korean know-how and technology. B.

40|$|New Zealand {{currently}} has a world-class property rights system that underpins {{the delivery of}} social, economic, and cultural benefits. This system comprises a land tenure system to provide certainty about property rights and a supporting <b>cadastral</b> <b>survey</b> system to provide certainty about the spatial extent of those rights. However, there is an increasing concern that New Zealand’s property rights system will not continue to be optimal in the future. A significant contributing factor to this concern is {{the inability of the}} <b>cadastral</b> <b>survey</b> system to handle three-dimensional (3 D) information defining the spatial extents of property rights in a digital environment. The development of 3 D <b>cadastral</b> <b>survey</b> systems {{is the subject of a}} substantial body of international research and discussion. Despite this, no country in the world has successfully implemented a fully functioning 3 D digital <b>cadastral</b> <b>survey</b> system. Also, while New Zealand has an interest in developing a 3 D digital <b>cadastral</b> <b>survey</b> system, there is no substantive local research on the matter. The research undertaken as part of this thesis will contribute to the literature by providing a New Zealand perspective on developing such a system and will also feed into the development of New Zealand’s <b>cadastral</b> <b>survey</b> system. This research explores New Zealand’s current <b>cadastral</b> <b>survey</b> system and considers the motivation for its enhancement. The literature supporting international research and development is evaluated to determine the characteristics, opportunities, issues and approaches associated with developing a <b>cadastral</b> <b>survey</b> system with 3 D digital capabilities. A preferred approach to a 3 D digital <b>cadastral</b> <b>survey</b> system is established and then developed at a conceptual level after it was found that an internationally standardised approach was inadequate...|$|R

50|$|The Public Lands Survey System is a <b>cadastral</b> <b>survey</b> of the United States {{originating}} in legislation from 1785, after international {{recognition of the}} United States. The Dominion Land Survey is a similar <b>cadastral</b> <b>survey</b> conducted in Western Canada begun in 1871 after {{the creation of the}} Dominion of Canada in 1867. Both <b>cadastral</b> <b>surveys</b> are made relative to principal meridian and baselines. These <b>cadastral</b> <b>surveys</b> divided the surveyed areas into townships, square land areas of approximately 36 square miles (six miles by six miles; some very early surveys in Ohio created 25 square mile townships when the design of the system was being explored). These townships are divided into sections, each approximately one-mile square. Unlike in Europe this <b>cadastral</b> <b>survey</b> largely preceded settlement and as a result greatly influenced settlement patterns. Properties are generally rectangular, boundary lines often run on cardinal bearings, and parcel dimensions are often in fractions or multiples of chains. Land descriptions in Western North America are principally based on these land surveys.|$|R

As {{the result of this}} study, the current process may be shortened considerably to create new profit when the new communication technology is applied. Therefore, for such profit creation, the process improvement solution for the field of cadastral application of communication system used with total station, GPS operation software, Network-GPS, Ntrip, Wibro and Zig-bee, among the applicable solutions for <b>cadastral</b> <b>surveying</b> field with the recently used latest communication technology.

As the wireless internet based Wibro communication is applied for this working processor, the mutual processing could be applied with wireless internet. As the software was developed for the <b>cadastral</b> <b>surveying</b> processor improvement, the geo-coding was improved and the working phases of field <b>cadastral</b> <b>surveying</b> work, and above all, various reasons for difference could be decreased...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the investigation of}} UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) for use in <b>cadastral</b> <b>surveying.</b> Within the scope of a pilot study UAVs were tested for capturing geodata and compared with conventional data acquisition methods for <b>cadastral</b> <b>surveying.</b> Two study sites were therefore surveyed with a tachymeter-GNSS combination {{as well as a}} UAV system. The workflows of both methods were investigated and the resulting data were compared with the requirements of Swiss <b>cadastral</b> <b>surveying.</b> Concerning data acquisition and evaluation, the two systems are found to be comparable in terms of time expenditure, accuracy, and completeness. In conclusion, the UAV image orientation proved to be the limiting factor for the obtained accuracy due to the low- cost camera including camera calibration, image quality, and definition of the ground control points (natural or artificial). However, the required level of accuracy for <b>cadastral</b> <b>surveying</b> was reached. The advantage of UAV systems lies in their high flexibility and efficiency in capturing the surface of an area from a low flight altitude. In addition, further information such as orthoimages, elevation models and 3 D objects can easily be gained from UAV images. Altogether, this project endorses the benefit of using UAVs in cadastral applications and the new opportunities they provide for <b>cadastral</b> <b>surveying...</b>|$|R

The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to describe the Australian Cadastral System with an emphasis on <b>cadastral</b> <b>surveying</b> and mapping and the role of the professional land surveyor. First an overview of the Australian land market is presented, followed by a discussion of the difference between European cadastres and cadastral systems developed under English Common Law. Next the historical development and current status of both the Torrens System of title registration and the <b>cadastral</b> <b>surveying</b> system is given. The trend for Australian cadastral systems to move from <b>cadastral</b> <b>surveying</b> of individual parcels to an integrated cadastral mapping system is highlighted together with the development of the associated digital cadastral databases. The paper describes the professional qualifications required of a land surveyor as well as the institutions supporting the survey system. The relationship of the cadastral system to the development of state-wide land information systems is discussed. The paper concludes by highlighting future trends in the Australian cadastral system. 1 July 1994 Open Acces...|$|R
