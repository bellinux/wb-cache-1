40|$|The {{partnership}} between the Fe´deration Dentaire International (FDI), and Unilever Oral Care, aims {{to raise awareness of}} oral health globally; to enable FDI member associations to promote oral health; and to increase the visibility of the FDI and authority of Unilever oral care brands worldwide. <b>Country</b> <b>Projects</b> between National Dental Associations (NDAs), the member associations of FDI, and Unilever Oral Care local companies have been established as a key strand of the partnership. Aim: This paper reports on the evaluation of an in-depth sample of <b>Country</b> <b>Projects</b> (n = 5) to determine their potential to impact on oral health. Method: Five country sites were selected as being indicative of different programme delivery types. Each site received a two-day visit during Spring-Summer 2009, which enabled the evaluators to audit what was delivered in practice compared with the original written project briefs and to undertake interviews of study site staff. Results: 39 <b>projects</b> in 36 <b>countries</b> have been initiated. In those examined by site visits, clear evidence was found of capacity building to deliver oral health. In some countries, widespread population reach had been prioritised. Effectiveness of partnership working varied depending on the strength {{of the relationship between the}} NDA and local Unilever Oral Care representatives and alignment with national marketing strategy. The quality of internal evaluation varied considerably. Conclusions: Over a million people had been reached directly by <b>Country</b> <b>Projects</b> and this public private partnership has made a successful start. To move towards improving oral health rather than only awareness raising; future <b>Country</b> <b>Projects</b> would benefit from being limited to certain evidence-based intervention designs, and using an agreed core indicator set in order to allow cross-country comparison of intervention outcomes...|$|R
