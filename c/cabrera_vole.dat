40|$|In this study, {{the habitat}} {{use by the}} {{threatened}} <b>Cabrera</b> <b>vole,</b> Microtus cabrerae, was assessed in an agricultural landscape of SW Portugal,in order to evaluate agricultural management practices that might favour its populations. Despite the patchy distribution and the sensitivity in relation to human management, average colony size was 1928 m 2, and mean nearest neighbour distance was 363 m. Within the selected habitats, the Cabrera vole’s activity was concentrated in sites with dense and tall herbs, though appearing to avoid areas where southern water voles, Arvicola sapidus, were present. Activity of Cabrera voles was higher during the winter, confirming the adverse effect of the dry periods for this species. Conservation of the <b>Cabrera</b> <b>vole</b> in agricultural landscapes would require {{the maintenance of a}} network of tall and dense herbaceous patches, which could possibly be established along field margins, road verges, and ditches, and supported by agri-environment subsidy schemes...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Cabrera</b> <b>vole</b> (Microtus cabrerae) is a {{threatened}} rodent endemic in the Iberian Peninsula with a patchy distribution and specific microhabitat requirements. This {{aim of this}} study was to document the composition of plant communities in habitats of <b>Cabrera</b> <b>vole</b> colonies in southern Portugal. Differences observed in plant species composition were also compared with vegetation structure, taxonomic and life form groups, species and group diversity, disturbance, topography and soil properties. Vegetation was sampled between March and July 2004, in 26 colonies occurring in five geographical areas. Grasses were the most abundant, common and diverse family in the colonies, and the perennial grass Agrostis castellana was present in 92 % of colonies, with a mean cover of 16 % of the site. Other frequently occurring species were Briza maxima (85 %), Vulpia myuros (85 %), Gaudinia fragilis (81 %), Leontodon spp. (81 %), Avena barbata (77 %), Bromus hordeaceus (77 %) and Tolpis barbata (77 %). Colonies were classified in eight vegetation groups that included meadows, tall perennial grasslands, manured meadows with tall sedges, annual grasslands and ruderal and nitrophilous grasslands. Main gradients associated with composition differences were grass richness, annual and perennial grass cover, vegetation structure (herbaceous vegetation height), soil properties (texture and moisture), disturbance (ruderal species) and colony dimensions (area). Results suggest that the <b>Cabrera</b> <b>vole</b> is able to exploit a wide variety of grasslands, with a varying degree of ecological disturbance.

40|$|Although {{environmental}} conditions and biotic interactions are {{widely recognized as}} key sources of variation in circadian activity rhythms of {{a broad array of}} vertebrates, information on their actual signi ﬁ cance outside experimental settings remains scarce. We investigated changes in circadian activity rhythms of free-ranging <b>Cabrera</b> <b>voles,</b> Microtus <b>cabrerae,</b> and water <b>voles,</b> Arvicola sapidus, in highly seasonal Mediterranean environments, and analysed how such changes were further affected by inter-sexual and interspeciﬁc interactions. <b>Cabrera</b> <b>voles</b> were largely diurnal, with a unimodal peak around midday during the wet season, whereas during the dry season activity was reduced during the hot midday period and increased strongly at dawn and dusk. Water voles also had a marked bimodal crepuscular pattern during the dry season, but this was much attenuated during the wet season, when they were comparatively more diurnal. Activity patterns varied little between the sexes, although with a tendency for higher overall activity by male <b>Cabrera</b> <b>voles</b> (dry season only) and water voles, possibly because of intersexual interactions involving seasonal shifts from monogamy to facultative polygyny in <b>Cabrera</b> <b>voles,</b> and year-round polygyny in water vole. Within each season, <b>Cabrera</b> <b>voles</b> appeared to change their activity patterns in the presence of water voles, reducing overall activity and shifting activity peaks towards diurnal (dry season) or crepuscular (wet season) time periods less used by water voles. Overall, this study provides evidence for the strong role of seasonal changes in {{environmental conditions}} and interspeciﬁc interactions in driving variation in the activity patterns of Mediterranean voles under natural conditions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The <b>Cabrera</b> <b>vole</b> is an {{endangered}} species frequently found in the montado, a savannah-like ecosystem well adapted to fire. Although {{it is assumed that}} regular burning is not very prejudicial to this vole, the impact of fire is unknown. This research studied, for the first time, recolonisation by the <b>Cabrera</b> <b>vole</b> after wildfire. Colonies were monitored over one year after a wildfire and the most relevant ecological features in their reestablishment were identified. During the first eight months, all the 18 surveyed colonies remained unoccupied. However, after one year, 11 were recolonised. Vegetation structure and composition in the colonies (vegetation height, plant families diversity, percentage of bare ground and cover of shrubs before the fire), which are important features in offering protection and nutrition, were closely related to reoccupation of the colonies. Surprisingly, fire intensity did not influence recolonisation. Distance from unburned areas proved to be a factor that delayed recolonisation. The importance of the montado for this species was reinforced by the evidence that recolonisation occurred preferentially in colonies surrounded by this habitat type...|$|E

40|$|Glacial refugia {{protected}} and promoted biodiversity during the Pleistocene, {{not only at}} a broader scale, but also for many endemics that contracted and expanded their ranges within refugial areas. Understanding the evolutionary history of refugial endemics is especially important {{in the case of}} endangered species to recognize the origins of their genetic structure and thus produce better informed conservation practices. The Iberian Peninsula is an important European glacial refugium, rich in endemics of conservation concern, including small mammals, such as the <b>Cabrera</b> <b>vole</b> (Microtus cabrerae). This near-threatened rodent is characterized by an unusual suite of genetic, life history and ecological traits, being restricted to isolated geographic nuclei in fast-disappearing Mediterranean subhumid herbaceous habitats. To reconstruct the evolutionary history of the <b>Cabrera</b> <b>vole,</b> we studied sequence variation at mitochondrial, autosomal and sex-linked loci, using invasive and noninvasive samples. Despite low overall mitochondrial and nuclear nucleotide diversities, we observed two main well-supported mitochondrial lineages, west and east. Phylogeographic modelling {{in the context of the}} Cabrera vole's detailed fossil record supports a demographic scenario of isolation of two populations during the Last Glacial Maximum from a single focus in the southern part of the Iberian Peninsula. In addition, our data suggest subsequent divergence within the east, and secondary contact and introgression of the expanding western population, during the late Holocene. This work emphasizes that refugial endemics may have a phylogeographic history as rich as that of more widespread species, and conservation of such endemics includes the preservation of that genetic legacy.

40|$|The <b>Cabrera</b> <b>vole</b> (Microtus cabrerae) {{is a rare}} rodent {{living in}} patchy grassy areas of the Iberian Peninsula where {{unpaired}} individuals of both sexes use scent marking primarily to increase their mate-finding likelihood. Cabrera voles establish long-term pair bonds with opposite-sex conspecifics constituting a breeding pair, {{which is expected to}} reduce the efforts in searching for a new mate. Under such circumstances, scent marking as a strategy to increase mate finding likelihood became useless. Accordingly, we hypothesize that pair bonded Cabrera voles suppress mate finding scent marking to reduce energetic costs and predation risk. To test this hypothesis, we compared scent-marking behaviour towards a clean substrate, in both paired and nonpaired voles. No differences were found in the scent marks’type and the amount of marks placed by voles in both conditions. We also analysed the scent-marking behaviour of both sex pair bonded voles when exposed simultaneously to a clean substrate, a substrate pre-marked by males and a substrate pre-marked by females. We found no significant differences in scent-marks (urine-marked area and number of faecal boli) across the three types of substrate types. In accordance with our prediction, these results suggest that pair bonded Cabrera voles did not use scent marking for mate finding, thus providing further support to the existence of a monogamous mating strategy. Furthermore, our results fail to support the use of scent marking for territorial defense purposes...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSpatial {{segregation}} {{is one of}} {{the common}} mechanisms allowing the co-existence of similar interacting species in heterogeneous environments. Analysing spatial segregation requires information on individual home-range sizes and their degree of spatial overlap. In this study, we used radio-tracking to report {{for the first time the}} home-range and core-area sizes of sympatric <b>Cabrera</b> and water <b>voles</b> and to analyse intra- and inter-specific space sharing within habitat patches in a highly fragmented landscape. Results indicated that both species exhibited strong fine-scale site fidelity and reduced variation in range size across sexes and seasons. Monogamous mating system seemed to prevail for both species, although water voles may also exhibit polygynous breeding strategies. Mean home-range and core-area sizes of water voles (946. 3 and 156. 6  m) were about twice that of <b>Cabrera</b> <b>voles</b> (418. 2 and 55. 1  m). Within habitat patches, individuals of both species often overlapped their home ranges, particularly during the dry season (May–September), though intra-specific home-range overlap was generally higher than inter-specific overlap. Inter-specific space sharing was restricted to areas outside the centre of activity of animals, as no core-area overlap was ever recorded between <b>Cabrera</b> and water <b>voles.</b> Taken together, results support the view that co-existence of <b>Cabrera</b> and water <b>voles</b> in Mediterranean patchy habitats may in part result from spatial segregation among individuals, which may reflect competitive displacement or small-scale habitat partitioning. Results highlight the need to account for species interactions when designing conservation management strategies for sympatric <b>Cabrera</b> and water <b>voles</b> in fragmented landscapes...|$|R
40|$|The alarm pheromones often {{released}} by animals under stressful situations seem to elicit behavioral changes in conspecifics, {{which in the}} appropriate context {{can be viewed as}} anti-predatory responses. However, the releasing of alarm pheromones associated with predatory events has not been demonstrated in mammals. In the current study with wild-caught <b>Cabrera</b> <b>voles,</b> we carried out experiments in the laboratory and in the field to assess the release of alarm pheromones in scent-marks during simulated predatory events and disclose their effects on conspecifics. We first conducted an assay wherein voles where let to scent-mark a clean substrate in the absence of disturbance (control) and under the simulation of predatory events. Contrarily to the control, no fecal boli were released and the area marked with urine was significantly larger during the predatory simulation. In a subsequent assay, we assessed the voles' preference between urine-marks released under predatory simulation and in control conditions. Voles showed a significant preference by control substrates. Finally, a third assay was carried out in the vole's habitat wherein the individual activity was monitored by radio-tracking before and after placement of urine-marks obtained during the conditions described above. The vole's activity was only reduced near the urine-marks released during the simulated predatory events. The results suggest that: (1) during predatory attempts, <b>Cabrera</b> <b>voles</b> release an alarm pheromone in their urine-marks; (2) the putative alarm pheromone reduces the voles' activity in the surroundings of the marked area; (3) the putative alarm pheromone persists in the field affecting conspecifics' activity for several days...|$|R

40|$|Although the {{importance}} of spatial scale for understanding habitat selection patterns and processes has long been recognized, {{little is known about}} its impact on the identiﬁcation of habitat differentiation between sympatric species, despite its likely utility in assessing niche partitioning and thus explaining species coexistence. Here we used radio-telemetry data to examine seasonal habitat selection and differentiation by Cabrera (n = 28) and water voles (n = 29) within habitat patches in a highly fragmented landscape, across spatial extents and resolutions. Habitat selection was found for both species at the home-range and core-area scales, tending to be strongest for water and Cabrera voles at coarse and ﬁne spatial resolutions, respectively. Water voles showed higher preference for humid sedge/rush and reed habitats across seasons and spatial scales. Cabrera voles consistently selected tall grass and shrub habitats during the wet season, whereas dry season preference was higher for sedge/rush and tall grass at ﬁne and coarse spatial resolutions, respectively. Niche overlap was highest during the dry season,lowest at the core-area scale, and increased with spatial resolution. These patterns likely reﬂected the ﬁne-scale, seasonal habitat preferences of the <b>Cabrera</b> <b>vole,</b> which during the dry season increased the use of small sedge/rush patches embedded in larger tall grass meadows, thereby bringing it in closer contact to the humid habitats selected at coarse spatial resolutions by the water vole throughout the year.

40|$|According to {{ecological}} theory, the {{coexistence of}} competitors in patchy environments may be facilitated by hierarchical spatial segregation along axes of environmental variation, but empirical evidence is limited. Cabrera and water voles show a metapopulation-like structure in Mediterranean farmland, {{where they are}} known to segregate along space, habitat, and time axes within habitat patches. Here, we assess whether segregation also occurs among and within landscapes, and how this is influenced by patch-network and matrix composition. We surveyed 75 landscapes, each covering 78 ha, where we mapped all habitat patches potentially suitable for Cabrera and water voles, and the area effectively occupied by each species (extent of occupancy). The relatively large water vole tended to be the sole occupant of landscapes with high habitat amount but relatively low patch density (i. e., with a few large patches), and with a predominantly agricultural matrix, whereas landscapes with high patch density (i. e.,many small patches) and low agricultural cover, tended to be occupied exclusively by the small <b>Cabrera</b> <b>vole.</b> The two species tended to co-occur in landscapes with intermediate patch-network and matrix characteristics, though their extents of occurrence were negatively correlated after controlling for environmental effects. In combination with our previous studies on the Cabrera-water vole system, these findings illustrated empirically the occurrence of hierarchical spatial segregation, ranging from withinpatches to among-landscapes. Overall, our study suggests that recognizing the hierarchical nature of spatial segregation patterns and their major environmental drivers should enhance our understanding of species coexistence in patchy environments...|$|E
40|$|There is {{mounting}} evidence that both patch networks and the intervening matrix influence species persistence in fragmented landscapes, though {{the relative importance}} of each of these factors in determining spatial population structure remains poorly understood. This study examined this issue using a three-year data set on the distribution of Cabrera voles (Microtus cabrerae) in Mediterranean farmland. The spatial pattern appeared consistent with a metapopulation structure, as voles occupied discrete tall herb patches scattered across the agricultural landscape, where local extinctions and colonizations induced temporal changes in occupancy patterns. Patch dynamics determined deviations from classical metapopulation assumptions, with over half the extinctions resulting from agricultural disturbance or vegetation succession, and recolonizations often occurring after the recovery of suitable habitat conditions sometime after disturbance. Occupancy in undisturbed patches was more stable, with vole occurrence in one year strongly reflecting that in the previous year. Overall, occupancy increased with both patch size and connectivity, but the unique contribution of patch variables to explain variation in vole occurrence was far smaller than that of matrix attributes. Voles occurred more often in patches surrounded by natural pastures, while prevalence declined with increasing cover by shrubland, pine plantations, improved pastures and grazed cropland. It is hypothesised that unfavourable land uses may increase the effective isolation of habitat patches through increased predation risk of dispersing voles. Conservation of the <b>Cabrera</b> <b>vole</b> in Mediterranean farmland should thus strive to maintain lightly grazed fields surrounding well-connected networks of suitable habitat patches...|$|E
40|$|Arvicolid {{mitochondrial}} genomes evolve {{faster than}} in any other mammalian lineage. The genetic diversity exhibited by these rodents contrasts sharply with their phenotypic homogeneity. Furthermore, faecal droppings from Arvicolid rodents of similar body size are almost undistinguishable on the basis of pellet morphology and content. In this study, we advan- taged from their high genetic diversity vs. phenotypic homogeneity to document the applicability of mtDNA extraction from vole droppings for latter identification of such via a rapid and efficient nested PCR-based technique using the threa- tened Microtus cabrerae as a model species.

40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to update the {{distribution}} of the <b>Cabrera</b> <b>vole</b> (Microtus cabrerae) in Portugal in order to determine regions of suitable environmental conditions and to assess potential occurrence areas, as a first step towards a conservation strategy for the species. Data on the distribution of the species was derived from barn owl pellet samples. Climatic, topographic and soil descriptors were selected and logistic regression was used to model the species distribution. The effort in data collection resulted in the enlargement of the previously known distribution of M. cabrerae. Two logistic models were developed, one environmental and one autologistic, integrating variation due to spatial autocorrelation. The results showed that the species are more likely to occur over the most central region of Portugal, extending its range to the north-eastern side and to the southwest. The preferred areas of occurrence are characterized by medium rainfall values (between 600 and 1200 mm), low to medium humidity values (lower than 85 %) and acid to neutral soils (pH between 3 and 7). Species probability of occurrence is discussed in terms of paleontological data and geographical barriers. Potential distribution maps suggest a fragmentation of the overall national population and allowed the identification of three major areas of high probability of occurrence: northeast, center and southwest. As most of these areas are outside Classified Areas Network, models obtained may be regarded as valuable tools in conservation planning...|$|E
40|$|Rodent scent-marking {{is often}} used for {{territorial}} defence and self-advertisement, and both functions often entail the continuous scent-marking of a large area with high costs. In species with highly-fragmented populations and low density, in which the likelihood of social encounters is low, the costs of continuous scent-marking might exceed the associated fitness benefits; therefore, less intensive scent-marking only to signal presence to the opposite sex may be used. This hypothesis was tested in captivity with the <b>Cabrera</b> <b>vole,</b> a species with highly fragmented and low-density populations. Firstly, to assess the unknown scent-marking behaviour of the Cabrera voles, we conducted an assay wherein voles could scent-mark a clean substrate. Both sexes marked with urine and faeces, but never with anogenital secretions, {{and the amount of}} scent-marks was not different between sexes. In the subsequent assay, voles of each sex were given the choice of scent-mark on clean substrates or on substrates previously scent-marked by males or females. Both sexes marked with urine a larger area on substrates pre-marked by the opposite sex than on substrates pre-marked by the same-sex and clean substrates; however, no differences were found in the frequency of fecal boli deposited on the three types of substrate, and no anogenital secretions were found. The clear preference of receivers to scent-mark with urine the substrate pre-marked by the opposite sex strongly suggests that Cabrera voles use urine scent-marking for inter-sexual communication, probably to increase mate-finding likelihood, rather than for territorial defense and/or self-advertisement...|$|E
40|$|Forecasting species range shifts under {{climate change}} is {{critical}} to adapt conservation strategies to future environmental conditions. Ecological niche models (ENMs) are often used to achieve this goal, but their accuracy is limited when species niches are inadequately sampled. This problem may be tackled by combining ENM with field validation to fine-tune current species distribution, though the traditional methods are often time-consuming and the species ID inaccurate. Here we combine ENM with novel field validation methods based on non-invasive genetic sampling to forecast range shifts in the globally near-threatened <b>Cabrera</b> <b>vole</b> (Microtus cabrerae). Using occurrence records mapped at 10 km × 10 km resolution, we built the first ENM (ENM 1) to estimate the current species distribution. We then selected 40 grid squares with no previous data along the predicted range margins, and surveyed suitable habitats through presence-sign searches. Faecal samples visually assigned to the species were collected for genetic identification based on the mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene, which resulted in 19 new grid squares with confirmed presence records. The second model (ENM 2) was built by adding the new data, and species distribution maps predicted by each model under current and future climate change scenarios were compared. Both models had high predictive ability, with strong influence of temperature and precipitation. Although current distribution ranges predicted by each model were quite similar, the range shifts predicted under climate change differed greatly when using additional field data. In particular, ENM 1 overlooked areas identified as important by ENM 2 for species conservation in the future. Overall, results suggest that combining ENM with non-invasive genetics may provide a cost-effective approach in studies regarding species conservation under environmental change...|$|E
40|$|Tese de doutoramento, Biologia (Ecologia), Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Ciências, 2013 The <b>Cabrera</b> <b>vole</b> Microtus cabrerae is a Vulnerable {{species in}} Portugal and Spain. The lack {{on the general}} ecology and the {{importance}} of the conservation of this species lead to this thesis, which also has as a goal to contribute to a future conservation plan. It was identified an enlargement of the previously known distribution at a national scale, particularly over the most central region of Portugal, extending its range to the north-eastern side and to the southwest. This vole is not as specialized at a regional scale as it was detected for the national model. The importance of the montado, which was not detected at a national scale, was also highlighted. Contrarily, at the colony scale, open areas with high herbaceous cover determined the occurrence of voles. However, distribution and spacing greatly varied throughout the year. Several demographic and spatial parameters were determined. Although most of them are consistent with previous studies, differences between wet and dry seasons for these parameters had never been reported. The palatability experience revealed a preference of voles for monocotyledons and annual plants, but no relationship with grassland plant communities. The hypothesis that the establishment of a colony is mainly determined by abundance and persistence of plants, rather than by their palatability, was suggested. Post-wildfire recolonisation was studied for the first time. Vegetation structure and composition were closely related to reoccupation. Fire intensity did not influence recolonisation, contrary to distance from unburned areas and the presence of the montado. In this thesis the importance of the montado was reinforced (chapters III and VI) as well as differences detected between seasons (chapters III and IV). Several aspects, such as main distribution areas, habitat characteristics and dietary preferences (chapters II, III and V), are of major importance in the definition of a future national conservation plan for the species.
