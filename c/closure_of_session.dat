In October 1856, the Simons government published its constitutional revision. However, the Chamber of Deputies refused to debate it and passed a vote of no confidence in the government.

MethodsPre- and post-ASD device <b>closure</b> echocardiograms <b>of</b> 25 consecutive patients were retrospectively reviewed. Measurements of RV and LV MPI and LA volumes were made. ResultsTwenty-five patients {{with an average age}} of 45. 5 ± 16. 3 years underwent transcatheter <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> ASD. There was statistically significant improvement in RV MPI (0. 35 to 0. 28, p = 0. 004), LV MPI (0. 37 to 0. 31, p = 0. 04), and LA volume index (25. 7 to 21. 8 ml/m 2, p < 0. 001) after <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> ASD.
