40|$|Introduction Hogan in {{her recent}} paper [4] {{presented}} the requirements and {{the characteristics of}} operating systems to realize the principle of <b>complete</b> <b>mediation.</b> She states "the principle of <b>complete</b> <b>mediation</b> requires that every access to every object be checked for authority.

Wells argues in a later paper [13] that Hogan's discussion "does not apply to contemporary capability-based system technology", and her statement is not true in such systems. Wells used the KeyKOS system [3, 11] as an example. In our opinion, Wells's argument holds for at most one special type of capability systems, which we refer as fully armed systems. In fact, one can argue that in KeyKOS the utilization of a foolproof mechanism for identifying the source is implicitly embedded throughout the system design, which is mixed with other issues and would naturall...|$|E

Sandboxing {{is designed to}} thwart such threats as (1) a program created by an attacker or (2) an input crafted to exploit a security vulnerability in a program.

This is effective for (1) but only partially so for (2). For example, when a file is downloaded by a browser or processed as a mail attachment, the invoking process can sandbox it.

The aim {{of this study was to}} examine mediating effects of various mindfulness facets on effects of a Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) on perceived stress and mood. Methods Outpatients with diabetes types 1 and 2 and low levels of emotional wellbeing were randomized into a group receiving MBCT (n = 70) or a waiting-list control group (n = 69). Primary outcomes were mood and perceived stress. Before, after and at follow-up (6 months post intervention) relevant questionnaires were <b>completed.</b> Results <b>Mediation</b> analysis using bootstrap resampling indicated that increases in total mindfulness and the facets observing and nonreactivity mediated the effects of the intervention on depressed and angry mood, anxiety (only observing), and perceived stress (only nonreactivity) from pre- to post-intervention. In contrast, from post-intervention to follow-up, besides total mindfulness the facets of acting with awareness and nonjudging mediated the effects on depressed, anxious, and angry mood, while only nonjudging mediated the effects on perceived stress. Discussion The findings indicate that increases in levels of mindfulness mediate the effects of the Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy in patients with diabetes. It is notable that different facets may be important for immediate change versus long-term outcome. These findings might be relevant for post-intervention care.

The Baron and Kenny mediation model {{was used to assess}} the degree of the treatment effect upon a response variable in the presence of another variable (i.e., the mediating variable). This approach allowed the examination of the degree of mediation (either as partial or <b>complete</b> <b>mediation),</b> through a series of four models. Statistically significant (p <  0.05) effects must be obtained in Models 1, 2, and 3 in order to test the full mediation model in Model 4. Specifically, ∆MADRS would be considered a partial mediator if: (Model 1) treatment significantly predicts ∆SDS total; (Model 2) treatment significantly predicts ∆MADRS; (Model 3) independent of treatment, ∆MADRS linearly significantly predicts ∆SDS total; and (Model 4) treatment significantly predicts ∆SDS total, even when controlling for the effect of ∆MADRS. <b>Complete</b> <b>mediation</b> would be indicated if the effect of treatment on SDS described in Model 4 was 0.

30|$|There is {{a growing}} body of {{literature}} about SL and its importance in the workplace, but very few studies have adequately examined the mediating role of SL. For example, in Curral and Marques-Quinteiro’s (2009) research, mediation analysis supports the hypotheses that SL skills fully mediated the relationship between learning goal orientation and work role innovation and partially mediated the relationship between intrinsic motivation and work role innovation. The other study found that SL didn’t mediate between group culture and group members’ innovation (Pratoom and Savatsomboon 2012). Additionally, to the best of the author’s knowledge, there has been no research in the literature regarding SL as a full or partial mediator of the relationship between perceived EO and IWB. Baron and Kenny (1986) indicated that partial mediation is the most frequent model in psychology research. Thus, the partial mediation model is the practical choice, if theory and research are ambiguous on form of mediation effect. However, according to James et al. (2006), if theory and research are insufficient to hypothesize <b>complete</b> or partial <b>mediation,</b> testing for full mediation is recommended since full mediation model is the most parsimonious mediation model. James et al. (2006) also indicated that full mediation should serve as the focal or baseline model in evaluating mediation. In the current study, perceived EO has also been proposed to influence IWB through its’ effect on the utilization of general SL skills. Therefore, the proposed hypothesis was tested with a full mediation and compared with a partial mediation model that included the possible direct effect among the main constructs.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Three studies {{addressed}} {{the effectiveness of}} a preventative Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) training for university students and university employees. The studies aimed to explore whether changes in participants' psychological well-being would be mediated by the mechanisms of change theorized as central in ACT. Design and Method: The studies adopted an embedded mixed method, repeated-measures randomised controlled trial design. In the first study 65 participants recruited from a university student population were {{randomly assigned to one of}} two conditions: 1) a training day (6 hours) based on Acceptance 'and Commitment Therapy (ACT); 2) a waiting-list control group. The intervention was delivered to groups of participants. Participants in both conditions were required to <b>complete</b> outcome and <b>mediation</b> measures at baseline (Time 1), at one month (Time 2) and two months after the training (Time 3). At two months post, participants in the intervention group were also asked to provide written feedback reflecting on the impact of the training. The second and third studies utilised similar methodology. Specifically, in the second study, 71 participants were recruited from a university student population, and in the third study 68 participants were recruited from the university workforce. Assessments were completed at similar time points as in the first study. Results: The first study (students) resulted in significant between-group differences on mental health variables at one month benefiting the intervention group. The second study (students) indicated beneficial improvements in the intervention group's mental health at two months post intervention. There was some evidence of ACT-consistent mediation in these studies. The third study (employees) failed to identify significant improvements for participants in the ACT condition although participants in the waiting list group had evidenced deterioration of their mental health at one-month. Participants across studies described the experienced impact of the intervention and noted barriers of engaging with the training skills. Conclusions: Brief ACT preventative interventions could be of potential value as prophylactic approaches. The study identified a requirement of a longer intervention format to enhance engagement with training skills.

The study also examined the extent to which the conceptual model was a good fit to the sample data. A quantitative approach was used to test if there was a significant relationship between market orientation, marketing resources, and business performance. For the purpose, a cross-sectional survey was carried out to obtain data pertaining to market orientation, marketing resources, contextual factors and business performance. The unit of analysis of the study was banks consisting of 3 public and 15 private banks. A sample size of 507 consisting of 492 branch managers and 15 top level marketing managers was used in the survey. With a response rate of 87. 97 %, 446 questionnaires were collected of which 377 were used for data analysis. A SEM was used to test the extent to which the theoretical model fits the sample data. Mediation analysis was used to test the indirect effect of market orientation on business performance and hierarchical regression analysis was used to test whether the relationship was moderated by market dynamism, competitive intensity, and government regulation. Finally, an independent t – test was used to examine the statistical variations between public and private banks in terms of market orientation, marketing resources, and business performance. The confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the modified model was fit with the observed data in terms of chi-square and the individual indices. The total effect of market orientation on business performance was moderate with a 0. 36 regression coefficient. The indirect effect was high with a 0. 91 regression coefficient where <b>complete</b> and inconsistent <b>mediation</b> was found due to suppression effect. The moderation analysis revealed that the interaction effect of market dynamism, competitive intensity, and government regulation was not statistically significant.

A determinação de que esse professor é o responsável pela mediação pedagógica, ao tempo em que atribui uma feição docente ao trabalho desenvolvido, encarcera-o em uma condição de desprestígio profissional ao negligenciar sua formação acadêmica e experiência profissional como suficientes ao desempenho de outras atividades da docência, que nesse caso, ficam a critério de outros membros da equipe de trabalho, deixando a responsabilidade do ensino como uma atividade de segunda grandeza. Os documentos que regem a EAD deixam evidente que o professor tutor é o profissional para atuar exclusivamente com o ensino, responsável em operacionalizar as aulas, executar as atividades, mas incapaz de pensar pedagogicamente sobre o curso que atua. Nesse aspecto, o professor tutor atua em uma situação de semi-institucionalização extrema em relação aos demais perfis de atuação UAB porque ainda que desenvolva a mesma carga horária dos demais partícipes e tenham formação acadêmica bem próximas, o mesmo recebe o menor dos valores de bolsa disponíveis a EAD. Todavia, no contato com os alunos esse professor em pleno exercício de mediação pedagógica mobiliza sistematicamente os conhecimentos específicos de sua formação, de modo a contribuir afirmativamente para a apropriação de conhecimentos, sendo esse o nicho que nos permite afirmar que o professor tutor é um profissional em construção por preencher somente parcialmente os critérios distintivos para considera-lo como um profissional, faltando-lhe o reconhecimento de sua competência investigativa, o recebimento de proventos e instrumentos reguladores elaborados e geridos por ele mesmo. This study {{aimed to}} understand the teaching practice of the E-Learning tutor, from the constitution of their professionalism and knowledge necessary for the exercise of tutoring. Our specific objectives were: to catalogue the concept of tutoring {{on the basis of}} regulatory documents E-Learning/UAB and in the field of literature; to compare the practice of teacher-tutor and the concept(s) formalized in official documents relating to E-Learning; to identify the descriptors of the professionalism of the acting teacher in E-Learning and knowledge necessary for teaching practice in E-Learning. From a methodological point of view, we have conducted a semi-structured interview and we have also made focus group sessions which allowed us to provide an information gathering space, as well as enough testimonials, whose contents have been reviewed, together with the selected legal documents. The analyzes together with the readings revealed that there is a tutoring model designed by the UAB System and replicated by IPES wich {{can be used as a}} reference to selection edicts and also identifiable when drawing a profile of these professionals. We understand that teaching in E-Learning reconfigures itself in a teamwork that requires from its participants different levels of development and complexity of their practices. For a teacher-tutor the following abilities are essencial in their performance: exercise of technical, pedagogical, social-affective and managerial competences which are widely used in teaching-learning situations when in contact with students in the Virtual Learning Environment. The determination which states that this teacher is responsible for teaching mediation imputes him/her a teaching feature to the developed work. Such determination imprisons him/her in a professional debasement condition by neglecting his/her academic background and professional experience as sufficient for the performance of other teaching activities which, in this case, are at the discretion of other members of the workteam, so the responsibility of teaching is set as an activity of the second magnitude. The governing documents the E-Learning make it clear that the teacher-tutor is the right professional to work exclusively with teaching. He/She is responsible for operationalizing the classes, performing the activities, but unable to think pedagogically about the course he/she works at. In this respect the teacher-tutor acts in a situation of extreme semi-institutionalization compared to the other UAB performance profiles because even if they develop the same workload of the other participants and they have very close academic training, he/her receives the lowest teaching fellowship available in E-Learning. However, through contact with students, this teacher in <b>complete</b> pedagogical <b>mediation</b> exercise mobilizes systematically the expertise from his/her academic background, contributing positively to the appropriation of knowledge, which is the place which allows us to state that the tutor is a professional under construction due to fill only half of the distinguishing criteria to consider him/her as a professional, lacking of recognition of his/her investigative skills, as well as receiving proceeds and regulatory instruments elaborated and managed by him/herself...|$|R
40|$|Correct {{enforcement}} of authorization policies {{is a difficult}} task, es-pecially for multi-threaded software. Even in carefully-reviewed code, unauthorized access may be possible in subtle corner cases. We introduce Transactional Memory Introspection (TMI), a novel reference monitor architecture that builds on Software Transac-tional Memory—a new, attractive alternative for writing correct, multi-threaded software. TMI facilitates correct security enforcement by simplifying how the reference monitor integrates with software functionality. TMI can ensure <b>complete</b> <b>mediation</b> of security-relevant operations, eliminate race conditions related to security checks, and simplify handling of authorization failures. We present the design and im-plementation of a TMI-based reference monitor and experiment with its use in enforcing authorization policies on four significant servers. Our experiments confirm {{the benefits of the}} TMI architec-ture and show that it imposes an acceptable runtime overhead. 1...|$|E

These client-sideHTML 5 applications are increasingly accessing sensitive data, including users'personal and social data, sensor data, and capability-bearing tokens. Instead ofthe classic client/server model of web applications, modern HTML 5 applicationsare complex client-side applications that may call some web services, and runwith ambient privileges to access sensitive data or sensors. The goal of thiswork is {{to enable the}} creation of higher-assurance HTML 5 applications. Wepropose two major directions: first, we present the use of formal methods toanalyze web protocols for errors. Second, we use existing primitives to enablepractical privilege separation for HTML 5 applications. We also propose a newprimitive for <b>complete</b> <b>mediation</b> of HTML 5 applications.
