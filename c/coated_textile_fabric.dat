40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{preparation and}} characterisation {{of a range}} of novel conducting polymer <b>coated</b> <b>textiles,</b> which have potential in applications such as static dissipation, EMI shielding, heating elements, composite structures and many military applications. Conducting polypyrrole <b>coated</b> <b>textiles</b> such as nylon Lycra and polyester fabrics have been synthesised using different approaches (Chapter 3). The present study concentrates on preparation of conducting polypyrrole <b>coated</b> <b>textile</b> using an in-situ polymerisation method. A range of characterisation techniques for the inherently conducting polymer (ICP) coated fabrics were used: the stability of the surface resistivity, cyclic voltammetry, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), UV-Vis spectroscopy and Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). It was found that the PPy-coated nylon Lycra fabric {{could be used as a}} wearable strain gauge. The strain gauge characteristics have been investigated using both an Instron machine and a “SmartMotor”. The use of molecular templates to facilitate the polymerisation and the integration of inherently conducting polymers (ICPs) into textiles has been investigated (Chapter 4). Poly(2 -methoxyaniline- 5 sulfonic acid) or [PMAS] is a water-soluble, fully sulfonated polyaniline that has been used as molecular template. In the first step – “dyeing” of PMAS into the textile, the effect of fabric pre-treatment, solution pH as well as solution temperature have been investigated. In the second step the effects of the ratio of PMAS to aniline, the ratio of aniline to ammonium persulfate and the polymerisation temperature on the polymerisation reaction have also been studied. Characterisation of the templated polyaniline coated fabric prepared using the above “Two step” process has been undertaken (Chapter 4). The stability of the conductivity, cyclic voltammetry, UV-Vis spectra, SEM studies, TGA analysis and strain gauge characteristics have been determined. Results indicate that templated PAn-coated wool nylon Lycra can be used as the strain gauge as tested with either the Instron machine or “SmartMotor”. Conducting polymer <b>coated</b> <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics</b> are easily prepared and integrated into truly wearable clothing and garments to create strain sensors with a wide dynamic range. Functional wearable textile sensing systems can monitor human motion, provide immediate bio-feedback to the wearer without changing the properties and functions of the fabric material and with no interference to normal human body motion. This innovative technique can be widely used for injury prevention, rehabilitation, sport technique modification and medical treatment. It will have a number of further potential applications to be used for daily living, work and recreation in the future...|$|R

Surface resistance was measured and analyzed with analysis of variance to determine the coating parameters at 95 % confidence level.

Surface resistance values were decreased by a factor of 100, due to conductive enhancers. As the immersion time and temperature condition varies, surface resistance showed no difference, statistically.

In another study, Hu and coworkers coated single-walled carbon nanotubes with a simple “dipping and drying” process for wearable electronics and energy storage applications. In the recent study, Li and coworkers using elastomeric separator and almost achieved a fully stretchable supercapacitor based on buckled single-walled carbon nanotube macrofilms. The electrospun polyurethane was used and provided sound mechanical stretchability and the whole cell achieve excellent charge-discharge cycling stability. CNTs have an aligned nanotube structure and a negative surface charge. Therefore, they have similar structures to direct dyes, so the exhaustion method is applied for coating and absorbing CNTs on the fiber surface for preparing multifunctional fabric including antibacterial, electric conductive, flame retardant and electromagnetic absorbance properties.|$|R

This work studies the effect of particle <b>coating</b> on a <b>textile</b> <b>fabric</b> where {{the size of the}} particle is of same order of magnitude as the incident wavelength of light, which has not been studied for textiles. Sulfate functionalized PS particles were deposited on cationic cotton, poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) coated nylon-cotton, and cationic cellophane film. The nylon-cotton fabric was obtained from the Army Camouflage Uniform (ACU) and contained three colors. Spherical particles of 0. 2, 0. 5, and 1. 0 ?m in diameter and a non-spherical, mushroom cap shaped particle, 1. 2 ?m in diameter, were used. The PS particles were deposited onto the substrates using aqueous suspensions. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to assess particle deposition on fibers. SEM revealed that the particles were able to conformally coat both nylon and cotton fibers despite their small radius of curvature. Micrographs showed two smaller particles had longer range, single layer coverage of particles on the fibers, while the larger particles were prone to agglomerate. The NIR reflectance of the PS particle coatings textiles materials was assessed using the testing method specified in the US Army standard MILDTL- 44436 A. NIR reflectance data was collected with a spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere to collect diffuse light scatter. The effect of the particle coating on the NIR reflectance was assessed using average reflectance spectra and principal component analysis (PCA). The spectra analysis showed that the change in reflectance on fabric substrates ranged from 0 to 6 units. The PCA effects test was used to confirm that the particle coatings significantly changed the reflectance of the substrates. The analysis also revealed that the particle size influenced the reflectance of the fabrics and that the mushroom cap particle behaved more similarly to the smaller spherical particle than the 1. 0 ?m particle. The PCA results also confirmed the dyes on the nylon-cotton substrate significantly altered the reflectance behavior. Potential improvements to the deposition procedure and particle selection for altering the reflectance of fabrics are also proposed...|$|R
