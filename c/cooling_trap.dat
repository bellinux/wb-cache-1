40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the final precision mass measurements with SMILETRAP I, where a relative precision of < 1 ppb (10 - 9) was reached routinely, {{and the development}} of SMILETRAP II, aiming for measurements with < 0. 1 ppb relative precision. The emphasis of the thesis is on the implementation of new techniques for achieving this precision improvement with SMILETRAP II. The Ramsey multiple-pulse excitation technique was tested at SMILETRAP I, and a reduction of the statistical uncertainty by factor three could by verified. The technique was applied in the last measurement with SMILETRAP I on H 2 + and D+ ions. From these measurements the proton mass was deduced with a relative error of 0. 18 ppb. It was found that temperature dependent magnetic field oscillations limited us from reducing the uncertainties further. A technical achievement of reducing the peak to peak temperature oscillation in the trapping region of SMILETRAP II by a factor four is presented, which should give an extended observation time and likewise improved precision. The new SMILETRAP II super-conducting magnet, with a slightly stronger field of 5. 8 T compared with the previous of 4. 7 T, was installed and adjusted.   A careful field alignment and reduction of inhomogeneities was done for minimizing the disturbances of the cyclotron frequency for improved precision. In that attempt, the localization and control of the trapped ion motion is also important. Thus a new <b>cooling</b> <b>trap</b> was set up. In the spring of 2009 coherent axial motion of a confined ion cloud was discovered in the <b>cooling</b> <b>trap.</b> By observation of the axial oscillations we can see the effects of evaporative cooling in the reduction of the axial energy distribution. Storing the ions up to 1 s in the <b>cooling</b> <b>trap</b> reduces the energy distribution by a factor of five. Other remarkable results of the ion oscillations are also reported.

The reaction and the analytical separation are combined in a single experiment to investigate the Diels–Alder reaction of benzenediazonium- 2 -carboxylate as a benzyne precursor with various anthracene derivatives, i. e. anthracene, 9 -bromoanthracene, 9 -anthracenecarboxaldehyde and 9 -anthracenemethanol.

40|$|Parylene, a non-critical, {{non-toxic}} layer material, {{which is}} not only a candidate for low-K dielectrics, but also well suited for long-term applications in the human body, has been deposited by (plasma-enhanced) chemical vapor deposition of the monomeric species. To that end, a specially-designed reactor exhibiting a cracker tube at its entrance, which serves as the upstream control, and a <b>cooling</b> <b>trap</b> in front of the downstream control has been applied. The process of polymerization has been traced and is explained by evaporating the dimeric species followed by dissociation in the cracker at elevated temperatures and, eventually, to the coating of the polymeric film in terms of thermodynamics. Alternatively, the process of dissociation has been accomplished applying a microwave plasma. In both cases, the monomerization is controlled by mass spectrometry. The window for surface polymerization could be clearly defined in terms of a factor of dilution by an inert gas for the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) case {{and in the case of}} plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), additionally by the power density. The characterization of the layer parameters has been carried out by several analytical tools: scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy to determine the surface roughness and density and depth of voids in the film, which influence the layer capacitance and deteriorate the breakdown voltage, a bulk property. The main issue is the conduct against liquids between the two borders' hydrophilic and hydrophobic conduct, but also the super-hydrophobic character, which is the condition for the Lotus effect.

40|$|A {{decelerator}} will {{be installed}} at GSI {{in order to}} provide and study bare heavy nuclei or heavy nuclei with only few electrons at very low energies or almost at rest. Stripping at relativistic energies will produce highly charged ions. After electron cooling and deceleration in the Experimental Storage Ring the ions are extracted from the storage ring at 4 MeV/u and further decelerated in a combination of an IH and 4 -rod RFQ structure. Finally, they are injected into a Penning trap where the ions are cooled to 4 K. From this trap, the ions can be transferred in a quasi-continuous or pulsed mode to different experimental setups [1]. The low energy beam line connects the radio-frequency quadrupole decelerator with the <b>cooler</b> <b>trap.</b> It provides the differential pumping to separate the extremely good vacuum required for the operation of the <b>cooler</b> <b>trap</b> from the standard high vacuum in the decelerator. Furthermore, the beam diagnosis and matching elements for injection into the strong magnetic field of the trap will be placed in this beam line.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to investigate experimentally the impact of gas phase reactions during a simple ISC process especially the role of heat and oxygen presence in the system. Heat {{plays an important role}} in both air and nitrogen injection experiments because the injected gas needs to be heated first to the set temperature before flushing the system. At a certain temperature, heat induces endothermic chemical reactions. Therefore it is also necessary to include precise descriptions of chemical reactions describing ISC process. However, the application of ISC method in the field is still an issue since it is hard to control the process. This can be related to the complexity observed in the experimental results. One of the difficulties encountering in this experiment is to acquire an evenly distributed heat within the reservoir. This needs further investigation in future work. In the work presented here the chemical reactions occurring during ISC are studied using a T-shaped reactor tube. The vertical part of the reactor was filled with an oil-saturated sand column; through the horizontal part of the reactor at top of the vertical part either nitrogen or air is flown. The experiments with air allow the study of the chemical reactions, which are thought to occur during ISC, while the experiments with nitrogen injection allow the study of the influence of heat on the reactions occurring during ISC. Thereby the focus is on the processes occurring perpendicular to the main gas (air or nitrogen) flow direction. The main results of the experiments are the effluent gas composition, the temperature profile within the vertical part of the reactor and the characterization of the sand and the liquid collected in the <b>cooling</b> <b>trap</b> after the experiment.

After 2.5 min, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure, and the reactor temperature was increased to 160 °C. Next, hydroiodic acid (0.5 mL, Merck, White House Station, NJ, USA) was added, and [11 C]CH 3 I was distilled through a NaOH column (Merck) under argon flow (25 mL/min) and transferred into a second reactor at − 15 °C, containing 10 mg of 6 -O-desmethyl erlotinib (OSI- 774, Selleck Chemicals, Houston, TX, USA) dissolved in 0.3 mL N,N-dimethylformamide, containing 3.5 mg of sodium hydride.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design and}} construction of an experiment to test quantum electrodynamics (QED) {{in the presence of}} strong electromagnetic fields. The g-factor of a charged particle is a dimensionless constant.

In the case of an electron bound in the field of a heavy nucleus, the g-factor is predicted to great accuracy by bound-state quantum electrodynamics (BS-QED). Thus, the accurate determination of the g-factor of an ion inside a Penning trap serves as a stringent test of BS-QED.
