30|$|Moreover, {{the bank}} can use reserve capital as {{variation}} margin. Note that the marginal {{cost of capital}} for using capital as a funding source for variation margin is nil, because when one posts <b>cash</b> <b>against</b> variation margin, the valuation of the collateralized hedge is reset to zero and the total capital amount does not change. If, instead, the bank were to post capital as initial margin, then the bank would record a “margin receivable” entry on its balance sheet, which however cannot contribute to capital since this asset is too illiquid and impossible to unwind without unwinding all underlying derivatives. Hence, capital can only be used as VM, while it seems that IM must be borrowed entirely.|$|R

Due to the uniqueness and the high profit ability of the internationalized electronic firms in the US, they have more earnings and inside capital so that the debt ratio is lower.

5000|$|Before {{dividend}} futures existed, {{an investor}} {{who wanted a}} similar exposure did so by trading a dividend swap. Dividend swaps are the over-the-counter version of dividend futures. They allow two parties to agree to swap in the future a pre-defined amount of <b>cash</b> <b>against</b> the amount of dividends paid by the underlying stock, basket or equity index.Created in the early 2000s, dividend Swaps became very popular because they allowed equity holders to [...] "sell" [...] their future dividends in advance and hence hedge their future dividend stream. The biggest players were investment banks looking to cover their future dividend exposure from derivatives positions they had on their books.The first dividend future was listed in June 2008 by the derivatives exchange Eurex, a derivatives exchange, on the Euro Stoxx 50 dividends, and since then many new dividend futures were created on various exchanges.|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between uncertainty avoidance, multinationality and firm cash holdings. We develop several hypotheses from corporate finance and multinational firm theory, positing that cultural factors as well firm multinationality influence corporate cash holdings. In particular, firms in countries with high uncertainty avoidance hold more cash as a way to hedge against undesired states of nature. At the same time, firm multinationality moderates the effects culture has on the firm's holdings of liquid assets. Based on a large panel of firms in fifty countries, we present evidence consistent with these hypotheses. Firms in countries with high levels of uncertainty avoidance tend to hold more <b>cash.</b> <b>Against</b> commonly held views in cash management, the degree of multinationality of the firm is positively correlated with holdings of cash. At the same time, the effect of national culture on firm's cash holdings is lower for multinationals. These results are economically significant.

5000|$|The basic {{building}} blocks for all derivative contracts are futures and swaps contracts. In energy markets, these are traded in New York NYMEX, in Tokyo TOCOM and online through the IntercontinentalExchange. A future is a contract to deliver or receive oil (in {{the case of an}} oil future) at a defined point in the future. The price is agreed on the date the deal/agreement/bargain is struck together with volume, duration, and contract index. The price for the futures contract at the date of delivery (contract expiry date) may be different. At the expiry date, depending upon the contract specification the [...] "futures" [...] owner may either deliver/receive a physical amount of oil (extremely rare), they may settle in <b>cash</b> <b>against</b> an expiration price set by the exchange, or they may close out the contract prior to expiry and pay or receive the difference in the two prices.

We estimated that, in 2013, 21 % (17 %- 26 %) of ITNs were over-allocated and this has worsened over time as overall net provision has increased. We estimated that rates of ITN loss from households are more rapid than previously thought, with 50 % lost after 23 (20 - 28) months.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} Japanese monetary policy from an institutional perspective. It argues that the BoJ’s conduct of monetary policy is mostly defensible when viewed within its institutional context. Much of the debate among Japanese policymakers on these issues {{can be seen in}} the context of burden-shifting and institutional shirking of responsibility for Japan’s wider structural problems. Japan’s deflationary experience can be given a structural explanation that is more compelling than purely monetary or cyclical interpretations. The Japanese experience also exposes a number of deficiencies in contemporary approaches to modeling monetary policy.

Factoring is introduced briefly by stating its functions, history and development in the world and Turkey. In addition, factoring is compared with Letter of Credit, Open Account, <b>Cash</b> <b>Against</b> Documents, Credit Insurance, Discount on Draft and Conveyance Credit. Moreover the problems of factoring in Turkey are stated and possible solutions are suggested. In this study it is found that factoring has superiority over other alternatives which Turkish firms prefer to use in their sales transactions. The study has also revealed that factoring is not regulated completely by the separate laws in Turkey. Finally, it is concluded that factoring is a financing technique that helps a lot in the development of trade of Turkey both in domestic and foreign markets. Expansion of factoring is inevitable which is fundamentally {{a good thing for the}} Turkish economy and for the factoring industry. Government and factoring firms should do everything to encourage that growth. Public acceptance of factoring is due to professional approach of factors. Caneri, OğuzM. S...|$|R
