5|$|Unidentified police sources {{alleged that}} Condit had {{admitted}} to {{an affair with}} Levy during an interview with law enforcement officers on July 7, 2001. Condit described her to police as a vegetarian who avoided drinking and smoking. He thought that Levy was going to return to Washington, D.C. after her graduation {{and was surprised to}} find out that the lease on her apartment had ended. Investigators searched Condit's apartment on July 10. They questioned flight attendant Anne Marie Smith, who claimed that Condit told her she did not need to speak to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about his personal life. Federal officials began investigating Condit for possible obstruction of justice, as Smith was also involved in an affair with him. (She was not acquainted with Levy.) Upset by leaks to the media, Condit refused to submit to a polygraph test by the D.C. police; his attorney asserted that Condit passed a test administered by a privately hired examiner on July 13. He avoided answering direct questions during a televised interview on August 23, with news anchor <b>Connie</b> <b>Chung</b> on the ABC News program Primetime Thursday. Intensive coverage continued until news of the September 11 attacks superseded the media's coverage of the Levy case.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, the {{creative}} city discourse has pulsated with activity, with academics, policy wonks, national organizations, and community non-profits attempting to find footholds in the conversation. By applying {{the lessons of}} 20 th-century industrial complexes, or "technopoles," to a new conception of production in the 21 st century, city builders, planners, and business developers tackle the new role of fitting the commercial creative sector into Castells's 'networks' and this creative city discourse, in order to generate innovation in the creative city. The thesis aims to closely examine the role that for-profit creative production now plays in the 21 st century urban economic engine {{and the ways in}} which synergy may be created by and among many individual creative firms in the city. The thesis uses the borough of Brooklyn, in New York City, as a case and example of how to go about supporting new kinds of urban creative clusters. The thesis proposes principles, guidelines, and an approach to cluster development, not as a universal solution for currently uncoordinated clustering, but as a place-based example for applying the principles of this thesis. I will review the evolution of 21 st-century production and the emergence of the creative economy, including the case for locating creative production centers in metropolitan locales, in order to illustrate the shape of the new production landscape in the creative city. (cont.) I next present a framework for organizing and developing a 21 st-century creative cluster, and outline fourteen key ingredients to their development. Finally, I apply this framework to a creative-cluster development strategy in Brooklyn, identifying three possible areas of intervention where creative firms already operate, and propose a public-private management entity structure to provide the necessary synergistic 'glue.

2500|$|For a {{short time}} from 1993 to 1995, Rather co-anchored the evening news with <b>Connie</b> <b>Chung.</b> Chung had {{previously}} been a Washington correspondent for CBS News and anchored short news updates on the West Coast.

Although it performed moderately well in the ratings (a 500,000 increase in viewers), her show was suspended once the 2003 Iraq War began. During the war, she was reduced to reading hourly headlines. Once CNN resumed regular programming, Chung requested that CNN resume broadcasting her show as soon as possible. The network responded by cancelling it, even though her contract had not yet expired.

Williams had [...] "difficulties in processing incoming information. She needed to listen or look. She could not use auditory and visual channels at the same time". On Jam Jar (1995), by Fresh Film in association with BBC Four, which aired in the UK, Williams provided her audience with a greater depth of understanding of autism. The documentary provided Joe Geraci with Williams' [...] "provocative argument about academics coming to some kind of understanding of autism" [...] where she described the 'inside-out' world, [...] " [...] has his own system, and it's not an infantile version of [...] system; they haven't learned his system".

2500|$|After {{appearing}} as oil tycoon Adam Steiffel in 1980's The Formula, which was poorly received critically, Brando {{announced his retirement}} from acting. However, he returned in 1989 in A Dry White Season, based on André Brink's 1979 anti-apartheid novel. Brando agreed to do the film for free, but fell out with director Euzhan Palcy over how the film was edited; he even made a rare television appearance {{in an interview with}} <b>Connie</b> <b>Chung</b> to voice his disapproval. In his memoir, he maintained that Palcy [...] "had cut the picture so poorly, I thought, that the inherent drama of this conflict was vague at best." [...] Brando received praise for his performance, earning an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor and winning the Best Actor Award at the Tokyo Film Festival. Brando also scored enthusiastic reviews for his caricature of his Vito Corleone role as Carmine Sabatini in 1990's The Freshman. In his original review, Roger Ebert wrote, [...] "There {{have been a lot of}} movies where stars have repeated the triumphs of their parts—but has any star ever done it more triumphantly than Marlon Brando does in The Freshman?" [...] Variety also praised Brando's performance as Sabatini and noted, [...] "Marlon Brando's sublime comedy performance elevates The Freshman from screwball comedy to a quirky niche in film history." [...] Brando also starred alongside his friend Johnny Depp in the box office hit Don Juan DeMarco (1995) and in Depp's controversial The Brave (1997), which was never released in the United States. Later performances, such as his appearance in [...] (1992) (for which he won a Raspberry as [...] "Worst Supporting Actor"), The Island of Dr. Moreau (in which he was nominated for another [...] "Worst Actor" [...] Raspberry) (1996), and his barely recognizable appearance in Free Money (1998), resulted in some of the worst reviews of his career. However, his last completed film, The Score (2001), was received generally positively.
