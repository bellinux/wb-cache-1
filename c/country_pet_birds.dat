Faecal samples were collected from 88 cages housing different species of <b>pet</b> <b>birds</b> and examined by bacteriological culture and polymerase chain reaction. A total of 13. 6 % of the cage samples were positive for Campylobacter coli. Other Campylobacter spp. were not found. The study shows that C. coli can be isolated from the cages of apparently healthy <b>pet</b> <b>birds,</b> which should therefore be considered as potential carriers of C. coli and a possible source of infection for humans and companion animals...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis E virus (HEV), the causative {{agent of}} {{hepatitis}} E, {{has been reported}} {{in a wide variety of}} animals, including birds, but little is known of HEV infection in <b>pet</b> <b>birds</b> in northwest China. The objective of the present investigation was to examine HEV seroprevalence in three species of <b>pet</b> <b>birds,</b> namely, Eurasian siskin, Oriental skylark, and black-tailed grosbeak from Gansu. Serum samples collected from 685 <b>pet</b> <b>birds</b> from August 2011 to September 2012 were examined independently for the presence of antibodies against HEV. A total of 59 (8. 31 %) <b>pet</b> <b>birds</b> were tested positive for HEV antibodies by the commercially available enzyme immunoassay kits. Of these, the seroprevalence was diverse in different species pet birds; the most frequent level was 10. 83 % (39 / 360) in Eurasian siskin, followed by 6. 57 % (19 / 289) in Oriental skylark, and 2. 29 % (1 / 36) in black-tailed grosbeak.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the association, previously reported in three European studies, between ownership of <b>pet</b> <b>birds</b> {{and the risk}} of lung cancer. DESIGN: A population based case-control study with a structured questionnaire administered by telephone. SETTING: Missouri, a midwestern state in the United States with a population of about 5 million. SUBJECTS: All newly diagnosed cases of primary lung cancer in women aged 30 - 84 years in Missouri from 1 January 1993 to 31 January 1994 reported to the state cancer registry were invited to participate (n = 652); and 629 population based controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Odds ratios were computed in relation {{to whether or not the}} study subject ever kept <b>pet</b> <b>birds,</b> the type of bird kept, and several measures of intensity or duration of exposure. Odds ratios were adjusted for smoking. RESULTS: The odds ratio (95 % confidence interval) for the development of lung cancer associated with keeping <b>pet</b> <b>birds</b> was 0. 84 (0. 65 to 1. 09). The results were similar for the type of <b>pet</b> <b>bird</b> kept, the number of birds kept, the location of the bird in the house, and the duration of ownership. CONCLUSION: The keeping of <b>pet</b> <b>birds</b> carries no excess risk for the development of lung cancer...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that exposure to <b>pet</b> <b>birds</b> increases risk of developing lung cancer. DESIGN [...] Case-control study. Computerised interviews {{were used to assess}} previous exposure to pets and other risk factors for lung cancer. SETTING [...] Three major hospitals treating respiratory disease in former West Berlin. SUBJECTS [...] All people newly diagnosed as having primary malignant neoplasm of the trachea, bronchi, or lung who were 65 or younger and control subjects matched for age and sex from the general population of former West Berlin. 279 cases and 635 controls qualified for the study; 239 cases and 429 controls participated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Odds ratio of developing lung cancer according to whether or not <b>pet</b> <b>birds</b> were kept and the duration of keeping <b>pet</b> <b>birds.</b> RESULTS [...] In addition to the risk of lung cancer imposed by smoking, passive smoking, and occupational exposure to carcinogens, an increased relative risk of 2. 14 (95 % confidence interval 1. 35 to 3. 40) was found among people exposed to <b>pet</b> <b>birds.</b> The adjusted odds ratio for exposures longer than 10 years was 3. 19 (1. 48 to 8. 21). CONCLUSIONS [...] Avian exposure seems to carry a risk of lung cancer. Until the pathogenesis is understood, long term exposure to <b>pet</b> <b>birds</b> in living areas should be avoided, especially among people at high risk of developing lung cancer...|$|R

40|$|Summary The {{relationship}} between <b>pet</b> <b>bird</b> keeping and lung cancer according to exposure to tobacco smoking {{was investigated in}} a case-control study in hospitals of New York City and Washington, DC, USA. Newly diagnosed lung cancer cases (n = 887) aged 40 - 79 years were compared with 1350 controls with diseases not related to smoking, of the same age, gender and date of admission as the cases. The prevalence of <b>pet</b> <b>bird</b> keeping was 12. 5 % in men and 19. 1 % in women. There was no association between ever keeping a <b>pet</b> <b>bird</b> and lung cancer in never smokers (men adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0. 70, 95 % confidence interval (Cl) 0. 15 - 3. 17; women, 1. 32, 95 % Cl 0. 65 - 2. 70), or in smokers and non-smokers combined, after adjustment for ever smoking (men: 1. 28, 95 % Cl 0. 88 - 1. 86; women: 1. 17, 95 % Cl 0. 83 - 1. 64; all: 1. 21, 95 % Cl 0. 95 - 1. 56). Risk did not increase in relation to duration of <b>pet</b> <b>bird</b> keeping. Cases and controls kept similar types of birds. There was a tenfold increase of lung cancer risk associated with smoking among non-bird keepers (adjusted OR = 9. 15). There was no indication of a synergism, either additive or multiplicative, between smoking and <b>pet</b> <b>bird</b> keeping with respect to lung cancer risk.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} keeping birds {{and the risk of}} lung cancer in Sweden. DESIGN: Case control study based on cases of lung cancer and community controls. Interviews were performed by two nurses specially trained for this project. SETTING: Three major referral hospitals located in southwest Sweden. SUBJECTS: All patients aged 75 and under with newly diagnosed lung cancer and of Scandinavian birth who lived in one of 26 municipalities in Gothenburg and Bohus county or Alvsborg county. Potential control subjects matched on county of residence, sex, and closest date of birth were selected from population registries. In the context of a larger case-control study, information on <b>pet</b> <b>birds</b> was obtained from 380 patients with lung cancer (252 men) and 696 controls (433 men). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Odds ratios for lung cancer in relation to whether or not <b>pet</b> <b>birds</b> were kept and the duration of keeping <b>pet</b> <b>birds.</b> RESULTS: The adjusted odds ratio for ever versus never exposed to <b>pet</b> <b>birds</b> at home was 0. 94 (95 % confidence interval 0. 64 to 1. 39) for men and 1. 10 (0. 64 to 1. 90) for women. There was no evidence of a trend for increased risk of lung cancer with duration of bird ownership. CONCLUSION: Bird keeping does not seem to confer any excess risk of lung cancer to Swedish men or women...|$|R
