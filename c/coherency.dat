5|$|Computer systems {{make use}} of caches—small and fast {{memories}} located close to the processor which store temporary copies of memory values (nearby in both the physical and logical sense). Parallel computer systems have difficulties with caches that may store the same value {{in more than one}} location, with the possibility of incorrect program execution. These computers require a cache <b>coherency</b> system, which keeps track of cached values and strategically purges them, thus ensuring correct program execution. Bus snooping {{is one of the most}} common methods for keeping track of which values are being accessed (and thus should be purged). Designing large, high-performance cache coherence systems is a very difficult problem in computer architecture. As a result, shared memory computer architectures do not scale as well as distributed memory systems do.|$|E

The means to secure this presence however involved a bitter argument within the British government, with no <b>coherency</b> in decision making on the Yemen issue. The objective of the British was mainly keeping the Aden base via cooperating with the Federation of South Arabia, which complicated British relations with many global and regional players, {{as well as with}} the rulers of South Arabia themselves. The British involvement was executed mainly via the British Mercenary Organization (BMO), which was capable to stage its own covert operations, independent of London and away from the view of their sponsor Saudi Arabia. The BMO was specifically formed to train and support the royalists on the course of the war.|$|E

For this purpose, a quantum master equation (QME) at finite temperature is derived for the many-body density matrix of an open quantum system. The dynamics and the steady-state properties of the double quantum dot system for arbitrary bias are studied. We will show that how the populations and <b>coherencies</b> of the system states are affected by superconducting leads. The energy parameter of system contains essentially four contributions due to dots system-electrodes coupling, intra dot coupling, two quantum dots inter coupling and superconducting gap. The coupling effect of each energy contribution is applied to currents and <b>coherencies</b> results. In addition, the effect of energy gap is studied by considering the amplitude and lifetime of <b>coherencies</b> to get more current through the system.

40|$|Partial {{coherence}} is {{an important}} quantity derived from spectral or precision matrices and is used in seismology, meteorology, oceanography, neuroscience and elsewhere. If the number of complex degrees of freedom only slightly exceeds the dimension of the multivariate stationary time series, spectral matrices are poorly conditioned and shrinkage techniques suggest themselves. When true partial <b>coherencies</b> are quite large then for shrinkage estimators of the diagonal weighting kind it is shown empirically that the minimization of risk using quadratic loss (QL) leads to oracle partial coherence estimators far superior to those derived by minimizing risk using Hilbert-Schmidt (HS) loss. When true partial <b>coherencies</b> are small the methods behave similarly. We derive two new QL estimators for spectral matrices, and new QL and HS estimators for precision matrices. In addition for the full estimation (non-oracle) case where certain trace expressions must also be estimated, we examine the behaviour of three different QL estimators, the precision matrix one seeming particularly appealing. For the empirical study we carry out exact simulations derived from real EEG data for two individuals, one having large, and the other small, partial <b>coherencies.</b> This ensures our study covers cases of real-world relevance...|$|R

Recent analyses of interdecadal variability in population abundance of the Oriental migratory locust (Locusta migratoria manilensis) in China have revealed negative associations with temperature and positive associations with Yangtze drought and flood frequencies {{during the past}} millennium (AD 957 - 1956). In order to shed {{new light on the}} causal relationships between locust abundance, floods, droughts and temperature in ancient China, we used wavelet analysis to explore how the <b>coherencies</b> between the different variables at different frequencies have been changed during the past millennium. We find consistent in-phase <b>coherencies</b> between locusts and drought/flood frequencies, and out-of-phase <b>coherencies</b> between locusts and temperature and between drought/flood and temperature at period components of 160 - 170 years. Similar results are obtained when historical data of drought/flood frequencies of the Yangtze Delta region are used, despite flood data showing a weak and somewhat inconsistent association with other factors. We suggest that previously unreported periodic cooling of 160 - 170 -year intervals dominate climatic variability in China through the past millennium, the cooling events promoting locust plagues by enhancing temperature-associated drought/flood events. Our results signify a rare example of possible benign effects of global warming on the regional risk of natural disasters such as flood/drought events and outbreaks of pest insects...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{investigated}} {{the interactions between}} heart rate variability and sleep electroencephalogram power spectra. METHODS: Heart rate and sleep electroencephalogram signals were recorded in 8 healthy young men. Spectral analysis was applied to electrocardiogram and electroencephalogram recordings. Spectral components of RR intervals were studied across sleep stages. The cross-spectrum maximum was determined as well as <b>coherencies,</b> gains and phase shifts between normalized high frequency of RR intervals and all electroencephalographic frequency bands, calculated over the first 3 NREM-REM cycles. RESULTS: RR intervals increased from awake to NREM and decreased during REM. Normalized low frequency decreased from awake to NREM and increased during REM while normalized high frequency evolved conversely. Low to high frequency ratio developed in opposition to RR intervals. <b>Coherencies</b> between normalized high frequency and power spectra were high for all bands. The gain was highest for delta band. Phase shift between normalized high frequency and delta differed from zero and modifications in normalized high frequency preceded changes in delta by 41 +/- 14 degrees. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that: (1) all electroencephalographic power bands are linked to normalized high frequency; (2) modifications in cardiac vagal activity show predominantly parallel changes and precede changes in delta band by a phase shift corresponding to a lead of 12 +/- 5 min.

40|$|An astronomically {{calibrated}} {{time scale}} was recently established (Hilgen, 1991 a, b) for the Pliocene and earliest Pleistocene, {{based on the}} correlation of dominantly precession-controlled sedimentary cycles (sapropels and CaCO 3 cycles) in Mediterranean deep-sea sections to astronomical solution Ber 90 (Berger and Loutre, 1991). This time scale, which differed substantially from the conventional time scales then widely used, is essentially confirmed by {{a new generation of}} radiometric dates using the Ar- 40 /Ar- 39 laser fusion technique. To evaluate this time scale, we here extract both precession- and obliquity-related components from late Pliocene - earliest Pleistocene climatic proxy records in the Mediterranean and determine <b>coherencies</b> and phase (time) lags between these components and the respective orbital variations. This work is found to support the new time scale, because significant <b>coherencies</b> are found between the astronomically related components in our proxy records and the orbital variations, not only at the main period of precession but also at the main period of obliquity and, because of the eccentricity modulation of precession, in the low-frequency eccentricity bands of the spectrum. But the calculated time lag between obliquity and 41 -kyr components in the climatic proxy records shows a significant increase of 5. 6 (+/- 1) kyr with respect to the late Pleistocene if the phase relation with precession is kept constant. This increase can be explained by a change in the climate response time to obliquity or to precession, by a small uncertainty in the astronomical solution, or by a combination of these factors...|$|R
40|$|The {{integration}} of climate proxy information with general circulation model (GCM) results offers considerable potential for deriving {{greater understanding of}} the mechanisms underlying climate variability, as well as unique opportunities for out-of-sample evaluations of model performance. In this study, we combine insights from a new tree-ring hydroclimate reconstruction from Scandinavia with projections from a suite of forced transient simulations of the last millennium and historical intervals from the CMIP 5 and PMIP 3 archives. Model simulations and proxy reconstruction data are found to broadly agree on the modes of atmospheric variability that produce droughts–pluvials in the region. Despite these dynamical similarities, large differences between simulated and reconstructed hydroclimate time series remain. We find that the GCM-simulated multi-decadal and/or longer hydroclimate variability is systematically smaller than the proxy-based estimates, whereas the dominance of GCM-simulated high-frequency components of variability is not reflected in the proxy record. Furthermore, the paleoclimate evidence indicates in-phase <b>coherencies</b> between regional hydroclimate and temperature on decadal timescales, i. e., sustained wet periods have often been concurrent with warm periods and vice versa. The CMIP 5 –PMIP 3 archive suggests, however, out-of-phase <b>coherencies</b> between the two variables in the last millennium. The lack of adequate understanding of mechanisms linking temperature and moisture supply on longer timescales has serious implications for attribution and prediction of regional hydroclimate changes. Our findings stress the need for further paleoclimate data–model intercomparison efforts to expand our understanding of the dynamics of hydroclimate variability and change, to enhance our ability to evaluate climate models, and to provide a more comprehensive view of future drought and pluvial risks...|$|R
