50|$|Engine {{flooding}} was {{a common}} problem with carbureted cars, but newer fuel-injected ones are immune to the problem when operating within normal tolerances. Flooding usually occurs during starting, especially under cold conditions or because the accelerator has been pumped. It can also occur during hot starting; high temperatures may cause fuel in the <b>carburetor</b> <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> to evaporate into the inlet manifold, causing the air/fuel mixture to exceed the upper explosive limit. High temperature fuel may also result in a vapor lock, which is unrelated to flooding but has a similar symptom.|$|E
5000|$|Chevrolet {{introduced}} a mechanical fuel injection option, made by General Motors' Rochester Products Division, for its 283 V8 engine in 1956 (1957 U.S. model year). This system directed the inducted engine air across a [...] "spoon shaped" [...] plunger that moved {{in proportion to}} the air volume. The plunger connected to the fuel metering system that mechanically dispensed fuel to the cylinders via distribution tubes. This system was not a [...] "pulse" [...] or intermittent injection, but rather a constant flow system, metering fuel to all cylinders simultaneously from a central [...] "spider" [...] of injection lines. The fuel meter adjusted the amount of flow according to engine speed and load, and included a fuel reservoir, which was similar to a <b>carburetor's</b> <b>float</b> <b>chamber.</b> With its own high-pressure fuel pump driven by a cable from the distributor to the fuel meter, the system supplied the necessary pressure for injection. This was a [...] "port" [...] injection where the injectors are located in the intake manifold, very near the intake valve.|$|R
5000|$|The fuel {{stored in}} the chamber (bowl) {{can be a problem}} in hot climates. If the engine is shut off while hot, the {{temperature}} of the fuel will increase, sometimes boiling ("percolation"). This can result in flooding and difficult or impossible restarts while the engine is still warm, a phenomenon known as [...] "heat soak". Heat deflectors and insulating gaskets attempt to minimize this effect. The Carter Thermo-Quad <b>carburetor</b> has <b>float</b> <b>chambers</b> manufactured of insulating plastic (phenolic), said to keep the fuel 20 degrees Fahrenheit (11 degrees Celsius) cooler.|$|R
5000|$|Johnson and Busk were {{themselves}} {{responsible for the}} construction of the first commercial chainsaw, [...] "Jobu Senior," [...] which had an [...] "Aspin" [...] engine with a standard <b>carburetor</b> with <b>float</b> <b>chamber.</b> Whenever the saw was placed on the side, the carburetor had to be rotated accordingly. Jobu Senior weighed 17.5 kg and was only applicable for felling and bucking.The next model was Junior, which was released on the market in 1952. The engine in Junior was manufactured by Jobu themselves. Junior came with its predecessor carburetor solution that still had to be rotated. The weight was reduced to 10.4 kg. This saw became very popular, and around 40 000 units were produced. Jobu Tiger, which came in 1960, was a major advance. This model had a diaphragm carburetor that worked in all positions.|$|R
2500|$|With {{the success}} of the 1952 season, {{independent}} or [...] "privateer" [...] riders could now purchase a [...] "catalog" [...] version of the 125 DOHC, now available through the company. [...] The Sport Competizione racer had many of the same features as the factory bike. These included a multi-plate clutch, gear-driven oil pump, Dell'Orto 27mm SS1 <b>carburetor</b> and remote <b>float</b> <b>chamber.</b> The bike was nicknamed the [...] "Boy Racer". In 1953, the race engineers adopted the Earles-type forks to help with handling problems on the works racers. The 1953 season saw the introduction of the 350 Four. [...] MV’s racing efforts now included the 500cc, 350cc and 125cc class.|$|R

50|$|The main {{carburettor}} types {{commonly associated}} with Amal are slide carburettors for motorcycles. These were historically distinguishable as two types: the Monobloc with integral, offset <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> and Concentric, a later development with repositioned <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> directly under the body and air-slide.|$|R
50|$|The <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> {{can become}} fouled and stuck leading to poor feeding. When field {{stripping}} the Ace, the recoil spring is removed after removing the slide. The ejector may be removed before removing the barrel and the <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> must be aligned vertically {{to remove the}} barrel from the slide. Once the barrel is removed, the <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> can be rotated and separated from the main barrel for cleaning. When the extractor is replaced into the barrel, {{the back of the}} extractor should slide into the rear slot of the slide.|$|R
5000|$|Carburettors are {{provided}} with a <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> to provide a constant hydrostatic head of fuel above the carburettor's metering jets, thus a constant pressure. The <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> itself does not vary the pressure according to demand, but it does vary the supply flowrate with demand, to keep this pressure constant.|$|R

50|$|A <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> is {{a device}} for {{automatically}} regulating {{the supply of}} a liquid to a system. It is most typically found in the carburettor of an internal combustion engine, where it automatically meters the fuel supply to the engine. However, this arrangement is found in many automatic liquid systems, for example the cistern of a toilet {{could be said to}} be a type of <b>float</b> <b>chamber.</b>|$|R
50|$|Williams {{designed}} and built four semi-automatic rifles while in prison. All four used the high pressure gas within the breech as a cartridge was fired to operate their semi-automatic actions. The means used to accomplish this was a <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> containing the cartridge that channeled the gas {{at the front of}} the chamber to force the <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> backwards into the bolt with sufficient energy to operate the action. Rearward movement of the chamber was limited to a short stroke to impact the bolt face, in effect making the <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> a short stroke gas piston. All four rifles are part of the permanent David Marshall Williams display in the North Carolina Museum of History.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{intention of}} the Fish carburettor was to avoid {{the problems of the}} <b>float</b> <b>chamber,</b> and its sensitivity to sideways forces from acceleration and cornering. In the conventional carburettor, a venturi in the airflow creates a lowered pressure and this is enough to encourage the flow of fuel through the metering jets. The flow rate is critically sensitive to the fuel pressure at the jet, i.e. the hydrostatic head owing to the depth of fuel between the jet and the float level. Any sloshing within the <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> affected this. Fish's design kept the <b>float</b> <b>chamber,</b> but avoided the dependency of flow rate on fuel depth. The <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> was sealed and pressurised by a ram air effect from the air inlet, which then caused fuel to flow through the metering jet. This flow rate was entirely independent of fuel level, but did remain approximately proportional to the mass airflow. The Fish carburettor was also sensitive to mass airflow, rather than volume airflow, making it self-compensating for changes due to temperature or altitude.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{machine guns}} were {{expensive}} to operate. The United States Army wanted to train machine gun crews with less-expensive ammunition. To do this, {{they needed the}} [...]22 LR cartridge to operate firearms designed to use the [...]30-06 cartridge. David Marshall Williams invented a method that involved a separate <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> that acted as a gas piston with combustion gas impinging directly {{on the front of}} the <b>floating</b> <b>chamber.</b> [...] The [...]22 caliber Colt Service Ace conversion kit for the [...]45 caliber M1911 pistol also used Williams' system, which allows a much heavier slide than other conversions operating on the unaugmented blowback mechanism and makes training with the converted pistol realistic. A <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> provides additional force to operate the heavier slide, providing a felt recoil level similar to that of a full power cartridge.|$|R

50|$|The Rothensee {{boat lift}} {{utilizes}} <b>floats</b> in <b>float</b> <b>chambers</b> {{in a similar}} manner to that at Henrichenburg. In this case only two <b>float</b> <b>chambers</b> were needed. The lift follows the patented plans of Rudolf Mussaeus.The trough is 85 metres long and 12.2 metres wide and is supported on two 36 metre long 10 metre in diameter cylindrical floats submerged in two 60 metre deep <b>float</b> <b>chambers.</b> The <b>floats</b> are internally sub-divided into three separate chambers. Each of these chambers is filled with air compressed to a pressure appropriate to its depth in the <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> in order to prevent implosion. The floats provide buoyant lift equivalent to 5,400 tonnes, enough to balance the weight of the trough and its load of water and ship. The trough is set in motion using four worm geared shafts, 27.3 metres long and 42 centimetres in diameter moved by eight 44 kW electric motors. Because the trough and its load are in equilibrium with the floats only the friction opposing the troughs movement needs to be overcome by the motors. A complete lift can be achieved using less than 500 kW of power.|$|R
50|$|Winchester {{introduced}} the shotgun in 1954 as their Model 50 Automatic Shotgun in 12 and 20 gauge. The shotgun featured an Inertia Operated Bolt Lock designed by Williams. The bolt block and cartridge sat within a large <b>floating</b> <b>chamber.</b> When {{the gun was}} fired the gas forward of the <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> forced the chamber to the rear approximately 1/10th of an inch in a short stroke that generated the energy necessary for the bolt block to disengage {{the rear of the}} <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> and operate the semi-automatic action. This was the first semi-automatic shotgun with a fixed non-recoiling barrel. In 1960 Winchester {{introduced the}}ir Model 59 Automatic Shotgun which also utilized the Williams design from the Model 50. This model featured the Winlite 'glass' barrel; it was a thin tube wrapped with micro-filament glass fibre. This model could bullied with the first ever screw-in Versalite choke tubes.|$|R
50|$|One {{drawback}} of {{the basic}} type of <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> described is that it only operates correctly when {{it is the right}} way up, so more sophisticated solutions are needed in aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{aircraft}} of the 1920s and 1930s had a float-type carburetor. They {{are adequate}} for civil aircraft which normally fly upright, but present {{a problem for}} aerobatic aircraft which fly upside-down or otherwise are subject to negative G, especially military fighters. In a <b>float</b> <b>carburetor,</b> the <b>float</b> operates a valve which keeps the fuel level in the carburetor consistent despite varying demands. If the mixture is too rich, the float rises and restricts the fuel flowing in to the <b>float</b> <b>chamber.</b> When the mixture leans, the float falls and allows more fuel in. However, since the float is dependent on gravity to function, the float behaves opposite of its intended design when the aircraft is inverted. It will further enrich a too-rich mixture, or further lean a too-lean mixture. Either condition will cause the engine to stop running. If an airplane equipped with a float-type carburetor is flown under zero-G or negative-G conditions, the fuel metering cannot be relied upon to create a mixture that can be ignited, and the engine will stop running. The problem was keenly felt by the RAF during {{the first years of}} the war, as the Rolls-Royce Merlin equipped Hurricanes and the Spitfires suffered this effect, unlike the direct fuel injection engines of their German counterparts. The problem was solved by installing a flow-restricted orifice that opened only when flying inverted or under negative-G conditions (the R.A.E. restrictor was known as [...] "Miss Shilling's orifice"), but this was only a stopgap solution.|$|R
50|$|The {{overall height}} of the lift {{measured}} {{from the base of}} the underground <b>float</b> <b>chambers</b> to the upper cross beams is 97.21 metres. The water depth in the trough is usually 2.5 metres.|$|R
50|$|Fuel {{injection}} {{systems are}} {{also able to}} operate normally regardless of orientation, whereas <b>carburetors</b> with <b>floats</b> {{are not able to}} operate upside down or in microgravity, such as encountered on airplanes.|$|R
50|$|The Reece-Fish is a {{variable}} choke, side- or downdraught design, with few moving parts to wear or adjust. To change from side-draught to downdraught, the installer simply rotates the <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> {{to suit the}} carburettor orientation.|$|R
50|$|The Williams {{design was}} not {{accepted}} by Remington. The rifle was redesigned by Remington employees K. Lowe and C.C. Loomis using the Williams <b>floating</b> <b>chamber.</b> The rifle was designated the Remington Model 550 and introduced in 1941.|$|R
5000|$|About 1937 Remington Arms {{contracted}} Williams {{to produce}} a [...]22 long rifle caliber rimfire semi-automatic rifle utilizing his <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> intended for the commercial market.

5000|$|A severe form {{of engine}} {{flooding}} occurs when excessive liquid fuel enters the combustion chamber. This reduces the dead {{volume of the}} combustion chamber and thus places a heavy load on the starter motor, such that it fails to turn the engine. Damage (due to excessive compression and even dilution of the lubricating oil with fuel) can also occur. This condition {{is known as the}} engine [...] "flooding out." [...] Possible causes of too much liquid fuel in the engine include a defective <b>carburetor</b> <b>float</b> that is not closing the fuel inlet needle valve, or debris caught in the needle valve preventing it from sealing.|$|R
2500|$|The remedy, {{invented by}} Beatrice [...] "Tilly" [...] Shilling, was {{to fit a}} metal {{diaphragm}} {{with a hole in}} it, across the <b>float</b> <b>chambers.</b> It partly cured the problem of fuel starvation in a dive. The device was commonly referred to as 'Miss Shilling's Orifice'.|$|R
50|$|The Concentric {{design with}} non-protruding <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> was both slimmer and shorter, {{enabling}} easier mounting to two-port cylinder heads. Left or right sided carburettors could be produced from {{basically the same}} die-casting, and the design was compatible with up to 40 degrees of downdraught.|$|R
50|$|The early {{versions}} of the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine came equipped with a SU carburettor. When these aeroplanes performed a negative G force manoeuvre (pitching the nose hard down), fuel was forced upwards {{to the top of}} the <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> of the carburettor rather than into the engine, leading to loss of power. If the negative G continued, the fuel would collect in the top of the <b>float</b> <b>chamber,</b> forcing the <b>float</b> to the floor of the chamber. This would in turn open the needle valve to maximum, flooding the carburettor with fuel and drowning the supercharger with an over-rich mixture. This would lead to a rich mixture cut-out, which would shut down the engine completely, a serious drawback in combat.|$|R
25|$|The double-concentric siphon and {{the funnel}} with bent end for pouring in {{different}} liquids, {{neither of which}} appear in any earlier Greek works, were also original inventions by the Banu Musa brothers. Some of the other mechanisms they described include a <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> and an early differential pressure.|$|R
50|$|David Marshall Williams (November 13, 1900 - January 8, 1975) was the American {{firearms}} {{designer of}} the <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> and the short-stroke piston.

50|$|Unlike carburetor-based systems, {{where the}} <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> {{provides}} a reservoir, fuel injected systems depend on an uninterrupted flow of fuel. To avoid fuel starvation when subject to lateral G-forces, vehicles are often provided with an anti-surge vessel, usually integrated in the fuel tank, but sometimes as a separate, small anti-surge tank.|$|R
2500|$|Working for the U.S. Ordnance Office, David Marshall Williams {{developed}} a [...]22 training {{version of the}} M1911 using a <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> to give the [...]22 long rifle rimfire recoil similar to the [...]45 version. As the Colt Service Ace, this was available both as a pistol and as a conversion kit for [...]45 M1911 pistols.|$|R
