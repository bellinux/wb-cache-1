50|$|TENTE International GmbH, {{based in}} Cologne, Germany, is {{the holding company}} of the TENTE Group. <b>Castors</b> <b>and</b> <b>wheels</b> are {{manufactured}} under the TENTE registered trademark.|$|E
50|$|TENTE South Africa, TENTE's first branch office, {{was founded}} {{together}} with the Protea Holding Group in South Africa in 1971. In 1973, TENTE-ROLLEN GmbH expanded and started to operate a second high rack warehouse. TENTE USA is situated in Hebron, Kentucky, and was founded in 1979. It develops and produces <b>castors</b> <b>and</b> <b>wheels</b> specifically for the US market.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} the company began in 1923 in the {{district}} of Wermelskirchen Tente with the sale of ball castors and castors for sliding cupboard doors. TENTE-ROLLEN GmbH in Wermelskirchen is the largest subsidiary of TENTE International GmbH. With the production of <b>castors</b> <b>and</b> <b>wheels</b> for hospital beds, shopping trolleys, furniture and transport trolleys, TENTE developed into the city's second largest employer in the following years.|$|E
50|$|TENTE {{produces}} special {{heavy duty}} <b>castors,</b> central-locking <b>castors</b> <b>and</b> forklift <b>wheels</b> for safe <b>and</b> easy transportation of loads weighing several tonnes.|$|R
30|$|There {{are various}} types of wheels used in wheeled mobile robots including: standard, <b>castor</b> <b>and</b> {{omnidirectional}} <b>wheels.</b> The proposed design in this paper uses two standard wheels powered by two motors. The advantages of the used standard wheels include the simplicity in design and manufacturing and the relatively good reliability. The small size of used wheels (10  cm diameter) helps in providing better stability and stronger grip with the floor. This adds to the stability and rigidity of the entire system while carrying out material handling tasks. The simple manufacturing process of standard wheels assures minimum positioning errors while movement.|$|R
50|$|The FH77 is manoeuvred by the gun layer, {{controlling}} the torque {{of the two}} main wheels through a joystick. Speed is regulated by changing the APU's RPM. The howitzer is deployed by spreading the trail legs, raising the <b>castor</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>and</b> driving the howitzer in reverse to anchor the recoil spades.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{floor jack}} (aka 'trolley jack') a {{horizontal}} piston pushes {{on the short}} end of a bellcrank, with the long arm providing the vertical motion to a lifting pad, kept horizontal with a horizontal linkage. Floor jacks usually include <b>castors</b> <b>and</b> <b>wheels,</b> allowing compensation for the arc taken by the lifting pad. This mechanism provides a low profile when collapsed, for easy maneuvering underneath the vehicle, while allowing considerable extension.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, TENTE {{founded a}} {{production}} plant and a sales office in Suzhou, China. In {{the two years}} that followed, further subsidiaries emerged in Hungary, Finland, Canada, Norway and Japan. In 2007, TENTE-ROLLEN GmbH founded a subsidiary in Poznań, Poland, which became a subsidiary of TENTE International GmbH in 2013. TENTE Schwerlasttechnik GmbH, specialising {{in the manufacture of}} heavy duty <b>castors</b> <b>and</b> <b>wheels,</b> was founded in 2008. The agent in Denmark (a TENTE agent since 1961) became a subsidiary in the same year. In the two years that followed, TENTE founded further subsidiaries in Italy, Latvia, Russia, Australia and Switzerland. In 2013, two more subsidiaries were founded, this time in Belarus and in the Ukraine.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{industrial}} application for robotized handling of sheets in a workshop. Sheet metal parts {{are used for}} manufacturing <b>castors</b> <b>and</b> <b>wheels.</b> The problem is to pick sheets from a cradle where the parts are disordered. First, the picked sheet is located roughly, second it is posed accurately, and finally it is moved to a next working step. A flexible machine vision system is built by combining several image processing techniques such as edge detection, distance transforms, and blob analysis. The robot cell with vision consists of a robot, two cameras with three light sources, and a PC with a Matrox image processing board. 1 Introduction In recent {{years there has been}} an increasing interest to robotize workshops [7]. A flexible production and good quality are two of the most important issues since usually production consists of numerous parts and short series. Thus, {{there is a need for}} flexible and reliable vision systems to replace manual operations at the robot l [...] ...|$|E
5000|$|Planchettes took on {{a variety}} of forms during the height of their popularity. American {{planchettes}} were traditionally heart- or shield-shaped, but manufacturers produced a wide range of shapes and sizes hoping to distinguish themselves in the highly competitive and profitable market of the devices' late-1860s heyday. Manufacturers espoused the wonders and benefits of different materials (including various hardwoods, India rubber, and even glass), insulated <b>castors,</b> <b>and</b> various attachments meant to [...] "charge" [...] the devices or insulate the user from malevolent spirits. In Great Britain, planchettes took on the classical shapes popularized in early illustrations and newspaper depictions, with round, blunt noses and flat backs. Regardless of their shape or country of origin, almost all planchettes were equipped with brass <b>castors</b> <b>and</b> small <b>wheels</b> of bone or plastic, and their sometimes lavishly illustrated boxes were often packed with blank parchment, pencils, ouija-like folding letter sheets, and esoteric instructions espousing the mysterious communicative powers of the items.|$|R
40|$|A {{new concept}} for {{omni-directional}} platform and vehicle design using active split offset castors is presented. An active split offset castor (ASOC) unit {{consists of two}} coaxial conventional <b>wheels</b> driven independently <b>and</b> connected to the platform chassis by a link. The kinematics and characteristics of the ASOC are analyzed and compared with conventional active <b>castors</b> <b>and</b> steered <b>wheels.</b> The concept of building omni-directional platforms and vehicles using the ASOC is presented and their design and control are discussed. Experimental results from a prototype omni-directional platform are presented, which demonstrate the feasibility of the concept. INTRODUCTION Omni-directional mobile robots or automated vehicles could perform important tasks in environments congested with static and/or dynamic obstacles and narrow aisles, such as those commonly found in nuclear plants, offices, factory workshops and warehouses, eldercare facilities and hospitals (West and Asada, 1997). Current whee [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a motion controller for differential drive vehicles with a compensation for castor wheel turn forces. The controller {{has been developed}} for electric wheelchairs with two front castor wheels, which require large steering forces {{to move into the}} direction given by the joystick in situations where a sharp turn of the castor wheels is needed. It computes the required forces to turn the <b>castor</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>and</b> modifies the drive request adequately. This also helps physical or cognitive impaired users who otherwise have to compensate castor turn forces manually using the joystick, which requires fast reaction time (e. g. when the castor wheels turn quickly into the driving direction) to avoid collisions. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Premature {{failures}} of wheelchairs in less-resourced environments (LREs) {{may be because}} of shortcomings in product regulation and quality standards. The standards published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) specify wheelchair tests for durability, safety and performance, but their applicability to products used in the rugged conditions of LREs is unclear. Because of this, wheelchair-related guidelines published by the World Health Organization recommended developing more rigorous durability tests for wheelchairs. Objectives: This study was performed to identify the additional tests needed for LREs. Methods: First, a literature review {{of the development of}} ISO test standards, wheelchair standards testing studies and wheelchair evaluations in LREs was performed. Second, expert advice from members of the Standards Working Group of the International Society of Wheelchair Professionals (ISWP) was compiled and reviewed. Results: A total of 35 articles were included in the literature review. Participation from LREs was not observed in the ISO standards development. As per wheelchair testing study evidence, wheelchair models delivered in LREs did not meet the minimum standards requirement. Multiple part failures and repairs were observed with reviewed field evaluation studies. ISWP experts noted that several testing factors responsible for premature failures with wheelchair parts are not included in the standards and accordingly provided advice for additional test development. Conclusion: The study findings indicate the need to develop a wide range of tests, with specific tests for measuring corrosion resistance of the entire wheelchair, rolling resistance of <b>castors</b> <b>and</b> rear <b>wheels,</b> <b>and</b> durability of whole wheelchair <b>and</b> <b>castor</b> assemblies...|$|R
40|$|This report {{discusses}} the design, construction, {{and evaluation of}} a hydraulic oil filtration car sponsored by Papich Construction Inc. This company developed {{the need for a}} filter cart system to service equipment by flushing and cleaning the oil in hydraulic reservoirs and systems. The opportunity of reviewing an existing product from Caterpillar was taken to obtain basic design parameters. This car however, did not meet all the needs preferred by the service technicians of Papich; thus leading {{to the idea of a}} custom filter cart. The filter cart is composed of a square tube frame sitting on pneumatic no-flat <b>castor</b> <b>wheels,</b> <b>and</b> features a 28 -gallon oil reservoir with black pipe plumbing through six Caterpillar filters in series. Hydraulic oil can be pumped from either a suction hose or the cart 2 ̆ 7 s reservoir and through the filter series by way of a pneumatic diaphragm pump. The design of this cart allows service technicians to easily transport, operate, and maintain its components...|$|R
