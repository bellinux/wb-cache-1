5|$|Another early {{subwoofer}} enclosure {{made for}} home and studio use was the separate bass speaker for the Servo Statik 1 by New Technology Enterprises. Designed as a prototype in 1966 by physicist Arnold Nudell and airline pilot Cary Christie in Nudell's garage, it used a second winding around a custom Cerwin Vega 18-inch (45cm) driver to provide servo <b>control</b> <b>information</b> to the amplifier, {{and it was}} offered for sale at $1795, some 40% more expensive than any other complete loudspeaker listed at Stereo Review. In 1968, the two found outside investors and reorganized as Infinity. The subwoofer was reviewed positively in Stereophile magazine's winter 1968 issue as the SS-1 by Infinity. The SS-1 received very good reviews in 1970 from High Fidelity magazine.|$|E

Failure to recognize injured people's sexual and reproductive capacity restricts their access to birth <b>control,</b> <b>information</b> about sexuality, and sexual health-related medical care such as annual gynecological exams.

500|$|In the United States, Margaret Sanger and Otto Bobsein popularized {{the phrase}} [...] "birth control" [...] in 1914. Sanger {{primarily}} advocated for birth {{control on the}} idea that it would prevent women from seeking unsafe abortions, but during her lifetime, she began to campaign for it {{on the grounds that it}} would reduce mental and physical defects. She was mainly active in the United States but had gained an international reputation by the 1930s. At the time, under the Comstock Law, distribution of birth <b>control</b> <b>information</b> was illegal. She jumped bail in 1914 after her arrest for distributing birth <b>control</b> <b>information</b> and left the United States for the United Kingdom. In the U.K., Sanger, influenced by Havelock Ellis, further developed her arguments for birth control. She believed women needed to enjoy sex without fearing a pregnancy. During her time abroad, Sanger also saw a more flexible diaphragm in a Dutch clinic, which she thought was a better form of contraceptive. Once Sanger returned to the United States, she established a short-lived birth-control clinic with the help of her sister, Ethel Bryne, based in the Brownville section of Brooklyn, New York in 1916. It was shut down after eleven days and resulted in her arrest. The publicity surrounding the arrest, trial, and appeal sparked birth control activism across the United States. Besides her sister, Sanger was helped in the movement by her first husband, William Sanger, who distributed copies of “Family Limitation.” Sanger’s second husband, James Noah H. Slee, would also later become involved in the movement, acting as its main funder.|$|E
40|$|Dysfunction of high <b>controlled</b> <b>information</b> {{processing}} {{is present}} in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) {{right at the beginning}} of the disease. One hypothesis is that disruption of communication inside large-scale cortical networks, occurring as a consequence of white matter damage, may constitute the anatomical substrate of cognitive impairment at the very early stage of MS. Disturbance of interregional synchronization might be the main pathogenic factor in <b>controlled</b> <b>information</b> processing deficiency in early MS. Preliminary functional MRI studies (fMRI) have provided important clues to corroborate the connectivity hypotheses. First, brain connectivity assessed by fMRI has brought new data about the influence of diffuse white matter damage on connectivity efficiency inside large-scale networks. These studies have suggested that connectivity disturbances occur inside the working memory network in patients at the very early stage of MS and appear related to the extent of structural white matter damage. Also, fMRI studies have suggested that patients may partially compensate for connectivity impairment by a greater cognitive control. Such a compensatory mechanism could limit the determinant functional impact of diffuse white matter damage on high <b>controlled</b> <b>information</b> processing...|$|R
40|$|This {{exploratory}} {{research in the}} sociology of talk is focused on three questions for analysis: (1) to what extent does verbal <b>information</b> <b>control</b> occur in interaction, (2) what forms of verbal <b>information</b> <b>control</b> are used by people, and (3) what reasons do people give for <b>controlling</b> verbal <b>information?</b> One hundred and thirty (130) dyadic encounters were recorded and analyzed; the "actor " is the respondent and the "other " is the person with whom actor has the conversa-tion. An analysis of these encounters revealed that {{nearly two-thirds of the}} 870 instances of verbal communications were talk which <b>controlled</b> <b>information.</b> Frequency tables and typologies delineate (1) forms of <b>information</b> <b>control</b> and (2) reasons for <b>information</b> <b>control.</b> Although most codes of ethics, religious canons, and humanitarian ideals deprecate deception in whatever form, conversations in everyday life are noticeably characterized by forms of deceit ranging from "white lies " to exploitative prevarication. Analysis of dyadic conversations shows that not only are forms of deception frequently employed, they are necessary, even mandatory discursive elements. In everyday conversations, honesty is not always the best policy...|$|R

The series of Rhodesian High Court cases debating the legality of UDI {{came to a close}} five months later on 13 September.
