40|$|Abstract Clean up {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} steps to remove co-extractives and undesired interfering substances from the sample before analysis in pesticide residue analysis. Some advanced, sophisticated and efficient methods of clean up have emerged out which is able to save time as well as amount of solvents. These are Solid Phase Extraction (SPE), Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) and Supercritical Fluid Chromatography (SFC). They are very much efficient for clean up and extraction of pesticide samples. SPE method is successfully used for clean up of pesticide residue from soil and water samples. GPC is now widely used in sample preparation in many residue laboratories and is effectively used for multi-residue analysis. SFC is by far the best method of clean up and extraction, though it involves high cost. Thus, various suitable clean up methods can free pesticide residues from extraneous <b>co-extractive</b> materials in an efficient manner and helps to prepare a good sample for further analysis...|$|E

40|$|Size {{exclusion}} chromatography (SEC) {{was applied}} for purification of psychoactive biomolecules from plants. These molecules {{are in the same}} molecular weight range, but do not necessarily share other chemical properties, that makes the SEC technique efficient. By applying SEC as a first purification step much of the <b>co-extractives</b> from the plants can easily be removed. Large amounts of target substance can be obtained with little effort if the system is automated. Combining SEC with a second purification step, consisting of normal phase chromatography, provides high purity of the target substance. Both known and unknown psychoactive biomolecules can easily be purified using the purification method developed in this Master's Thesis. Purifications that previously required long time and much "hands-on" can be completed much faster and with less manual work.

40|$|AbstractThe {{components}} of seven matrices {{in the analysis}} of 11 pesticides by GC-ECD were analysed. The matrix effect was calculated based on the changing of chromatographic response of the analyte in the presence of <b>co-extractives</b> of the matrices in the organic phase obtained by solid–liquid and liquid–liquid extraction with partition at low temperature (ESL-PBT and ELL-PBT), in relation to the response of it in the pure solvent. It was used the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in evaluating the results obtained for the percentages of the matrix effect. The tomato, grape and pineapple matrices caused greater matrix effect and were grouped. The other matrices such as apple, water and potato caused small matrix effect. For most pesticides the soil matrix caused negative matrix effect. The influence of pH of the samples on the matrix effect was also evaluated showing not to have a direct effect on the phenomenon...|$|R

40|$|A multiresidue {{method for}} the {{analysis}} of 28 common organophosphorus pesticides and 3 of their main metabolites (paraoxon-ethyl, paraoxon-methyl and malaoxon) in a variety of crop samples has been developed. An aliquot of the chopped sample is homogenized with an organic solvent. The efficiency of extraction methods using methanol, acetone and acetonitrile was evaluated. The acetonitrile gives higher recoveries and minimizes <b>co-extractives</b> from the samples matrix. The resulting aqueous acetonitrile extract is filtered and cleaned by solid phase extraction (SPE). For SPE three different types of adsorption materials (Carbograph 1, LiChrolut-EN and Amberchrom CG- 161 m) were compared. The cleaned-up extract is injected into the LC system. Three different analytical columns were tested in conjunction with two mobile phase compositions of different polarity. The use of LC-DAD techniques allowed the identification of bath organophosphorus pesticides and metabolites by means of standard and spectral comparison, respectively.

40|$|A {{high-performance}} liquid chromatographic (HPLC) {{method was}} developed to determine buprofezin residues in hulled rice and fruits. The buprofezin residue was extracted with acetone and the extract was stepwise purified by liquid-liquid partition and Florisil column chromatography.

Reversed phase HPLC using an octadecylsilyl column was successfully applied to separate buprofezin from sample <b>co-extractives,</b> as detected by ultraviolet absorption at 250 nm. Recovery experiment at the limit of quantitation validated that the proposed method could evidently determine the buprofezin residue {{at the level of}} 0. 02 mg/kg.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to develop new sample preparation procedures for the isolation of sulfonamides, as well as, to determine the applicability of employing on-line nitrogen selective and mass spectrometric detection methods. The first phase of this research investigated the effect of temperature and pressure on the supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) of sulfonamides from a spiked sand matrix. Temperature effects were either positive or negative with respect to extraction rate and total recovery, depending on the pressure and extraction fluid employed. The second portion of this research compared trifluoromethane (CHF 3) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) as fluids for the extraction of sulfonamides from spiked non-fat dry milk, beef liver, and egg yolk were found to be more selective using CHF 3 than CO 2. The polar trifluoromethane improved the extraction efficiency of the polar sulfonamides from the biological matrices and also reduced the amount of <b>co-extractives.</b> The next phase of this research considered the ffect of organic modifier and CO 2 i the SFE of sulfonamides from chicken liver, beef liver and egg yolk.

40|$|A {{comparison}} of dispersive and cartridge solid-phase extraction, d-SPE and c-SPE, respectively, for the clean-up step using the modified QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe) method, followed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with {{diode array detection}} (UHPLCDAD) was carried out for the determination of pesticide residues in strawberries. Dry ice {{was used in the}} experiments for the evaluation of different temperatures. The efficiency of liquid-liquid partitioning step without salts was also evaluated. In all the experiments, the sorbent used in the clean-up step was primary secondary amine (PSA), and the evaluation of the sample preparation was made by the physical aspect of the final extract, the chromatographic profile, the recovery, the amounts of <b>co-extractives</b> in the matrix, which were determined by gravimetric measurements, and the matrix effect. A good cleanup procedure contributes to a longer lifetime of the chromatographic column and also for the entire system, and it also leads to better detectability for the developed method. Results showed that all the sample preparation methods were efficient for multiresidue pesticide analysis in this complex matrix, in which analytes with different physicochemical characteristics at low concentrations are present. The recovery results were in the range of 70 - 120 %, and the coefficients of variation were <= 20 % for most of the pesticides, as recommended for these analyses. The clean-up of the strawberry extracts was more efficient with the use of d-SPE at ambient temperature, considering the higher recoveries of the pesticides and better clean-up by removal of interferences; moreover, it was faster, easier and less expensive...|$|R
40|$|A simple, specific, {{and rapid}} {{analytical}} method for determining seven largely used carbamate insecticides in tomato, spinach, lettuce, zucchini, pear, and apple is here presented. This method {{is based on}} the matrix solid-phase dispersion technique, with heated water as extractant followed by liquid chromatography (LC) -mass spectrometry (MS) equipped with a single quadrupole and an electrospray ion source. Target compounds were extracted from the vegetal matrixes by water heated at 50 degreesC. After acidification and filtration, 0. 25 mL of any aqueous extract was injected in the LC column. MS data acquisition was performed in the selected ion monitoring mode, selecting three ions for each target compound. Heated water appeared to be an excellent extractant because recovery data ranged between 76 (carbaryl in spinach) and 99 % (pirimicarb in spinach), with RSDs not larger than 10 %. Using trimethacarb (an obsolete carbamate insecticide) as a surrogate internal standard, the accuracy of the analysis varied between 84 and 110 %, with RSDs not larger than 9 %. On the basis of a signal-to-noise ratio of 10, limits of quantification were estimated to range between 2 (pirimicarb) and 10 ppb (oxamyl) and were not influenced by the type of matrix. When trying to fractionate analytes by using a short chromatographic run time, marked weakening of the ion signals for oxamyl, methomyl, and aldicarb were observed. This effect was traced to polar endogenous <b>co-extractives</b> eluted {{in the first part of}} the chromatographic run that interfered with gas-phase ion formation for carbamates. Adopting more selective chromatographic conditions eliminated this effect...|$|R
40|$|The rapidly {{expanding}} field of per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs) research {{has resulted in}} a wide range of analytical methodologies to determine the human and environmental exposure to PFASs. This paper reviews the currently applied techniques for sample pre-treatment, extraction and clean-up for the analysis of ionic and non-ionic PFASs in human and environmental matrices. Solid phase extraction (SPE) is the method of choice for liquid samples (e. g. water, blood, serum, plasma), and may be automated in an on-line set-up for (large volume) sample enrichment and sample clean-up. Prior to SPE, sample pre-treatment (filtration or centrifugation for water or protein precipitation for blood) may be required. Liquid-liquid extraction can also be used for liquid samples (and does not require above mentioned sample pretreatment). Solid-liquid extraction is the commonly applied method for solid matrices (biota, sludge, soil, sediment), but automation options are limited due to contamination from polytetrafluorethylene tubings and parts applied in extraction equipment. Air is generally preconcentrated on XAD-resins sandwiched between polyurethane foam plugs. Clean-up of crude extracts is essential for destruction and removal of lipids and other <b>co-extractives</b> that may interfere in the instrumental determination. SPE, (fluorous) silica column chromatography, dispersive graphitized carbon and destructive methods such as sulphuric acid or KOH treatment can be applied for clean-up of extracts. Care should be taken to avoid contamination (e. g. from sample bottles, filters, equipment) and losses of PFASs (e. g. adsorption, volatilization) during sampling, extraction and clean-up. Storage at - 20 °C is generally appropriate for conservation of samples. © 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|A simple, specific, {{and rapid}} confirmatory method for {{determining}} 12 sulfonamide (SAs) antibacterials in bovine {{liver and kidney}} is presented. This method {{is based on the}} matrix solid-phase dispersion technique with hot water as extractant followed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) with an electrospray ion source. The method was tailored for use with both single-quadrupole MS (I) and triple-quadrupole MS (II) instruments. After acidification and filtration of the aqueous extract, a 250 -muL aliquot was injected into instrument I while only 25 muL was analyzed by instrument II. With instrument I MS data acquisition was performed in the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode, selecting at least three ions for each target compound. With instrument II the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode with three fragmentation reactions for each compound was chosen. With the exception of sulfaquinoxaline (SQX), recovery of the analytes at the 50 ppb level in both liver and kidney was 72 - 96 % with relative standard deviations (RSDs) ranging between 3 and 11 %. The very poor recovery of SQX was due to its rapid enzymatic oxidation when in contact with the two tissues. With instrument 1, limits of quantification (LOQs, S/N = 10) were 5 - 14 ppb of SAs. Even lower LOQs (1 - 8 ppb) were estimated by using instrument 11, even though the extract volume analyzed was ten times lower than that with instrument I. With both matrices and using instrument 1, severe ion signal suppression was experienced for the early-eluted SAs when trying to fractionate analytes by using a short chromatographic run time. This effect was traced to polar endogenous <b>co-extractives</b> eluted {{in the first part of}} the chromatographic run that interfered with gas-phase ion formation for SAs.

40|$|The toxic {{effects of}} Persistent Organic Pollutants' (POPs) in the {{environment}} are well documented. Marine mammals,are particularly vulnerable and there is currently much interest in monitoring POPs levels within their bodies. It is normal practice to use blubber samples for analysis but this can only be obtained from dead animals so availability is limited. In this study, a new method was investigated using seal faecal samples {{for the analysis of}} POPs. This matrix was chosen because it can be readily collected without causing undue stress to the animals. The first stage of the project involved chromatographic characterisation of the analytes of interest. A total of 55 compounds were investigated and these originated from four different POPs subgroups (OCPs, PCBs, PCDDs and PBDEs). Analytical standard solutions were initially run on a gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector (GCÆCD) and co¬elution problems were identified. It was demonstrated that these co-elution problems could not be satisfactorily resolved simply by altering the GC parameters and hence compounds pre¬fractionation would be necessary. It was also found that OCPs could not be reliably analysed on the instrument because they were degrading. Significant progress was made {{in the development of a}} clean-up method using HPLC with a silica column that separated POPs from seal faecal sample <b>co-extractives.</b> Faecal samples were spiked with the 55 investigated POPs, and very good contaminant recoveries were recorded after clean-up. Additionally, a suitable solvent (acetone) was identified for the backflushing of the column and all lipid content of the injected faecal sample was recovered. Although more development is required they were indications that pre-fractionation of OCPs could be achieved. Additional pre-fractionation of POPs was investigated using the Power-Prep system and elution profiles were established using columns of either alumina or Florisil. Separation of the non-ortho PCBs and dioxins was successfully achieved on Florisil and this was in agreement with published work. However, when all compounds were injected together there were significant changes in elution profile and thus it was concluded that column capacity had been exceeded. Results are discussed in a general manner and possible explanations for the problems experienced are presented. Suggestions for improving the method are also detailed...|$|R
40|$|The novel {{application}} of combination, or two stage, photochemical and microbial degradation systems for removal of resin acids from natural river water and single stage photolysis for degradation of naphthenic acids in natural river water was investigated. The organic compounds {{included in this}} project comprise naphthenic acid model compounds and mixtures as well as four resin acids. Naphthenic acids are crude oil-derived and accumulate to significant concentrations (> 100 mg/L) in tailings pond water at oil sands extraction facilities. Resin acids are pulp and paper mill-derived compounds that tend to persist at low levels in receiving waters. For each compound group, analytical methods utilizing liquid chromatography negative ion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC/ESI/MS) were developed. The main hurdle to developing analytical methods for the naphthenic acids and resin acids are related to their polarity, complexity, and lack of available standards for the various individual components. As well, <b>co-extractives,</b> such as humic and fulvic acids, tend {{to interfere with the}} detection of naphthenic acids in aquatic samples (Headley et al., 2002 a). Resin acid mixtures are not as complex as the naphthenic acids, although each group of hydrocarbon acids may include several isomeric compounds. The {{application of}} photochemical degradation prior to biodegradation was proven to be effective here for rapid degradation of the resin acids. In general, the resin acid precursors were more susceptible to the photolysis than were the naphthenic acids. Through thermal maturation and increased complexity, the naphthenic acids seemingly become more resistant to degradation, as evidenced by their commercial use as anti-microbial agents and the observed resistance to photolysis noted in this research. The results of this research may be significant for the design of staged treatment for reduced microbial shock loading and increased bioavailability (defined here as the ability of microbial organisms to degrade the target contaminants) in both bioremediation systems and receiving waters. Specifically, four selected pulp and paper mill-associated resin acids were exposed to several ultraviolet/visible (UV/vis) spectrum radiation sources in water collected from the River Saale in Germany. Background resin acid concentrations were observed in water collected in 2001 and 2002 from various locations along the well-forested River Saale and a manuscript detailing these results published. Analyses of water samples collected in the pulp and paper milling region of the river (in the state of Thuringia) indicated that resin acids persist through biodegradation treatment systems and for several hundred kilometres downstream. All four resin acids were degraded by facile photochemical and microbial degradation with pseudo-first-order kinetics. Half-life values were in the ranges of 18 to 200 minutes for photolysis applications, 8 to 40 hours for biodegradation applications and 3 to 25 hours for two-stage photochemical-microbial degradation processes, in which photolysis was limited to three hours. From these results, it was shown conclusively that photolysis pre-treatment is a viable and efficient method for reducing both resin acid concentrations and the associated acute toxicity. The naphthenic acids investigated in this study were not effectively degraded via UV/vis radiation, including UV-A/UV-B radiation between 300 - 400 nm, near-monochromatic UV 254 -radiation, full spectrum artificial solar radiation and natural sunlight. The photochemical degradation potential of three model naphthenic acid compounds and three naphthenic acid mixtures (one extract from the Athabasca Oil Sands and two commercial mixtures) were examined in Athabasca River water. Photolysis at UV 254 was the most successful degradation source in all instances, although most naphthenic acids were not significantly degraded by any of the radiation sources. Therefore, it was determined that photolysis is not likely to contribute significantly to environmental degradation and attenuation in the aquatic ecosystem. The results observed from the various naphthenic acids photodegradation processes, coupled with their low affinity for adsorption to soils, reveal that naphthenic acids are likely to persist in the water column. However, UV/vis radiation is capable of significantly changing the composition of mixtures in the aquatic ecosystem, but not reducing overall naphthenic acid concentrations. This may not be a beneficial as there is the potential for increased toxicity toward the lower molecular weight naphthenic acids...|$|R
