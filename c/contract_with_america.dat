5|$|Although congressional Republicans {{had opposed}} Clinton's Deficit Reduction Act of 1993, a key {{aspect of the}} 1994 <b>Contract</b> <b>with</b> <b>America</b> was {{the promise of a}} {{balanced}} federal budget. After the end of the government shutdown, Gingrich and other Republican leaders acknowledged that Congress {{would not be able to}} draft a balanced budget in 1996. Instead, they opted to approve some small reductions that were already approved by the White House and to wait until the next election season.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the first}} pieces of {{legislation}} passed by the new Congress under Gingrich was the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, which subjected members of Congress to the same laws that apply to businesses and their employees, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. As a provision of the <b>Contract</b> <b>with</b> <b>America,</b> the law was symbolic of the new Republican majority's goal to {{remove some of the}} entitlements enjoyed by Congress. The bill received near universal acceptance from the House and Senate and was signed into law on January 23, 1995.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy's role as {{a liberal}} lion in the Senate {{came to the fore}} in 1995, when the Republican Revolution took control and {{legislation}} intending to fulfill the <b>Contract</b> <b>with</b> <b>America</b> was coming from Newt Gingrich's House of Representatives. Many Democrats in the Senate and the country overall felt depressed but Kennedy rallied forces to combat the Republicans. By the beginning of 1996, the Republicans had overreached; most of the Contract had failed to pass the Senate and the Democrats could once again move forward with legislation, almost all of it coming out of Kennedy's staff.|$|E

5|$|In the 1994 {{campaign}} season, in {{an effort}} to offer an alternative to Democratic policies and to unite distant wings of the Republican Party, Gingrich and several other Republicans came up with a <b>Contract</b> <b>with</b> <b>America,</b> which laid out ten policies that Republicans promised to bring to a vote on the House floor during the first hundred days of the new Congress, if they won the election. The contract was signed by Gingrich and other Republican candidates for the House of Representatives. The contract ranged from issues such as welfare reform, term limits, tougher crime laws, and a balanced budget law, to more specialized legislation such as restrictions on American military participation in United Nations missions.|$|E
5|$|Kemp was {{considered}} {{the star of the}} 1992 Republican National Convention. In 1992 and 1993, Kemp {{was considered}} the favorite or co-favorite for the 1996 Presidential nomination. At the time of the 1994 mid-term elections, Kemp was widely anticipated to announce his candidacy for 1996, and his supporters wanted a formal announcement {{by the end of the}} year. In January 1995, Kemp's stated reason for not entering the 1996 Republican Party presidential primaries was that his personal beliefs were out of balance with the contemporary Republican political landscape: Kemp opposed term limits, he always preferred tax cuts to anything resembling a balanced budget amendment and, unlike most Republicans, favored federal incentives to combat urban poverty. In 1995, Gloria Borger noted Kemp was not in step with the 1994 <b>Contract</b> <b>with</b> <b>America.</b> Kemp also noted a distaste for the vast fundraising necessary for a Presidential campaign. Gergen stated that by 1996 the selection process had become so expensive, mean and personally invasive that it discouraged several top Republicans from running. In 1995, while the world awaited the campaign decision announcement by Colin Powell, Kemp had positive thoughts on the prospect of such a campaign.|$|E

25|$|In the House, Coburn {{earned a}} {{reputation}} as a political maverick due to his frequent battles with House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Most of these stand-offs stemmed from his belief that the Republican caucus was moving toward the political center and away from the more conservative <b>Contract</b> <b>With</b> <b>America</b> policy proposals that had brought the Republicans into power in Congress in 1994 {{for the first time in}} 40 years.|$|E

25|$|Gingrich {{generally}} favors policies {{intended to}} stimulate job growth through reductions in government regulations and federal taxes. In September 1994, Gingrich co-authored the <b>Contract</b> <b>With</b> <b>America,</b> {{which included the}} Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act.

25|$|In 1994, Republican Congressional {{candidates}} ran on {{a platform}} of major reforms of government with measures such as a balanced budget amendment and welfare reform. These measures and others formed the famous <b>Contract</b> <b>with</b> <b>America,</b> which represented the first effort to have a party platform in an off-year election.

25|$|Newt Gingrich has {{declared}} {{his position on}} many political issues through his public comments and legislative record, including as Speaker of the House. The political initiative with which he is most widely identified was the <b>Contract</b> <b>With</b> <b>America,</b> which outlined an economic and social agenda designed to improve the efficiency of government while reducing its burden on the American taxpayer.

His engagement of public issues has continued through to the present, in particular as the founder of American Solutions for Winning the Future.|$|E
25|$|As Congressman, Watts was {{assigned}} to the Armed Services Committee and the Financial Services Committee. Watts emphasized moral absolutes and was considered in line with Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich's agenda, the <b>Contract</b> <b>with</b> <b>America,</b> and at the time was the only African-American who did not join the Congressional Black Caucus. He initially supported ending affirmative action, declaring inadequate education the main obstacle for racial equality, but subsequently opposed legislation banning the practice for the federal government.

25|$|In the 1994 midterm elections, Republicans ran on a {{platform}} that included fiscal responsibility drafted by then-Congressman Newt Gingrich called the <b>Contract</b> <b>with</b> <b>America,</b> which advocated such things as balancing the budget, providing the president with a line-item veto, and welfare reform. After the elections gave the Republicans {{a majority in the}} House of Representatives, newly minted Speaker of the House Gingrich pushed aggressively for reduced government spending, which created a confrontation with the White House that climaxed in the 1995–1996 government shutdown. After Clinton's re-election in 1996, they were able to cooperate and pass the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which lowered the top capital gains tax rate from 28% to 20% and the 15% rate to 10%.|$|E

50|$|The Canadian Football League {{entered into}} a much more generous <b>contract</b> <b>with</b> the <b>America</b> One {{television}} network that had run from 2001 through 2009.

A number of factors led to America One not renewing their contract after the 2009 season. On July 1, 2010, NFL Network began airing live Canadian Football League games, again simulcasting TSN. This much more limited package did not include any games in August (during the NFL preseason), any playoff games, the Labour Day Classic (one of the Labour Day games was carried in 2011 but not the other), Thanksgiving Day Classic, or the Grey Cup.
