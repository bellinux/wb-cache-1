5|$|At an {{altitude}} of , Chard {{is one of the}} highest towns in Somerset, and is also the southernmost. The suburbs include: Crimchard, Furnham, Glynswood, Henson Park and Old Town. Local folklore claims that the town has a very unusual and unique feature, a stream running along either side of Fore Street. One stream eventually flows into the Bristol <b>Channel</b> <b>and</b> the other reaches the English Channel. This situation changed when the tributary of the Axe was diverted into the Isle; the gutter in Holyrood Street, though, still flows into the River Axe and therefore it is still true it lies on the watershed and that two gutters within the down eventually drain into the Bristol <b>Channel</b> <b>and</b> the English Channel.|$|E

40|$|Ion <b>channels</b> <b>and</b> receptors are the {{structural}} basis for neural signaling and transmission. Recently, {{the function of}} ion <b>channels</b> <b>and</b> receptors has been demonstrated to be modulated by many intracellular and extracellular chemicals and signaling molecules. Increasing evidence indicates that the complexity and plasticity of the function of central nervous system {{is determined by the}} modulation of ion <b>channels</b> <b>and</b> receptors. Among various mechanisms, Ca 2 + signaling pathways play important roles in neuronal activity and some pathological changes. Ca 2 + influx through ion <b>channels</b> <b>and</b> receptors can modulate its further influx in a feedback way or modulate other ion <b>channels</b> <b>and</b> receptors. The common feature of the modulation is that Ca 2 +/calmodulin (CaM) is the universal mediator. CaM maintains the coordination among ion channels/receptors and intracellular Ca 2 + homeostasis by feedback modulation of ion channels/receptors activity. This review focuses on the modulating processes of ion <b>channels</b> <b>and</b> receptors mediated by CaM, and further elucidates the mechanisms of Ca 2 + signaling...|$|R

5|$|The {{hospital}} ship , {{which had been}} sent out to rescue survivors from the sunken boats, was seized by the British for violating the Hague Convention rules {{on the use of}} {{hospital ship}}s. The loss of a squadron of German torpedo boats led to a drastic change in tactics in the English <b>Channel</b> <b>and</b> along the coast of Flanders. There were fewer sorties into the <b>Channel</b> <b>and</b> the torpedo boat force was relegated to coastal patrol and rescuing aircrew. The British received a bonus on 30 November, when a trawler pulled up the sealed chest thrown off S119 by Captain Thiele. The chest contained a German codebook used by the German light forces stationed on the coast, allowing the British to read German wireless communication for long afterwards.|$|E
