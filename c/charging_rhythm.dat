No poet could have invented the elements of poem; only a great poet could have used them so perfectly. Miss Dickinson was a deep mind writing from a deep culture, and when she came to poetry, she came infallibly.” ...|$|R

40|$|This paper grapples with a {{frequently}} asked question: Is there {{a case for}} poetry in Africa? Though not necessarily a polemical rooting for recognition of African oral poetry, the paper stands in contention with assertions that have tended to dismiss the said artworks as non-poetry, {{while at the same}} time attempting to confer superiority of the written poetry over the oral. In particular, the paper contests the arguments by some pioneer researchers into African literature that posited that what was usually touted as poetry in Africa did not qualify as true poetry, but rather, simply songs and chants. In an attempt to address the nitty-gritty of this subject the paper tackles the crucial question of what constitutes poetry and whether there is a significant difference between a song and a poem. The paper employs the theory of ethno-poetics which takes interest in the aesthetic components and poetic structuring of oral poems. Ethnopoetics gives guidelines on how to organize an oral text in lines to render its fullest <b>charge</b> of texture: <b>rhythm,</b> nuance, phrasing and other components that allow full poetic meaning. It is intended that the poetic restructuring will particularly help realize the poetic qualities in African poetic works. Besides, the paper also tries to popularize “narrato-centric” approach, an application we used earlier during a discussion on theory in the study of oral literature. The approach encourages the study of oral literature material that puts emphasis on performance and the dynamics dictating the performer and his role in the performance...|$|R
40|$|Reflections of the Seasons was {{inspired}} by pastoral scenes commonly depicted in Chinese poetry of the Tang Dynasty (618 - 907 C. E.). While living in Michigan, where the seasons have much more variation than my homeland of Taiwan, I became increasingly aware of the cycles of nature {{as a metaphor for}} the human condition. My work evokes the technique of the Tang poets using sounds to describe images associated with each season. 	The musical gestures in the first movement, Breaths of Autumn, portray the diverse appearances of falling leaves, different speeds of wind (at times stormy, at other moments gentle), and images of withered and yellowing grass. Changes in speed occur in several musical parameters from individual trills, changing phrase lengths, and flexible tempo shifts within the movement. These all mimic leaves being blown about. In addition, the random paths of leaves are reflected by wandering harmonies that lack direction. 	 	The second movement embodies my impression of the harsh Michigan winter. While the title, In Memory of…, most directly references memorial inscriptions on tombstones, by leaving the phrase incomplete I allow listeners to make their own subjective associations, inviting individual meditations on memory and loss. Suspended high chords in the strings, interrupted by short and fleeting gestures in the woodwinds and brass, create feelings of loneliness. Winter is a dark and sad season; the funeral march that follows leads the listeners along this road of human feeling present in the landscape. 	The cycle ends with In Praise of Life, a movement which corresponds to spring and summer. Upward musical gestures, <b>charged</b> and repetitive <b>rhythms,</b> as well as simplified ABA form create a strong sense of relief, energy, and the drive of growth and hope. While the movement comes to an emphatic close, many musical elements also suggest continuation. These include a constant musical pulse and rapid shifts in tonal center up to the final measures, and a metrically unstressed ending. These all suggest that while one season ends, another begins, and this evokes the eternal hope of life itself...|$|R
