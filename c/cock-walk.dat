40|$|Manganese (Mn) {{toxicity}} causes an extrapyramidal, parkinsonian-type {{movement disorder}} with characteristic magnetic resonance images of Mn accumulation in the basal ganglia. This letter highlights the neurological manifestations and neuroimaging features of inherited manganism (IMn), an unusual and treatable inborn error of Mn homeostasis. Early-onset dystonia with <b>cock-walk</b> gait and hyperintense signal in basal ganglia, associated to polycythemia, chronic liver disease and hypermanganesemia, promptly suggest IMn, and a genetic evaluation should be performed.
