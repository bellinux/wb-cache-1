50|$|Design {{features}} of the B and RB engines include 17 <b>capscrews</b> per cylinder head, a cylinder block that extends 3 in below the crankshaft centerline, an intake manifold not exposed to crankcase oil on the underside, stamped-steel shaft-mounted rocker arms (race versions used forged steel rockers), and a front-mounted external oil pump driven by the camshaft.|$|E
50|$|Related to parameters, but {{slightly}} different are constraints. Constraints are relationships between entities {{that make up}} a particular shape. For a window, the sides might be defined as being parallel, and of the same length. Parametric modeling is obvious and intuitive. But for the first three decades of CAD this was not the case. Modification meant re-draw, or add a new cut or protrusion on top of old ones. Dimensions on engineering drawings were created, instead of shown. Parametric modeling is very powerful, but requires more skill in model creation. A complicated model for an injection molded part may have a thousand features, and modifying an early feature may cause later features to fail. Skillfully created parametric models are easier to maintain and modify. Parametric modeling also lends itself to data re-use. A whole family of <b>capscrews</b> can be contained in one model, for example.|$|E
5000|$|The 428 Super Cobra Jet (also {{known as}} the 428SCJ) used the same top end, pistons, {{cylinder}} heads, camshaft, valve train, induction system, exhaust manifolds, and engine block as the 428 Cobra Jet. However, the crankshaft and connecting rods were strengthened and associated balancing altered for drag racing. A nodular iron crankshaft casting #1UA was used as well as heavier 427 [...] "Le Mans" [...] connecting rods with <b>capscrews</b> instead of bolts for greater durability. The heavier connecting rods {{and the removal of}} the centre counterweight on the stock 428 Cobra Jet crankshaft (1UA), required an external weight on the snout of the crankshaft for balancing. A 428 Super Cobra Jet engine with oil cooler was standard equipment when the [...] "Drag Pack" [...] option (which came when selecting either a 3.91 or 4.30 rear end gear ratio) was ordered with cars manufactured from 13 November 1968. In addition, while the CJ and SCJ engines used the same autothermic piston casting, the piston-to-bore clearance specification between the CJ and SCJ 428 engines is slightly different, with the SCJ engines gaining a slightly looser fit to permit higher operating temperature. Horsepower measurements at a street rpm level remained the same. The 428 Super Cobra Jet engine was never offered with factory air conditioning due to the location of its engine oil cooler.|$|E
50|$|A {{counterbore}} hole is usually used when {{the head of}} a fastener, such as a hex head or socket head <b>capscrew,</b> is required to be flush with or below the level of a workpieces surface.|$|R
25|$|A {{countersink}} is a conical hole {{cut into}} a manufactured object; a countersink bit (sometimes called simply countersink) is the cutter used to cut such a hole. A common use {{is to allow}} {{the head of a}} bolt or screw, with a shape exactly matching the countersunk hole, to sit flush with or {{below the surface of the}} surrounding material. (By comparison, a counterbore makes a flat-bottomed hole that might be used with a hex-headed <b>capscrew.)</b> A countersink may also be used to remove the burr left from a drilling or tapping operation.|$|R
50|$|A {{countersink}} (symbol: ‚åµ) is a conical hole {{cut into}} a manufactured object, or the cutter used to cut such a hole. A common use {{is to allow}} {{the head of a}} countersunk bolt or screw, when placed in the hole, to sit flush with or {{below the surface of the}} surrounding material (by comparison, a counterbore makes a flat-bottomed hole that might be used with a socket-head <b>capscrew).</b> A countersink may also be used to remove the burr left from a drilling or tapping operation thereby improving the finish of the product and removing any hazardous sharp edges.|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 47 The {{forces and}} moments {{stiffness}} criteria established by API- 610, Sixth Edition {{has resulted in}} a new generation of horizontal process pumps and baseplates, each with increased structural rigidity. Pictures and text explaining the structural modifications are presented along with equations for establishing the size of the integral pump feet and the hold-down <b>capscrews.</b> Supporting experimental stiffness test data for three sizes of Sixth Edition overhung process pump casing are illustrated graphically. A computer generated pedestal selection chart is presented as a means of optimizing the design of the pump support pedestal assembly which must accommodate casing thermal expansion and Sixth Edition stiffness requirements...|$|E
2500|$|The 428 CJ was {{no longer}} the top engine choice; the {{ultimate}} engine option was the 428-4V Super Cobra Jet (SCJ). This engine was specifically designed for drag racing, and the option package was referred to as the [...] "Drag Pack." [...] This engine option could be ordered with the Q-code 428-4V or the R-code 'Ram Air' equipped 428-4V. Included with 428 SCJ were cast pistons, a nodular controlled cast-iron crankshaft casting 1UA or 1UA B with an external weight on the snout behind the balancer, 427 (LeMans) <b>capscrew</b> connecting rods, an engine oil cooler, and either a [...] rear axle with 3.91:1 gears and a Traction-Lock limited slip or 4.30:1 gears with a Detroit Locker. The Detroit Locker and the oil cooler were industry exclusives to Ford. This package did not change Ford's advertised power rating of [...]|$|R
