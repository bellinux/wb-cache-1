Francoise <b>Carron.</b> It was Prince Sadruddin's and Princess Catherine's wish that their remains be buried in Muslim soil in Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Many {{countries}} in Europe use pure or hydrogenated rapeseed oil for deep-frying. The deep-fried Mars bar originated in Scotland, with The <b>Carron</b> Fish Bar in Stonehaven {{claiming to have}} invented it in the early 1990s. Fish and chips is a very popular deep-fried dish in England since it originated in London in the 19th century and became popular among the working class. Its popularity continues with 229 million portions of fish and chips being sold annually in England.|$|E
5|$|On 31 July, {{the hunger}} strike began to break, {{when the mother}} of Paddy Quinn insisted on medical {{intervention}} to save his life. The following day Kevin Lynch died, followed by Kieran Doherty on 2 August, Thomas McElwee on 8 August and Michael Devine on 20 August. On the day Devine died, Sands' election agent Owen <b>Carron</b> won the Fermanagh and South Tyrone by-election with an increased number of votes.|$|E
5|$|In 1869 {{the island}} was visited by a {{magistrate}} P. Cloete aboard the Thetis investigating a possible murder. He was accompanied by Charles Moore, director of the Botanic Gardens in Sydney, and his assistant William <b>Carron</b> who forwarded plant specimens to Ferdinand Mueller at the botanic gardens in Melbourne who, by 1875, had catalogued and published 195 species. Also on the ship was William Fitzgerald, a surveyor, and Mr Masters from the Australian Museum. Together they surveyed the island with the findings published in 1870 when the population was listed as 35 people, their 13 houses built of split palm battens thatched {{on the roof and}} sides with palm leaves. At about this time there began a downturn of trade with the demise of the whaling industry and sometimes six or twelve months passed without a vessel calling. With the provisions rotting in the storehouses the older families lost interest in market gardening.|$|E
5|$|As in England, {{commissions}} of new statuary {{tended to}} be made in relatively cheap lead and even more economical painted or gilded plaster. The plasterwork of John Cheere's yard in London was particularly in demand. Also important was the work from the yard of John Bacon (1740–99) who produced a monument for Robert Dundas (d. 1787) at Borthwick Church and one for Mrs Allardyce (d. 1787) at West Church, Aberdeen. Bacon was also a partner in Mrs Eleanor Coade's Artificial Stone Manufactory at Lambeth in London. This produced a buff coloured ceramic that could be moulded to provide fine detail, and be fired in sections, but was impervious to frost and fire. Much cheaper than carved stone, Coade stone was used for sphinxes, balustrading, capitals, coat of arms, tablets, ornamental vases, church monuments and fonts. It was used extensively by the Adam brothers, particularly in the houses they built in Scotland, such as Cullen, Banff, Culzean Castle, Ayrshire, Dunbar Castle, East Lothian, Register House, Edinburgh, Gosford House, East Lothian and Wedderburn, Berwickshire. As well as supplying sculpture, candelabra and cippi, the Adam family supplied designs to the <b>Carron</b> Company, founded in 1759, which produced a wide range of iron products, including stoves, safes, vases and tablets.|$|E
25|$|<b>Carron</b> {{made several}} voyages for the EIC.|$|E
25|$|Larbert's later {{growth is}} tied to the {{industrial}} development in the village itself as well as the wider parish. The pivotal event was the opening of the <b>Carron</b> Iron Works to the east of Stenhousemuir, in 1759, which produced a range of cast-iron goods and the Carronade, a naval cannon. The development of the iron works shifted the centre of the parish eastwards as people moved to closer to the <b>Carron</b> Ironworks for employment.|$|E
25|$|Falkirk {{is located}} {{in an area of}} undulating {{topography}} between the Slamannan Plateau and {{the upper reaches of the}} Firth of Forth. The area to the north of Falkirk is part of the floodplain of the River <b>Carron.</b> Two tributaries of the River <b>Carron</b> - the East Burn and the West Burn flow through the town and form part of its natural drainage system. Falkirk sits at between 50metres (164ft) and 125metres (410ft) above sea level.|$|E
25|$|In Glasgow John Craig led around 30 men to {{make for}} the <b>Carron</b> Company {{ironworks}} in Falkirk, Stirlingshire, telling them that weapons would {{be there for the}} taking, but the group scattered when intercepted by a police patrol. By coincidence a detachment of Hussars was waiting in ambush with the intention of catching men marching off from Glasgow to <b>Carron,</b> but was disappointed. Craig was caught, brought before a magistrate and fined, but the magistrate paid his fine for him.|$|E
25|$|William Forbes of Callendar - the {{proprietor}} of <b>Carron</b> Iron Works, was the largest landowner in Stirlingshire, and was seated in the centre of Falkirk at Callendar House.|$|E
25|$|The {{lands to}} the south of Larbert and Camelon, in the area traversed by the Antonine Wall, were {{strategically}} important to the Romans. The crossing point on the River <b>Carron</b> at Larbert was an important transportation route for the Romans on the road they constructed from Watling Lodge on the Antonine Wall to Stirling. Early Ordnance Survey maps showed Larbert located on an old Roman Road between Camelon and Stirling, with the site of a Roman camp close by. An early Christian community, with a chapel, is believed to have existed close to the crossing point on the <b>Carron</b> around 1160.|$|E
25|$|<b>Carron</b> was {{admitted}} to the Registry in Great Britain on 23 November 1796. Simpson received a letter of marque on 25 November. He then sailed for China and Bengal on 27 November.|$|E
25|$|Six of {{the vessels}} {{originally}} ordered 25 March 1823 were swiftly re-ordered as paddle steamers in May 1824 – Alban and <b>Carron</b> (both at Deptford), Columbia, Confiance, Dee and Echo (all four at Woolwich).|$|E
25|$|In 1799 Simpson sailed from China for Britain. <b>Carron</b> was at Lintin on 9 February 1799, and at Malacca on 22 February. She reached St Helena on 11 May, {{and arrived}} at The Downs in July.|$|E
25|$|The town {{is at the}} {{junction}} of the Forth and Clyde and Union Canals, a location which proved key to it's growth as a centre of heavy industry during the Industrial Revolution. In {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} centuries, Falkirk was at the centre of the iron and steel industry, underpinned by the <b>Carron</b> Company in nearby <b>Carron.</b> The company was responsible for making carronades for the Royal Navy and later manufactured pillar boxes. Within the last fifty years, heavy industry has waned, and the economy relies increasingly on retail and tourism. Despite this, Falkirk remains the home of many international companies like Alexander Dennis; the largest bus production company in the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|The K1 and {{the later}} K3 {{concrete}} kiosks were produced at various (and largely unrecorded) locations, around the country. This made quality control and {{supervision of the}} manufacturing process difficult, {{when compared to the}} GPO's experience with cast-iron posting boxes, and was an important aspect of the GPO's move towards cast-iron telephone kiosks. Over the years, five foundries were involved in this work for the Post Office. Lion Foundry in Kirkintilloch, MacFarlane (Saracen Foundry), and <b>Carron</b> Ironworks near Falkirk all produced batches of the K2, the K6 and the K8; and, in addition, <b>Carron</b> produced the single batch of K4 kiosks. The other two manufacturers were McDowall Steven and Bratt Colbran, both of which produced only relatively small batches of the pre-War Mk1 K6.|$|E
25|$|On 14 February 1804 <b>Carron</b> {{was one of}} 11 country ships {{present at}} the Battle of Pulo Aura, though she took no part in the engagement. She, {{like the rest of}} the {{flotilla}} of East Indiamen and country ships, was coming back from China.|$|E
25|$|She left England on 15 February 1800 for the Cape and Bengal, {{carrying}} a cargo for the British government. When she left England {{she was in}} company with <b>Carron,</b> Scaleby Castle, and Minerva. She left Fort St George for Bengal on 4 September 1800.|$|E
25|$|In 1795 Captain Francis Simpson sailed from Bengal for China, {{and then}} for Britain. <b>Carron</b> was at Whampoa on 24 November 1795, crossed the Second Bar on 11 January 1796, and left China on 15 February. She reached Saint Helena on 5 May, and arrived at Long Reach on 8 August.|$|E
25|$|Strome Castle, on {{the shore}} of Loch <b>Carron,</b> Ross-shire, was held in the early 16th century by Hector Munro, I of Erribol who was Governor of the castle on behalf of the Clan MacDonell of Glengarry who were then in {{possession}} of it, and he also married the daughter of the Glengarry chief.|$|E
25|$|From Stockingfield Junction {{the canal}} path runs north east, through Bishopbriggs, Kirkintilloch and Kilsyth, to Falkirk where the Forth & Clyde Canal joins with the Union Canal. A {{branch of the}} Forth & Clyde Canal runs from Falkirk to the River <b>Carron,</b> near Grangemouth. This branch {{is not part of}} the path.|$|E
25|$|From December 1813 onwards, she {{was under}} Commander John Brand Umfreville. In September 1814, she {{took part in the}} first, {{unsuccessful}} attack on Fort Bowyer. For much of the autumn, <b>Carron</b> was at Pensacola, until General Andrew Jackson's numerically superior forces expelled the British in the battle of Pensacola at the start of November 1814.|$|E
25|$|The lower slopes on the SE {{side of the}} {{mountain}} are composed of ice polished slabs dotted with long flowing mounds of debris, this is fluted moraine, deposited from a glacier, the mounds are less than four metres in height but up to 400 metres in length. The mountains visual attraction is further added to by the presence of four small lochs around its NE flanks, they are all on different levels. One of these lochs, Loch a’ Mhadaidh Ruadh, is rated {{as one of the most}} beautiful in the Scottish Highlands, it is located on the Bealach a’ Choire Ghairbh and is enclosed by walls of quartzite rock, giving it an almost artificial look. All drainage from {{the mountain}} makes the short journey to the west coast of Scotland, either going directly west to Upper Loch Torridon or SE to Glen <b>Carron</b> and then Loch <b>Carron.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Carron</b> was {{launched}} at Bombay Dockyard in July 1792. She was a country ship that made several voyages for the British East India Company (EIC) before the Royal Navy purchased her in 1804 {{to use as}} a fifth-rate frigate, and renamed Duncan. In 1807 the Navy renamed her Dover. She was wrecked off Madras on 2 May 1811.|$|E
25|$|He married, on 7 December 1929 (civil), in Aix-les-Bains, France, and 13 December 1929 (religious), in Bombay, India, Andrée Joséphine <b>Carron</b> (1898–1976). A {{co-owner}} of a dressmaking shop in Paris, she {{became known as}} Princess Andrée Aga Khan. By this marriage, he had one son, Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan (1933–2003). The couple were divorced in 1943.|$|E
25|$|Most {{residents}} of Larbert {{work outside the}} town. Historically, the <b>Carron</b> Company, which developed east of Stenhousemuir, was a major employer. More recently, the bus builder Alexander-Dennis Coachbuilders, which has a large works at Camelon, has employed Larbert residents. Larbert sits in the travel to work area for both Edinburgh and Glasgow, with many residents commuting to work there daily.|$|E
25|$|But family use of {{the house}} declined, as income from the mines and port increased. In the late 18th century, Dr John Roebuck, founder of the <b>Carron</b> Iron Works lived at Kinneil House, during which time the {{engineer}} James Watt worked at perfecting his steam engine, in a cottage adjacent to the house. Between 1809 and 1828 the 9th Duke gave the philosopher Dugald Stewart {{use of the}} house.|$|E
25|$|In May 1945, she {{was seized}} {{as a war}} prize and passed to the MoWT. Repairs were {{completed}} in 1947 and she was renamed Empire <b>Carron.</b> The United Kingdom Official Number 181642 was allocated. She was then sold to S G Empiricos Ltd, London and renamed Andrian. In 1949, Andrian was sold to Compagnia Navigazione Yaviza, Panama and renamed San Nicolas. She served until 1964, arriving at Spezia, Italy in December 1964 for scrapping.|$|E
25|$|The media {{coverage}} {{that surrounded the}} death of Sands resulted in a new surge of IRA activity and an immediate escalation in the Troubles, with the group obtaining many more members and increasing its fund-raising capability. Both nationalists and unionists began to harden their attitudes and move towards political extremes. Sands's Westminster seat was taken by his election agent, Owen <b>Carron</b> standing as 'Anti H-Block Proxy Political Prisoner' with an increased majority.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrival of}} the tram in October 1905 {{improved}} transport between Larbert {{and many of its}} surrounding neighbours. The service followed a circular route through Larbert, Stenhousemuir, past the <b>Carron</b> Iron Works, through Bainsford and to Falkirk. Larbert's new closeness to surrounding communities raised concerns about the loss of village independence. A consortium of local industrialists and residents, fearing higher burgh rates, successfully resisted a 1912 proposal to incorporate nearby villages such as Larbert and Stenhousemuir into the larger town of Falkirk.|$|E
25|$|On {{the next}} day, Tuesday 4 April, Duncan Turner {{assembled}} around 60 men to march to <b>Carron,</b> while he carried out organising work elsewhere. Half the group dropped out, the rest accepted his assurances {{that they would}} pick up supporters along the way. Their leader Andrew Hardie was given a torn half card to be matched with the other half {{in the possession of}} a supporter in Condorrat, on the way to <b>Carron.</b> There, John Baird was visited around 11 p.m. by John King, who gave him the other half card. At around 5 a.m. on 5 April Hardie arrived with 25 men, soaked through. Baird had expected a small army, but King urged them on, saying he would go on ahead to rally supporters. One of the men named Kean went with him, and Baird and Hardie set off with a total of 30 men. On the way they twice came across travellers, but let them go. The travellers passed the information on to authorities at Kilsyth and Stirling Castle. King arrived again, though Kean was not with him. and told them that he had instructions that he had to go quickly to find supporters at Camelon, while Baird and Hardie were to leave the road and wait at Bonnymuir.|$|E
25|$|Scotland's heavy {{industry}} {{began to develop}} {{in the second half}} of the 18th century. The <b>Carron</b> Company established its ironworks at Falkirk in 1759, initially using imported ore but later using locally sourced Ironstone. The iron industry expanded tenfold between 1830 and 1844. The shipbuilding industry on the River Clyde increased greatly from the 1840s and by 1870 the Clyde was producing more than half of Britain's tonnage of shipping. The heavy industries based around shipbuilding and locomotives went into severe decline after World War II.|$|E
25|$|The battle {{began with}} the Americans repulsing the British land attack on 14 September. Nicolls, ill at the time, was observing on Hermes. On 15 September, after {{contrary}} winds had died down, Percy crossed the bar with Hermes, Sophie, <b>Carron,</b> and Childers. The fort opened fire at 3:20p.m. and at 3:30 Hermes opened fire. The U.S. fort and Hermes were at musket-shot range. At 3:40, Sophie opened fire also, but the other two vessels {{were not able to}} get into a firing position. During the battle, a wooden splinter wounded Nicolls in the eye.|$|E
25|$|The fell has {{no obvious}} {{connecting}} ridges {{in the manner}} of higher mountains, but in fact has a pivotal position in this area of the district. To the west over Oxen Fell High Cross (518ft) is Holme Fell and an onward link to Wetherlam and the Furness Fells (Coniston Fells). To the south east a broad highland runs out between Windermere and Esthwaite Water, terminating in Claife Heights. Finally southward runs the 7 mile ridge of Grizedale Forest, capped by <b>Carron</b> Crag and Top o'Selside, Black Fell's topographical parent.|$|E
25|$|The {{township}} of Croydon, {{which emerged}} as the social, administrative and commercial centre of the field, was declared a municipality in 1892, {{under the control of}} the Croydon Divisional Board. In 1907, administration passed to the Croydon Shire Council. From the mid-1880s satellite communities were established at many of the outlying reefs, with townships being formed at Golden Gate, Tabletop, Gorge Creek, Golden Valley, Goldstone, <b>Carron</b> and Twelve Mile, and campsites at Homeward Bound, Croydon King, Mark Twain, Lower Twelve Mile, Mulligan's, Flanagan's, Morning Light, Moonstone and Alluvial Springs.|$|E
25|$|At the {{southern}} tip of the village, the Dorrator Iron Bridge used to span a meander in the River <b>Carron</b> until it was dismantled and replaced with a new bridge adjacent to the surviving pillar {{on the west side of}} the river, connecting Larbert with the neighbouring settlement of Camelon. The bridge was constructed in 1893 on the site of a ford, which could rarely be used when the river was in full flow. The bridge is reached via a footpath leading from the bottom of Carronvale Road in Larbert.|$|E
