5|$|Later, upon {{visiting the}} grave of Graves, Mulder and Scully learn of his suicide {{and the death of}} his {{daughter}} at a young age, a daughter who would be Lauren's age were she still alive. Scully suspects that Graves faked his death, but on consulting the pathologist who examined his body and testing the organs he donated to others it is proved that he indeed died. Lauren meanwhile witnesses a vision at night, including blood appearing in the bathtub, that leads her to believe that Graves was murdered. At her going-away party, Lauren is threatened by Dorlund, who believes she has knowledge of confidential information that could implicate him. Lauren calls Mulder and Scully to her home, but before the agents <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>there,</b> two assassins hired by Dorlund arrive to kill her. An invisible force kills both of them, just as Mulder and Scully arrive (with Mulder witnessing the body of one of the assassins being hanged in midair).|$|E

500|$|After Val and Eric foster Amy, {{she starts}} acting rebellious again. She starts {{drinking}} and throwing herself at men, forcing her foster parents to have second thoughts. Halfpenny told Inside Soap that Amy goes off the rails {{because she is}} convinced everything goes wrong in her life. [...] "She's afraid of getting hurt, so she spoils things for herself before anyone else <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>there</b> first." [...] Halfpenny explained that Val's parental approach compared to Eric's was contrasting. Eric had not been around when his son David Metcalfe (Matthew Wolfenden) grew up, Halfpenny said this factor meant that Eric is not tolerant with Amy's bad behaviour. Though, Val had brought up her own children, her approach towards Amy is [...] "light-hearted." [...] However, when Amy continues her alcohol binges, Val and Eric feel she has [...] "gone too far" [...] and [...] "question their {{ability to cope with}} her." [...] Served with an ultimatum, Amy has to endure changes to remain with her new family. Halfpenny claimed the main change she had to make was [...] "to keep her tongue in her own mouth and cool it down with the boys." ...|$|E

500|$|Jet {{learns that}} {{the truck was}} the {{property}} of Cherious Medical Pharmaceutical Company, who illegally manufactured the pathogen as a biological weapon. Looking {{for information on the}} pathogen, Spike is given a sample by a man named Rashid, who was the former lead on its development. Spike also encounters Elektra Ovilo, an agent of Cherious Medical. Upon examination, the [...] "pathogen" [...] proves to be a type of protein-based nanomachine that mimics human lymphocytes then breaks down into protein after death, making it undetectable. Attempting to infiltrate Cherious Medical, Spike fights with Elektra, planting a listening device on her. Elektra, who is sent by Cherious Medical to kill Vincent, is tailed by Spike, who attempts to take down Vincent on a train. Vincent easily defeats Spike, severely wounding him and throwing him from the train before releasing another cloud of the nanomachines: everyone in the train dies except Elektra, who was unknowingly immunized when she had been in a relationship with Vincent prior to the test on Titan. She secretly gives a friend in the company a sample of her blood to prepare a stock of vaccine. During this time, Faye relocates Sampson, who has been working with Vincent, but fails to catch him. Ein and Ed manage to find him again, but the two run off before Faye <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>there.</b> She arrives just as Vincent breaks one of the nanomachine containers with him, killing Sampson. Although Faye is also infected, Vincent gives her some of his blood through a kiss, immunizing her.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2008, Switchfoot {{moved into}} their new studio which they called Spot X, and {{recording}} {{for the record}} was {{kicked into high gear}} in June, with the band proceeding without a producer.

Progress was halted briefly when the band embarked on the Music Builds Tour in August, but was resumed soon after.|$|E

2500|$|Twilight frets how {{to escape}} the trap in time before realizing that the only {{solution}} is to have Spike deliver the Heart to the ponies below, even though she believes this will cause her to fail her test to Celestia. Spike races ahead of King Sombra's attacks, but falls off with the Heart. Shining Armor throws Cadance at Spike and the Heart; she catches both in time before King Sombra <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>there,</b> and glides down {{to the base of}} the castle, the Crystal Heart restoring both her strength and magic. Quickly placing the Heart in its proper place, Cadance addresses the Crystal Ponies as their princess and instructs them to power the Heart. The positive feelings from the ponies cause the Heart to be recharged, and King Sombra shatters, causing him to explode [...] With the Heart restored, the Crystal ponies regain their crystalline appearance, and the effect extends to Princess Cadance, Shining Armor, and Twilight and her friends, while they remain in the city.|$|E
2500|$|... "Transportation {{determines the}} flow of population," [...] {{declared}} J. D. Spreckels, one of California's early railroad entrepreneurs, just after {{the dawn of the}} twentieth century. [...] "Before you can hope to get people to live anywhere...you must first of all show them that they <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>there</b> quickly, comfortably and, above all, cheaply." [...] Among Spreckels' many accomplishments was the formation of the San Diego Electric Railway in 1892, which radiated out from downtown to points north, south, and east and helped urbanize San Diego. Henry Huntington, the nephew of Central Pacific founder Collis P. Huntington, would develop his Pacific Electric Railway in Los Angeles and Orange Counties with much the same result. Spreckels' greatest challenge would be to provide San Diego with its own direct transcontinental rail link {{in the form of the}} San Diego and Arizona Railway (completed in November 1919), a feat that nearly cost the sugar heir his life. The Central Pacific Railroad, in effect, initiated the trend by offering settlement incentives in the form of low fares, and by placing sections of its government-granted lands up for sale to pioneers.|$|E
