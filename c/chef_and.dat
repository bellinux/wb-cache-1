40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{differences}} between the private and public discourses associated with cooks <b>and</b> <b>chefs</b> <b>and</b> the identities that are formed by these discourses. Academic literature and memoirs were reviewed to analyze the private discourse created among cooks <b>and</b> <b>chefs</b> that form their identities. Media articles and two movies were reviewed to analyze the public discourses that form the larger social identities of cooks <b>and</b> <b>chefs.</b> Embracing Fairhurst <b>and</b> Putnam’s (2004) conceptualization of “discourse” as local talk and texts and “Discoruse” as large scale systems of meaning, I conceptualized private discourse as local talk among cooks <b>and</b> <b>chefs</b> <b>and</b> public “Discourse” as larger meanings about cooks <b>and</b> <b>chefs.</b> Taking a becoming orientation to discourse and embracing a Foucauldian power/knowledge lens, I analyze discourses about and among cooks <b>and</b> <b>chefs</b> to explore their emergent identities. This analysis reveals that the public discourse surrounding the identity of cooks <b>and</b> <b>chefs</b> is oppressive <b>and</b> potentially limits the ways they can engage in necessary discourse to create their own identities...|$|R

5|$|To {{underscore}} {{that the}} feast represents an exotic bygone world of pre-partition Poland, Mickiewicz {{added to this}} a list of random dishes, ingredients and additives, whose names he found in Compendium ferculorum and which had already been forgotten in his own time: kontuza (soup of boiled and sieved meat), arkas (sweet milk-based jelly), blemas (blancmange), pomuchla (Atlantic cod), figatele (meatballs), cybeta (civet), piżmo (musk), dragant (tragacanth), pinele (pine nuts) and brunele (prunes). This {{is followed by a}} similar enumeration of various kinds of fish, whose names are likewise taken from the inventory at the beginning of Czerniecki's book. A description of a white-apron-clad <b>chef</b> <b>and</b> a reference to Prince Ossoliński's banquet in Rome, both found in Book 11, are also clearly inspired by Czerniecki's characterization of a master <b>chef</b> <b>and</b> his dedication, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Deighton {{authored}} two television scripts, {{the first}} of which was Long Past Glory in 1963; he also wrote a film script, Oh! What a Lovely War (1969). His long-held interest in cooking—his mother had been a professional <b>chef</b> <b>and</b> instilled a love for cuisine in her son—led to an illustrated cookery column in the Sunday newspaper, The Observer, for two years. The work was collected into two later books, Len Deighton's Action Cookbook and Où est le garlic (both 1965); he subsequently wrote several other cookery books. Deighton has produced several other works of non-fiction, including a study of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, a history of the airship, Second World War military history and a short e-book about James Bond.|$|E

5|$|Following a {{fall-out}} between Ramsay and A-Z Restaurants over Wareing's contract at L'Oranger, {{which saw}} Ramsay quit Aubergine to open Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, Wareing followed suit by leaving L'Oranger, forcing the restaurant into temporary closure. A-Z Restaurants commenced legal proceedings against the pair, and reopened L’Oranger with Wareing's former sous chef, Kamel Benamar, {{as the new}} head chef. The legal case ended in Ramsay and Wareing paying an out-of-court settlement to the Restaurant group. Ramsay and Wareing worked together to open Pétrus in 1999, with Wareing becoming head <b>chef</b> <b>and</b> operating the restaurant on behalf of Gordon Ramsay Holdings (GRH), at 33 St James's Street, London. The name came from the French wine Pétrus, which was Ramsay's and Wareing's favourite. Wareing promptly regained the Michelin star he had previously held, with Pétrus being named as a one star restaurant seven months after opening.|$|E
5|$|Julian Carlton was a 31-year-old man {{who came}} {{to work as a}} <b>chef</b> <b>and</b> servant at Taliesin for the summer. Carlton was an Afro-Caribbean of West Indian descent, ostensibly from Barbados. He was {{recommended}} to Wright by John Vogelsong, Jr., the caterer for the Midway Gardens project. Carlton and his wife Gertrude had previously served in the house of Vogelsong's parents in Chicago. Originally a genial presence on the estate, Carlton grew increasingly paranoid. He stayed up late at night with a butcher knife, looking out the window. This behavior had been noticed by Wright and Borthwick, who issued an ad in a local paper for a replacement cook. Carlton was given notice that August 15, 1914 would be his last day in their employ.|$|E
5|$|Michel's {{older brother}} Albert had already become a patissier (pastry <b>chef),</b> <b>and</b> Roux {{followed}} him into this field {{at the age of}} fourteen. He became an apprentice to Camille Loyal in Belleville, working seventy-hour weeks. Michel's tasks at the pâtisserie included making up to sixty Galette des Rois over the course of three days for Epiphany. Albert found Michel further employment as his apprenticeship ended. As Albert was working at the British Embassy in Paris as a sous chef, Michel joined him there as the pastry chef for the Embassy. He moved on from there to become a chef in Philippe de Rothschild's service, while Albert moved to England to work there. Between 1960 and 1962, Michel served his French National Service. He was first stationed at the Palace of Versailles, but was later posted overseas in Béchar, Algeria. He was awarded the Médaille commémorative des opérations de sécurité et de maintien de l'ordre en Afrique du Nord.|$|E
