50|$|In {{the early}} 1730s, again {{faced with a}} {{shortage}} of specie and letters of exchange, the Count of Maurepas recommended applying a card money system, {{similar to the one}} then in use in Canada, in French Louisiana. This was intended for domestic trade, without any mark-up, and to be backed through letters of exchange. On 14 September 1735, the French Crown approved an issue of card money up to 200,000 livres, with a quota of 150,000 livres for letters of exchange. Cards were prepared and signed by the Crown's comptroller in Louisiana, with higher denominations requiring the <b>countersignatures</b> of the governor and ordonnateur. For the next two years the value of the card money remained stable, sustained by ordonnateur Edmé Gatien Salmon's issuance of letters of exchange in excess of the quota. By 1739, however, value of the card money had decreased, as attempts to redeem the cards for letters of exchange went unfilled. The colony was incurring great expenses during their war with the Chickasaw, and - with the French government unwilling to increase the quota for letters of exchange - by 1741 Salmon was already drawing on his quota for 1744. This shortage, and resulting inflation, meant that by 1743 the card money was essentially worthless. In 1745, with war still ongoing, the card money and other paper issued by the colony was burned; before liquidization, notes were exchanged for letters of exchange at two fifths of face value.|$|R

500|$|Executive power, {{according}} to ArticleV and ArticleVII, {{was in the}} hands of [...] "the king in his council", a cabinet of ministers called the Guardians of the Laws (or Guard of the Laws, Straż Praw). The ministries could not create or interpret the laws and all acts of the foreign ministry were provisional and subject to the Sejm's approval. The king presided over this council, which was composed of the Roman Catholic Primate of Polandwho was also president of the Education Commissionand five ministers appointed by the king: a minister of police, a minister of the seal (internal affairs), a minister of foreign affairs, a minister belli (of war), and a minister of treasury. Council members also includedwithout a votethe Crown Prince, the Marshal of the Sejm, and two secretaries. This royal council descended from similar councils that had functioned since King Henry's Articles (1573), and from the recent Permanent Council. Acts of the king required the <b>countersignature</b> of the respective minister. A minister was required to cosign a law if the king demanded it, unless that minister refused and all other ministers unanimously endorsed his objection, in which case the king could withdraw the law or press the issue by taking it before the parliament. The stipulation that the king, [...] "doing nothing of himself,... shall be answerable for nothing to the nation," [...] parallels the British constitutional principle that [...] "The king can do no wrong." [...] (In both countries, the respective minister was responsible for the king's acts.) The ministers were responsible to the Sejm, which could dismiss them by a vote of no confidence with a two-third majority in both houses. Ministers could be also held accountable by the Sejm court, and a simple majority vote was sufficient for the Sejm to demand that a minister face an impeachment trial. The king was the nation's commander-in-chief, commanding its armies; the institution of the hetman (high-ranking military official) was not mentioned. The king also had the right to grant pardon except in cases of treason. The decisions of the royal council were carried out by commissions, including the previously created Commission of National Education, and the new Commissions for Police, the Military and the Treasury, whose members were elected by the Sejm.|$|E
