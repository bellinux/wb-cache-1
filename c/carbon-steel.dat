5000|$|Carbon steel: An alloy of {{iron and}} {{approximately}} 1% carbon. Most carbon steel chef's knives are simple carbon iron alloys without exotic additions such as chrome or vanadium. Carbon steel blades are both easier to sharpen than ordinary stainless steel and usually hold an edge longer, but are vulnerable to rust and stains. Some professional cooks swear by knives of carbon steel because of their sharpness. Over time, a <b>carbon-steel</b> knife will normally acquire a dark patina, and can rust or corrode if not cared for properly by cleaning and lubricating the blade after use. Some chefs also 'rest' their <b>carbon-steel</b> knives for a day after use in order to restore the oxidizing patina, which prevents transfer of metallic tastes to some foods. While some cooks prefer and use carbon steel knives (especially in Asia and the Middle East), others find carbon steel too maintenance-intensive in a kitchen environment.|$|E
50|$|Most {{alloying}} elements (solutes) {{have the benefit}} of not only increasing hardness, but also lowering both the martensite start temperature and the temperature at which austenite transforms into ferrite and cementite. During quenching, this allows a slower cooling rate, which allows items with thicker cross-sections to be hardened to greater depths than is possible in plain <b>carbon-steel,</b> producing more uniformity in strength.|$|E

5000|$|Professional Japanese cooks usually {{own their}} {{personal}} set of knives, {{which are not}} used by other cooks.

50|$|Tempering {{methods for}} alloy steels may vary considerably, {{depending}} on the type and amount of elements added. In general, elements like manganese, nickel, silicon, and aluminum will remain dissolved in the ferrite during tempering while the carbon precipitates. When quenched, these solutes will usually produce an increase in hardness over plain <b>carbon-steel</b> of the same carbon content. When hardened alloy-steels, containing moderate amounts of these elements, are tempered, the alloy will usually soften somewhat proportionately to carbon steel.|$|E

50|$|The {{transition}} from the martensite phase to the austenite phase is only dependent on temperature and stress, not time, as most phase changes are, {{as there is no}} diffusion involved. Similarly, the austenite structure receives its name from steel alloys of a similar structure. It is the reversible diffusionless transition between these two phases that results in special properties. While martensite can be formed from austenite by rapidly cooling <b>carbon-steel,</b> this process is not reversible, so steel does not have shape-memory properties.|$|E

5000|$|Although most {{precipitation}} hardening alloys will harden at room temperature, some will only harden at elevated temperatures and, in others, {{the process can}} be sped up by aging at elevated temperatures. Aging at temperatures higher than room-temperature is called [...] "artificial aging". Although the method is similar to tempering, the term [...] "tempering" [...] is usually not used to describe artificial aging, because the physical processes, (i.e.: precipitation of intermetallic phases from a supersaturated alloy) the desired results, (i.e.: strengthening rather than softening), {{and the amount of}} time held at a certain temperature are very different from tempering as used in <b>carbon-steel.</b>|$|E
50|$|Two Pope employees, Henry Souther and Harold Hayden Eames, {{collaborated on}} a new process for {{producing}} bicycle tubing.

50|$|The {{slow but}} {{continuous}} production of hydrogen in deep low-permeability argillaceous formations could represent {{a problem for}} the long-term disposal of radioactive waste (Ortiz et al., 2001; Nagra, 2008; recent Nagra NTB reports).

5000|$|It was {{probably}} Harry Brearley’s upbringing in Sheffield, a city {{famous for the}} manufacture of cutlery since the 16th century, which led him to appreciate the potential of these new steels for applications not only in high-temperature service, as originally envisioned, {{but also in the}} mass-production of food-related applications such as cutlery, saucepans and processing equipment etc. Up to that time <b>carbon-steel</b> knives were prone to unhygienic rusting if they were not frequently polished and only expensive sterling silver or EPNS cutlery was generally available to avoid such problems.

5000|$|Carbon {{steel is}} an alloy {{of iron and}} carbon, often {{including}} other elements such as vanadium and manganese. Carbon steel commonly used in knives has around 1.0% carbon (ex. AISI 1095), is inexpensive, and holds its edge well. Carbon steel is normally easier to resharpen than most stainless steels, but is vulnerable to rust and stains. The blades should be cleaned, dried, and lubricated after each use and new <b>carbon-steel</b> knives may impart a metallic or [...] "iron" [...] flavour to acidic foods, though over time, the steel will acquire a patina of oxidation which will prevent corrosion.

50|$|Just as {{the culture}} was {{spreading}} outside New York City and overseas, the cultural aspect of graffiti in New York City {{was said to}} be deteriorating {{almost to the point of}} extinction. The rapid decline in writing was due to several factors. The streets became more dangerous due to the burgeoning crack epidemic, legislation was underway to make penalties for graffiti artists more severe, and restrictions on paint sale and display made racking (stealing) materials difficult. Above all, the MTA greatly increased their anti-graffiti budget. Many favored painting sites became heavily guarded, yards were patrolled, newer and better fences were erected, and buffing of pieces was strong, heavy, and consistent. Stainless steel, to which paint adheres poorly (and was easily removed by the powerful cleaning solutions and spinning brushes used in automatic car washers at the yards) had also become the car body material of choice for new rolling stock, retiring hundreds of worn out <b>carbon-steel</b> bodied subway cars whose exteriors had made an ideal canvas for taggers. As a result of rolling stock being harder to paint, more writers went into the streets, which is now, along with commuter trains and box cars, the most prevalent form of writing.|$|E
50|$|Induced-charge {{electrokinetics}} {{in physics}} is the electrically driven fluid flow and particle motion in a liquid electrolyte. Consider a metal particle (which is neutrally charged but electrically conducting) {{in contact with}} an aqueous solution in a chamber/channel. If different voltages apply {{to the end of}} this chamber/channel, electric field will generate in this chamber/channel. This applied electric field passes through this metal particle and causes the free charges inside the particle migrate under the skin of particle. As a result of this migration, the negative charges moves to the side which is close to the positive (or higher) voltage while the positive charges moves to {{the opposite side of the}} particle. These charges under the skin of conducting particle attract the counter-ions of the aqueous solution; thus, the electric double layer (EDL) forms around the particle. The EDL sing on the surface of the conducting particle changes from positive to negative and the distribution of the charges varies along the particle geometry. Due to these variations, the EDL is non-uniform and has different sings. Thus, the induced zeta potential around the particle, and consequently slip velocity on the surface of the particle, vary as a function of local electric field. Differences in magnitude and direction of slip velocity on the surface of the conducting particle effects the flow pattern around this particle and causes micro vortices. Yasaman Daghighi and Dongqing Li, for the first time, experimentally illustrated these induced vortices around a 1.2mm diameter <b>carbon-steel</b> sphere under the 40V/cm Direct Current (DC) external electric filed.Chenhui Peng et al. also experimentally showed the patterns of electro-osmotic flow around an Au sphere when Alternative Current (AC) is involved (E=10mV/μm, f=1 kHz).Electrokinetics here refers to a branch of science related to the motion and reaction of charged particles to the applied electric filed and its effects on its environment. It is sometimes referred as non-linear electrokinetic phenomena as well.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental investigation into end-plate beam column connections for buildings. The work demonstrates that a four-fold {{increase in the}} energy absorbed to failure {{can be achieved by}} replacing carbon steel bolts with their stainless steel counterparts. Experimental tests were carried out under load control and these provided the opportunity to observe the time required for connection fracture. Under quasi-static loading, connections tested with stainless steel bolts showed clearly visible signs of distress prior to failure; whereas the <b>carbon-steel</b> bolted equivalents provided no warning of failure prior to brittle fracture. Experimental tests were carried out on bolts and these showed strain rate induced strength enhancements. End-plate connections were also tested under high strain rates. Loading rate was not observed to significantly affect the performance of stainless steel bolted connections. However, <b>carbon-steel</b> bolted connections were observed to weaken under high strain rates, therefore dynamically increased material properties did not always translate into increase connection strength. The design strengths predicted using Eurocode 3 were found to be in good agreement with the experimentally observed values under quasi-static loading for both bolt types. Under high-strain rate conditions the Eurocode 3 method was also found to provide a good prediction for stainless steel bolted connections; but was found to over predict for <b>carbon-steel</b> connections. The simple modification of replacing <b>carbon-steel</b> bolts with their stainless steel equivalents is shown to be an effective way of improving the performance of industry standard connections. This modification is of relevance to the design of buildings and other structures in which the ductility is of high importance, for example in structures which may need to resist transient loads from blast or impact. <br/...|$|E
