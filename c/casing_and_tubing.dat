40|$|When {{producing}} hot fluid from a reservoir, {{the production}} well experiences changing temperatures with depth {{for the different}} <b>tubing,</b> <b>casing,</b> cement <b>and</b> wellbore interfaces. To what extent the temperatures change is depending on many factors. The production flow rate, produced fluid specific heat capacity, thermal conductivity and viscosity of the annular fluids, the Joule-Thomson effect on the produced fluid, radius of the wellbore, annular clearance, and production time, {{are some of the}} parameters playing an important role in determining the heat transfer across the wellbore between the produced fluid and the formation. A wellbore heat transfer model for a single phase oil production scenario, based on the wellbore heat transfer model presented by Hasan, Kabir, and Wang (2009), has been implemented in the MATLAB ® software. The model considers a fairly complex wellbore configuration, consisting of five wellbore sections of different configuration, with the possibility of natural/free convection taking place in three brine filled annulus. Correlations taking temperature and/or pressure into consideration has been implemented for all thermophysical properties in the wellbore, such as thermal conductivity of <b>tubing,</b> <b>casing,</b> <b>and</b> cement, specific heat capacity, viscosity, thermal conductivity of annular fluids, and densities of produced and annular fluids, to mention some. The MATLAB program allows for custom well configurations, and is able to calculate the temperatures at all the wellbore, <b>casings</b> <b>and</b> <b>tubing</b> interfaces, <b>and</b> has the ability to use other fluid, casing/tubing, cement and formation properties than the ones used in this study...|$|R

50|$|Often, gas is {{produced}} {{through the same}} perforations as the oil. This can be problematic if gas enters the pump, because it can result in {{what is known as}} gas locking, where insufficient pressure builds up in the pump barrel to open the valves (due to compression of the gas) and little or nothing is pumped. To preclude this, the inlet for the pump can be placed below the perforations. As the gas-laden fluid enters the well bore through the perforations, the gas bubbles up the annulus (the space between the <b>casing</b> <b>and</b> the <b>tubing)</b> while the liquid moves down to the standing valve inlet. Once at the surface, the gas is collected through piping connected to the annulus.|$|R
5000|$|Few wells {{actually}} produce through casing, since producing fluids can corrode {{steel or}} form deposits such as asphaltenes or paraffin waxes {{and the larger}} diameter can make flow unstable. Production tubing is therefore installed inside the last <b>casing</b> string <b>and</b> the <b>tubing</b> annulus is usually sealed {{at the bottom of}} the tubing by a packer. Tubing is easier to remove for maintenance, replacement, or for various types of workover operations. It is significantly lighter than <b>casing</b> <b>and</b> does not require a drilling rig to run in and out of hole; smaller [...] "service rigs" [...] are used for this purpose.|$|R

This study reviewed and assessed some of the inhibition techniques used in the industry with regard to handling oilfield scales in general and silicates scales in particular. Besides, the inhibitors with enhanced functionality in mitigating silicate scale also have been discussed. However, the conventional scale inhibitors used are facing restrictions world over, due to their ecotoxicity and non-biodegradability, which, therefore, has led to the call for green scale inhibition in the oil and industry. Green scale inhibitors are considered as alternative scale inhibitors due to their value-added benefits to the environment with respect to the methods of treating oilfield scales.|$|R
40|$|Downhole <b>casing</b> <b>and</b> <b>tubing</b> are {{subjected}} to corrosion in many cases because of the exposure to corrosive environment. A more serious problem is that pitting corrosion occurs in the casing inner surface. Meanwhile, downhole strings {{are subjected}} to various forms of mechanical loads, for example, internal pressure load, external collapse load, or both. These loads acting on the corrosion pits will cause stress concentration and degrade the casing strength. Thus, {{it is essential to}} evaluate the stress concentration degree reasonably. The SCF (stress concentration factor) is usually used to characterize the degree of stress concentration induced by corrosion pits. This paper presented a comparison on the SCFs regarding the analytical method for a single pit and experimental method for double pits. The results show that the SCF of a single pit depends mainly on the depth of the corrosion pit; however, the SCF of the double pits strongly depends on the pits distance.

A top-tensioned riser generally consists of outer casing, inner <b>casing</b> <b>and</b> <b>tubing.</b> The pipes are coupled either through fluids in the annuli or through intermediate guides (centralizers) or through both. This paper investigates the dynamic analysis for such an internally coupled fluid/ riser system. This paper first presents a theoretical formulation for a general riser system coupled with fluids in the annuli and centralizers between pipes. Hydrodynamic forces associated with the viscous fluid in between concentric cylinders are considered. An effective dynamic stiffness matrix method is then developed to evaluate the added mass and damping influence of the fluid on the natural frequencies and the dynamic response of the coupled riser system. A riser example is used to illustrate the fluid coupling impact on the system’s dynamic performance. The coupling through the fluid and centralizers can be optimally designed such that an inner pipe acts as a vibration absorber to the outer casing. SHEAR 7 JI...|$|E
40|$|The {{internal}} pressure strength of <b>tubing</b> <b>and</b> <b>casing</b> often cannot satisfy the design requirements in high pressure, high temperature and high H 2 S gas wells. Also, the practical safety coefficient of some wells {{is lower than}} the design standard according to the current API 5 C 3 standard, which brings some perplexity to the design. The ISO 10400 : 2007 provides the model which can calculate the burst strength of <b>tubing</b> <b>and</b> <b>casing</b> better than API 5 C 3 standard, but the calculation accuracy is not desirable because about 50 percent predictive values are remarkably higher than real burst values.

When the corrosion pits formed in the casing inner surface, localized stress concentration will occur and the casing strength will be degraded. Thus, it is essential to evaluate the degree of stress concentration factor accurately. This article performed a numerical simulation on double pits stress concentration factor in a curved inner surface using the finite element software ABAQUS. The results show that the stress concentration factor of double pits mainly depends on the ratio of two pits distance to the pit radius (L/R). It should not be only assessed by the absolute distance between the two pits. When the two pits are close and tangent, the maximum stress concentration factor will appear on the inner tangential edges. Stress concentration increased by double pits in a curved casing inner surface is more serious than that in a flat surface.

40|$|The oil {{industry}} uses gas separators in production wells as the free gas {{present in the}} suction of the pump reduces the pumping efficiency and pump lifetime. Therefore, free gas {{is one of the}} most important variables in the design of pumping systems. However, in the literature there is little information on these separators. It is the case of the inverted-shroud gravitational gas separator. It has an annular geometry due to the installation of a cylindrical container in between the well <b>casing</b> <b>and</b> pioduction pipe (<b>tubing).</b> The purpose of the present study is to understand the phenomenology and behavior of inverted-shroud separator. Experimental tests were performed in a 10. 5 -m-length inclinable glass tube with air and water as working fluids. The water flow rate was in the range of 8. 265 - 26. 117 l/min and the average inlet air mass flow rate was 1. 1041 kg/h, with inclination angles of 15 degrees, 30 degrees, 45 degrees, 60 degrees, 75 degrees, 80 degrees and 85 degrees. One of the findings is that the length between the inner annular level and production pipe inlet {{is one of the most}} important design parameters and based on that a new criterion for total gas separation is proposed. We also found that the phenomenology of the studied separator is not directly dependent on the gas flow rate, but on the average velocity of the free surface flow generated inside the separator. Maps of efficiency of gas separation were plotted and showed that liquid flow rate, inclination angle and pressure difference between <b>casing</b> <b>and</b> production pipe outlet are the main variables related to the gas separation phenomenon. The new data can be used for the development of design tools aiming to the optimized project of the pumping system for oil production in directional wells. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
