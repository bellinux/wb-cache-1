As {{part of an}} {{unconventional}} and criminal first contact, two Ferengi, Muk and Grish, board wearing breathing filters, and the crew {{appear to have been}} knocked unconscious. In Engineering, the two locate and deactivate a gas-machine that the Starfleet crew brought up from the surface of a nearby moon. Unknown to the intruders, Commander Tucker is still <b>conscious</b> <b>and</b> makes his way to Engineering and uses the ship's sensors to monitor the aliens as they plunder the ship.|$|E

The next morning his vital signs were good and doctors began to hope for recovery. A long vigil began, with Garfield's doctors issuing regular bulletins that the American public followed closely throughout the summer of 1881. His condition fluctuated. Fevers came and went. Garfield struggled to keep down solid food and spent most of the summer eating little, and that only liquids.|$|E

The way in which priming <b>and</b> <b>conscious</b> goals combine remains unresolved. We investigated the effect of goal-compatible or goal-incompatible priming on {{the pursuit of a}} conscious goal. Participants 1) were primed with accuracy-related words or inaccuracy-related words, 2) were given an instruction of accuracy (i. e. a <b>conscious</b> goal), <b>and</b> 3) performed an unskilled motor task. Results indicated that both nonconscious priming <b>and</b> <b>conscious</b> goal influence motor performance. Effects of priming <b>and</b> <b>conscious</b> goal pursuit are additive when contents are compatible and subtractive when they are incompatible...|$|R
40|$|Various {{researchers}} {{have tried to}} show that conscious thoughts (or more generally, <b>conscious</b> states <b>and</b> processes) have no causal influence on our behavior (“no-conscious-influence” thesis), threatening our conception of ourselves as free willed, morally responsible beings. In this paper I will argue such claims are unwarranted. I will claim that understanding the human mind in a purely mechanistic and reductionist manner is impossible — <b>conscious</b> introspection (<b>and</b> first person knowledge) are necessary to grasp fully the meaning of data gained solely by third-person methods. If understanding human mind is impossible without <b>conscious</b> introspection <b>and</b> first person knowledge and if this understanding has causal influence on behavior, we have found an indirect influence of <b>conscious</b> states <b>and</b> processes on our behavior, falsifying the “noconscious- influence” thesis...|$|R

5|$|Reports were sketchy {{initially}} – television pictures {{broadcast on}} ITV showed Stein, {{who appeared to}} be both <b>conscious</b> <b>and</b> alert, being carried down the tunnel by a number of police officers, with commentator Brian Moore speculating that he had been overcome with the emotion of the result. BBC Radio commentator Peter Jones (who had no access to the television pictures and was relying on information from other people in the press box) also speculated that the tension of the result and the night had led to Stein's collapse. Willie Miller, the Scottish captain on the night in the absence of Graeme Souness, was informed by Martin Tyler of ITV Sport during the post-match interview that Stein had collapsed, with Alex Ferguson entering the dressing room to tell them that Stein had suffered a heart attack.|$|E
5|$|Sam Black (Gabrielle Anwar) {{replaced}} Julie as {{the head}} of the graphics team in the second series. Sam is very fashion <b>conscious</b> <b>and</b> a flirt, and is surprised when an actor rejects her advances in favour of Sarah. Anwar had auditioned for the role of Lynda. (Many actors who unsuccessfully auditioned for main characters were invited back later for guest roles.) Moffat had expanded the role of Julie after the first series, but Lucy Benjamin was unavailable for series two. Sam, therefore, was basically the character of Julie under a different name, especially in her earlier episodes.|$|E
5|$|The Ecstatic was {{described}} by music journalists as a <b>conscious</b> <b>and</b> alternative hip hop record with an eccentric, internationalist quality. Mos Def's raps about global politics, love, spirituality, and social conditions were informed by the zeitgeist of the late 2000s, Black internalionalism, and Pan-Islamic ideas, as he incorporated a number of Islamic references throughout the album. Its loosely structured, lightly reverbed songs used unconventional time signatures and samples taken {{from a variety of}} international musical styles, including Afrobeat, soul, Eurodance, jazz, reggae, Latin, and Middle Eastern music. Mos Def titled The Ecstatic after one of his favorite novels—the 2002 Victor LaValle book of the same name—believing its titular phrase evoked his singular creative vision for the album.|$|E

40|$|Learning and {{teaching}} {{can be done}} by unconscious <b>and</b> <b>conscious</b> ways. Aims {{of this paper is to}} discuss how learning {{and teaching}} can take place through unconscious <b>and</b> <b>conscious</b> method. For this discussion, the paper is divided as two parts. The first part of the paper proposes to discuss what is meant by unconscious <b>and</b> <b>conscious</b> learning <b>and</b> teaching and how these things can take place. And the second part of the paper decides to suggest certain views how the students who can able to speak and write in English and do not know Tamil language can be taught Tamil language through the unconscious <b>and</b> <b>conscious</b> learning <b>and</b> teaching method. There are three ways of learning and teaching. They are 1. Unconscious learning and unconscious teaching 2. Learning unconsciously and teaching consciously 3. <b>Conscious</b> learning <b>and</b> <b>conscious</b> teaching. The method of unconscious learning and unconscious teaching is likely to happen in family profession. Here the learner may be an illiterate. Though the learning unconsciously and teaching consciously method could be seen in various fields, here we can give the example of house builders. In a family, the grand father and his son may work as house builders. And the grandson of this family may also go along with them as their assistance. In <b>conscious</b> learning <b>and</b> <b>conscious</b> teaching method teachers, doctors and most of the professional people come under this category, men and women join in some course. They studied the subjects and they do work consciously. The paper also pointed out how the teacher can make use of various methods-oral, writing, listening cum repetitive-in order to kindle the learner's interest in learning Tamil language consciously as well as unconsciously...|$|R

5|$|The {{controversy}} {{was triggered}} by allegations that, in February 1903, William Bayliss of the Department of Physiology at University College London performed an illegal vivisection, before an audience of 60 medical students, on a brown terrier dog—adequately anaesthetized, according to Bayliss and his team; <b>conscious</b> <b>and</b> struggling, according to the Swedish activists. The procedure was condemned as cruel and unlawful by the National Anti-Vivisection Society. Bayliss, whose research on dogs led {{to the discovery of}} hormones, was outraged by the assault on his reputation. He sued for libel and won.|$|E

In this episode, after being in a car accident, Reyes awakens in a surreal hospital. Doggett and a comatose Reyes struggle to prevent her organ donor card from being acted upon. The two, however, soon discover a unique woman, Audrey Pauley, who {{has the ability to}} communicate with both those <b>conscious</b> <b>and</b> unconscious.|$|E
5|$|With half {{a million}} burghers in the Commonwealth now {{substantially}} enfranchised, political power became more equally distributed, but little was done about the less politically <b>conscious</b> <b>and</b> active classes, such as the Jews and peasants. Although ArticleIV placed the Commonwealth's peasantry {{under the protection of}} the national lawa first step toward enfranchising the country's largest and most oppressed social classthe low status of the peasantry as compared to other classes was not eliminated, as the constitution did not abolish serfdom. Not until the Second Partition and Kościuszko's Proclamation of Połaniec in 1794 would the Polish government begin to abolish serfdom.|$|E

5|$|<b>Conscious</b> <b>and</b> planned {{colonization}} of the fertile, but underdeveloped region was pioneered in the 1580s and 1590s by the Ruthenian dukes of Volhynia. Of the Poles, only Jan Zamoyski, who penetrated the Bracław area, was economically active {{by the end}} of the 16th century. There and in the Kiev area Polish fortunes also began to develop, often through intermarriage with Ruthenian clans. In 1630, the great Ukrainian latifundia were dominated by Ruthenian families, such as the Ostrogski, Zbaraski and Zasławski. At the outset of the great civil war of 1648, the Polish settlers comprised barely 10% of the middle and petty nobility, for example in the well-researched Bracław Voivodeship and Kiev Voivodeship. The early Cossack rebellions were, therefore, instants of social uprising, rather than national anti-Polish movements. As class warfare they were ruthlessly stamped out by the state, which would sometimes take their leaders to Warsaw for execution.|$|E
5|$|Jeffrey {{insists on}} {{returning}} to Dorothy's apartment and tells Sandy to immediately send the police there, including her father. At Dorothy's apartment, Jeffrey finds Dorothy's husband, who is dead from a gunshot {{to the head}} and identifiable by his missing ear, {{as well as the}} Yellow Man, who bears a gruesome head wound, leaving him barely <b>conscious</b> <b>and</b> unresponsive but still standing. When Jeffrey tries to leave, he sees the Well-Dressed Man coming up the stairs and recognizes him as Frank in disguise. Jeffrey talks to Detective Williams over the Yellow Man's police radio, but lies about his location inside the apartment. Frank enters the apartment and brags about hearing Jeffrey's location over his own police radio. While Frank searches for him in the wrong room, Jeffrey retrieves the Yellow Man's gun and hides in the same closet in which he hid during his first visit to the apartment. Frank fires sporadically, knocking over the dead Yellow Man, who had still been standing up, and when he opens the closet door, Jeffrey fatally shoots him in the head. Detective Williams, gun drawn, enters with Sandy a moment later. Jeffrey and Sandy now go ahead with their relationship and note the unusual appearance of robins in their town. Dorothy and her son are reunited.|$|E
5|$|Regarding {{the primary}} {{function}} of conscious processing, a recurring idea in recent theories is that phenomenal states somehow integrate neural activities and information-processing {{that would otherwise}} be independent. This has been called the integration consensus. Another example has been proposed by Gerald Edelman called dynamic core hypothesis which puts emphasis on reentrant connections that reciprocally link areas of the brain in a massively parallel manner. Edelman also stresses the importance of the evolutionary emergence of higher-order consciousness in humans from the historically older trait of primary consciousness which humans share with non-human animals (see Neural correlates section above). These theories of integrative function present solutions to two classic problems associated with consciousness: differentiation and unity. They show how our conscious experience can discriminate between a virtually unlimited number of different possible scenes and details (differentiation) because it integrates those details from our sensory systems, while the integrative nature of consciousness in this view easily explains how our experience can seem unified as one whole despite all of these individual parts. However, it remains unspecified which kinds of information are integrated in a conscious manner and which kinds can be integrated without consciousness. Nor is it explained what specific causal role conscious integration plays, nor why the same functionality cannot be achieved without consciousness. Obviously not all kinds of information are capable of being disseminated consciously (e.g., neural activity related to vegetative functions, reflexes, unconscious motor programs, low-level perceptual analyses, etc.) and many kinds of information can be disseminated and combined with other kinds without consciousness, as in intersensory interactions such as the ventriloquism effect. Hence it remains unclear why any of it is conscious. For a review of the differences between <b>conscious</b> <b>and</b> unconscious integrations, see the article of E. Morsella.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Intuitively it {{has seemed}} to many that our {{concepts}} <b>conscious</b> state <b>and</b> <b>conscious</b> creature are sharp rather than vague, {{that they can have}} no borderline cases. On the other hand, many who take conscious states to be identical to, or realized by, complex physical states are committed to the vagueness of those concepts. In the paper I argue that <b>conscious</b> state <b>and</b> <b>conscious</b> creature are sharp by presenting four necessary conditions for conceiving borderline cases in general, and showing that some of those conditions cannot be met with conscious state. I conclude that conscious state is sharp, and the conclusion is then extended to conscious creature. The paper ends with a brief discussion of some implications. 1...|$|R
