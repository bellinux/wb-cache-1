5000|$|Carcharodon is a genus {{of sharks}} {{within the family}} Lamnidae. The only extant member of the genus is the great white shark (<b>Carcharodon</b> <b>carcharias).</b> Extinct members of the genus include Carcharodon caifassii and Carcharodon hubbelli. Carcharocles megalodon is still argued by some paleontologists (i. e. Michael D.

50|$|Regarded {{as one of}} {{the largest}} and most {{powerful}} predators in vertebrate history, C. megalodon probably had a profound impact on the structure of marine communities.

50|$|The largest living predatory fish, {{the great}} white shark (<b>Carcharodon</b> <b>carcharias),</b> reaches weights up to 2240 kg. Its extinct {{relative}} C. megalodon (the disputed genus being either Carcharodon or Carcharocles) was more than {{an order of magnitude}} larger, and is the largest predatory shark or fish of all time (and possibly the largest predator in vertebrate history); it preyed on whales and other marine mammals.|$|R
50|$|Like other known megatooth sharks, {{the fossils}} of C. angustidens {{indicate}} that it was considerably larger than the extant great white shark, <b>Carcharodon</b> <b>carcharias.</b> The well preserved specimen from New Zealand is estimated at 9.3 m in length.

5|$|The {{great white}} shark {{was one of the}} many {{amphibia}} originally described by Linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his Systema Naturae, its first scientific name, Squalus carcharias. Later, Sir Andrew Smith gave it Carcharodon as its generic name in 1833, and also in 1873. The generic name was identified with Linnaeus' specific name and the current scientific name, <b>Carcharodon</b> <b>carcharias,</b> was finalized. <b>Carcharodon</b> comes from the Ancient Greek words karcharos, which means sharp or jagged, and odous, which means tooth.|$|R
5|$|The sister species {{relationship}} between the longfin and shortfin makos has been confirmed by several phylogenetic studies based on mitochondrial DNA. In turn, the closest relative of the two mako sharks is the great white shark (<b>Carcharodon</b> <b>carcharias).</b> Fossil teeth belonging to the longfin mako have been recovered from the Muddy Creek marl of the Grange Burn formation, south of Hamilton, Australia, and from Mizumani Group in Gifu Prefecture, Japan. Both deposits date to the Middle Miocene epoch (15–11 million years ago (Mya).|$|R
25|$|Weaned pups, juveniles {{and even}} adults {{of up to}} adult male size may fall prey to orcas. Cases where weaned pups have been {{attacked}} and killed by leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx) and New Zealand sea lions (Phocarctos hookeri), exclusively small pups in the latter case, have been recorded. Great white sharks (<b>Carcharodon</b> <b>carcharias)</b> have hunted elephant seals near Campbell Island, while bite marks from a southern sleeper shark (Somniosus antarcticus) have been found on surviving elephant seals in the Macquarie Islands.|$|R

50|$|A {{commonly}} referred to transition is the evolution of Isurus hastalis, the Extinct Giant Mako, into the Great White shark, <b>Carcharodon</b> <b>carcharias.</b> There exist teeth that are believed to represent the transition between the two species. These teeth, from Carcharodon sp. are characterised by the wider, flatter crowns of the Extinct Giant Mako. However, they also exhibit partial, fading serrations, which are more pronounced near the root, and disappear towards {{the tip of the}} tooth - serrations being found in Great Whites but not Extinct Giant Makos.|$|R
500|$|Full-grown dusky sharks have no {{significant}} natural predators. Major predators of young sharks include the ragged tooth shark (Carcharias taurus), {{the great white}} shark (<b>Carcharodon</b> <b>carcharias),</b> the bull shark (C. leucas), and the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier). Off KwaZulu-Natal, the use of shark nets to protect beaches has reduced the populations of these large predators, leading to {{a dramatic increase in}} the number of juvenile dusky sharks (a phenomenon called [...] "predator release"). In turn, the juvenile sharks have decimated populations of small bony fishes, with negative consequences for the biodiversity of the local ecosystem.|$|R
40|$|Quantifying {{the energy}} {{requirements}} {{of animals in}} nature is critical for understanding physiological, behavioural, and ecosystem ecology; however, for difficult-to-study species such as large sharks, prey intake rates are largely unknown. Here, we use metabolic rates derived from swimming speed estimates to suggest that feeding requirements of the world's largest predatory fish, the white shark (<b>Carcharodon</b> <b>carcharias),</b> are several times higher than previously proposed. Further, our estimates of feeding frequency identify a clear benefit in seasonal selection of pinniped colonies - a white shark foraging strategy seen across much of their range...|$|R
40|$|Bacteria were cultured for {{the first}} time from the teeth of a great white shark (<b>Carcharodon</b> <b>carcharias).</b> Isolates {{included}} Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio fluvialis, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and other genera. All are common in the marine environment and some may be associated with wound infections in humans. Shark bite lacerations may serve as a source of these potentially infectious bacteria, particularly Vibrio spp., and should be treated immediately. Antibiotic susceptibility patterns are shown for representatives of Vibrio isolates and indicate that a variety of new agents may be appropriate chemotherapy for shark bite victims...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of {{ecological}} and life-history traits over ontogeny for long-lived migratory marine species {{is vital to}} creating effective conservation and management strategies, however these details are often difficult to obtain. Incrementally growing biomineralized structures, such as elasmobranch vertebrae, are metabolically stable and provide the potential to investigate changes in spatial and trophic ecology over ontogeny. In the present dissertation, chemical tracer analysis (δ 13 C, δ 15 N, and Δ 14 C) and opportunistic sightings data are used to address data deficiencies for a threatened marine predator (white shark, <b>Carcharodon</b> <b>carcharias)</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Similar, {{but less}} exaggerated, {{displays}} {{have been observed}} in 23 other shark species, among them the Galapagos shark (Carcharhinus galapagensis), the silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis), the blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus), the blacknose shark (Carcharhinus acronotus), the great white shark (<b>Carcharodon</b> <b>carcharias),</b> the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier), the bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas) and others. It is believed that the breaching and slapping of the tail {{on the surface of}} the water exhibited by great white sharks may be an agonistic display, but in this case based on competition for food rather than a perceived danger.|$|R
