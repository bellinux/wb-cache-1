5000|$|The first, {{mechanical}} trip computers, {{such as the}} Halda Speedpilot, {{produced by}} a Swedish taximeter manufacturer, {{were made in the}} 1950s as car accessories to enable the driver to maintain a given time schedule, particularly useful in rallying. One was installed as standard equipment in the 1958 Saab GT750. The 1952 Fiat 1900 came standard with a complex mechanical device, called mediometro in Italian, that showed the average speed. In 1978, the Cadillac division of General Motors introduced the [...] "Cadillac Trip Computer", available on the Cadillac Seville. Electronic trip computers were offered in General Motors vehicles, and are still usually reserved for fancier cars, although some cheaper models offered them as an option. They can range from basic to complex. The most basic trip computers incorporate average fuel mileage and perhaps an outside temperature display. Mid-range versions often include information on fuel, speed, distance, <b>cardinal</b> <b>heading</b> (compass), and elapsed time. The most advanced trip computers are reserved for high-end cars and often display average calculations for two drivers, a stop watch, tire-pressure information, over-speed warnings, and many other features.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{autonomous}} pedestrian navigation is often adopted for indoor pedestrian navigation. For outdoors, a Global Positioning System (GPS) {{is often used}} for navigation by utilizing GPS signals for position computation but indoors, its signals are often unavailable. Therefore, autonomous pedestrian navigation for indoors can be realized {{with the use of}} independent sensors, such as low-cost inertial sensors, and these sensors are often known as Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) where they do not rely on the reception of external information such as GPS signals. Using these sensors, a relative positioning concept from initialized position and attitude is used for navigation. The sensors sense the change in velocity and after integration, it is added to the previous position to obtain the current position. Such low-cost systems, however, are prone to errors that can result in a large position drift. This problem can be minimized by mounting the sensors on the pedestrian’s foot. During walking, the foot is briefly stationary while it is on the ground, sometimes called the zero-velocity period. If a non-zero velocity is then measured by the inertial sensors during this period, it is considered as an error and thus can be corrected. These repeated corrections to the inertial sensor’s velocity measurements can, therefore, be used to control the error growth and minimize the position drift. Nonetheless, it is still inadequate, mainly due to the remaining errors on the inertial sensor’s heading when the velocity corrections are used alone. Apart from the initialization issue, therefore, the heading drift problem still remains in such low-cost systems. In this research, two novel methods are developed and investigated to mitigate the heading drift problem when used with the velocity updates. The first method is termed <b>Cardinal</b> <b>Heading</b> Aided Inertial Navigation (CHAIN), where an algorithm is developed to use building ‘heading ’ to aid the heading measurement in the i...|$|E
