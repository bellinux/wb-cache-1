25|$|The Quaid Post {{was located}} at an {{altitude}} of 22,153 feet. It was extremely difficult to attack, as it was surrounded by 457 m high ice walls. It had an inclination of 80° to 85° on three sides, and a little less on the fourth side. It was very difficult for the attackers to climb up the peak without getting noticed by the Pakistani soldiers stationed at the top. The scarcity of oxygen made walking long distances difficult, as the troops had to halt every few meters to regain their breath. There were also frequent blizzards, and taking advantage of poor visibility at night was difficult due to the wind <b>chill</b> <b>factor.</b> The minimum temperatures in the area were as low as -50°C at that time.|$|E

50|$|Uranium City {{is part of}} the Taiga Shield Ecozone and {{experiences}} a subarctic climate (Köppen Dfc) with long, cold, snowy winters, brief transitional periods, and short, cool, and humid summers. The temperature range is typically large due to frigidly cold winter temperatures that often plunge below -30 C. The highest temperature ever recorded in the settlement was 34.7 C on 27 July 1984. Wind <b>chill</b> <b>factors</b> are prominent as well in the winter months, making the cold temperatures seem to be much colder than they actually are.

25|$|One must {{be careful}} when {{measuring}} temperature {{to ensure that the}} measuring instrument (thermometer, thermocouple, etc.) is really the same temperature as the material that is being measured. Under some conditions heat from the measuring instrument can cause a temperature gradient, so the measured temperature is different from the actual temperature of the system. In such a case the measured temperature will vary not only with the temperature of the system, but also with the heat transfer properties of the system. An extreme case of this effect gives rise to the wind <b>chill</b> <b>factor,</b> where the weather feels colder under windy conditions than calm conditions even though the temperature is the same. What is happening is that the wind increases the rate of heat transfer from the body, resulting in a larger reduction in body temperature for the same ambient temperature.|$|E

50|$|The Grandfather trail {{traverses}} the 2.4 {{miles of}} ridgeline between Calloway Peak and the Swinging Bridge (Linville Peak), attaining Attic Window and MacRae Peaks along the way. This trail {{is among the}} most difficult and technical in the region. In addition to significant steep elevation gain and loss, trail conditions include frequent exposure to very high winds, contiguity to several large cliffs, crossings of cracked boulders, and multiple traverses aided by fixed ladders and cables. This 2.4 miles is normally covered at below half of normal hiking pace. In favorable weather conditions this trail is considered advanced. In poor weather, (throughout the winter and much of spring), this trail should only be attempted by experienced, expert hikers, due to significant formation of ice sheets, accumulation of snow, frequent low visibility, and commonly sub-zero wind <b>chill</b> <b>factors.</b> Significantly, in the early months of 2011, the state park service closed trail access to MacRae peak, something very seldom if ever done under private ownership.

50|$|The Rangipo Desert {{receives}} 1500 - 2500 mm {{of rainfall}} per year, but resembles a desert {{because of a}} poor soil quality and drying winds, and also due to the mass sterilization of seeds during a series of violent eruptions, particularly ignimbrite flows about 20,000 years ago. The vegetation is low and sparse, consisting of mainly tussock and snow grasses. The headwaters of many small streams, which later turn into large rivers, gouge deep serrated valleys through the unconsolidated ash and pumice-rich earth. The climate here is harsh and alpine, with close to 270 ground frosts per year in comparison with less than 30 in the coastal regions of Hawke's Bay, 80 km to the east. Heavy snowfalls - rarely seen {{in the rest of}} the island - are also a common occurrence in winter.

40|$|Demographic {{parameters}} of the European hare (Lepus europaeus) in southern Australia were investigated by dissecting hares shot by hunters during each month of the year. Gender, body weight, age, sucking, lactation, weight of the abdominal alimentary canal, weight of the left peri-renal fat body, pregnancy status, presence and counts of placental scars, litter size, and stage of gestation were recorded. From those data, growth rates, age at weaning, age and weight at puberty, date of conception, projected birth date, recruitment, survivorship, and the relationships between lactation and fat stores and alimentary capacity were determined. Fecundity of the southern Australian hares followed the seasonal pattern reported for northern hemisphere populations. However, output was lower per female and particularly per older female. Females began breeding {{at an earlier age}} such that recruitment into the southern Australian population was more dependent on females in their first year of life than on older females. Growth rates were comparable with European rates. Although high <b>chill</b> <b>factors</b> were apparently associated with higher leveret mortality, there was paradoxically higher overall mortality during the spring-early summer period of higher plant growth than in the late summer–winter period of lower plant growth and more extreme weather conditions. Fat was accumulated during pregnancy and would act as a buffer against the possibility of inadequate food availability during lactation, but hares increased the capacity of the alimentary canal during lactation and presumably with it their ability to assimilate energy {{to meet the demands of}} lactation.

50|$|Ashe County, North Carolina has a {{considerably}} different climate {{than most of}} the Southeastern United States. Summers typically average around 80 F. Temperatures rarely exceed 90 F, but on rare occasions can reach the mid-90s as they did in 2012 - the most recent that 90+ was observed. 100 F+ has never been observed. Summer nights are cool, and temperatures often dip to near 60 F even in July. In winter there is snow, averaging about 30 in for the towns of Jefferson and West Jefferson during the past thirty years. There has been only about 66 percent of normal snowfall observed over the past four winter seasons (2013-2017). Considerably more snow falls on the peaks and the western slopes of the Appalachian Mountains. During the 2009-2010 snow season Jefferson received some 60 in of snow. Snow has been observed as early as around October 1 and as late as around May 1. Ashe County is also a very windy location especially in winter when several times per year the Jefferson Airport sees the wind gusting 60 to 85 mph. In addition it does get very cold in Ashe County. In 2015 the temperature dipped below 0 F on four occasions, the coldest being &minus;8 F. Single digit temperatures, often just above zero Fahrenheit, are observed most winter seasons on occasion.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} meteorological factors on the esophagogastric variceal bleeding. The rhythmicity and variation mechanism of the onset of esophagogastric variceal bleeding were determined by large sample study. Methods: 572 patients with esophagogastric variceal bleeding confirmed by endoscopy {{were enrolled in the}} study, and the gender, age, onset date and Child-Pugh grading of liver function were recorded, the meteorological data were provided by the Shiyan Meteorological Bureau, which included temperature, air pressure, air speed, precipitation, sunshine duration and so on. Results: The onset numbers in the four seasons were 130, 122, 144 and 176, respectively, and differences of the onset number in different seasons were significant (X 2 = 11. 888, p = 0. 008), and the onset number in winter reached to maximum, while it decreased to minimum in summer. The results of Child-Pugh grading were as follows: Grade A 113 (19. 8 %), Grade B 234 (40. 9 %), and Grade C 225 (39. 3 %). There was no significance among the different grades by crosstabs analysis (X 2 = 4. 463, p = 0. 107). The Spearman correlation analysis concluded the result of (r > 0 and p ?C accumulated temperature. The p value was more than 0. 01 inthe other factors. Conclusion: The onset of esophagogastric variceal bleeding was rhythmical, which rose to the maximum in winter and decreased to minimum in summer. The onset of the disease correlated positively with daily air pressure (mean, maximal, minimal), daily mean temperature, ten days’ air pressure (mean, daily difference, maximal, minimal and range) and ten days’ temperature range, and correlated negatively with daily maximal temperature, daily minimal temperature, ten days’ temperature (mean, maximal and minimal) and ten days’ ≥ 0 °C accumulated temperature, and had no relationship with other factors. The mechanism of the onset may associate with the increase of portal venous flow through vasoconstriction induced by <b>chill</b> <b>factors.</b> It also may be the variation of air pressure which influenced the intraesophageal pressure and led to intraesophageal hemangiectasia that may increase the risk of bleeding. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the climate of a large area with few reporting stations requires a special approach. Northern Saskatchewan, examined in this study, {{is an example of}} such an area. The objectives of this study, therefore, are to determine how to evaluate the climatic environment of a large area with few reporting stations and to apply the methods to an analysis of the climate of northern Saskatchewan. A completeness index, developed by the author, was used to measure how satisfactory the climatological records were in terms of length and number of gaps. A correlation analysis, the point distribution coefficient and the spatial pattern of the completeness index were employed for the {{evaluation of}} the network of observing stations. Methods for temporal and spatial estimation were applied and the results were tested. It was found that monthly data and normals could be estimated satisfactorily but that daily data could not be as adequately estimated. The results of the spatial estimation were found to be acceptable, although estimated precipitation values were usually less acceptable than estimated temperature values. The improved data base was then used to evaluate the temperature and precipitation climate of northern Saskatchewan. Several intriguing features were disclosed. For example, it was found that stations in the central portion of the study area have January extreme minima that are as much as 6 Â° C. higher than those of the stations of the southern margin of the study area. The frequency of occurrence of mean monthly temperatures proved useful in both temporal and spatial analyses. Cold and warm spells, that is, periods of consecutive days with temperatures below or above certain levels, respectively, were also examined. A noticeable pattern in the distribution of cold spells was found. The distribution shows an abrupt increase in the average number of cold spells per winter north of about 57 Â° North. Other aspects of the climate of northern Saskatchewan such as the frost-free season, growing degree-days, heating degree-days, wind chill and humidex were evaluated, where possible. It was found that wind <b>chill</b> <b>factors</b> at locations in the study area are less than those at Regina, the comparison station in southern Saskatchewan. The length of the frost-free season was found to be just as long in parts of the northern margin as in the southern margin of the study area.
