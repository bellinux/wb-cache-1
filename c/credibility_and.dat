40|$|This study {{examines}} {{a key component}} of environmental risk communication; trust <b>and</b> <b>credibility.</b> The study was conducted in two parts. In the first part, six hypotheses regarding the perceptions and determinants of trust <b>and</b> <b>credibility</b> were tested against survey data. The hypotheses were supported by the data. The most important hypothesis was that perceptions of trust <b>and</b> <b>credibility</b> are dependent on three factors: perceptions of knowledge and expertise; perceptions of openness and honesty; and perceptions of concern and care. In the second part, models were constructed with perceptions of trust <b>and</b> <b>credibility</b> as the dependent variable. The goal was to examine the data for findings with direct policy implications. One such finding was that defying a negative stereotype is key to improving perceptions of trust <b>and</b> <b>credibility.</b> KEY WORDS: h s k communication; risk perception; trust <b>and</b> <b>credibility</b> determinants. 1...|$|R

5|$|These speculations {{cannot be}} proven without doubt {{but as a}} governor, Odaenathus {{would have been the}} highest {{authority}} in the province and above any legionary commander and provincial officials; this would make him the commander of the Roman forces in the province. Whatever the case may be, starting from 258, Odaenathus strengthened his position and extended his political influence in the region.

5|$|Combs' uninspiring {{speeches and}} candidness {{about the need}} for more state revenue cost him the primary election. Chandler, who went on to reclaim the governorship, had promised that he would not need to raise taxes to meet the state's {{financial}} obligations, but ultimately he did so. This damaged Chandler's <b>credibility</b> <b>and</b> left Combs looking courageous and honest {{in the eyes of the}} electorate. Consequently, in 1959 Combs was elected governor, defeating Lieutenant Governor Harry Lee Waterfield, Chandler's choice to succeed him in office, in the primary. Early in his term, Combs secured passage of a three-percent sales tax to pay a bonus to the state's military veterans. Knowing a tax of one percent would have been sufficient, he used the excess revenue to enact a system of reforms, including expansion of the state's highway and state park systems. He also devoted much of the surplus to education.|$|E
5|$|Feijó's {{administration}} {{was unable to}} suppress the uprisings in both the north and south. By 1837, his government's <b>credibility</b> <b>and</b> support had vanished. Feijó resigned in August 1837 and Pedro de Araújo Lima (later the Marquis of Olinda), a Reactionary from Pernambuco Province, became interim regent and {{was elected to the}} office the next year. He appointed his colleagues to ministry portfolios. Honório Hermeto, who had been reelected to another term as general deputy until 1841, remained in the Chamber as the party's leader to bolster the new Reactionary cabinet. The ever-weak Moderate Party collapsed, and Feijo's Moderates allied with other groups with which they shared no common principles or ideology. During the late 1830s and early 1840s, this alliance evolved into the second Liberal Party.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 19July 1941, Stojanović and Bašić arrived at the camp of the communists and their sympathisers who escaped from Prijedor, {{situated}} at Rajlića Kosa above the village of Malo Palančište. The news of Stojanović's escape soon spread throughout the Prijedor district. The group, mostly in the early twenties, enjoyed an increase in their <b>credibility</b> <b>and</b> esteem since a well-known and respected doctor had joined their camp. People from surrounding Serb villages brought food and other supplies to Stojanović and his young comrades. Stojanović gave speeches to the villagers, telling them {{to be prepared for}} an impending uprising and urging them to bring him rifles they were hiding in their homes. The camp at Rajlića Kosa was the first Partisan camp in the Kozara area.|$|E
5|$|Then-leader of the opposition, Nawaz Sharif (who {{would later}} become Pakistan's prime minister), lodged a {{petition}} with the Supreme Court of Pakistan to investigate the origins, <b>credibility</b> <b>and</b> purpose of the memorandum. His and other petitions lodged with the Supreme Court alleged that the memorandum had been drafted by Haqqani {{at the behest of}} Pakistan's then-president, Asif Ali Zardari, and delivered without knowledge of the country's powerful armed forces and intelligence services. On December 30, 2011, after reviewing Sharif's petition, the Supreme Court constituted a Judicial Commission to conduct a broad inquiry. Ijaz was among the , as were Pakistan's intelligence chief, Ahmad Shuja Pasha and Haqqani. Pakistan's army chief Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani submitted written testimony to the Supreme Court, as did then-Prime Minister Yousef Raza Gilani on behalf of the Zardari government.|$|E
5|$|Two {{weeks before}} the primary, Combs was {{endorsed}} by former Vice-President and native Kentuckian Alben W. Barkley, but Combs felt the endorsement came too late to be much help. Chandler defeated Combs in the primary {{by a vote of}} 259,875 to 241,754 and went on to win his second term as governor. Combs returned to Prestonsburg, set up a savings and loan company, and re-established his law practice. During the four years of Chandler's term, Combs accepted a number of speaking engagements, but otherwise remained out of the public eye. Meanwhile, the state's need for funds compelled Chandler to raise the state sales tax and other taxes, despite his campaign promises not to do so. Consequently, Chandler lost <b>credibility</b> <b>and</b> Combs gained a reputation as a courageous, forthright, and honest politician for having acknowledged the state's financial need during the campaign.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, Public Enemy {{released}} {{their second}} album It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back to critical and commercial success. Their music's dense textures, {{provided by the}} group's production team The Bomb Squad, exemplified a new production aesthetic in hip hop at the time. The controversial, politically charged lyrics by the group's lead rapper Chuck D, whose braggadocio raps contained references to political figures such as Assata Shakur and Nelson Mandela, as well as endorsements of Nation of Islam-leader Louis Farrakhan, intensified the group's affiliation with black nationalism and Farrakhan. It Takes a Nations success helped raise hip hop's profile as both art and sociopolitical statement, amid media criticism of the genre. It helped give hip hop a critical <b>credibility</b> <b>and</b> standing in the popular music community after it had been largely dismissed as a fad since its introduction {{at the turn of}} the 1980s. In promoting the record, Public Enemy expanded their live shows and performing dynamic. With the album's content and the group's rage-filled showmanship in concert, they became the vanguard of a movement in hip hop that reflected a new black consciousness and socio-political dynamic that were taking shape in America at the time.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the late Republic, {{formerly}} authoritative institutions lost their <b>credibility</b> <b>and</b> authority. For example, the Sullan reforms to the Senate strongly split the aristocratic class between those who stayed in the city and those who rose to high office abroad, further increasing class divides between Romans, even at the highest levels. Furthermore, the dominance of the military in the late Republic, along with stronger ties between a general and his troops, caused by their longer terms of service together and the troops' reliance on that general to provide for their retirements, along with an obstructionist central government, meant a huge number of malcontent soldiers willing to take up arms against the state. Adding in the institutionalisation of violence as a means to obstruct or force political change (e.g. the deaths of the Gracchi and Sulla's dictatorship, respectively), the Republic was caught in an ever more violent and anarchic struggle between the Senate, assemblies at Rome, and the promagistrates. It would only be resolved by civil war, a war which the promagistrate governors and their troops would win, and in doing so, collapse the Republic.|$|E
