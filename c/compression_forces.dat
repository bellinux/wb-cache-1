5|$|Other {{studies suggest}} that rivaling Carnotaurus did not deliver rapid head blows, but pushed slowly against each other with the upper sides of their skulls. Thus, the horns {{may have been a}} device for the {{distribution}} of <b>compression</b> <b>forces</b> without damage to the brain. This is supported by the flattened upper sides of the horns, the strongly fused bones of the top of the skull, and the inability of the skull to survive rapid head blows.|$|E

At the apical vertebra, average bone density for the concave cortical bone is higher than for the convex cortical bone, and cancellous bone density is higher for the concave side than for the convex side. The concave side of a vertebra is less porous and has a thicker cortical bone than the convex side, {{which is consistent with}} Wolff’s law about bone remodeling.|$|E
40|$|Rationale: Mammography {{practitioners}} {{control the}} amount of <b>compression</b> <b>force</b> applied to the breast. There are no quantifiable recommendations for optimal <b>compression</b> <b>force</b> levels for practitioners to follow. Clients report variations in pain and discomfort when <b>compression</b> <b>force</b> is applied. Until now practitioner <b>compression</b> <b>force</b> variability has not been investigated; even though this might lead to variations in client pain and discomfort. The primary purpose of this thesis was to investigate whether practitioner <b>compression</b> <b>force</b> variability exists. Method: Three research papers investigated practitioner <b>compression</b> <b>force</b> variability: one used a cross sectional design; two used longitudinal designs, one was single centre {{and the other was}} multicentre. Three further research papers investigated important issues which might confound practitioner variability results: the first investigated compression paddle bend and distortion; the second investigated how breast thickness and <b>compression</b> <b>force</b> vary; the third evaluated practitioner ability to grade breast density, visually. The final research paper was a ‘within client’ investigation to determine how image quality varied with breast thickness and <b>compression</b> <b>force.</b> Key findings: The research firmly demonstrates that practitioner <b>compression</b> <b>force</b> variability exists. Multicentre analysis (4500 client visits) confirmed two out of three screening sites with significant practitioner variability, with the third screening site having a minimum dictate of <b>compression</b> <b>force</b> at 100 N.

40|$|The {{application}} of breast compression in mammography {{may be more}} heavily influenced by the practitioner rather than the client. This could affect image quality and will affect client experience. This study builds on previous research to establish if mammography practitioners vary in the <b>compression</b> <b>force</b> they apply over a six year period. This longitudinal study assessed 3 consecutive analogue screens of 500 clients within one screening centre in the UK. Recorded data included: practitioner code, applied pressure (daN), breast thickness (mm), BI-RADS® density category and breast dose. Exclusion criteria included: previous breast surgery, previous/ongoing assessment, breast implants. 344 met inclusion criteria. Data analysis: assessed variation of <b>compression</b> <b>force</b> (daN) and breast thickness (mm) over 3 sequential screens to determine whether <b>compression</b> <b>force</b> and breast thickness were affected by practitioner variations. <b>Compression</b> <b>force</b> over the 3 screens varied significantly; variation was highly dependent upon the practitioner who performed the mammogram. Significant thickness and <b>compression</b> <b>force</b> differences over the 3 screens were noted for the same client ( 0. 31). When practitioners from different <b>compression</b> <b>force</b> groups performed 3 screens, maximum <b>compression</b> <b>force</b> variations were higher and significantly different (p< 0. 0001). The amount of <b>compression</b> <b>force</b> used is highly dependent upon practitioner rather than client. This has implications for radiation dose, patient experience and image quality consistency...|$|R

The body posture of the woman exerts physical stresses upon the pectoralis major muscles and the pectoralis minor muscles, which cause the weight of the breasts to induce static and dynamic shear forces (when standing and when walking), <b>compression</b> <b>forces</b> (when lying supine), and tension forces (when kneeling on four limbs).|$|E
2500|$|Macropsia may be {{a result}} of optical {{magnification}} differences between the eyes, retinal receptor distribution, or the cortical processing of the sampled image. The current hypothesis for the occurrence of dysmetropsia is due to the stretching or compression of the retina leading to the displacement of receptors. [...] Macropsia arises from a compressed receptor distribution leading to a larger perceived image size and conversely, micropsiaresults from stretching of the retina leading to a more sparse receptor distribution that gives a smaller perceived image size. [...] In the case of macropsia, the greater density of photoreceptor cells leads to greater stimulation making the object seem larger. [...] In some cases, the effects of macropsia {{have been shown to be}} field dependent, in that the degree of visual distortion is related to the visual field angle. [...] Non-uniform stretching or compression of the receptor distribution could explain the field dependency of the macrospia. [...] If the <b>compression</b> <b>forces</b> were closer to the fovea the resulting compression would cause a greater amount of macropsia at lower field angles with little effect at higher field angles where the receptor distribution is not as compressed. [...] Alterations in receptor distribution can be the result of epiretinal membrane, neuroretina detachment and/or re-attachment, or retinoschisis. [...] Macropsia caused by surgical re-attachment of macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is not symmetrical around the fovea, resulting in differences size changes in the horizontal and vertical meridians. [...] Asymmetry has also been observed with retinoschisis, in which macropsia generally results in the vertical direction while micropsia presents in the horizontal direction.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Compression {{is used in}} {{mammography}} {{to reduce}} breast thickness, which is claimed to improve image quality and reduce radiation dose. In the Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP), the recommended range of <b>compression</b> <b>force</b> for full field digital mammography is 11 - 18 kg (108 - 177 Newton [N]). This is the first study to investigate the <b>compression</b> <b>force</b> used in the program.

40|$|Objective: Literature {{speculates that}} visual image quality (IQ) and <b>compression</b> <b>force</b> levels may be {{directly}} related. This small study investigates whether a relationship exists between <b>compression</b> <b>force</b> levels and visual IQ. Method: To investigate how visual IQ varies with {{different levels of}} <b>compression</b> <b>force,</b> 39 clients were selected over a 6 year screening period that had received markedly different amounts of <b>compression</b> <b>force</b> on each of their three sequential screens. Images for the 3 screening episodes for all women were scored visually using 3 different IQ scales. Results: Correlation coefficients between the 3 IQ scales were positive and high (0. 82, 0. 9 and 0. 85). For the scales, the IQ scores their correlation does not vary significantly, even though different compression levels had been applied. Kappa IQ scale 1 : 0. 92, 0. 89, 0. 89. ANOVA IQ scale 2 : p = 0. 98, p = 0. 55, p = 0. 56. ICC IQ scale 3 : 0. 97, 0. 93, 0. 91. Conclusion: For the 39 clients {{there is no difference}} in visual IQ when different amounts of compression are applied. We believe that further work should be conducted into <b>compression</b> <b>force</b> and image quality as ‘higher levels’ of <b>compression</b> <b>force</b> may not be justified in the attainment of suitable visual image quality...|$|R
30|$|According to Whelehan et al. [44], clients avoid re-attending for {{screening}} mammography due to breast pain {{experienced in the}} previous exams. During a mammography exam, pain can arise from the application of <b>compression</b> <b>force,</b> being also a challenge in the radiographer practice, as the radiographer rather than the client influences the application of <b>compression</b> <b>force</b> in mammography. The application of <b>compression</b> <b>force</b> and the resultant pain can affect client experience, radiation dose and image quality (noise, sharpness, movement artefacts), {{and needs to be}} addressed in radiographer education and training. Mercer et al. [28] also highlighted in their study the considerable variability in breast <b>compression</b> <b>force</b> applied during mammography examination, showing room for improvements in practice and consequently in radiographers’ education. It is crucial to identify strategies allowing the optimisation of breast compression, resulting in pain reduction and improving the image quality.|$|R

We retrospectively collected 15818 raw digital mammograms from 3772 Asian women aged 35 - 80 years who underwent screening or diagnostic mammography between Jan 2012 and Dec 2014 at our center.
