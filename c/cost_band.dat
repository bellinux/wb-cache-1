40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the dynamics of}} deviations from covered interest parity using daily data on the UK/US spot, forward exchange rates and interest rates over the period January 1974 to September 1993. Like other studies we find {{a substantial number of}} instances during the sample in which the covered interest parity condition exceeds the transaction <b>costs</b> <b>band,</b> implying arbitrage profit opportunities. While most of these implied profit opportunities are relatively small, there is also evidence of some very large deviations from covered interest parity in the sample. In order to examine the persistence of these deviations, we estimated a threshold autoregression in which the dynamics behavior of deviations from covered interest parity is different outside the transaction <b>costs</b> <b>band</b> than inside them. We find that while the impulse response functions when inside the transaction <b>costs</b> <b>band</b> are nearly symmetric, those for the outside the bands are asymmetric-suggesting less persistence outside of the transaction <b>costs</b> <b>band</b> than inside the band.

This paper presents {{a new class of}} folded hairpin line microstrip resonator filters with 40 - 50 % reduction in size compared to the conventional hairpin line resonators. The proposed double-fold hairpin line microstrip filters are slow wave open loop type narrow band, high selectivity, small sized and low <b>cost</b> <b>band</b> pass filters for wireless/RF trans/receive communication systems for ground and space applications in S-band. In the proposed filter the cross couplings have been realized between adjacent and non-adjacent resonators.

The measured results are close to the simulated results, with great reduction in size compared to the conventional planar hairpin line structure.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) Yen interventions {{for the period}} 13 May 1991 to 16 March 2004. The previous literature has been hampered by the coarse daily data and {{has been unable to}} identify intervention determinants beyond some embodiment of the first moment of Yen returns. We consider both lagged overnight off-shore (London and New York) and intradaily on-shore (Tokyo) market developments for their heterogeneous influences on the BOJ's intervention decisions. Using a friction model to estimate the reaction function, we find that the interventions were leaning against the wind during the Tokyo hours, in general. Prior to June 1995, there were significant responses to previous day's intradaily Yen returns and volatility. Post- 1995, we report a broadening in the BOJ's monitoring to include overnight off-shore Yen returns until Dec 2002 and a broader measure of market disorderliness measured as a transactions <b>cost</b> <b>band</b> in one-month covered interest rate parity condition since Jan 2003. Moreover, {{there is some evidence that}} the BOJ secretly leaned into the wind in response to Yen depreciations during the recent period of 2003 - 2004.

The imperical equations and relevant graphs have been used to realize adjacent and cross couplings between the four multi-folded resonators. A conventional hairpin-line resonator size is normally very large. The folded hairpin line resonator filters are compact, small sized and simple to design and fabricate.

40|$|In recent years, {{natural gas}} prices in the U. S. have reached {{historic}} lows and utilities have been rapidly replacing coal with gas-fired generation. Natural gas prices are historically volatile, and overreliance on natural gas can lead to high electricity prices {{in the event of}} rising fuel costs or price spikes. We examine how utilities can use wind energy from long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) as a tool to hedge against natural gas price volatility and future environmental regulations. We assess how federal and state policies affect wind’s hedging value, and provide a case study on how utilities in the Southeast are increasingly importing wind from high capacity regions. We quantify wind’s hedging value by comparing the net present value (NPV) of investment costs for a natural gas combined cycle plant with and without wind generation to meet future demand under uncertainty. We use wind prices from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory national wind PPA sample, and analyze six investment options over a 30 -year period using the U. S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) AEO 2013 natural gas price scenarios with and without carbon tax, and our own scenarios created using Monte Carlo simulation and Random Walk. Assuming a least-cost framework, we find that the utility would only invest in gas generation under the EIA reference scenario. In our model, the utility will have an NPV <b>cost</b> <b>band</b> from $ 4. 7 to $ 10. 1 billion if they do not hedge with wind, whereas if they add 20 % wind to their portfolio, the maximum cost will decrease by $ 774 million if the worst-case gas price scenario were to occur. By procuring wind energy at fixed prices through long-term PPAs, utilities can reduce their exposure to unfavorable cost outcomes, particularly if a carbon tax of $ 10 per ton or more is enacted...|$|E

40|$|Background Early in {{a season}} the crop covers only part of total field area. Treating that area uniformly can {{therefore}} be wasteful. An ability to differentiate between crop rows and inter-row spaces would provide opportunities for increased treatment efficacy, reduced environmental impact and reduced input <b>costs.</b> <b>Banded</b> treatments on, or between crop rows, requires a level of precision {{that is difficult to}} achieve in practice. So, despite the potential advantages inter-row cultivation and band spraying are limited to use in high value crops. Recent advances pioneered by some of the consortium partners now offer automatic guidance systems for inter-row cultivation. These are currently used in intensive vegetable production and by those growing cereals organically. They offer enhanced accuracy, higher forward speeds and reduced driver fatigue compared to manual systems. Whilst helpful, the science behind these developments has limitations with respect to work rate. In particular the need for inter-row hoes to match drill bout width makes such systems uneconomic for conventional cereal producers.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{empirical evidence}} on the linkage between foreign exchange market volatility and daily 90 -day covered interest rate parity (CIP) conditions {{of the three major}} exchange rates against the US dollar (US$). Markov regime shifting models were utilized to generate time series of volatility regime probabilities and these were used to explain the first and second moments of the daily deviations from and the transaction <b>cost</b> <b>bands</b> around the covered parity conditions. We find a significant positive relationship between the deviations and the regime probabilities, indicating an increasing probability of higher volatility state being associated with rising deviations (both first and second moments) from the parity condition. Similar positive relationship is found for the transaction bands. Rising (falling) probabilities of high (low) volatility regimes increased the first and second moments of the bands. Furthermore, we find a higher volatility state combined with a US$ depreciation is associated with significantly higher volatility in the daily deviations than an appreciation. Also, US$ depreciation is associated with widening transaction bands. This suggests that the level of market uncertainty was higher when the US$ was depreciating...|$|R
