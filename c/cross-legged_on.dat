5|$|Seneb is {{depicted}} {{with his wife}} and children in a painted sculpture from his tomb, rediscovered in 1926, that is a famous example of Old Kingdom art. It shows him sitting <b>cross-legged</b> <b>on</b> a block of stone with his wife embracing him and his children standing below him where the legs of a full-size person would ordinarily have been. The composition of the scene thus achieves a harmonious symmetry. It depicts Seneb realistically with the facial features and shortened limbs of an individual with achondroplasia, a common form of dwarfism. Paintings and carvings in the tomb give his titles and depict various scenes from his life, such as carrying out inspections of his estate and holding symbols of his office.|$|E
5|$|The {{limestone}} {{sculpture of}} Seneb {{and his family}} {{is part of the}} collection of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. It depicts Seneb and his wife sitting next to each other with their children in the lower register. Seneb is depicted sitting <b>cross-legged</b> <b>on</b> a block of stone with his arms folded in a position characteristic of a scribe. His wife Senet sits alongside him, wearing a long robe with long sleeves and a wig covering her natural hair, which can be glimpsed on her forehead. She encircles him with her arms in a gesture of affection and support. She is shown with a slight smile on her face to signify her contentment and happiness.|$|E
5|$|The {{worship of}} Shiva became popular in Central Asia through the Hephthalite Empire, and Kushan Empire. Shaivism was also popular in Sogdia and the Kingdom of Yutian as found {{from the wall}} {{painting}} from Penjikent on the river Zervashan. In this depiction, Shiva is portrayed with a sacred halo and a sacred thread ("Yajnopavita"). He is clad in tiger skin while his attendants are wearing Sogdian dress. A panel from Dandan Oilik shows Shiva in His Trimurti form with Shakti kneeling on her right thigh. Another site in the Taklamakan Desert depicts him with four legs, seated <b>cross-legged</b> <b>on</b> a cushioned seat supported by two bulls. It is also noted that Zoroastrian wind god Vayu-Vata took on the iconographic appearance of Shiva.|$|E

25|$|Dikir barat is {{typically}} performed by groups of {{ten to fifteen}} members, {{though there is no}} actual set size, even in competitive environments. A group usually sits <b>cross-legged</b> <b>on</b> a platform, sometimes surrounded by the audience. Where the dikir barat is performed competitively, the two competing groups will both be on the stage at the same time.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{they sat}} down, <b>cross-legged,</b> one <b>on</b> {{each side of}} the tarpaulin, and began the meal. That was the strangest supper Joan ever sat down to; it was like a dream where there was danger that {{tortured}} her; but she knew she was dreaming and would soon wake up. Kells was almost imperceptibly changing. The amiability of his face seemed to have stiffened. The only time he addressed her was when he offered to help her to more meat or bread or coffee. After the meal was finished he would not let her wash the pans and pots, and attended to that himself.|$|R

5000|$|Rhys Ifans and Howard Marks {{appeared}} on The Late Late Show on 1 October 2010 to discuss Mr. Nice, the British independent film in which Ifans portrayed Marks. During the interview Ifans was playful with host Ryan Tubridy, {{at one point}} referring {{to him as a}} [...] "dainty little bugger" [...] in reference to his <b>cross-legged</b> manner. Netizens <b>on</b> boards.ie to this day refer to Tubridy as [...] "DLB" [...] in tribute to this incident.|$|R
25|$|Indo-Scythian coins {{essentially}} {{continue the}} Indo-Greek tradition, {{by using the}} Greek language on the obverse and the Kharoshthi language on the reverse. The portrait of the king is never shown however, and is replaced by depictions of the king on horse (and sometimes on camel), or sometimes sitting <b>cross-legged</b> <b>on</b> a cushion. The reverse of their coins typically show Greek divinities.|$|E
25|$|After {{consolidating}} {{his political}} position through military campaigns, diplomacy, and a firm domestic administration, Suryavarman launched into {{the construction of}} Angkor Wat as his personal temple mausoleum. Breaking with {{the tradition of the}} Khmer kings, and influenced perhaps by the concurrent rise of Vaisnavism in India, he dedicated the temple to Vishnu rather than to Siva. With walls nearly half a mile long on each side, Angkor Wat grandly portrays the Hindu cosmology, with the central towers representing Mount Meru, home of the gods; the outer walls, the mountains enclosing the world; and the moat, the oceans beyond. The traditional theme of identifying the Khmer devaraja with the gods, and his residence with that of the celestials, is very much in evidence. The measurements themselves of the temple and its parts in relation to one another have cosmological significance. Suryavarman had the walls of the temple decorated with bas reliefs depicting not only scenes from mythology, but also from the life of his own imperial court. In one of the scenes, the king himself is portrayed as larger in size than his subjects, sitting <b>cross-legged</b> <b>on</b> an elevated throne and holding court, while a bevy of attendants make him comfortable with the aid of parasols and fans.|$|E
500|$|Once there, he sits <b>cross-legged</b> <b>on</b> his lily-pad and {{arranges}} his tackle. He has [...] "the dearest {{little red}} float". His rod is a stalk {{of grass and}} his line a horsehair. An hour passes without a nibble. He takes a break and lunches on a butterfly sandwich. A water beetle tweaks his toe causing him to withdraw his legs, and rats rustling about in the rushes force him to seek a safer location. He drops his line {{into the water and}} immediately has a bite. It is not a minnow but little Jack Sharp, a stickleback. The fish escapes but not before Jeremy pricks his fingers on Jack's spines. A shoal of little fishes come to the surface to laugh at Jeremy.|$|E
6000|$|After regaining {{his room}} last night nothing had struck him more {{forcibly}} than the needlessness of his words: [...] "Don't cry, Nollie!" [...] {{for he had}} realised with uneasiness {{that she had not}} been near crying. No; there was in her some emotion very different from the tearful. He kept seeing her <b>cross-legged</b> figure <b>on</b> the bed in that dim light; tense, enigmatic, almost Chinese; kept feeling the feverish touch of her lips. A good girlish burst of tears would have done her good, and been a guarantee. He had the uncomfortable conviction that his refusal had passed her by, as if unspoken. And, since he could not go and make music at that time of night, he had ended on his knees, in a long search for guidance, which was not vouchsafed him.|$|R
5|$|St Andrew's Church {{dates from}} the 12th century with a large 15th century pinnacled {{sandstone}} tower, a Norman font and a rood screen that is the full width of the church. In the church are several memorials to the Stracheys of Sutton Court together with a wooden effigy of a Knight <b>cross-legged</b> and leaning <b>on</b> one elbow, in 15th century armour, thought to be of Sir John de Hauteville or a descendant, and possibly transferred from a church at Norton Hautville before it was demolished.|$|R
50|$|The {{composer}} {{is shown}} in the guise of Orpheus, holding a lyre. Despite the classical allusion, he wears informal contemporary dress: a soft cap, a long shirt open at the neck, a full loose gown, and slippers, one of which lies beneath his right foot. His pose is also casual. He is seated <b>cross-legged,</b> leaning <b>on</b> a pile of bound scores of his works, including Alexander's Feast, which was completed the same month the statue was finished. The statue is unprecedented, for not only was the sitter portrayed with startling informality, but it was the first life-size marble depicting a living artist. Until this date such public statues were erected only for monarchs, noblemen or military leaders. Roubiliac was a native of France, although his known surviving work was executed in England. Handel is his earliest known independent sculpture. When it went on display in Vauxhall Gardens in 1738 it proved an immediate success, helping to establish Roubiliac as one of the leading sculptors in England.|$|R
500|$|After {{returning}} to England in May 1968, Lennon suggested that Cynthia take a holiday in Greece with Mardas, Donovan, Boyd, and her sister. Lennon {{said that he}} would be very busy recording what would become The White Album and that it would do her some good to take a break with Mardas, his girlfriend Jenny Boyd, and others. Cynthia arrived home one day early from Greece on 22 May 1968. She and Mardas discovered Lennon and Ono sitting <b>cross-legged</b> <b>on</b> the floor, staring into each other's eyes, and found Ono's slippers outside the Lennons' marital bedroom door. Cynthia asked Boyd and Mardas if she could spend the night at their apartment. At the apartment Boyd went straight to bed, but Mardas got Cynthia drunk and tried to convince her that they should both run away together. After Cynthia had vomited in the bathroom she collapsed on a bed in the spare bedroom, but Mardas joined her and tried to kiss her until she (in her words) [...] "pushed him away". Brian Epstein's personal assistant, Peter Brown, maintains that Cynthia did sleep with Mardas, saying: [...] "She knew it was a mistake the moment it happened, especially with Alex , whom she had never trusted, nor even liked".|$|E
500|$|During {{the flight}} back to England, Lennon got very drunk on Scotch and confessed {{that he had been}} {{involved}} with other women during their marriage. He went on to detail his liaisons with groupies, friends (such as Joan Baez, actress Eleanor Bron, journalist Cleave) and [...] "thousands" [...] of women around the globe. Although not wanting to hear Lennon's confession, she knew women were attracted to him, [...] "like moths to a flame". Two weeks later, in May 1968, Lennon suggested Cynthia take a holiday in Greece with Mardas, Donovan, and two friends, as he would be very busy recording songs for what would become The White Album. She arrived back at Kenwood from Greece earlier than expected, at 4 o'clock on 22 May 1968, to discover Lennon and Ono sitting <b>cross-legged</b> <b>on</b> the floor in matching white robes, staring into each other's eyes, and then found Ono's slippers outside the Lennons' bedroom door. Shocked, she asked Jenny Boyd and Mardas if she could spend the night at their apartment. At the apartment Boyd went straight to bed, but she and Mardas drank more alcohol, with Mardas trying to convince her to run away together. After she had vomited in the bathroom, she collapsed on a bed in the spare bedroom, with Mardas joining her and trying to kiss her until she pushed him away.|$|E
500|$|In 1968, Cynthia went on {{vacation}} to Greece, leaving Lennon at Kenwood with Shotton. After {{several days of}} taking LSD and smoking marijuana, Lennon convened {{a meeting at the}} Beatles' business HQ to inform the others that he felt he was the reincarnation of Jesus Christ. Later that day he phoned Ono, whose own husband Tony (Anthony Cox) was in Paris on business, and invited her to Kenwood. Shotton left the two alone, whereupon Lennon invited Ono (who had also taken LSD) up to the attic to hear his largely experimental non-Beatles' recordings. For the rest of the night, the two collaborated on what became the [...] album, and then [...] "made love at dawn", according to Lennon. Cynthia returned early from her vacation, and discovered Lennon and Ono sitting <b>cross-legged</b> <b>on</b> the floor and staring intently into each other's eyes (Ono was wearing one of Cynthia's bathrobes). In a state of shock, Cynthia then left to stay with friends for a few days, although Lennon and Cynthia were reconciled for a time upon her return to Kenwood. It was during Cynthia's next holiday in Italy that Lennon and Ono finally entered into a permanent relationship, and Lennon asked for a divorce. Cynthia, together with Julian and her mother, moved back into Kenwood for the summer, where Paul McCartney visited her to offer his support. On the journey to Kenwood he composed the song [...] "Hey Jude", which eventually became The Beatles' biggest selling single. Lennon and Ono, meanwhile, were without a permanent address for a time. They stayed with McCartney at his house in Cavendish Avenue (where it is alleged that a further breach occurred in the Lennon–McCartney relationship when Lennon discovered a derogatory note written by McCartney) and with Peter Brown and then Neil Aspinall, before moving into an apartment leased by Starr at 34 Montagu Square, Marylebone in London. They were evicted from this flat by the owner following a raid by the drug squad on 18 October 1968, and subsequent November trial, and so moved back into Kenwood for a short time, which had been vacated by Cynthia. In the new year Ono and Lennon moved into the Dorchester Hotel in London, leaving Kenwood for the last time.|$|E

5000|$|Eighteen sculptresses {{are in the}} Arhat hall (Luohan Ting; [...] ). These are sculpted as noble {{figures with}} amicable facial expressions. The {{garments}} {{are similar to the}} Cao Jiaxiang’s style and have received wide acclaim. The carved garments are tight fitting shirts over loose robes with broad sleeves. The most striking figure among the sculptures in the Arhat hall is that of the holy Guanyin style of sculpting which was popular during the later period of Chinese Buddhism. The gilded sculpted image of Bodhisattva of this period is shown in a <b>cross-legged</b> pose seated <b>on</b> a lotus. A Sumeru throne is sculpted below this image and is fixed over figures of mighty men. The statue is carved in a halo.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} erect sitting, slouched posture with cross-legged sitting, and erect posture with <b>cross-legged</b> sitting <b>on</b> the lumbar and pelvic angles, and gluteal pressure. [Subjects] For the ex-periments, 17 healthy women were recruited. [Methods] All {{subjects were asked to}} perform three sitting postures: erect sitting, slouched posture with cross-legged sitting, and erect posture with cross-legged sitting. Lumbar and pelvic angles were measured using a three-dimensional motion-capture system, and gluteal pressure was measured using a pressure mat. [Results] Compared to erector sitting, slouched posture with cross-legged sitting showed significantly greater lumbar flexion, posterior pelvic tilt, and left pelvic tilt. Compared to erect sitting, erect posture with cross-legged sitting showed significantly greater lumbar flexion and posterior pelvic tilt. Compared to erect posture with cross-legged sitting, slouched posture with cross-legged sitting showed significantly greater lumbar flexion and posterior pelvic tilt. Compared to erect sitting and erect posture with cross-legged sitting, slouched pos-ture with cross-legged sitting showed significantly greater left gluteal pressure; {{there was no significant difference}} in right gluteal pressure. [Conclusion] An erect posture can reduce changes in lumbar and pelvic angles, and gluteal pressure compared to a slouched posture during cross-legged sitting...|$|R
