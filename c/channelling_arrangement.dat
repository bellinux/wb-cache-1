However, countries of Region 1 {{will also be}} able to continue the use of these frequencies for their digital terrestrial television services, if necessary. This allocation will be effective immediately after the WRC- 15. The objective {{of this paper is to}} assess the electromagnetic compatibility of Digital Video Broadcasting - Terrestrial (DVB-T) operating below 694 MHz and mobile broadband (LTE) operating in 700 MHz band. The study contains an assumption of a preferred frequency division duplex (FDD) <b>channelling</b> <b>arrangement</b> which contains confined 2 x 30 MHz block: 703 - 733 MHz (uplink) and 758 - 788 MHz (downlink). The model consists of two elements, a LTE network and a DVB-T system. An adjacent channel scenario was analyzed in this paper: possible impact of LTE user equipment (uplink) to DVB-T receiver. The Minimum Coupling Loss method and Monte Carlo simulation within SEAMCAT software was used for interference analysis. The Minimum Coupling Loss method was chosen to calculate worst case (most conservative scenario) in order to understand most critical points of these two systems. The Monte Carlo simulations show more relaxed electromagnetic compatibility scenario. During simulations more appropriate propagation model was used (Recommendation ITU-R P. 1546), which allows to analyse also non line of sight radio propagation conditions. The results obtained provide the minimum coupling distance required between LTE and DVB-T in the 700 MHz band to maintain the necessary performance level of the DVB-T system...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the dynamics of}} export <b>channel</b> <b>arrangements</b> by modelling foreign operation method decisions as the interplay between factors that motivate switches and factors that deter them. Our model extends previous analyses by looking simultaneously at (1) no change of <b>channel</b> <b>arrangement,</b> (2) replacements of foreign intermediaries (within-mode shifts), and (3) integration of the sales function abroad (between-mode shifts). We use a multinomial logit model on longitudinal data from a sample of Danish exporters that had entered foreign markets through intermediaries. The {{results suggest that the}} decision to carry out within-mode shifts (i. e. to replace an existing intermediary) is driven by a different set of factors than the decision to switch to another foreign operation mode (i. e. to in-house operations).
