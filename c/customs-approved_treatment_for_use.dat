40|$|Background {{and aims}} This study {{examined}} the prevalence of, and factors associated with, men’s interest in seeking <b>treatment</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> of pornography. Methods Using an Internet-based data-collection procedure, we recruited 1, 298 male pornography users to complete questionnaires assessing demographic and sexual behaviors, hypersexuality, pornography-use characteristics, and current interest in seeking <b>treatment</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> of pornography. Results Approximately 14 % of men reported an interest in seeking <b>treatment</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> of pornography, whereas only 6. 4 % of men had previously sought <b>treatment</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> of pornography. Treatment-interested men were 9. 5 {{times more likely to}} report clinically significant levels of hypersexuality compared with treatment-disinterested men (OR[*]=[*] 9. 52, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 6. 72 – 13. 49). Bivariate analyses indicated that interest-in-seeking-treatment status was associated with being single/unmarried, viewing more pornography per week, engaging in more solitary masturbation in the past month, having had less dyadic oral sex in the past month, reporting a history of seeking <b>treatment</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> of pornography, and having had more past attempts to either “cut back” or quit using pornography completely. Results from a binary logistic regression analysis indicated that more frequent cut back/quit attempts with pornography and scores on the Hypersexual Behavior Inventory – Control subscale were significant predictors of interest-in-seeking-treatment status. Discussion and conclusions Study findings could be used to inform current screening practices aimed at identifying specific aspects of sexual self-control, impulsivity, and/or compulsivity associated with problematic use of pornography among treatment-seeking individuals...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Aims: Individuals in <b>treatment</b> <b>for</b> alcohol <b>use</b> {{disorders}} {{are more likely}} to die from cigarette use than from alcohol consumption. Advanced statistical methodologies that increase study power and clinical relevance have been advocated to examine the timevarying nature of substance use relapse and abstinence, including drinking and smoking. The purpose of this investigation was to examine timevarying factors that are associated with smoking cessation among smokers in the general population, including alcohol use, self-efficacy, and depression, to determine if they were also related to smoking cessation during and after <b>treatment</b> <b>for</b> alcohol <b>use</b> disorders. Methods: Data were garnered from Project MATCH, a longitudinal prospective study of the efficacy of three behavioural <b>treatments</b> <b>for</b> alcohol <b>use</b> disorders. Timevarying covariate analyses were conducted to examine future smoking cessation. Results: Results showed that greater self-efficacy regarding resisting temptations to drink and lower levels of depression were independently associated with increased likelihood of stopping smoking. In contrast, drinks per drinking day and confidence regarding not drinking did not demonstrate such associations. Conclusions: Clinical implications of these findings suggest that interventions to help alcoholics in recovery avoid temptations to drink, as well as decrease depression, may be warranted. By using advanced statistical techniques, these results can help clinicians and organizations working with smokers in <b>treatment</b> <b>for</b> alcohol <b>use</b> disorders to make informed decisions regarding how best to use limited resources...|$|R

40|$|Experiences and {{expectations}} of discrimination (anticipated discrimination) may delay treatment seeking among people with substance use disorders. In addition, experienced and anticipated discrimination can be a barrier to successful recovery and rehabilitation. The {{aim of this study}} was to study the level of experienced and anticipated (the expectation to be rejected) discrimination among individuals in <b>treatment</b> <b>for</b> substance <b>use</b> disorders as well as the association between both concepts of discrimination. In addition, the association of experienced and anticipated discrimination with clinical and social characteristics was investigated. A cross-sectional survey among individuals in <b>treatment</b> <b>for</b> substance <b>use</b> disorders in the Netherlands was carried out in 2012. Individuals in treatment (N = 186) completed a self-reported questionnaire about experienced and anticipated discrimination. Descriptive statistics and chi-squared analyses were performed to investigate the level of experienced and anticipated discrimination and the association between both concepts. Linear regression analyses were used to investigate the association with clinical and social characteristics, such as occupational status and type of treatment. Individuals in <b>treatment</b> <b>for</b> substance <b>use</b> disorders reported high levels of experienced and anticipated discrimination. Respondents experienced most discrimination in family ties, intimate relationships and friendships. Experienced and anticipated discrimination were both positively correlated. Having complex substance use problems and a longer history of substance use problems was related to higher levels of experienced discrimination. In conclusion, experienced and anticipated discrimination were highly prevalent among individuals in <b>treatment</b> <b>for</b> substance <b>use</b> disorders. Attention in addiction <b>treatment</b> <b>for</b> adequate coping with discrimination may be needed in order to achieve successful social participation and rehabilitation of these individuals...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Compared {{two groups}} of {{children}} with anxiety disorders served at a single mental health clinic whose referral source differed: private referrals (i. e., parent/legal guardian initiated) and public referrals (e. g., via state contracts—Departments of Health and Education, juvenile justice system).

However, large differences were evident for contextual variables like family income and life stressors.
