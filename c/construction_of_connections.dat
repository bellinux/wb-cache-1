"In anticipating and {{accounting}} for the war of expansion in the late 1930s the explanatory power of pressures which in their origin were economic was apparent to many actors and observers.

For the years 1938-39 a very wide variety of different types of sources materials discuss explicitly and at length the growing economic crisis in Germany, and many of the authors of these memoranda, books and articles could see the need to speculate then about the relationship between this crisis and the likelihood of war. The view that this was a major problem was common to many top military and political leaders in Germany, to top officials in Britain, to some German industrialists and civil servants, to German exiles and members of the conservative resistance, and to non-German bankers and academics.|$|E

We also apply the theory to finite sets and in particular to finite group function algebras C[G] with differential calculi and Killing forms determined by a conjugacy class. The case of the permutation group C[S 3] is worked out in full detail and a unique torsion free and cotorsion free or ‘Levi-Civita ’ connection is obtained with noncommutative Ricci curvature essentially proportional to the metric (an Einstein space). We also construct Dirac operators D / in the metric background, including on finite groups such as S 3.

40|$|We compute {{multi-string}} interaction vertices by sewing {{of basic}} string interaction vertex operators, so called dual Reggeon vertex operators. These operators describe {{the interaction between}} two complete external string sectors. They are particularly useful when the interactions involve twisted sectors. In paper I we check the dual vertex formalism by sewing multi-loop interactions in the bosonic string. We also construct the dual Reggeon vertex describing the interaction between a twisted and an untwisted bosonic string sektor. In papers II to IV we compute the string interaction vertex describing the interaction between two twisted fermion sectors of the RNS string. Nearby conformal field theories can be connected by so called marginal deformations. Papers V and VI deal with the regularization of such marginal deformations and the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>connections</b> on spaces of conformal field theories. The papers I to VI concern various aspects of string field theory. Sewing of Reggeon vertex operators may {{be thought of as}} interactions between second quantized strings fields.

40|$|In {{this study}} an interpretive {{learning}} framework {{that aims to}} measure learning on the classroom level is introduced. In order to develop and evaluate {{the value of the}} framework, a theoretical/empirical study is designed. The researcher attempted to illustrate how the proposed framework provides insights on the problem of classroom-level learning. The framework is developed by <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>connections</b> between the current literature on science learning and Wittgenstein 2 ̆ 7 s language-game theory. In this framework learning is defined as change of classroom language-game or discourse. In the proposed framework, learning is measured by analysis of classroom discourse. The empirical explanation power of the framework is evaluated by applying the framework in the analysis of learning in a fifth-grade science classroom. The researcher attempted to analyze how students 2 ̆ 7 colloquial discourse changed to a discourse that bears more resemblance to science discourse. The results of the empirical part of the investigation are presented in three parts: first, the gap between what students did and what they were supposed to do was reported. The gap showed that students during the classroom inquiry wanted to do simple comparisons by direct observation, while they were supposed to do tool-assisted observation and procedural manipulation for a complete comparison. Second, it was illustrated that the first attempt to connect the colloquial to science discourse was done by what was immediately intelligible for students and then the teacher negotiated with students in order to help them to connect the old to the new language-game more purposefully. The researcher suggested that these two events in the science classroom are critical in discourse change. Third, it was illustrated that through the academic year, the way that students did the act of comparison was improved {{and by the end of}} the year more accurate causal inferences were observable in classroom communication. At the end of the study, the researcher illustrates that the application of the proposed framework resulted in an improved version of the framework. The improved version of the proposed framework is more connected to the topic of science learning, and is able to measure the change of discourse in higher resolution...|$|E
