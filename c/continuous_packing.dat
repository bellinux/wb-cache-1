In this new approach, the conventional grading model for <b>continuous</b> <b>packing</b> was modified taking into account the difference in grain shape between crushed and natural aggregates, and the specific area of fine materials measured by the BET method was used for calculating the need of additional water for lubrication of fine particles. The results from four trial mixes show that this additional water is corresponding to 30 - 60 molecular layers.

40|$|Packing density, {{the fiber}} {{distribution}} in a yarn cross section, can {{to a great}} extent influence the properties and quality of the yarn. Thus, the need for precise and concise information about packing density becomes a must for an in-depth understanding of yarn structure and hence yarn mechanics. This paper describes a detailed method for determining packing density. We begin by acquiring yarn cross-sectional images to provide input data for calculating yarn cross-sectional packing density. These data include the coordinates of each fiber center and fiber radius. A program whose general writing algorithm is also elaborated in detail is compiled to calculate the packing ratio zone by zone. With these discrete packing ratios, a curve-fitting technique yields a <b>continuous</b> <b>packing</b> density function. In addition, a study of the relationship between packing density and yarn parameters such as yarn count and twist factor is included. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E
40|$|The <b>continuous</b> <b>packing</b> of a {{flexible}} rod in two-dimensional cavities yields a countable set of interacting domains that resembles non-equilibrium cellular systems and {{belongs to a}} new class of light-weight material. However, the link between the length of the rod and the number of domains requires investigation {{especially in the case of}} non-simply connected cavities, where the number of avoided regions emulates an effective topological temperature. In the present article we report the results of an experiment of injection of a single flexible rod into annular cavities in order to find the total length needed to insert a given number of loops (domains of one vertex). Using an exponential model to describe the experimental data we quite minutely analyze the initial conditions, the intermediary behavior, and the tight-packing limit. This method allows the observation of a new fluctuation phenomenon associated with instabilities in the dynamic evolution of the packing process. Furthermore, the fractal dimension of the global pattern enters the discussion under a novel point of view. A comparison with the classical problems of the random close packing of disks, and jammed disk packings is made. Comment: 19 pages, 14 equations, 8 figure...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} meet demands for faster and more {{efficient}} data processing, modern microprocessors are being designed with lower voltage implementations. The <b>continuous</b> <b>packing</b> of more devices on a single processor chip is increasing its current demands calling for an aggressive power management. These demands, in turn require special power supplies to provide lower voltages with higher currents capabilities for microprocessors. This work presents a modified low voltage high current Voltage Regulator Module (VRM) technology for desktop computers, and portable applications. The developed advanced VRM has advantages over conventional ones in power efficiency and reliability. The SMPS outputs of desktop computers are mainly 5, 12. Considering the factor of distribution loss for today’s processors + 12 V input supply is used instead of + 5 V and then it is step down to 1. 2 V. To make this dc/dc conversion efficient at lower voltages, synchronous converter is an obvious choice because of lower conduction loss in the diode. Primarily the various losses occurring in Synchronous Buck Converter (SBC) is analyzed mathematically. The results conclude {{the dominance of the}} switching loss on the high side MOSFET. ZVT, the most efficient among the soft switching techniques is employed to the SBC. The suggested Zero Voltage Transition (ZVT) Single Phase SBC is simulated using PSIM for design values of 3. 3 V, 12 A output and switching frequency 200 kHz. The proposed converter exhibits an efficient performance in comparison with the conventional converter. Additionally, the resonant auxiliary circuit in ZVT, which conducts {{for a short period of}} time, is also devoid of the switching loss.

The parameters considered were contact time and adsorbent dose, thermal pre-treatment of adsorbent, initial fluoride concentration and pH. The adsorption was rapid during the initial 20 min, but significant amount (> 90 %) was removed within one hour at an optimum adsorbent dose of 1. 6 g/L for initial F- concentration of 20 mg/L. The removal {{efficiency of}} F was increased with adsorbent dosage. Fluoride adsorption efficiencies increase with increase in the thermal treatment temperature up to 200 ° C, but further increase in temperature resulted in decreased removal efficiency. For application in <b>continuous</b> <b>packed</b> bed column, treatment at 300 ° C was taken as an optimum value. Fluoride adsorption capacity increases linearly with increase in F - concentration.

40|$|Effluents {{discharged}} from tannery industry contain {{significant amount of}} chromium and synthetic dyes. Both chromium and dyes can be transformed individually into less toxic forms, but very {{little is known about}} their simultaneous treatment. The present study was aimed at isolating bacteria capable of removing toxic hexavalent chromium (CrVI) and reactive black- 5 azo dye simultaneously in liquid mineral salt medium (MSM). About 150 bacterial isolates were collected from tannery wastewater and sludge through enrichment of the MSM with CrVI (2 mg L. 1) and reactive black- 5 dye (100 mg L. 1) under static (batch) condition. Bacterial strains KI (Pseudomonas putida) and SL 14 (Serratia proteamaculans) were able to reduce simultaneously 93 % CrVI and 100 % color of reactive black- 5 azo dye in 24 h at pH 7. 2 and 35 oC, in the presence of yeast extract as a cosubstrate. Individually, 100 % reduction of CrVI and reactive black- 5 dye was achieved within 12 h by strain KI and SL 14. Bacterial strains were also able to reduce both contaminants at high concentration of salt (up to 50 g NaCl L- 1). Addition of trace elements Fe(II), Ag(I), Mn(II), Hg(II), Ba(II) and Li(I) had inhibitory effect on the reduction of reactive black- 5 and CrVI while the reduction efficiency of the strains increased in the presence of Cu(II). The almost complete (~ 100 %) reduction of the dye and CrVI was achieved by strain KI in 18 h at 5 mg L- 1 Cu(II) concentration. In the presence of low concentration (1 mmol L- 1), hydroquinone and uric acid electron complexes strain KI was able to reduce 100 % dye and 92 - 97 % CrVI within 12 h and 18 h, respectively. Potential of selected bacterial strains was also tested either individually or in consortium to degrade eight structurally different azo dyes and CrVI. Complete decolorization of six dyes (reactive black- 5, golden ovifix, direct black- 38, direct red- 81, navy blue, acid red- 88) and 85 - 100 % reduction in CrVI was observed with strain KI in 12 and 24 h. The bacterial consortia were less effective than the individual strains (KI, SL 14 and BW 3). The most efficient strain KI capable of reducing both dyes and CrVI simultaneously was finally tested in batch and <b>continuous</b> <b>packed</b> bed bioreactors. The biochar prepared from corn cob at 400 oC was used as a packing material in the reactor columns due to its high specific surface area (1275 m 2 g- 1), porosity (2. 5 Æ’ÃŠm) and support to facultative cells growth (3. 86 x 10 19 cfu g- 1). Complete degradation (100 %) of 100 mg dye L- 1 occurred in 5 h in <b>continuous</b> <b>packed</b> bed bioreactor while 20 h were required for complete degradation of the dye in batch bioreactor. Moreover, strain KI was able to reduce completely 300 mg dye L- 1 and 10 mg CrVI L- 1 within 24 h in <b>continuous</b> <b>packed</b> bed bioreactor. Aniline (10 mg L- 1), a by-product of reactive black- 5, also degraded completely without CrVI while its degradation was 84 % in case of simultaneous treatment.

Continuous processes offer various advantages such as reduction in sterilization and inoculation time, high productivity, and reduction in butanol inhibition, but this reactor presents high product recovery costs due to low concentration of biofuel [26].

When the fermentation culture consumes the substrate, more substrate is added to maintain the fermentation process while not exceeding the detrimental substrate level [53]. The usage of a <b>continuous</b> <b>packed</b> bed reactor (PBR) is reported as an alternative for fermentation using immobilized microorganism [34]. Lu et al.

In this process, effective parameters required for a <b>continuous</b> <b>packed</b> bed model were identified and used for continuum simulation. This approach is validated by comparing the simulated results with experimental data from another test rig. The presented method significantly simplifies subsequent design studies...|$|R

Phenol is an important commodity for the chemical industry, used for many processes and deemed {{to be a major}} pol-lutant due to its xenobiotic nature and high toxicity. For the purpose of phenol bioremediation a biotechnological set up consisting of a <b>continuous</b> <b>packed</b> column bioreactor with Candida tropicalis adhered onto activated carbon beads has been previously described. In this work, we show how the integration of available experimental data of such a biotech-nological set up into a mathematical model, can lead both to a better comprehension of the underlying physiological mechanisms operating in the cell culture, and to the identification of the system parameters optimum performance. The model so constructed describes the dynamics of phenol uptake and growth rates by the adhered and suspended biomass; the lethality rates; the adhered biomass removal into suspension or adherence onto carbon beads rates and the phenol and biomass (adhered and suspended) concentrations. It also serves to identify different physiological states for the ad-hered and the suspended biomass; its predictions being verified by comparing with experimental observations. Based on the model description, different optimization strategies are proposed, some of which have been experimentally tested...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was the study of iron {{extraction}} from sulphate aqueous solutions by liquid-liquid extraction, using a mixture of di(2 -ethylhexil) phosphoric acid (DEHPA) and a primary amine (JMT). The presence of the amine shows a synergetic effect in the iron re-extraction allowing the use of stripping solutions of low acidity. Equilibrium {{studies were carried out}} in order to identify the optimal experimental conditions for iron removal and to establish the reaction stoichiometry. To evaluate the extraction kinetics an agitated cell with constant area was used. It was also necessary to perform the speciation in iron sulphate solution to interpret the results. The extraction process was afterwards tested in a <b>continuous</b> <b>packed</b> column. These experiments examine the influence upon the extraction efficiency of the initial iron content in the aqueous phase (0, 179 - 0, 354 M), of the pH (1, 0 - 2, 5) and of the ratio between the flow rates. The axial dispersion model was applied in order to simulate the concentration profiles. The results obtained show {{that it is possible to}} predict iron concentration in the aqueous phase with a standard deviation error of 4 %Available from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

Organic pollutants, like phenol, along with heavymetals, like chromium, are present in various industrial effluents that pose serious health hazard to humans. The present study looked at removal of chromium (VI) in presence of phenol in a counter-current <b>continuous</b> <b>packed</b> bed reactor packedwith E. coli cells immobilized on clay chips. The cells removed 85 % of 500 mg/L of chromium (VI) from MS media containing glucose. Glucose was then replaced by 500 mg/L phenol. Temperature and pH of the MS media prior to addition of phenol were 30 ∘C and 7, respectively. Hydraulic retention times of phenol- and chromium (VI) -containing synthetic media and air flow rates were varied to study the removal efficiency of the reactor system. Then temperature conditions of the reactor system were varied from 10 ∘C to 50 ∘C, the optimum being 30 ∘C. The pH of the media was varied from pH 1 to pH 12, and the optimum pHwas found to be 7. Themaximum removal efficiency of 77. 7 % was achieved for synthetic media containing phenol and chromium (VI) in the continuous reactor system at optimized conditions, namely, hydraulic retention time at 4. 44 hr, air flow rate at 2. 5 lpm, temperature at 30 ∘C, and pH at 7. 1...|$|R
40|$|A unique cascade {{facility}} is described {{which makes it}} possible to use LDV for measuring blade boundary layer profiles. Because of the need for a laser access window, the facility cannot rely on <b>continuous</b> blade <b>pack</b> suction to achieve stable flow. Instead, a combination of tailboards and strong suction upstream of the blade pack is used to create a two-dimensional periodic flow field at a chord Reynolds number of 500, 000. The distribution of the upstream suction is controlled through a complex baffling system. Details of the inlet and outlet flow are documented using five-hole pressure probes, blade static-pressure measurements, and sublimation flow visualization. Experimental data are presented on the flow field on the suction surface of the blade, the pressure surface, and near-wake flow fields...|$|R
