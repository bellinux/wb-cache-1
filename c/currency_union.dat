5|$|The Wall Street Journal conjectured as {{well that}} Germany could return to the Deutsche Mark, or create another <b>currency</b> <b>union</b> with the Netherlands, Austria, Finland, Luxembourg and other European {{countries}} such as Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the Baltics. A monetary union of these countries with current account surpluses would create the world's largest creditor bloc, bigger than China or Japan. The Wall Street Journal added that without the German-led bloc, a residual euro would have the flexibility to keep interest rates low and engage in quantitative easing or fiscal stimulus {{in support of a}} job-targeting economic policy instead of inflation targeting in the current configuration.|$|E
5|$|The {{detailed}} {{causes of}} the debt crisis varied. In several countries, private debts arising from a property bubble were transferred to sovereign debt {{as a result of}} banking system bailouts and government responses to slowing economies post-bubble. The structure of the eurozone as a <b>currency</b> <b>union</b> (i.e., one currency) without fiscal union (e.g., different tax and public pension rules) contributed to the crisis and limited the ability of European leaders to respond. European banks own a significant amount of sovereign debt, such that concerns regarding the solvency of banking systems or sovereigns are negatively reinforcing.|$|E
5|$|The first {{televised}} prime ministerial {{debate was}} organised by the state-owned broadcaster Finnish Broadcasting Company on 31 March in Tampere and included the chairpersons {{of the four}} parties leading in the opinion polls. The European sovereign debt crisis featured prominently in the debate; {{the leaders of the}} governing coalition, Katainen and Kiviniemi, defended Finland's participation in guaranteeing the loans to crisis-ridden EU countries claiming that Finland would otherwise risk plunging into a new recession as the country is dependent on exports to other European countries. As the chairpersons of the leading opposition parties, Soini and Urpilainen denied this claim and insisted that the debt-ridden countries should rather be allowed to go into their own debt restructuring. Urpilainen was not entirely against emergency measures aimed at saving these countries, but insisted that the major European banks ought to play a larger role in the guarantees. Soini continued his criticism of the euro, reiterating that no referendum was ever called on the <b>currency</b> <b>union</b> — he remained steadfast on his party's opposition to Finland guaranteeing the loans and presented the upcoming election as a referendum on the issue. On other economic issues, Kiviniemi continued to insist that spending cuts are not necessary in the following years — a claim repudiated by the other party leaders. Urpilainen and, initially, also Katainen were willing to make cuts on military spending; Soini, however, contested the cut but was instead ready to cut development aid and immigration-related expenses.|$|E
40|$|<b>Currency</b> <b>unions</b> (also {{known as}} {{monetary}} unions) are groups {{of countries that}} share a single money. <b>Currency</b> <b>unions</b> are unusual, since most countries have their own currency.

40|$|This paper {{employs a}} new method and dataset to {{estimate}} the effect of <b>currency</b> <b>unions</b> on the integration of financial markets in late Medieval Central Europe. The analysis reveals that membership in a union was significantly correlated with well-integrated markets. We also examine whether <b>currency</b> <b>unions</b> were endogenous. Our results indicate that where unions were established, markets had been significantly better integrated already in the preceding period. In addition, we show that <b>currency</b> <b>unions</b> created by autonomous merchant towns were better integrated than unions implemented by territorial rulers. The overall implication is that monetary diversity was a corollary of weakly integrated markets in late Medieval Central Europe.

40|$|Preliminary draft, {{please do}} not cite This paper revisits the link between {{exchange}} rate regimes and trade {{in the context of}} Africa’s exchange rate arrangements. Using an augmented gravity model that includes measures of <b>currency</b> <b>unions</b> as well as direct and indirect fixed exchange rates, the paper benchmarks Africa’s experience with that of the rest of world. Our results suggest that fixed exchange rate regimes in the form of <b>currency</b> <b>unions</b> or direct pegs promote trade in Africa: the effect of <b>currency</b> <b>unions</b> and direct fixed exchange rates on Africa’s bilateral trade is almost double than that for an average country in the world sample. In addition, we find that the effect of <b>currency</b> <b>unions</b> depends more on the geographical proximity of the trading partners in Africa than in the world, with member countries closer to each other reaping more trade gains. Finally, <b>currency</b> <b>unions</b> make trade more stable in Africa and affect the volume of trade through channels other than reduced exchange rate volatility.

40|$|This paper {{finds that}} <b>currency</b> <b>unions</b> and direct {{exchange}} rate pegs raise trade through distinct channels. Panel data {{analysis of the}} period 1973 - 2000 indicates that <b>currency</b> <b>unions</b> have raised trade predominantly at the extensive margin, the entry of new firms or products. In contrast, direct pegs have worked almost entirely at the intensive margin, increased trade of existing products. A stochastic general equilibrium model is developed to understand this result, featuring price stickiness and firm entry under uncertainty. Because both regimes tend to reliably provide exchange rate stability over the horizon of a year or so, which is the horizon of price setting, they both lead to lower export prices and greater demand for exports. But because <b>currency</b> <b>unions</b> historically are more durable over a longer horizon than pegs, they encourage firms to make the longer-term investment needed to enter a new market. The model predicts that when exchange rate uncertainty is completely and permanently eliminated, all of the adjustment in trade should occur at the extensive margin. ...|$|R
