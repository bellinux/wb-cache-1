Gel treatments usually reduce the permeability to water {{to a greater extent than}} the permeability to oil is reduced.

Greater DPR was observed as the concentrations of polymer and chromium were increased. A conceptual model of the mechanisms responsible for DPR is presented. Primary features of the model are (1) the development of flow channels through the gel by dehydration and displacement of the gel and by re-connection of pre-treatment, residual oil volume and (2) high flow resistance in the channels during water flow is caused by significant saturations of oil remaining in the channels. A similar study of DPR was conducted in Berea sandstone cores. Both oil and water permeabilities were reduced by much smaller factors in Berea sandstone cores than in similar treatments in sandpacks.

Gelation occurs by network formation through the crosslinking of polyacrylamide molecules as a result of reaction with <b>chromium</b> <b>acetate.</b> The initial reaction between <b>chromium</b> <b>acetate</b> and one polymer {{is referred to as the}} uptake reaction. The uptake reaction was studied as functions of chromium and polymer concentrations and pH values. Experimental data were regressed to determine a rate equation that describes the uptake reaction of chromium by polyacrylamide. Pre-gel aggregates form and grow as the reactions between <b>chromium</b> <b>acetate</b> and polyacrylamide proceed. A statistical model that describes the growth of pre-gel aggregates was developed using the theory of branching processes. The model gives molecular weight averages that are expressed as functions of the conversion of the reactive sites on <b>chromium</b> <b>acetate</b> or on the polymer molecule. Results of the application of the model correlate well with experimental data of viscosity and weight-average molecular weight and gives insights into the gelation process. A third study addresses the flow of water and oil in rock material after a gel treatment. Previous works have shown that gel treatments usually reduce the permeability to water to a greater extent than the permeability to oil is reduced. This phenomenon is referred to as disproportionate permeability reduction (DPR). Flow experiments were conducted to determine the effect of polymer and chromium concentrations on DPR. All gels studied reduced the permeability to water by a greater factor than the factor by which the oil permeability was reduced. Greater DPR was observed as the concentrations of polymer and chromium were increased. Increased pressure gradients during oil flow decreased the oil permeability and the water permeability that was measured afterward. Lower pressure gradients that were applied subsequently moderately affected water permeabilities but did not affect oil permeabilities.

40|$|Gelled polymer {{treatments}} {{are applied to}} oil reservoirs to increase oil production and to reduce water production by altering the fluid movement within the reservoir. This report describes {{the results of a}} three-year research program aimed at reducing barriers to the widespread use of gelled polymer treatments by (1) developing methods to predict gel behavior during placement in matrix rock and fractures, (2) determining the persistence of permeability reduction after gel placement, and (3) developing methods to design production well treatments to control water production. The work focused on the gel system composed of polyacrylamide and <b>chromium</b> <b>acetate.</b> The molar mass of the polymer was about six million. Chromium(III) acetate reacted and formed crosslinks between polymer molecules. The crosslinked polymer molecules, or pre-gel aggregates, combine and grow to eventually form a 3 -dimensional gel. A fundamental study to characterize the formation and growth of pre-gel aggregates was conducted. Two methods, flow field-flow fractionation (FFFF) and multi-angle laser light scattering (MALLS) were used. Studies using FFFF were inconclusive. Data taken using MALLS showed that at the gel time the average molar mass of gel aggregates increased by a factor of about three while the average size increase was approximately 50 %. Increased acetate concentration in the gelant increases the gel time. The in situ performance of an added-acetate system was investigated to determine the applicability for in-depth treatments. Increased acetate concentrations delayed the development of increased flow resistance during gelant injection in short sandpacks. The development of increased flow resistance (in situ gelation) was extended from 2 to 34 days by increasing the acetate-to-chromium ratio from 38 to 153. In situ gelation occurred at a time that was approximately 22 % of the bulk gelation time. When carbonate rocks are treated with gel, chromium retention in the rock may limit in-depth treatment. Chromium retention due to precipitation was investigated by flowing <b>chromium</b> <b>acetate</b> solutions through carbonate rock. Chromium precipitated faster in the rocks than in beaker experiments at similar conditions. A mathematical model previously developed fit the precipitation data reasonably well. The stability of gels when subjected to stress was investigated by experiments with gels placed in tubes and in laboratory-scale fractures. Rupture pressures for gels placed in small diameter tubes were correlated with the ratio of tube length to tube ID. In fractures, fluid leakoff from the fracture to adjacent matrix rock affected gel formation and gel stability in a positive way. Disproportionate permeability reduction (DPR) was studied in unconsolidated sandpacks and in Berea sandstone cores. A conceptual model was developed to explain the presence of DPR. The effect of a pressure gradient, imposed by injection of oil or brine, on the permeability of gel-treated cores was investigated. DPR increased significantly as the pressure gradient was decreased.

A weaker response {{in the absence of}} microsomal enzymes was observed with hydroxyurea (only at high doses) and the soluble Cr(VI) compounds potassium chromate and potassium dichromate. No effect was observed with ampicillin, cadmium chloride, cyclophosphamide, griseofulvin, the insoluble Cr(VI) compound lead chromate, the soluble Cr(III) compounds chromium nitrate, chromium chloride, chromium potassium sulphate, and the chelating agent sodium nitrilotriacetate.

Using urinary XAD- 2 extracts, we found the SOS Chromotest poorly sensitive to the mutagens present in urine from tobacco smokers which, on the other hand, were detected by the gene mutation assay in Salmonella typhimurium (Ames test). A urine sample obtained from a psoriatic patient, therapeutically treated with mineral coal tar, had a significant SOS inducing activity with and even without metabolic activation, whereas in the Ames test it was active only in the presence of metabolic activation.

The thermal stability of the nanocomposite gel and the conventional gel system were also determined by thermogravimetric analysis. The graft polymer nanocomposite gel system exhibited acceptable gel strength, gelation time and gel stability compared with the conventional gel system. The nanocomposite gels prepared using a low crosslinker concentration showed higher gel strength and required longer gelation time than the conventional gel which is more desirable properties for the effective placement of gel during enhanced oil recovery operations. In addition, sand pack flooding experiments show that the graft polymer nanocomposite gels had better plugging capacity than the conventional gel systems under reservoir conditions.

40|$|Gelation {{technologies}} {{have been developed}} to provide more efficient vertical sweep efficiencies for flooding naturally fractured oil reservoirs or more efficient areal sweep efficiency for those with high permeability contrast ''thief zones''. The field proven alkaline-surfactant-polymer technology economically recovers 15 % to 25 % OOIP more oil than waterflooding from swept pore space of an oil reservoir. However, alkaline-surfactant-polymer technology is not amenable to naturally fractured reservoirs or those with thief zones because much of injected solution bypasses target pore space containing oil. This work investigates whether combining these two technologies could broaden applicability of alkaline-surfactant-polymer flooding into these reservoirs. A prior fluid-fluid report discussed interaction of different gel chemical compositions and alkaline-surfactant-polymer solutions. Gel solutions under dynamic conditions of linear corefloods showed similar stability to alkaline-surfactant-polymer solutions as in the fluid-fluid analyses. Aluminum-polyacrylamide, flowing gels are not stable to alkaline-surfactant-polymer solutions of either pH 10. 5 or 12. 9. Chromium acetate-polyacrylamide flowing and rigid flowing gels are stable to subsequent alkaline-surfactant-polymer solution injection. Rigid flowing chromium acetate-polyacrylamide gels maintained permeability reduction better than flowing chromium acetate-polyacrylamide gels. Silicate-polyacrylamide gels are not stable with subsequent injection of either a pH 10. 5 or a 12. 9 alkaline-surfactant-polymer solution. Chromium acetate-xanthan gum rigid gels are not stable to subsequent alkaline-surfactant-polymer solution injection. Resorcinol-formaldehyde gels were stable to subsequent alkaline-surfactant-polymer solution injection. When evaluated in a dual core configuration, injected fluid flows into the core with the greatest effective permeability to the injected fluid. The same gel stability trends to subsequent alkaline-surfactant-polymer injected solution were observed. Aluminum citrate-polyacrylamide, resorcinol-formaldehyde, and the silicate-polyacrylamide gel systems did not produce significant incremental oil in linear corefloods. Both flowing and rigid flowing chromium acetate-polyacrylamide gels and the xanthan gum-chromium acetate gel system produced incremental oil with the rigid flowing gel producing the greatest amount. Higher oil recovery could have been due to higher differential pressures across cores. None of the gels tested appeared to alter alkaline-surfactant-polymer solution oil recovery. Total waterflood plus chemical flood oil recovery sequence recoveries were all similar. Chromium acetate-polyacrylamide gel used to seal fractured core maintain fracture closure if followed by an alkaline-surfactant-polymer solution. <b>Chromium</b> <b>acetate</b> gels that were stable to injection of alkaline-surfactant-polymer solutions at 72 F were stable to injection of alkaline-surfactant-polymer solutions at 125 F and 175 F in linear corefloods. Chromium acetate-polyacrylamide gels maintained diversion capability after injection of an alkaline-surfactant-polymer solution in stacked; radial coreflood with a common well bore. Xanthan gum-chromium acetate gels maintained gel integrity in linear corefloods after injection of an alkaline-surfactant-polymer solution at 125 F. At 175 F, Xanthan gum-chromium acetate gels were not stable either with or without subsequent alkaline-surfactant-polymer solution injection. Numerical simulation demonstrated that reducing the permeability of a high permeability zone of a reservoir with gel improved both waterflood and alkaline-surfactant-polymer flood oil recovery. A Minnelusa reservoir with both A and B sand production was simulated. A and B sands are separated by a shale layer.

40|$|Gelation {{technologies}} {{have been developed}} to provide more efficient vertical sweep efficiencies for flooding naturally fractured oil reservoirs or reservoirs with different sand lenses with high permeability contrast. The field proven alkaline-surfactant-polymer technology economically recovers 15 % to 25 % OOIP more crude oil than waterflooding froin swept pore space of an oil reservoir. However, alkaline-surfactant-polymer technology is not amenable to naturally fractured reservoirs or reservoirs with high permeability contrast zones because much of injected solution bypasses target pore space containing oil. This work investigates whether combining these two technologies could broaden applicability of alkaline-surfactant-polymer flooding into these reservoirs. Fluid-fluid interaction with different gel chemical compositions and alkaline-surfactant-polymer solution with pH values ranging from 9. 2 to 12. 9 have been tested. Aluminum-polyacrylamide gels are not stable to alkaline-surfactant-polymer solutions at any pH. Chromium-polyacrylamide gels with polymer to chromium ion ratios of 25 or greater were stable to alkaline-surfactant-polymer solutions if solution pH was 10. 6 or less. When the polymer to chromium ion was 15 or less, chromium-polyacrylamide gels were stable to alkaline-surfactant-polymer solutions with pH values up to 12. 9. Chromium-xanthan gum gels were stable to alkaline-surfactant-polymer solutions with pH values of 12. 9 at the polymer to chromium ion ratios tested. Silicate-polyacrylamide, resorcinol-formaldehyde, and sulfomethylated resorcinol-formaldehyde gels were also stable to alkaline-surfactant-polymer solutions with pH values ranging from 9. 2 to 12. 9. Iron-polyacrylamide gels were immediately destroyed when contacted with any of the alkaline-surfactant-polymer solutions with pH values ranging from 9. 2 to 12. 9. Gel solutions under dynamic conditions of linear corefloods showed similar stability to alkaline-surfactant-polymer solutions as in the fluid-fluid analyses {{with the exception of the}} xanthan gum-chromium acetate gels. Aluminum-polyacrylamide flowing gels are not stable to alkaline-surfactant-polymer solutions of either pH 10. 5 or 12. 9, either in linear corefloods or in dual separate radial core, common manifold corefloods. Chromium acetate-polyacrylamide flowing and rigid tonguing gels are stable to subsequent alkaline-surfactant-polymer solution injection. Rigid tonguing chromium acetate-polyacrylamide gels maintained permeability reduction better than flowing chromium acetate-polyacrylamide gels. <b>Chromium</b> <b>acetate</b> gels were stable to injection of alkaline-surfactant-polymer solutions at 72 F, 125 F and 175 F in linear corefloods. Chromium acetate-polyacrylamide gels maintained diversion capability after injection of an alkaline-surfactant-polymer solution in stacked; radial coreflood with a common well bore. Chromium acetate-polyacrylamide gel used to seal fractured core maintain fracture closure if followed by an alkaline-surfactant-polymer solution. Chromium acetate-xanthan gum rigid gels are not stable to subsequent alkaline-surfactant-polymer solution injection at 72, 125, and 175 F. Silicate-polyacrylamide gels are not stable with subsequent injection of either a pH 10. 5 or a 12. 9 alkaline-surfactant-polymer solution. Resorcinol-formaldehyde gels were stable to subsequent alkaline-surfactant-polymer solution injection. When evaluated in a dual core configuration, injected fluid flows into the core with the greatest effective permeability to the injected fluid. The same gel stability trends to subsequent alkaline-surfactant-polymer injected solution were observed. Aluminum citrate-polyacrylamide, resorcinol-formaldehyde, and the silicate-polyacrylamide gel systems did not produce significant incremental oil in linear corefloods. Both flowing and rigid tonguing chromium acetate-polyacrylamide gels and the xanthan gum-chromium acetate gel system produced incremental oil with the rigid tonguing gel producing the greatest amount. Higher oil recovery could have been due to higher differential pressures across cores. Aluminum citrate-polyacrylamide gels, chromium acetate-polyacrylamide gels, silicate-polymer, and chromium-xanthan guin gels did not alter an alkaline-surfactant-polymer solution's ability to produce incremental oil. Incremental oil was reduced with the resorcinol-formaldehyde gel system. Total waterflood plus chemical flood oil recovery sequence recoveries were generally similar...|$|E
40|$|The {{catalytic}} {{performance of}} Cr-ZSM- 5 catalysts prepared by solid-state reaction from different <b>chromium</b> salts (<b>acetate,</b> chloride, nitrate and ammonium dichromate) was evaluated in the selective ammoxidation of ethylene to produce acetonitrile. Cr-ZSM- 5 catalyst characterization by chemical analysis, XRD, FTIR, N- 2 physisorption, Al- 27 MAS NMR, TEM/EDX, UV-visible DRS, XPS, Raman and DRIFT spectroscopies and H- 2 -TPR is reported. From textural analysis, it is obvious, after chromium exchange, that {{a decrease of}} S-BET and of porous volume is observed. On the other hand, FTIR. XRD and Al- 27 MAS NMR results {{show that there is}} no collapse of the parent zeolite during thermal treatment. From H 2 -TPR, DRS, Raman and XPS spectroscopies, it is concluded that Cr ions and Cr(III) oxide coexist. TEM/EDX results confirmed that chromium oxide species are either heterogeneously or homogeneously dispersed on the support, depending {{on the nature of the}} precursor. DRIFT showed that chromium exchange leads strictly to the consumption of Si-O+H-Al groups. The catalyst prepared from chromium chloride showed higher activity and selectivity towards acetonitrile, being this catalytic modification probably due to the differentiated nature of chromium species formed using this precursor. A similarity with Fe-ZSM- 5 system is underlined. In fact, higher oxidation states of chromium species are required for ethylene ammoxidation, while Cr 2 O 3 clusters seem to enhance the hydrocarbon oxidation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{comprised}} of two related projects: a viscosity variability study and a trivalent cation study. For the first study, the dependence of viscosity of solutions of the polymer sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) on temperature was quantitatively determined so that the viscosity measurements from four sets of viscosity versus age of solution data could be normalized. The four sets of age of solution data were obtained for two solutions containing Al cation and for two solutions containing Mg cation. The temperature normalization procedure proved viable. Factoring out the variability due to temperature led to a decrease in overall variability of the viscosity data of the three solutions for which temperature fluctuation had been problematic. The trivalent cation study involved addition of Al 3 + or Cr 3 + cation to solutions of CMC. The overall objective was to produce high viscosity CMC solutions by promoting crosslinking through the trivalent cations to anionic sites along the polymer chains. Addition of A 1 C 13 solution to the CMC solution was ineffective: at low ionic strengths, polymer precipitated out of solution. To prevent precipitation {{it was necessary to}} deliver the trivalent cation more slowly. This was accomplished by adding trivalent cation either in combination with a chelating agent or already {{in the form of a}} metal complex. The chelating agents citric acid, malic acid, and EDTA, in combination with Al 3 + cation, were ineffective in yielding CMC solutions of high viscosity. Oxalic acid in combination with both Al 3 + and Cr 3 + cation as well as basic aluminum <b>acetate</b> and <b>chromium</b> (III) <b>acetate</b> hydroxide did produce high viscosity CMC solutions. In terms of ligands, acetate was even more effective than oxalate. In terms of cations, Cr 3 + was even more effective than Al 3 +...|$|R
40|$|Synthetic Birnessite, an {{octahedral}} layered {{manganese oxide}} material called OL- 1 was synthesized with Na+, K+, Na +/Mg 2 +, K+/Mg 2 +, Na +/K+ ions as interlayer cations by redox reactions between permanganate and alcohols {{in a strong}} basic media. Chromia pillared OL- 1 s were prepared under reflux conditions using trinuclear <b>chromium</b> hydroxyl <b>acetate</b> as a pillaring agent followed by calcination in a N 2 atmosphere at 200 °C. Vanadium oxide pillared OL- 1 s were obtained by intercalating neutral vanadyl acetylacetonate (VOacac) or vanadium acetylacetonate (Vacac) into the interlayer of OL- 1 and subsequently calcining in air at 300 °C. The synthesis procedures were monitored using X-ray diffraction studies. The resultant materials were characterized by XRD, X-ray absorption, X-ray photoelectron spectra, FTIR, UV-VIS, inductively coupled plasma, transmission electron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray analysis, potentiometric titration, thermal analyses, TPD measurements, BET surface area and pore size distribution measurements. OL- 1 materials prepared using this alcohol route showed enhanced thermal stabilities and increased Mg accommodation compared to OL- 1 s prepared with other methods. Based on the analysis methods developed here, Na-OL- 1 exhibited recoverable and reversible structural and surface O 2 oxygen species while K-OL- 1 showed higher stability. Na-OL- 1 had predominantly Brønsted acid sites resulting from OH groups bonded to Mn on Na-OL- 1 surfaces, while the Na/Mg-OL- 1 had mainly Lewis acid sites. Large porosity was obtained in chromia pillared OL- 1 materials with a narrow pore size distribution centered around 18 Å. Although these materials remained “amorphous” as determined by XRD after calcination, TEM morphology {{studies suggest that the}} materials were still layered. EXAFS studies indicated the formation of Cr-O-Mn bonds in the resultant materials via comer-shared linkages of CrO 6 and MnO 6 octahedra. Good crystallinity in VOacac intercalated OL- 1 was achieved, which after calcination, {{led to the formation of}} mesoporous VOx pillared OL- 1 materials with the pore diameters being in the range of 36 to 41 Å. The intercalation of bulky neutral inorganic species into the interlayer of OL- 1 through an exfoliation route simplified the pillaring process and preparative factors and made the process and pore sizes in the pillared materials controllable. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{aluminia}} and titania promoted, silica- supported <b>chromium</b> (III) <b>acetate</b> catalysts were characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) prior to, and after, activation in oxygen at 780 C. The {{results indicated that}} Cr (VI) was formed in each case {{as a result of}} the activation process. Increased promoter metal binding energies implied an interaction between the promoter and silica support. It is proposed that there is insertion of aluminium and titanium atoms into the silica network, which leads to formation of surface silicates. A qualitative measure of the metal dispersions has been made using the XPS results. In general, the chromium dispersion fell on activation, but the greatest decline was seen with the lowest chromium loading (0. 5 % Cr), Promoter metal dispersion was unchanged on activation, except in the case of the highest titanium loading (4. 35 % Ti), where small titania clusters are formed. Mass spectral analysis of the gases evolved during thermal decomposition in argon led to a mechanism being proposed for the decomposition of the acetate precursor. The first step is dehydration of the silica support, which is followed by decompositon of acetate ligands to form an intermediate, which was thought to be a carbonate, and the final stage is the decomposition of this intermediate to chromium (III) oxide for the unpromoted catalysts. Where a promoter is present a structural and electronic interaction between the chromium complex and the promoter is proposed, which leads to formation of mixed surface oxides of perovskite (M(^II) Ti(^IV) 0 (_ 3)) or spinel (M(^II) Al(_ 2) (^III) 0 (_ 4)) structure, where M = Cr. For activation under oxygen the pattern of decomposition was much simpler. Studies of the promoted catalysts showed the oxidation to occur—in two stages. It was not clear which chromium species were present after the first step, but the second step led to the formation of chromium (VI) oxide for all catalysts. Modelling of the adsorption sites on metal surfaces has also been undertaken with a series of triosmium carbonyl complexes containing ligands derived from aniline, phenol, pyrrole, furan, thiophene and benzene. These complexes have been characterized using Fourier Transform Infra Red spectroscopy and their vibrational spectra assigned in full. The usefulness of these complexes as models, and in the assignment of vibrational spectra of adsorbates on metal surfaces, is discussed...|$|R

Realizaram-se estudos sobre a reprodutibilidade do filme de bismuto e o tempo de contacto entre crómio e DTPA, agente complexante usado. Calibrou-se o eléctrodo para duas gamas de concentração de ordem nanomolar de Cr(VI) e estimaram-se os limites de detecção (LOD) e de quantificação (LOQ).

This study focused on the detection and speciation of trace <b>chromium</b> in <b>acetate</b> medium, pH 6. 0, by square wave adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry (SWAdCSV) at a rotating-disc bismuth film electrode (BFE) deposited ex situ onto a glassy carbon electrode. DTPA {{was used as the}} complexing agent and nitrate ions as a catalytic agent. The speciation of chromium is of particular interest because the two main forms usually present in the environment, Cr(VI) e Cr(III), have different toxicities. It can also determine its ecological impact and its environmental mobility and transport behaviour. After choosing the best conditions for the deposition of the bismuth film onto the glassy carbon substrate, we proceeded to the optimization of various experimental parameters that could affect the stripping performance of Cr(III) and Cr(VI). The influence of DTPA concentration, potassium nitrate concentration, accumulation potential, accumulation time, electrode rotation speed and equilibrium time was studied. Also the effect of the square wave parameters - amplitude, frequency and potential step – on the voltammetric signal of C(III) and (VI) was investigated. Studies for the reproducibility of the bismuth film electrode and the contact time between the complexing agent and chromium were made. Under the selected optimized conditions, two linear calibration plots were obtained in the nanomolar concentration range; the resulting detection limit (LOD) and quantification limit (LOQ) were 0, 336 and 1, 12 nmol L- 1, for the range of 1 to 9 nmol L- 1, 0, 312 and 1, 00 nmol L- 1, for the range of 10 to 90 nmol L- 1, respectively. The effect of a typical non-ionic surfactant, Triton X- 100, and several metal ions, that could potentially interfere with the chromium determination, was considered. Finally, the proposed methodology was successfully applied to the determination of Cr(VI), Cr(III) and Crtotal in real samples. Water samples that were collected from river Tagus in Algés and a compost produced from the organic fraction of solid urban waste were analysed. The bismuth film electrode appears to be a promising tool for electroanalytical purposes in comparison to commonly used mercury electrodes, ensuring the use of a clean methodology for the monitorization of chemical species in environmental matrices...|$|R
