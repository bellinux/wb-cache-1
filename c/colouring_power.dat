6000|$|P. 449, l. 34 onward. Mrs. Wordsworth. My {{excellent}} Correspondent the Rev. R.P. Graves, of Dublin, thus writes me of Mrs. Wordsworth: 'I forget {{whether it}} {{has been put on}} record, as it certainly deserves to be, that Wordsworth habitually referred to his wife for the help of her judgment on his poems. Mrs. Wordsworth did not indeed possess the creative and <b>colouring</b> <b>power</b> of imagination that belonged to his sister as well as to himself; but her simple truthfulness, her strong good sense (which no sophistry could impose upon), and her delicate feeling for propriety, rendered her judgment a test of utmost value with regard to any subjects of which it could take adequate cognisance. And these were confined within no narrow range--the workings of Nature as it lived and moved around her, social equities and charities, religious and moral truth, tried by the heart {{as well as by the}} head, and verbal expression, required by her to avoid the regions of the merely abstract and philosophical, and keep to the lower but more poetical ground of idiomatic strength and transparent logic.' ...|$|E

40|$|The use {{of natural}} food colours is {{preferred}} to that of arti­ficial dyestuffs for modern alimentary purposes. Paprika is a spice plant grown and consumed in considerable quantities worldwide and also used as a natural food colour, so the <b>colouring</b> <b>power</b> of powders is very important. The colour of paprika powder is highly relevant too because the consumer concludes its <b>colouring</b> <b>power</b> based on its colour. The <b>colouring</b> <b>power</b> of paprika powders is directly determined by {{the quality and quantity}} of the colouring agent of paprika. The paprika oleoresin, that is an oil soluble extract from the fruits of Capsicum Annum Linn or Capsicum Frutescens, is suitable to raise the colour agent content of paprika powders. We investigated how the colour and the characteristics of paprika powder samples with added oleoresin change in the course of storage. The colour agent content of 7 different quality powders was increased with 7 - 75 % using oleoresin. The initial colour agent content of samples changed between 41 and 169 ASTA units. The powders were made from Chinese, Peruvian, and Hungarian paprika. Colour measurements were performed with a HunterLab MiniScan colour-measuring instrument. The CIELab colour system was used for colour characterization. The colour agent content and the colour coordinates of samples were measured throughout 9 months. The decrease of colour agent con­tent varied between 22 and 51 percent, while the average reduction was 33 percent. The quantity of added oleoresin did not influence the colour agent content decrease significantly...|$|E
40|$|Sea fennel (Crithmum maritimum L.) is a {{perennial}} halophyte species typical of coastal ecosystems, used fresh in traditional cuisine and folk medicine {{due to its}} sensory properties and a good content of healthy compounds. Although considered as a promising biosaline crop, this halophyte is underutilized for commercial cultivation possibly due to a shortage of its consumer demand. For promoting a full exploitation of this species, a new food product was obtained by drying sea fennel using different treatments (air-drying, microwave-drying, microwave-assisted air-drying and freeze-drying). Water activity, essential oil content, chlorophylls, surface colour, <b>colouring</b> <b>power</b> and sensory evaluation were analyzed. All drying treatments allow to obtain a good water activity but significantly reduced the content of essential oils and chlorophylls. Freeze-drying and microwaving preserved the surface colour parameters more than other drying treatments, while freeze-drying gave the product the best <b>colouring</b> <b>power.</b> Based on sensory analysis, microwave-drying, microwave-assisted air-drying and freeze-drying showed the highest scores among the drying methods. Taken together {{the results indicate that}} microwaving and freeze-drying are optimal for preserving qualitative traits, including organoleptic properties, in dried sea fennel for food use. Furthermore, dried sea fennel can be usefully exploited in human food not only for its aromatic traits but also for its food <b>colouring</b> <b>power</b> like other plant derived natural colorants. It could be concluded that this underutilized crop could play a better role for making up a sustainable food production system...|$|E
40|$|Iron zircon coral {{pigments}} {{are very}} interesting from an industrial {{point of view}} because of their high <b>colouring</b> <b>power</b> and their stability at high temperatures. However, the pigment's synthesis is particularly troublesome due to its specific reaction mechanism. As an encapsulated pigment it becomes very important how the raw materials are distributed in the reaction mixture. To {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} the mixing process, it would be convenient to define a parameter, that is the mixing index, to estimate the degree of homogeneity of the system. In the current investigation, a mixing index is proposed derived from the power spectrum of Fourier transform of scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the raw material mixture. Concretely, the number of pixels in a certain range of values {{in the image of the}} power spectrum, seems to behave relatively well as mixing index. This index allows us to distinguish between samples with different zirconia and iron oxide used as precursors. The proposed mixing index seems to be related to the <b>colouring</b> <b>power</b> of the final pigment when the synthesis generates enough zircon to encapsulate hematite particles...|$|E

The synthesised OMt combining both surfactants, MB and EHDDMA, present higher interlayer distances than those with only MB, which were employed in previous works as nanopigments. When these OMt were incorporated in the EVA matrix, the obtained clay polymer nanocomposites (CPN) showed a high exfoliation degree of the OMt in the polymer, {{in such a way that}} at 80 % of the cationic exchange capacity (CEC) of the Mt exchanged with EHDDMA, most of the OMt was exfoliated. Moreover, all the obtained CPN showed an increase in the Young's Moduli compared to the EVA reference, and especially those containing higher amounts of MB. The thermal stability of the CPN also increases with the MB content, compared to other CPN including conventional surfactants. The hiding power and <b>colouring</b> <b>power</b> achieved in the CPN are higher even with a much lower load of MB when EHDDMA is exchanged in the Mt.

30|$|Azurite (2 CuCO 3 ·Cu(OH) 2) was {{the most}} {{diffused}} blue pigment during Middle Ages, and before [1, 20]. It appears to be stable to light and atmosphere, and shows good performances both in oil and tempera mediums [111, 112], although its poor hiding power in oil is reported in literature [113]. Degradation of azurite in frescoes seems related to pH and grain size [91, 114]. Azurite degrades to green compounds: malachite (CuCO 3 ·Cu(OH) 2) and paratacamite/atacamite (Cu 2 Cl(OH) 3) are some examples [28, 64, 111, 112, 115 – 118]. Humidity and chloride ions from various sources cause the formation of black copper oxides (CuO) and green chlorides (nantokite CuCl, paratacamite/atacamite or botallackite Cu 2 Cl(OH) 3 [103, 116, 118 – 121]). Azurite degrades to black tenorite CuO when exposed to heat in presence of alkali [20, 68, 91, 103, 113, 114, 121 – 123], while cold alkaline conditions might not affect it [111], or cause conversion to malachite [119], or the formation of tenorite via formation of copper hydroxide Cu(OH) 2 [35, 64, 114]. On the other hand, it is decomposed by acids, such as oxalic acid to form oxalates (CuC 2 O 4 ·nH 2 O, mooloite) [32, 55, 116]. It {{has been reported that}} the combination of oxalic acid and chlorides in wall paintings results in Cu-hydroxychlorides Cu 2 Cl(OH) 3 and Ca-oxalates [59]; and that no Cu-oxalates were observed in azurite paint layers [58]. On the other hand, oxalates attributable to the biodegradation of an organic binder were found in both a gypsum preparation (weddellite/whewellite) and in the overlying azurite-containing paint layer [116]. Cu-carboxylates are rarely formed, as leadwhite, often mixed with azurite, is more reactive; moreover, as azurite is preferred in a tempera medium, carboxylic acids are less present [56]. In proteinaceous binder, other interactions are reported [51]. Verdigris xCu(CH 3 COO 2)·yCu(OH) 2 ·zH 2 O might be formed when high relative humidity interacts with an azurite containing paint layer, degrading the oil binder [64]. Also, the yellowing of the binder/varnish can alter the blue shade to a green one in oil paintings [111]. Small particles are reported to have less <b>colouring</b> <b>power</b> and to be more sensitive to chemical interaction [35], and to dissolve in organic binding media [111]. In egg tempera, azurite is not affected by light, while thermal ageing, high relative humidity, and pollutants affect the paint film (oxidative processes) [112]. Also, the copper interacts with the proteinaceous moieties to form metalloproteins [112]. Azurite turns bluish-black when exposed to H 2 S vapours [124], especially in frescoes [111], as covellite CuS is formed. The effect of laser irradiation on azurite is the formation of black CuO, which depends on the particle size and therefore on the temperature increase [112, 114, 125]. Selective biological activity is observed towards lead pigments [124].|$|E
40|$|Abstract : Despite an {{increasing}} number of studies, colouring materials are still poorly understood among excavation remains. Their attraction lies in their capacity to bring to light diverse and complex skills, but also in their intense <b>colouring</b> <b>power</b> and their contrasting colours : red and black, which still possess a symbolic value. These highly symbolic materials may, therefore, highlight the “conceptual” practices of prehistoric men and give access to their symbolic world and thought. In such a particular context as the transition between the Middle and the Upper Palaeolithic, these remains, which are very abundant in most excavations, offer the possibility, through analysis, to get an exceptional insight into the way of life of the last Neanderthals. The Châtelperronian site of the “Grotte du Renne”, in Arcy-sur-Cure (Yonne), is a landmark. It was excavated beween 1949 and 1963 by André Leroi-Gourhan : Numerous colouring materials were discovered there, and Leroi-Gourhan developed theories about their transformation and uses which so far have not been tested, and have remained unchallenged. Since their discovery, the assumption is that those minerals were heated in a controlled way, in order to modify their colour. It is indeed well-known that heat transforms yellow materials (iron hydroxides) in orange, red or purple materials (iron oxides). From this hypothesis originates the theory according to which Neanderthals exploited colouring materials as pigments for symbolic or even aesthetic purposes. But the theory has so far never been proved true. Our study combines several sets of data, obtained from different methods. Physico-chemical and petrological analyses were carried out on the colouring materials. These data were related to their location on the site, in association with exceptionally well preserved “hut” structures. Furthermore, a series of experimentations, aimed to characterize powders obtained via different methods (grinding and crushing on the one hand, abrasion on the other hand). The comparison of all these data enabled us to identify the various technical choices which informed the supply in colouring minerals in all the Châtelperronian levels of the Grotte du Renne. It was thus possible to demonstrate that none of these materials, either red or black, was heated before being used, contrary to what had been assumed so far. The supply in colouring materials was as carefully organised as for other materials (ﬂint, for example); they were collected in geological formations occasionally showing on the surface, at more than 10 km from the cave. The exploitation of these geological sites did not vary during the whole Châtelperronian period, and privileged materials which can easily be ground into powder. Part of their supply was ground coarsely in order to cover large surface areas (soils or hides) as preservative or to clean them up. The remaining materials were destined to more meticulous activities, which required a ﬁne, regular, and highly-colouring powder. In this latter case, the Neanderthals of the Grotte du Renne used those products when working on bone materials (bone or mammoth ivory), and used them also for their sheer colour. The set of colouring minerals from the Grotte du Renne reveals Neanderthals’ in-depth knowledge of materials; they understood perfectly well their properties and qualities, and used them extensively, so that the Châtelperronian site must have been a literally dazzling sight, all red and black. The “chaîne opératoire” which transpires from our analysis shows very sophisticated techniques, and an advanced “technological” knowledge. They are witness to surprising capacities and a highly-evolved pattern of thought...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, I {{explore the}} ways in which ethnically and {{culturally}} diverse women work together to rbedige their differences. Using a critical, feminist, reflexive and post-colonialist approach, I conducted eight in-person, semi-structured interviews with women who were staff and board members, volunteers, or participants in programmes offered by an organization serving immigrant women. Wommen were asked to name their cultural or ethnic identities, to share their views on multiculturalism, tolerance, and the “welcoming” of newcomers to Canada, the uniting and divisive issues they faced in their work, as well as appropriate roles for Canadian-born and immigrant women in the organization at which they work. According to my interviews with women and the organizational data, one of the main features of women’s work together has been their attempt to “fit in. ” In the context of this particular organization, “fitting in” meant that women emphasized commonalities and swerved away from critical and political analyses, particularly around notions of <b>colour,</b> <b>power</b> and privilege. In addition, women within this organization adopted mainstream society’s “liberal’ view of multiculturalism, which celebrated women’s diversity, but did not make room for {{a deeper understanding of the}} differences between individuals from diverse cultural, ethnic, and racial groups. As such, ethnically and culturally diverse women tended to work together as “Canadians,” and swept aside their differences or challenges. Women’s responses to the questions regarding the “how” of their work together were impacted by their skin colour (visible minority vs. white) and experience with immigration (Canadian-born vs. immigrant to Canada). Colour was a salient predictor of women’s experiences, as visible minority women (regardless of their country of birth) were more forthcoming about their views on multiculturalism, tolerance, and the roles women should play within the organization. Generally, all participants were quite uncomfortable with critical language around <b>colour,</b> <b>power</b> and privilege, which was understandable given the organization’s downplaying of “political” issues, and our larger society’s avoidance of issues of power and privilege. To account for some of the “gaps” in communication between ethnically and culturally diverse women, I discuss the utility of an anti-oppressive framework and the abandonment of critical language (without a rejection of the underlying critical approach) in order to “build bridges” between diverse women working together in Canada...|$|R
