The group spent months raising funds for a down payment on the building, with the bulk of its money coming from small individual donations. About 60 fundraisers were held, and a large grant was provided by PepsiCo after the Theatre Collective ran a successful social networking campaign for the April 2010 Pepsi Refresh Project. The Cacchios transferred ownership of the property to the Theatre Collective on August19, 2010.

5|$|Far Rockaway is {{notably the}} oldest station {{currently}} in {{operation in the}} New York City Subway, having originally opened over 145 years ago, on July 29, 1869, as a Long Island Rail Road station. However, Gates Avenue on the BMT Jamaica Line in Brooklyn is the oldest station in the subway system to have been built as a rapid transit station, {{and has been in}} <b>continuous</b> <b>operation</b> for over 130 years. The Far Rockaway station was converted from Long Island Rail Road trackage to subway loading gauge and has only operated for 57 years in this capacity. Therefore, Far Rockaway is actually the fifteenth newest station in the subway system (behind Grand Street; Harlem–148th Street; 57th Street; the three Archer Avenue Line stations; the three IND 63rd Street Line stations; the new South Ferry station; 34th Street–Hudson Yards; and the three Second Avenue Subway stations).|$|E
5|$|For {{at least}} 3,000 years from antiquity {{until the late}} 20thcentury mining of tin and copper played a {{significant}} part in the economy of Cornwall. Cornwall, {{the northern part of}} Iberia and the Ore Mountains (the modern border between the Czech Republic and Germany) are the only places in Europe in which major tin deposits are found near the surface. As tin is an essential ingredient of bronze, Cornwall was of great economic significance in Bronze Age Europe despite its relative isolation. Mining by the Roman Empire led to the Iberian mines becoming depleted by the 3rd centuryAD, leaving Cornwall and neighbouring Devon the most significant sources of tin in Europe. While it appears from surviving evidence that after the decline of the Bronze Age civilisations copper production ceased in Cornwall, it seems that the tin mines were in <b>continuous</b> <b>operation</b> throughout the Roman period and the Middle Ages.|$|E

5|$|The {{area where}} Armenia lies is of {{interest}} to seismologists and geologists because of the relatively early stage of continental collision occurring there and because the earthquake's strong aftershock sequence and significant surface faulting presented scientists with an environment to study reverse faulting. Twelve days after the mainshock a French-Soviet team installed a temporary seismic network in the epicentral area to record aftershock activity (a separate expedition from the United States also visited the site). The initial portion of work included nearly a full week setting up the seismometers and optimizing their operation and, with that complete, two full weeks of <b>continuous</b> <b>operation</b> was then completed with twenty six seismometers covering an area over 1500 square kilometers. The final stage concluded with seven weeks (through the end of February 1989) of continued monitoring with a reduced capacity of twenty units.|$|E
5|$|On 6November 1981, the Governor-General, Sir Zelman Cowen, {{presented}} the Queen's Colour to No.1 AD. By September {{the following year}} the depot's strength was down to 235 staff, but it pioneered the support of various new technologies for the Air Force, in fields such as electroplating, fibre optics, and electronics. It was also responsible for developing and testing components for the F-111, Macchi MB-326 and McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet jets. From 1986, restructuring and outsourcing began to impact heavily upon the RAAF's technical services. In February 1990, No.1 AD came {{under the control of}} Logistics Command, formed when Support Command was split into logistical and training components. By then the depot's functions had largely been taken over by other units and private contractors, and it was disbanded on 2December 1994. No.1 AD was, at the time, the oldest RAAF unit in <b>continuous</b> <b>operation</b> and, according to the RAAF Historical Section, the oldest continuously operating maintenance depot of any air force.|$|E
5|$|The Sejm {{also created}} two notable institutions: the Permanent Council, a main {{governmental}} body in <b>continuous</b> <b>operation,</b> and the Commission of National Education. The Council was intended by the partitioners {{to be an}} institution easier to control than the unruly Sejms, and indeed it remained {{under the influence of}} the Russian Empire. It was nonetheless a significant improvement in the Commonwealth governance. The Council, with committees (ministries) on Foreign Affairs, Treasury, Defense, Justice and the Interior (Police), was able to interpret existing laws in the sphere of administration, and provided the Commonwealth with a continuous governing body that operated between the Sejms and was not affected by the liberum veto. The Permanent Council was led by the king, had 36 members elected, half from each chamber of the Sejm, and ruled by majority vote (the king decided in case of a tie). The previously powerful ministers were placed under the control of the new council and supervised by the five parallel departments of the Council. The Council, in addition to its administrative duties, would present to the king three candidates for each nomination to the Senate and other main offices.|$|E

5|$|The X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, {{formerly}} known as the Clinton Pile and X-10 Pile, was the world's second artificial nuclear reactor (after Enrico Fermi's Chicago Pile) and was the first reactor designed and built for <b>continuous</b> <b>operation.</b> Argonne National Laboratory's Experimental Breeder Reactor I, located at the Atomic Energy Commission's National Reactor Testing Station near Arco, Idaho, became the first nuclear reactor to create electricity on 20 December 1951. Initially, four 150-watt light bulbs were lit by the reactor, but improvements eventually enabled it to power the whole facility (later, the town of Arco became the first in the world to have all its electricity come from nuclear power generated by BORAX-III, another reactor designed and operated by Argonne National Laboratory). The world's first commercial scale nuclear power station, Obninsk in the Soviet Union, began generation with its reactor AM-1 on 27 June 1954. Other early nuclear power plants were Calder Hall in England, which began generation on 17 October 1956, and the Shippingport Atomic Power Station in Pennsylvania, which began on 26 May 1958. Nuclear power was used for the first time for propulsion by a submarine, the USS Nautilus, in 1954.|$|E
5|$|All {{available}} lorries and camels were organised in convoys moving {{north from}} the railhead along the Gaza to Junction Station road from Deir el Belah to El Mejdel {{and then on}} to Julis, where the 26 and 27 Depot Unit of Supply (DUS) set up advanced supply dumps to serve the Australian Mounted Division and the Anzac Mounted Division. From these dumps the Transport Sections of 5 Company (New Zealand Army Service Corps) and the 32nd, 33rd, and 34th Companies (Australian Army Service Corps) served the Anzac Mounted Division, and the 35th, 36th, and 37th Companies served the Australian Mounted Division. These companies of horse- and mule-drawn wagons could operate to serve their brigades during brigade operations and when required could form into divisional trains during divisional operations. A forward lorry-head was established at Ramleh, where the loads were dumped and the Transport Companies distributed the supplies to the forward units. Members of the Egyptian Labour Corps (as second drivers) worked alongside the Australian Army Service Corps transporting, loading, and unloading the General Service and Limber wagons of supplies ordered by the brigades. The huge endeavour was administered by the supply sections in a similar fashion to the divisional ammunition columns which also worked to supply ammunition to the fighting units in a similarly <b>continuous</b> <b>operation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although Poniatowski {{protested the}} First Partition of the Commonwealth (1772), he was {{powerless}} {{to do anything}} about it. He considered abdication, but decided against it. During the Partition Sejm of 1773–1775, in which Russia was represented by ambassador Otto von Stackelberg, with no help forthcoming from abroad and the armies of the partitioning powers occupying Warsaw to compel the Sejm by force of arms, no alternative was available save submission to their will. Eventually Poniatowski and the Sejm acceded to the partition treaty; at the same time, several other reforms were passed. The Cardinal Laws were confirmed and guaranteed by the partitioning powers. Royal power was restricted, as the king lost the power to give out titles, and positions of military officers, ministers and senators, the starostwo territories, and Crown lands would be awarded through an auction. The Sejm also created two notable institutions: the Permanent Council, a main governmental body in <b>continuous</b> <b>operation,</b> and the Commission of National Education. The partitioners intended the Council to be easier to control than the unruly Sejms, and indeed it remained {{under the influence of the}} Russian Empire. Nevertheless, it was a significant improvement in the Commonwealth governance.

5|$|Women {{typically}} {{began working}} at the mines at around the age of 10 or 11, {{although there are some}} cases of girls starting work at as young as six, and in areas such as Camborne with a high demand for workers it was not unusual for girls to start work at age seven or eight. (Charles Foster Barham's enquiry of 1841 found an average age for starting work of 12.) Until the 1870s Cornwall was largely unaffected by legislation which limited child labour in mines elsewhere in the United Kingdom, and the typical ages of bal maidens remained virtually unchanged between the 1841 census and the 1871 census. Women would typically remain at the mine until they married; while this generally meant that they stopped working at between the ages of 19 and 24, it was not unusual for unmarried women and widows to continue working into their 60s and 70s; and a 93-year-old bal maiden was recorded in the 1891 census. A typical working day would last from 7.00am to 5.00pm in summer and from dawn to dusk in winter, (ore dressing by candle-light was not cost effective) with a lunch break of either half an hour or an hour at noon. Lunch typically consisted of pasties, hoggans (hard pasties made with unleavened barley flour and filled with pork, potato or dried fruit) or fish eaten cold or warmed in ovens attached to the mine's furnaces, along with mugwort or pennyroyal tea, and it was not usual even for workers who lived near their workplace to go home for meals. Although still not paid on a piece-rate basis, each bal maiden would be expected to meet a daily quota to earn her pay; some mines operated on the basis that once the quota had been met the bal maidens were allowed to go home, meaning the working day could finish up to two hours early. Although at a few tin mines at which water-powered machinery was in <b>continuous</b> <b>operation</b> bal maidens would work seven days a week, {{in the vast majority of}} the industry they were not expected to work on Sundays. As well as the religious holidays observed in the rest of the United Kingdom, Cornish miners also celebrated St Piran's Day (5March) and Chewidden Thursday (the Thursday before Christmas), purportedly the day on which St Piran rediscovered tin-smelting. Other than religious holidays and parish feast days, Cornish miners had no holidays until labour reforms in the early 20thcentury.|$|E

This lower bound is proved to be sharp if arbitrary <b>continuous</b> <b>operations</b> are allowed. Then there exists even a balanced optimal computation tree forf. In the second part we use these results {{in order to determine the}} topological {{complexity of}} zero-finding for continuous functionsfon the unit interval withf(0) ·f(1) < 0. It is proved that roughly log 2 log 2 ϵ− 1 comparisons are optimal during a computation in order to approximate a zero up to ϵ. This is true regardless of whether one allows arbitrary <b>continuous</b> <b>operations</b> or just function evaluations, the arithmetic operations {+, −, *, /}, and the absolute value. It is true also for the subclass of nondecreasing functions. But for the subclass of increasing functions the topological complexity drops to zero even for the smaller class of operations...|$|R
