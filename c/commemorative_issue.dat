5|$|The first {{postage stamp}} to honor Hamilton was {{issued by the}} U.S. Post Office in 1870. The portrayals on the 1870 and 1888 issues are from the same {{engraved}} die, which was modeled after a bust of Hamilton by Italian sculptor Giuseppe Ceracchi. The Hamilton 1870 issue was the first U.S. postage stamp to honor a Secretary of the Treasury. The three-cent red <b>commemorative</b> <b>issue,</b> which was released on the 200th anniversary of Hamilton's birth in 1957, includes a rendition of the Federal Hall building, located in New York City. On March 19, 1956, the United States Postal Service issued the $5 Liberty Issue postage stamp honoring Hamilton.|$|E
5|$|The {{transfer}} of postage-stamp production {{from the states}} to the Commonwealth in 1913 has resulted in four issues being produced featuring a black swan design, three commemorating a Western Australian anniversary. In 1929, a stamp designed by Perth architect George Pitt Morrison, featuring a black swan taken {{from one of the}} colonial stamp designs, marked the state's centenary. In 1954, the centenary of the first Western Australian stamp was marked by a <b>commemorative</b> <b>issue</b> in a similar style to the original one-penny Black Swan. In 1979, the state's 150th anniversary was marked with an issue featuring the anniversary logo, a stylised black swan. A 1991 series of waterbirds included a 43-cent stamp showing a pair of black swans nesting with cygnets. This is the only philatelic recognition of the black swan's cultural values in eastern Australia as an emblem of estuarine and riverine environments characteristic of south-eastern Australia.|$|E

25|$|Nicklaus was {{inducted}} into the World Golf Hall of Fame in the inaugural class of 1974 and the Canadian Golf Hall of Fame in 1995. His likeness was featured on a special <b>commemorative</b> <b>issue</b> five-pound note issued by the Royal Bank of Scotland, making him the first living person outside the Royal Family to appear on a British banknote. In 1999 he was on the six man short list for the BBC's Sports Personality of the Century.|$|E
25|$|On October 14, 1969, the Post Office {{issued a}} 6-cent {{commemorative}} stamp honoring President Dwight D. Eisenhower, introduced at Abilene, Kansas, {{the city where}} he spent his youth and was eventually buried. Uncommonly larger than the standard commemorative sizes of 1½″ × 1″, this issue's size was 2″ × 1¼. The Eisenhower <b>commemorative</b> <b>issue</b> was designed by Robert J. Jones of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing and was fashioned after a photograph taken by Bernie Noble of the Cleveland Press.|$|E

25|$|McKinley first {{appeared}} on U.S. postage in a <b>commemorative</b> <b>issue,</b> the Louisiana Purchase series of 1904. McKinley is depicted on the Louisiana Purchase issue as he was the president who signed the legislation giving federal sanction to the Exposition and would have presided over the Exposition had he lived. This issue {{also served as a}} tribute and memorial to the assassinated leader, as it came out less than three years after his death, in what would have been nearing {{the end of the second}} term to which he was elected in 1900.|$|E
25|$|Osborne {{was awarded}} an honorary {{professorship}} at Kiev University in the Ukraine {{in recognition of}} her research on the Chernobyl disaster, {{as well as an}} honorary research fellowship from Somerville College, Oxford. She received honorary doctorates from the UK's Open University and from the University of Natal, South Africa. She was awarded the Sircar Memorial Gold Medal for Research in Physiology of the University of Calcutta in 1983. She was elected a corresponding member of the Botanical Society of America in 1996. In January 2008, a <b>commemorative</b> <b>issue</b> of the journal Annals of Botany was published in her honour.|$|E
25|$|She {{set up a}} {{press in}} her house and started to publish a {{literary}} monthly magazine Chinta in 1986. Later it was renamed Dwitiyo Chinta in 1988. Soon Iffat Mansion, her residence in Mymensingh town since 1960, from where she published her magazine, became a hub of literary activities. The poet Jibanananda Das birth centenary edition of the Dwitiyo Chinta, brought out in 1999, remains an example of high quality editing and planning of a <b>commemorative</b> <b>issue</b> of a magazine. Dwitiyo Chinta has published writings of many eminent writers and poets {{of the country in}} addition to regional writers.|$|E

25|$|Köhler's {{groundbreaking}} work on microscope illumination {{was published}} in the Zeitschrift für wissenschaftliche Mikroskopie in 1893 in Germany, followed by an English summary of his work in the Journal of the Royal Microscopical Society one year later. Its significance was not noted until several years later when Köhler was invited to join the Carl Zeiss AG company based on his invention. A century after its first publication, a translation of Köhler's original article, A New System of Illumination for Photomicrographic Purposes, was reprinted in the Köhler Illumination Centenary <b>commemorative</b> <b>issue</b> by the Royal Microscopical Society in 1994. Today, the Köhler illumination {{is considered one of the}} most important principles in achieving the best optical resolution on a light microscope.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the end of}} World War I, the Post Office, as a rule, issued {{commemorative}} stamps {{for only}} one reason: to promote a significant national exposition mounted by a U.S. city (the solitary exception to this practice was the Lincoln Memorial issue of 1909). The limited range of stamp subjects suitable to these trade fairs left no room for Washington's image on such commemoratives -- {{even though he was}} the central subject of U.S. definitive stamps during these years. It was only after this restriction had been abandoned, in 1925, that Washington first appeared on a <b>commemorative</b> <b>issue.</b> This was twenty-one years after the Louisiana Purchase Exposition series, which had included the first three American commemoratives to honor specific presidents: Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe and William McKinley.|$|E
25|$|The 2-cent Lincoln {{stamp of}} 1909 -- the first U.S. single stamp <b>commemorative</b> <b>issue</b> -- {{had the same}} {{dimensions}} as a definitive stamp. This is not surprising, for it was, in effect, cloned from the 2-cent Washington definitive issue of the previous year. Using a photostat of that stamp as a template, the designer Claire Aubrey Huston inserted an image of Lincoln into the wreath-surrounded oval occupied by Washington, and then superimposed the date ribbons in wash, turning the composite over to the engravers. Lincoln had appeared {{on at least one}} denomination of every regular issue since 1866. When the definitive issues of 1908 featured only the portraits of Washington and Franklin, there was considerable public disappointment at Lincoln's exclusion. The 100th anniversary issue of his birth created an opportunity to mollify the situation. The engraving of Lincoln on this issue by Marcus Baldwin is modeled after a statue by sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens.|$|E

500|$|Special {{editions of}} {{magazines}} and products featured the team. Dave Campbell's Texas Football {{put out a}} 45,000-copy special issue titled One for the Ages – Vince Young Leads Longhorns to the Fourth National Title. This issue included a column from Longhorn fan Matthew McConaughey as well as 15pages of photos from the Rose Bowl. The cover featured Young kissing the [...] "crystal football" [...] national championship trophy. Sports Illustrated held up their regular weekly edition to await {{the results of the}} Rose Bowl. They finally went to press with a cover showing Young diving into the end zone with the label [...] "Superman". Analysis inside the issue gave Young {{a large part of the}} credit for the win. They also printed a special <b>commemorative</b> <b>issue</b> in the state of Texas with Young on the cover, shouting in triumph amidst a storm of multi-colored confetti after winning the game. Features in the special edition included a story on Vince Young's Glory Days by Tim Layden, as well as a story dissecting How the Rose Bowl was won by Austin Murphy. The issue was on sale alongside the regular edition of the magazine. General Mills produced a <b>commemorative</b> <b>issue</b> Wheaties box featuring Mack Brown and a Texas Longhorns football helmet on the front. The commemorative packaging was sold nationwide. Texas is the first national college football champion to be featured since Nebraska was on the box in 1997.|$|E
500|$|Once Kahn's {{bill was}} {{introduced}} in the House, Mint Director George E. Roberts began to make informal arrangements to prepare for the <b>commemorative</b> <b>issue.</b> The bill called for four different designs (the two $50 pieces would differ mainly in shape), plus a commemorative medal to be sold to fairgoers, with an award medal to be given to prizewinning exhibitors. All of these pieces were to be struck by the Bureau of the Mint, and Roberts asked the Commission of Fine Arts to recommend artists. Among those recommended were Adolph A. Weinman (who would design the Mercury dime and Walking Liberty half dollar in 1916), and Bela L. Pratt (creator of the 1908 Indian Head gold pieces). [...] Others included sculptors Evelyn Longman, Robert I. Aitken, Charles Keck, and Paul Manship.|$|E

25|$|The first U.S. {{postage stamp}} to honor Monroe was the Louisiana Purchase Expedition <b>commemorative</b> 3¢ <b>issue</b> of 1904. Monroe's image was {{engraved}} by George F.C. Simille, modeled after {{a painting by}} John Vanderlyn which now hangs in City Hall, New York City. The five stamps of this set -— three of which presented the first presidential images ever to appear on U.S. <b>commemorative</b> <b>issues</b> -— were sold only during the seven months of the Exposition.|$|R

500|$|Writing in Rolling Stones Harrison <b>commemorative</b> <b>issue,</b> in January 2002, Mikal Gilmore {{recognised}} his {{incorporation of}} dissonance on [...] "I Want to Tell You" [...] {{as having been}} [...] "revolutionary in popular music" [...] in 1966. Gilmore considered this innovation to be [...] "perhaps more originally creative" [...] than the avant-garde styling that Lennon and McCartney took from Karlheinz Stockhausen, Luciano Berio, Edgar Varese and Igor Stravinsky and incorporated into the Beatles' work over the same period. According to musicologist Dominic Pedler, the E79 chord that Harrison introduced in the song became [...] "one of the most legendary in the entire Beatles catalogue". Speaking in 2001, Harrison said: [...] "I'm really proud of that as I literally invented that chord … John later borrowed it on I Want You (She's So Heavy): [...] 'It's driving me mad.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Newsstands were swarmed {{by people}} looking for items {{concerning}} Selena. A line for the April 1, 1995 edition of the Corpus Christi Caller Times formed; the company added 11,000 copies to their print run and later printed 20,000 more copies to meet continued demand for the paper. A People magazine issue was released several days after her murder. Its publishers believed interest would soon wane; they released a <b>commemorative</b> <b>issue</b> within a week when {{it became apparent that}} interest was growing. The issue sold nearly a million copies, selling the entire first and second run within two weeks. It became a collector's item—a first in the history of People. Betty Cortina, editor of People, told Biography, [...] "it was unheard of" [...] for an issue to completely sell out. In the following months, the success of the Selena issue led the company to release People en Español aimed at the Latino market. This was followed by Newsweek en Español and Latina magazine.|$|E
500|$|Retrospective {{commentary}} on the album has been highly positive. In November 2010, Kerrang! published a tenth-anniversary <b>commemorative</b> <b>issue</b> dedicated to Holy Wood titled Screaming For Vengeance, calling it [...] "Manson's finest hour". In 2014, Metal Hammer identified the album as a modern classic, calling it the band's [...] "creative zenith". Manson said in a June 2015 Reddit AMA that he considered the record to be his best work, and, that same month, NME {{referred to it as}} the band's best album. A 2016 feature in Houston Press called Holy Wood [...] "the album that really cemented the band as more than just shock-rockers, but true musical mavericks with an intelligent perspective on social issues." [...] Metal Hammer referred to the record as [...] "perfect", saying: [...] "Manson has yet to better Holy Wood and that's fine—nobody's really bettered it. The flow of the record, the delivery of its concept, the clarity with which it strikes its opponents. A gargantuan artistic feat that will {{go down in history as}} Manson's defining statement." ...|$|E
