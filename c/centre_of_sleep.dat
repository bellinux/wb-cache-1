40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{effectiveness}} of {{cognitive behavioural therapy}} for insomnia (cbt-i) has been demonstrated in randomised controlled trials (rct's) with primary insomnia patients and, more recently, with comorbid insomnia patients. The clinical impact of the treatment is mainly on sleep quality {{and the use of}} medication {{and to a lesser extent}} on daytime functioning. So far there have been very few studies of the {{effectiveness of}} cbt-i in clinical settings. AIM: To examine the effectiveness of cbt-i for primary insomnia via an uncontrolled prospective study in a clinical tertiary care setting. METHOD: We included 76 patients with primary insomnia, most of whom having been referred by their gp or medical specialist to the Leuven University <b>Centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sleep,</b> who followed a 6 -week course of cbt-i as a group. Effects of cbt-i on primary and secondary outcome measures were studied. results cbt-i resulted in a significant improvement in all primary sleep variables such as sleep onset, sleep efficiency and sleep quality. The increase in total sleep time was less substantial, probably as a result of the specific sleep restriction guidelines. There was also a significant improvement on several secondary parameters, in particular dysfunctional cognitions, affective state, general health and use of medication. CONCLUSIONS: cbt-i has a significant impact on sleep quality, medication use and daytime functioning in primary insomniacs in a clinical tertiary care setting. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Daytime {{sleepiness}} is {{a complaint}} of about 5 - 10 % {{in a normal}} population. The consequences, such as impaired performance and accidents at the workplace and while driving, have major impact on the affected and on society. According to Swiss federal statistics only 1 - 3 % of all motor vehicle accidents are due to excessive daytime sleepiness, which is in great contrast to a figure of 10 to 20 % of all accidents derived from scientific studies. Due to the inadequate statistical representation of the problem, insufficient countermeasures have been realized, {{and the state of}} drivers breaching traffic regulations is not adequately investigated in this respect. The most prevalent cause of microsleep induced accidents is certainly lack of sleep due to social or professional reasons. A treating physician must also consider sedating drugs and various diseases. The typical characteristics of accidents due to falling asleep at the wheel and the risk factors involved are well established, so that informing the general public, taking prophylactic countermeasures and a targeted investigation in this respect of drivers who have breached the law are all feasible. Since symptoms of sleepiness can be recognized well before any impairment of performance occurs, the most important countermeasure is information of the drivers on the risk factors and on efficient countermeasures against sleepiness at the wheel. Besides correct diagnosis and treatment, the primary goal of physicians treating patients with pathological daytime sleepiness is to inform them at an early stage about the risks of sleepiness and the large responsibility they bear while driving. This information should be written down in the patients' records. Professional drivers suffering from daytime sleepiness, drivers who have already had an accident due to microsleep and unreasonable drivers should be referred to a <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> disorders for objective measurements of sleepiness...|$|E

PURPOSE: The primary {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the effects <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> upon different areas of exercise performance. METHODS: Participants were 4 males and 1 female between the ages of 19 and 22.

RESULTS: The mean VO 2 max (ml/kg/min) for 2 hours <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> was 49. 5 (SD= 6. 5) and 48. 14 (SD= 6. 6) for 7 hours <b>of</b> <b>sleep.</b> The mean vertical jump (in) for 2 hours <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> was 17. 8 (SD= 3. 0) and 19. 9 (SD= 2. 7) for 7 hours <b>of</b> <b>sleep.</b> The mean number of pushups for 2 hours <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> was 23. 4 (SD= 13. 3) and 31. 6 (SD= 11. 0) for 7 hours <b>of</b> <b>sleep.</b> The mean number of curl-ups for 2 hours <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> was 38. 4 (SD= 15. 1) and 82. 4 (SD= 76. 3) for 7 hours <b>of</b> <b>sleep.</b> CONCLUSION: Based upon these results, sleep does not affect VO 2 max, vertical jump, pushups, or curl-ups.
