5|$|Proponents {{of the use}} of {{leverage}} argue that using leverage can be risk-reducing rather than risk-increasing provided four conditions are met: (i) enough unencumbered <b>cash</b> <b>is</b> kept to meet any margin calls (ii) leverage is applied to a well-diversified portfolio (iii) assets can be rebalanced frequently and (iv) counterparty risk is minimized.|$|E
5|$|The {{utility of}} money derives from {{circulation}} and loan-making. A village of ten households may have 100,000 coins. If the <b>cash</b> <b>is</b> {{stored in the}} household of one individual, even after a century, the sum remains 100,000. If the coins are circulated through business transactions so that every individual of the ten households can enjoy {{the utility of the}} 100,000 coins, then the utility will amount to that of 1,000,000 cash. If circulation continues without stop, the utility of the cash will be beyond enumeration.|$|E

25|$|Evidence {{shows that}} cash {{can be more}} transparent, more accountable, more cost effective, help support local markets and economies, and {{increase}} financial inclusion and give people more digity and choice. Sending <b>cash</b> <b>is</b> cheaper as {{it does not have}} the same transaction costs as shipping goods. Sending <b>cash</b> <b>is</b> also faster than shipping the goods. In 2009 for sub-Saharan Africa, food bought locally by the WFP cost 34 percent less and arrived 100 days faster than food sent from the United States, where buying food from the United States is required by law. Cash aid also helps local food producers, usually the poorest in their countries, while imported food may damage their livelihoods and risk continuing hunger in the future.|$|E

25|$|Structuring: Often {{known as}} smurfing, {{this is a}} method of {{placement}} whereby <b>cash</b> <b>is</b> broken into smaller deposits of money, used to defeat suspicion of money laundering and to avoid anti-money laundering reporting requirements. A sub-component {{of this is to}} use smaller amounts of cash to purchase bearer instruments, such as money orders, and then ultimately deposit those, again in small amounts.|$|E
25|$|A cash drawer {{is usually}} of strong {{construction}} {{and may be}} integral with the register or a separate piece that the register sits atop. It slides {{in and out of}} its lockable box and is secured by a spring-loaded catch. When a transaction that involves <b>cash</b> <b>is</b> completed, the register sends an electrical impulse to a solenoid to release the catch and open the drawer.|$|E
25|$|Most investors prefer {{their money}} to be in cash than in less fungible investments. <b>Cash</b> <b>is</b> on hand to be spent {{immediately}} if the need arises, but some investments require time or effort to transfer into spendable form. This is known as liquidity preference. A 1-year loan, for instance, is very liquid compared to a 10-year loan. A 10-year US Treasury bond, however, is liquid because it can easily be sold on the market.|$|E

25|$|A cash register's drawer {{can only}} be opened by an {{instruction}} from the cash register except when using special keys, generally held by the owner and some employees (e.g. manager). This reduces the amount of contact most employees have with cash and other valuables. It also reduces risks of an employee taking money from the drawer without a record and the owner's consent, such as when a customer does not expressly ask for a receipt but {{still has to be}} given change (<b>cash</b> <b>is</b> more easily checked against recorded sales than inventory).|$|E
25|$|Unlike an option, {{both parties}} of a futures {{contract}} must fulfill the contract on the delivery date. The seller delivers the underlying {{asset to the}} buyer, or, {{if it is a}} cash-settled futures contract, then <b>cash</b> <b>is</b> transferred from the futures trader who sustained a loss to the one who made a profit. To exit the commitment prior to the settlement date, the holder of a futures position can close out its contract obligations by taking the opposite position on another futures contract on the same asset and settlement date. The difference in futures prices is then a profit or loss.|$|E
25|$|It was {{announced}} on August 14, 2013, that bus-issued transfers (magnetic strip paper cards) {{would continue to}} be issued for cash fares paid on buses, but that these transfers would not work at SkyTrain or SeaBus station fare gates, which require the Compass Card. This means that a bus rider paying <b>cash</b> <b>is</b> required to pay a second fare to transfer to SkyTrain or SeaBus. Those transit users paying cash but beginning their trips at a SkyTrain or SeaBus station are not subject to this second fare because they are issued paper-based Compass Tickets which are accepted as valid transfers on TransLink buses.|$|E
