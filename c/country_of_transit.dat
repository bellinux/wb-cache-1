Some Lao men, women, and children migrate to neighboring countries in search of better economic opportunities but are subjected to conditions of forced or bonded labor or forced prostitution after arrival. Some Lao men who migrate willingly to Thailand are subjected to conditions of involuntary servitude in the Thai fishing and construction industry. To a lesser extent Laos is a <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> for Vietnamese, Chinese and Burmese women destined for Thailand. Laos’ potential as a transit country {{is on the rise}} with the construction of new highways linking the People’s Republic of China, Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia through Laos.

30|$|As far as {{migration}} and asylum are concerned in the EUGS (2016), the CSDP can be articulated with coastguard and border policing directed at ensuring the elimination of networks that traffic illegal migrants for profit. By assuming the current inadequacy of the EU {{migration and}} asylum policies, {{the need for a}} better understanding of migration-security nexus is evident. One of the priorities for external action relates to the state and social resilience to the South and East. Therefore, migration policy deserves a prominent role and requires special action in the <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> origin and <b>transit</b> <b>of</b> migrants and refugees. This action seems to favour mobility, legal migration, border management, readmission and return, by developing common actions between <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> origin and <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>transit,</b> aimed to respond and prevent the deep causes of displacements, manage migration dynamics in receiving countries more efficiently, and fight transnational criminality. Regular channels for legal and circular human mobility must be guaranteed to block irregular flows, and this demands a common, more efficient European asylum system that may ensure a safe, regulated and legal arrival of refugees searching for international protection in the EU. By recognizing the transnational nature of migration, the approach demands the need to incorporate other international partners to guarantee the sharing of responsibilities and solidarity on a global level, especially with Turkey, one <b>of</b> the main <b>transit</b> <b>countries</b> outside the EU (European Union, 2016).|$|R

When thousands of Jews tried to flee Austria after the Anschluss of March 1938, and again in 1942-1943 when Jews tried to escape deportation from France, the Netherlands, and Belgium, The Swiss borders were completely sealed to Jewish refugees. Till the Second World War was finished, 25,000 Jews were accepted in Switzerland as a refuge, and around 30,000 Jews were denied from entering the country.

This paper presents the results of a survey aim-ing to analyse in depth the reasons underlying the migration project as well as to identify any forms of integration in the host country, starting from immigrant re-ception centres. The journey to Italy, as well as the related costs and risks have been considered from the migrant’s point of view.

Migration with the purpose of study in Moldova is accompanied by a negative phenomenon, of the departure of highly qualified specialists. International migration of highly skilled labor, known as "brain drain"clearly evokes a loss of intellectual capital. Moldova continues to be characterized as an origin country of human beings trafficking, being at lesser extent a <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> of human trafficking victims from NIS countries to Europe.

This complex and controversial issue poses real concerns for Jordan, but has not yet been addressed effectively or efficiently either by Jordanian policy or in academic literature. Consequently, this study relies principally on the few legal texts pertaining to the topic, on the Ministry of Labor and on the Ministry of the Interior’s positions, and on information found in the Jordanian media. The study has four main sections: the first deals with Jordanian national law and the question of when a person is considered an irregular migrant; while the other three sections explore the way that the Jordanian public authorities deal with irregularity in practice. Finally, in the conclusion, we suggest ways in which the legal standing of irregular migrants in Jordan could be improved...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} major {{findings of}} a project focused on the experiences of Rohingya women in Malaysia, categorised as ‘irregular migrants’.

The fieldwork was conducted in late 2015, including 350 surveys and 35 in-depth interviews. The research findings reveal a range of factors that affect the lives of Rohingya women and their families before and during journeys, {{as well as in}} Malaysia. These factors affect planning for the future and decision for onward migration. The paper discusses the details of decision-making and information sharing during migration journeys and provides analysis of women’s choices and the factors that condition decision-making.

We could say this immigration is still at an embryonic stage, although it already shows the characteristics of a progressive sedentarisation. Within the facetted typologies of Tunisia-directed immigrants, the attention was focused on the University students coming from Central African countries, in order to pinpoint the dynamics of the (less studied than others) movements occurring along the South-to-South direction. The scantiness - if not absolute lack - of statistical data on this phenomenon led to the use of information obtained through an on-the-field survey...|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} illegal {{international}} trade in Indian Star Tortoises (Geochelone elegans), with a particular focus on India and Thailand. Within India, this species has received protection as a Schedule IV list species of the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972 for over 40 years. This study documents the illegal trade of 55, 000 individuals poached from just one 'trade hub' in India. Although domestic demand persists, these individuals {{appear to have been}} primarily sourced to satiate international demand for pets in other Asian countries (e. g. Thailand and China). Since 1975, this species has been included in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) that regulates all commercial trade. However, an analysis of the CITES trade records relating to Thailand imports (between 2004 and 2013) found large discrepancies indicating potential illegal activity which question the legitimacy of its founding captive stock. Given its role as a major hub of illegal trade activity, both as a consumer and a <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>transit,</b> we support calls for Thailand to prohibit private ownership by extending its domestic legislation to also cover non-indigenous tortoise species. In consideration of conservation and animal welfare concerns, we also call for more field research to determine the impacts of illegal trade on wild populations, an updated assessment of its conservation status, increased cooperation between national enforcement agencies, and the implementation of targeted human behaviour change initiatives to help reduce consumer demand for this species...|$|E

The government of Myanmar doesn’t recognized that the Rohingyas belong to the citizen of Myanmar. With this condition, the Rohingyas called as a stateless person. They have no citizenship status.
