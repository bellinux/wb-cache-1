40|$|In this talk, {{we discuss}} the {{compatibility}} of different deeply inelastic neutrino-nucleus data sets and the universal nuclear PDFs. This {{is an issue that}} has lately been investigated by different groups but the conclusions have been surprisingly contradictory. While some studies have found a good overall agreement between the nuclear PDFs and the neutrino data, others have <b>claimed</b> <b>for</b> an <b>incompatibility.</b> Here, we demonstrate that the independent neutrino data sets from NuTeV, CHORUS and CDHSW collaborations differ in the absolute overall normalization and that {{it is not possible to}} accurately reproduce all the data simultaneously with a single set of PDFs. Our strategy to overcome this difficulty and allow a consistent use of all neutrino data in global PDF analyses is to normalize the data by the integrated cross-sections thereby cancelling possible inaccuracies in the absolute normalization. Indeed, this brings all data to a surprisingly good mutual agreement underscoring the x-dependence of the nuclear modifications in a model-independent way. The consistency of these data with the present nuclear PDFs is verified by introducing a method to test the effect of a new data set in an existing global fit that performed a Hessian error analysis.

40|$|Abstract Background In utero {{interactions}} between incompatible maternal and fetal genotypes are a potential {{mechanism for the}} onset or progression of pregnancy related diseases such as pre-eclampsia (PE). However, the optimal analytical approach and study design for evaluating incompatible maternal/offspring genotype combinations is unclear. Methods Using simulation, we estimated the type I error and power of incompatible maternal/offspring genotype models for two analytical approaches: logistic regression used with case-control mother/offspring pairs and the log-linear regression used with case-parent triads. We evaluated a real dataset consisting of maternal/offspring pairs with and without PE <b>for</b> <b>incompatibility</b> effects using the optimal analysis {{based on the results}} of the simulation study. Results We identified a single coding scheme <b>for</b> the <b>incompatibility</b> effect that was equally or more powerful than all of the alternative analysis models evaluated, regardless of the true underlying model <b>for</b> the <b>incompatibility</b> effect. In addition, the log-linear regression was more powerful than the logistic regression when the heritability was low, and more robust to adjustment for maternal or fetal effects. For the PE data, this analysis revealed three genes, lymphotoxin alpha (LTA), von Willebrand factor (VWF), and alpha 2 chain of type IV collagen (COL 4 A 2) with possible incompatibility effects. Conclusion The incompatibility model should be evaluated for complications of pregnancy, such as PE, where the genotypes of two individuals may contribute to the presence of disease. </p...|$|R
