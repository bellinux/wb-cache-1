50|$|While {{working for}} 6 {{years as a}} member of the Finance & Economy Committee in the National Assembly, Song felt that the main driver of Korea’s economy came from the small {{companies}} which account for 80% of all companies and therefore that the most important thing is to lay down foundations for those firms to grow. In 2008, most small exporting firms bought <b>currency</b> <b>option</b> products called KIKO (Knock-in Knock-out) to avoid the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The companies were about to collapse again due to the inappropriate exchange rate policy of the current government but the government didn’t take the proper measures to rescue small companies. Song urged the Democratic Party to pay keen interest in this issue and to find solutions. By forming a special committee, he held dozens of meetings with small enterprises and led hearings to narrow differences and find solutions. In due course, he got a promise from the government to provide speedy support for small enterprises which performed well.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIt {{has been}} {{well-documented}} that foreign exchange rates exhibit both mean reversion and stochastic volatility. In addition to these, recent empirical evidence shows a stochastic skew of implied volatility surface from <b>currency</b> <b>option</b> data, {{which means that}} the slope of implied volatility curve of a given maturity is stochastically time varying. This paper develops a <b>currency</b> <b>option</b> pricing model which accommodates for this phenomena. The proposed model postulates that the log-currency value follows a mean reverting process with stochastic volatility driven by Wishart process under risk-neutral measure. Pricing formula for European <b>currency</b> <b>option</b> is derived in terms of Fourier Transform. Benchmarking against the Monte Carlo simulation, our numerical examples reveal that the pricing formula is accurate and remarkably efficient. The proposed model is also generalized to include jumps. The ability of the our model on capturing stochastic skew is illustrated through a numerical example...|$|E

40|$|This paper derives pricing {{equations}} for European puts {{and calls}} on formgn exchange. The call and put pricing formulas are unhke the Black-Scholes equations for stock options {{in that there}} are two relevant interest rates, interest rates are stochastic, and boundary constraints differ.

This paper develops pricing relationships for European and American call and put options on foreign currency. Foreign exchange (FX) options have features that distinguish them from options on common stock. Consequently, commonly used models for pricing stock options, such as the popular Black Scholes model, are inadequate for FX options.

40|$|The {{log-normal}} Garman and Kohlhagen (1983) <b>currency</b> <b>option</b> model usually creates pricing biases when {{matched with}} the market prices. The observed price bias pattern is generally consistent with the mixed jump-diffusion distribution for exchange rates. Various studies have provided evidence of jump risks in exchange rate movements. This paper argues that the jump risk in the exchange rates may be correlated {{with the market}}. Thus an equilibrium framework is needed to price the systematic jump components in <b>currency</b> <b>option</b> prices. I propose an equilibrium model to investigate {{the dynamics of the}} exchange rate in a small open monetary economy with stochastic jump-diffusion processes for both the money supply and aggregate dividend. It is shown that the exchange rate is affected by government monetary policies, aggregate dividends and the level of investment in foreign assets. As a result, the exchange rate exhibits more discontinuities than stock prices as empirically documented. Since the jump in the exchange rate is correlated with aggregate consumption, the jump risk in the exchange rate derived from aggregate dividend must be priced for currency options. I further derive the foreign agents' risk-neutral valuation of the European <b>currency</b> <b>option</b> and provide restrictions to ensure the parity conditions in <b>currency</b> <b>option</b> market. In general, these restrictions depend on the agent's risk preference. Exchange rates, Systematic jumps, Currency options, Open economy, Equilibrium...|$|E
