40|$|The use {{of waste}} fibers for the {{reinforcement}} of brittle matrices is considered opportune for the sustainable management of urban solid residues. This paper examines the microstructure and mechanical properties of a composite material made of gypsum reinforced with cellulose fibers from discarded Kraft <b>cement</b> <b>bag.</b> Two different kinds of gypsum were used, natural gypsum (NG) and recycled gypsum (RG), both with an addition of 10 % by mass of limestone. For the production of samples, slurry vacuum de-watering technique followed by pressing was evaluated revealing to be an efficient and innovative solution for the composites under evaluation. The composite was analyzed based on flexural strength tests, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging, secondary electron (SE) detection, and pseudo-adiabatic calorimetry. The morphology of the fractured surfaces of flexural test samples revealed large gypsum crystals double the original size surrounding the fibers, but with the same overall aspect ratio. Natural fibers absorb large amounts of water, causing the water/gypsum ratio of the paste to increase. The predominance of fiber pullout, damaged or removed secondary layers and incrusted crystals are indicative of the good bonding of the fiber to the gypsum matrix and of the high mechanical resistance of composites. This material is a technically better substitute for the brittle gypsum board, and it stands out particularly for its characteristics of high impact strength and high modulus of rupture...|$|E

40|$|No presente trabalho, considerou o estudo do potencial de utilização de sacos de cimento e embalagens de longa vida com o intuito de agregar valor a esses resíduos, mediante a fabricação de painéis de partículas para uso como forro em protótipos de galpões avícolas. Para fabricação desse {{material}} foi utilizado sacos de cimento descartados nas obras civis, embalagens longa vida residuais e resina poliuretana bicomponente à base de óleo de mamona. O estudo foi dividido em quatro etapas: 1) Caracterização da matéria-prima (sacos de cimento); 2) Efeito da densidade e teor de resina nas propriedades físicas, mecânicas e térmicas de painéis de partículas de saco de cimento; 3) Avaliação do desempenho de embalagens longa vida e verniz como revestimentos dos painéis selecionados na etapa anterior; 4) Determinação do desempenho térmico de protótipos de aviários executados em escala reduzida e distorcida com forro de painel de saco de cimento e embalagem longa vida. Os resultados obtidos indicaram: Em razão do painel com 0, 6 g. cm- 3 e 12 % de resina ter apresentado melhor desempenho nas propriedades investigadas, essa combinação foi selecionada para avaliar o desempenho do material (físicas, mecânicas e térmicas) quando revestido com embalagens longa vida, adotando a testemunha e o verniz como um revestimento comparativo. Dentre os revestimentos avaliados, os painéis com embalagens de longa vida, foram superiores aos revestidos com verniz, quando comparados as suas propriedades físicas, mecânicas e térmicas. Dessa maneira, painéis com 0, 6 g. cm- 3 e 12 % de resina revestidos embalagens longa vida, foram testados como forro quanto ao desempenho térmico (primavera, verão, outono e inverno) em protótipos em escala reduzida e distorcida, mediante a determinação de índices de conforto térmico (Entalpia e IAPfc) para aves de corte. A associação do forro sob o protótipo permitiu reduzir a temperatura interna do ar e dos índices de conforto térmico na primavera, verão e outono, enquanto que no inverno não foi constatado eficácia do material. Dentre as estações estudadas, o verão e a primavera, demonstraram serem as épocas mais críticas para criação de aves corte em instalações avícolas que apresentem características semelhantes aos protótipos experimentais. In this study, {{the study}} of the potential use of <b>cement</b> <b>bags</b> and long-life packaging is considered in order to add value to this waste, by manufacturing particleboards as insulating panels in poultry house facilities. For the production of this material <b>cement</b> <b>bags</b> discarded in civil works, long-life packaging discarded by consumers and two-component polyurethane resin based on castor oil base were used. The study was structured in four steps: 1) Characterization of the raw material (<b>cement</b> <b>bags),</b> 2) Effect of the density and the level of resin on the physical, mechanical and thermal properties of <b>cement</b> particles <b>bag</b> panels, 3) Evaluation of long-life packaging and varnish as a coating of selected panels in precedent step and 4) Evaluation of thermal performance of poultry prototypes in reduced and distorted scale with the long-life packaging as a coating material. The <b>cement</b> <b>bags</b> were disintegrated and transformed into particles with the 8 % of moisture content. Subsequently, these particles were mixed with bicomponent polyurethane based on castor oil resin and taken into a planetary mixer (MT 120) in order to homogenize the mixture of the particles with the resin. Panels were made for three different densities (0. 4, 0. 5 and 0. 6 g. cm- 3) with two resin levels (12 and 15 %) and their physical, mechanical and thermal properties were evaluated. Because the panel with 0. 6 g. cm- 3 and 12 % resin have shown a better performance in the investigated properties, this combination has been selected to evaluate the performance of the material (physical, mechanical and thermal) when coated with long-life packaging, adopting the control and the varnish as a comparative coating. Among the evaluated coatings, panels with long-life packaging, presented higher performance than those coated with varnish regarding their physical, mechanical and thermal properties. Thus, the combination of 0. 6 g. cm- 3 and 12 % resin coated long-life packages were tested as lining according the thermal performance (spring, summer, autumn and winter) in prototypes and small-distorted scale by determining thermal comfort indices (Enthalpy and IAPfc) for broilers. The association of lining under the prototype reduced indoor air temperature and thermal comfort indices in spring, summer and autumn, while during the winter no effectiveness of the material was observed. Among the studied seasons, the spring and summer, proved to be the most critical time for cut birds breeding in poultry houses that have characteristics similar to experimental prototypes...|$|R

The kraft paper residue (KPR) was used as shredded particles in different quantities, 30 %, 40 % and 50 %, by weight, and also cutted in sheets to be used as laminas. Tensile and flexural tests were performed to characterize the KPR composites. The results showed that tensile strength and modulus of elasticity increase as shredded KPR content increase. Higher increase was observed when KPR laminas were used as reinforcement. In flexion, a decrease is reported when shredded KPR is used but an increase was observed due to KPR laminas. Flexural modulus was not altered by KPR...|$|R
