5|$|Impact on hunting: Semiautomatic rifles {{have been}} purposefully used for {{hunting in the}} Czech Republic since at least 1946 and they are {{especially}} effective and popular in curbing wild boar overpopulation {{that is responsible for}} large number of <b>car</b> <b>accidents</b> as well as damage to agriculture. Banning of these firearms would likely lead to increase of <b>car</b> <b>accidents</b> due to collisions with wild animals and consequent increase in number of injuries and fatalities.|$|E

5|$|In South Korea, {{eight people}} were killed and damage figures equated to US$71million. Widespread power outages took a toll on as many as 422,000homes and heavy rains flooded {{numerous}} fields of crops. Minor damage occurred in North Korea, though the damage wrought by Typhoon Prapiroon earlier in the month was exacerbated by Saomai's impacts. In Russia, where the typhoon made landfall as an extratropical storm, nine {{people were killed}} due to <b>car</b> <b>accidents</b> spurred by rainfall caused by the Saomai. Overall, Saomai's affects resulted in the death of 28people and roughly US$295million in damage.|$|E

40|$|The traffic {{accidents}} can {{originate in the}} consequence of the human failure, because of the technical failure or the poor technical state of the vehicle, the fault of bad state of the environment, in witch the driver moves or in the consequence of {{the combination of the}} above mentioned factor. A serious <b>car</b> <b>accident</b> {{as a result of a}} human failure will be presented in the article. The important parameters of roads and their equipment that could influence the origin of the <b>car</b> <b>accident</b> in the spot of the <b>car</b> <b>accident</b> were checked. Technical faults of vehicles were not found and were not enforced. The example of the <b>car</b> <b>accident</b> is one of those documenting the need of the educational action to the driver...|$|R
5|$|One {{can also}} {{calculate}} auto fatalities per driver's license. From 1990 to 2009, this number {{has also been}} improving: from 1 death per 3,745 driver's licenses in 1990 to 1 per 6,200 driver's licenses in 2009. Crowded, traffic-choked Northeastern cities including Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Boston, Providence, Philadelphia, Newark, Hartford, New Haven, Springfield and Worcester, Massachusetts, {{were most likely to}} have <b>car</b> <b>accidents.</b> The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration through its Fatality Analysis Reporting System stated that auto fatalities continue to be {{the leading cause of death}} for young adults.|$|E
5|$|Parliament is {{not bound}} by the common law, {{and as a result}} several acts of {{parliament}} unwittingly create valid exceptions to the doctrine of privity. Under the Road Traffic Act 1988, motorists are obliged to take out third party liability insurance. This means that victims of <b>car</b> <b>accidents</b> can claim money from the insurer of the driver at fault, even though they {{are not part of the}} original contract. Under the Married Women's Property Act 1882 a husband can take out insurance in his own name, but make it enforceable by his wife and children despite the doctrine of privity.|$|E
5|$|Moderate {{rainfall}} from Kyle in South Carolina {{peaked at}} 6.35inches (161mm) in Edisto Beach, with the precipitation resulting in minor urban flooding. In and around St. Stephen, flooding reached several feet in depth in roads and buildings; there, {{a nursing home}} had to be evacuated because of flooding. High waters in Manning severely damaged 17mobile homes, forcing about 50people to move to shelters. Ten <b>car</b> <b>accidents</b> were reported in Florence. The tropical storm spawned an F2 tornado in Georgetown that remained {{on the ground for}} about 1.25miles (2km). At its peak strength, the tornado overturned five mobile homes and a car. The tornado destroyed seven homes and damaged 106buildings, 28severely. Eight people were injured by the tornado.|$|E

5|$|Prior to Bonnie moving ashore, 22,000people were {{evacuated}} in Texas and Louisiana. Upon making landfall, Hurricane Bonnie produced a storm surge peaking at 5.2feet (1.5m) at Sabine Pass. Rainfall {{from the storm}} peaked at 13 inches (330mm) in Ace, Texas, which caused some street flooding and destroyed a small dam in Liberty County, Texas. Three fatalities were reported in the Port Arthur, Texas area; two deaths were from separate <b>car</b> <b>accidents</b> and another occurred after a partially paralyzed woman died in a house fire. Flooding also impacted northwestern Louisiana. In the Shreveport area alone, 381homes, 20businesses, and 80major highway intersections were flooded. The hurricane also spawned 11 tornadoes, destroying about 25houses in southwestern Louisiana. Overall, Hurricane Bonnie caused $42 million (1986USD) in damage and five fatalities.|$|E
5|$|Debby also dropped up to 12inches (30.5mm) of {{rainfall}} across Puerto Rico {{in less than}} 48hours, causing mudslides and damage to bridges and roads; however, most of the island territory only received 3inches (7.62mm) of precipitation. The maximum rainfall on the island was 12.63inches (32mm) in Río Piedras, Puerto Rico. Additionally, 12.16inches (31mm) of precipitation was recorded near Cayey, though there were unofficial reports of 17inches (43mm) in the interior mountains of the region. The hurricane dropped around 5inches (127mm) of rain in San Juan, producing slick roads that resulted in several minor <b>car</b> <b>accidents.</b> There were 406homes affected from the flooding, 5of which were moderately to severely damaged. Losses in Puerto Rico reached $501,000, primarily in the Caguas municipality. The storm was also indirectly {{responsible for the death}} of a 78-year-old man who fell while trying to remove a satellite dish from the roof of his home.|$|E
5|$|In the {{majority}} of cases the damage results from physical trauma such as <b>car</b> <b>accidents,</b> gunshots, falls, or sports injuries, but it can also result from nontraumatic causes such as infection, insufficient blood flow, and tumors. Efforts to prevent SCI include individual measures such as using safety equipment, societal measures such as safety regulations in sports and traffic, and improvements to equipment. Known since ancient times to be a catastrophic injury and long believed to be untreatable, SCI has seen great improvements in its care since the middle of the 20th century. Treatment of spinal cord injuries starts with stabilizing the spine and controlling inflammation to prevent further damage. Other interventions needed can vary widely depending on the location and extent of the injury, from bed rest to surgery. In many cases, spinal cord injuries require substantial, long-term physical and occupational therapy in rehabilitation, especially if they interfere with activities of daily living. Research into new treatments for spinal cord injuries includes stem cell implantation, engineered materials for tissue support, and wearable robotic exoskeletons.|$|E

5|$|The {{unusually large}} wind field uprooted many {{thousands}} of trees, downed many power lines, damaged hundreds of houses, and snapped thousands of telephone poles and cross arms. Hundreds of roads, including major highways, were blocked by fallen trees. An emergency evacuation shelter in Newport News reported minor wind damage. Two {{people in the region}} died due to falling trees—one in New Kent County and one in the city of Hopewell. Power outages left most traffic lights not working across Hampton Roads, resulting in multiple minor <b>car</b> <b>accidents.</b> Additionally, most gas stations were closed, due to power outages leaving the pumps unusable. Old Dominion University remained closed for two weeks due to storm damage and power issues, the longest it has ever been closed during a school term. Likewise, Norfolk State University, Regent University, Tidewater Community College and Eastern Virginia Medical School all experienced significant closing times due to both storm damage and a lack of electricity.|$|E
5|$|Light {{rainfall}} and gusty winds caused minor damage in Barbuda, Saint Martin, and Trinidad and Tobago. In the United States Virgin Islands, brief blackouts and damage reaching $200,000 (2000USD) was reported. Effects were most severe in Puerto Rico, where isolated locations experienced more than 12inches (300mm) of rainfall. The heavy precipitation resulted in mudslides and flooding, {{which in turn}} damaged roads, bridges, and houses. At least 406homes on the island were flooded, five of which suffered moderate to severe damage. Additionally, there were many <b>car</b> <b>accidents</b> in San Juan due to slick roads. One indirectly fatality was reported after a man fell off his roof while attempting to remove a satellite dish. Damage {{on the island of}} Puerto Rico reached $501,000. In Dominican Republic, the Civil Defense Force reported that severe flooding in the northern portions of that country caused the evacuation of more than 700people. Overall, the storm caused roughly $35,000 in damage across the island. Impact was lesser in Haiti, where squalls tore tin roofs off of numerous shanty homes and subsequently flooded a few. Additionally, rainfall in Cuba brought relief to an 8month long drought impacting the region.|$|E
