The community as a point of reference for individual identity is composed of territory, identification of affective bonds, solidarity and communicative commitment with regards to values. The structure of the group and the funtions of the <b>community</b> <b>animator</b> should be combined through active participation in the creation of a collective conscience in the field of Social Work. Territorial analysis tries to improve the conditions which favour the phenomena of mutual help and reciprocity thereby favouring the social progress of a particular community...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{movies like}} the “Avathar” {{are a good}} example of the {{stunning}} visual effects that the animation could bring into a movie. The 3 D wireframe models are converted to 3 D photorealistic images using a process called the rendering. This rendering process is offered as a service in the cloud, where the animation files to be rendered are split into frames and rendered in the cloud resources and are popularly known as Rendering-as-a-Service (RaaS). As this is gaining high popularity among the <b>animators</b> <b>community,</b> this work intends to enable the animators to: (a) Gain basic knowledge about Rendering-as-a-Service (RaaS). (b) Understand the variety in the RaaS service models through the taxonomy (c) Explore, compare and classify the RaaS services quickly using the tree-structured taxonomy of services. In this paper, the various characteristics of the RaaS services are organized in the form of a tree to enable quick classification and comparison of the RaaS services. To enhance the understandability, three popular RaaS services have been classified and verified according to the proposed tree-structured taxonomy...|$|R

50|$|PROJECT OVERVIEWThe Kparblee District Development Association (KPADDA) Inc {{is seeking}} for {{a grant of}} one hundred and sixteen {{thousand}} ninety nine hundred and fifty cent United States dollars (USD$116,099.50) {{for the purpose of}} reconciliation and peace building in the district. This grant will be used to reunite the people of Kparblee district through series of reconciliation conferences and peace building initiatives in the district. Stakeholder’s conference will be used as a medium to exchange views and to encourage the input of all grass rooters and elders of the district. A District Peace Plan (DPP) will be adopted {{at the end of the}} process with a District Peace Council (DPC) put in place. This district peace council will rely on the <b>community</b> peace <b>animators</b> that will work with community conflict management teams that to ensure that the peace plan is followed. The term of reference of the conflict management team will be to reduce litigation in the district and serve as first point of contact for conflicts in the communities. This team will work with the courts in the district to discourage citizens going to court with one another. Reconciliatory feasts and tournaments will be held between town and chiefdoms within the district. All are aimed towards reconciling the people of the district. 552264STAKEHOLDER ANALYSISThe stake holders in this process can be categorized into three segments. The People of Glarlay, Behwallay and Dubuzon are on the one hand, the people of Kparblee, and Youkoway are on another while the Gios and Krahns are on the final hand.The attempted murder of Manniadey from Behwallay led to the killing of Mamadee Fofana, a driver and a popular citizen of Glarlay by an AFL soldier believed to be from Dubuzon. Another version of the saga was one Dennis from Behwallay encouraged the killing of the Gios when he spoke the local vernacular of the fleeing villagers to encourage them to come back only to be killed. Their return resulted in mass death that escalated to the point that the district found itself in revenge killings that has divided this it today. To date these towns still hold it against one another. For example, in 2006 there was a teachers training program organized through the Accelerated Learning Program project. This training was held in Ganta with over sixty teachers from the entire district. To our dismay, teachers from Beatuo and other Gio speaking communities were afraid to sleep with those from the Krahn sector in the hotel rooms. This if not properly curtailed will lead to total collapse of peace in the district.|$|R
40|$|AbstractCollaborative {{innovation}} networks (COINs) and swarm {{creativity is}} often studied {{in a professional}} business context. We propose that studying COINs of amateurs and non-business contexts provides a crucial and complementary perspective on these phenomena. By broadening the scope of COINs research to encompass these edge cases, {{we can begin to}} identify patterns and trends that persist across different contexts. For the past three years, we have been studying COINs in a novel context: online <b>communities</b> of Flash <b>animators</b> who collaborate over the internet to create animated movies and games called “collabs. ” From a quantitative analysis of nearly 900 collabs on Newgrounds. com, we found that these projects can be highly successful, attracting hundreds of thousands of Internet audience members to download the completed animations. Our analysis also demonstrated that is possible to predict the success potential of a collab by examining specific factors, including attributes of the leader, organizational structures, and activity patterns within a collab. Our focus in this research has been on the social dynamics within collabs, especially the role of leadership. Through in-depth interviews with collab participants, we found that collabs are typically created by groups of amateurs, or in some cases, animation students, often located around the world and speaking different languages. Their motivations tend to be socialpsychological—such as learning, reputation, social support, and self-efficacy—rather than financial, and almost everyone contributes as an unpaid volunteer. We also found that a shared goal of almost every collab participants with whom we spoke was to create something original; that is, a movie or game that audiences perceived as unique. To this end, collab participants are constantly experimenting with new processes, team compositions, and artistic styles. We have identified notable similarities and differences between collabs and other COINs involved with entertainment production. Collab participants emulate the professional filmmaking community in that they recruit mainly through social networks; in contrast to movie studios, however, collabs are organized entirely online, via discussion forums, blogs, and instant messaging. This process is facilitated by online reputation markers, such as digital histories of past contributions. Another similarity between the film set and the collab production process is that both operate in a hierarchical fashion, with one individual at the top, the “benevolent dictator,” maintaining the ultimate creative direction and authority. This finding contradicts the received wisdom of online collaborations, which holds that flattened hierarchies make decisions in a democratic or meritocratic fashion. Finally, in contrast to professional filmmaking, we found that the division of labor in collabs is often modularized, rather than specialized. Collab leaders typically assign entire scenes to individual animators to be recombined upon completion. This modularization allows animators to work independently and in parallel to sidestep some of the challenges posed by distributed collaboration. The breadth and potential of COINs, as illuminated by our ongoing study of collabs, continues to surprise and inspire us. Our future work includes (1) developing software tools to support collabs and (2) relating these findings to other forms of online creative collaboration...|$|R
