50|$|Frances Hashimoto is {{credited}} as {{creator of the}} popular mochi ice cream. She also spearheaded the line's introduction to the American market. Hashimoto's husband, Joel Friedman, initially conceived the idea of wrapping small orbs of ice cream with a coating of mochi, a sweet Japanese rice cake, during the early 1990s. Hashimoto expanded on the idea, offering seven flavors of mochi ice cream made by Mikawaya. The mochi ice <b>cream</b> <b>line</b> proved a hit with consumers, expanding Mikawaya from more traditional Japanese pastries like chestnut buns or rice cakes. Mikawaya now sells its mochi ice cream in Whole foods, Albertsons, Trader Joe's, Ralphs, and Safeway. Mochi ice cream now accounts {{for the majority of}} Mikawaya's sales.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve a {{reliable}} degree of quality, the pharmaceutical industry needs to introduce a quality control system that includes validation of the cleaning of equipment. This study carried out cleaning validation on the dexamethasone <b>cream</b> production <b>line.</b> The validation study involved evaluation of the cleaning procedures for the dexamethasone <b>cream</b> production <b>line.</b> Samples were collected at thirteen points involving the reactor, the colloidal mill, the industrial blender, the mixer and the packaging machine, {{for each of the}} batches.

Cleaning was shown to be within the stipulated parameters (acceptable level = 9. 95 μg/mL) for: residues of active ingredient, TOC, pH, conductivity and microbiological contamination. It was thus concluded that the strategy adopted for cleaning validation was simple, swift, and efficient and capable of being applied to other kinds of pharmaceutical products...|$|R
