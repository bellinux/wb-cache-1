6000|$|The other {{circumstance}} {{occurred at}} home. Opposite {{our house in}} Bethel stood the old stage tavern where [...] "man and beast" [...] found accommodation, The stable-man was rather dissipated, but possessed of some humor. On my return I found him parading the streets, and attending in the stable, barefooted, but {{in a pair of}} sky-blue nankeen pantaloons--just the color of my uniform trousers--with a strip of white <b>cotton</b> <b>sheeting</b> sewed down the outside seams in imitation of mine. The joke was a huge one in the mind of many of the people, and was much enjoyed by them; but I did not appreciate it so highly.|$|E

50|$|The Davol Mills Company was {{organized}} in 1866, with nineteen persons, with initial capital set at $270,000, and {{named in honor}} of William C. Davol, a machinery builder who is credited with importing the Roberts Self-acting Mule from Great Britain to Fall River in the early 1840s. Mill No. 1 was built in 1867 at the corner of Rodman Street and Eight Rod Way (now known as Plymouth Avenue). The machinery was in operation by March 1868. The Davol Mills initially produced <b>cotton</b> shirtings, <b>sheetings,</b> silesias and fancy fabrics.|$|R

60|$|I had {{a brother}} in Chicopee Falls who owned manufactories--cotton, or sugar, or A. A. sheetings, or {{something}} in the commercial line. He was vulgarly rich, and therefore reverenced art. The artistic temperament of the family was monopolized at my birth. I knew that Brother James would honor my slightest wish. I would demand from him a position in <b>cotton,</b> sugar, or <b>sheetings</b> for William Trotter--something, say, at two hundred a month or thereabouts. I confided my beliefs and made my large propositions to William. He had pleased me much, and he was ragged.|$|R
50|$|Dallas Mill was a {{manufacturer}} of <b>cotton</b> <b>sheeting</b> in Huntsville, Alabama, United States. The first of four major textile mills in Huntsville, the mill operated from 1891 until 1949, before it was converted {{for use as a}} warehouse in 1955 and burned in 1991. The village, constructed to house workers and their families, was incorporated into the city in 1955. The mill and its mill village are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

5000|$|Named for a Mohegan {{word meaning}} [...] "Pleasant Valley" [...] Wauregan {{has a long}} history as an {{industrial}} village. In 1850, Amos D. Lockwood, who was involved with the Quinebaug Mill in Danielsonville, bought the water privileges and surrounding land at Wauregan. After the Wauregan Mills Company charter was approved by the Connecticut legislature in 1853, the first mill was constructed circa 1853-1854. Wauregan Mills was well known for its woven cotton goods, including various types of flannel. Lockwood became the mill's first agent and recruited James S. Atwood as his superintendent, who became responsible for setting up all machinery and starting production. The principal product of Wauregan was <b>cotton</b> <b>sheeting.</b>|$|E
50|$|Butcher {{was able}} to save some of his teacher's salary, and to borrow enough more to open the first {{photography}} studio in Custer County. The studio was housed in a lath-and-adobe building, measuring 18 x 28 ft, with a dirt floor and with <b>cotton</b> <b>sheeting</b> in lieu of glass to cover the windows and the skylights. As a backdrop for the photos, he used an old cloth wagon cover. The cloth had been gnawed by rats and was full of holes, which Lillie patched.

50|$|When James S. Atwood died, {{management}} of Wauregan Mills was {{passed on to}} his twin sons, James Arthur and John Walter Atwood. The Atwood brothers continued to expand and improve the mill, which employed 325 men and 160 women and children as of 1917. The Atwood brothers successfully responded to the competition of the newer, steam-powered mills by producing finer quality cotton goods such as shirting for the U.S. Marine Corps, and later rayon, instead of the traditional <b>cotton</b> <b>sheeting.</b> Wauregan Mills had a close working relationship with DuPont {{and was one of}} the pioneers of synthetic fabric. This partnership led to the development of the technology to produce fabric made of a blend of wool and rayon. In contrast to many larger, corporate-owned mills that were wedded to a particular product, the economic organization of Wauregan Mills enabled its owner/managers to easily diversify and change its product mix to meet new demands resulting from competition from newer textile centers, allowing them to stay profitable through World War II, much longer than many other larger mills.|$|E

40|$|The {{persistence}} of Salmonella typhimurium (V- 31) on wool blanket, wool gabardine, <b>cotton</b> <b>sheeting,</b> cotton knit jersey, cotton terry cloth, and cotton wash-and-wear fabrics was studied. Three methods of exposure {{were employed to}} contaminate the fabrics: direct contact, aerosol, and a lyophilized mixture of bacteria and dust having a high content of textile fibers. After contamination, the fabrics were held in 35 or 78 % relative humidity at 25 C. The persistence time of S. typhimurium on fabrics held in 35 % relative humidity was substantially longer when the fabrics were contaminated by direct contact or by exposure to dust containing bacteria than when contaminated by exposure to aerosolized cultures. Viable bacterial populations persisted for 24 weeks at relatively high population densities on swatches of wool gabardine, <b>cotton</b> <b>sheeting,</b> cotton knit jersey, and cotton terry cloth exposed by direct contact and held in a humidity of 35 %. In 78 % humidity, bacterial populations persisted on the fabrics for relatively shorter periods of time regardless of the mode of contamination or fabric type. This organism retained its virulence for Swiss mice after being recovered from wool gabardine swatches held 8 weeks in humidities of 35 or 78 % and from cotton terry cloth swatches held 6 weeks in the same humidities...|$|E
40|$|False Sense of Care is {{the thesis}} {{exhibition}} by Mary Margaret Sandbothe. The exhibition incorporated two bodies of work titled, Ideal Queers comprised of large format digitally printed cross-stitch simulations on <b>cotton</b> <b>sheeting,</b> and Patterns of Exclusion {{a series of}} transparent cross-stitch templates with a light box for viewing. This work exposes queer assimilation tactics merging advertising imagery with cross-stitch samplers. By deconstructing images of heteronormative family archetypes, the works reveal an uneasiness toward the typical portrayals of queer identities. Cross-stitch filters coupled with advertising language promote {{a false sense of}} care meant to sell the viewer a particular identity, brand or item. Through analyzing these mainstream representations, this exhibition critiques queer assimilation tactics within advertising and displays the absence of those outside of the ideal queer representation...|$|E
40|$|The {{persistence}} of vaccinia virus on wool (blanket and gabardine) and <b>cotton</b> (<b>sheeting,</b> terry cloth, and knit jersey) fabrics was studied. The fabrics {{were exposed to}} the virus by three methods: direct contact, aerosol, and virus-containing dust having a high content of textile fibers. Fabrics exposed to virus by each method were held in 35 and 78 % relative humidities at 25 C. Virus was recovered for up to 14 weeks from wool fabrics exposed to virus and held in the low humidity. In contrast, virus persisted for shorter periods of time on the cotton fabrics. No virus was detected on terry cloth as early as 3 days after exposure to virus. The virus appeared to be less stable in the high humidity, and the method of exposure of the fabrics to virus apparently had an effect upon the {{persistence of}} the agent. On all fabrics, viral persistence was of sufficient duration to be of epidemiological significance...|$|E
40|$|The {{length of}} time that {{poliovirus}} could be recovered from wool gabardine and blanket, and from <b>cotton</b> <b>sheeting,</b> terry cloth, and knit jersey fabrics was determined under conditions of controlled temperature and humidity (25 C in 35 and 78 % relative humidities). Three types of exposure of the fabrics to viruses were used: direct contact, aerosol, and virus-containing household dust having a high content of textile fibers. When held in 35 % relative humidity, virus persisted for 20 weeks on wool fabrics, but only 1 to 4 weeks on cotton fabrics. At this relative humidity, virus titers on wool fabrics decreased rapidly to low but detectable levels which persisted {{for long periods of}} time, whereas in 78 % relative humidity the decrease in virus titer was less rapid, but the period of viral persistence was shorter. Generally, virus titers on cotton fabrics held in both relative humidities decreased exponentially to an undetectable level. The method of exposure to virus had a definite effect on the duration of viral persistence on a given fabric. Virus contained in household dust was least stable...|$|E
40|$|The {{persistence}} of Staphylococcus aureus (Smith) on wool blanket, wool gabardine, <b>cotton</b> <b>sheeting,</b> cotton knit jersey, cotton terry cloth, and cotton wash-and-wear fabrics was studied. The fabrics {{were exposed to}} bacterial populations by three methods: direct contact, aerosol, and a lyophilized mixture of bacteria and dust having a high content of textile fibers. The contaminated fabrics were held in 35 or 78 % relative humidities at 25 C. In general, the persistence time of S. aureus populations on fabrics held in 35 % relative humidity was substantially longer when the fabrics were contaminated by exposure to aerosolized cultures or to dust containing bacteria than when contaminated by direct contact. In a 78 % relative humidity, bacterial populations on the fabrics persisted for substantially shorter periods of time regardless of the mode of contamination or fabric type. Cotton wash-and-wear fabric (treated with a modified triazone resin) was the material on which populations of S. aureus persisted for the shortest time. This organism retained its virulence for Swiss mice after being recovered from wool gabardine swatches held 4 weeks in 35 % relative humidity and 6 weeks in 78 % relative humidity...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{laundering}} with both anionic and nonionic detergents in cold, warm, and hot water on poliovirus-contaminated <b>cotton</b> <b>sheeting,</b> cotton terry cloth, washable wool shirting, wool blanketing, dull nylon jersey, and dacron/cotton shirting were determined. The fabrics {{were exposed to}} virus by aerosolization and direct contact (pipette) in separate studies. Although the results varied with each factor used in the study, virus titers on all the fabrics were generally reduced considerably by the laundering process. When the fabrics were dried for 20 hr after laundering, an additional decline in virus titers was seen, often to below detectable levels. The type of detergent used made little difference in effect on virus titer reduction, but the hot wash water markedly reduced the detectable virus. Fabric type was not {{a major factor in}} the majority of the experiments, although virus tended to be eliminated more readily from the nylon jersey, and in warm water the virus persisted longer on wool blanketing material laundered in anionic detergent. Sterile fabrics of each type laundered with similar fabrics which contained virus often became contaminated by the virus during the laundering process. Virus titers ranging from undetectable to 103. 9 cell culture 50 % infectious doses/ml were obtained from samples of the rinse water after warm- and cold-water laundering...|$|E
40|$|Eight {{compounds}} {{were tested}} in vitro for virucidal and antiviral activity against poliovirus and vaccinia virus. These compounds included five quaternary ammonium salts, two bromosalicylanilides, and neomycin sulfate, an antibiotic. None of the compounds was active against poliovirus, but virucidal activity was demonstrated against vaccinia virus with three of the quarternary ammonium compounds: n-alkyl (C 14, C 12, C 16) dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride, di-isobutyl cresoxy ethoxy ethyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride monohydrate, and n-alkyl (60 % C 14, 30 % C 16, 5 % C 12, 5 % C 18) dimethyl benzyl ammonium chlorides plus n-alkyl (50 % C 12, 30 % C 14, 17 % C 16, 3 % C 18) dimethyl ethylbenzyl ammonium chlorides. Wool blanketing, wool gabardine, and <b>cotton</b> <b>sheeting</b> materials were impregnated with {{the first of the}} above virucidal compounds, and the persistence of vaccinia virus on these fabrics was compared with the persistence of the agent on nonimpregnated fabrics of the same type held at 25 C in 35 and 78 % relative humidity. No virus could be recovered from the chemically treated fabrics at any time after virus exposure, whereas the virus persisted as long as 4 weeks on nonimpregnated materials. Viable vaccinia virus was also found to persist less than 1 day on a cotton fabric finished with a wash-and-wear modified triazone resin. Poliovirus persisted less than 5 days on this wash-and-wear fabric...|$|E
40|$|Joy??? expresses {{perfectly}} {{my intention}} in life, and clay is my chosen medium to convey it. There {{are too many}} daily issues that {{must be dealt with}} that have the opposite effect of joy. I would like my work {{to be a source of}} delight, to reveal happiness, fun, excitement, and to create a fantasy that blocks out the negativity in the world. I work, in general,. with slabs of clay pressed through a slab-roller with wrinkled <b>cotton</b> <b>sheeting</b> on top of them. The imprint of the sheeting leaves an abstract design which I use in building my forms and also when I glaze them. I began to explore the handbuilt teapot form from which developed entire tableware sets, subsequently leading total environments of ceramics, utensils and tables. Handbuilding enables me to create non-traditional forms which have evolved into my present style of tableware. Color is of prime importance to me as it expresses joy. For me, color is most easily defined by that seen in a rainbow. I use white stoneware for its durability and the ease it allows in forming whimsical shapes. The white clay also serves as a better surface for color than dark clay. Philosophically, I feel that brightly colored glazed pieces enhance the areas that they occupy and lighten the spirits of the people who experience them. Form, col or and function are what I have found to be of concern to me. My discovery of the majolica technique was made during a lecture by Vivika Heino. This was a great stroke of luck for me as it offered me just what I was looking for. The name 'majolica' comes from Majorca. (Daniel Rhodes, Clay and Glazes for the Potter, Radnor, Pennsylvania: Chilton Book Company, 1973, p. 259.) It is an overglaze technique in which the raw base glaze, usually white or light-colored, is first put on bisqued ware. Colored overglazes are then painted on top of this raw background glaze. Although majolica glazes are generally thought to be lowfired, the one that I use is fired between Cone 8 and 10 in an oxidation atmosphere. The formula for the base glaze is: Custer Feldspar 52. 3...|$|E
