The effect of two common <b>cast</b> <b>materials,</b> polyester and Plaster of Paris was investigated by performing both in vitro and in vivo studies. The in vitro study tested the effect of increasing layers of <b>cast</b> <b>material</b> on bone density measurements performed on a hydroxyapatite phantom.

Casting process generally is classified as expendable mold or permanent mold. These researches consist of design and fabricate mould for die casting process and analyze the structure and surfaces of the <b>casted</b> <b>materials.</b> Objective of the research is to design and fabricates mold for tensile test specimen, following ASTM E 8 standard and to analysis the surface and structure of <b>casted</b> <b>material.</b> Material {{that has been used}} for mold is mild steel meanwhile <b>casted</b> <b>material</b> is aluminum alloys. Furthermore, this research is consisting of several main processes which mold is design by Solidwork software and simulation for machining process is done by mastercam software. Meanwhile, fabrication process is done by CNC milling machine and finally perform casting process to produce <b>casted</b> <b>materials.</b> Subsequently, these researches were carried out in order to analyze the effect of surface roughness, dimension and thickness values on <b>casted</b> <b>material</b> by 3 different pre-heated temperatures. For these experiments, 3 measurements were measured at 3 <b>casted</b> <b>materials</b> from three different pre-heated mold temperatures. Therefore, 100 °c, 250 °c and 350 °c temperatures were tested to observe the effects of surface roughness, dimension and thickness of <b>casted</b> <b>material.</b> For surface roughness,the analysis of results indicated the value of surface roughness does not affected by different preheated temperature. Other than that, the values of thickness and dimensions of the <b>casted</b> <b>material</b> were slightly decreased at different pre-heated temperature. When the dimension and thickness pre-heated at 150 °c, the values decreased compared with other pre-heated temperature. For pre-heated mold temperature 150 °c, the dimension and thickness values are 8. 18 mm and 3. 29 mm. Meanwhile, for 250 °c and 350 °c pre-heated mold temperature, the dimension and thickness values is 12. 55 mm, 12. 57 mm, 3. 37 mm and 3. 54 mm. For pre- heated temperature 200 °c and 350 °c, the values of dimension and thickness not significantly different. In addition, the morphology examinations through scanning electron microscope (SEM) were examined in order to investigate the effects of porosity defects by different pre-heated mold temperature. The result shows that porosity still occurred at <b>casted</b> <b>material</b> with different pre-heated mold temperatures. However, for pre- heated 150 °c mold temperature, porosity occurred more than other pre-heated mold temperature. It proved that the undesirable pre-heated mold temperatures causes more porosity will occurred on <b>casted</b> <b>material.</b> The appropriate pre-heated temperature is 280 °c and 350 °c for aluminum alloys to produce good casted products...|$|R

The thin <b>cast</b> <b>material</b> exhibited a much finer as-quenched microstructure than the bulk material with the IMC phase restricted to a thin network. Both the bulk and thin <b>cast</b> <b>materials</b> continually softened during room temperature aging, while both materials initially softened and then subsequently hardened when aged at 120 0 C and 180 0 C. The thin <b>cast</b> <b>material</b> was {{in all cases}} significantly softer than the bulk material, and responded to aging {{as if it were}} bulk material aged at a higher temperature.

Materials that have been used for mould is mild steel and for <b>casted</b> <b>material</b> is aluminum alloy. Overall, this project was run based on four main steps; design using Solid Work, running a simulation on Master CAM, fabricated using CNC Milling Machine, and finally casting process.

The result shows the hardness of <b>casted</b> <b>material</b> immersed in water has higher value compared to oil and air.

Two novel processes were adopted. One was repeated thermomechanical treatment (RTMT), which involves a repetition of a multi-step cold-working followed by heat treatment.

By applying these processes, refined microstructures were successfully obtained. Microstructural refinement by RTMT resulted in the avoidance of early fracture that was detected in the <b>cast</b> <b>material</b> by a tensile test.
