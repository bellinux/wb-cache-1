Although, as in many developing countries, institutional capacity is a concern, adopting a more formal framework could impel the kind of changes that are required to strengthen the ability of the CBY in achieving low and stable rates of inflation over the medium term.

The paper also examines the issue of the autonomy of <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> in Jordan given the influence of world interest rates. Although, Jordan operates an exchange rate peg, which has been fixed to the USD since 1995, there is some room for flexibility in operating <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> in the short-run, where the CBJ has some autonomy in determining the spread between domestic and US interest rates. VAR and VECM results suggest that the response of the policy rate in Jordan to innovations in the US Federal Fund''s rate is less than one-for-one. In the short-run, the CBJ appears to conduct <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> in response to domestic inflation and a measure of the domestic output gap.

The objective of this paper is to review the recent conduct of Chinese <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> and the central bank’s rule-based behavior in period 1994 - 2006 by estimating the <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> rules (<b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> reaction function).

40|$|As China''s economy {{becomes more}} market based and {{continues}} its rapid {{integration into the}} global economy, having an independent and effective <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> regime oriented to domestic objectives will become increasingly important. Employing modern principles of <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> {{in light of the}} current state of China''s financial institutions, we motivate and present a package of proposals to guide the operation of a new <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> regime. Specifically, we recommend an explicit low long-run inflation objective, operational independence for the People''s Bank of China (PBC) with formal strategic guidance from the government, and a minimal set of financial sector reforms (to make the Chinese banking system robust against interest rate fluctuations). We argue that anchoring <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> with an explicit inflation objective would be the most reliable way for the PBC to tie down inflation expectations, and thereby enable <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> to make the best contribution to macroeconomic and financial stability, as well as economic growth. The management and monitoring of money (and credit) growth by the PBC would continue to play a useful role in the stabilization of inflation, but a money target would not constitute a good stand-alone nominal anchor.

This is of particular interest, since the monetary conditionality in IMF-supported programs has traditionally been linked to central bank balance sheet items. Quantity targeting tends to be practiced today mostly in countries in which money markets are not yet well-developed or a monetary aggregate is used as the intermediate target. Most other central banks prefer to target a short-term interest rate, which results in day-to-day changes in balance sheet items becoming endogenous.
