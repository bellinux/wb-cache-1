40|$|The <b>clover</b> <b>seed</b> <b>weevils</b> Apion fulvipes Geoffroy, 1785 and Apion trifolii L., 1768 (Coleoptera: Apionidae) cause major {{losses to}} seed {{production}} of white clover (Trifolium repens L.) and red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), respectively. Clover is important as animal forage and {{an alternative to}} inorganic fertilizers. Because clover is mainly pollinated by bees, the use of insecticides in management of these weevils is discouraged. To gain basic knowledge for development of alternative management strategies, we investigated weevil field abundance over two growing seasons, as well as feeding and olfactory host preferences by A. fulvipes and A. trifolii. Field trap catches in southern Sweden revealed that white clover was dominated by A. fulvipes and red clover by A. trifolii. For both weevil species, female catches were positively correlated {{to the number of}} clover buds and flowers in the field. In feeding and olfactory bioassays, females of A. fulvipes and A. trifolii showed a preference for T. repens and T. pratense, respectively. However, the feeding preference was lost when the antennae were removed, indicating a significant role of olfaction in host choice. Male weevils of both species did not show clear olfactory or feeding preferences for host plant species. The field study and laboratory bioassays demonstrate that, at least for female weevils, olfaction is important for selection of host plants. We discuss these novel results in the context of managing these important pests of clover by exploiting olfaction and behavioral attraction to host plant volatiles...|$|R

We investigated the phylogenetic relationships and population structures of red and gray sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> populations collected {{on either side of the}} Rocky Mountains using nuclear 18 S rDNA, mitochondrial ribosomal DNA, and microsatellites. The results showed that the sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>weevils</b> are sister taxa in a monophyletic clade. No significant relationships attributable to geographic barriers were found. Thirty-three unique mitochondrial 16 S rDNA sequences (haplotypes) were identified and the sequence divergence among haplotypes ranged from 0. 2 to 3. 68 %. Because more individuals per population could be collected for gray sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> than for red, a more detailed study of population structure was possible for this species. Most of the genetic variation observed in gray sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> resulted from variation within populations. Contiguous range expansion appeared to be the main mechanism for increased variability within the species. Significant differences were found in analyses of five polymorphic microsatellite loci in four geographically separated field populations from which multiple individuals could be collected. More genetic differences occurred among weevil populations collected from sunflowers along the East-West axis than among weevil populations collected on a North-South axis. The overall results are consistent with current theories concerning the origin of the sunflower. The population represented by haplotype 33 from Texas is likely a new species that evolved independently. The sample size for this species was limited and additional studies are needed. ...|$|R

40|$|There {{are four}} major insect pests attacking achenes of {{sunflower}} in the Great Plains of North America (Charlet et al., 1987); the red sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>weevil,</b> Smicronyx fulvus LeConte (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), the gray sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>weevil,</b> S. sordidus LeConte (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), the banded sunflower moth, Cochylis hospes (Walsingham) (Lepidoptera: Cochylidae), and the sunflower moth, Homoeosoma electellum (Hulst) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). Identification of achenes damaged by larvae {{of these species}} is important for assessment of yield loss caused by each species (Peng and Brewer, 1995). Achenes infested by the gray sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> are easily identified because they are enlarged and protrude above the surrounding achenes on intact sunflower heads and the kernel is entirely consumed (Brewer, 1991). Descriptions of achenes infested by larvae {{of the other three}} species are similar (Carlson, 1967; Oseto and Braness, 1979; McBride and Charlet, 1991) except for the location of feeding/exit holes {{on the surface of the}} achenes infested by the red sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> and banded sunflower moth (Charlet and Gross, 1990).

A reasonable level of control can be obtained with insecticide sprays together with orchard sanitation, but the only option available for organic growers is the latter. Weaver ants, Oecophylla smaragdina (Fabricius), are effective in controlling the main insect pests in citrus, cashew and mango orchards. To determine whether weaver ants, which are usually abundant in non-sprayed mango orchards, have the potential to control the mango <b>seed</b> <b>weevil,</b> field experiments together with regular monitoring programmes at six orchards in the Northern Territory of Australia were conducted from 2001 to 2003. Data from two conventional orchards showed that the treatment with weaver ants plus soft chemicals produced lower levels of downgraded fruits (< 0. 5 %) compared to the treatment with chemical insecticides (1. 4 - 2. 1 %). In three organic or insecticide-free orchards, fruits were much less damaged on trees with weaver ants (< 1 %) than on trees without the ants (2. 5 - 15. 7 %). In the sixth orchard, that had much higher mango <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> populations than the others, levels of downgraded fruits were lower on trees with abundant weaver ants than on trees with fewer weaver ants. We conclude that weaver ants are efficient biocontrol agents of the mango <b>seed</b> <b>weevil,</b> and that for successful control of the pest it is important both to maintain the ants at high levels and to destroy excess fruits...|$|R

Findings about pest resistance are summarized - resistance types and mechanisms in particular. Then monitoring of resistent populations of plant pests are described. New findings concerning the resistance of three oilseed rape pests were acquired using biological methods. For cabage <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> six areas were evaluated, for pollen beetle seven and for cabbage stem flea beetle two areas were evaluated. All the evaluated areas are in the Czech republic. The adult-vial test number 11, nr. 25, nr. 27 accordinng to IRAC methodology and topical aplication test were used to rate the resistance. The efficiency of five pyrethroids (deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, esfenvalerate, etofenprox, tau-fluvalinate, cypermethrin), one organophosphate (chlorpyrifos - cabbage stem flea beetle only) and one oxadiazin (indoxacarb) in different concentrations were rated.

40|$|The {{agricultural}} landscape {{has gone through}} large changes to meet increasing demands for food. This has led to major biodiversity declines, while effects on ecosystem services that support agricultural productivity, such as pollination and pest control, remain less studied. This thesis examines temporal trends, impacts, and management for functionally important insects in agriculture using red <b>clover</b> <b>seed</b> production as a model system. Red clover is pollinated by bumble bees (Bombus spp.) and honey bees. Major yield losses are caused by <b>seed</b> <b>weevils</b> (Apion spp.), which in turn are attacked by natural enemy parasitoids. Field studies, where sites previously sampled in the 1930 s- 1960 s were revisited 2008 - 2011, showed a shift towards more species poor bumble bee communities in red clover fields dominated by a few species which are less effective pollinators. Moreover, crop pest damage by <b>seed</b> <b>weevils</b> had more than doubled, while parasitism rates provided by natural enemies had decreased. In parallel to these changes, seed yields have declined and become more variable in recent decades. We performed an experiment which showed that the gain in seed set obtained when simultaneously increasing pollination and pest control outweighed the sum of seed set gains obtained when increasing each service separately. With the field data collected we also developed integrated pest management by validating a pest sampling method, developing a threshold for insecticide treatment, and suggesting minimum effective chemical pest control. We further found that pest damage was higher in landscapes with {{a high proportion of}} agricultural land, and that maximising the distance to a clover field in the previous year could function as a proactive method to decrease pest abundance. In summary, this thesis shows that agricultural intensification can jeopardise the supply of crop pollination and pest control services, and that such changes may translate into crop yield effects. It further highlights that interactions between pollination and pest control can alter the benefits obtained from serviceproviding organisms, and this needs to be considered to properly manage multiple ecosystem services. Simultaneous enhancement of beneficial organisms which contribute to crop productivity and integrated management of pests that pose a threat to production can contribute to sustainable food production in agriculture...|$|R

While {{biological control agent}}s have been effectively utilized to manage invasive plant species and preserve existing biodiversity, not all biological control agents are successful. The invasive thistle <b>seed</b> head <b>weevil</b> (Rhinocyllus conicus) was originally introduced to America as a biological control agent to manage musk thistle (Carduus nutans), {{but it has been}} found to attack several species of native thistle. This study examined the movements of the invasive thistle <b>seed</b> head <b>weevil</b> away from musk thistle into two different species of native thistle in the Colorado Front Range: wavyleaf thistle (Cirsium undulatum) and fringed thistle (Cirsium centaureae). Specifically, the proximity of invasive musk thistle to wavyleaf thistle was observed to see if it has any influence on thistle <b>seed</b> head <b>weevil</b> attack upon wavyleaf thistle. Additionally, fringed thistle was observed in three different habitat types in the Colorado Front Range (i. e. meadow, riparian, and tree line habitat) to see if the invasive thistle <b>seed</b> head <b>weevil</b> has been moving up in elevation in response to climate change. The results indicate that the proximity between musk thistle and wavyleaf thistle had no significant effect on thistle <b>seed</b> head <b>weevil</b> abundance on the native thistle. Moreover, the invasive thistle <b>seed</b> head <b>weevil</b> is still restricted to elevations below 3100 meters, meaning the tree line population of fringed thistle are protected from attack.
