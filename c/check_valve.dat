5|$|When {{thermoplastics}} are moulded, typically pelletised {{raw material}} is fed through a hopper into a heated barrel with a reciprocating screw. Upon {{entrance to the}} barrel, the temperature increases and the Van der Waals forces that resist relative flow of individual chains are weakened {{as a result of}} increased space between molecules at higher thermal energy states. This process reduces its viscosity, which enables the polymer to flow with the driving force of the injection unit. The screw delivers the raw material forward, mixes and homogenises the thermal and viscous distributions of the polymer, and reduces the required heating time by mechanically shearing the material and adding a significant amount of frictional heating to the polymer. The material feeds forward through a <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> and collects {{at the front of the}} screw into a volume known as a shot. A shot is the volume of material that is used to fill the mould cavity, compensate for shrinkage, and provide a cushion (approximately 10% of the total shot volume, which remains in the barrel and prevents the screw from bottoming out) to transfer pressure from the screw to the mould cavity. When enough material has gathered, the material is forced at high pressure and velocity into the part forming cavity. To prevent spikes in pressure, the process normally uses a transfer position corresponding to a 95–98% full cavity where the screw shifts from a constant velocity to a constant pressure control. Often injection times are well under 1 second. Once the screw reaches the transfer position the packing pressure is applied, which completes mould filling and compensates for thermal shrinkage, which is quite high for thermoplastics relative to many other materials. The packing pressure is applied until the gate (cavity entrance) solidifies. Due to its small size, the gate is normally the first place to solidify through its entire thickness. Once the gate solidifies, no more material can enter the cavity; accordingly, the screw reciprocates and acquires material for the next cycle while the material within the mould cools so that it can be ejected and be dimensionally stable. This cooling duration is dramatically reduced by the use of cooling lines circulating water or oil from an external temperature controller. Once the required temperature has been achieved, the mould opens and an array of pins, sleeves, strippers, etc. are driven forward to demould the article. Then, the mould closes and the process is repeated.|$|E
25|$|A <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> lets {{gas flow}} in one {{direction}} only. It is usually a chamber containing a ball that is pressed against one end by a spring. Gas flow one way pushes {{the ball out of}} the way, and a lack of flow or a reverse flow allows the spring to push the ball into the inlet, blocking it. Not to be confused with a flashback arrestor, a <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> is not designed to block a shock wave. The shock wave could occur while the ball is so far from the inlet that the wave will get past the ball before it can reach its off position.|$|E
25|$|Between the {{regulator}} and hose, and ideally between hose and torch on both oxygen and fuel lines, a flashback arrestor and/or non-return valve (<b>check</b> <b>valve)</b> should be installed to prevent flame or oxygen-fuel mixture being pushed back into either cylinder and damaging the equipment or causing a cylinder to explode.|$|E
50|$|<b>Check</b> <b>valves</b> {{are often}} used with some types of pumps. Piston-driven and {{diaphragm}} pumps such as metering pumps and pumps for chromatography commonly use inlet and outlet ball <b>check</b> <b>valves.</b> These valves often look like small cylinders attached to the pump head on the inlet and outlet lines. Many similar pump-like mechanisms for moving volumes of fluids around use <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> such as ball <b>check</b> <b>valves.</b> The feed pumps or injectors which supply water to steam boilers are fitted with <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> to prevent back-flow.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Check</b> <b>valves</b> are two-port valves, {{meaning they}} have two {{openings}} in the body, one for fluid to enter {{and the other for}} fluid to leave. There are various types of <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> used {{in a wide variety of}} applications. <b>Check</b> <b>valves</b> are often part of common household items. Although they are available in a wide range of sizes and costs, <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> generally are very small, simple, or inexpensive. <b>Check</b> <b>valves</b> work automatically and most are not controlled by a person or any external control; accordingly, most do not have any valve handle or stem. The bodies (external shells) of most <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> are made of plastic or metal.|$|R

25|$|Since {{the main}} {{reservoir}} pipe is kept constantly pressurized by the locomotive, the car reservoirs can be charged independently of the brake pipe, this being accomplished via a <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> to prevent backfeeding into the pipe. This arrangement helps to reduce the above described pressure loss problems, and also reduces the time required for the brakes to release, since the brake pipe only has to recharge itself.|$|E
25|$|The {{flashback}} arrestor (not {{to be confused}} with a <b>check</b> <b>valve)</b> prevents shock waves from downstream coming back up the hoses and entering the cylinder, possibly rupturing it, as there are quantities of fuel/oxygen mixtures inside parts of the equipment (specifically within the mixer and blowpipe/nozzle) that may explode if the equipment is incorrectly shut down, and acetylene decomposes at excessive pressures or temperatures. In case the pressure wave has created a leak downstream of the {{flashback arrestor}}, it will remain switched off until someone resets it.|$|E
25|$|The main {{circulating}} pumps {{have the capacity}} of 5,500–12,000m³/h and are powered by 6kV electric motors. The normal coolant flow is 8000m³/h per pump; this is throttled down by control valves to 6000–7000m³/h when the reactor power is below 500MWt. Each pump has a flow control valve and a backflow preventing <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> on the outlet, and shutoff valves on both inlet and outlet. Each of the pressure channels in the core has its own flow control valve so that the temperature distribution in the reactor core can be optimized. Each channel has a ball type flow meter.|$|E

25|$|Blockages {{are common}} with these resin filters {{and are usually}} fixed easily, {{but in this case}} the usual method of forcing the stuck resin out with {{compressed}} air did not succeed. The operators decided to blow the compressed air into the water and let the force of the water clear the resin. When they forced the resin out, a small amount of water forced its way past a stuck-open <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> and found its way into an instrument air line. This would eventually cause the feedwater pumps, condensate booster pumps, and condensate pumps to turn off around 4:00am, which would in turn cause a turbine trip.|$|E
25|$|When introduced, the block-mounted {{oil filter}} <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> was {{eliminated}} on the 4.0 (along with the 2.5 and 4.2s manufactured after September 1986) when AMC engineers standardized their oil filters. The pre-1987 engines had an oil filter adapter with 3/4 (cylinder block end) and 13/16 threads (which used a GM oil filter common to Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Cadillac V8 engines) while the 1987-06 engines were originally {{fitted with a}} 20mm metric thread filter (later revised in 1991 for the common 3/4 threaded Mopar and Ford V8 oil filter; the oil filter adapter was redesigned where the oil filter is positioned 90 degrees offset adjacent to the starter motor - a Ford V8 oil filter {{can be used in}} place of the short filter increasing oiling capacity).|$|E
25|$|A p–n {{junction}} diode {{is made of}} a crystal of semiconductor, usually silicon, but germanium and gallium arsenide are also used. Impurities are added to it to create a region on one side that contains negative charge carriers (electrons), called an n-type semiconductor, and a region {{on the other side}} that contains positive charge carriers (holes), called a p-type semiconductor. When the n-type and p-type materials are attached together, a momentary flow of electrons occur from the n to the p side resulting in a third region between the two where no charge carriers are present. This region is called the depletion region because there are no charge carriers (neither electrons nor holes) in it. The diode's terminals are attached to the n-type and p-type regions. The boundary between these two regions, called a p–n junction, is where the action of the diode takes place. When a sufficiently higher electrical potential is applied to the P side (the anode) than to the N side (the cathode), it allows electrons to flow through the depletion region from the N-type side to the P-type side. The junction does not allow the flow of electrons in the opposite direction when the potential is applied in reverse, creating, in a sense, an electrical <b>check</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|E

2500|$|When a user flushes a toilet, a [...] "toilet flapper valve" [...] (not to be {{confused}} with a type of <b>check</b> <b>valve)</b> opens and allows water from a reservoir tank to quickly enter the toilet bowl. This rapid influx from the tank causes the swirling water in the bowl to rapidly rise and fill the U-shaped inverted siphon tube mounted {{in the back of the}} toilet. This full siphon tube starts the toilet's siphonic action. The siphon action quickly (4–7 seconds) “pulls” nearly all of the water and waste in the bowl and the on-rushing tank water down the drain—it flushes. When most of the water has drained out of the bowl, the continuous column of water up and over the bottom of the upside-down U-shaped drain pipe (the siphon) is broken when air enters the siphon tube. The toilet then gives its characteristic gurgle as the siphonic action ceases and no more water flows out of the toilet. After flushing, the flapper valve in the water tank closes; water lines and valves connected to the water supply refill the toilet tank and bowl. Then the toilet is again ready for use.|$|E
2500|$|Discovery later {{rolled out}} from the VAB to Launch Complex 39A on 4 August 2009, in a slow drive {{on the top of}} the Crawler-transporter. The [...] rollout began at 02:07 EDT, and ended with the launch {{platform}} secured in place at about 13:50 EDT. The move took longer than expected due to adverse weather conditions, which included lightning warnings. The crawler also had to pause occasionally so mud could be removed from its treads and bearings. Technicians then quickly prepared the shuttle to host the crew’s countdown dress rehearsal known as the Terminal Countdown Demonstration Test (TCDT). Discovery’s seven astronauts flew to Kennedy on 5 August 2009 for the training activity which concludes later in the week with a complete practice countdown, minus liftoff, involving the crew and the launch team. Meanwhile, in an unprecedented operation, modifications were made to the left Solid rocket booster on the pad. The modifications involved replacement of a <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> filter assembly in the booster which was found to have broken. In a potentially delaying factor, in depth testing of the external tank with X-ray revealed voids in the foam which might have formed during the injection molding of the foam. This has also been decided as a suspect factor in the foam shedding during STS-127. The air in the voids could have expanded due to the high temperatures generated during ascent thus breaking the foam. The reviews considered a rollback as an option since the defect could not be set right in the pad. Later, the tank was cleared for launch as is without any additional inspections.|$|E
