The stress concentration in <b>cold</b> <b>formed</b> sections {{is due to the}} corner radii and notches present at inside corners of <b>cold</b> <b>formed</b> members. These investigations has been done by performing two-dimensional linear static analysis by modeling <b>cold</b> <b>formed</b> rectangular hollow section (CFRHS) with different notch shapes and sizes in Ansys software. Three different kinds of notches with two notch sizes i. e. n 1 =t/ 5 and n 2 = 2 t/ 5 have been modeled while the outer radius to thickness (r o/t) ratios of 3, 4 and 5 have been used. As a result of this work, stress concentration factors (K t) have been computed for all kinds of notches and results have been compared and reported in this paper. Whenever a CFRHS bends about its major principal axis, the web is the element that experiences a strain gradient from tension to compression.

50|$|Work {{hardening}} may {{be desirable}} or undesirable {{depending on the}} context. An example of undesirable work hardening is during machining when early passes of a cutter inadvertently work-harden the workpiece surface, causing damage to the cutter during the later passes. Certain alloys {{are more prone to}} this than others; superalloys such as Inconel require machining strategies that take it into account. An example of desirable work hardening is that which occurs in metalworking processes that intentionally induce plastic deformation to exact a shape change. These processes are known as cold working or <b>cold</b> <b>forming</b> processes. They are characterized by shaping the workpiece at a temperature below its recrystallization temperature, usually at ambient temperature. <b>Cold</b> <b>forming</b> techniques are usually classified into four major groups: squeezing, bending, drawing, and shearing. Applications include the heading of bolts and cap screws and the finishing of cold rolled steel. In <b>cold</b> <b>forming,</b> metal is formed at high speed and high pressure using tool steel or carbide dies.
