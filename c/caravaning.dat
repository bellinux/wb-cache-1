25|$|The 1911 {{election}} set {{a number}} of precedents that would characterize Hayden's later political campaigns. The first was his tradition of never mentioning his opponent's name in public. He also began a practice of <b>caravaning</b> around the state {{with other members of}} his party, a pattern that continued until war-time rationing of the 1940s ended the custom. He also kept a lookout for candidates with a potential to run against him, occasionally sending letters encouraging the rumored candidates to run. With good home service of his constituents, Hayden rarely faced a strong challenge for his office.|$|E

50|$|The {{improvements}} to the road network fostered the beginnings of <b>caravan</b> tourism on the North Coast. <b>Caravanning,</b> essentially another version of camping, developed {{as a result of}} increased car usage during the interwar period. The earliest versions of <b>caravans</b> were more like motorhomes; cars with bodies modified by their owners to include a rear compartment for sleeping and storage. Australian manufacturers of towed <b>caravans</b> had appeared by the late 1920s, some moving into the industry from building car bodies. Self-built <b>caravans</b> were also popular, with manuals published on their construction and fittings. By 1937, Australian enthusiasts had their own journal and motoring supplements in newspapers were devoting column space to <b>caravans.</b> <b>Caravans</b> were reported alongside tents at Maroochy seaside camping grounds by the end of 1937, with the region's earliest private <b>caravan</b> accommodation, Tooway Park near Caloundra, under construction in the same period. By 1939, 169 <b>caravans</b> were registered in Queensland.|$|R
5000|$|The {{increasing}} number of <b>caravan</b> users in turn stimulated development of <b>caravan</b> parks. Private developers {{were the first to}} offer <b>caravan</b> parks from the late 1930s with modern facilities and structured layout. However, in the early 1950s, relatively few sites in Queensland offered the necessary infrastructure to accommodate <b>caravanning</b> needs. Calls for improvements to sites and facilities accompanied increased <b>caravan</b> usage. Advocates looked to the United States and the United Kingdom for examples of best practice in <b>caravan</b> parks. <b>Caravanning</b> guides and journals offered suggestions for layout and features. The publication Modern <b>Caravan</b> Parks offered advice to local authorities and others interested in establishing <b>caravan</b> parks. Suggestions included a more formal arrangement of space than camping required, characterised by grid or circular layouts and landscaped grounds. Features of <b>caravan</b> parks became a location near a main road, a prominent entrance, recreation room, brick amenities block, levelled concrete slabs, landscaping, hose connections, hot showers and electricity. They also had on-site caretakers/proprietors. Many parks offered on-site vans for rental. [...] "Tradespeople" [...] called to deliver essentials like bread and milk. A common characteristic of public (and private) camping grounds and <b>caravan</b> parks has been the continual updating of their facilities.|$|R
