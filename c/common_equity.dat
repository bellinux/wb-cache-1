25|$|On July 10, 2008, Dow {{agreed to}} {{purchase}} {{all of the}} <b>common</b> <b>equity</b> interest of Rohm and Haas Co. for $15.4 billion, which equated to $78 per share. The buyout was to be financed with equity investments of $3 billion by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and $1 billion by the Kuwait Investment Authority. The purpose of the deal was to move Dow Chemical further into specialty chemicals, which offer higher profit margins than the commodities market and {{are more difficult to}} enter for the competition. The purchase has been criticized by many on Wall Street who believe Dow Chemical overpaid (about a 75 percent premium on the previous day's market capital) to acquire the company; however, the high bid was needed to ward off competing bids from BASF. The transaction to purchase the outstanding interest of Rohm and Haas closed on April 1, 2009.|$|E

2500|$|In larger transactions, {{sometimes}} {{all or part}} of these two debt types is replaced by high yield bonds. Depending {{on the size of the}} acquisition, debt as well as equity can be provided by more than one party. In larger transactions, debt is often syndicated, meaning that the bank who arranges the credit sells {{all or part of}} the debt in pieces to other banks in an attempt to diversify and hence reduce its risk. Another form of debt that is used in LBOs are seller notes (or vendor loans) in which the seller effectively uses parts of the proceeds of the sale to grant a loan to the purchaser. Such seller notes are often employed in management buyouts or in situations with very restrictive bank financing environments. Note that in close to all cases of LBOs, the only collateralization available for the debt are the assets and cash flows of the company. The financial sponsor can treat their investment as <b>common</b> <b>equity</b> or preferred equity among other types of securities. [...] Preferred equity can pay a dividend and has payment preferences to <b>common</b> <b>equity.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Mezzanine capital {{refers to}} subordinated debt or {{preferred}} equity securities that often represent the most junior {{portion of a}} company's capital structure that is senior to the company's <b>common</b> <b>equity.</b> [...] This form of financing is often used by private equity investors {{to reduce the amount}} of equity capital required to finance a leveraged buyout or major expansion. [...] Mezzanine capital, which is often used by smaller companies that are unable to access the high yield market, allows such companies to borrow additional capital beyond the levels that traditional lenders are willing to provide through bank loans. [...] In compensation for the increased risk, mezzanine debt holders require a higher return for their investment than secured or other more senior lenders. Mezzanine securities are often structured with a current income coupon.|$|E

60|$|To {{argue against}} the {{lawfulness}} {{of this would}} be to cry down <b>common</b> <b>equity</b> as well as charity: for as it is kind that my neighbour should relieve me if I fall into distress or decay, so it is but equal he should do so if I agreed to have done the same for him; and if God Almighty has commanded us to relieve and help one another in distress, surely it must be commendable to bind ourselves by agreement to obey that command; nay, {{it seems to be a}} project that we are led to by the divine rule, and has such a latitude in it that for aught I know, as I said, all the disasters in the world might be prevented by it, and mankind be secured from all the miseries, indigences, and distresses that happen in the world.

60|$|Sect. 8. And thus, in {{the state}} of nature, one man comes by a power over another; but yet no {{absolute}} or arbitrary power, to use a criminal, when he has got him in his hands, according to the passionate heats, or boundless extravagancy of his own will; but only to retribute to him, so far as calm reason and conscience dictate, what is proportionate to his transgression, which is so much as may serve for reparation and restraint: for these two are the only reasons, why one man may lawfully do harm to another, which is that we call punishment. In transgressing the law of nature, the offender declares himself to live by another rule than that of reason and <b>common</b> <b>equity,</b> which is that measure God has set to the actions of men, for their mutual security; and so he becomes dangerous to mankind, the tye, which is to secure them from injury and violence, being slighted and broken by him. Which being a trespass against the whole species, and the peace and safety of it, provided for by the law of nature, every man upon this score, by the right he hath to preserve mankind in general, may restrain, or where it is necessary, destroy things noxious to them, and so may bring such evil on any one, who hath transgressed that law, as may make him repent the doing of it, and thereby deter him, and by his example others, from doing the like mischief. And in the case, and upon this ground, EVERY MAN HATH A RIGHT TO PUNISH THE OFFENDER, AND BE EXECUTIONER OF THE LAW OF NATURE.|$|E
6000|$|The impudence of {{this remark}} exceeds all that went before. First; the House of Commons in Ireland, which {{represents}} the whole people of the kingdom; and secondly the Privy-council, addressed His Majesty against these halfpence. What could be done more to express the universal sense and opinion of the nation? If his copper were diamonds, and the kingdom were entirely against it, would not that be sufficient to reject it? Must a committee of the House of Commons, and our whole Privy-council go over to argue pro and con with Mr. Wood? To what end did the King give his patent for coining of halfpence in Ireland? Was it not, because it was represented to his sacred Majesty, that such a coinage would be of advantage to the good of this kingdom, and of all his subjects here? It is to the patentee's peril if his representation be false, and the execution of his patent be fraudulent and corrupt. Is he so wicked and foolish to think that his patent was given him to ruin {{a million and a}} half of people, that he might be a gainer of three or four score thousand pounds to himself? Before he was at the charge of passing a patent, much more of raking up so much filthy dross, and stamping it with His Majesty's [...] "image and superscription," [...] should he not first in common sense, in <b>common</b> <b>equity,</b> and common manners, have consulted the principal party concerned; that is to say, the people of the kingdom, the House of Lords or Commons, or the Privy-council? If any foreigner should ask us, [...] "whose image and superscription" [...] there is in Wood's coin, we should be ashamed to tell him, it was Caesar's. In that great want of copper halfpence, which he alleges we were, our city set up our Caesar's statue[11] in excellent copper, at an expense that is equal in value to thirty thousand pounds of his coin: And we will not receive his image in worse metal.|$|E

However, subordinated debenture increases the probability of costly failure.

In such an event, the debt obligation is automatically converted to the bank’s <b>common</b> <b>equities.</b> We present closed-form solutions for the valuation of liabilities, deposit insurance and the value of bankruptcy costs of a bank that includes DES or subordinated debt in its capital structure.

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{claims about the}} diversification benefits of real estate. In particular, does real estate investment in a mixed asset portfolio provide protection when other asset classes are performing badly? Conventional portfolio strategy models utilising covariance statistics {{may result in a}} misallocation of capital if correlation structures between assets differ across the distribution of returns. Models of asymmetric dependence using the copula function, drawn from the recent finance literature are used to examine the relationships between real estate and equity at different points in their joint return distributions. For both UK and Global markets, real estate securities and <b>common</b> <b>equities</b> are shown to exhibit strong tail dependence [...] particularly in the negative tail. This suggests that real estate securities offer, at best, limited diversification protection when it is needed most [...] when other asset markets are falling. This has implications for allocation strategies in mixed asset portfolios...|$|R
