30|$|Commonly, {{the reasons}} for {{capacity}} fade of lithium-ion battery anode were as follows [33 – 35]: (1) the pulverization, over-charge, and discharge in electrode materials, (2) the formation of SEI films in the cycle process on the electrode surface, (3) the decomposition of electrolyte solvent during the discharge process, (4) the irreversible side reaction due to lithium ion inability to remove all, and (5) the slurry fall off copper foil follow the <b>charge-discharge</b> <b>cycles.</b> Here, the preparation condition of CuO anode electrode was identical except the PVDF, so the slurry fell off copper foil follow the <b>charge-discharge</b> <b>cycles</b> may work.|$|R
40|$|As {{potential}} {{high capacity}} anode materials for lithium ion batteries, the Sn and Ni-Sn alloy coatings {{have been investigated}} by many electrochemical researchers. However, their mechanical properties have not been extensively studied, {{despite the fact that}} such anode films may fail mechanically during service. Thus, in this study nanoindentation and nanowear tests have been performed. Nanoindentation tests reveal that the ability to carry the load dramatically reduces in the Sn coating after one <b>charge-discharge</b> <b>cycle</b> which makes the plastic strain accumulation in the copper substrate play a greater contribution to crack formation and propagation in repeated charge-discharge cycling. Upon the nanoindentation analysis, it also shows that the pores formed by lithiation/delithiation can easily collapse at low loads. Furthermore, nanowear tests explore that the damage resistance of the Sn-Ni alloy film significantly improves after one <b>charge-discharge</b> <b>cycle</b> but it decreases in the Sn film after the same charge-discharge cycle; this explains why the degradation rate of the Ni-Sn alloy is slow after the first <b>charge-discharge</b> <b>cycle</b> and why the high capacity is maintained in further cycling.

This new phenomenon has been investigated through EIS measurements {{as a function of}} temperature. It has found that the high frequency semicircle and the middle to high frequency semicircle begin to overlap each other above 20 degrees C, which indicates that the high frequency compressed semicircle commonly obtained at room temperature in the literature may consist of two semicircles. This signifies that the effects of the electronic and ionic transport properties of lithium intercalation materials clearly appear as separate features in the EIS spectra at low temperatures. A new equivalent circuit that includes elements related to the electronic and ionic transport, in addition to the charge transfer process, is proposed to simulate the experimental EIS data.
