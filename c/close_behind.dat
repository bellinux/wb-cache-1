Here dumps were formed of all surplus equipment, before the brigades and divisions moved up <b>close</b> <b>behind</b> the XXI Corps infantry divisions, near the Mediterranean coast.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} pit stops, the Mercedes drivers had {{to manage their}} tyres in order to cover from a {{possible}} attack by Ferrari, who had an extra set of fresh tyres saved from qualifying. Rosberg however complained over the radio about Hamilton {{in front of him}} driving too slow, which caused him to back into the charging Ferraris. He was unable to risk driving too <b>close</b> <b>behind</b> Hamilton, because dispersed air {{from the back of the}} car was accelerating tyre degradation. Hamilton was therefore asked by the team to pick up the pace.|$|E

5|$|Stirling led {{two units}} of Colonel John Haslet's 1st Delaware Regiment under the {{immediate}} command of Major Thomas Macdonough, and Colonel William Smallwood's 1st Maryland Infantry under the immediate command of Major Mordecai Gist; both Haslet and Smallwood were on courts-martial duty in Manhattan. Following <b>close</b> <b>behind</b> was Parson's Connecticut regiment with 251 men. Stirling led this combined force to reinforce Parsons and Atlee {{and stop the}} British advance. Stirling had a total of 1,600 troops at his command.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech wide {{receiver}} Danny Coale's 143receiving yards were a career-high {{and set a}} championship-game record. Many of those receiving yards came on third down and were a reason why Tech converted 13 of its 17third-down opportunities, setting another championship-game record. Florida State's leading receiver was {{wide receiver}} Taiwan Easterling, who had sixcatches for 79yards. <b>Close</b> <b>behind</b> was wide receiver Willie Haulstead, who had three receptions for 73yards. All of Haulstead's receptions came in the first half, setting a record for receiving yards in an ACC Championship Game half.|$|E

5|$|After recovering, {{he joined}} the Kimberley Mounted Corps and guided two {{officers}} from Lichtenburg to Klerksdorp, where they persuaded the Boers to surrender by bluffing that a strong British force was following <b>close</b> <b>behind.</b> The Boers soon retook the town and Guest was captured. He was sent with other prisoners to Pietersburg to be executed {{but he managed to}} escape and travelled to Warmbaths. After satisfying the authorities that he had actually been taken prisoner and had not surrendered voluntarily, he returned to his depot at Kimberley. His unit had been disbanded and he was discharged.|$|E
5|$|In the firstpractice session, Hill was fastest {{with a time}} of 1:21.664, twothousands of {{a second}} ahead of {{teammate}} Coulthard. Schumacher was third, with the Ferrari cars of Jean Alesi and Gerhard Berger, who had been the leading two for most session, <b>close</b> <b>behind.</b> Blundell in the McLaren was sixth, with teammate Häkkinen finishing the session in 14th position, the Finnish driver complaining of steering problems with the car. The two Ferrari drivers used different pedal layouts in the 412T2 chassis: Berger's car was equipped with two pedals and a hand-operated clutch, whereas Alesi preferred the traditional three-pedal system.|$|E
5|$|Ottawa {{moved into}} their new arena, simply dubbed The Arena, with seating for 4,500 and {{standing}} room for 2,500. With the free agent signings {{and the new}} arena, Ottawa started selling season-tickets, the first of their kind, $3.75 for five games, eventually selling 2,400. The capacity was topped with a crowd of 7,100 in the home opener, attending {{a game against the}} Wanderers on January 11, which Ottawa won 12–2. However, Ottawa started the season with two losses out of three games and ended in second place behind the Wanderers again. Walsh tied for the scoring lead with 28 goals in 9 games (including 7 in one match), while Phillips was <b>close</b> <b>behind</b> at 26 goals in 10 games.|$|E

5|$|The Catholic Church, whose {{traditional}} membership {{was most}} affected by the changes in housing, {{was the first to}} react to this situation, creating 76 new parishes between 1845 and 1960 in the west of the country alone. The Baptist and Episcopalian churches followed <b>close</b> <b>behind,</b> particularly in the new towns. Within the Church of Scotland, the closeness of congregation and clergy was expressed in the domestic plainness of 1950s dual-use hall churches, as at Reiach's Kildrum Parish Church, Cumbernauld (completed 1962), a steel framed building, clad in timber and brick with a flat roof. Of 129 buildings erected by the Church of Scotland between 1948 and 1959, 108 were on this basic pattern.|$|E
5|$|The books also aroused controversies in the {{literary}} and publishing worlds. From 1997 to 1998, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone won almost all the UK awards judged by children, {{but none of the}} children's book awards judged by adults, and Sandra Beckett suggested the reason was intellectual snobbery towards books that were popular among children. In 1999, the winner of the Whitbread Book of the Year award children's division was entered {{for the first time on}} the shortlist for the main award, and one judge threatened to resign if Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was declared the overall winner; it finished second, very <b>close</b> <b>behind</b> the winner of the poetry prize, Seamus Heaney's translation of the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf.|$|E
5|$|With the 11th Light Armoured Motor Battery and 1st Light Car Patrol attached, the 4th Cavalry Division watered at the 'Auja River {{before moving}} to the {{south-east}} of Jlil, <b>close</b> <b>behind</b> the infantry and the front line. From here, a divisional pioneer party reached the front line at 07:00 on 19 September to cut a gap and flag a path through the Ottoman wire. By 08:40 permission was given by the 7th (Meerut) Division, which had attacked the western sector of the Tabsor defences, for the 4th Cavalry Division, accompanied by three horse artillery batteries which had rejoined the division after taking part in the bombardment and creeping barrage {{at the beginning of the}} Battle of Sharon, to pass through the gap in the Ottoman front line defences created by their attacks.|$|E

5|$|After the assault, the 33rd Division {{pursued the}} {{retreating}} German forces, while the 38th stayed <b>close</b> <b>behind</b> {{ready to take}} over the advance or assault strongly-held German positions as needed. On 9 October, Clary was liberated and the next day the divisional artillery was firing in support of the 33rd which had made contact with German forces. Over the next few days, the 33rd Division pursued the Germans to the River Selle and launched a bloody assault on the defended eastern bank during the opening stages of the Battle of the Selle. While a bridgehead was secured, it was abandoned due to losses and the 38th Division was moved forward. On the night of 13/14 October, the division took over the line near Troisvilles and Bertry. Over the next six days, the division prepared itself: conducting reconnaissance, constructing bridges and moving up heavy artillery. During these preparations, the Germans bombarded elements of the division's artillery with gas shells.|$|E
5|$|Although {{rain fell}} on Saturday morning, the track had dried by {{the start of}} the final free {{practice}} session. Lewis Hamilton again set the fastest time with 1:25.624, less than two-tenths of a second in front of teammate Rosberg, with Sebastian Vettel in third position <b>close</b> <b>behind.</b> The fastest times had been set on the super-soft tyre compound. However, Mercedes's advantage over Ferrari proved more significant, up to seven-tenths of a second on the harder soft compound, the tyre most likely {{to be used in the}} race. Toro Rosso confirmed their good pace for the weekend with fourth and sixth place for Carlos Sainz and Max Verstappen respectively, being about half a second quicker than their sister team, Red Bull Racing. A major incident occurred just seconds after the beginning of the practice session, when Rio Haryanto and Romain Grosjean collided in the pit lane. Both cars needed to equip new front wings and Haas also changed the floor on Grosjean's car. Haryanto was later issued a three-place grid penalty for the incident, as well as two penalty points added to his licence.|$|E
5|$|Around an {{hour after}} the start of the race, three {{children}} were struck by car driven by one of the race officials on a side road from Quarter Bridge Road, near the finish line. None sustained serious injuries; two of them had cuts dressed, while the third rushed back to watching the racing. Another, more serious, accident occurred on the Snaefell Mountain Railway, which had been transporting people up the mountain to watch the racing. A tramcar that had been descending the railway had broken down, and a second car had stopped <b>close</b> <b>behind</b> it. A third tram, on rounding the bend above them, was unable to stop in time and collided into the rearmost car, which was then propelled into {{the car in front of}} it. Minor injuries were sustained by some of the passengers, though none were serious.|$|E
