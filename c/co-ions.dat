40|$|ABSTRACT: Using {{molecular}} dynamics simulations, {{we show that}} charge storage in subnanometer pores follows a distinct voltage-dependent behavior. Specifically, at lower voltages, charge storage is achieved by swapping <b>co-ions</b> in the pore with counterions in the bulk electrolyte. As voltage increases, further charge storage is due mainly to the removal of <b>co-ions</b> from the pore, leading to a capacitance increase. The capacitance eventually reaches a maximum when all <b>co-ions</b> are expelled from the pore. At even higher electrode voltages, additional charge storage is realized by counterion insertion into the pore, accompanied by a reduction of capacitance.
