50|$|In cryptography, a {{certificate}} authority or <b>certification</b> <b>authority</b> (<b>CA)</b> is an entity that issues digital certificates. A digital certificate certifies {{the ownership of}} a public key by the named subject of the certificate.

A CA acts as a trusted third party—trusted both by the subject (owner) of the certificate and by the party relying upon the certificate.
