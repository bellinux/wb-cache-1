The most common corticos-teroid-related AEs {{are not necessarily}} the most costly. The present study aimed to examine corticosteroid-related AE rates and identify the associated cost consequences in patients with SLE from the perspective of rheumatologists treating SLE in the United States (US). A modified Delphi process and RAND Appropriateness Method was used to estimate corti-costeroid-related AEs and costs based on data from SLE-treating US rheumatologists and estimates from alternative sources. The panel (n 10) participated in two web-based question-naires, <b>covering</b> <b>disease</b> severity, corticosteroid use, corticosteroid-related AEs, and resource utilization associated with treatment of the AEs. Eight members of the panel then participated in a guided discussion by interactive teleconference, in which the costs associated with specific corticosteroid-related AEs were also discussed. Consensus was achieved in the teleconference when a single response category (consensus values from 1 to 4 [4 strongly agree, 1 strongly disagree]) accounted for 80 % of responses. Thirteen consensus statements were developed following two Delphi rounds. Costs were estimated for eight corticosteroid-associated AE...|$|E
40|$|Animal {{health plans}} are now widely {{accepted}} as a tool that can provide a structured approach to health promotion and positive welfare. This requires a partnership between farmer and veterinary advisor {{as well as a}} good knowledge of organic farming practice by animal health professionals. This paper describes an electronic compendium of information relevant to animal health and welfare in organic farming, the main aim of which is to provide resource material and a training tool for those working with organic livestock farmers. The approach involved an extensive and detailed literature search, synthesis to provide advisory material {{and the development of a}} website. The compendium is divided into species specific sub-sections <b>covering</b> <b>Disease</b> Management, Veterinary Management and Health and Welfare and includes over 2500 references and web-site links. The compendium covers 45 cattle, 44 sheep, 32 poultry and 27 pig diseases and conditions as well as extensive sections pertaining to each species’ behavioural requirements. Throughout there are links to relevant elements of organic farming legislation. By providing information on new research and practical solutions to treating and avoiding disease it is expected that the compendium will contribute to improved knowledge amongst farmers, veterinarians and advisors and thereby enabling the development of animal health plans that promote high standards of animal health and welfare in organic farming. ...|$|E

40|$|Cladobotryum spp. are {{responsible}} for cobweb disease of mushrooms. In two commercial and one experimental mushroom-growing room, Cladobotryum conidia were released into the air in direct response to physical disturbance of disease colonies during either crop watering or treatment by covering with salt to 10 mm. Conidia were detected using a Burkard spore trap or agar-based trap plates. A maximum concentration of ∼ 25, 000 conidia m− 3 was recorded in a small (75 -m 3) experimental growing room in the hour following the salting of 16 cobweb patches (0. 55 m 2). Concentrations of 100 and 40 conidia m− 3 were recorded in the two larger commercial growing rooms in the hour following the salting of 18 and 11 patches of cobweb (diameter, approximately 50 to 200 mm), respectively. In controlled experiments, disturbed conidia were dispersed rapidly throughout a small growing room, with 91 to 97 % of conidia settling out within 15 min. Eighty-five percent of conidia settled out within a 0. 5 -m radius when air-conditioning fans were switched off, consistent with airborne spore dispersal. Alternative methods for treating diseased areas to minimize conidial release and distribution were investigated and included <b>covering</b> <b>disease</b> colonies with damp paper tissue prior to salt application (tissue salting) and holding a dust extractor above disease colonies during salt application. Both methods resulted in no detectable airborne conidia, but the tissue paper salting technique was more convenient. Prevention of airborne conidial release and distribution is essential to avoid mushroom spotting symptoms, secondary colonies, and early crop termination...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{impact of}} cancer on patients' lives can be {{measured}} using self-reported questionnaires, known as Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) measures. HRQOL {{is defined as a}} multi-dimensional construct <b>covering</b> <b>disease</b> and treatment-related symptoms, physical, psychological, and social functioning. The EORTC Quality of Life Group (QLG) was created in 1984 with the mission to develop measures of HRQOL and to promote and coordinate clinical studies concerning {{the quality of life of}} cancer patients. The EORTC Quality of Life Department (QL Department) was founded in 1993 with the support of an EU grant to provide administrative, practical and scientific support to co-operative groups conducting clinical trials with HRQOL outcomes. We are proud to report significant scientific achievements that have made us international leaders in HRQOL research and have led to real changes to cancer patient treatments. We developed a modular system for HRQOL measurement consisting of the EORTC QLQ-C 30, a core cancer quality of life questionnaire and supplementary questionnaire modules. The EORTC-QLQ-C 30 has been one of the most widely used cancer questionnaires in randomized trials in oncology as demonstrated by systematic reviews. To date, the EORTC QLQ-C 30 has been translated and linguistically validated into more than 60 languages. HRQOL outcome measures have been an integral part of EORTC clinical trials for the last 30 years. We present examples of significant, practice-changing clinical trials evaluating HRQOL in several cancer sites, such as brain tumors, breast and ovarian cancers, and malignant melanoma. In a series of systematic reviews, we examined the quality of reporting HRQOL in international cancer clinical trials, and the impact of the results on oncology practice that led to a recommendation to improve CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) with regard to reporting of HRQOL. The QLG is an international leader in methodological research in the measurement of HRQOL in oncology and pursues research in several key areas, such as cross-cultural differences between populations in HRQOL assessment, Computer-Adaptive Testing, electronic administration of EORTC QLQ-C 30, and summary scores for EORTC QLQ-C 30. In summary, the QLG and QL Department have been international leaders in the field. Our questionnaires have brought HRQOL assessment to the fore in many international trials that have changed oncology practice and brought the patient's perspective into cancer research...|$|E

The project aims to support and evaluate ongoing political and administrative efforts to implement nationwide guidelines for maintaining metabolic control in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T 2 D) patients to prevent diabetic complications and improve quality of life. The DD 2 is designed as a prospective cohort study (collection of epidemiological data) supplemented by randomized clinical intervention trials (on physical exercise and individualized pharmacological treatment) and the establishment of a biobank comprised of material from a large number of newly diagnosed T 2 D patients. Inclusion of the majority of newly diagnosed T 2 D patients as they are diagnosed at their general practitioner or diabetes hospital outpatient clinics and entered into the DD 2 cohort will establish a nationwide database comprising a large number of future incident cases of T 2 D in Denmark. These cases will form the project cohort of the DD 2. Within the first 6 months of diagnosis, all patients will be invited to contribute to a biobank of DNA, plasma, urine, and tissue sampling. The DNA biobank will enable future studies of the effect of pharmacological treatment and outcome in subsets of patients with specific genetic risk profiles <b>covering</b> <b>disease</b> etiology and specific drug kinetics and metabolism. We will also perform two clinical intervention trials examining: the effectiveness of physical exercise on diabetes-related outcomes and the impact of trial outcomes on individualized pharmacological treatment. Moreover, the DD 2 will serve as a platform for testing and developing new antidiabetic drugs. All together, we expect this study to contribute to substantially improved diabetes care in T 2 D patients locally and abroad.

40|$|Inherited retinal {{degeneration}} (RD) damages light-sensing photoreceptors, resulting in loss of vision. RD is an umbrella term <b>covering</b> <b>diseases</b> that range in severity from Leber hereditary amaurosis (LCA), in which vision is severely affected from birth, to milder forms of RP that can leave central vision intact until old age, and macular degen-eration, which affects central vision only. RD represents {{the most common}} cause of visual dysfunction in people of working age in developed economies. Therefore, these condi-tions have significant adverse effects on patient quality of life and on the broader economy. Genetic linkage studies, functional genomics, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have provided opportunities to elucidate the pathways of retinal development and homeostasis, in addition to the molecular pathogenesis of disease. A notable feature of inherited retinopathies is their genetic heterogeneity; multiple mutations in any one of more than 200 genes can cause RD. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a form of RD that results from rod photoreceptor defects, affects approximately 1 in 3, 000 adults and can result from mutations in any one of more than 70 genes [1 - 3] (RetNet). Regardless of the genetic mutation underlying individual forms of RD, however, photoreceptor cell death occurs gradually via apoptosis. Gene therapies for some forms of RD have been inves-tigated; gene replacement therapies for diverse recessive retinopathies have shown promise in clinical trials [1, 3 - 11]. With the exception of optogenetic-based gene therapies [1, 12], gene therapy requires significant photoreceptor survival and therefore may not represent an optimal therapeutic strategy for advanced disease. Furthermore, gene therapies targeted t...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Postulated {{epidemiological}} {{associations are}} subject to several biases. We evaluated whether the Chinese literature on human genome epidemiology may offer insights on the operation of selective reporting and language biases. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We targeted 13 gene-disease associations, each already assessed by meta-analyses, including at least 15 non-Chinese studies. We searched the Chinese Journal Full-Text Database for additional Chinese studies on the same topics. We identified 161 Chinese studies on 12 of these gene-disease associations; only 20 were PubMed-indexed (seven English full-text). Many studies (14 - 35 per topic) were available for six topics, <b>covering</b> <b>diseases</b> common in China. With one exception, the first Chinese study appeared with a time lag (2 - 21 y) after the first non-Chinese study on the topic. Chinese studies showed significantly more prominent genetic effects than non-Chinese studies, and 48 % were statistically significant per se, despite their smaller sample size (median sample size 146 versus 268, p < 0. 001). The largest genetic effects were often seen in PubMed-indexed Chinese studies (65 % statistically significant per se). Non-Chinese studies of Asian-descent populations (27 % significant per se) also tended to show somewhat more prominent genetic effects than studies of non-Asian descent (17 % significant per se). CONCLUSION: Our data provide evidence for the interplay of selective reporting and language biases in human genome epidemiology.

40|$|Background Computerized {{decision}} support systems (CDSSs) are increasingly {{used to improve}} quality of care. There is evidence for moderate to large effects from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but evidence on their effectiveness when implemented at a national level is lacking. In the Netherlands, the Dutch College of General Practitioners (NHG) initiated their successful guideline program already 30 years ago. NHGDoc, a CDSS based on these NHG guidelines, <b>covering</b> multiple <b>disease</b> areas for general practice, was developed in 2006 with the aim to improve quality of primary care. In this paper, a protocol is presented to evaluate the uptake and effects of NHGDoc. Methods A cluster RCT will be conducted among 120 general practices in the Netherlands. Eligible general practices will be randomized to receive either the regular NHGDoc {{decision support}} modules (control arm) or the regular modules plus an additional module on heart failure (intervention arm). The heart failure module consists of patient-specific alerts concerning the treatment of patients with heart failure. The effect evaluation will focus on performance indicators (e. g., prescription behavior) {{as well as on}} patient outcomes (e. g., hospital admissions) relevant in the domain of heart failure. Additionally, a process evaluation will be conducted to gain insight into the barriers and facilitators that affect the uptake and impact of NHGDoc. Discussion Results of this study will provide insight in the uptake and impact of a multiple-domain covering CDSS for primary care implemented by a national guideline organization {{to improve the quality of}} primary care.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite the {{widespread}} availability of computerized decision support systems (CDSSs) in various healthcare settings, evidence on their uptake and effectiveness is still limited. Most barrier studies focus on CDSSs that {{are aimed at}} {{a limited number of}} decision points within selected small-scale academic settings. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the perceived barriers to using large-scale implemented CDSSs <b>covering</b> multiple <b>disease</b> areas in primary care. METHODS: Three focus group sessions were conducted in which 24 primary care practitioners (PCPs) participated (general practitioners, general practitioners in training and practice nurses), varying from 7 to 9 per session. In each focus group, barriers to using CDSSs were discussed using a semi-structured literature-based topic list. Focus group discussions were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim. Two researchers independently performed thematic content analysis using the software program Atlas. ti 7. 0. RESULTS: Three groups of barriers emerged, related to 1) the users' knowledge of the system, 2) the users' evaluation of features of the system (source and content, format/lay out, and functionality), and 3) the interaction of the system with external factors (patient-related and environmental factors). Commonly perceived barriers were insufficient knowledge of the CDSS, irrelevant alerts, too high intensity of alerts, a lack of flexibility and learning capacity of the CDSS, a negative effect on patient communication, and the additional time and work it requires to use the CDSS. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple types of barriers may hinder the use of large-scale implemented CDSSs <b>covering</b> multiple <b>disease</b> areas in primary care. Lack of knowledge of the system is an important barrier, emphasizing the importance of a proper introduction of the system to the target group. Furthermore, barriers related to a lack of integration into daily practice seem to be of primary concern, suggesting that increasing the system's flexibility and learning capacity in order to be able to adapt the decision support to meet the varying needs of different users should be the main target of CDSS interventions...|$|R

40|$|Research and {{development}} (R&D) <b>covering</b> <b>diseases</b> that disproportionately affect developing nations is grossly inadequate. In particular {{it has been}} noted {{over a long period}} that governments of countries with high tuberculosis (TB) disease burden under invest in TB R&D, despite having 40 % of the world’s notified TB cases. For instance, South Africa’s (SA) annual expenditure on TB R&D, of US$ 1, 2 million in 2012, is insignificant relative to its disease burden, of 1 003 per 100, 000 population. New tools are required to stop TB; these tools require R&D investment. However a recent report has noted {{that for the first time}} in eight years, global spending on TB R&D decreased in 2012 compared with the previous year. This drop in R&D investment threatens to undermine the possibility of any future insights from TB research. The important question remains: how can public investment in TB R&D be stimulated or incentivised, especially within those countries of high prevalence and sizeable R&D budgets (such as India, SA, China and Russia) ? In an attempt to answer such a question, this research followed a quantitative, case study methodology based on secondary data analysis of information from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the SA National Strategic Plan (NSP) 2012 - 2016, looking at the costs associated with TB treatment in SA and identified areas of potential savings as a consequence of well directed R&D. For additional information on external funding and TB R&D investment, the study used the Organisation for Economic and Development (OECD) and Treatment Action Group (TAG) data. A return on investment estimation method for suitable R&D projects was then used to compute the optimal TB R&D investment range. The results of the research show that there are higher returns on the optimization of TB drug regimens versus new drug development. The argument proposed by this research is that further TB R&D expenditure can be justified from a purely economic return on investment consideration, considering that expenditure of public funds on TB treatment is high and significant savings can be made through improvements to the current drug regimen optimisation. This report will help policy makers in increasing public health R&D expenditure from present levels to those targets set by the World Health Organisation’s Consultative Expert Working Group (CEWG) and others. This return on investment will only be realised if public-funded R&D is focussed more directly on public health priorities.

Understanding their comparative importance, and adequately accounting for health loss from morbidity or disability, as well as mortality, requires a common met-ric such as the disability-adjusted life-year (DALY), a com-bination of years of life lost prematurely (YLL) and years lived with disability (YLD). DALYs have been widely used in Global Burden of Disease (GBD) studies to measure health loss in populations in a comparable fashion, across time, causes, geography and risk factors...|$|R

This article describes a case study wherein the Health Council of the Netherlands involved patient groups in an advisory process with a predefined focus: setting a research agenda for medical products development. A four-phase approach was developed to stimulate needs-articulation concerning future medical products for {{a broad range of}} patient groups <b>covering</b> 15 <b>disease</b> domains. 119 (expert) patients and 92 non-patient representatives were consulted using interviews and focus groups. In a facilitated way, patients appeared capable and willing to provide input useful for an advisory process. A broad range of medical products was defined serving different purposes. This study showed two dilemmas: first, finding a balance between a predefined focus and being sufficiently broad to enable patients and patient representatives to contribute, and second, finding a balance between relevance for many patients groups and saturation of data for a lower number of patient groups. By taking the context of patients' daily life as starting point patient groups provided new insights. The predefined focus was sometimes perceived as constraining. The GR considered the articulated needs constructive and incorporated patients' input in their advice to the Minister of Health. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd...|$|R
