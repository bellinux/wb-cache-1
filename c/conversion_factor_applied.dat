40|$|In {{the latter}} half of 2005, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) {{published}} a Proposed Rule (40 CFR Part 197) for establishing a dose rate standard for limiting radionuclide releases from the proposed Yucca Mountain high-level radioactive waste repository during the time period from 10 {sup 4 } to 10 {sup 6 } years after closure. The proposed standard was based on the difference in the estimated total dose rate from natural background in the Amargosa Valley and the ''average annual background radiation'' for the State of Colorado. As defined by the USEPA, ''natural background radiation consists of external exposures from cosmic and terrestrial sources, and internal exposures from indoor exposures to naturally-occurring radon''. On the basis of its assessments, the USEPA estimated that the difference in the dose rate in the two identified areas was 3. 5 mSv y{sup - 1 }. The purpose of this review was to provide an independent evaluation and review of this estimate. One of the first observations was that, because site-specific dose rate measurements for the Amargosa Valley ''were not available'', the dose rates for various sources of natural background in that area, used by the USEPA in its assessment, were based on modifications of the average values for the State of Nevada. A second observation was that the <b>conversion</b> <b>factor</b> <b>applied</b> in estimating the dose rates due to exposures to indoor radon and its decay products was a factor of 2 higher than the currently accepted value. Further review revealed that site-specific data for many natural background sources in the Amargosa Valley were available. One particularly important observation was that about 91 % of the residents of that area live in mobile homes which, due to their construction and design, have indoor radon concentrations comparable to, or less than, those outdoors. For that reason, alone, the USEPA estimate of the average dose rate for residents of the Amargosa Valley, due to indoor radon, was not valid. For purposes of the comparisons in this paper, site-specific dose rates were estimated for all major natural background sources of exposure to residents of the Amargosa Valley, and those in Leadville, CO. The latter community was selected for comparison because of its altitude (3, 200 m) and accompanying high cosmic radiation dose rate, and the fact the size of its population is comparable to that of Amargosa Valley. For completeness, similar comparisons of the estimated dose rate in the Amargosa Valley to those for residents of Leadville, CO, the States of Colorado and Nevada. The estimated dose rates in Leadville, the State of Colorado, and the State of Nevada, were higher than those in the Amargosa Valley by 4. 09, 2. 62, and 1. 01 mSv y{sup - 1 }, respectively. Associated uncertainties were highest for the estimated dose rates due to exposures to radon and its decay products. The overall uncertainty in the dose estimates, including the errors in the radon dose coefficient, could be as high as 142 %...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{is based}} on the data {{obtained}} from expeditions to Kurday, Kazakhstan in 2006 performed by Joint Norwegian- Kazakhstan – Kyrgyzstan- Tajikistan project in collaboration with the NATRO RESCA project. The former uranium mining and processing site Kurday, located in Zambyl region in southern Kazakhstan is rich in naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORMs) and technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive materials (TENORMs). It has been {{recognized as one of the}} earliest uranium legacy production sites in Central Asia. In addition, the area is not only contaminated with uranium and its daughters, but also from associated trace metals which may pose a risk to man and the environment. The objectives of the thesis were to use the available outdoor and indoor radon concentrations as well as gamma dose rates/doses to estimate public annual effective doses from gamma and radon exposure in selected area of the site. The corresponding doses estimated from gamma and radon obtained in Kurday, Kazakhstan and Taboshar, Tajikistan were also compared. The risk of human stochastic effects (excess cancer) from the estimated total doses was also evaluated. The absorbed gamma dose rates in air were measured at every sampling sites and also in the dwellings, using different dosimeters like Geiger Muller type (DKS- 96 Automess) and scintillation type (SRP- 68, Radiagem) dosimeters. For every measurement points, the detectors were positioned 1 m above the ground and occasionally at ground. In addition, simulteneous outdoor and indoor radon concentrations measurements were conducted around the Pit Lake, at the hills around the lake and in a grid pattern at the mountain plateau. Radon detectors were also placed indoor in the dwellings of Kurday, and outdoor in the garden of the dwellings. Indoor and outdoor concentration of Rn in air were measured using both active and passive devices. The screenings of preliminary level of radon concentration were done by RAMON- 01, RRA AND PRM- 145. The track detectors were then placed for a longer period (2 - 9 months). All the data were analyzed using windows office EXCEL 2007 and minitab 16. For all analyisis, p values << 0. 05 were considered statistically significant. Annual average effective doses were estimated by extrapolating the abosorbed doses in air over the measured period and using the conversion factor 1 Sv/Gy. Indoor occupancy of 6000 hours per year was used, while 350 hours and 700 hours per year were applied for tailing piles and for gardens of houses, respectively, to estimate doses. In case of radon doses, equilibrium factor 0. 4 was used, while the dose <b>conversion</b> <b>factor</b> <b>applied</b> was 9 nSv/Bq/m 3 /hour. The occupancy factor used in radon calculations was similar to that of gamma doses for corresponding locations. Similarly, the risk of developing cancer in human was estimated using the risk factor of 5 × 10 - 2 per Sv. As a summary, the gamma dose rates were found to vary within the studied areas; highest at the Pit lake (0. 11 - 1. 07 μGy/h) and waste rock piles (0. 7 - 1. 05 μGy/h), inside dwellings (0. 131 - 0. 254 μGy/h) and lowest in the gardens (0. 07 - 0. 21 μGy/h). The calculated mean annual effective doses of gamma radiation at different areas of Kurday were; Pit lake (0. 31 ± 0. 26 mSv), waste rock piles (0. 36 ± 0. 05 mSv) inside room (1. 40 ± 1. 80 mSv) and garden (0. 11 ± 0. 02 mSv). One way ANOVA analysis showed the variation of mean dose rates for all the four areas investigated. The mean dose rate measured in waste rock piles was significantly higher (p<< 0. 05) than that in Pit Lake, inside dwellings and in gardens. The radon concentrations also varied according to the sites investigated. Peak radon concentrations were found in the living rooms and bedrooms of two selected houses exceeding 1000 Bq/m 3. The mean radon concentrations of indoor environment (inside rooms) were found to be significantly higher (p<< 0. 05) than that in outdoor conditions (gardens). The regression analyses of outdoor gamma dose rate and outdoor radon concentrations, and indoor gamma dose rates and indoor radon concentrations conditions showed that both of the combinations have p<< 0. 05 and R 2 around 76 %. The mean effective doses due to outdoor radon exposures at Kurday area was found to be 0. 13 ± 0. 05 mSv whereas, the mean effective dose due to indoor radon exposure was estimated to be 3. 91 ± 1. 80 mSv. Similarly, the mean concentration of uranium in drinking water from Muzbell dwelling area was found to be 26 μg/L and the annual effective dose was estimated to be 0. 25 mSv. The total dose calculated was 6. 31 mSv/year where indoor radon was the largest dose contributor. The dose could potentially contribute to health injuries to the individuals to develop one cancerous case to ionizing radiation- at a risk factor of 5 × 10 - 2 per Sv. In conclusion, the present study based on the summary report obtained in the NATO RESCA project and JNKKT project showed that the Kurday area of Kazakhstan represent sources of potential contamination of the living environment i. e. gamma radiation, radon exposure and the uranium concentration in drinking water sources. The outdoor gamma dose rates (0. 078 - 1. 226 μGy/h) were found to be higher than the indoor gamma dose rates (0. 013 - 0. 69 μGy/h), whereas the indoor radon concentrations inside dwellings (70 - 330 Bq/m 3) were recorded to be higher than the outdoor radon concentrations (30 - 90 Bq/m 3). The values of outdoor gamma dose rates, indoor and outdoor radon concentrations are considerably higher than global average corresponding values. The mean uranium concentration in drinking water from Muzbel dwelling area (26 μg/L) was also found to be higher than the recommended value by WHO. The highest dose contribution to humans was obtained from indoor radon concentration (0. 18 - 7. 13 mSv) in the houses of Kurday area. The doses from indoor gamma radiation was also significantly high (0. 14 - 4. 14 mSv), while that from drinking water (0. 25 mSv) was quite low (within the recommended value) compared to indoor radon and gamma radiation doses. The outdoor annual gamma doses obtained in Kurday, Kazakhstan were found to be similar to the outdoor gamma doses observed in Taboshar, Tajikistan (around 0. 6 mSv). However, the outdoor radon in Taboshar was found to be five times higher than that in Kurday, both the values were lower than the global recommended values. Similarly, the indoor radon dose and indoor gamma dose in Kurday and that in Taboshar were in the comparable range. However, the peak values for indoor gamma doses were found to be higher in Kurday than those in Taboshar region. The radiological risk to human (cancer) from the total dose was estimated to be one cancerous case in Kurday with 3000 population. Therefore, on the basis of the present findings, it can be recommended that interventions should be made at the high doses sites in Kurday region in order to minimize the probability of human stochastic effects and thereby limit the public doses as low as reasonably achievable...|$|E

The calculation yielded an integrated flux of 7. 3 × 10 − 4 neutrons/cm 2 /incident proton at the PS exit. The peak of the spectrum is at about 100 keV, and the high edge at 10 MeV. Sullivan [2] says the flux/dose <b>conversion</b> <b>factor</b> is 40 fSv/neutron/m 2 for neutrons between 1 - 50 MeV, 40 ×E 0. 8 (in MeV) between 10 keV and 1 MeV, and 1 below 10 keV.

40|$|Abstract: Forest {{inventory}} data {{often provide}} the required base data {{to enable the}} large area mapping of biomass over a range of scales. However, spatially explicit estimates of above-ground biomass (AGB) over large areas may be limited by the spatial extent of the forest inventory relative {{to the area of}} interest (i. e., inventories not spatially exhaustive), or by the omission of inventory attributes required for biomass estimation. These spatial and attributional gaps in the forest inventory may result in an underestimation of large area AGB. The continuous nature and synoptic coverage of remotely sensed data have led to their increased application for AGB estimation over large areas, although the use of these data remains challenging in complex forest environments. In this paper, we present an approach to generating spatially explicit estimates of large area AGB by integrating AGB estimates from multiple data sources; 1. using a lookup table of <b>conversion</b> <b>factors</b> <b>applied</b> to a non-spatially exhaustive forest inventory dataset (R 2 = 0. 64; RMSE = 16. 95 t/ha), 2. applying a lookup table to unique combinations of land cover and vegetation density outputs derived from remotely sensed data (R 2 = 0. 52; RMSE = 19. 97 t/ha), and 3. hybrid mapping by augmenting forest inventory AGB estimates with remotely sensed AGBSensors 2008, 8 53...|$|R

MethodsLegs with untreated isolated GSV reflux and varices limited to its territory and control legs were studied clinically, with duplex ultrasound and photoplethysmography. GSV diameters were measured at both the SFJ and the PT. A <b>conversion</b> <b>factor</b> was calculated and used to compare published data. ResultsOf 182 legs, 60 had no GSV reflux (controls; group I), 51 had above-knee GSV reflux only (group II) and 71 had GSV reflux above and below knee (group III). GSV diameters in group I measured 7. 5  mm (± 1. 8) at the SFJ and 3. 7  mm (± 0. 9) at the PT. In groups II and III, they measured 10. 9  mm (± 3. 9) at the SFJ and 6. 3  mm (± 1. 9) at the PT (p <  0. 001 each).

FRRF-derived productivity rates are based on estimates of charge separation in reaction center II (ETR RCII), which must be converted into ecologically relevant units of carbon fixation. Understanding sources of variability in the coupling of ETR RCII and carbon fixation provides physiological insight into phytoplankton photosynthesis and is critical for the application of FRRF as a primary productivity measurement tool. In the present study, we simultaneously measured phytoplankton carbon fixation and ETR RCII in the iron-limited NE subarctic Pacific {{over the course of a}} diurnal cycle. We show that rates of ETR RCII are closely tied to the diurnal cycle in light availability, whereas rates of carbon fixation appear to be influenced by endogenous changes in metabolic energy allocation under iron-limited conditions. Unsynchronized diurnal oscillations of the two rates led to 3. 5 -fold changes in the <b>conversion</b> <b>factor</b> between ETR RCII and carbon fixation (K c / n PSII).

In this method, a tracer gas (commonly helium) leaks past the test seal and is transported to the leak detector where the leak rate is quantified. To predict the air leak rate, a <b>conversion</b> <b>factor</b> of helium-to-air is applied depending on the magnitude of the helium flow rate.

An established pressure decay method with constant differential pressure was used to evaluate both the air and helium leak rates of the O-ring under similar temperature and pressure conditions. The results from the pressure decay tests showed, for the elastomer O-ring, that neither the molecular flow nor the viscous flow helium-to-air <b>conversion</b> <b>factors</b> were applicable. Leak rate tests were also performed using nitrogen and argon as the test gas. Molecular mass and viscosity based helium-to-test gas <b>conversion</b> <b>factors</b> were <b>applied,</b> but did not correctly predict the measured leak rates of either gas. To further this study, the effect of pressure boundary conditions was investigated. Often, pressure decay leak rate tests are performed at a differential pressure of 101. 3 kPa with atmospheric pressure on the downstream side of the test seal. In space applications, the differential pressure is similar, but with vacuum as the downstream pressure. The same O-ring was tested at four unique differential pressures ranging from 34. 5 to 137. 9 kPa. Up to six combinations of upstream and downstream pressures for each differential pressure were compared. For a given differential pressure, the various combinations of upstream and downstream dry air pressures did not significantly affect the leak rate. As expected, the leak rate of the O-ring increased with increasing differential pressure. The results suggested that the current leak test pressure conditions, used to verify spacecraft sealing systems with elastomer seals, produce accurate values even though the boundary conditions do not model the space application...|$|R
40|$|Assessment of {{airborne}} fungi is important {{due to their}} potential impacts on health and on global climate. Conventional culture-based methods often lead to underestimation {{of airborne}} fungal levels {{and the results are}} often not reproducible. Ergosterol, a primary sterol in cell membrane of fungi, had been proposed as a biomarker for assessing ambient fungal prevalence. To serve such purpose, reliable <b>conversion</b> <b>factors</b> of ergosterol to number concentrations of fungal spores should be established. The prerequisite of reliable <b>conversion</b> <b>factors</b> is the understanding of the ergosterol content in individual species of fungal spores or yeast cells that is commonly found in the ambient environment. Therefore, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to determine ergosterol contents of the dominant fungal spores/yeast cells collected from the ambient aerosols and cultivated in the laboratory. The ergosterol contents of the 12 common airborne species studied in this thesis ranged from 0. 047 to 9. 919 pg/spore or yeast cell. It was found that the larger the surface area of the spore, the higher the ergosterol content. Ergosterol contents of the spores also varied with culturing age of the fungal vegetative growth and became steady when the fungi growth became mature. Decomposition but not all of ergosterol in some dead species was found and change of ergosterol contents under the effects of cold storage was observed. With the known spore ergosterol contents of the common ambient species determined, a weighted average <b>conversion</b> <b>factor,</b> 0. 197 pg/spore, was established with respect to the relative contributions of the common and dominant ambient species. This weighted average <b>conversion</b> <b>factor</b> of ergosterol to the number concentration of fungal spores and yeast cells were applied to field filter-based measured ergosterol content. The geometric mean of estimated number concentrations was 1757 spores/m 3 (geometric standard deviation: 2. 85), matched in the order of magnitude with the geometric mean of culturable fungal concentrations, which was 475 CFU/m 3 (geometric standard deviation: 2. 18), taking the general consensus of the underestimation in viable sampling. Apart from testing the applicability of this weighted average <b>conversion</b> <b>factor</b> to the field samples in this study, the <b>conversion</b> <b>factor</b> was also <b>applied</b> to archived ergosterol dataset. The results verified that the <b>conversion</b> <b>factor</b> is applicable in assessing the ambient airborne fungal prevalence. As the origin of a large portion of atmospheric organic carbon remains unidentified, the study of fungal contribution to the atmospheric organic carbon becomes important. With similar approach, a weighted average <b>conversion</b> <b>factor</b> for organic carbon to number concentration, and vice versa, was established. The fungal contribution to atmospheric organic carbon was found to be as high as 7. 43 % in one of the aerosol samples. This thesis highlighted the significance and feasibility of the establishment of proper <b>conversion</b> <b>factors</b> for biomarkers in assessing ambient fungal prevalence.

As the brightest molecular line in the submillimetre, {{it is important to}} quantify the contribution of CO flux to the dust continuum bands. <b>Conversion</b> <b>factors</b> were used to convert molecular line integrated intensities to flux detected by bolometer arrays in mJy per beam. These factors were calculated for 12 CO line integrated intensities to the SCUBA- 2 850 μm and 450 μm bands. The <b>conversion</b> <b>factors</b> were then <b>applied</b> to HARP 12 CO 3 - 2 maps of NGC 1333 in the Perseus complex and NGC 2071 and NGC 2024 in the Orion B molecular cloud complex to quantify the respective 12 CO flux contribution to the 850 μm dust continuum emission. Sources with high molecular line contamination were analysed in further detail for molecular outflows and heating by nearby stars to determine the cause of the 12 CO contribution. The majority of sources had a 12 CO 3 - 2 flux contribution under 20 per cent. However, in regions of molecular outflows, the 12 CO can dominate the source dust continuum (up to 79 per cent contamination) with 12 CO fluxes reaching ∼ 68 mJy per beam.

40|$|The German Remote Sensing Data Center {{operates}} the Biosphere Energy Transfer Hydrology Model, a process model that estimates the NPP of agricultural areas. The model {{is driven by}} remote sensing data and meteorological data. Remotely sensed datasets including a time series of the leaf area index, which describes vegetation condition, and a land cover classification, which provides information about land use, are needed. Currently leaf area indices and land cover data derived from the sensor VEGETATION are used. Both datasets have spatial resolutions of about 1 km 2 and are freely available for the area of investigation (Germany and Austria). The meteorological input parameters are obtained from the ECMWF, with a spatial resolution of about 0. 25 ° and a temporal resolution up to four times daily. The output of the model, the GPP, is calculated at daily resolution. By subtracting the cumulative plant maintenance and growth respiration, the NPP is then determined. In order to validate the modelled NPP, crop yield estimates derived from the national statistics of Germany and Austria are used. After estimating above ground biomass using plant-specific above- to below-ground ratios, <b>conversion</b> <b>factors</b> are <b>applied</b> to estimate total biomass. Finally the carbon content of dry matter is estimated. To correlate model results with these statistical data, the modelled data are aggregated to NPP per administrative district.

40|$|With the {{amendments}} of the Radiation Protection Ordinance of August 1, 2001, {{and of the}} X-ray Ordinance of July 1, 2002, new phantom-related dose measurands for external and internal exposure were introduced in Germany. The concept of the dose quantities in radiation protection changed, and the PTB had to adjust its standard measuring devices to the changed realization and dissemination of the unit sievert for the new dose measurands. Also, calibration methods as, for example, for personal dosemeters, had to be modified. Add to this regulations {{for the protection of}} flight personnel from exposure to cosmic radiation and, thus, the inclusion of environmental radiation into radiation monitoring. All this led to changes in the requirements for dosementers in standards, guidelines and regulations and, thus, also to modifications of the PTB requirements for the approval of radiation protection dosemeters. The present report gives a coherent description of these subjects with regard to external radiation. It is intended for all those who are interested in the new concepts of radiation protection dosimetry and the measuring technology for radiation protection dosemeters, but in particular also for developers and distributors of new dosemeters. Updated tables of the <b>conversion</b> <b>factors</b> <b>applied</b> at the PTB and of the PTB's calibration capabilities, practical rules for the adoption of the new measurands, and a list of the national and international standards which at present are of relevance round off this report. (orig.) Mit den Novellierungen der Strahlenschutzverordnung vom 1. August 2001 und der Roentgenverordnung vom 1.

Die PTB musste sich mit ihren Normal-Messeinrichtungen auf eine neue Darstellung und Weitergabe der Einheit Sievert fuer die neuen Dosis-Messgroessen umstellen. Auch Kalibrierverfahren, z.

Hinzu kamen Regelungen zum Schutz des fliegenden Personals vor Expositionen durch kosmische Strahlung und damit eine Einbeziehung der Umgebungsstrahlung in die Strahlenschutzueberwachung. All dies fuehrte zu geaenderten Anforderungen an Dosimeter in Normen, Richtlinien und Vorschriften und damit auch zu geaenderten Bauartanforderungen der PTB fuer Strahlenschutzdosimeter. Der vorliegende Bericht stellt diesen Themenkomplex fuer externe Strahlung zusammenhaengend dar. Er wendet sich an alle, die an den Neuerungen in den Konzepten der Strahlenschutzdosimetrie und der Messtechnik von Strahlenschutzdosimetern interessiert sind, an diejenigen, die dosimetrische Messungen im Strahlenschutz durchfuehren, insbesondere aber auch an Entwickler und Vertreiber von neuen Dosimetern.

Also, during capture larvae are often found {{with their eyes}} missing. In this work we analysed tissues effects (muscle, head, eye, gut and the whole larvae) on RNA:DNA ratios from different species (Sardina pilchardus, Engraulis encrasicolus, Atherina presbyter and Paralichthys orbignyanus) in different developmental stages and from dif-ferent locations. For all species and development phases, it was shown that RNA:DNA ratios in the head were significantly lower than in muscle or gut. The comparison of RNA:DNA ratios of head with or without eyes did not show significant differences. In a comparison of results from muscle from two tail sections, RNA:DNA ratios were higher for the anterior sec-tion in Sardina pilchardus and Engraulis encrasicolus larvae. Caution is needed when RNA:DNA ratios are compared with other studies employing different dissection protocols.

30|$|The {{majority}} of the research in the gas system focuses on simplifications of the nonlinear equations that govern the physics of gas flow {{as well as the}} general representation of the technical components (e.g. compressor model) of the gas transmission system. A current useful and efficient way to alleviate the burden of the nonconvex MINLP gas problem is the application of mixed integer linear programming techniques for piecewise linearization. In this way, the nonlinear formulation is approached by approximated linearized functions that render the problem as a MIP, which enables the computation of global optima within fast execution times. The most comprehensive article that studies the advantages and drawbacks of various MIP formulations for the gas optimization problem is [5], where different piecewise linearization approaches are tested for different test cases in both dynamic and stationary conditions in order to derive conclusions about the more accurate and faster approximations. Based on the results, the authors argue about the effectiveness of the incremental method and further apply it in [6] and [7] in order to linearize the transient flow equations for a combined electricity-gas model that is applied on the Belgian high-calorific gas network, where the effects of initial linepack in system operation are examined. A simpler linearization approach can be seen in [8] and [9] for a stochastic unit commitment and a combined optimal power flow model, respectively. Simple electricity-gas <b>conversion</b> <b>factors</b> are <b>applied</b> to all studies and the compressor machine modeling is also reduced to a compression factor. The incremental method is again applied in [10] for stationary gas flow within a large decomposition framework.|$|R
