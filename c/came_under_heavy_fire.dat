While the Ju52s {{transporting}} the German paratroops <b>came</b> <b>under</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>fire,</b> Lent's Rotte engaged the enemy ground positions. Lent's starboard engine caught fire, forcing him to land immediately. With Kubisch manning the movable machine gun, Lent negotiated the capitulation with the Norwegian ground forces and the airfield was in German hands.|$|E
5|$|Assuming this {{warning shot}} {{had been fired}} {{in the belief that}} his brig, which was not flying a flag, may be an enemy vessel, Barlow ordered the British naval ensign and the pennant of the Channel Fleet run up. Thus clearly {{identified}} as a neutral British warship, Barlow allowed Childers to drift closer inshore with the tide. The French battery responded by raising tricolour flags and red pennants, a move copied by the other batteries covering the Goulet. Having drifted much closer to two batteries Childers suddenly <b>came</b> <b>under</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>fire,</b> the batteries containing very large 48-pounder cannon.|$|E

5|$|Soon after, {{the company}} <b>came</b> <b>under</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>fire</b> {{from an old}} quarry {{occupied}} by over one hundred German soldiers who possessed as many as forty machine guns. Severe casualties were sustained {{as they began to}} advance for attack, including the company commander who fell seriously wounded. Taking command of the attack, Ingram rallied the men and rushed forward. Jumping into the quarry, he charged the first post himself, shooting six German soldiers and capturing a machine gun. The German forces were soon overcome, and thirty troops subsequently surrendered.|$|E
5|$|To replace these officers, Second Lieutenant Innes of 1 Company {{was ordered}} forward {{to gather the}} {{survivors}} and withdraw, forming up at a barricade {{on the edge of}} the Hollow. Innes regrouped the survivors and, following a heavy bombardment from supporting artillery and with his own company providing covering fire, assisted the Coldstream Guards in a second attack at 10:15. Weighed down with entrenching equipment, the attacking Coldstream Guardsmen faltered and began to suffer heavy casualties. Innes too <b>came</b> <b>under</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>fire</b> from a German barricade to their front equipped with a machine gun.|$|E
5|$|Able {{to attack}} the HEIC ships individually, Caroline pulled {{alongside}} Europe at 06:30 and began a heavy fire into the merchant ship, which intermittently replied with her available guns. Within 30 minutes, Europes rigging was tattered, many of her guns dismounted {{and a number of}} her crew wounded or killed. Moving past his now disabled opponent, Féretier next attacked Streatham, which had slowed in an unsuccessful attempt to support Europe. Now alone against the frigate, Streatham <b>came</b> <b>under</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>fire</b> at 07:00 and by 08:00 was badly damaged, with casualties in her crew, her guns all dismounted and her lascars hiding below decks. With further resistance hopeless, Dale hauled down the company flag and surrendered.|$|E
50|$|Matt and his {{remaining}} troops <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>fire</b> with Matt being wounded and Veddors killed. In Chungtu village, they reach a Red Cross hospital, and soon Donna too arrives there. There she hears that Stephen was {{killed during the}} fighting. The enemy tanks thrust forward and force the survivors to retreat further. When U.S. aircraft attack and stop the tanks, Matt, Donna {{and the rest of}} the convoy escape.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, 26 Madras and 9 Garhwal Rifles (reserve troops) had <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>fire</b> {{from the}} Langar rooftop, Guru Ramdas Serai and the {{buildings}} in the vicinity. Moreover, they {{took a lot of}} time in forcing open the heavy Southern Gate, which had to be shot open with tank fire. This delay caused a lot of casualties among the Indian troops fighting inside the complex. Three tanks and an APC had entered the complex (all 3 tanks and the APC were destroyed).|$|R
5000|$|The U.S. {{plans for}} reconstructing Iraq have also <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>fire.</b> In a February 2006 report, Stuart W. Bowen Jr., the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, wrote that: [...] "There was {{insufficient}} systematic planning for human capital management in Iraq {{before and during}} the U.S.-directed stabilisation and reconstruction operations." [...] Critics have particularly chastised the Pentagon, which was charged with preparing for the post-invasion period, for largely ignoring a $5 million study entitled the Future of Iraq Project, which the U.S. State Department compiled in the year preceding the invasion.|$|R
5|$|An {{additional}} Iraqi column {{crossed the}} Saudi border to the East, although still along the coast, towards {{the city of}} Khafji. These Iraqi tanks were screened by the 5th Mechanized Battalion of the 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade. This battalion withdrew when it <b>came</b> <b>under</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>fire,</b> {{as it had been}} ordered to not engage the Iraqi column. Elements of the 8th and 10th Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigades also conducted similar screening operations. Due to the order to not engage, the road to Khafji was left open. At one point, Iraqi T-55s of another column rolled up to the Saudi border, signaling that they intended to surrender. As they were approached by Saudi Arabian troops, they reversed their turrets and opened fire. This prompted air support from a nearby AC-130, destroying 13 vehicles.|$|E
5|$|As soon as {{the lead}} T-34s reached the minefield, they <b>came</b> <b>under</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>fire</b> from the fort's garrison. Soon all three tanks were either {{destroyed}} or damaged, so the combat engineers proceeded to breach the minefield on their own. Israeli aircraft began strafing and bombing the Egyptian forces for over {{two and a half}} hours while encountering no resistance, leading to the destruction of all six tanks and five vehicles. The Israelis bombed Egyptian forces at the minefield and on an area of the strip stretching two kilometers towards Port Fouad. Under fire from the air and from the fort, the attack bogged down to a complete halt before the Egyptians began to retreat. Salah ordered his battalion to assume defensive positions east of Port Fouad to repel any Israeli counterattack and to regroup.|$|E
5|$|From {{the moment}} of its {{founding}} the school was marred in controversy due to Senator Douglas's support of slavery and his authorship of the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Early fundraising efforts were further hampered as Douglas <b>came</b> <b>under</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>fire</b> during {{the run-up to the}} 1860 presidential election for his ownership of 123 slaves and a 3000-acre cotton plantation in Lawrence County, Mississippi. In response, trustees further encumbered the land to fund the university's operations while funneling cash donations to a separate account for what is today the University of Chicago Divinity School (which temporarily moved to a separate campus in Morgan Park before rejoining the larger university in its current location in Hyde Park location in 1891).|$|E
40|$|The US {{mortgage}} crisis, {{which has}} spiralled {{into what is}} now seen as the most serious global financial upheaval since the 1930 s, has provoked criticism of the Federal Reserve for its failure to recognise, and act on, the real estate bubble. Credit rating agencies, too, have <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>fire</b> for having actively contributed to the present crisis. Should central banks pay special attention to, and try to influence, the development of asset prices? Is statutory regulation of rating agencies required? If so, what form should it take?

50|$|Prior to {{the release}} of SilverFin, the idea of a Young Bond series had not gone over too well with the fans of the more {{traditional}} Bond literature and had <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>fire,</b> with some fans comparing it to an unsuccessful 1960s attempt by Bonds publishers to launch a youth-oriented line of fiction that resulted in only one book: The Adventures of James Bond Junior 003½ written by the pseudonymous R. D. Mascott. There was also a moderately successful James Bond Jr. television series in the early 1990s aimed at children that dealt with Bonds supposed nephew.|$|R
40|$|Literary canons, or {{lists of}} authorial books, have <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>fire</b> recently, but, {{in spite of}} this, they {{continue}} to exist and to thrive. One such canon is the Italian canon abroad, that is, that list of Italian authors who have emerged as authoritative figures in the literature, culture and education of non-Italian speaking peoples of the twentieth century. This paper focuses on this canon, its historical evolution and the gradual inclusion in it of its constituent members, namely, Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, Ariosto, Tasso, Machiavelli, Vico and Pirandello. The dominance of these authors abroad is explored from their preeminence in educational curricula, translations, and serious engagement by non-Italian writers...|$|R
5|$|ML 306 also <b>came</b> <b>under</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>fire</b> when {{it arrived}} near the port. Sergeant Thomas Durrant of No. 1 Commando, manning the aft Lewis gun, engaged gun and {{searchlight}} {{positions on the}} run in. He was wounded but refused to leave the gun for treatment. The ML reached the open sea but was attacked at short range by the German torpedo boat Jaguar. Durrant returned fire, aiming for the torpedo boat's bridge. He was wounded again but remained at his gun even after the German commander asked for their surrender. Firing drum after drum of ammunition, he {{refused to give up}} until after the ML had been boarded. Durrant died of his wounds and, after the recommendation of the Jaguars commander, was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross.|$|E
5|$|She {{was part}} of a {{flotilla}} which toured ports during the summer of 1889. Zhiyuans sole action was at the Battle of the Yalu River on 17 September 1894 during the First Sino-Japanese War. During the battle, she <b>came</b> <b>under</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>fire</b> from the Japanese forces. Having been holed, Deng ordered for the ship to ram an opposing vessel. She was destroyed as she closed, either by a hit on one of her torpedo tubes, or from a Japanese torpedo. This attack, and the subsequent story of her captain and his dog have become embedded in popular culture in the People's Republic of China. A replica of the Zhiyuan was constructed in 2014 at the Port of Dandong, while the wreck was discovered in 2013 after a 16-year search.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} force left Bremerhaven {{early on}} 8 April 1940, bound for Kristiansand. When they arrived, a heavy fog obscured the city, making {{the passage of}} the fjord outside the harbor very dangerous. As a result, they had to wait until the following morning to begin the attack. As Karlsruhe entered the fjord, she <b>came</b> <b>under</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>fire</b> from the Norwegian coastal guns at Odderøya Fortress. The cruiser turned in the fjord to bring her full broadside into action; the artillery duel lasted for about two hours before heavy fog again covered the port, forcing both sides to cease fire. The Norwegians surrendered an hour later, and the German ships landed their soldiers.|$|E
50|$|The game {{begins in}} Los Angeles, as Corporal James Walker infiltrates the NSA {{building}} with Privates Colt and Kelly {{in order to}} secure important intel from the servers. After fighting through a few K.P.R. personnel, the three successfully complete their mission. However, Colt and Kelly are killed prior to extraction, and their vehicle is destroyed. After Walker escapes the ambush, he travels to the lobby, where he meets up with Captain Turner and his men. Upon arriving however, the group <b>comes</b> <b>under</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>fire,</b> and the building collapses. Despite this, Walker survives, and he and Turner are able to force their way to the extraction point.|$|R

On 24 May the battalion was sent to Viller Berquin, and on the 25th to Strazelle where they encountered German tanks and took <b>heavy</b> <b>fire.</b> On the 25th/26th they moved on to rouge Croix, taking a defensive position facing Hazebrouck, then pulled back to Mont de Cats.

5|$|A Company {{attacked}} the ridgeline {{to the north}} of the road to Chonju just prior to dusk, this time without the support of the Sherman tanks. The Australians again <b>came</b> <b>under</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>fire</b> from the North Koreans, however they quickly overcame the defenders and the ridge was secured by 17:30. During the fighting for the northern position, three North Korean T-34 tanks dug-in on the ridgeline had been destroyed by the Australians at short range with new M20 3.5-inch bazookas, which now proved to be effective anti-armour weapons despite difficulties experienced in their use at Kujin several days before. During the day's fighting, a total of 11 T-34 tanks and two SU-76 self-propelled guns had been destroyed by the Australian infantry and American tanks, contrary to the reports of their destruction by USAF airstrikes earlier in the day. Expecting a counter-attack, Green then ordered B Company forward to occupy positions along the road in between the positions held by D and A Companies, while Battalion headquarters moved in behind B Company, with C Company held in reserve at the rear with Support Company. After conducting a limited resupply of the forward companies, the Australians hastily began to dig in.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} losses which left gaping {{holes in the}} Allied line, {{it was decided that}} the next stage of the advance was to go ahead. At 08:25, parties from the 34th and 35th Battalions headed out along the {{south-eastern}} edge of the ridge towards the outskirts of Passchendaele. Almost immediately, they <b>came</b> <b>under</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>fire</b> from a pillbox close by a railway embankment, at which time Major J.B. Buchanan, the senior brigade officer with the advance party, fell dead, leaving Jeffries to assume control. Gathering a party of eleven men, he set about silencing the machine gun position. Edging across the open ground, the party attacked the position from the west just as the machine gun was firing to the north. Realising that an attack was imminent, the machine gunner switched around, mortally wounding Jeffries in the stomach and sending the rest of the party to ground. When its fire eased, the remaining members of the group worked around the position, rushed it and seized two machine guns in conjunction with thirty prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, one of Reshef's {{mechanized}} battalions, {{commanded by}} Major Nathan Shunari, was reinforced with company-sized {{remnants of the}} 40th Tank Battalion, now commanded by Captain Gideon Giladi after the previous battalion commander had been wounded. Shunari was ordered to seize the Lexicon-Tirtur junction. He sent the tank company ahead first, which initially reported no Egyptian units. Shunari dispatched an infantry unit in six half-tracks to the junction. Upon reaching it, they discovered that the tank company had already been destroyed and Giladi killed. Soon the vehicles began <b>came</b> <b>under</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>fire,</b> stopping their advance. The unit commander reported casualties, and Shunari ordered {{the remainder of his}} battalion to aid the pinned-down men. Attempts to rescue the infantry failed, and the Egyptian battalion defending the junction directed heavy firepower against the area, aided by the brigade's artillery. The Egyptian defenders had managed to catch the Israelis in a prepared killing zone. Shunari, whose troops lacked cover and were threatened with annihilation, regrouped some of his forces and managed to escape the area in vehicles, but the infantry half-track unit first sent to the crossroads remained pinned down.|$|E

5|$|That September, McKinley's {{regiment}} {{was called}} east to reinforce General John Pope's Army of Virginia at the Second Battle of Bull Run. Delayed in passing through Washington, D.C., the 23rd Ohio did not arrive {{in time for}} the battle, but joined the Army of the Potomac as it hurried north to cut off Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia as it advanced into Maryland. The 23rd was the first regiment to encounter the Confederates at the Battle of South Mountain on September 14. After severe losses, Union forces drove back the Confederates and continued to Sharpsburg, Maryland, where they engaged Lee's army at the Battle of Antietam, one of the bloodiest battles of the war. The 23rd was also {{in the thick of the}} fighting at Antietam, and McKinley himself <b>came</b> <b>under</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>fire</b> when bringing rations to the men on the line. McKinley's regiment again suffered many casualties, but the Army of the Potomac was victorious and the Confederates retreated into Virginia. The regiment was then detached from the Army of the Potomac and returned by train to western Virginia.|$|E
5|$|The next British {{airborne}} unit to {{land was}} the 5th Parachute Brigade, commanded by Brigadier Nigel Poett. The brigade was designated {{to land on}} drop zoneB and achieved this, although not as accurately as 3rd Parachute Brigade due to poor visibility around the drop zone, which also {{made it more difficult}} for paratroopers of the brigade to rally. The drop zone <b>came</b> <b>under</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>fire</b> from German troops stationed nearby, and was subjected to shellfire and mortaring which inflicted casualties in the battalion rendezvous areas. However, the 7th Parachute Battalion soon cleared the DZ of German troops, many of whom were situated in farms and houses, and the 12th Parachute Battalion and 13th Parachute Battalion rapidly secured the rest of the brigade's objectives. The brigade was then ordered to move due east and clear an area near Schnappenberg, as well as to engage German forces gathered {{to the west of the}} farmhouse where the 6th Airborne Division Headquarters was established. By 15:30 Brigadier Poett reported that the brigade had secured all of its objectives and linked up with other British airborne units.|$|E
5|$|With his route back to France {{suddenly}} closed, Bonaparte consolidated {{his position}} in Egypt and then attacked north into Ottoman Syria. The operation achieved some initial success, but British dominance at sea heavily influenced the campaign: the siege train was captured on its coastal barges, all supplies had to be brought overland and any French operations near the shoreline <b>came</b> <b>under</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>fire</b> from Royal Navy warships, particularly at the culminating Siege of Acre. An attempt by the French Atlantic Fleet {{to intervene in the}} Mediterranean, known as the Croisière de Bruix, failed in July 1799. Defeated at Acre and driven back to Egypt, Bonaparte decided to return to France in November 1799 in order to take charge of the deteriorating situation in the War of the Second Coalition. He could only evacuate a small number of advisors with him on the frigates Muiron and Carrère, but promised the army remaining in Egypt under General Jean Baptiste Kléber that he would send support and reinforcements from Europe. Bonaparte successfully reached France without interception by British forces and on 9 November 1799 seized power in the coup of 18 Brumaire and proclaimed himself First Consul.|$|E
