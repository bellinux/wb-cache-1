This study has also explored that compared to national brands, it is widely accepted that store brands have very higher perceived risk in terms of quality, although many consumers felt that store brand quality was the same or even better than national brands. Finally, this study suggests that Malaysian hypermarket industries should emphasize on how to remove perceived risk from the mind of consumers for both retailers and manufacturers as these are verified to have significant relationship with consumers ’ attitude towards retailer bands in Malaysian hypermarkets...|$|E
