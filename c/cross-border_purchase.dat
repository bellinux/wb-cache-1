40|$|Access to {{affordable}} {{prescription drug}} {{is the critical}} mass of any meaningful public health policy. However, the spiralling prescription drug costs and the concomitant access problems are transcendent, posing a daunting challenge for governments of both rich and poor countries. Arguably the greatest challenge for policy makers is how best to secure affordable prescription drug {{in the name of}} welfare and equity, without trammelling innovative medicine. However, the combustible mixture of patents, markets, and the pharmaceutical industry’s penchant for maximising profits, has helped shape the current trajectory of pharmaceutical R&D disproportionate targeting of profitable drug representing just ten per cent of the world’s disease burden. By the same markets token, the United States, the country with the most competitive pharmaceutical industry, still struggles against the tide of <b>cross-border</b> <b>purchase</b> of cheaper prescription drug by her citizens in Canada and Mexico. In Britain, as in most European countries, the highly regulated prescription drug pricing regime under the national health insurance scheme, often excludes expensive ‘drug of last resort’ albeit with proven clinical benefits. India has been regulating drug prices since the 1950 s, and the recent spike in cheaper generics of patented drugs, has exacerbated tensions, and set local and foreign pharmaceutical industry on a collision course. Using empirical data and relevant literature, the paper critically reviews the cumulative effects of the legal and socio-economic externalities that shape the current global pharmaceutical production trajectory. While noting the imperatives of equitably balancing the inherent conflicts between the pharmaceutical industry’s profit-maximising objectives and public health needs, the paper canvasses for the supplementation of the current patents and markets driven monocultural prescription drug economics, with a normative, non-market, internationally mediated drug production paradigm that is cognisant of the overriding public health needs...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Legal tobacco tax {{avoidance}} {{strategies such as}} <b>cross-border</b> cigarette <b>purchasing</b> may attenuate the impact of tax increases on tobacco consumption. Little is known about socioeconomic and country variations in <b>cross-border</b> <b>purchasing.</b> OBJECTIVE: To describe socioeconomic and country variations in <b>cross-border</b> cigarette <b>purchasing</b> in six European countries. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from adult smokers (n= 7873) from the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Surveys in France (2006 / 2007), Germany (2007), Ireland (2006), The Netherlands (2008), Scotland (2006) {{and the rest of}} the UK (2007 / 2008) were used. Respondents were asked whether they had bought cigarettes outside their country in the last 6 months and how often. FINDINGS: In French and German provinces/states bordering countries with lower cigarette prices, 24 % and 13 % of smokers, respectively, reported purchasing cigarettes frequently outside their country. In non-border regions of France and Germany, and in Ireland, Scotland, the rest of the UK and The Netherlands, frequent purchasing of cigarettes outside the country was reported by 2 - 7 % of smokers. Smokers with higher levels of education or income, younger smokers, daily smokers, heavier smokers and smokers not planning to quit smoking were more likely to purchase cigarettes outside their country. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Cross-border</b> cigarette <b>purchasing</b> is more common in European regions bordering countries with lower cigarette prices and is more often reported by smokers with higher education and income. Increasing taxes in countries with lower cigarette prices, and reducing the number of cigarettes that can be legally imported across borders could help to avoid <b>cross-border</b> <b>purchasing...</b>|$|R

Enforcement reduces welfare if administrative and uncertainty costs outweigh the benefits of consumption changes and the reduction in resource costs. The analysis shows that the welfare effect of evasion depends on how well designed the tax system is and how effective enforcement resources are in deterring border crossing. ...|$|R

The results achieved by the empirical research coincide and support the principal result of the theoretical literature: the tax differentials between neighboring territories induce consumers to purchase in the territory where taxation is lower, on the condition that the tax saving compensates for the transport costs associated with the travel made by the purchaser in order to take advantage of the lower taxation...|$|R
40|$|Cigarette {{smoking is}} {{concentrated}} among low income groups. Consequently, cigarette taxes are considered regressive. However, if poorer individuals {{are much more}} price sensitive than richer individuals, then tax increases would reduce smoking much more among the poor and their cigarette tax expenditures {{as a share of}} income would rise by much less than for the rich. Warner (2000) said this phenomenon would make cigarette tax increases progressive. We test this empirically. Among low-, middle-, and high-income, we estimate total price elasticities of - 0. 37, - 0. 35, and - 0. 20, respectively. We find that cigarette tax increases are not close to progressive using both tax expenditure-based and traditional welfare measures. This finding is robust to <b>cross-border</b> <b>purchasing,</b> generic cigarettes, and substantial external effects. However, we find that taxes can be progressive under some behavioral economic models (Gruber & Koszegi, 2004) but that these may only apply to a small share of smokers. ...|$|R

Within SEPA, citizens {{will be able to}} make and receive payments to and from other euro countries as easily and safely, and on the same conditions, as in their own country using one bank account and one set of payment instruments (debit card, credit transfer and direct debit). This study reveals that the Dutch pay differently for their <b>cross-border</b> <b>purchases</b> than for their domestic purchases and that payment behaviour differs per euro country. The limited cross-border acceptance of the debit card hampers its cross-border usage and encourages the usage of cash and credit cards. Furthermore the Dutch most often use electronic transfers, followed by the credit card, for remote cross-border payments. The speed at which the Dutch will switch over to European debit cards and credit transfers will depend heavily on acceptance levels, prices and safety. Migration to the European direct debit may be hardest to archieve. Here, safety is of vital importance. ...|$|R

Third, DG competition, led by Mario Monti, wished to push through the ability of consumers to make <b>cross-border</b> <b>purchases</b> of cars.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of the EULIS project, the purpose of which was the {{unification}} of national real property registers, it is particularly interesting to study the differences between European legal systems in respect of real property registry law. This thesis compares Sweden and the Civil law system with Ireland and the Common law system. The purpose of this comparison is to illustrate the complications that might arise in transactions between different systems, and it will argue that future cooperation will benefit from being subject to one unified European Real Property Law. Sweden and Ireland differ in their definition of real property and land. Whereas the Swedish legislature defines land as a unit of earth surface that is registered in the Real Property Register, the Irish definition is broader and more abstract. This can cause confusion as to what is really purchased when a buyer from one country wishes to operate within the other. Both systems emphasise the necessity of form, not only in the actual purchase but also when registering the sale. Whereas registering the sale gives right of ownership over previous buyers, it is sufficient to present a contract of sale to establish right of ownership over any third party who might have a claim towards the seller. Registering the property also serves the purpose of having the transaction recognised by the state. The Irish system, however, has two systems of registration, where only one grants the buyer such recognition. This double registration system creates confusion for foreign actors on the Irish property market. EULIS has been developed to provide a single register to facilitate <b>cross-border</b> <b>purchases.</b> As of today it is simply a merged database consisting of information provided by each national real property register. As a consequence, units of property defined according to different legal definitions are presented as if they were similar, which might cause confusion. We propose that EULIS be accompanied by a single code of European real property law to avoid unnecessary bureaucracy and misunderstanding...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{structure}} of <b>cross-border</b> health <b>purchasing</b> between Austria and Hungary and determines {{the size of this}} phenomenon as well as the barriers to a further increase. Austrian patients may receive health care treatment in Hungary in three different ways. First, patients may receive benefits {{in the context of the}} European Community Regulations 1408 / 71 and 574 / 72 (Category I patients). Second, outside those regulatory structures, Austrian patients travel to Hungary to receive medical treatment, especially dental treatment, and then seek reimbursement from their Austrian insurance (Category II patients). Third, some patients receive medical treatment in Hungary outside both schemes (Category III patients). There are about 42, 500 Category I patients per year; and 58, 000 Category II patients world-wide per year. An unknown but supposedly greater number of patients travel to Hungary to receive mainly dental treatment and cosmetic surgery (Category III). Most health actors in both Austria and Hungary do not regard <b>cross-border</b> <b>purchasing</b> of health services as having cost-saving effects. They put forward major legal, institutional, political, and psychological barriers, which inhibit public and private Austrian providers, to facilitate trade in health care and which inhibit individual patients to realize cost savings through capitalizing on lower health care prices in Hungary. Therefore, for the time being, trade in health care and patient mobility between Austria and Hungary is a circumscribed phenomenon in terms of quantities, and it will most probably remain so in the near future. access to health care; adequate resources; aid; beds; cataract surgery; clinics; Community hospitals; Consumer Protection; cost effectiveness; costs of treatment; dental care; dental treatment; dentists; Diagnosis; discrimination; disease; doctor; doctors; domestic law; employment; entitlement; expenditures; families; financial resources; fundamental principles; general practitioner; Health Affairs; health care; health care centers; health care costs; health care coverage; health care facilities; health care institutions; health care insurance; health care law; health care provider; health care providers; health care sector; health care services; health care standards; health care system; health care systems; Health Care Systems in Transition; health expenditure; health facilities; health insurance; health insurance companies; health insurance funds; health insurance system; health insurers; Health Organization; health organizations; health policy; health providers; health sector; health service; Health Services; health system; health systems; Health Systems in Transition; Healthcare; hospital care; hospital financing; Hospital Operator; hospital sector; hospital treatment; hospitals; hygiene; income; insurance; insurance coverage; insurance systems; Integration; judicial proceedings; legal provisions; marketing; Medical Association; medical associations; medical benefits; medical care; medical facilities; medical science; medical services; medical treatment; medicine; Migration; National Health; National Health Insurance; National Health Insurance Fund; national health policy; nurses; patient; patient care; patient treatment; patients; physician; physicians; Policy ReseaRch; Primary Care; private health insurance; private health insurers; private hospitals; private households; private insurance; private insurer; private insurers; private sector; provision of health care; provision of services; public health; public health care; public health insurance; public hospitals; public sector; quality control; quality of health; quality of health care; rehabilitation; reimbursement rates; right to health care; social health insurance; social insurance; Social Policy; social security; social security schemes; social security systems; surgery; therapy; treatments; Use of Health Care Services; visits; workers...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the cultural-geo-politics of rapprochement tourism between China and Taiwan in the era of warming cross-strait relations. By moving away from state-centric approaches to the study of cross-strait tourism, it interrogates themes surrounding the concepts of ‘border’, ‘identity’ and ‘materiality’, in an attempt to offer a more nuanced understanding of the everyday micro-politics at play. More specifically, the thesis considers different taming strategies engaged by the authorities on both sides in dealing with sensitive histories and difficult heritages, and how their practices are materialised in the tourism landscape. In doing so, this study probes the often assumed processes of rapprochement that result from and animate the cross-border exchanges by providing powerful examples of how tourists respond to attempts to manipulate their opinions, how they interpret ideologically loaded materials {{on both sides of the}} Taiwan Strait, but also of the genuine curiosity and good will that can result. This showcases the everyday experiences of tourists and the various bordering practices they enact and encounter during their travel. Discussions on tourists’ subjectivities show that far from being passive ‘numbers’ or ‘flows’ as often assumed by economic-centric studies, cross-strait tourists are actively shaping the rapprochement landscape. Furthermore, inquiries into the material cultures of memory and identity provide novel insights that go well beyond the state-led ‘peace through tourism’ initiatives to look at how commercial culture is shaping and responding to memories and cross-strait movements. Empirical findings are able to unpack how the border is experienced through a range of artefacts – from border controls to travel documents and <b>cross-border</b> <b>purchases</b> that extend beyond the literal border. Additionally, this research also broadens the sensorium by looking beyond ‘sight’ seeing to incorporate the olfactory, tactile, auditory and gustatory senses in discussing knives made from artillery shells, music events in a defunct military tunnel, and foods offered by local entrepreneurs. Finally, in acknowledging that tourists are not the only subjects of tourism, the thesis examines the roles played by ghosts and deities in their participation of cross-strait rapprochement tourism. In doing this, it demonstrates that rapprochement tourism is more about ‘interactions along the side’ rather than state-level diplomatic exchanges. Forays into consumption practices, identity construction (both national and self), and border (un) making could prove to be significant in the advent of unprecedented tourist exchanges between China and Taiwan...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{contribute}} new empirical results about consumers’ decisions to avoid cigarette excise taxes, {{and a new}} applied welfare economic analysis of optimal excise taxation with tax avoidance. We examine direct measures of consumer excise tax avoidance in novel individual-level data from the 2003 and 2006 - 2007 Tobacco Use Supplements to the U. S. Current Population Survey. We estimate reduced-form models and a structural endogenous switching regression model. In the structural border-crossing equation, the decision {{to cross the border}} depends on the difference between the endogenous home- and border-state prices. The reduced-form and structural results show that the probability of <b>cross-border</b> cigarette <b>purchases</b> responds in predictable ways to the economic incentives created by the distance to the border and state tax differentials. To our knowledge, we are also the first study to extend the formula for optimal Pigouvian corrective taxation to incorporate excise tax avoidance. Taking into account tax avoidance implies the optimal tax is substantially below the simple Pigouvian tax that internalizes external costs. In illustrative calculations for 2003, we find that in 20 states the optimal tax that accounts for tax avoidance is at least 20 percent smaller than the simple Pigouvian tax. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the recent trends in the Japanese cross-border M&A activity in 1988 - 2004 and investigates the factors influencing them. We develop classifications of theoretical foundations and factors of M&A activity and their application for the Japanese case. The article examines two categories of the Japanese M&As - transactions with Japanese companies as a target (sales) and transactions with Japanese companies as an acquirer (purchases). In the Japanese cross-border M&A sales in order to determine factors of changes we look into industrial and institutional structures of M&A transactions. The findings show that beyond the changes in macroeconomic conditions, the recent trends of cross-border M&A sales in Japan were determined mainly by the changes in legislative and corporate environment. For Japanese outward M&A flows we test the standard gravity model. The results show that the volume of the Japanese <b>cross-border</b> M&A <b>purchases</b> is significantly larger in countries with larger and developed markets, a higher degree of investor's protection and a higher liquidity of capital markets.

The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to explore the <b>cross-border</b> acquisitions- <b>purchases</b> and sales- of Finnish engineering consulting firms during the years of 1997 - 2006 in terms of the amount of transactions and the geographical distribution of acquiring and target nations. The focus area of the study- the technical engineering and consulting business- is a significant sub-sector of technology-related knowledge-intensive business services, which have strongly gained the interest of both practitioners and academic researchers in recent years. The methods utilized in this study consisted of literature reviews in the above-mentioned focus areas, the deal analysis of Finnish engineering consultancies on the basis of Thomson ONE Banker database, as well as the use of secondary data such as annual reports and expert opinions for complementing the analysis. The motives and intended effects of acquisitions were studied and compared to literature reviews and general industry characteristics. Results show that product and market extensions are the most significant types of cross-border acquisitions, which is in line with the existing literature. Expansion and other strategic motives can be seen in the study, but in spite of the increased significance of knowledge-intensity and innovativeness in many industries, knowledge acquisition for promoting innovation and R&D capabilities is not so apparent in the motives. Moreover, the geographical distribution in the Finnish sample does not yet clearly indicate a global movement of the industry towards the east. However, the strategies for market extension...|$|R

40|$|Purpose Both, the UK and Japan {{abolished}} {{the tax credit}} system for foreign source dividends in 2009 in favour of the exemption system. With the move towards a dividend exemption system the governments intended to enhance the international tax competitiveness of their countries. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to evaluate the implications of substituting the credit system for the exemption system in the UK and Japan on cross-border transaction prices when competing for international acquisitions. Design/methodology/approach The paper uses an economic model under certainty to analyse the changes in <b>cross-border</b> marginal <b>purchase</b> and seller prices as a result of the introduction of the newly introduced dividend exemption system. Findings Shifting to an exemption system has ambiguous effects on the ability to compete for foreign acquisitions: investors from both countries are able to pay higher prices in the course of acquisitions, but while investors from the UK become more competitive, the relative competitive position for Japanese investors hardly changes and remains relatively constrained, independent of the form of double taxation relief. Thus the author verifies that the international tax regime is not the only determinant influencing the competitive position, ranking second to, e. g., the interaction with international tax rate differentials. Originality/value The international tax reforms in UK and Japan in 2009 offer a unique opportunity to study the impact of international tax policy on the international tax competitiveness of multinational firms in the course of foreign acquisitions. Evidence from this paper is not exclusively applicable to the UK and Japan setting. The observed effects shed new light on the intensified debate in the USA of changing the international tax system by analysing the impact on the bidding situation in international acquisitions in a real-world transition scenario...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{forecasting}} power of international portfolio flows for local equity markets {{and attempt to}} attribute it to either better information about fundamentals {{on the part of}} international investors, or to price pressure. Price pressure is a potential explanation because flows have positive contemporaneous price impacts and are strongly positively autocorrelated. We find that cross-border flows forecast both individual country equity market prices and associated US closed-end country fund prices, even after controlling for closed-end fund <b>purchases.</b> <b>Cross-border</b> flows have no discernable impact on the difference, the closed-end fund discount. This fact is consistent with the information story, which says that cross-border inflows predict no change in the discount, but forecast positive changes in both net asset values and closed-end fund prices. This fact also contradicts the price pressure story, which predicts that cross-border inflows increase local country equity prices, thereby increasing the closed-end fund discount. We also use our approach to test for the presence of trend following in cross-border flows based on relative, as well as absolute returns. Like other studies, we find evidence of trend following based on absolute returns. Interestingly, however, we find also that flows are trend reversing based on relative returns. Flows therefore seem to be stabilizing with respect to notions of relative, but not absolute, value. ...|$|R

In this study, I empirically investigate the announcement effects in stock returns and long-term stock market performance for target firms that represent large share acquisitions by foreign companies. In addition, I test the governance transfer hypothesis which states that target firms usually import the higher quality of shareholder protection of foreign acquirers in a more-protective legal system. This study documents the relationships between stock market performance and legal protection of shareholders' rights by employing a sample of cross-country block purchases, including 240 public target firms from 37 countries, spanning the period from January 1990 to December 2000. I find that the announcement returns for target firms are positive, and they are significantly higher for targets acquired by companies coming from countries {{with higher levels of}} shareholder protection. Interestingly, in the long run, target firms from countries with poor shareholder protection significantly underperform the benchmark, or the local market index. I do not find evidence of cross-border governance transfer in the long run. This study is the first attempt to document both the announcement effects and long-term stock market performance of cross-country block purchases, which are associated with different legal systems and shareholder protection in target and acquiring firms...|$|R
40|$|The {{present state}} of world economy urges {{managers}} to look for new methods, which can help to start the economic growth. To achieve this goal, managers use standard {{as well as new}} procedures. The fundamental prerequisite of the efficient decision-making processes are actual and right information. Managers need to monitor past information and current actual information to generate trends of future development based on it. Managers always should define strictly what do they want to know, how do they want to see it and for what purpose do they want to use it. Only in this case they can get right information applicable to efficient decision-making. Generally, managers´ decisions should lead to make the customers´ decision-making process easier. More frequently than ever, companies use e-commerce systems for the support of their business activities. In connection with the present state and future development, cross-border online shopping growth can be expected. To support this, companies will need much better systems providing the managers adequate and sufficient information. This type of information, which is usually multidimensional, can be provided by the Business Intelligence (BI) technologies. Besides special BI systems, some of BI technologies are obtained in quite a few of ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems. One of the crucial questions is whether should companies and firms buy or develop special BI software, or whether they can use BI tools contained in some ERP systems. In respect of this, there is a question if the modern ERP systems can provide the managers sufficient possibilities relating to ad-hoc reporting, static and dynamic reports and OLAP analyses. A one of the main goals {{of this article is to}} show and verify Business Intelligence tools of Microsoft Dynamics NAV for the support of decision-making in terms of the <b>cross-border</b> online <b>purchasing.</b> Pursuant to above-mentioned, in this article authors deal with problems relating to managers´ decision-making, customers´ decision-making and a support of its using the BI tools contained in ERP system Microsoft Dynamics NAV. A great deal of this article is aimed at area of multidimensional data which are the source data of e-commerce systems. ...|$|R
40|$|The European Commission (EC) {{continues}} {{to move towards}} transforming healthcare in Europe by making use of {{information and communication technologies}} (ICT) to improve the quality and access to healthcare for all European Union (EU) citizens. ICT is seen as the enabler of growth and development in the EU, by facilitating the interoperability of healthcare systems (to enable patient mobility and provide medical services at any place and time) and cross-border commerce. This chapter focuses on the phenomenon of Internet pharmacies and the increasing use of the Internet by EU citizens to obtain pharmaceutical drugs either in their own Member State, in other Member States, or further afield. It discusses the legislative framework regulating the cross-border sale of pharmaceutical drugs within the EU. It argues {{that as a result of}} recent EU regulatory reforms, technological developments, the increasing interoperability of EU healthcare systems, and the increase in use of cross-border medical services and electronic commerce, there may be very little justification for restricting cross-border online prescription drugs sales within the EU. Furthermore, that EU citizens who are at risk from prescription drugs purchased from online sellers located outside the EU, may be best protected by the provision of a safe and open EU online market for all pharmaceutical drugs. The chapter discusses possible measures and legislative reform that could provide a safe and open EU market for online prescription drugs. It ends by advocating for all EU citizens to be allowed the freedom to <b>purchase</b> <b>cross-border</b> online prescription drugs within the EU...|$|R
40|$|Passenger {{car traffic}} between Austria and its {{neighboring}} countries is very intensive; drivers can easily exploit differentials in gasoline prices. In 1994, about 64 million gasoline-powered cars, 11 million diesel-powered cars, 1. 2 million buses, and 3. 2 million trucks entered Austria. These numbers include both Austrian and foreign-owned vehicles. These vehicles constitute {{a potential for}} exploiting price differences of about 1. 2 million tons of gasoline and 1 million tons of diesel fuel, about half of gasoline sales and {{more than two-thirds of}} diesel sales in Austria. About 20 percent of the gasoline and 27 percent of the diesel arbitrage potential is accounted for by Austrian vehicles. During the last 30 years, gasoline sales in Austria have reacted strongly to changes in gasoline price differentials vis-à-vis Germany. If the price in Austria rose by 10 percent relative to that in Germany, sales decreased by 3. 4 percent, ceteris paribus. Increases in fuel prices do bring about a decrease in sales in Austria; but, with prices remaining unchanged abroad, more fuel is imported directly, with the result that overall consumption of fuel declines by a smaller amount. Doubling the mineral oil tax on gasoline in Austria would raise the price of gasoline by 60 percent. On the assumption that prices remain unchanged in Germany and that price differentials vis-à-vis other neighboring countries do not change, domestic sales would drop by 32 percent, revenues from the mineral oil tax would rise by 36 percent, and direct imports of gasoline would soar by 470, 000 tons. Additional expenditures on gasoline by persons driving across the border from Austria to Germany would total ATS 7 billion. Doubling the mineral oil tax on diesel fuel would raise the price of diesel by 50 percent, reduce domestic sales by 20 percent, and increase revenues from the mineral oil tax by 36 percent. Cross-border shopping in Germany would amount to ATS 3. 5 billion. High differentials in fuel prices encourage many people {{in the eastern part of}} Austria to take trips to neighboring countries; such trips not only serve to buy cheap gasoline, but also to shop and visit restaurants. A major part of direct imports from Slovenia, worth some ATS 2 billion, can be attributed directly and indirectly to <b>cross-border</b> gasoline <b>purchases.</b> By contrast, the major incentive to undertake a shopping trip to Hungary, the Slovak and Czech Republics comes from lower prices of tobacco, food, and meals at restaurants.
