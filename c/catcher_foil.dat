5000|$|Some {{problems}} were encountered regarding the theoretically predicted versus the empirically discovered properties of these super-heavy elements. One {{problem was that}} the deduced cross-section of these super-heavy elements was approximately 4 mb, whereas their typical measured cross-sections was about 1 pb, thus creating a difference of 9 orders of magnitude.It has already been shown that deformations have strong effect on the fusion cross-sections; this can explain 4 to 5 orders of magnitude, leaving about 4-5 orders of magnitude in the fusion cross-section to be explained. The answer was found by studying actinides that were separated from the Tungsten target. In the actinide spectra other α particle groups were observed that were impossible to identify with any known activity in the whole nuclear chart and did not fit with the systematic of α - particles; their energies were too low, and they passed the Coulomb barrier too fast. By using a pelletron accelerator and measuring α - γ coincidences from the <b>catcher</b> <b>foil,</b> Marinov and his group found 5.2 MeV α - particle group in coincidence with various γ - rays of σ ≈ 30 nb, which was identified as a transition from 210Fr to 206At; and the reason that it decayed with low energy when much higher energy was available was that it was enhanced by a factor of 3x105. This explained the remaining 5 orders of magnitude, with the conclusion that the 5.2 MeV α - particles decay to a superdeformed band state.In the 1990s Marinov began to search for the existence of super-heavy elements in nature. The assumed existence of long-lived isomeric states has already led to a consistent interpretation of results in the super-heavy region. [...] These isomeric states were observed in Americium and Berkelium nuclei sources separated from a CERN Tungsten target, and were interpreted due to the production of long-lived isomeric states in neutron-deficient 236Am and 236Bk which decay to 236Pu.In order to measure the accurate mass of an atom, a high-resolution mass spectrometer, based on the principle that the mass of any molecule (except for multi-hydrogen molecules) is lower than the mass of an atom with the same mass number, was used in order to separate between the mass of an atom and the masses of molecules of the same mass number was used. Measuring neutron-deficient nuclei from a pure Thorium solution, Marinov discovered that the relative abundance of various Thorium isotopes (211, 213, 217, 218) compared to 232Th is (1 -10)x10−11.If the terrestrial concentration of these isotopes was initially the same as of 232Th, then their half-lives would be >= 108 years. Marinov concluded therefore that long-lived isomeric states with half-lives 1016 to 1022 [...] longer than their corresponding ground states have been found in the neutron-deficient 211,213,217,218Th nuclei.Long-lived isomeric states were also observed in 16O + 197Au reaction at 80 MeV. [...] In this experiment Marinov searched for long-lived isomeric states in pure Gold solution looking for high masses, assuming that if Roentgenium (eka-Gold, element 111) exists in nature it may be found together with Gold. The relative abundance of isotopes 261Rg and 265Rg compared to 197Au was found to be (1-10)x10−10. He therefore assumed that the observed nuclei of atomic mass number A=261 and 265 nuclei were respectively 261Rg and 265Rg (element 111) respectively.Marinov's third experiment consisted of searching for super-heavy elements in Thorium solution at high masses from 287 to 294, looking for super-actinide nuclei. According to Seaborg's extended periodic table of elements, elements 122 and 124 are placed as eka-Thorium and eka-Uranium respectively. It was discovered that nuclei of atomic mass A=292 are in abundance of (1-10)x10−12 (relative to 232Th), and have a half-life which is >= 108 years. Since the predicted half-lives of nuclei around 292122 is 10−6 to 10−8 seconds, and the empirically measured half-lives of these nuclei is >= 108 years, Marinov concluded that this was an isomeric state in the nucleus of atomic mass A=292 and atomic number Z~=122.Thus, the discovery of long-lived high spin isomeric states in the second minimum (the super-deformed minimum) and in the third minimum (the hyper-deformed minimum) of the potential energy of nuclei when displayed as a function of deformation, and the fact that these isomeric states have unusual radioactive decay properties and much longer lifetimes than their corresponding ground states, have led Marinov to his recent discovery of evidence for a long-lived super-heavy nucleus with atomic mass number A=292 and atomic number Z~=122 in natural Thorium.|$|E

In other careful experiments conducted over a period of many months they find that they are unable to confirm the element 102 discovery work of Fields et al. reported in 1957. The experiments at Berkeley were performed with the new heavy ion linear accelerator (HILAC) {{over a period of several}} weeks and culinated the chemical identification of an isotope of fermium (Fm{sup 250 }) as the daughter of an alpha-particle-emitting isotope of element 102 (102 {sup 254 }). The method used to detect the isotope of element 102 was essentially a continuous milking experiment wherein the atoms of the daughter element 100 were separated from the parent element 102 by taking advantage of the recoil due to the element 102 alpha particle decay. The target consisted of a mixture of isotopes of curium (95 % Cm{sup 244 } and 4. 5 % Cm{sup 246 }) mounted on a very thin nickel foil. The target was approximately 0. 5 mg/cm{sup 2 } thick and was covered with 75 {micro}gm/cm{sup 2 } aluminum to prevent curium 'knockover'. The curium was bombarded with mono-energetic C{sup 12 } ions at energies from 60 to 100 Mev. The transmuted atoms were knocked into helium gas to absorb the considerable recoil energy. It was found that with a sufficient electric field strength practically all of these positively charged atoms could be attracted to a moving negatively charged metallic belt placed directly beneath the target. These atoms would then be carried on this conveyer belt under a foil which was charged negatively relative to the belt. Approximately half of the atoms undergoing alpha decay would cause their daughter atoms to recoil from the surface of the belt to the <b>catcher</b> <b>foil.</b> The <b>catcher</b> <b>foil</b> was cut transversely to the direction of the belt motion into five equal length sections after a time of bombardement suited to the half-life of the daughter atom to be examined.

With this equipment it was easily possible to make all the desired measurements for identifying the atoms caught on the catcher foils and thus to measure the half-life of the parent of the recoiling atoms. The method was first successfully used in bombardments of Pu{sup 240 } with C{sup 12 } ions to identify a new isotope of element 100, Fm{sup 248 }.

Hot fusion reactions were studied with the MG system, <b>catcher</b> <b>foil</b> techniques and the Berkeley Gas-filled Separator (BGS). 3 n- and 4 n-exit channel production cross sections were obtained for the {sup 238 }U({sup 18 }O,xn) {sup 256 -x}Fm, {sup 238 }U({sup 22 }Ne,xn) {sup 260 -x}No, and {sup 248 }Cm({sup 15 }N,xn) {sup 263 -x}Lr reactions and are similar to previous experimental results. The experimental cross sections were accurately modeled by the predictions of the HIVAP code using the Reisdorf and Schaedel parameters and are consistent with the existing systematics of 4 n exit channel reaction products. Cold fusion reactions were examined using the BGS. The {sup 208 }Pb({sup 48 }Ca,xn) {sup 256 -x}No, {sup 208 }Pb({sup 50 }Ti,xn) {sup 258 -x}Rf, {sup 208 }Pb({sup 51 }V,xn) {sup 259 -x}Db, {sup 209 }Bi({sup 50 }Ti,xn) {sup 259 -x}Db, and {sup 209 }Bi({sup 51 }V,xn) {sup 260 -x}Sg reactions were studied. The experimental production cross sections are in agreement with the results observed in previous experiments. It was necessary to slightly alter the Reisdorf and Schaedel parameters for use in the HIVAP code in order to more accurately model the experimental data.

40|$|The heavy-ion induced {{reactions}} on intermediate mass {{targets are}} complex in nature, {{even at the}} low energies. To understand those nuclear reaction phenomena in detail, more experimental studies are required {{in a wide range}} of energy. Heavy-ion reactions were investigated by measuring production cross sections of the residues produced in the ^ 11 B-induced reactions on ^ 89 Y and ^ 93 Nb at low energies, near and above the barrier, and to check the effectiveness of the different nuclear models to explain them. Further, aim is also to optimize the production parameters of neutron deficient medically relevant ^ 97 Ru and ^ 101 mRh radioisotopes produced in those reactions, respectively. The ^ 11 B-beam was allowed to impinge on ^ 89 Y and ^ 93 Nb foils supported by an aluminum <b>catcher</b> <b>foil,</b> arranged in a stack, in 27. 5 - 58. 7 and 30. 6 - 62. 3 MeV energy range, respectively. The γ-spectrometry was carried out after EOB to measure the activity of the radionuclides produced in each foil and cross sections were calculated. Measured cross-sectional data were analyzed in terms of compound and precompound model calculations. The measured cross sections of the residues showed good agreement with the model calculations based on the Hauser-Feshbach formulation and exciton model. A substantial preequilibrium contribution was noticed in the 3 n reaction channel in both the reactions. Theoretical estimations confirmed that major production yields are mostly contributed by the compound reaction process. Preequilibrium emissions contributed at the high energy tail of the 3 n channel for both the reactions. Moreover, an indirect signature of a direct reaction influence was also observed in the ^ 90 mY production. Comment: 30 pages, 18 figures, Phys Rev C, 201...|$|E
40|$|We {{measured}} the beta-delayed alpha-particle emission spectrum of 16 N with a sensitivity for beta-decay branching ratios {{of the order}} of 10 - 10. The 16 N nuclei were produced using the d(15 N, 16 N) p reaction with 70 MeV 15 N beams and a deuterium gas target 7. 5 cm long at a pressure of 1250 torr. The 16 N nuclei were collected (over 10 s) using a thin aluminum foil with an areal density of 180 mu g/cm 2 tilted at 7 Deg with respect to the beam. The activity was transferred to the counting area by means of a stepping motor in less than 3 s with the counting carried out over 8 s. The beta-delayed alpha-particles were measured using a time of flight method to achieve a sufficiently low background. Standard calibration sources (148 Gd, 241 Am, 208, 209 Po, and 227 Ac) as well as alpha-particles and 7 Li from the 10 B(n,alpha) 7 Li reaction were used for an accurate energy calibration. The energy resolution of the <b>catcher</b> <b>foil</b> (180 - 220 keV) was calculated and the time of flight resolution (3 - 10 nsec) was measured using the beta-delayed alpha-particle emission from 8 Li that was produced using the d(7 Li, 8 Li) p reaction with the same setup. The line shape was corrected to account for the variation in the energy and time resolution and a high statistics spectrum of the beta-delayed alpha-particle emission of 16 N is reported. However, our data (as well as earlier Mainz data and unpublished Seattle data) do not agree with an earlier measurement of the beta-delayed alpha-particle emission of 16 N taken at TRIUMF after averaging over the energy resolution of our collection system. This disagreement, amongst other issues, prohibits accurate inclusion of the f-wave component in the R-matrix analysis.

40|$|We have {{determined}} the recoil range of spallation xenon produced by irradiation of Ba glass targets with approximatly 1190 and approximatly 268 MeV protons, using a catcher technique, where spallation products are measured in target and <b>catcher</b> <b>foils.</b> The inferred range for (sup 126) Xe produced in silicon carbide is approximatly 0. 19 µm, which implies retention of approximatly 70 % for (sup 126) Xe produced in "typical" presolar silicon carbide grains of 1 µm size. Recoil loss of spallation xenon poses a significantly smaller problem than {{loss of the}} spallation neon from SiC grains. Ranges differ for the various Xe isotopes and scale approximately linearly as function of the mass difference between the target element, Ba, and the product. As a consequence, SiC grains of various sizes will have differences in spallation Xe composition. In an additional experiment at approximatly 66 MeV, where the recoil ranges of (sup 22) Na and (sup 127) Xe produced on Ba glass were determined using gamma-spectrometry, we found no evidence for recoil ranges being systematically different at this lower energy. We have used the new data to put constraints on the possible presolar age of the SiC grains analyzed for Xe by Lewis et al. (1994). Uncertainties {{in the composition of}} the approximately normal Xe component in SiC (Xe-N) constitute the most serious problem in determining an age, surpassing remaining uncertainties in Xe retention and production rate. A possible interpretation is that spallation contributions are negligible and that trapped (sup 124) Xe/(sup 126) Xe is approximatly 5 % lower in Xe-N than in Q-Xe. But also for other reasonable assumptions for the (sup 124) Xe/(sup 126) Xe ratio in Xe-N (e. g., as in Q-Xe), inferred exposure ages are considerably shorter than theoretically expected lifetimes for interstellar grains. A short presolar age is in line with observations by others (appearance, grain size distribution) that indicate little processing in the interstellar medium (ISM) of surviving (crystalline) SiC. This may be due to amorphization of SiC in the ISM on a much shorter time scale than destruction, with amorphous SiC not surviving processing in the early solar system. A large supply of relatively young grains may be connected to the proposed starburst origin (Clayton 2003) for the parent stars of the mainstream SiC grains...|$|R
40|$|In many {{score of}} {{experiments}} conducted {{in various ways}} {{over a period of}} many months they find that they are unable to confirm the element 102 discovery work of Fields et al. reported in 1957. These experimenters ascribed to an isotope of element 102 an alpha particle activity having an energy of 8. 5 {+-} 0. 1 Mev and a half-life of approximately 10 minutes. It was reported to be produced by bombardments of a 1 mg/cm{sup 2 } curium target with 0. 03 - 0. 10 mter-microamperes of C{sup 13 } ions of about 90 Mev energy in the internal beam of the Nobel Institute 225 cm cyclotron. Our attempts to reproduce this activity were made with the monoenergetic ion beam available from the Berkeley heavy ion linear accelerator (HILAC). Curium with a similar isotopic composition was used, except that instead of one target they used six separate electroplated targets, four with 0. 4 mg/cm{sup 2 } curium and two with 0. 1 mg/cm{sup 2 } curium. These were mounted in vacuum so that the heavy ion beam could pass through and knock the transmutation recoils into 0. 9 mg/cm{sup 2 } palladium foils. After a suitable bombardment the six <b>catcher</b> <b>foils</b> were dissolved in a few drops of concentrated aqua regia and an actinide element fraction quickly separated from palladium by elution with 2 M HCl from a column packed with Dowex- 1 anion exchange resin. It was possible to examine a trans-plutonium fraction within 8 minutes from the end of bombardment. A wide range of energies (60 - 100 Mev) of both C{sup 12 } and C{sup 13 } projectiles and (+ 6) ion currents up to 0. 2 microamperes were used. In order to compare these bombardments with those which were reported to have produced the 8. 5 Mev alpha activity one can compare the amounts of the other alpha particle activities that are produced in such bombardments. The nuclides Fm{sup 250 }, Cf{sup 245 }, Cr{sup 244 }, and Cf{sup 246 } were found in far greater amount in the experiments than in the aforementioned cyclotron runs. In the case of Cf{sup 246 }, for example, which is produced with a relatively flat excitation function they found in a typical experiment about 40 alpha counts per minute. This should be compared with 0. 1 alpha counts per minute of Cf{sup 246 } found in the cyclotron experiment which was reported to have yielded four 8. 5 Mev events...|$|R
40|$|Patients {{with primary}} breast, {{prostate}} and lung cancer {{have a high}} frequency of bone metastases, ranging from 65 % to 85 %. Pain palliation in patients suffering from an advanced stage disease is a relevant practice to achieve {{a better quality of}} life. For this purpose bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals are used in the treatment of painful bone metastases for which conventional therapies have failed. Rhenium- 186 g is used as labelling agent due to its favourable chemical and nuclear properties: T 1 / 2 = 89. 4 h, main gamma emission at 137 keV and beta particle of end point energies at 1. 07 and 0. 93 MeV, suitable for small-medium volume irradiation. It is used as a labelling agent of HEDP for bone pain palliation and is also envisaged for labelling of oligopeptides. Presently 186 gRe is produced by neutron capture on enriched 185 Re in thermal nuclear reactors (together with its long-lived metastable level 186 mRe), with a specific activity (AS) of the order of 1 - 2 MBq/micro. g, depending on target enrichment and irradiation conditions, thus with an isotope dilution factor IDF of 3, 000 to 5, 000. The possibility to use this radionuclide for therapeutic purposes is strictly linked to the possibility of increasing further the AS. The goal is to obtain a high AS 186 Re in no-carrier-added NCA form by (p,n) or (d, 2 n) nuclear reactions on a tungsten target of natural or enriched (in 186 W) isotopic composition. Irradiations were carried out with the Scanditronix MC 40 Cyclotron (K= 40) of the Joint Research Centre (Ispra, Italy). 186 gRe was produced by proton induced nuclear reactions on commercially available thin natural tungsten foils using the stacked foil technique at different irradiation energies, in which W foils are activated together with Al thin <b>foils</b> as recoil <b>catchers</b> and Ti <b>foils</b> as monitors. The activity of the irradiated target foils was measured using HPGe detectors associated with appropriate gamma spectrometry systems and softwares. The cross-section data obtained for the natW(p,n) 186 (g+m) Re and 181, 182 m,g, 183, 184 m,gRe reactions are reported, and compared both with literature values and the model calculation by the code EMPIRE-II of NEA-OECD agency, with which they appear to be in reasonable agreement. The irradiation of natural W target implies the production of a large amount of rhenium radioisotopes, also including stable ones. For radiochemical separation purposes, a radiochromatographic technique based on an acidic alumina mini-column in nitric acid was adopted. JRC. I. 4 -Nanotechnology and Molecular Imagin...|$|R
40|$|Light neutron-rich nuclei {{provide an}} {{excellent}} opportunity to study the changes in nuclear shell structure that occur with increasing neutron number and are an important testing ground for shell model theories. Probably {{one of the most}} striking examples of shell modification is the occurrence of intruder ground states, which signal an inversion of the normal shell ordering. Intruder ground states are observed around {sup 32 }Mg (Z= 10 - 12), ''the island of inversion'', and in {sup 11 }Be. An analogous situation appears in the Z= 2 He isotopes, where the intrusion of sd excitations in p-shell configurations becomes important in the heavy helium isotopes. Finally, for Z= 8, recent data on {sup 20 }O [1] show a reduction in the p-sd shell gap with increasing neutron number. It remains an open question whether the observed diminishing of the p-sd shell gap is restricted to O and F isotopes or extends also to neighboring nuclei. Here, we report preliminary results on {sup 18 }N (Z= 7), which is sufficiently far from stability to exhibit modified shell structure and yet still within the reach of stable beam facilities utilizing state-of-the art detector systems. {sup 18 }N was produced in the {sup 9 }Be({sup 11 }B, 2 p) {sup 18 }N reaction at the 88 '' Cyclotron at LBNL and studied using the LIBERACE-STARS detector array [...] an array of large area segmented silicon detectors (E-{Delta}E) and six HPGe Clover detectors. This experiment was the first to use a fusion-evaporation reaction to populate {sup 18 }N. Previous information on the excited states of 18 N came from {sup 18 }C beta-decay [2] and charge-exchange reactions [3]. These are highly selective reactions and the fusion-evaporation reaction used here can provide a more comprehensive picture of the excitation spectrum. The beam energy of 50 MeV was chosen to optimize the cross section for the evaporation of 2 protons while simultaneously suppressing the evaporation of additional neutrons in conjunction with the 2 p channel. The two proton tag cleanly selects the weak (sub milli-barn) {sup 18 }N products.
