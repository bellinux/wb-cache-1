5000|$|The {{slipperiness}} and smoothness {{of sheer}} pantyhose and stockings also makes women's low cut <b>court</b> <b>shoes</b> slip off more easily.

5000|$|Fashion advice also {{centers around}} the amount of {{appropriate}} toe cleavage. A pump (<b>court</b> <b>shoe)</b> with a [...] "slightly low vamp for a hint of toe cleavage" [...] should not be [...] "too racy for a conservative office".

25|$|Boots, {{typically}} Hessian {{boots with}} heart-shaped tops and tassels were mainstay in men's footwear. After the Duke of Wellington defeated Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815, Wellington boots, {{as they were}} known, became the rage; tops were knee-high in front and cut lower in back. The jockey boot, with a turned-down cuff of lighter colored leather, had previously been popular but continued to be worn for riding. <b>Court</b> <b>shoes</b> with elevated heels became popular {{with the introduction of}} trousers.|$|R
5|$|In 1986, Sindy {{manufacturers}} {{took advantage}} of new colour-changing technology and released Magic Moments Sindy, a doll whose hair and swimming costume changed colour when immersed in warm water. Sindy's senior designer Jane Braithwaite travelled to Paris each month to research fashion trends for Sindy's clothing {{in an attempt to}} reverse declining sales. As an example of Sindy's continually updated fashions, during this period the doll's footwear included kitten heels, sandals, knee-high boots, ankle boots, trainers, slippers, <b>court</b> <b>shoes</b> and slingbacks.|$|R

This was worn with ordinary dress shirt, collar, white bow tie, and opera hat.|$|R
25|$|High-heeled {{footwear}} (often abbreviated as {{high heels}} or simply heels) is footwear {{that raises the}} heel of the wearer's foot {{significantly higher than the}} toes. When both the heel and the toes are raised equal amounts, as in a platform shoe, it is technically not considered to be a high heel; however, there are also high-heeled platform shoes. High heels tend to give the aesthetic illusion of longer, more slender legs. High heels come {{in a wide variety of}} styles, and the heels are found in many different shapes, including stiletto, pump (<b>court</b> <b>shoe),</b> block, tapered, blade, and wedge.|$|R
2500|$|Today, {{high heels}} are {{typically}} worn with heights varying from a kitten heel of [...] to a stiletto heel (or spike heel) of [...] or more.

The wedge heel is informally another style of the heel, where the heel is in a wedge form and continues {{all the way to}} the toe of the shoe.|$|R

50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1908. Converse has been a {{subsidiary}} of Nike, Inc. since 2003. The company lost a huge monopoly after other companies presented their own styles, but Converse rebounded and changed the targeted audience. During World War II, the company shifted its manufacturing from the public, and instead made them for the military. It {{was one of the}} few producers of athletic shoes and for over a half century the company dominated the American <b>court</b> <b>shoe</b> market. Converse shoes are distinguished by a number of features, including; the company's star insignia, the All Star's rubber sole, smooth rounded toe, and wrap-around strip that have become extremely distinguishable internationally.|$|R
50|$|Tires {{are also}} often {{recycled}} {{for use on}} basketball <b>courts</b> and new <b>shoe</b> products.|$|R
25|$|Ballroom shoes {{fall into}} two categories: Ballroom and Latin American. Both are characterised by suede soles. Men's ballroom shoes are {{typically}} lace-ups with one-inch heels and patent leather uppers. Ladies' ballroom <b>shoes</b> are typically <b>court</b> <b>shoes</b> with two-inch heels, made of fabric that can be colored to match the dancer's dress. In contrast to the low Ballroom heel, which evenly distributes weight across the foot, Latin American shoes have higher heels designed to shift weight onto the toes. Latin shoes are also more flexible than ballroom shoes. Men's Latin shoes typically have 1.5- to 2-inch high, shaped heels, while Ladies' Latin shoes have 2,5-inch to 3-inch heels. Ladies shoes are typically open-toed and strapped.|$|R
2500|$|For {{ceremonial}} occasions, Queen's Counsel wear black breeches {{and black}} stockings instead of trousers, and patent leather <b>court</b> <b>shoes</b> with buckles. They {{wear the same}} black frock coat and waistcoat worn when appearing in court (never the [...] "bum freezer", however) but add lace at the wrists and also a lace stock at the collar. Bands are no longer worn at the collar {{in addition to the}} lace, and the winged collar is also dispensed with. They have white cotton gloves, but these are invariably carried and not worn. This part of their ceremonial dress is taken from the standard ceremonial dress worn at the Royal Court (as opposed to the Courts of Justice) by other courtiers.|$|R
50|$|In {{full dress}} the coatee's chest, back, tails back and front, collar, cuffs and pocket flaps were all {{decorated}} with gold oak-leaf embroidery. It was fastened by hooks and eyes, with dummy buttons bearing the Royal {{coat of arms}} of the United Kingdom (nine buttons up the front, showing between the two embroidered edges two at the waist behind, two {{at the bottom of}} back skirts). The coatee had white silk linings, and was worn with white breeches, white gloves, and patent leather <b>court</b> <b>shoes</b> with gilt buckles. The sword had black scabbard, gilt mountings, and sword knot of gold lace strap with bullion tassel; it was worn on a sword belt of white web, with white cloth frog.|$|R
50|$|Senior Counsel are {{appointed}} {{annually in the}} Call to the Inner Bar, a short ceremony in the Supreme Court {{towards the end of}} Michaelmas term. (Junior counsel are members of the Outer or Utter Bar.) On this occasion alone do the new Senior Counsel wear full-bottomed wigs, though with their working robes rather than with the breeches, stockings, patent <b>court</b> <b>shoes</b> and lace stock of former times. This is purely a matter of convention and is not, so it would seem, governed by any rule of court. Since 1922, the Chief Justice has presided over the ceremony in lieu of the departed Lord Chancellor. None has seen fit to alter the manner of the Call.|$|R
