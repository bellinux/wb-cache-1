The Imperial ambassador, Jehan de Scheyfye, {{had been}} {{convinced}} {{for years that}} Dudley was engaged in some [...] "mighty plot" [...] to settle the Crown on his own head. As late as 12 June, though, he still knew nothing specific, despite having inside information about Edward's sickness. France, which found {{the prospect of the}} Emperor's cousin on the English throne disagreeable, gave indications of support to Northumberland. Since the Duke did not rule out an armed intervention from Charles V, he came back on the French offer after the King's death, sending a secret and non-committal mission to King Henry II. After Jane's accession in July the ambassadors of both powers were convinced she would prevail, although they were in no doubt that the common people backed Mary. Antoine de Noailles wrote of Guildford Dudley as [...] "the new King", while the Emperor instructed his envoys to arrange themselves with the Duke and to discourage Mary from undertaking anything dangerous.|$|E

On her deathbed she told her sobbing husband to remarry, to which he replied, [...] "Non, j'aurai des maîtresses!" [...] (French for [...] "No, I shall have mistresses!"). It was <b>common</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> George had already had mistresses during his marriage, and he had kept Caroline informed about them. Henrietta Howard, later Countess of Suffolk, had moved to Hanover with her husband during the reign of Queen Anne, and she had been one of Caroline's women of the bedchamber. She was his mistress from before the accession of George I until November 1734. She was followed by Amalie von Wallmoden, later Countess of Yarmouth, whose son, Johann Ludwig von Wallmoden, may have been fathered by George. Johann Ludwig was born while Amalie was still married to her husband, and George did not acknowledge him publicly as his own son.|$|E

After that, {{he was free to}} embark on a new career as an actor-manager. In partnership with Binkie Beaumont he staged the English premiere of Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire, with Leigh in the central role of Blanche DuBois. The play was condemned by most critics, but the production was a considerable commercial success, and led to Leigh's casting as Blanche in the 1951 film version. Gielgud, who was a devoted friend of Leigh's, doubted whether Olivier was wise to let her play the demanding role of the mentally unstable heroine: [...] " [...] was so very like her, in a way.

In ECW, however, he was clearly heard speaking in the ring on several occasions and it was fairly <b>common</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> Brunk was an American citizen from birth.

2500|$|The {{iterated}} elimination (or deletion) of dominated strategies is {{one common}} technique for solving games that involves iteratively removing dominated strategies. [...] In the first step, at most one dominated strategy {{is removed from}} the strategy space of each of the players since no rational player would ever play these strategies. This results in a new, smaller game. [...] Some strategiesthat were not dominated beforemay be dominated in the smaller game. [...] The first step is repeated, creating a new even smaller game, and so on. The process stops when no dominated strategy is found for any player. This process is valid since it is assumed that rationality among players is <b>common</b> <b>knowledge,</b> <b>that</b> is, each player knows {{that the rest of the}} players are rational, and each player knows that the rest of the players know that he knows that the rest of the players are rational, and so on ad infinitum (see Aumann, 1976).|$|E

However, this term has been broadly interpreted. Two major issues must be addressed: (1) What mental state corresponds to <b>common</b> <b>knowledge,</b> i. e., is knowledge, belief or supposition the appropriate mental attitude? (2) What inference process allows agents to achieve <b>common</b> <b>knowledge?</b> Most generally, <b>common</b> <b>knowledge</b> is used to describe the <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> is evidenced in reflexive reasoning. The term has also been used to refer to facts or objects which are mutually salient. One of the main problems for a theory of <b>common</b> <b>knowledge</b> is whether knowledge is the appropriate mental attitude. It seems as though probabilistic beliefs might approximate the cognitive phenomenon of <b>common</b> <b>knowledge</b> more closely than knowledge. The main problem with a usable notion of <b>common</b> <b>knowledge</b> is <b>that</b> inference must {{play a critical role in}} what becomes <b>common</b> <b>knowledge.</b> I discuss the nature of conversational inference. It has a number of properties that distinguish it from other inferential systems, such as being apparently abductive and probabilistic, but a precise characterization of it is an unsolved problem. I suggest that in cases where ensuring <b>common</b> <b>knowledge</b> really matters, participants in dialogue accomplish this is by exploiting opportunities for redundancy in conversation...|$|R
