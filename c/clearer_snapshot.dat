40|$|This {{paper will}} discuss the Global Educational Network for Satellite Operators (GENSO) project, a {{software}} package for groundstation computers which aims to drastically increase a satellites availability to control operators. This project will achieve this goal by connecting many different groundstations together via the internet, so a person in North America can use a groundstation in Europe to communicate with a satellite. This International project is sponsored by ISEB and largely managed and funded by ESA. There are numerous benefits to the Amateur Radio community, including motivating an entirely new generation of amateur satellite operators, more control options for AMSAT satellites, and a <b>clearer</b> <b>snapshot</b> of satellite health. Frequency usage and coordination will be discussed and the opportunities for individual amateurs {{to become part of}} the network will be explained. While these first versions of the GENSO software package will support digital modes on VHF, UHF, and S-band, there are no restrictions on satellite frequencies and/or modes that can be passed over the network. Satellite builders would only need to distribute software drivers to groundstations. Future versions of this program will include streaming audio, orbital element calculation, and live internet chat. ...|$|E

The general consensus is that projected increases in temperature will render British dwellings vulnerable to summer overheating and by the middle of this century it may become difficult to maintain a comfortable indoor environment, if adaptation measures are not well integrated in the design and operation of new dwellings, which are likely to remain in use beyond the 2050 s. The challenge is to reduce overheating risks by integrating building and user adaptation measures, to avoid energy intensive mechanical cooling. Developing guidelines and updating building regulations for adaptation, therefore, requires an understanding of the baseline scenario; i. e. the performance of existing buildings in future climates. This paper aims to investigate the performance of new-build multi-occupancy British dwellings for human thermal comfort in the present-day and projected future climates in four regional cities: Birmingham, Edinburgh, London and Manchester. Evaluations are carried out by a series of dynamic thermal simulations using widely adopted threshold temperature for overheating, as well as adaptive thermal comfort standards. This study thus offers a unique perspective on regional variations of performance and provides a <b>clearer</b> <b>snapshot</b> because of the use of more appropriate adaptive comfort standards in the evaluations. Finally, the paper sheds light on possible personal and building adaptation measures to alleviate overheating risks...|$|E

The early Middle Ages brings a surprisingly <b>clear</b> <b>snapshot</b> of the European gardening situation {{at the time of}} Charlemagne with the survival of three important documentations: the Capitulare de villis, Walafrid Strabo's poem Hortulus, and the plan of St Gall which depicts three garden areas and lists what was grown.|$|R

His writings reflect tensions within Christianity as it struggled to become a more organized and structured movement.

5000|$|Today a {{great deal}} is learned about Kraak ware through {{excavation}} of shipwrecks by marine archaeologists. Because the wreck can usually be dated {{with some degree of}} certainty, its contents provides a <b>clear</b> <b>snapshot</b> of production at the moment the vessel went down. Moreover, its location can also indicate its destination point, thus revealing much about international trade routes and outposts at the time. [...] In contrast to the other major European imports of the time (for example textiles or spices), ceramics are able to withstand exposure to water, thus making it the ideal merchandise to serve as ballast cargo in the great ships. [...] Yet from another perspective, porcelain's durability in this sense, even withstanding centuries of submersion {{at the bottom of the}} sea, means that it has been the good that has endured (sometimes even intact) to tell these tales.|$|R
40|$|Economic {{well-being}} {{has been}} an issue relevant to American public discourse {{for some time and}} has become a topic of particular interest among journalists, policymakers, and ordinary American families. The Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE) is often used as a tool to analyze the effects of economic well-being. Though the Census Bureau independently collects and processes income data—the CE is the only Federal survey that collects information on income, expenditures, and associated demographic characteristics from U. S. consumers. As a result, CE data are useful for answering many salient questions related to economic well-being. However, CE data are also complex and should be used with an understanding of the limitations of these data. This Beyond the Numbers article examines assumptions users often make regarding how the CE measures household wealth, by providing examples of the nuances in the data and composition of five household groupings. The examples provide a <b>clearer</b> <b>snapshot</b> of economic well-being found in the income quintiles. The article uses tabulations of households by quintiles of income before taxes that many researchers use to identify the “poor” and the “rich” in the CE data. These terms are subjective and potentially pejorative. Another common set of terms for these types of analyses are “low-income” and “high-income. ” These are also subjective terms, and they are imprecise for communicating the concept of economic well-being, which involves other measures of wealth (e. g. stocks, bonds, cash assets, etc.). Misunderstandings arise potentially when researchers use terms like “rich” and “poor” to describe households rather than focus solely on income measures. So, what are the common assumptions made about the economic well-being of the “poor” and “rich” when using CE data to compare income groups...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe next man up slogan may be acceptable for competitive sports, {{but it seems}} more likely to characterize negligence when placed {{in the context of}} the potential life-and-death outcomes facing the members of a military organization. This research questions whether the Marine Corps’ manning and staffing policies are adequately setting the conditions for infantry battalions to achieve optimal readiness prior to deployment. The <b>clearest</b> <b>snapshot</b> of an infantry battalion’s readiness is displayed during the unit’s mission rehearsal exercise. According to this research, the Marine Corps manning and staffing policies accomplish the commandant’s guidance, but the results from the models in this study identify weaknesses in current policy metrics. In fact, the Marine Corps manpower process is underperforming the task of stabilizing infantry battalions prior to deployment. The resulting effect is a negative contribution toward unit cohesion and readiness. This study recommends including a stability metric in the current readiness model, adjusting the staffing window, and prioritizing the staffing of the statistically significant unit groups identified in this study. The Marine Corps can improve the readiness of infantry battalions by modifying the manning and staffing policy guidelines and enforcing the initiative known as the Deployed Unit Staffing Cohesion policy. Major, United States Marine Corp...|$|R
40|$|The article {{examines}} the expositions of the Aldan Maadyr National Museum, Republic of Tuva (previously known as the Tuva Regional Museum), focusing on {{the changes in the}} region during the existence of Tuva Autonomous Oblast (1940 s- 1950 s). The author analyzes the exhibition plans written by the museum personnel, which reveals the specifics of the museum work in Tuva and how it featured the national impetus of building Socialism. The Tuvan museum was required to actively promote the achievements of the best industrial enterprises, collective farms, best workers and cultural projects. The exhibits had to present a vivid image of the new society and a <b>clear</b> <b>snapshot</b> of the historical period. To stand up to the task, the museum went through a number of reforms, including setting up a new department of Socialist period in 1947. The permanent exhibits unavoidably featured copies of documents of the Soviet state, thematic materials on the life and work of V. I. Lenin and I. V. Stalin, on the rise of the Soviet power, its {{role in the development of}} Tuvan agriculture, electrification, and the improvements in education, medicine and culture. The articles provides economic data, lists of the best enterprises and workers in the region, and other useful information, illustrate by the photos preserved in the archives of the Aldan Maadyr Aldan Maadyr National Museum, Republic of Tuva...|$|R
40|$|The works {{presented}} here constitute {{an examination of}} the impact of new media technologies (focusing on social media) on the practice of journalism, with an emphasis on integrating empirical and sociological research. The use of a combination of content analysis, interviews and personal reflections and columns by journalists, case studies and observations, serves to verify and triangulate the evidence. The use of a comprehensive model to examine and analyse media products is a substantial contribution to the field of journalism studies. Previous studies that focused on new media technologies tended to either simply describe these technologies and their potential for change, or to analyse them purely in relationship to older technologies and processes, reducing both forms of practice to a tautological definition: each is that which the other is not. Taking a <b>clear</b> <b>snapshot</b> of the current landscape, and examining it without reference to specific technologies or past practices, the model allows for clear examination of relationships and practices, without being limited by the previous analyses. A number of key themes emerge from research: the tension between the potential of new technologies to expand and improve journalistic practice and output is countered by the fear that the technology will render journalists and their practices redundant. The impact of economic forces is also apparent in the research. The economic structures that underpin journalism were undergoing substantial changes as new media was introduced, and have undergone additional changes {{as a result of the}} social and usage changes that technology has wrought. Technology cannot be abstracted from society and economics, and this interrelationship is apparent in the development of the model of the new media ecology which we developed. The work expands on ideas of the first wave of sociological research into the practice of journalism, taking the methods and ideas and applying them to current environments. The iterative development of a model for the new media environments, and its application to empirical and observed research is a key contribution to the field...|$|R
30|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} within the joint project NiddaMan, which focused on diagnosis of ecosystem health in the catchment of the Nidda River in Hesse, Germany, as a scientific basis for river management. The Nidda catchment, including the Nidda River and its tributaries Horloff and Usa, {{can be regarded as}} a model for medium-sized stream systems influenced by intense industrial and agricultural activity in modern industrialised countries. With regard to the European Water Framework Directive (2000 / 60 /EC) surface waters were supposed to be in a good ecological state until 2015. As it is well-known, however, that many of those German water bodies had fallen far short of this goal, therefore, the stated period was prolonged until 2027. In Germany, only 7.9 % of surface waters achieved a ‘good’ and just 0.3 % a ‘very good’ ecological state at the first deadline in 2015 [1]. The ecological status assessment is based on two main pillars: physicochemical parameters and biological monitoring. Physicochemical parameters can be measured continuously with relatively little effort. Data obtained are collated with existing environmental quality standards (EQS) but also may contribute to deriving new EQS for substances uncovered, yet. The clearest shortcoming of chemical analyses is that only substances tested for can be detected and quantified. But thousands of substances enter our waterbodies on a daily basis, and in the European Union alone, thousands of new ones are registered in REACH [Regulation (EC) No. 1907 / 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals] every year. Thus, analyses of chemical compounds in surface waters are restricted to lead substances that can only give a scattered picture of the actual situation. Biological monitoring, in contrast, offers a <b>clear</b> <b>snapshot</b> of the situation in reality, but is time consuming and cost-intensive. Therefore, biomonitoring is conducted less frequently including a lower number of investigated sites. But even if biomonitoring is repeated in shorter intervals at more sites, the context between chemical measurements and status quo of biota in the field will still be lacking. Effect-based bioassays and biomarker are able to bridge that gap because they reflect the ecotoxicological potential of the studied system, may be conducted on different levels (cells, organs, organisms) and are financially feasible. As a consequence, the idea of complementing the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) with additional biotests gains proponents in the scientific community, in recent years (e.g. [2 – 5]).|$|R
