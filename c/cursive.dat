5|$|The <b>cursive</b> {{form of the}} Deseret {{alphabet}} {{was mainly}} used by two people: George D. Watt, and James Henry Martineau. Watt, a stenographer, recorded several bishops meetings and wrote other personal documents in this <b>cursive</b> style. A chart of the <b>cursive</b> form appears below. The blue glyphs represent how to write each character, while the top row of printed glyphs shows the corresponding Unicode reference glyph.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} main {{handwritten}} {{forms of the}} Deseret alphabet: a <b>cursive</b> version and a printed version. Over the lifetime of the alphabet, the <b>cursive</b> form fell out of favor among most users of the alphabet and by 1856 no more <b>cursive</b> documents exist. Its impact on the glyphs can however still be plainly seen in the loops of certain characters such as êëÖ, êëÄ and êêº. The earliest surviving versions of the Deseret alphabet, from 1853 (one year before its January 1854 approval), have printed and <b>cursive</b> forms side-by-side, suggesting that a <b>cursive</b> form {{was part of the}} plan from the very beginning.|$|E
5|$|The table below {{shows some}} {{examples}} of how the <b>cursive</b> form is written. Dropped vowels are marked in parenthesis.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cursive</b> {{style has}} many unorthodox {{characteristics}} uncommon to Western writing systems. Vowels can be dropped if {{the writer is}} in a hurry and feels the word is obvious as in an abjad, letters can be written above or below the base line depending on what precedes them, and êêÆ is placed on letters after they are already written as in an abugida. Furthermore, unlike the typeset alphabet, the <b>cursive</b> alphabet has no letter case. These characteristics could have arisen because Watt was a local expert in Pitman shorthand, which is written in a similar way.|$|E
5|$|Hieratic is a simplified, <b>cursive</b> form of Egyptian hieroglyphs. Like hieroglyphs, hieratic {{was used}} in sacred and {{religious}} texts. By the 1st millennium BC, calligraphic hieratic became the script predominantly used in funerary papyri and temple rolls. Whereas the writing of hieroglyphs required the utmost precision and care, <b>cursive</b> hieratic could be written much more quickly and was therefore more practical for scribal record-keeping. Its primary purpose was {{to serve as a}} shorthand script for non-royal, non-monumental, and less formal writings such as private letters, legal documents, poems, tax records, medical texts, mathematical treatises, and instructional guides. Hieratic could be written in two different styles; one was more calligraphic and usually reserved for government records and literary manuscripts, the other was used for informal accounts and letters.|$|E
5|$|Most of Leonardo's {{writings}} are in mirror-image <b>cursive.</b> While secrecy {{is often}} suggested {{as the reason}} for this style of writing, it may have been more of a practical expediency. Since Leonardo wrote with his left hand, it was probably easier for him to write from right to left.|$|E
5|$|Although most printed sources, Harvey (1903), Olszewski (1971), Torres (1984), and the Historic Structure Report (2004), {{refer to}} the {{original}} 1884 inscriptions, the National Geodetic Survey (2015) refers to both the 1884 and 1934 inscriptions. All sources print them {{according to their own}} editorial rules, resulting in excessive capitalization (Harvey, Olszewski, and NGS) and inappropriate line breaks. No printed source uses <b>cursive</b> writing, although pictures of the apex clearly show that it was used for both the 1884 and 1934 inscriptions.|$|E
5|$|More than 99 {{percent of}} the {{population}} speaks Japanese as their first language. Japanese is an agglutinative language distinguished by a system of honorifics reflecting the hierarchical nature of Japanese society, with verb forms and particular vocabulary indicating the relative status of speaker and listener. Japanese writing uses kanji (Chinese characters) and two sets of kana (syllabaries based on <b>cursive</b> script and radical of kanji), as well as the Latin alphabet and Arabic numerals.|$|E
5|$|The text of a New Kingdom Book of the Dead was {{typically}} written in <b>cursive</b> hieroglyphs, most often {{from left to}} right, but also sometimes from right to left. The hieroglyphs were in columns, which were separated by black lines ‚Äì a similar arrangement to that used when hieroglyphs were carved on tomb walls or monuments. Illustrations were put in frames above, below, or between the columns of text. The largest illustrations took up a full page of papyrus.|$|E
5|$|By the Early Dynastic Period in {{the late}} 4th {{millennium}} BC, Egyptian hieroglyphs and their <b>cursive</b> form hieratic were well-established written scripts. Egyptian hieroglyphs are small artistic pictures of natural objects. For example, the hieroglyph for door-bolt, pronounced se, produced the s sound; when this hieroglyph was combined with another or multiple hieroglyphs, it produced a combination of sounds that could represent abstract concepts like sorrow, happiness, beauty, and evil. The Narmer Palette, dated c. 3100 BC during the last phase of Predynastic Egypt, combines the hieroglyphs for catfish and chisel to produce the name of King Narmer.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1st {{millennium}} BC, hieroglyphs and hieratic {{were still}} used for royal, monumental, religious, and funerary writings, while a new, even more <b>cursive</b> script {{was used for}} informal, day-to-day writing: Demotic. The final script adopted by the ancient Egyptians was the Coptic alphabet, a revised version of the Greek alphabet. Coptic became the standard in the 4th century AD when Christianity became the state religion throughout the Roman Empire; hieroglyphs were discarded as idolatrous images of a pagan tradition, unfit for writing the Biblical canon.|$|E
5|$|In Chinese, Japanese, and Korean {{language}} computing (CJK), some of {{the commonly}} used units, prefix‚Äìunit combinations, or unit‚Äìexponent combinations have been allocated predefined single characters taking up a full square. Unicode includes these in its CJK Compatibility and letter-like symbols sub-ranges for back compatibility, without necessarily recommending future usage. These are summarised in Unicode symbols. The <b>cursive</b> ‚Ñì, a letter-like symbol, {{has been used in}} a number of countries in addition to China and Japan as a symbol for the litre, but this is not currently recommended by any standards body.|$|E
5|$|Many modern revival fonts {{based on}} French renaissance {{printing}} {{are influenced by}} the work of Robert Granjon (c. 1513-90), particularly in italic. An engraver with a long and wide-ranging career, Granjon‚Äôs work seems to have ranged much more widely than Garamond‚Äôs focus on roman and Greek type, cutting type in italic, civilit√© (a <b>cursive</b> blackletter), and for the Vatican type in exotic alphabets including Arabic, Armenian and Hebrew. His career also took in stops in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany and finally for the last twelve years of his life Rome, where he ended his career {{in the service of the}} Vatican.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} National Treasures {{writings}} {{that do not}} fit {{in any of the}} above categories, all originating in China. Two are 7th century works: a copy of the Thousand Character Classic by Zhi Yong both in formal and <b>cursive</b> scripts, and a tracing copy of a letter by the famous Chinese calligrapher Wang Xizhi. The former work {{is said to have been}} imported to Japan by the legendary scholar Wani in ancient times. One is a 13th-century set of large-scale letters (2 or 3 each) to be displayed on walls or above doorways.|$|E
5|$|Upon the alphabet's acceptance, {{its first}} user was its {{principal}} architect, George D. Watt, who began writing the meeting {{minutes of the}} early Bishops in a <b>cursive</b> form of it in 1854. Almost immediately after its publication, church members began experimenting with it, and by 1855 travel writers Jules Remy and Julius Brenchley published a chart of the new alphabet which differed heavily from the 1854 version. Some early Mormons, such as Thales Hastings Haskell, began writing their personal journals in the new alphabet. Remy further reported that during his time in Salt Lake City, he saw signs {{on the street and}} above shops using the new alphabet.|$|E
5|$|First {{discovered}} in March 1973, the tablets were initially {{thought to be}} wood shavings until one of the excavators found two stuck together and peeled them apart to discover writing on the inside. They {{were taken to the}} epigraphist Richard Wright, but rapid oxygenation of the wood meant that they were black and unreadable {{by the time he was}} able to view them. They were sent to Alison Rutherford at Newcastle University Medical School for multi-spectrum photography, which led to infra-red photographs showing the scripts for researchers for the first time. The results were initially disappointing as the scripts were undecipherable. However, Alan Bowman at Manchester University and David Thomas at Durham University analysed the previously unknown form of <b>cursive</b> script and were able to produce transcriptions.|$|E
5|$|Hieroglyphic writing {{dates from}} c. 3000BC, and is {{composed}} of hundreds of symbols. A hieroglyph can represent a word, a sound, or a silent determinative; and the same symbol can serve different purposes in different contexts. Hieroglyphs were a formal script, used on stone monuments and in tombs, that could be as detailed as individual works of art. In day-to-day writing, scribes used a <b>cursive</b> form of writing, called hieratic, which was quicker and easier. While formal hieroglyphs may be read in rows or columns in either direction (though typically written from right to left), hieratic was always written from right to left, usually in horizontal rows. A new form of writing, Demotic, became the prevalent writing style, {{and it is this}} form of writing‚Äîalong with formal hieroglyphs‚Äîthat accompany the Greek text on the Rosetta Stone.|$|E
5|$|In {{between these}} works he {{found time to}} write Literarum latinarum, a small {{instruction}} manual on the italic script. The italic script (or chancery <b>cursive)</b> reached the Low Countries from Italy {{at the beginning of}} the sixteenth century and it is recorded as a form of typescript in Leuven in 1522. It was much favoured by humanist scholars who enjoyed its elegance and clarity as well as the rapid fluency that could be attained with practice, but it was not employed for formal purposes such as globes, maps and scientific instruments (which typically used Roman capitals or gothic script). Mercator first applied the italic script to the globe of Gemma Frisius and thereafter to all his works, with ever-increasing elegance. The title page of this work is an illustration of the decorative style he developed.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} family arrive at their new house in Cypress Creek, they meet Homer's new boss, Hank Scorpio, {{who is very}} amiable and seems like the perfect boss. After giving Homer {{a tour of the}} company, Scorpio tells him that his job is to motivate the {{employees}} in the nuclear division. Meanwhile, Bart starts school, but he finds that his new class is far above the standards of Springfield Elementary. When his teacher discovers that Bart cannot read <b>cursive</b> writing, he places him in a remedial class, much to Bart's shock. Lisa goes for a nature walk and discovers that she is allergic to all of the plants around Cypress Creek. Marge tries to go about her daily chores, but the house does everything automatically. This ends up depressing her to the point where Marge starts drinking wine to cope. However, Homer does an excellent job motivating his team in the nuclear division, which makes his family very proud of him.|$|E
5|$|One {{striking}} {{example of}} multilingualism {{as well as}} multiculturalism in the Empire is a 2nd-century epitaph for a woman named Regina, discovered in 1878 near the Roman fort at South Shields, northeast England. The inscription is written in Latin and Palmyrene Aramaic, the language of Regina's husband, Barates, who has been identified with a standardbearer (vexillarius) of that name from Palmyra, Syria. He was most likely in the military stationed along Hadrian's Wall. The Latin, however, is constructed grammatically {{in the manner of}} Greek honorific inscriptions typical of Palmyra, suggesting that Barates was bilingual in Aramaic and Greek, and added Latin as a third language. The Latin portion is larger and longer, and provides most of the information. The Palmyrene is carved in a fluid <b>cursive</b> script, and conveys only the name of Regina and an expression of grief. Since few people in Britain could have read Palmyrene, its use may be Barates' personal statement of his identity and emotions. A fourth linguistic element is the name Regina, which can be either Latin or Celtic. Such names seem often to have been chosen for their deliberate duality. Regina herself is identified as from the British Catuvellauni, a people whose civitas capital was Verulamium, but the Gallo-Brittonic spelling Catuallauna (feminine) is used in the Latin inscription.|$|E
25|$|The {{forms of}} the hiragana {{originate}} from the <b>cursive</b> script style of Chinese calligraphy. The figure below shows the derivation of hiragana from many≈çgana via <b>cursive</b> script. The upper part shows the character in the regular script form, the center character in red shows the <b>cursive</b> script form of the character, and the bottom shows the equivalent hiragana. Note also that the <b>cursive</b> script forms are not strictly confined {{to those in the}} illustration.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, modern <b>cursive</b> script slowly {{emerged from}} the {{clerical}} <b>cursive</b> (zhƒÅngc«éo) script during the Cao Wei to Jin period, {{under the influence of}} both semi-cursive and the newly emerged regular script. <b>Cursive</b> was formalized {{in the hands of a}} few master calligraphers, the most famous and influential of whom was Wang Xizhi.|$|E
25|$|The {{characters}} must be legible. As calligraphy is {{the method}} of writing well, a calligraphic work must be recognizable as script, and furthermore be easily legible to those familiar with the script style, {{although it may be}} illegible to those unfamiliar with the script style. For example, many people cannot read <b>cursive,</b> but a calligraphic work in <b>cursive</b> can still be considered good if those familiar with <b>cursive</b> can read it.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cursive</b> styles such as X√≠ngsh≈´ (semi-cursive {{or running}} script) and C«éosh≈´ (<b>cursive</b> or grass script) show stroke order {{more clearly than}} Regular Script, as each move made by the writing tool is visible.|$|E
25|$|The use of <b>cursive</b> script coexisted with kufic, {{but because}} {{in the early stages}} of their {{development}} they lacked discipline and elegance, <b>cursive</b> were usually used for informal purposes. With the rise of Islam, new script was needed to fit the pace of conversions, and a well defined <b>cursive</b> called naskh first appeared in the 10th century. The script is the most ubiquitous among other styles, used in Qur'ans, official decrees, and private correspondence. It became the basis of modern Arabic print.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time semi-cursive and <b>cursive</b> scripts developed.|$|E
25|$|Practicing {{coordination}} (e.g. {{balance beam}} or <b>cursive</b> writing exercises) is not helpful.|$|E
25|$|The radical Á≥∏ (U+7CF8) {{is used in}} {{characters}} like Á¥Ö/Á∫¢, with two variants, the second form being simply the <b>cursive</b> form. The radical components of Á¥Ö (U+7D05) and Á∫¢ (U+7EA2) are semantically identical and the glyphs differ only in the latter using a <b>cursive</b> version of the Á≥∏ component. However, in mainland China, the standards bodies wanted to standardize the <b>cursive</b> form when used in {{characters like}} Á∫¢. Because this change happened relatively recently, there was a transition period. Both Á¥Ö (U+7D05) and Á∫¢ (U+7EA2) got separate codepoints in the PRC's text encoding standards bodies so Chinese-language documents could use both version. The two variants each received unique codepoints in Unicode as well.|$|E
25|$|The symbol œ∞ ("kappa symbol") is a <b>cursive</b> form of kappa (Œ∫), {{used as a}} {{technical}} symbol.|$|E
25|$|Both {{printed and}} written Arabic are <b>cursive,</b> {{with most of}} the letters within a word {{directly}} connected to the adjacent letters.|$|E
25|$|The {{symbols are}} said to be based on parts of the human anatomy, though many are clearly based on the <b>cursive</b> roman alphabet.|$|E
25|$|Because Great Lakes Aboriginal syllabics is {{not part}} of the Unicode standards, glyphs for this table have been {{approximated}} with <b>cursive</b> Latin script.|$|E
25|$|Japanese {{also has}} its own {{variously}} <b>cursive</b> form of writing kanji characters, the most extremely simplified of which is known as S≈çsho.|$|E
25|$|The symbol œë ("script theta") is a <b>cursive</b> form of theta (Œ∏), {{frequent}} in handwriting, {{and used}} with a specialized meaning as a technical symbol.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cursive</b> styles such as X√≠ngsh≈´ (semi-cursive {{or running}} script) and C«éosh≈´ (<b>cursive</b> or sloppy script) are less {{constrained}} and faster, where more movements {{made by the}} writing implement are visible. These styles' stroke orders vary more, sometimes creating radically different forms. They are descended from Clerical script, {{in the same time}} as Regular script (Han Dynasty), but X√≠ngsh≈´ and C«éosh≈´ were used for personal notes only, and were never used as standard. Caoshu style was highly appreciated during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han (140 BC‚àí87BC).|$|E
25|$|Syriac {{is written}} {{from right to}} left in {{horizontal}} lines. It is a <b>cursive</b> script, but not all letters connect within a word. Spaces separate individual words.|$|E
