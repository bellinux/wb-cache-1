Two widely used 3 D printing filaments are based on polylactic acid (PLA) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) systems. PLA is much more environmentally friendly in comparison to ABS since it is made from renewable resources such as corn, sugarcane, and other starches as precursors. Recently, polylactic acid-based metal powder containing <b>composite</b> <b>filaments</b> have emerged which could be utilized for multifunctional applications.

Carbon nanomaterials show promise as ﬁller materials due to their extremely high conductivity, strength, and surface area. In this work, Graphite, Carbon Nanotubes, and Carbon Black (CB) were mixed with raw Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) pellets.

40|$|The 3 {{dimensional}} printing (3 DP), {{called to}} additive manufacturing (AM) or rapid prototyping (RP), is emerged to revolutionize manufacturing and completely transform how products are designed and fabricated. A {{great deal of}} research activities {{have been carried out}} to apply this new technology to a variety of fields. In spite of many endeavors, much more research is still required to perfect the processes of the 3 D printing techniques especially {{in the area of the}} large-scale additive manufacturing and flexible printed electronics. The principles of various 3 D printing processes are briefly outlined in the Introduction Section. New types of thermoplastic polymer composites aiming to specified functional applications are also introduced in this section. Chapter 2 shows studies about the metal/polymer <b>composite</b> <b>filaments</b> for fused deposition modeling (FDM) process. Various metal particles, copper and iron particles, are added into thermoplastics polymer matrices as the reinforcement filler. The thermo-mechanical properties, such as thermal conductivity, hardness, tensile strength, and fracture mechanism, of composites are tested to figure out the effects of metal fillers on 3 D printed composite structures for the large-scale printing process. In Chapter 3, carbon/polymer <b>composite</b> <b>filaments</b> are developed by a simple mechanical blending process with an aim of fabricating the flexible 3 D printed electronics as a single structure. Various types of carbon particles consisting of multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWCNT), conductive carbon black (CCB), and graphite are used as the conductive fillers to provide the thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) with improved electrical conductivity. The mechanical behavior and conduction mechanisms of the developed composite materials are observed in terms of the loading amount of carbon fillers in this section. Finally, the prototype flexible electronics are modeled and manufactured by the FDM process using Carbon/TPU <b>composite</b> <b>filaments</b> and the FDM printer modified in Chapter 5. The mechanical properties are sensitively affected by the morphology of additive materials such as concentration, size, type, and shape. The printing parameters such as fill density, temperature, nozzle diameter, and layer thickness are also influential factors resulting in changes in final properties of 3 D printed objects. Thus, mechanical properties of the thermoplastic polymers, e. g. acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA), as a function of fill density and printing temperature are studied in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 describes a way to modify the FDM printer for multi-material printing of flexible <b>composite</b> <b>filaments</b> in order to make single-structured 3 D electronics via FDM process. To achieve the goals, the dual-nozzle filament extrusion system is installed to the FDM printer and the part for filament feeding is modified in this chapter. ...|$|R

40|$|Temperature {{dependence}} of the isometric tension was examined in chemically skinned, glycerinated, rabbit Psoas, muscle fibers immersed in relaxing solution (pH approximately 7. 1 at 20 degrees C, pCa approximately 8, ionic strength 200 mM); the average rate of heating/cooling was 0. 5 - 1 degree C/s. The resting tension increased reversibly with temperature (5 - 42 degrees C); the tension increase was slight in warming to approximately 25 degrees C (a linear thermal contraction, -alpha, of approximately 0. 1 %/degree C) but became more pronounced above approximately 30 degrees C (similar behavior was seen in intact rat muscle fibers). The extra tension rise at the high temperatures was depressed in acidic pH and {{in the presence of}} 10 mM inorganic phosphate; it was absent in rigor fibers in which the tension decreased with heating (a linear thermal expansion, alpha, of approximately 4 x 10 (- 5) /degree C). Below approximately 20 degrees C, the tension response after a approximately 1 % length increase (complete < 0. 5 ms) consisted of a fast decay (approximately 150. s- 1 at 20 degrees C) and a slow decay (approximately 10. s- 1) of tension. The rate of fast decay increased with temperature (Q 10 approximately 2. 4); at 35 - 40 degrees C, it was approximately 800. s- 1, and it was followed by a delayed tension rise (stretch-activation) at 30 - 40. s- 1. The linear rise of passive tension in warming to approximately 25 degrees C may be due to increase of thermal stress in titin (connectin) -myosin <b>composite</b> <b>filament,</b> whereas the extra tension above approximately 30 degrees C may arise from cycling cross-bridges; based on previous findings from regulated actomyosin in solution (Fuchs, 1975), it is suggested that heating reversibly inactivates the troponin-tropomyosin control mechanism and leads to Ca-independent thin filament activation at high temperatures. Additionally, we propose that the heating-induced increase of endo-sarcomeric stress within titin-myosin <b>composite</b> <b>filament</b> makes the cross-bridge mechanism stretch-sensitive at high temperatures...|$|E

The porous structure further allowed efficient nucleation, exchange of nutrients, and metabolic waste removal during new tissue formation. Through the incorporation of osteoconductive HA, human fetal osteoblast adhesion and differentiation were greatly enhanced thus setting the tone for further exploration of this novel material for biomedical and tissue regenerative applications...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. To prepare polymer nanocomposites with {{enhanced}} performance, well {{dispersion of}} nanoparticles in matrices is necessary. In this work a new route that combines graft pre-treatment and drawing technique with melt mixing was applied. That is, nano-SiO 2 particles were firstly modified by graft polymerization {{and then the}} grafted nanoparticles were melt-compounded with polypropylene (PP) producing <b>composites</b> <b>filaments</b> via drawing. Finally, the filaments were injection molded into bulk materials. The resultant PP based nanocomposites are much tougher than the unfilled polymer as characterized by either static or dynamic test, besides showing a simultaneous increase in strength and stiffness. Morphology studies indicated that drawing induced extension and separation of the grafted nano-silica agglomerates in PP matrix during making the filaments are frozen {{to a certain extent}} after nanocomposites manufacturing. In this way, the nanoparticles are well distributed in the matrix and correlated with each other throughout the entire composites, which might ensure an overall improvement of mechanical properties. Besides, β-crystal of PP developed in the drawing process can be retained in the nanocomposites, which also contributes to the toughening of PP. In view of these, the proposed drawing aided dispersion of nanoparticles might also be applicable to the preparation of other nanoparticles/polymer composites...|$|R
40|$|The {{adverse effects}} that waste {{plastics}} are having {{on the environment}} is becoming increasingly apparent. However, the plastics recycling industry in New Zealand is entirely market driven, necessitating {{the development of new}} markets to account for increasing quantities of waste. Innovations in additive manufacturing (AM) have presented opportunities to recycle thermoplastics for use as AM feedstock material. Using waste thermoplastic materials to fabricate composites in this way, adds value to the polymer by enhancing mechanical and aesthetic properties. A range of <b>composite</b> <b>filaments</b> with differing fibre and gypsum weight contents were then produced using pre and post-consumer polypropylene (PP). The most successful filaments in terms of tensile properties consisted of 30 wt% harakeke in a post-consumer PP matrix which had a tensile strength and Young’s modulus of 41 MPa and 3. 8 GPa respectively. Comparing these results to those of plain PP filament, showed improvements in tensile strength and Young’s modulus of 77 % and 275 % respectively. Finally, a novel method of measuring shrinkage in 3 d printed components was developed and used to compare relative shrinkage of different composites. The composite that showed the least shrinkage consisted of 30 wt% harakeke with a shrinkage value of 0. 34 % corresponding to a net reduction of 84 % relative to plain PP...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{present the}} mechanical properties, Melt Flow Index (MFI) and Melt Flow Rate (MFR) of an ABS-Copper filament through the Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) machine. The main objectives {{of this study}} are to investigate and analyze the influences of the componding ratio and process parameters of polymer matrix <b>composite</b> (PMC) <b>filament</b> wire material on the mechanical properties, melt flow index (MFI) and melt flow rate (MFR) by FDM machine. In this study, the effect MFR of 10 % - 40 % copper filled in 52 % - 85 % % ABS filament material by volume percentage (vol. %) was investigated experimentally based on the melting temperature and feedrate with the nozzle size 0. 4 mm and 0. 6 mm in diameter through the FDM heated liquefied head. The mechanical properties of ABS-Copper filament through the injection molding machine and Melt Flow Rate by the FDM liquefied head was investigated in experimental for the mechanical properties and MFR. Based on the result obtained, it was found that, increment of 30 %(vol. %) copper filled in ABS filament material increase the mechanical properties and MFR (velocity and length) of PMC filament material through the FDM machine. It can be concluded that, highest temperature and feed rate are needed to extrude polymer matrix <b>composite</b> (PMC) <b>filament</b> compared to ABS filament material in FDM machine...|$|R
