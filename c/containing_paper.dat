6000|$|Moreover, {{the first}} sweep of royal fury being past, his Majesty's stern {{regulations}} at Custrin began to relax in fulfilment; to be obeyed only by those immediately responsible, and in letter {{rather than in}} spirit even by those. President von Munchow who {{is head of the}} Domain-Kammer, chief representative of Government at Custrin, and resides in the Fortress there, ventures after a little, the Prince's doors being closed as we saw, to have an orifice bored through the floor above, and thereby to communicate with the Prince, and sympathetically ask, What he can do for him? Many things, books among others, are, under cunning contrivance, smuggled in by the judicious Munchow, willing to risk himself in such a service. For example, Munchow has a son, a clever boy of seven years old; who, to the wonder of neighbors, goes into child's-petticoats again; and testifies the liveliest desire to be admitted to the Prince, and bear him company a little! Surely the law of No-company does not extend to that of an innocent child? The innocent child has a row of pockets all round the inside of his long gown; and goes laden, miscellaneously, like a ship of the desert, or cockboat not forbidden to cross the line. Then there are stools, one stool at least indispensable to human nature; and the inside of this, once you open it, is a chest-of-drawers, <b>containing</b> <b>paper,</b> ink, new literature and much else.

5000|$|In 1967, S. B. Carter {{reported}} {{the use of}} shadow-evaporated palladium islands for cell attachment. After this first bio-MEMS study, subsequent development in the field was slow for around 20 years. In 1985, Unipath Inc. commercialized ClearBlue, a pregnancy test still used today that can be considered the first microfluidic device <b>containing</b> <b>paper</b> and the first microfluidic product to market. In 1990, Andreas Manz and H. Michael Widmer from Ciba-Geigy (now Novartis), Switzerland first coined the term micro total analysis system (μTAS) in their seminal paper proposing the use of miniaturized total chemical analysis systems for chemical sensing. There have been three major motivating factors behind the concept of μTAS. Firstly, drug discovery in the last decades {{leading up to the}} 1990s had been limited due to the time and cost of running many chromatographic analyses in parallel on macroscopic equipment. Secondly, the Human Genome Project (HGP), which started in October 1990, created demand for improvements in DNA sequencing capacity. Capillary electrophoresis thus became a focus for chemical and DNA separation. Thirdly, DARPA of the US Department of Defense supported a series of microfluidic research programs in the 1990s after realizing there was a need to develop field-deployable microsystems for the detection of chemical and biological agents that were potential military and terrorist threats. Researchers started to use photolithography equipment for microfabrication of microeletromechanical systems (MEMS) as inherited from the microelectronics industry. At the time, the application of MEMS to biology was limited because this technology was optimized for silicon or glass wafers and used solvent-based photoresists that were not compatible with biological material. In 1993, George M. Whitesides, a Harvard chemist, introduced inexpensive PDMS-based microfabrication and this revolutionized the bio-MEMS field. Since then, the field of bio-MEMS has exploded. Selected major technical achievements during bio-MEMS development of the 1990s include: ...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed to {{understand}} the properties of concrete panel <b>containing</b> <b>paper</b> sludge as sand replacement. The control mixture is composed without paper sludge. The other mixtures were produced by replacing the coefficient of sand content, gradually by 0. 25, so that the total are 12 mixtures. All the sand for the final mixture was replaced by paper sludge. The mixtures were produced using mechanic mixes to achieve homogenous mixtures before cast in 200 mm x 100 mm x 50 mm steel frame. After 21 hours keep in the steel frame, the samples were then cured in water for 3 days, followed by water sprayed twice a day, for 24 days. The results of the test indicated that the concrete panel <b>containing</b> <b>paper</b> sludge is lighter then the control mixture, higher water absorbtion and higher thermal coefficient.

40|$|A {{major problem}} {{arising from the}} {{widespread}} use of forestry biomass and processed timber waste as fuel is related to the production of significant quantities of ash as a by-product from the incineration of such biomasses. A major portion (approximately 70 %) of the wood waste ash produced is land-filled as a common method of disposal. If the current trend continues with waste products, such as paper mill sludge landfills, a large amount of space would be required by 2020. A revenue study was conducted as a result of investigations into the use of paper mill sludge as recycled materials and additives in concrete mixes for use in construction projects. The study had to provide the assurance that the concrete produced had the correct mechanical strength. Concrete mixes <b>containing</b> <b>paper</b> mill sludge were prepared, and their basic strength characteristics such as the compressive strength, flexural strength, ultra pulse velocity and dynamic modulus elasticity were tested. Four concrete mixes, i. e. a control mix, and a 10 %, 20 %, and 30 % mix of paper mill sludge as cement replacement for concrete were prepared with a DoE mix design by calculating the weight of cement, sand and aggregate. The performance of each concrete specimen was compared with the strength of the control mix. As a result, when the percentage of paper mill sludge in the concrete increased, the strength decreased. Overall, a high correlation was observed between density and strength of the concrete <b>containing</b> <b>paper</b> mill sludge...|$|E

40|$|A {{certificate}} of authenticity (COA) is an inexpensive physical object that has a random unique structure with high cost of near-exact reproduction. An additional requirement is that the uniqueness of COA’s random structure can be verified using an inexpensive device. Bauder {{was the first to}} propose COAs created as a randomized augmentation of a set of fibers into a transparent gluing material that randomly fixes once for all the position of the fibers within. In this paper, we propose a novel system for automated verification of fiber-based COAs and outline the key challenges in enabling high cost-efficiency of such a system. The key features of the new COA scanner are simplicity, reliability, lack of any moving components, and the ability to accurately identify exact positions of individual fibers infused in COA’s <b>containing</b> <b>paper.</b> The latter feature significantly increases the forging cost compared to trivial implementations of a COA scanner...|$|E

Given such an ansatz we make no further approximations in the evaluation of the correlators. Our calculations for the vector, axial vector and scalar channels show qualitative agreement with the phenomenological predictions, whereas the pseudoscalar channel does not. However, the pseudoscalar correlator, when approximated by saturating with intermediate one pion states agrees with results obtained from spectral density functions parameterised by pion decay constant and $ $ value obtained from chiral perturbation theory. We discuss this departure in the pseudoscalar channel, in context of the quark propagation in the vacuum.

30|$|The {{protocol}} for GCF collections involved gentle removal of visible plaque at both sites followed by washing and drying the premolar regions using air syringe to avoid contaminating the paper strip (Periopaper, Harco, Tustin, CA, USA) by the plaque. Then, paper strips were inserted for 1  mm into the gingival crevice and left there for 30  seconds. Periotron 8000 (Periotron 8000, Oraflow Inc., New York, USA) {{was used to}} measure the volume of GCF in each paper strip.
