5|$|Final Fantasy IX {{takes place}} {{primarily}} on the four continents of a world named Gaia. Most of Gaia's population reside on the Mist <b>Continent,</b> named so because the entire <b>continent</b> is blanketed in thick Mist. Lands outside the Mist Continent—the Outer, Lost and Forgotten continents—are uncharted territories not explored until midway through the game. Several locations in the parallel world of Terra and the dream land of Memoria round out the game's areas. The Mist <b>Continent</b> features four nations: Alexandria, Lindblum, Burmecia, and Cleyra. Alexandria is a kingdom to the northeast of the Mist <b>Continent</b> ruled by a monarchy located in Alexandria Castle. The technologically advanced Lindblum, governed by a regent, is nestled on a plateau to the southwest where airships regularly fly by. The Kingdom of Burmecia, whose capital is showered by eternal rain is to the northwest and nearby to the isolated Cleyran civilization, which is nestled in a giant tree in the desert, protected by a powerful sandstorm. Treno, a large, perpetually dark city, heavily populated by both aristocrats and paupers, {{is located in the}} southeast part of the <b>continent.</b> The Mist <b>Continent</b> is extremely mountainous resulting in a natural barrier between many of the ruling nations.|$|E

5|$|Final Fantasy VI {{takes place}} on a large, unnamed world. During {{the course of the}} game, its {{geography}} and landscape change due to various developments in the game's plot. During {{the first half of the}} game, the world is divided into three major continents and referred to as the World of Balance. The northern <b>continent</b> is punctuated by a series of mountain ranges and contains many of the locations accessible to the player. Most of the southern <b>continent</b> has been taken over by the Empire, while the eastern <b>continent</b> is home to a large patch of land called the Veldt where monsters from all over the world can be found. Halfway through the game, the world's geographical layout is altered, resulting in its three large continents splitting into several islands of various size situated around a larger <b>continent</b> at their center. This altered layout of the game's locations is referred to as the World of Ruin.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Continents,</b> in {{particular}} large or supercontinents, {{will affect the}} climate of the planet drastically. In general the interaction of supercontinents and climate {{is similar to the}} interaction between present-day <b>continents</b> and climate, just on a different scale. Supercontinents have a larger effect on climate than do <b>continents.</b> The configuration and placement of the <b>continents</b> has a larger influence on climate. <b>Continents</b> modify global wind patterns, control ocean current paths and have a higher albedo than the oceans. Because <b>continents</b> are higher in the elevation, the temperature decreases with altitude. The wind is redirected by mountains. The albedo difference causes a shift in climate by onshore winds. [...] "Continentality" [...] occurs because the center of large <b>continents</b> are generally higher in elevations and are therefore cooler and drier. This is seen today with Eurasia, and evidence is present in the rock record that this is true for the middle of Pangaea.|$|R

5|$|Did Siletzia pivot {{about its}} {{northern}} end or southern end? This question has attracted considerable attention, {{with the evidence}} now favoring a northern pivot.

5|$|Early {{development}} of the women's game at the time colonial powers brought football to Sierra Leone and the <b>continent</b> was limited, as colonial powers in the region tended to take concepts of patriarchy and women's participation in sport with them to local cultures that already had similar concepts already embedded in them. Other factors on the <b>continent</b> impact the {{development of}} the game, including limited access to education, poverty among women in the wider society, and fundamental inequality present in the society that occasionally allows for female specific human rights abuses. When quality players are developed in Africa, they often leave for greater opportunities elsewhere <b>Continent</b> wide; most of the funding for women's football in a country and for the women's national team comes from FIFA, not the national football association. Future success for women's football in Africa is dependent on improved facilities and access by women to these facilities. Attempting to commercialise the game is not the solution, as demonstrated by the existence of many youth and women's football camps held on the <b>continent</b> that have resulted in improved national team performance as players progressed through the system.|$|E

5|$|His {{fleet of}} 13 ships sailed {{far into the}} western Atlantic Ocean, perhaps intentionally, where he made {{landfall}} on what he initially {{assumed to be a}} large island.
