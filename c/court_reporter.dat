5|$|Bottomley {{spent five}} years in an orphanage before {{beginning}} his career, aged 14, as an errand boy. Subsequent experience as a solicitor's clerk gave him a useful knowledge of English law, which he later put to effective use in his court appearances. After working as a shorthand writer and <b>court</b> <b>reporter,</b> at 24 he founded his own publishing company which launched numerous magazines and papers, including, in 1888, the Financial Times. He over-reached himself with an ambitious public flotation of his company, which led to his first arraignment on fraud charges in 1893. Despite evidence of malpractice, Bottomley, who defended himself, was acquitted. He subsequently amassed a fortune as a promoter of shares in gold-mining companies.|$|E
5|$|The Diary of a Nobody was {{the work}} of George Grossmith and his brother Weedon Grossmith, the sons of a <b>court</b> <b>reporter</b> and {{part-time}} stage entertainer, also named George. The younger George followed his father, first as a reporter and later on the stage; the 7-years-younger Weedon studied at the West London School of Art and had some success as a portrait painter before becoming a comic actor. The brothers were fascinated with the stage at an early age. In 1864, at 17 and 10, they hosted a complex programme of musical and dramatic entertainment in their parents' garden at Haverstock Hill. This included a 20-minute burlesque version of Hamlet, in which George played the title role; Weedon was Ophelia.|$|E

50|$|Many <b>court</b> <b>reporters</b> work as {{freelance}} reporters {{or independent}} contractors {{outside the courtroom}} in depositions and other situations that require an official legal transcript, such as arbitration hearings or other formal proceedings. <b>Court</b> <b>reporters</b> also often provide real-time transcription for public events, religious services, webcasts, and educational services.

50|$|Salaries {{and demand}} vary in the United States, with California {{employing}} more <b>court</b> <b>reporters</b> {{than any other}} state with the exception of New York, with an average yearly salary of over $76,000.However, state budget cuts beginning in early 2013 have forced many superior courts in California to lay off the <b>court</b> <b>reporters</b> as well as close courtrooms or shorten hours. As a result, law firms turn to court reporting companies to hire <b>court</b> <b>reporters</b> at their own expense {{in order to have a}} motion or trial in court recorded in stenotypy. The fees associated with this work and the issue of whether reporters can charge their own rates or whether they are set by statute have been in dispute and become the subject of a legal battle.|$|R

He attended trade school to become a <b>court</b> <b>reporter</b> and subsequently joined the army.

Tainter resided there for several months to supervise manufacturing before becoming seriously ill, but later went on to continue his inventive work for many years, as health permitted. The small Bridgeport plant which in its early times was able to produce three or four machines daily later became, as a successor firm, the Dictaphone Corporation.|$|E

He ordered the <b>court</b> <b>reporter</b> to halt transcription of the proceedings and C-SPAN to shut off its cameras. Sensenbrenner defended his actions by stating that the Democrats and witnesses had violated House rules in discussing issues unrelated to the subject of the meeting. Democrats have claimed that his walkout was contrary to House parliamentary procedure, which is to adjourn either on motion or without objection.|$|E

In 1953, he returned to Japan, where he met with Nakagawa Soen, a protégé of Nyogen Senzaki. At Nakagawa's recommendation, he began to study with Harada and later with Yasutani. In 1965, he published a book, The Three Pillars of Zen, which recorded a set of talks by Yasutani outlining his approach to practice, along with transcripts of dokusan interviews and some additional texts.|$|E

No deadline was given by the War Department in Washington, DC, though the academy was expected to get it done as soon as possible. Major Worth was president of the inquiry, with Lieutenant Henry H. Gird acting as secretary (<b>court</b> <b>reporter),</b> and two other faculty and staff to be selected by Thayer for court duties. If the inquiry determined that further disciplinary action was necessary, Thayer was empowered to court-martial any cadet or other military personnel. Worth elected Hitchcock and Lieutenant William Bryant to the court, despite Hitchcock's involvement in controlling the riots in North Barracks.|$|E

25|$|Blackford {{published}} {{the first of}} his eight volumes of Blackford’s Reports in 1830. It was immediately in demand among the state’s judicial establishment as there was at that time no other readily available source for Supreme Court decisions. The Indiana General Assembly later approved and funded the publishing of the two volume Indiana Reports, which was authored by the <b>court</b> <b>reporter</b> and reported the entirety of the decisions of the Supreme Court. Blackford’s Reports still remained more popular because of their superior style and quality. His reports were noted by readers for their concision, accuracy, and diction. They soon became popular in other US states where common law was used. Within a decade his reports had spread to Europe. As Great Britain used common law, his reports were also published in Britain and Canada where they were used as a legal resource.|$|E
25|$|Blackford still {{desired to}} be {{associated}} with the court so he could write the court reports. He was successfully nominated to run for the position of <b>court</b> <b>reporter</b> on the Whig ticket in 1853, but was defeated in the election by future Vice President of the United States Thomas Hendricks. After being defeated in his second election attempt after leaving the court, he briefly returned to private life. He opened a law office and took on one case which he argued before Judge David Wallace. He stumbled in making his arguments as he was unaccustomed to speaking publicly and he lost the case. He found the change of position embarrassing and was occasionally offended by the public and the court system for not showing him what he considered due respect. After the loss of his case he closed his law office.|$|E
25|$|He was reappointed to {{his seat}} on the Supreme Court four times, serving until the {{adoption}} of the 1851 Constitution of Indiana, which made his position subject to election rather than appointment. Defeated for the Whig party nomination to run for his office, he left the court in 1852. He was defeated again in the 1853 election to become Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>Reporter,</b> which led him to seek a position on the federal courts after briefly attempting to practice law. Appointed by President Franklin Pierce, he served as a federal court judge of the newly created United States Court of Claims dealing with financial claims against the federal government from 1855 until his death. During his lifetime Blackford accumulated a small fortune through the sale of his reports which was left to his only living relative, his half-sister Charolotte Teresa Coons.|$|E
