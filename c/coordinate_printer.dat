40|$|Many 3 D {{printers}} utilize a Cartesian (XYZ) printing process. Implementing a polar <b>coordinate</b> <b>printer</b> {{providing a}} faster printing method and introduces new printing algorithms, increasing printing efficiency. This cylindrical 3 D printer applies a circular-moving baseplate and a heating printer head (extruder) moving radially and vertically. A processor accepts pre-processed polar data points and transpose the appropriate programmed printing commands to the motors units. The extruder {{also has a}} control loop, keeping the temperature inside the desired range. This prototype prints using polylactic acid (PLA) filament. Additionally, a display screen updates every second the: printing time, extruder temperature, and status notifications...|$|E
