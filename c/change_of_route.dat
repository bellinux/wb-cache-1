5|$|The next {{plan for}} the Channel Tunnel Rail Link {{involved}} a tunnel reaching London from the south-east, and an underground terminus {{in the vicinity of}} King's Cross station. A late change in the plans, principally driven by the then Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine's desire for urban regeneration in east London, led to a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>route,</b> with the new line approaching London from the east. This opened the possibility of reusing the underused St Pancras station as the terminus, with access via the North London Line that crosses the throat of the station.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the canal}} began in 1822, with James Hollinsworth as the {{engineer}} and John Easton as the senior surveyor. The Bristol and Taunton scheme had incorporated a high-level crossing of the River Parrett, but the shortened canal would now join the Parrett at Huntworth, where a basin was to be constructed. This <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>route</b> resulted in the Reverend Robert Gray obtaining an injunction, {{and work on the}} lower half {{of the canal}} stopped until the new route could be properly authorised by the 1824 Act. By this time, the estimated cost had risen to £60,000. Below Durston, the canal was cut into the clay subsoil, the clay forming a naturally waterproof channel; but from Durston to Taunton the canal bed had to be puddled with clay to make it watertight, as the underlying ground was shale.|$|E
5|$|Near its mouth, the River Rother {{no longer}} follows its ancient course, {{as it once}} flowed across Romney Marsh and joined the sea at Dungeness. It is widely {{asserted}} that in 1287 a hurricane, known as the Great Storm, caused large quantities of shingle and mud to be deposited on the port of Romney and {{the mouth of the}} river. The water from the river created a new channel, joining the River Brede and the River Tillingham near Rye, where the combined rivers flow into the sea. However, Tatton-Brown has argued that patterns of occupation on Romney Marsh suggest that the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>route</b> took place at least a century before that date. Rye became part of the Cinque Ports in the thirteenth century, and although it is situated some distance from the sea, its harbour is still visited by commercial shipping and has a fleet of fishing boats.|$|E

A panel of one colour on a different colour of background therefore indicates a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>route</b> status. A smaller area of colour, called a patch, surrounds a bracketed route number (but not its associated destination) to indicate a higher status route that is joined some distance away. A patch may only be coloured blue or green.|$|E
25|$|In 1983 the D {{elected to}} join Amtrak, citing {{increasing}} losses in passenger operations. Amtrak re-routed the San Francisco Zephyr over the D's Moffat Subdivision between Denver and Salt Lake City, its original preference from 1971. The change {{was scheduled for}} April 25, but a mudslide at Thistle, Utah closed the line and delayed the change until July 16. With the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>route,</b> Amtrak renamed the train as the California Zephyr. The modern California Zephyr uses mostly the same route as the original east of Salt Lake City. While the train departs Salt Lake City to the west on former Western Pacific tracks (now part of the Central Corridor), the train switches to the Overland Route {{by the time it}} reaches Winnemucca. As the Union Pacific Railroad uses directional running across central Nevada, the spot the train switches lines depends on the direction of travel. The route west of Elko, Nevada is essentially the route of the former City of San Francisco.|$|E

25|$|Clarence T. Barrett, Henry P. Judah, and Theodore C. Vermilyen were {{appointed}} as commissioners to appraise {{the value of}} the land required by the Staten Island Rapid Transit Railroad Company to extend the Staten Island Railroad from Vanderbilt's Landing to Tompkinsville. Work on the line was not set to begin until the commissioners made their report. The SIRT filed a map of the proposed route {{in the office of the}} clerk of Richmond County, with the line passing through the lawn of Ms. Post on the North Shore of the island. On February 26, 1883, Mr. Franklin Bartlett and Mr. Clifford Bartlett, on behalf of Ms. Post, notified the court that a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>route</b> would be demanded. The new line, after leaving Vanderbilt's Landing, crossed the property formerly occupied by the Seaman's Retreat, but since acquired by the state by the Marine Society, then through the property of the New York Coast Wrecking Company, the lumber yards of C. C. Eddy & Sons, the carriage factory of J. Scott, the Schaeffer grounds, property represented by Coudert brothers, the grounds of George Bechtel, Rubsnin & Horrman, the brewers; S. L. Mulford & Co.'s coal and wood yard, and lands of Samuel Barton and W. Butler Duncan. The only other building upon the line besides Scott's carriage factory is a small barn on the Schaeffer grounds. The cost of the extension was estimated to be $150,000.|$|E
25|$|British {{forces were}} not well handled during Diadem. Oliver Leese, the {{commander}} of Eighth Army, made an enormous mistake by sending the heavily mechanised XIII Corps up the Liri Valley towards Rome. An enormous traffic jam developed. There was also controversy over the handling of American forces. VI Corps had originally been supposed to interpose itself on the route to Rome and cut off the German forces retreating from the Winter Line. However, Clark decided instead to advance on Rome, and ordered only a comparatively token force into a blocking position and ordered {{the rest of the}} Corps to head for Rome. The Germans brushed aside the blocking force and thus a major part of their formations escaped encirclement. A total of 25 divisions (roughly a tenth of the Wehrmacht) escaped, and this led to the war in Italy dragging on until 1945. Speculation surrounds this whole episode and many in the Allied command felt that Mark Clark had disobeyed direct orders for his own glory and contributed to the war's extension. If he had cut off those forces as had been planned and ordered, they could have been destroyed {{in the same way as}} was achieved in France, and the German resistance in Italy would have collapsed. The Allies could have advanced up the spine of Italy and invaded Austria and southern Germany. This was the plan of the British, one not supported by the Americans, and as such Mark Clark's actions may have been politically motivated, or driven by Washington. It is true that Mark Clark was not punished for his <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>route,</b> even though other commanders were for less.|$|E
500|$|In 1980 the Oslo Tunnel was opened, {{allowing}} trains {{along the}} Drammen Line {{to go to}} the new Oslo Central Station, an upgrade of the former Oslo Ø. As a consequence of this, passenger trains were since the late 1980s rerouted via Drammen instead of via Roa, following the Drammen Line and the Randsfjord Line to Hønefoss. This allows the trains to pass through more densely populated areas and on trackage with more capacity.

Emboldened by the success of the small Minamata cooperative, the Kumamoto Prefectural Alliance of Fishing Cooperatives also decided to seek compensation from Chisso. On 17 October, 1,500 fishermen from the alliance descended on the factory to demand negotiations. When this produced no results, the alliance members took their campaign to Tokyo, securing an official visit to Minamata by members of the Japanese Diet. During the visit on 2 November, alliance members forced their way into the factory and rioted, causing many injuries and ¥10 million ($91,738) worth of damage.

Our {{interests}} are not on the same scale as theirs, perhaps, but much more complex. The movement of a foreign power--an alien sleigh on this Pontic shore--must be explained and accounted for, or this public's heart will burst with unsatisfied curiosity. If it be Buck Davis, with the white mare that he traded his colt for, and the practically new sleigh-robe that he bought at the Sewell auction, why does Buck Davis, who lives on the river flats, cross our hills, unless Murder Hollow be blockaded with snow, or unless he has turkeys for sale? But Buck Davis with turkeys would surely have stopped here, unless he were selling a large stock in town. A wail from the sacking at the back of the sleigh tells the tale. It is a winter calf, and Buck Davis is going to sell it for one dollar to the Boston Market where it will be turned into potted chicken. This leaves the mystery of his <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>route</b> unexplained. After two days' sitting on tenter-hooks it is discovered, obliquely, that Buck went to pay a door-yard call on Orson Butler, who lives on the saeter where the wind and the bald granite scaurs fight it out together. Kirk Demming had brought Orson news of a fox at the back of Black Mountain, and Orson's eldest son, going to Murder Hollow with wood for the new barn floor that the widow Amidon is laying down, told Buck that he might as well come round to talk to his father about the pig. But old man Butler meant fox-hunting from the first, and what he wanted to do was to borrow Buck's dog, who had been duly brought over with the calf, and left on the mountain. No old man Butler did not go hunting alone, but waited till Buck came back from town. Buck sold the calf for a dollar and a quarter and not for seventy-five cents as was falsely asserted by interested parties. Then the two went after the fox together. This much learned, everybody breathes freely, if life has not been complicated in the meantime by more strange counter-marchings.|$|E

30|$|In this article, we {{proposed}} a beacon cluster based routing algorithm for the convergence of WSN and cellular network service applications.

Accordingly, the performance of the whole network is optimized via optimal division during the routing procedure. More than 50 % of the energy consumption can be saved comparing with conventional network. Furthermore, it is possible to reduce the re-clustering communication overhead since the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>routes</b> between the sensor nodes is minimized. Sensor network topology can adapt to the data collection pattern of real-time quantity and position of mobile gateways flexibly. Meanwhile the re-routing expenditure has been transformed to lower the distributed calculation consumption in the sensor network.|$|R
