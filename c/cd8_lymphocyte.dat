Correlation of <b>CD8</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> {{activation}} with cellular viremia and plasma HIV RNA {{levels in}} asymptomatic patients infected by {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1. AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses, 1996; 12:17-24.|$|E
50|$|Evidence also {{suggests}} that <b>CD8</b> T <b>lymphocyte</b> cells mediate protection against Yersinia by production of cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF-alpha and gamma interferon IFN) and by killing bacteria-associated host cells to promote internalization by neighbouring phagocytes.|$|R
5|$|HIV infects vital {{cells in}} the human immune system such as helper T cells (specifically CD4+ T cells), macrophages, and {{dendritic}} cells. HIV infection leads to low levels of CD4+ T cells {{through a number of}} mechanisms, including pyroptosis of abortively infected T cells, apoptosis of uninfected bystander cells, direct viral killing of infected cells, and killing of infected CD4+ T cells by <b>CD8</b> cytotoxic <b>lymphocytes</b> that recognize infected cells. When CD4+ T cell numbers decline below a critical level, cell-mediated immunity is lost, and the body becomes progressively more susceptible to opportunistic infections.|$|R
50|$|HIV {{infection}} {{leads to}} {{low levels of}} CD4+ T cells (lowering the CD4+/CD8+ ratio) {{through a number of}} mechanisms, including pyroptosis of abortively infected T cells, apoptosis of uninfected bystander cells, direct viral killing of infected cells, and killing of infected CD4+ T cells by <b>CD8</b> cytotoxic <b>lymphocytes</b> that recognize infected cells. When CD4+ T cell numbers decline below a critical level, cell-mediated immunity is lost, and the body becomes progressively more susceptible to opportunistic infections. Assessing the levels of viable CD4+/CD8+ T cells in HIV-infected human lymphoid tissues using flow cytometry is shown here (Figure S5).|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of known causes of myopathy, and it is only once these have been ruled out that a {{clinician}} will assign an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) syndrome to a case. The usual criteria for a diagnosis of PM are weakness in muscles of the head, neck, trunk, upper arms or upper legs; raised blood serum concentrations of some muscle enzymes such as creatine kinase; unhealthy muscle changes on electromyography; and biopsy findings of (i) muscle cell degeneration and regeneration and (ii) chronic inflammatory infiltrates in muscle cells. If heliotrope (purple) rash or Gottron's papules are also present, then the diagnosis is DM. In DM, myositis may not be clinically apparent but detectable via biopsy or MRI. If the criteria for PM are met but muscle weakness also affects the hands and feet or is not accompanied by pain IBM should be suspected, and confirmed when muscle cell biopsy reveals (i) cytoplasmic vacuoles fringed by basophilic granules and (ii) inflammatory infiltrate comprising mostly <b>CD8</b> T <b>lymphocytes</b> and macrophages; and electron microscopy reveals filamentous inclusions in both cytoplasm and nucleus.|$|R
50|$|An {{experiment}} that used monoclonal antibodies that were specific for chick Ia (a chicken class II {{major histocompatibility complex}} antigen), and T and B-lymphocytes were observed to determine its effects on cellular infiltrates during the development of reovirus arthritis. Within the synovium collected, plasma cells and T-lymphocytes were the primary inflammatory cells present. During the acute-phase, CD8 cells were present in low numbers. The most activity was observed during the subacute phase {{with an increase in}} <b>CD8</b> and CD4 <b>lymphocytes.</b> At this phase, clusters of IgM-positive, B-cells, T-cells, and plasma cells were also observed. During the chronic phase, a high amount of CD4 T- cells and a few IgM-positive B-cells were observed.|$|R
50|$|IFNγ, or type II interferon, is a {{cytokine}} that {{is critical}} for innate and adaptive immunity against viral, some bacterial and protozoal infections. IFNγ is an important activator of macrophages and inducer of Class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule expression. Aberrant IFNγ expression {{is associated with a}} number of autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The importance of IFNγ in the immune system stems in part from its ability to inhibit viral replication directly, and most importantly from its immunostimulatory and immunomodulatory effects. IFNγ is produced predominantly by natural killer (NK) and natural killer T (NKT) cells as part of the innate immune response, and by CD4 Th1 and <b>CD8</b> cytotoxic T <b>lymphocyte</b> (CTL) effector T cells once antigen-specific immunity develops. IFNγ is also produced by non-cytotoxic innate lymphoid cells (ILC), a family of immune cells first discovered in the early 2010's.|$|R
