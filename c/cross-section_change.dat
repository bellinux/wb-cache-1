Additionally, the cooling curves at the <b>cross-section</b> <b>change</b> region also showed that the distribution of temperature was different on the two side of the platform.

40|$|Abstract 10. 1002 /hyp. 7587. abs In {{order to}} {{quantify}} total error affecting hydrological models and predictions, we must explicitly recognize errors in input data, model structure, model parameters and validation data. This paper tackles {{the last of}} these: errors in discharge measurements used to calibrate a rainfall-runoff model, caused by stage–discharge rating-curve uncertainty. This uncertainty {{may be due to}} several combined sources, including errors in stage and velocity measurements during individual gaugings, assumptions regarding a particular form of stage–discharge relationship, extrapolation of the stage–discharge relationship beyond the maximum gauging, and <b>cross-section</b> <b>change</b> due to vegetation growth and/or bed movement. A methodology is presented to systematically assess and quantify the uncertainty in discharge measurements due to all of these sources. For a given stage measurement, a complete PDF of true discharge is estimated. Consequently, new model calibration techniques can be introduced to explicitly account for the discharge error distribution. The method is demonstrated for a gravel-bed river in New Zealand, where all the above uncertainty sources can be identified, including significant uncertainty in cross-section form due to scour and re-deposition of sediment. Results show that rigorous consideration of uncertainty in flow data results in significant improvement of the model's ability to predict the observed flow.

Using about 50 -year-long hydrological, sedimentary and cross-sectional data, temporal response processes of Toudaoguai cross-section located in the upper Yellow River to the operation of reservoirs built upstream are analyzed. The results show that the Toudaoguai <b>cross-section</b> <b>change</b> was influenced strongly by upstream reservoir operation and downstream channel bed armoring thereafter occurred gradually and extended to the reach below Sanhuhekou gauging station. Besides, median diameter of suspended sediment load experienced a three-stage change that is characterized by an increase at first, then a decrease and an increase again finally, which reflects the process of channel bed armoring that began at Qingtongxia reservoir and then gradually developed downstream to the reach below Sanhuhekou cross-section. Since the joint operation strategy of Longyangxia, Liujiaxia and Qingtongxia reservoirs was introduced in 1986, the three-stage change trend has become less evident than that in the time period between 1969 and 1986 when only Qingtongxia and Liupaxia reservoirs were put into operation alone. In addition, since 1987, the extent of lateral migration and thalweg elevation change at Toudaoguai cross-section has reduced dramatically, cross-sectional profile and location tended to be stable, which is beneficial to the normal living for local people...|$|E

40|$|A {{scheme to}} {{generate}} one-group problem-dependent cross-section libraries for point-depletion calculations with the ORIGEN-S code was developed {{as an alternative}} to the SAS 2 H sequence of the SCALE code system. The methodology, named Automatic Rapid Processing (ARP), generates libraries by interpolating in SAS 2 H precomputed cross section libraries. The method has been used to generate ORIGEN-S cross section libraries on a personal computer resulting in a great reduction of computer time without a sacrifice of accuracy over that required by corresponding SAS 2 H calculations. The ARP scheme generates ORIGEN-S libraries by interpolating in burnup and enrichment for PWR assemblies. The intent of this work is to describe a procedure which extends the application of the ARP methodology to BWR assemblies by including the axial water-density effects in the generation of the ORIGEN-S cross-section libraries. The axial liquid- to-steam change of state in BWR systems leads to a variation in the water density and significant cross-section changes as a function of the water density. To account for the axial water-density changes in a SAS 2 H calculation, the water density is entered explicitly in the generation of the one-group ORIGEN-S cross-section libraries generated from the SCALE 27 -group library. In its original version, ARP does not account for the effects of water-density variation in ORIGEN-S cross-section library generation, and, therefore, its application is restricted to systems for which the impact of this parameter is negligible.

At {{least some of the}} rovings are laid down as {{individual}} sections (4) cut from a continuous roving length and are tension-free. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - All yarns or fiber rovings (2) of the preform (1) are formed as sections (4) cut from a semi-continuous yarn or fiber roving. Each layer (6 a, 6 b) comprises rows (5 a, 5 b) of individual roving sections adjacent to each other with same orientation, the sections being either parallel to or at a slight angle to each other. The rows are formed across the entire breadth of each layer. Adjacent roving rows may overlap each other. Individual roving sections are laid down at an angle to the longitudinal direction (L) of the roving preform (1). Roving sections of one or more rows of rovings may be placed simultaneously. During placement rovings are converted from a round cross-section to a flat rectangular cross-section (7). The <b>cross-section</b> <b>change</b> may be produced either before, during or after cutting of roving sections or after placing the latter. Following placement the roving sections of a layer are temporarily held in position by pairs of rolls. Roving sections may be sewn, woven or bonded together. Roving sections are laid down on a base material (9) or previous roving layer which is moved in the longitudinal direction of the preform. Roving sections in the uppermost and lowest layers are attached to carrier layers forming either a base material and/or a cover material.

The length to the circular cross-section also depended on the orifice area, a larger area gave a longer distance than a smaller area.

In vitro images of human vessels (n = 75) demonstrated that lesion thickness determined echographically closely related with histological samples (r = 0. 83). Morphologically, muscular and elastic arteries could be distinguished echographically based on the echogenicity of the arterial media. Close relation was also found in the morphological subtypes of atherosclerosis. Subsequently, intravascular ultrasound was used percutaneously in vivo in 20 patients to obtain images of the iliac and superficial femoral artery. High quality real-time images were obtained. Normal vessels were seen showing pulsatile circular images with a hypoechoic muscular media resulting in a typical three-layered appearance.

A critical question, both in terms of computational ease and practical usefulness, is how best to aggregate or section the available data into appropriate road segments for operational and safety analyses. This issue is becoming more pertinent with the development of tools such as Interactive Highway Safety Design Model and the Highway Safety Manual, which require a logical partition of roads based on many different attributes. The guidance on how to do this however is rather scant. Analysis of traffic exposure versus crash risk is also affected by using fixed or variable length segments.

40|$|Professor A. Zecca, kindly rose some {{questions}} [1] on reso-nant structures {{observed in a}} recent positron–helium scat-tering experiment in Trento [2]. Obviously, any resonant features, in particular in helium [3] are always subject to confirmation or dismissal [4], so in first instance {{we are waiting for}} new experiments. Extensive details of Trento measurements in He are given in our common paper [5]; here I discuss two points: (1) the energy resolution of the apparatus and (2) the interpretation of these resonant structures. 1. A decisive way to determine the energy resolution are measurements on some resonant structures, like the 2 Πu resonance in N 2 or the (1 s 2 s 2) 2 S in He. In Trento ap-paratus careful checks using a thermoionic cathode placed in front of the scattering cell were done around 2 eV for electron scattering on N 2; the monochromating action is due to a weak guiding magnetic field. As stated by Zecca et al. [6] “the energy resolution of our apparatus as de-duced from these measurements is about 130 meV”. Two more elements contribute to tailoring the positron energy in Trento set-up. The moderator used and procedures of its thermal treatment were developed for our two previ-ous experiments: on positron annihilation in solids [7] and on intermediate-energy gas scattering [8]. We agree [1, 2] that the spectrum of re-emitted positrons from micron-thin monocrystal W films is much better than from thick, ribbon-like tungsten. Finally, the 90 ◦ bend cuts any tail of the energy distribution larger than 1. 6 eV FWHM; this is valid also for electrons, contrary to the value 4 – 5 eV as stated in [9]. 2.

Because of this, many authors have created different versions of this kind of test in order to generate statistics which are more precise in identifying the presence of a unit root. Some authors have increased the power of these statistics using panel data. However, the use of panel data brings the possibility of dependence between cross-sections, this has been initially handled by the independence between cross-sections hypothesis. Only the second generation tests consider dependence between cross-sections. Nevertheless, in the literature there is no test which allows changes in the dependence between cross-sections over time. Thus, this paper uses Monte Carlo experiments to analyze the small sample properties of some statistics used to identify the presence of a unit root. It is noticed that the size of these statistics has a large distortion when the level of dependence between <b>cross-sections</b> <b>changes.</b> Teste de raiz unitÃria tem sido muito importante no sentido de validar ou rejeitar as hipÃteses dos modelos econÃmicos. Devido essa importÃncia, diversos autores tÃm criado diferentes versÃes desse teste, a fim de gerar estatÃsticas que sejam mais precisas em identificar a presenÃa de raiz unitÃria. Usando dados em painel, alguns autores conseguiram aumentar o poder dessas estatÃsticas. No entanto, o uso de dados em painel trÃs a possibilidade de dependÃncia cross-section nos dados, fato esse inicialmente tratado pela hipÃtese de independÃncia cross-section. Somente nos testes chamados de segunda geraÃÃo Ã que se trata dependÃncia cross-section. Entretanto, nÃo hÃ na literatura nenhum teste que permita mudanÃas nesse nÃvel de dependÃncia ao longo do tempo. Com isso, esse trabalho pretende avaliar, por meio de um experimento de Monte Carlo, as propriedades de pequenas amostras de algumas estatÃsticas usadas para identificar a presenÃa de raiz unitÃria. Percebe-se que o tamanho dessas estatÃsticas sofre uma grande distorÃÃo para as situaÃÃes de mudanÃa no nÃvel de dependÃncia cross-section...|$|R
40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{optical properties}} of three porphyrin derivatives (T 3, 4 BCEMPP, T 4 CEMPP and TPP) doped in boric acid glass were probed using the Z-scan technique at different argon-ion laser wavelengths. The nonlinear transmission characteristics of T 3, 4 BCEMPP and T 4 CEMPP exhibit saturable absorption at 457. 9 nm and 476. 5 nm while these {{are dominated by}} excited state absorption at 488. 0 nm. However, {{in the case of}} TPP, the excited state absorption dominates the nonlinear characteristics except at 457. 9 nm. The experimental observations are explained by using the four-level saturable absorber model. Saturation intensity, excited state absorption <b>cross-section,</b> light-induced <b>changes</b> in the absorption and the refractive index along with its sign were determined at these argon-ion laser wavelengths. Furthermore, optical limiting characteristics of these samples were studied. The observed limiting action is consistent with the Z-scan studies...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{mathematical}} theory of time-harmonic wave propagation and reflection in a two-dimensional random acoustic waveguide with sound soft boundary and turning points. The boundary has small fluctuations {{on the scale}} of the wavelength, modeled as random. The waveguide supports multiple propagating modes. The number of these modes changes due to slow variations of the waveguide <b>cross-section.</b> The <b>changes</b> occur at turning points, where waves transition from propagating to evanescent or the other way around. We consider a regime where scattering at the random boundary has significant effect on the wave traveling from one turning point to another. This effect is described by the coupling of its components, the modes. We derive the mode coupling theory from first principles, and quantify the randomization of the wave and the transport and reflection of power in the waveguide. We show in particular that scattering at the random boundary may increase or decrease the net power transmitted through the waveguide depending on the source. Comment: 45 pages, 6 figur...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} in detail a novel {{formulation of the}} method of characteristics for its application to solve one-dimensional compressible unsteady non-homentropic flow advected along porous wall channels. In particular, the method is implemented into a wall-flow monolith Diesel particulate filter model whose purpose is the pressure drop prediction. The flow inside the monolith channels {{is considered to be}} one-dimensional and the flow through the porous wall treated as a source term agree with the Darcy’s law. The flow dynamic behaviour at internal nodes of the channels is solved by means of shock capturing methods, whereas the end nodes, or boundary conditions, are solved applying the method of characteristics. The derived solution in this study of the Riemann variables and the entropy level includes the variation along the space–time plane due to <b>cross-section</b> area <b>changes,</b> friction and heat transfer as traditionally stated, but also takes into account the key influence on every line of the flow leaving or entering to the channels through the porous walls...|$|R
