25|$|Some {{microphones}} such as condenser microphones require power. An {{alternative to}} battery power is phantom power, {{which consists of}} direct current applied equally through the two signal lines of a balanced audio connector, usually a three-pin XLR connector. The supply voltage is referenced to the ground pin of the <b>connector</b> (<b>pin</b> 1 of an XLR), which normally {{is connected to the}} cable shield or a ground wire in the cable or both. Phantom power is usually supplied at a nominal 48 volts DC, although lower voltages are permissible and modern microphones will often operate over a wide range.|$|E

5000|$|Different {{manufacturers}} of 8P8C modular jacks arrange for the pins of the 8P8C modular connector jack {{to be linked}} to wire connectors (often IDC type terminals) that are in a different physical arrangement from that of other manufacturers: Thus, for example, if a technician is in the habit of connecting the white/orange wire to the [...] "bottom right hand" [...] IDC terminal, which links it to 8P8C modular <b>connector</b> <b>pin</b> 1, in jacks made by other manufacturers this terminal may instead connect to 8P8C modular <b>connector</b> <b>pin</b> 2 (or any other pin). Labels and manufacturer's documentation should be consulted whenever an unfamiliar connector is first encountered.|$|E
50|$|The {{definitions}} of the two ends of the link are asymmetric. This makes the assignment {{of the role of}} a newly developed device problematic; the designer must decide on either a DTE-like or DCE-like interface and which <b>connector</b> <b>pin</b> assignments to use.|$|E

50|$|If one has {{specified}} wires {{within a}} cable (for instance, the colored Ethernet cable wires in TIA/EIA-568-B), then {{the order in}} which different color wires are attached to different <b>connector</b> <b>pins</b> defines the wiring scheme. Different ways of wiring numbered <b>connector</b> <b>pins</b> at the two ends of a cable creates different assemblies, which may appear identical but behave differently. The cross-reference between the contacts, or pins, of an electrical connector, and their functions is called pinout. There are many different pinouts for various connectors exists.|$|R

50|$|Crimp Contact is a <b>connector</b> <b>pin</b> or socket whose {{back portion}} (wire barrel) is a hollow {{cylinder}} into which a stripped wire (conductor) is inserted.

50|$|The damage can {{be spread}} over a large area, when the source is a {{relatively}} distant energy radiator, or a very small (though possibly deep) area, when the body comes to a {{direct contact with the}} source (e.g. a wire or a <b>connector</b> <b>pin).</b>|$|E

50|$|CompactPCI is a {{computer}} bus interconnect for industrial computers, combining a Eurocard-type connector and PCI signaling and protocols. Boards are standardized to 3U or 6U sizes, and are typically interconnected via a passive backplane. The <b>connector</b> <b>pin</b> assignments are standardized by the PICMG US and PICMG Europe organizations. The connectors and the electrical rules allow for eight boards in a PCI segment. Multiple bus segments are allowed with bridges.|$|E
50|$|Originally, the {{motherboard}} was {{powered by}} one 20-pin connector. An ATX power supply provides {{a number of}} peripheral power connectors and (in modern systems) two connectors for the motherboard: a 4-pin auxiliary connector providing additional power to the CPU and a main 24-pin power supply connector, {{an extension of the}} original 20-pin version. 20-pin MOLEX 39-29-9202 at the motherboard. 20-pin MOLEX 39-01-2200 at the cable. The <b>connector</b> <b>pin</b> pitch is 4.2 mm (one sixth of an inch).|$|E
50|$|Pin headers {{are often}} {{associated}} with ribbon cable <b>connectors,</b> <b>pin</b> headers often also function as recipients for jumpers. The most common jumper spacing is 2.54 mm, though 2.0 mm is sometimes used in smaller products.|$|R

50|$|A {{general rule}} is that DCE devices provide the clock signal (internal clocking) and the DTE device synchronizes on the {{provided}} clock (external clocking). D-sub connectors follow another rule for pin assignment. DTE devices usually transmit on <b>pin</b> <b>connector</b> number 2 and receive on <b>pin</b> <b>connector</b> number 3. DCE devices are just the opposite: <b>pin</b> <b>connector</b> number 2 receives and <b>pin</b> <b>connector</b> number 3 transmits the signals.|$|R
5000|$|Pin 1 is {{typically}} indicated {{on the body}} of the connector by a red or raised [...] "V" [...] mark. The corresponding wire in a ribbon cable is usually indicated by red coloration, a raised molded ridge, or markings printed onto the cable insulation. On the <b>connector</b> <b>pin</b> 2 is opposite pin 1, pin 3 is next to pin 1 {{along the length of the}} connector, and so on. On the cable, the wire connected to pin 2 is next to the wire connected to pin 1 (the red coded wire), and so on.|$|E
50|$|Onanon is a design, {{engineering}} and manufacturing company {{specializing in the}} automating panel array manufacturing process, which can produce multiple units in a single session. The company utilizes engineered plastics for manufacturing, using high-speed machinery and automation to produce connectors in large batches. The process removes the need for human handling, thus reducing the probability of error. Onanon utilizes printed circuit boards as a base to add other components. Headquartered in Milpitas, California, Onanon is the first company to introduce a PC board as a <b>connector</b> <b>pin</b> substrate. A technique which is considered standard today but was seen as revolutionary at the time.|$|E

5000|$|If {{using an}} ATX PSU for {{purposes}} other than powering an ATX motherboard, {{power can be}} fully turned on (it is always partly on to operate [...] "wake-up" [...] devices) by shorting the [...] "power-on" [...] pin on the ATX <b>connector</b> (<b>pin</b> 16, green wire) to a black wire (ground), {{which is what the}} power button on an ATX system does. At least the specified minimum load required by the PSU should be present; the standard does not specify operation without load and a conforming PSU may shut down, output incorrect voltages, or otherwise malfunction, but will not be hazardous or damaged.|$|E
50|$|OM2 and OM2 MD cameras had the {{accessory}} shoe 2 or 3 for attaching a flash unit. This had the central sync contact plus one other (either in-line or {{off to the}} 10-o-clock position when viewed {{from the rear of}} the camera) and a single, threaded post on the prism used to secure the shoe or a post with one small recess for a <b>connector</b> <b>pin</b> (Shoe 3). Additionally, the OM2 and OM2 MD models had a re-set position on the shutter speed dial adjacent to the B setting. This was used to re-set the shutter mechanism in the event of mirror lock-up when the batteries were drained.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{ambiguous}} situation arises {{with the}} connectors used for USB, FireWire (IEEE-1394), HDMI, and Thunderbolt serial data bus connections. Close examination of these connectors {{reveals that the}} contact [...] "pins" [...] are not actually pins, but instead are conductive surfaces that slide past each other when they mate. Therefore, the traditional pin and socket nomenclature is not applicable. Instead, most computer hardware people fall back to referring to the wrap-around metal shield on the plug connector {{as if it were}} a <b>connector</b> <b>pin.</b> By this convention, the connectors on serial bus cables are [...] "male plugs", and the corresponding connectors on equipment are [...] "female jacks".|$|E
