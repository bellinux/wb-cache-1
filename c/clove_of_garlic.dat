60|$|The Uggards are, or fancy themselves, a warlike race: {{nowhere in}} those distant seas {{are there any}} islanders so vain of their {{military}} power, the consciousness of which they acquired chiefly by fighting one another. Many years ago, however, they had a war {{with the people of}} another island kingdom, called Wug. The Wuggards held dominion over a third island, Scamadumclitchclitch, whose people had tried to throw off the yoke. In order to subdue them--at least to tears--it was decided to deprive them of garlic, the sole article of diet known to them and the Wuggards, and in that country dug out of the ground like coal. So the Wuggards in the rebellious island stopped up all the garlic mines, supplying their own needs by purchase from foreign trading proas. Having few cowrie shells, with which to purchase, the poor Scamadumclitchclitchians suffered a great distress, which so touched the hearts of the compassionate Uggards--a most humane and conscientious people--that they declared war against the Wuggards and sent a fleet of proas to the relief of the sufferers. The fleet established a strict blockade of every port in Scamadumclitchclitch, and not a <b>clove</b> <b>of</b> <b>garlic</b> could enter the island. That compelled the Wuggard army of occupation to reopen the mines for its own subsistence.|$|E

5000|$|There are {{additionally}} three unique helmets that Wario can obtain, {{with their}} own abilities. The Bull Helmet increases Wario's strength and doubles {{the length of his}} shoulder charge attack, allowing him to smash through blocks more easily. It also gives Wario the abilities to stick onto ceilings and perform a [...] "butt stomp" [...] into the ground which stuns nearby enemies and breaks through blocks underneath him. The Jet Helmet increases Wario's running speed and lets him fly in purely horizontal directions in the air, as well as to shoulder charge underwater. Finally, the Dragon Helmet lets Wario shoot long-ranged bursts of flames both on land and underwater, which destroy enemies and blocks on contact. This attack replaces his shoulder charge so long as he wears the Dragon Helmet. Players can also collect a Starman to gain temporary invincibility. If Wario takes damage from an opponent or obstacle, he will shrink, losing his shoulder charge move, and will remain small until he collects a <b>clove</b> <b>of</b> <b>garlic,</b> a helmet, or the end of the level. If Wario is hit while small, or is hit by an instant kill obstacle, such as pits or lava, he will lose a life and all the coins he had collected in that level.|$|E

This is equally true in terms of taste, as the work of professor Luc Pénicaud from the Center for Taste and Feeding Behavior (CSGA) appears to attest. According to him, the most opportune period to learn to like a new food is between the ages of 4 months and 2 years. Even better, in this time period we also learn to regulate our eating objectively. The child remembers the effects of absorbing a given food and adapts his behavior accordingly, and this for a long time. This would explain a very old béarnaise tradition that consists of rubbing a <b>clove</b> <b>of</b> <b>garlic</b> on the lips of newborns to instill in them the penchant for the odorous cloves...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} review the {{different}} pharmacological effects of garlic. Garlic, Allium sativum, is a herbal plant which {{has been used in}} different food preparations since long time. Many studies have shown that allicin is the main compound in garlic which is generated from alliin with the help of alliinase enzyme and is responsible for many pharmacological effects. Different studies have shown that garlic has pharmacological effects such as antihypertensive, antihypercholesterolaemic, antiplatelet, hypoglycaemic, cardioprotective, antimicrobial, antineoplastic, etc. However, studies in the literature have some confl icting fi ndings and meta-analyses are also slightly different for different effects. Despite these fi ndings, most of the studies, including meta-analyses, have shown signifi cant antihypertensive and hypolipidaemic effects of garlic. Based on the data in the literature, regular dietary consumption of raw garlic, two to four grams, equivalent to one <b>clove</b> <b>of</b> <b>garlic,</b> or 600 - 900 mg garlic powder per day, if not contraindicated, may be effective for different benefi cial pharmacological effects...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Hyperlipidemia and {{increased}} degree of oxidative stress {{are among the}} important risk factors for Atherosclerosis in renal transplant recipients (RTR). The Medical treatment of hyperlipidemia in RTR because of drugs side effects has been problematic, therefore alternative methods such as using of Garlic as an effective material in cholesterol lowering and inhibition of LDL Oxidation has been noted. For evaluation of garlic effect on RTR, 50 renal transplant patients with stable renal function were selected and divided into 2 groups. They took one <b>clove</b> <b>of</b> <b>garlic</b> (1 gr) by chewing or swallowing for two months, after one month wash-out period, they took garlic by the other route. Results indicated that although lipid profile, BUN, Cr, serum levels of cyclosporine and diastolic blood pressure did not change, Systolic blood pressure decreased from 138. 2 to 132. 8 mmHg (p= 0. 001) and Malondialdehyde (MDA) decreased from 2. 4 to 1. 7 nmol/ml (p= 0. 009) by swallowing route, Cholesterol decreased from 205. 1 to 195. 3 mg/dl (p= 0. 03), triglyceride decreased from 195. 7 to 174. 8 mg/dl (p= 0. 008), MDA decreased from 2. 5 to 1. 6 nmol/ml (p= 0. 001), systolic blood pressure decreased from 137. 5 to 129. 8 mmHg (p= 0. 001), diastolic blood pressure decreased from 84. 6 to 77. 6 mmHg (p= 0. 001) and Cr decreased from 1. 51 to 1. 44 mg/dl (p= 0. 03) by chewing route too. However HDL, LDL and cyclosporine serum levels had no significant differences by both of swallowing and chewing routes. We conclude that undamaged garlic (swallowed) had no lowering effect on lipid level of serum. But Crushed garlic (chewed) reduces cholesterol, triglyceride, MDA and blood pressure. Additionally creatinine reduced without notable decrease in cyclosporine serum levels {{may be due to}} cyclosporine nephrotoxicity ameliorating effect of garlic...|$|E
