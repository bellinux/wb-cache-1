In this paper, {{we focus on the}} continuous and periodic distinct values estimation over sliding windows. We propose a <b>compound</b> <b>sliding</b> window model to compute the distinct values over basic sliding windows in an incremental way. LDV, HDV and AHDV are the three algorithms that are based on <b>compound</b> <b>sliding</b> windows. The basic idea behind the <b>compound</b> <b>sliding</b> windows is to organize the basic windows into a Hash table according to distinct values. Whenever a new data arrives at the data stream, it is inserted into a basic window. Once the basic window is full, a scan using distinct values is executed and the distinct values number is updated incrementally.

40|$|The Haast Pass highway {{has had a}} {{long history}} of {{instability}} since it was constructed in 1960. Steep slopes and deeply incised river create an actively changing geomorphic environment making maintaining the highway corridor hazardous and difficult. This thesis study provides the first comprehensive investigation of the highway corridor between the Summit and Thunder Creek Falls using LiDAR and detailed air-photo analysis to provide the basis for geomorphic mapping. Management of slope hazards to date has been based on a reactive approach treating the immediate unstable areas around landslides after they occur. This study presents the first large-scale geomorphological assessment of the highway corridor identifying surface unit type, slope processes and slope hazards in order to facilitate the development of a long-term highway management strategy. Because dense vegetation covers nearly all the slopes above the highway in the study area as as such, it has not been possible to adequately investigate slope geomorphology until the availability of LiDAR. This study is the first to use Light direction and ranging[LiDAR] for corridor hazard mapping beneath dense vegetation in New Zealand. The LiDAR survey was flown by New Zealand Aerial Mapping in January 2014 for the New Zealand Transport Agency and was provided for use in this study. The LiDAR surface model created serves as the basis for mapping surface units and landslide features, enabling the identification of slope processes and landslide hazards. Aerial photos were also used to identify surface unit type and slope processes where vegetation was absent and enabled the activity of slopes to be evaluated. Interpretations made using LiDAR were validated using aerial photography and targeted ground truthing with all ground truthing sites confirming the interpretations made. Large scale geomorphology mapping was undertaken on slopes above the highway on the western side of the valley and showed that there were distinct differences between the southern and northern parts of the highway corridor. Between The Haast Pass Summit and Pipson Creek the slopes are dominated by schist bedrock with regolith confined to small deposits next to the highway and larger deposits in tributary valleys. The slope hazards affecting the highway in this zone are confined to debris sliding and rockfall from regolith deposits and bedrock cliffs next to the highway between Robinson and Pipson Creeks. The slopes between Pipson Creek and the Gates of Haast, in contrast, consist of deep regolith deposits and regolith veneered slopes. Evidence of active and recently active slope processes on the slopes facing the highway confirm the instability is associated with slope hazards including debris flows, debris slides, rock fall and highway collapse. Small-scale detailed evaluations were undertaken at Diana Falls, Ford Creek, The Hinge and the Gates of Haast with the sites selected based on their history of instability and/or their particu- larly hazardous appearance during the large-scale geomorphology and hazard identification. Using the LiDAR surface model surface units and landslide features were identified and mapped with small-scale engineering geomorphology maps. This information was then used to interpret the subsurface geometry and the failure mode/slope processes acting on the slope enabling an assessment of the current stability and future slope development to be made. Diana Falls was found to have scarps and tension cracks running across the regolith covered slope indicating that future landslides from this site will be an ongoing problem. At Ford Creek the landslide was identified as a rock <b>compound</b> <b>slide,</b> but assessments of its current stability and future development were unable to be made. Detailed investigations at The Hinge revealed evidence of a large creeping debris slide and the existence smaller debris slides below the highway through the entire investigation area; the debris slides identified show signs of activity and continued debris sliding will continue to affect the highway in the future. The investigation of the Gates of Haast revealed that the slope instability is not as extensive as {{it has been in the}} past, however, recent rock slides and debris flows have continued affect the highway and will continue to pose a hazard in the future. This thesis provides fundamental information required to develop a comprehensive management plan for the Haast Pass highway corridor between the Haast Pass summit and the Gates of Haast. A new landslide management plan has been developed outlining immediate, short-term and long- term options and programmes that should be implemented. Immediate options are steps that can be taken to quickly increase the safety of road users and include moving of highway closure gates and installation of warning signage. Short-term options aim to mitigate landslide hazards where feasible including the installation of rockfall barriers and debris flow attenuators, and lay the groundwork for future avoidance of hazards by undertaking investigations of highway realignment and developing highway closure rainfall thresholds. Long-term options are recommended where landslides will continue to impact the same section of the highway repeatedly and focus on hazard avoidance by building landslide shelters or major highway realignments. The adoption of a management plan ensures security of the highway, protects against loss of life and provides the most cost effective long-term solution to manage the landsliding hazards...|$|E

40|$|The {{scope of}} the paper {{encompasses}} planar and <b>compound</b> <b>sliding</b> motions, which may exhibit creeping behaviour during a certain period but may evolve to a very rapid motion. Thermo-mechanical interactions, at {{the scale of the}} sliding surface, are accepted as a critical aspect to explain these motion phases and their relationship. The sliding kinetics and global equilibrium are described at a large scale and the evolving shearing strength at the sliding surface derives from the local analysis of the shearing band and its vicinity. Pore pressures, temperatures and related variables are calculated by resolving a set of balance equations. The paper describes the transition from creeping motions to a rapid event. Results are found in terms of dimensionless numbers. Calculation of the slide evolution requires special numerical techniques described in the paper. Band permeability is found to be the dominant property controlling the triggering of fast motions. The creeping stage and the eventual slide blow-up are intimately linked. This relationship is explored in the paper. The models presented can be readily used to back-analyse relevant case histories or, in principle, even to carry out predictive modelling, provided an adequate calibration is available for the material parameters.

The presence of several phenilalanine residues in the only binding pocket identified by X-ray has inspired an experimental work where the effects of single point Phe->Ala mutations on the MIC and on the efflux of several antibiotics have been determined [1, 2]. Concerning the MICs, interestingly, the mutation F 610 A has been shown to significantly reduce the minimum inhibitory concentration of doxorubicin and many other substrates, although F 610 does not appear to interact strongly with them or to be involved in the squeezing mechanism of the binding pocket suggested as preliminary step of the extrusion process. In this work, we assess the impact of the experimental mutations on the functionality of AcrB by means of computational techniques, using doxorubicin and minocycline as substrates. We found that for F 610 A the <b>compounds</b> <b>slide</b> deeply inside the binding pocket after mutation, increasing the strength of the interaction.

40|$|The {{expression}} "landslide from massive rock slope failure" (MRSF) is used {{to indicate}} large-scale landslides characterised {{by a variety of}} complex initial failure processes and unpredictable postfailure behaviour. In this context, deep-seated landslides are classified as "landslides from massive rock slope failure". Typically, deep-seated landslides are slow mountain deformations which may involve movement along discrete shear surfaces and deep seated mass creep. The long-term development of deep-seated slope deformations creates suitable conditions for the subsequent occurrence of other slope deformations. Deep-seated landslides in mountain areas can be spatially interconnected with other types of slope deformations such as debris flows, debris slides, rock avalanches, topple, translational, rotational and <b>compound</b> <b>sliding</b> and complex type of mass movements. It is to be recognized that many aspects of large-scale landslides need be investigated in order to gain the necessary confidence in the understanding and prediction of their behaviour and in the associated risk assessment. The present thesis is to contribute to such understanding with specific reference to a number of mass movements which characterize large-scale landslides. An advanced numerical technique (FDEM) which combines finite elements with discrete elements has been applied in this thesis for improving such understanding. The open source research code, called Y 2 D, developed at the Queen Mary, University of London by Prof. Munjiza has been used. Considering that this code has not yet been applied to slope stability problems, a series of numerical tests have been carried out to assess its suitability to properly and efficiently simulate geomechanical problems. To this purpose standard rock failure mechanisms as well as laboratory tests have been modelled first and the results obtained have been compared with available analytical and numerical solutions. The advantages of the application of FDEM has been outlined by showing that both the simulation of failure initiation and progressive development to fragmentation of the rock mass is possible as this is deposited at the slope toe. The case study of interest for this thesis is the Beauregard massive landslide located in the Aosta Valley (Northwestern Italy). At this site the presence of an extensive deep-landslide insisting on the left abutment of an arch-gravity dam is well recognised. Based on detailed studies, the investigated area has been subdivided into zones which are characterised by different geomorphologic and geostructural features. Different landslide mechanics as well as different landslide activities upstream of the dam site have been identified and studied in detail. Such an area is thought to be at an intermediate stage of development of the deep seated landslide compared with the sector which insists on the dam. The observed failure mechanism has been ascribed to a large <b>sliding</b> on a <b>compound</b> surface. Some other failure mechanisms have been recognized, such as large flexural toppling and local block toppling instability. The final part of the thesis has been devoted to the FDEM numerical modelling of a large scale failure mechanism based on brittle behaviour of the rock mass. The aim is to apply the "total slope failure" approach through the application of FDEM. Such a technique has demonstrated the significant potential in predicting the development of possible slope instability phenomen...|$|R

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{was part of}} the session : Pedagogy: Procedures, Scaffolds, Strategies, Tactics 24 th National Conference on the Beginning Design StudentShop safety courses have long been the only way to introduce beginning design students to the tools, methods and appropriate behaviors in the shop environment. These courses and programs are geared towards providing important knowledge so the student can successfully engage the shop. However, they lack hands on experience and can often lead to creating a culture of fear with some students around certain tools and operations. The wood shop acclimation project is executed shortly after students take the shop safety course and prior to being asked to make anything in the shop on their own. It is provided to allow for greater hands on instruction for each student, creating in the students a better sense of confidence in operating the equipment safely and efficiently. The project was conceived as a way to efficiently mass produce a specific item that each student would be required to build to support their current studio project in some way, as a site or as a display. The faculty designs these items and the students would be shown why the item was designed the way it was. Often highlighting economy of means as major design consideration. Since each project always uses plywood as its main material the dimensions of that sheet in relation to each item's components are carefully calculated to minimize scrap. Instilling in the students an important lesson in valuing material. A step-by-step process is designed and laid out for the students. It takes them from a full sheet of plywood to the final assembled item. Along the way certain tools such as the panel saw, table saw and <b>compound</b> <b>sliding</b> miter saw are described {{in terms of what they}} do well and why they are being chosen to perform the specific operation in the process. As an extension to the shop safety course, students are given three concepts to apply to each tool in order to operate it safely and without damage to it, them or the material. These concepts are feed, guide and support and are described at each part of the process on each tool. This gives the students a starting point to correctly evaluate how they need to use the machines properly. Lastly throughout the process students are given an introduction into the appropriate use of jigs and fixtures to aid in the process of mass-producing the item. This stresses the importance of planning out the sequence of how you make something as well as supporting the decision of which tool to use for a specific operation. For example a sled is made for the table saw with multiple fixtures attached to it allowing each part to be cut efficiently and precisely with out measuring that can often lead to error. Also assembly jigs are made so that holes can be drilled identically without the need to measure and mark. The wood shop acclimation project not only serves as an important safety and instructional tool but also as a means to show the students via the design process a way to consider construction, fabrication sequencing and logic related to material and fabrication processes. And most importantly instill in the students a high level of knowledge driven comfort in engaging the wood shop...|$|R

The San Piero and the Podere Mezzavia DsGSDs affect {{the lower part of the}} slope. The main escarpments are located on the outer edges of the lava flows, but the landslides mostly affect the pre-volcanic Ligurian Terrains. A deeper movement, possibly exceeding 100 m in thickness, is evidenced by a long trench at the base of the main escarpment that indicates a sagging type movement. This deeper movement is responsible for the activation of a series of superficial rock and mud flows that show evidence of ongoing activity. The most likely location of the sliding surface is the tectonized contact between the Santa Fiora and Argille a Palombini Fms within the Ligurian units, although the superficial landslides prevent our determining with certainty if a clear-cut sliding surface already developed connecting the upper and the lower parts of the slope. These DsGSDs were activated along the flanks of a larger movement that affects the lava flow units cropping out in the middle slope of the volcano. A long main escarpment, secondary escarpments, trenches and borehole data suggest that the thickness could locally exceed 200 m and generate another sagging type movement.

Analogs of one of these classes of inhibitors, the long side-chain variolins, cannot bind to the adenosyl pocket of the closed conformation of AsnRS due to steric clashes, though the short side-chain variolins identified by SLIDE apparently bind isosterically with adenosine. We hypothesized that an open conformation of the motif 2 loop also permits the long side-chain variolins to bind in the adenosine pocket and that their selectivity for Brugia relative to human AsnRS can be explained by differences in the sequence and conformation of this loop. Loop flexibility sampling using Rigidity Optimized Conformational Kinetics (ROCK) confirms this possibility, while scoring of the relative affinities of the different ligands by SLIDE correlates well with the compounds' ranks in inhibition assays. Combining ROCK and SLIDE provides a promising approach for exploiting conformational flexibility in structure-based screening and design of species selective inhibitors. Sai Chetan K.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a novel microarray based proteomics platform technology that can rapidly assemble diverse multicomponent reactions without cross-contamination or the need for surface linkage. It can perform multiple on-chip enzymatic assays in the liquid phase, using biological fluids, at nanoliter volumes with minimal evaporation, minimal sample consumption and is highly reproducible. The proposed technology is compatible with standard microarraying and spot-analysis tools. Using glycerol-based buffers, {{we are able to}} microarray chemical <b>compounds</b> onto glass <b>slides</b> at 400 spots/cm 2 with each spot having a reaction volume of ∼ 1. 6 nL. Aerosol deposition allows metered delivery of biological samples, subsequent reagents and water into each reaction center in the entire microarray. The method can be utilized for both for homogenous fluorescence assays and label-free assays using MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry (MS). The technology platform is amenable to a variety of diverse proteomics applications such as profiling of protease-substrate interactions, complex protease mixtures such as blood, and high throughput screening reactions. ^ A 722 -member library of fluorogenic protease substrates of the general format Ac-Ala-X-X-(Arg/Lys) -coumarin was synthesized (X = all natural amino acids except cysteine) to map protease-substrate interactions. Specificities of 19 serine proteases and 11 cysteine proteases were obtained from 129, 960 separate microarray fluorogenic. ^ Using this library, we were also able to determine optimal substrates for various coagulation proteases, which overcame the cross-reactivity and non-specificity of currently available substrates. These optimal substrates were able to accurately determine the presence of different proteases from a complex mixture like plasma and can be potentially used for biomarker discovery, diagnosing various coagulopathies or functional phenotyping. ^ A potent cathepsin L inhibitor, MDL 28170, was identified from a 1000 -compound inhibitor library using our method. Cathepsin L has been implicated in the mechanism of action for SARS-CoV membrane fusion and viral entry. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an acute respiratory illness caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The compound MDL 28170 was able to potently and specifically inhibit pseudotype infection mediated by SARS-CoV and reduced live SARS-CoV replication. Additionally, a novel inhibitor of caspases 2, 4, and 6 was also identified from a 352 -compound combinatorial library. ...|$|R
40|$|The racing {{situation}} {{requires a}} high performance tuned vehicle incorporating a high performance engine, aerodynamic body, and tyres. Among these three important factors the tyre {{is the only}} component which can transmit the vehicle force to the road, and {{is the most difficult}} part to tune, since it involves complex phenomena and a wide range of operating conditions. Development of a theoretical tyre model is necessitated to predict the tyre forces and moments according to various road conditions. Many empirical tyre models have been studied in the past as it is efficient to conduct experimental curve-fittings. However, these carry inherent problems from the unrealistic tyre testing equipment and conditions. On the other hand, the theoretical tyre model can purely simulate and make predictions taking into account the causes and effects of the tyre operating phenomena. Therefore, it can enhance the accuracy of the tuning and selection of the tyre. The aim of this research project was to provide an understanding of tread friction interacting with the road surface in various operating conditions in order to enhance the knowledge about the application to theoretical tyre model development. The approaches employed to achieve the research aim mainly involve experimental investigations and numerical simulations including the development and application of Gaussian/non-Gaussian surfaces at the contact interface in order to predict frictional behaviours of tread in a realistic way. The review and analyses of the literature involving the empirical and theoretical research field of tyres revealed that existing information regarding the effects on the complex interactions between tyre operating variables was found to be sparse and only qualitative. Recently, a great deal of improvement of theoretical tyre models has been made with innovative representation of road surface asperities. However, this surface model employs only a few simple shapes to represent the road asperity shapes. This should be further improved with inclusion of a greater variety of shapes. Currently the simulation software packages used for the tyre forces and moments prediction are mostly multi-body physics software packages such as MSC. ADAMS for the computing efficiency. In order to maximise the accuracy and evaluate the interaction phenomena in detail, FEA can be utilized. In order to evaluate the effects of important operating variables on frictional behaviours of tread, the main parts of the model: tread material properties and the surface roughness representations, were developed. Each part of the model was investigated separately and then applied to the model. Equivalent Gaussian/non-Gaussian surfaces were generated using the same roughness parameters, in order to assess the effects of these parameters on the friction corresponding to a given roughness. The friction tests were conducted with a unique testing apparatus and the experimental rig was designed based upon piezo-electric load cells such that the road surface was sliding over the tread rubber sheet. The experimental schedule was conceived with the aim of making consistent measurements in order to examine the data with respect to the causes and effects of the four individual experimental variables: tread <b>compound,</b> surface roughness, <b>sliding</b> velocity, and normal load. The experimental data were expressed in terms of the average friction coefficients over the sliding motion. The important model parameters which control the frictional behaviours were determined by a trial and error method to give a match between the friction test results and their simulation results. These parameters were the local friction coefficient corresponding to the effect of the microscopic texture of the contact bodies and the friction stress limit, which represents the limiting shear stress during friction. Comparisons were conducted to verify the validity of the FE models for the predictions with different conditions. Lastly, the prediction of friction for the load controlled (LC) mode, which is a more realistic tyre contact condition, was conducted, with the important model parameters obtained by comparison between the experimental results and their simulations. The effects of each variable on the friction of the tread was discussed in conjunction with the interaction of the operating variables. The conclusions derived from the research conducted to achieve each of these specific aims are summarised separately. These analyses led to the confirmation of the general and specific trends of the friction in contact between tyre tread and road surface. Specifically, the successful applications of the Gaussian/non-Gaussian surfaces enabled a discussion of the effects of each roughness parameters on tread friction. It has been revealed that not only the effects of the relative roughness could cause the variations in the apparent friction coefficient, but also more significantly the skewness and kurtosis could have the effects on the frictional behaviours of tread rubber, and should thus always be included in simulated surfaces. It has been verified that the FE model of the tread-road interaction as a tool to investigate the causes and effects of the operating variables can be used to predict the detailed interaction of the tread rubber and road asperities...|$|R
