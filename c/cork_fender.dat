60|$|From Ironbridge, {{two days}} later, they sailed {{with a general}} cargo for Stourwich, the Seamew picking her way {{carefully}} down the river by moonlight, followed at an ever-increasing distance by a <b>cork</b> <b>fender</b> of abandoned aspect.|$|E
60|$|The cook smiled indulgently, and, going aboard, {{left his}} {{youthful}} charge {{to give the}} best explanation he could of his absence to the skipper—an explanation which was marred for him by the childish behavior of the cook {{at the other end}} of the ship, who taking the part of Miss O’Brien for himself, gave that of Henry to a <b>cork</b> <b>fender,</b> which, when it became obstreperous—as it frequently did on the slightest provocation—he slapped vigorously, giving sundry falsetto howls, which he fondly imagined were in good imitation of Henry. After three encores the skipper stepped forward for enlightenment, returning to the mate with a grin so aggravating that the sensitive Henry was near to receiving a thrashing for insubordination of the most impertinent nature.|$|E
6000|$|The {{portable}} {{table was}} being put together for dinner {{to the left}} of the wheel by two pig-tailed [...] "boys," [...] who as usual snarled at each other over the job, while another, a doleful, burly, very yellow Chinaman, resembling Mr. Massy, waited apathetically with the cloth over his arm and a pile of thick dinner-plates against his chest. A common cabin lamp with its globe missing, brought up from below, had been hooked to the wooden framework of the awning; the side-screens had been lowered all round; Captain Whalley filling the depths of the wicker-chair seemed to sit benumbed in a canvas tent crudely lighted, and used for the storing of nautical objects; a shabby steering-wheel, a battered brass binnacle on a stout mahogany stand, two dingy life-buoys, an old <b>cork</b> <b>fender</b> lying in a corner, dilapidated deck-lockers with loops of thin rope instead of door-handles.|$|E
50|$|In total, Henry Greathead built 31 lifeboats. His {{eleventh}} boat, the Zetland {{built in}} 1802, saw 78 {{years of service}} in Redcar and saved over 500 lives {{with the loss of}} only one crew member. She normally had a crew of 13, but up to 20 could be needed in rough weather. Her <b>cork</b> <b>fenders</b> were replaced at some point by internal buoyancy tanks. This boat {{is the only one of}} Greathead's to survive, and is preserved at the RNLI Zetland Museum.|$|R
6000|$|He had {{rubbed the}} rope against Job's face {{in order to}} let him know it was there, but the man seemed to have lost all power to move. He simply {{maintained}} his death-grip until his strength gave way. Tommy understood his case, and looked quickly round for one of those ring-shaped lifebuoys which we are accustomed to see in our passenger steamers tied up so securely that they would in most cases of sudden emergency be utterly useless. But the owners of the [...] "Butterfly" [...] were economists. They did not think life-preserving worth the expenditure of a few shillings, so there was no lifebuoy to be found. There was a round <b>cork</b> <b>fender,</b> however, which the boy seized and flung into the sea, just as Job's grasp loosened. He uttered a wild shriek, and tossed up his arms imploringly, as he was carried away. The buoy fell close beside him, and he caught it. But it was scarce sufficient to sustain his weight, and merely prolonged the agonising struggle. Tommy soon lost sight of him in the darkness. Soon after there arose a wild fierce cry, so loud and strong that it seemed to have been uttered at the boy's elbow. Tommy shuddered, for it suggested the idea of a despairing soul.|$|E
5000|$|On 23 January 1897 the Norwegian brig Ispolen {{carrying}} a cargo of Ice, was under some distress. The Ispolen {{had been running}} through a storm for two days and had shipped {{a lot of water}} during that time. She had made for the coast hoping to seek help and headed for a steamer that was anchored offshore close to Cromer. The captain’s intention was to contact the steamer to find out if there was a local lifeboat nearby who could help. Unfortunately the wind and driving rain had blown her close to the shore and the watching local fisherman realised that she would soon be on the beach and raised the alarm. The Sheringham RNLI lifeboat William Bennett could not be launched from her station as her gangway and a section of the sea wall had been washed away in the same north westerly gale the previous day. Her crew had to drag the William Bennett on her carriage to the East gangway just below Beeston Hill where she could be launched. The Henry Ramey Upcher was also prepared for launch was soon at sea with Coxswain Barnes Cooper at the helm. By now it was 1:45pm and the Ispolen had now run aground just offshore. [...] In rapidly worsening situation the Henry Ramey Upcher had moved alongside the stricken vessel, but the crew who had been completely unprepared, had no ropes ready to tether the boats together. The result of this caused the lifeboat to collide with the Ispolen violently, damaging the lifeboat’s <b>cork</b> <b>fender</b> and snapping two of her oars. The lifeboats second approach was more successful when the lifeboat managed to secure the two boats together using grappling hooks thrown into the Ispolen’s fore-rigging. Holding the boats and in considerable risk to the lifeboat the crew of eight men were able to be transferred to the relative safety of the lifeboat. Shortly after the rescued men were landed at Sheringham. The news was passed on to the disappointed crewmen of the William Bennett as they were about to launch over at Beeston east gangway.|$|E
