60|$|It was the {{complaint}} and lamentation of prelates, upon every least breath of {{a motion to}} remove pluralities, and distribute more equally Church revenues, that then all learning would be for ever dashed and discouraged. But as for that opinion, I never found cause {{to think that the}} tenth part of learning stood or fell with the clergy: nor could I ever but hold it for a sordid and unworthy speech of any churchman who had a competency left him. If therefore ye be loath to dishearten utterly and discontent, not the mercenary crew of false pretenders to learning, but the free and ingenuous sort of such as evidently were born to study, and love learning for itself, not for lucre or any other end but the service of God and of truth, and perhaps that lasting fame and perpetuity of praise which God and good men have consented shall be the reward of those whose published labours advance the good of mankind; then know that, so far to distrust the judgment and the honesty of one who hath but a <b>common</b> <b>repute</b> in learning, and never yet offended, as not to count him fit to print his mind without a tutor and examiner, lest he should drop a schism, or something of corruption, is the greatest displeasure and indignity to a free and knowing spirit that can be put upon him.|$|E
6000|$|Sir,--When I first {{addressed}} you on {{the subject}} of the projected operations of the Salvation Army, all that I knew about that body was derived from the study of Mr. Booth's book, from <b>common</b> <b>repute,</b> and from occasional attention to the sayings and doings of his noisy squadrons, with which my walks about London, in past years, have made me familiar. I was quite unaware of the existence of evidence respecting the present administration of the Salvation forces, which would have enabled me to act upon the sagacious maxim of the American humourist, [...] "Don't prophesy unless you know." [...] The letter you were good enough to publish has brought upon me a swarm of letters and pamphlets. Some favour me with abuse; some thoughtful correspondents warmly agree with me, and then proceed to point out how much worthier certain schemes of their own are of my friend's support; some send valuable encouragement, for which I offer my hearty thanks, and ask them to excuse any more special acknowledgment. But that which I find most to the purpose, just now, is the revelation made by some of the documents which have reached me, of a fact of which I was wholly ignorant--namely, that [256] persons who have faithfully and zealously served in the Salvation Army, who express unchanged attachment to its original principles and practice, and who have been in close official relations with the [...] "General" [...] have publicly declared that the process of degradation of the organization into a mere engine of fanatical intolerance and personal ambition, which I declared was inevitable, has already set in and is making rapid progress.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Tis to this zeal, {{allowable}} in his function, that I forgive his citing {{as he does}} {{these words}} of mine (ch. xxviii. sect. II): [...] "Even the exhortations of inspired teachers have not feared to appeal to <b>common</b> <b>repute,</b> Philip, iv. 8;" [...] without taking notice of those immediately preceding, which introduce them, and run thus: [...] "Whereby even in the corruption of manners, the true boundaries {{of the law of}} nature, which ought to be the rule of virtue and vice, were pretty well preserved. So that even the exhortations of inspired teachers," [...] &c. By which words, and the rest of that section, it is plain that I brought that passage of St. Paul, not to prove that the general measure of what men called virtue and vice throughout the world was the reputation and fashion of each particular society within itself; but to show that, though it were so, yet, for reasons I there give, men, in that way of denominating their actions, did not for the most part much stray from the Law of Nature; which is that standing and unalterable rule by which they ought to judge of the moral rectitude and gravity of their actions, and accordingly denominate them virtues or vices. Had Mr. Lowde considered this, he would have found it little to his purpose to have quoted this passage in a sense I used it not; and would I imagine have spared the application he subjoins to it, as not very necessary. But I hope this Second Edition will give him satisfaction on the point, and that this matter is now so expressed as to show him there was no cause for scruple.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{decision}} theory under risk or uncertainty has for object {{to describe the}} behavior of agents facing several uncertainty perspectives, waited that every agent is characterized by preferences that are him clean. As {{it is difficult to}} describe these preferences exhaustively, we try to represent them: thus, while associating a numeric value to each uncertain perspective, we can order an agent's preferences as merely that one orders some real numbers. The recourse to a representative function of preferences (called as function value) constitutes a long time since the usual method of behavior description in uncertainty. The interest obvious of this method is to permit to integrate these data directly in a formalized model and, by extension, to understand the underlying optimization process to all decision. The determination of the representative function of preferences must rest on an axiomatic foundation. One hears by there that a certain number of rules or general behaviors (called axioms) are <b>reputed</b> <b>common</b> to all human beings. Of these axioms one will drift a precise specification of the function value. The objective {{of this paper is to}} examine the historic of theories having looked for to determine a satisfactory criteria to answer to the problem of decision under risk or uncertainty and to analyze the approach of these models. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{uses the}} {{entirety}} of Margaret Cavendish's archive to present the first full account of her thought within its historical context. Living in France, the Netherlands, and England, Cavendishâs ideas were honed {{and in some cases}} prompted by her correspondences with figures who were central to the Republic of Letters, such as Constantijn Huygens, Samuel SorbiÃ¨re, and Kenelm Digby. In their turn, a wide range of Cavendishâs contemporaries rigorously engaged with her publications. Bringing atomism from France to England, she encouraged Walter Charleton's translation of Pierre Gassendi's Animadversiones; Thomas Shadwellâs critique of the Royal Society in his popular satirical play, The Virtuoso, was based on The Blazing World; Arthur Annesley heavily annotated Cavendishâs De vita [...] . Guilielmi ducis Novo-Castrensis in preparing his own Latin history; Susan Du Verger wrote a folio-length response to Cavendishâs reflections on monasticism; and Nehemiah Grew read her medical treatise when developing his comparative anatomy. Far from being the eccentric and isolated "Mad Madge" of <b>common</b> <b>repute,</b> I recover Cavendish {{as one of the most}} prolific and philosophically informed English writers of the seventeenth century. When Cavendish's ideas have been studied in relation to those of other thinkers, she has usually been aligned with novatores, especially Thomas Hobbes and RenÃ© Descartes. While these figures were "philosophers" insofar as they held undergraduate degrees, they desired to cleanse philosophy of the Aristotelian detritus of the university curriculum in which it had long been submerged. Paradoxically, I show that it was precisely because of Cavendish's lack of a formal education that she was more willing to align herself with the universities, and with the mainstream of seventeenth-century thought, than Hobbes and Descartes. Pushing back on the historiographical consensus, I show that through her career-long dialogue with editions, commentaries, and translations of ancient mythology, history, and natural philosophy, Cavendish cleaved to Aristotelian principles and categories as an antidote to the intellectual and religious turmoil of her times. In doing so, I argue that she produced the first (and last) work of traditional natural philosophy composed wholly in the English vernacular. Rather than priming her to embrace a closed and dogmatic set of philosophical precepts, this thesis underscores the inherent plurality of Aristotelian natural philosophy. The first chapter studies Cavendish's 1653 Poems, and Fancies in relation to the mythological publications of Francis Bacon and George Sandys, and the atomic writing of Pierre Gassendi and Thomas Harriot. Turning from her atomism, the second chapter discusses the material spirits of her 1653 Philosophicall Fancies and her 1655 Philosophical and Physical Opinions. It demonstrates that Cavendishâs opposition to the mathematical and mechanical corpuscles of Descartes, and her interest in the traditions of Galenic and chymical medicine, inspired this shift in her substance theory. The third chapter moves from one higher discipline to the next by studying the theological ideas of Cavendishâs 1664 Philosophical Letters. It argues that she developed a Reformed Anglican theology against the heterodox Platonic philosophy and cabalistic theology of Henry More and Joseph Glanvill. Shifting the target of her criticism, the fourth chapter finally studies how Cavendish manipulated Thomas Stanley's History of Philosophy to critique the Royal Society in her 1666 Observations Upon Experimental Philosophy and the Blazing World. Bookended by the influences of Gassendi and Thomas Stanley, Cavendish manipulated the more discursive and hermeneutic modes of Aristotelian thought to cultivate a continuum between literature as imaginative writing and literae humaniores as an embodiment of the encyclopaedia of learning. By building on methodologies not only from literary history, but also from the histories of science, philosophy, and scholarship, my work shows that Cavendish's oeuvre is one of the most powerful examples of the degree to which the seventeenth-century realms of the "new philosophy", literature, and learning were intertwined. </p...|$|E
