2500|$|Once {{the union}} is in the field its members <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> from growing if they know how, and our man knows how. Meetings can be set far apart.

However, these tactics may not be good, and the union spirit may be so strong that a big organization cannot be prevented. In this case our man turns extremely radical. He asks for unreasonable things and keeps the union embroiled in trouble. If a strike comes, {{he will be the}} loudest man in the bunch, and will counsel violence and get somebody in trouble. The result will be that the union will be broken up." ...|$|E
