2500|$|The {{leader of}} the United Democratic Movement, Bantu Holomisa, issued a press release {{strongly}} in favour of charging Zuma. He stated that [...] "we [...] hope that this was merely phase one of the prosecution process: Schabir Shaik has been prosecuted as the <b>corruptor.</b> Phase two must necessarily be to prosecute the corruptee. It would be an embarrassment {{for the country to}} have a serving deputy president arrested and prosecuted. Therefore President Mbeki must fire Mr Zuma if he does not resign". The press report concluded by saying that the 15-year jail sentence was confirmation that South African society would not tolerate those who were guilty of corruption.|$|E
6000|$|Dr. Duchenne {{has given}} a large {{photograph}} {{of an old man}} (reduced on Plate III. fig 4), in his usual passive condition, and another of the same man (fig. 5), naturally smiling. The latter was instantly recognized by every one to whom it was shown as true to nature. He has also given, as an example of an unnatural or false smile, another photograph (fig. 6) of the same old man, with {{the corners of his mouth}} strongly retracted by the galvanization of the great zygomatic muscles. That the expression is not natural is clear, for I showed this photograph to twenty-four persons, of whom three could not in the least tell what was meant, whilst the others, though they perceived that the expression was of the nature of a smile, answered in such words as [...] "a wicked joke," [...] "trying to laugh," [...] "grinning laughter ... .. half-amazed laughter," [...] &c. Dr. Duchenne attributes the falseness of the expression altogether to the orbicular muscles of the lower eyelids not being sufficiently contracted; for he justly lays great stress on their contraction in the expression of joy. No doubt there is much truth in this view, but not, as it appears to me, the whole truth. The contraction of the lower orbiculars is always accompanied, as we have seen, by the drawing up of the upper lip. Had the upper lip, in fig. 6, been thus acted on to a slight extent, its curvature would have been less rigid, the naso-labial farrow would have been slightly different, and the whole expression would, as I believe, have been more natural, independently of the more conspicuous effect from the stronger contraction of the lower eyelids. The <b>corruptor</b> muscle, moreover, in fig. 6, is too much contracted, causing a frown; and this muscle never acts under the influence of joy except during strongly pronounced or violent laughter.|$|E
