40|$|Hierarchical neural {{networks}} require the parallel extraction of multiple features. This {{raises the question}} how a subpopulation of cells can become specific to one feature and invariant to another, while a different subpopulation becomes invariant to the first but specific to the second feature. Using a colour image sequence recorded by a camera mounted to a caps head, we train a population of neurons to achieve optimally stable responses. We find that <b>colour</b> sensitive <b>cells</b> emerge. Adding the additional objective of decorrelating the neurons' outputs leads a subpopulation to develop achromatic receptive fields. The <b>colour</b> sensitive <b>cells</b> tend to be non-oriented, while the achromatic cells are orientation-tuned, in accordance with physiological findings. The proposed objective thus successfully separates cells which are specific for orientation and invariant to colour from orientation invariant <b>colour</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
50|$|V2, {{also called}} the prestriate cortex, is {{believed}} to have a small role in colour processing by projecting signals from V1 to the V4-complex. Whether or not <b>colour</b> selective <b>cells</b> are present in V2 is still being investigated. Some optical imaging studies have found small clusters of red-green <b>colour</b> selective <b>cells</b> in V1 and V2, but not any blue-yellow <b>colour</b> selective <b>cells.</b> Other studies have shown that V2 is activated by colour stimuli, but not colour after images.8 V4 also has feedback on V2, suggesting that there is a defined network of communication between the multiple areas of the visual cortex. When GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, was injected into V4 cells, V2 cells experienced a significant decrease in excitability.|$|R
40|$|In the 1950 s De Valois and colleagues, {{followed}} by other researchers, discovered spectrally opposed single {{cells in the}} primate LGN. They called them Red-Green and Yellow-Blue opponent <b>colour</b> <b>cells,</b> interpreting them as the biological implementation of Hering's opponent colours theory. By the 1990 s, it became increasingly clear the growing data on such cells did not match Hering's unique hues Red-Green, Yellow-Blue. Yet these cells today remain misleadingly described by opponent-colour or similar various terms, with no agreed best term. This paper reviews much of the data to show spectrally opposed responses in primate retina, LGN, and striate cortex are complementary colours of three types: Blue-Yellow, Red-Cyan, and (less often) Green-Magenta. Such cells may be termed 'complementary colour cells' as a generic category, and further specified by the respective hue pair, e. g. Red-Cyan.

30|$|However, the {{selection}} of the optimal colour palette is known to be an NP-complete problem [1]. In the image processing literature, many different algorithms have been introduced that aim to find a palette that allows for good image quality of the quantised image. A relatively simple approach is the popularity algorithm [2], which - typically following a uniform quantisation to 5 bits per channel - selects the N colours that are represented most often to form the colour palette. In median cut quantisation [2], an iterative procedure repeatedly splits (by a plane through the median point) <b>colour</b> <b>cells</b> into sub-cells. In octree quantisation [3], the colour space is represented as an octree where sub-branches are successively merged to form the palette, while Neuquant [4] employs a one-dimensional self-organising Kohonen neural network to generate the colour map.|$|R

40|$|The honeybee, Apis mellifera L., {{is one of}} {{the living}} creatures that has its colour vision proven through {{behavioural}} tests. Previous studies of honeybee colour vision has emphasized the relationship between the spectral sensitivities of photoreceptors and colour discrimination behaviour. The current understanding of the neural mechanisms of bee colour vision is, however, rather limited. The present study surveyed the patterns of chromatic information processing of visual neurons in the lobula of the honeybee, using intracellular recording stimulated by three light-emitting diodes, whose emission spectra approximately match the spectral sensitivity peaks of the honeybee. The recorded visual neurons can be divided into two groups: non-colour opponent <b>cells</b> and <b>colour</b> opponent <b>cells.</b> The non-colour opponent cells comprise six types of broad-band neurons and four response types of narrow-band neurons. The former might detect brightness of the environment or function as chromatic input channels, and the latter might supply specific chromatic input. Amongst the <b>colour</b> opponent <b>cells,</b> the principal neural mechanism of colour vision, eight response types were recorded. The receptive fields of these neurons were not centre surround as observed in primates. Some recorded neurons with tonic post-stimulus responses were observed, however, suggesting temporal defined spectral opponency may be part of the colour-coding mechanisms. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
