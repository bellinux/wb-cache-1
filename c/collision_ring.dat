40|$|We {{report the}} serendipitous {{discovery}} of a <b>collision</b> <b>ring</b> galaxy, identified as 2 MASX J 06470249 + 4554022, which we have dubbed 'Auriga's Wheel', found in a SUPRIME-CAM frame {{as part of a}} larger Milky Way survey. This peculiar class of galaxies is the result of a near head-on collision between typically, a late type and an early type galaxy. Subsequent GMOS-N long-slit spectroscopy has confirmed both the relative proximity of the components of this interacting pair and shown it to have a redshift of 0. 111. Analysis of the spectroscopy reveals that the late type galaxy is a LINER class Active Galactic Nuclei while the early type galaxy is also potentially an AGN candidate, this is very uncommon amongst known <b>collision</b> <b>ring</b> galaxies. Preliminary modeling of the ring finds an expansion velocity of ~ 200 kms^- 1 consistent with our observations, making the collision about 50 Myr old. The ring currently has a radius of about 10 kpc and a bridge of stars and gas is also visible connecting the two galaxies. Comment: 9 pages, 5 figures and 4 tables.

40|$|Velocity {{correlations}} are {{studied in}} granular fluids, modeled by the inelastic hard sphere gas. Making a density {{expansion of the}} Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon hierarchy {{for the evolution of}} the reduced distributions, we predict the presence of precollisional velocity correlations. They are created by the propagation through correlated sequences of <b>collisions</b> (<b>ring</b> events) of the velocity correlations generated after dissipative collisions. The correlations have their origin in the dissipative character of collisions, being always present in granular fluids. The correlations, that manifest microscopically as an alignment of the velocities of a colliding pair produce modifications of collisional averages, in particular, the virial pressure. The pressure shows a reduction with respect to the elastic case {{as a consequence of the}} velocity alignment. Good qualitative agreement is obtained for the comparison of the numerical evaluations of the obtained analytical expressions and molecular dynamics results that showed evidence of precollisional velocity correlations [R.

The solution of the homogeneous Fokker-Planck equation for nearly spherical spheroids is presented and investigated in general.

It {{has been one}} of the major challenges of experimental nuclear astrophysics to assess the magnitude of these cross sections in the laboratory. For a successful experiment high luminosity beams are needed. Increasing the target width, one also increases the reaction yields. But, this is of limited use due to multiple scattering in the target. Storage rings are a very good way to overcome these difficulties. In principle, they can be tuned to large luminosities, and have the advantage of crossing the interaction region many times per second (typically one million/s), compensating low density internal gas targets, or low reaction rates in beam-beam <b>collisions.</b> Storage <b>rings</b> are also ideal tools for precise measurements of masses and beta-decay lifetimes of nuclei of relevance for astrophysics.

40|$|The {{decay of}} the major ion species which {{constitute}} the ring current is studied by solving the time evolution of their distribution functions during the recovery phase of a moderate geomagnetic storm. In this work, only equatorially mirroring particles are considered. Particles are assumed to move subject to E x B and gradient drifts. They also experience loses along their drift paths. Two loss mechanisms are considered: charge exchange with neutral hydrogen atoms and Coulomb collisions with thermal plasma in the plasmasphere. Thermal plasma densities are calculated with a plasmaspheric model employing a time-dependent convection electric field model. The drift-loss model successfully reproduces {{a number of important}} and observable features in the distribution function. Charge exchange is found to be the major loss mechanism for the ring current ions; however the important effects of Coulomb collisions on both the ring current and thermal populations are also presented. The model predicts the formation of a low-energy (less than 500 eV) ion population as a result of energy degradation caused by Coulomb <b>collision</b> of the <b>ring</b> current ions with the plasmaspheric electrons; this population may be one source of the low-energy ions observed during active and quiet periods in the inner magnetosphere.

25|$|Impact {{velocities}} in {{the outer}} Solar System are typically ≈1km/s (compared with the escape velocity at the surface of Chariklo of ≈0.1km/s), and were even lower before the Kuiper belt was dynamically excited, supporting {{the possibility that the}} rings formed in the Kuiper belt before Chariklo was transferred to its current orbit less than 10 Myr ago. Impact velocities in the asteroid belt are much higher (≈5km/s), which could explain the absence of such ring features in minor bodies within the asteroid belt. <b>Collisions</b> between <b>ring</b> particles would cause the ring to widen substantially, and Poynting–Robertson drag would cause the ring particles to fall onto the central body within a few million years, requiring either an active source of ring particles or dynamical confinement by small (kilometre-sized) embedded or shepherd moons yet to be discovered.

Yet another types of phenomena are resonant gravitational influence of satellites, shepherding moons and also collective dynamics of ring particles which results in formation of spiral waves. Finally, there is a review of theories concerning the origin of Saturn's rings in Chapter 3.

At present, a tidal disruption of large differentiated moon seems to be the most probable theory...|$|R

The flows of gas and stars decouple from one another where stellar orbits cross, leaving regions of elevated gas density behind as the stars move freely past each other.
