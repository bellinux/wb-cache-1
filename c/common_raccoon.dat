500|$|Predators of {{the barn}} owl include large American opossums (Didelphis), the <b>common</b> <b>raccoon,</b> and similar {{carnivorous}} mammals, as well as eagles, larger hawks and other owls. Among the latter, the great horned owl (Bubo virginianus) in the Americas and the Eurasian eagle-owl (B. bubo) are noted predators of barn owls. Despite some sources claiming {{that there is little}} evidence of predation by great horned owls, one study from Washington found that 10.9% of the local great horned owl's diet was made up of barn owls. In Africa, the principle predators of barn owls are Verreaux's eagle-owls and cape eagle-owls. In Europe, although less dangerous than the eagle owl, the chief diurnal predators are the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) and the common buzzard (Buteo buteo). About a dozen other large diurnal raptors and owls have also been reported as predators of barn owls, ranging from the scarcely larger tawny owl to the golden eagle. The goshawk and the eagle owl are on the increase because of the greater protection these birds now receive.|$|E

5000|$|The crab-eating raccoon eats crab, lobster, {{and other}} crustaceans, but is an {{omnivore}} and its diet also includes, for example, small amphibians, turtle eggs, and fruits. It resembles its northern cousin, the <b>common</b> <b>raccoon,</b> {{in having a}} bushy ringed tail and [...] "bandit mask" [...] of fur around its eyes. Unlike the <b>common</b> <b>raccoon,</b> {{the hair on the}} nape of the neck points towards the head, rather than backward. The crab-eating raccoon also appears to be more adapted to an arboreal lifestyle than the <b>common</b> <b>raccoon,</b> with sharper, narrower claws. It also is better adapted for a diet of hard-shelled food, with most of the cheek teeth being larger than those of the <b>common</b> <b>raccoon,</b> with broader, rounded cusps. Although the crab-eating raccoon can appear smaller and more streamlined than the <b>common</b> <b>raccoon</b> due to its much shorter fur and more gracile build, the crab-eating raccoon is of similar dimensions to the northern species. Head and body length is 41 to 80 cm, tail length is 20 to 56 cm and height at the shoulder is about 23 cm. Weights can range from 2 to 12 kg, though are mostly between 5 and 7 kg. Males are usually larger than the females.|$|E
25|$|Black-footed ferrets are {{susceptible}} to numerous diseases. They are fatally susceptible to canine distemper virus, introduced by striped skunks, <b>common</b> <b>raccoons,</b> red foxes, coyotes, and American badgers. A short-term vaccine for canine distemper is available for captive black-footed ferrets, but no protection is available for young born in the wild. Black-footed ferrets are also susceptible to rabies, tularemia, and human influenza. They can directly contract sylvatic plague (Yersinia pestis), and epidemics in prairie dog towns may completely destroy the ferrets' prey base.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{method that}} could help to restore the populations is captive {{breeding}} techniques. [...] If they willingly reproduce in captivity as the <b>common</b> <b>raccoons</b> do, {{it could be used}} successfully. Additionally, the arrival of pets, especially feral cats, brought more diseases and parasites that are having a significant effect on the raccoons. The best method of reducing these impacts is to remove as many feral cats as possible. For any conservation action to be successful, conservation personnel will {{need to find a way}} to compromise with the tourism industry to save the Cozumel raccoons.|$|R
50|$|Species foundMuch of {{the swamp}} habitat is water. Of the smaller animals, meadow voles were found and so were white-footed mice.

Mumford {{in the fall of}} 1978 the swamp areas were found to be {{populated}} by masked shrews, white-footed mice, and northern short-tailed shrews. Based on the two surveys done in the swamps, the researchers suspect that the shrew population has been dropping between 1978 and 1994.|$|R

50|$|Deforestation {{leads to}} {{fragmented}} forest habitats and nest predators {{tend to be}} more abundant in these fragmented landscapes. If the fragmented area is long and narrow, it will have greater predation rates because it can easily be reached by nest predators from other areas.

50|$|In {{its initial}} {{description}} in 1898, the Tres Marias raccoon {{was classified as}} a subspecies of the <b>common</b> <b>raccoon</b> (Procyon lotor) by Clinton Hart Merriam.

It is therefore assumed that the Tres Marias raccoon was introduced to the Islas Marías not long ago.

50|$|Baylisascaris procyonis, <b>common</b> name <b>raccoon</b> {{roundworm}}, is a roundworm nematode, found ubiquitously in raccoons, {{the definitive}} hosts. It {{is named after}} H. A. Baylis, who studied them in the 1920s-30s, and Greek askaris (intestinal worm). Baylisascaris larvae in paratenic hosts can migrate, causing visceral larva migrans (VLM). Baylisascariasis as the zoonotic infection of humans is rare, though extremely dangerous due {{to the ability of}} the parasite's larvae to migrate into brain tissue and cause damage. Concern for human infection has been increasing over the years due to urbanization of rural areas resulting in the increase in proximity and potential human interaction with raccoons.|$|R
