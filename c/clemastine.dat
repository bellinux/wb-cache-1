We investigated the possibility that higher concentrations of these drugs, administered directly to the bronchial tree, might produce bronchodilatation. Twelve asthmatic patients inhaled aerosols generated from solutions of <b>clemastine</b> (0 05 % 0), salbutamol (0 5 %), and placebo. Bronchodilatation was assessed by changes in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEVY) and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) over four hours.

We have extended these studies to determine the site of action of inhaled <b>clemastine</b> and to assess its potential usefulness both as a bronchodilator and as a maintenance treatment. Eleven stable asthmatic patients received inhaled <b>clemastine</b> and placebo and the effect was assessed by serial maximum expiratory flow volume (MEFV) curves breathing air and a helium/oxygen (He/O 2) mixture.

40|$|P 2 X 7 receptors {{have emerged}} as {{potential}} drug targets {{for the treatment of}} medical conditions such as e. g. rheumatoid arthritis and neuropathic pain. To assess the impact of pharmaceuticals on P 2 X 7, we screened a compound library comprising approved or clinically tested drugs and identified several compounds that augment the ATP-triggered P 2 X 7 activity in a stably transfected HEK 293 cell line. Of these, <b>clemastine</b> markedly sensitized Ca 2 + entry through P 2 X 7 to lower ATP concentrations. Extracellularly but not intracellularly applied <b>clemastine</b> rapidly and reversibly augmented P 2 X 7 -mediated whole-cell currents evoked by non-saturating ATP concentrations. <b>Clemastine</b> also accelerated the ATP-induced pore formation and Yo-Pro- 1 uptake, increased the fractional NMDG+ permeability, and stabilized the open channel conformation of P 2 X 7. Thus, <b>clemastine</b> is an extracellularly binding allosteric modulator of P 2 X 7 that sensitizes P 2 X 7 to lower ATP concentrations and facilitates its pore dilation. The activity of <b>clemastine</b> on native P 2 X 7 receptors, Ca 2 + entry, and whole-cell currents was confirmed in human monocyte-derived macrophages. Similar effects were observed in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages. Consistent with the data on recombinant P 2 X 7, <b>clemastine</b> augmented the ATP-induced cation entry and Yo-Pro- 1 uptake. In accordance with the observation that P 2 X 7 controls the cytokine release from LPS-primed macrophages, we found that <b>clemastine</b> augmented the IL- 1 β release from LPS-primed human macrophages. Collectively, these data point to a sensitization of the recombinantly or natively expressed human P 2 X 7 receptor toward its physiological activator, ATP, possibly leading to a modulation of macrophage-dependent immune responses...|$|E

40|$|An H 1 -receptor {{blocking}} antihistamine, <b>clemastine,</b> {{taken before}} aspirin gave complete or partial protection against flushing, rhinorrhea, cough, and headache in ten asthmatic patients with idiosyncrasy to aspirin.

The two antihistamines <b>clemastine</b> and desloratadine, currently used for symptom alleviation in allergy, induced potent reduction of the activities of the constitutively active transcription factors c-Myc, STAT 3, STAT 5 a and STAT 5 b in mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome cell lines.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Histamine {{released}} from activated mast cells and basophils {{is an important}} mediator in allergy. Therefore, antihistamines are efficiently and widely used to suppress allergic symptoms. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the role of antihistamines in sensitization against allergens and in the efficiency of allergen-specific immunotherapy. METHODS: CBA mice were sensitized and de-sensitized with bee venom allergen extracts and the major allergen phospholipase A 2. <b>Clemastine</b> {{was used to test}} the effect of a histamine- 1 receptor antagonist on the immune responses to phospholipase A 2. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that sensitization against bee venom was strongly enhanced during treatment with antihistamines. <b>Clemastine</b> increased IgE production while decreasing IgG 2 a production against bee venom. This T-helper type 2 shift of the humoral response appeared to be caused by reduced IFN-gamma and enhanced IL- 4 secretion from allergen-specific T cells. We also found reduced TNF-alpha, IL- 6 and major histocompatibility complex class-II expression by macrophages. In sensitized mice, the efficiency of allergen-specific immunotherapy was reduced by <b>clemastine</b> treatment. CONCLUSION: Antihistamines may enhance allergic sensitization and reduce the efficiency of allergen-specific immunotherapy. Future studies will need to demonstrate to what extent pre-medication with antihistamine also affects allergen-specific immunotherapy in humans...|$|E
