40|$|FLUSEPA (Registered {{trademark}} in France No. 134009261) is {{an advanced}} simulation tool which performs a large panel of aerodynamic studies. It is the unstructured finite-volume solver developed by Airbus Safran Launchers company to calculate compressible, multidimensional, unsteady, viscous and reactive flows around bodies in relative motion. The time integration in FLUSEPA is done using an explicit temporal adaptive method. The current production {{version of the}} code is based on MPI and OpenMP. This implementation leads to important synchronizations that must be reduced. To tackle this problem, we present the study of a task-based parallelization of the aerodynamic solver of FLUSEPA using the runtime system StarPU and combining up to three levels of parallelism. We validate our solution by the simulation (using a finite-volume mesh with 80 million cells) of a take-off blast wave propagation for Ariane 5 launcher.

Different methods of classification based on sparse representation and Gabor kernels have been widely applied {{in the fields of}} facial analysis. However, most of these methods treat face from a whole view standpoint. In terms of the importance of different facial views, in this paper, we present multi-view face analysis based on sparse representation and Gabor wavelet coefficients. To evaluate the performance, we conduct face analysis experiments including face recognition (FR) and face expression recognition (FER) on JAFFE database. Experiments are conducted from two parts: (1) Face images are divided into three facial parts which are forehead, eye and mouth. (2) Face images are divided into 8 parts by the orientation of Gabor kernels. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods can significantly boost the performance and perform better than the other methods.

This model and its relevant extensions play important roles in Operations Research for finding the optimal solutions for several planning problems in Business and Industry. Several methods have been developed to solve these models, the most known is Vogels Approximation Method (VAM). A modified version of VAM is proposed to obtain near optimal solutions or the optimum in some defined cases. Modified Vogel Method (MVM) consists iteratively in constructing a reduced cost matrix before applying VAM. Beside to MVM, another approach has been developed, namely the Zero Case Penalty, which represents different penalty computational aspects. Through the research, the results of methods-comparison studies and comparative analysis are presented. Furthermore, special classes, the Unbalanced TP and the Transshipment models, were studied and solved with different approaches.

In this regard, as retail investors are prone {{to be influenced by}} news or other social media, psychological and behavioral features extracted from social media platforms are thought to well predict stock price movements in the China's market. Recent advances in the investor social network in China enables the extraction of such features from web-scale data.

Owing to the kinetic nature of the LBM, the procedure we propose ensures to accurately couple DSMC and LBM at a larger Kn number than usually done in traditional hybrid DSMC-Navier-Stokes equation models. We show the main steps of the mapping algorithm and illustrate details of the implementation. Good agreement is found between the moments of the single particle distribution function as obtained from the mapping scheme and from independent LBM or DSMC simulations at the grid nodes where the coupling is imposed. We also show results on the application of the hybrid scheme based on a simpler mapping scheme for plane Poiseuille flow at finite Kn number. Potential gains in the computational efficiency assured by the application of the coupling scheme are estimated for the same flow.

A central scientific challenge is the description and explanation of network dynamics, {{with a key}} test being the prediction of {{short and long term}} changes. For the problem of short-term link prediction, existing methods attempt to determine neighborhood metrics that correlate with the appearance of a link in the next observation period. Recent work has suggested that the incorporation of topological features and node attributes can improve link prediction. We provide an approach to predicting future links by applying the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) to optimize weights which are used in a linear combination of sixteen neighborhood and node similarity indices. We examine a large dynamic social network with over $ 10 ^ 6 $ nodes (Twitter reciprocal reply networks), both as a test of our general method and as a problem of scientific interest in itself. Our method exhibits fast convergence and high levels of precision for the top twenty predicted links.

40|$|Damage {{nucleation}} from repeated dislocation absorption at a {{grain boundary}} is simulated with molecular dynamics. At the grain boundary-dislocation intersection site, atomic shuffling events {{determine how the}} free volume brought by the incoming dislocation is accommodated. This process in turn determines the crack nucleation mechanism, {{as well as the}} critical strain and number of dislocations that can be absorbed before cracking. Slower strain rates promote earlier crack nucleation and a damage nucleation mode where cracking is preceded by dislocation emission. The simulation methodology presented here can be used to probe other types of boundaries as well, although multiple thermodynamically equivalent starting configurations are required to quantify the damage resistance of a given grain boundary.

40|$|Mathematical {{model that}} allows for direct {{tracking}} of the homoepitaxial crystal growth {{out of the window}} etched in the solid, pre-deposited layer on the substrate is described. The growth is governed by the normal (to the crystal-vapor interface) flux from the vapor phase and by the interface diffusion. The model accounts for possibly inhomogeneous energy of the mask surface and for strong anisotropies of crystal-vapor interfacial energy and kinetic mobility. Results demonstrate that the motion of the crystal-mask contact line slows down abruptly as radius of curvature of the mask edge approaches zero. Numerical procedure is suggested to overcome difficulties associated with ill-posedness of the evolution problem for the interface with strong energy anisotropy.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{study on the}} evolution of Stoner factor with doping concentration for various doped 122 systems (like BaFe$_ 2 $As$_ 2 $, SrFe$_ 2 $As$_ 2 $) of Fe-based superconductors is presented. Our first principles electronic structure calculations reveal that for Co/Ru (electron or iso-electronic) doping at Fe sites or P doping at As sites result in a reduction of Stoner factor with increasing doping concentration. On the contrary, in case of Na/K (hole) doping at the Ba sites, Stoner factor is enhanced for higher doping concentrations. This may be considered as an indicator of elevation of "magnetic fluctuation" in these systems. We find that the Stoner factor uniquely follows the variation of the pnictide height z$_{As}$/Fe-As bond length with various kinds of doping. Our calculated Fermi surfaces explicate the diversities in the behaviour of Stoner factors for various doped 122 systems; larger degree of Fermi surface nesting, larger the value of Stoner factor and vice versa.

Both vertically placed (embedded) inclusions and horizontally placed (surface) inclusions are considered. The energetics of the membrane, as a two-dimensional (2 D) meso-scale continuum sheet, is described by the Canham-Helfrich Hamiltonian, with the membrane height function treated as a stochastic process. The diffusion parameter of this process acts as the link coupling the membrane shape fluctuations to the kinematics of the inclusions. The latter is described via Ito stochastic differential equation. In addition to stochastic forces, the inclusions also experience membrane-induced deterministic forces. Our aim is to simulate the diffusion-driven aggregation of inclusions and show how the external inclusions arrive at the sites of the embedded inclusions. The model has potential use in such emerging fields as designing a targeted drug delivery system. Comment: 19 pages plus 5 figures. To appear in <b>Computational</b> Materials <b>Scienc...</b>|$|R

All the elastic constants and moduli increase when carbon is replaced by nitrogen. The elastic anisotropy in Ti 2 CdC is higher in comparison with that of Ti 2 CdN. Both these nanolaminates are brittle in nature. The calculated electronic band structures and density of states suggest that the chemical bonding in these two ternary compounds is a combination of covalent, ionic and metallic in nature. Electrical conductivity of Ti 2 CdC is found to be higher than that of Ti 2 CdN.

40|$|We suggest and {{implement}} a parallelization scheme based on an efficient multiband eigenvalue solver, called the locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient LOBPCG method, and using an optimized three-dimensional (3 D) fast Fourier transform (FFT) in the ab initio}plane-wave code ABINIT. In addition to the standard data partitioning over processors corresponding to different k-points, we introduce data partitioning with respect to blocks of bands as well as spatial partitioning in the Fourier space of coefficients over the plane waves basis set used in ABINIT. This k-points-multiband-FFT parallelization avoids any collective communications on the whole set of processors relying instead on one-dimensional communications only. For a single k-point, super-linear scaling is achieved for up to 100 processors due to an extensive use of hardware optimized BLAS, LAPACK, and SCALAPACK routines, mainly in the LOBPCG routine. We observe good performance up to 200 processors. With 10 k-points our three-way data partitioning results in linear scaling up to 1000 processors for a practical system used for testing.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{including}} the Hubbard on-site Coulombic correction to the structural parameters and valence energy states of wurtzite ZnO was explored. Due {{to the changes}} in the structural parameters caused by correction of hybridization between Zn d states and O p states, suitable parameters of Hubbard terms have to be determined for an accurate prediction of ZnO properties. Using the LDA+${U}$ method by applying Hubbard corrections $U_p$ to Zn 3 d states and $U_p$ to O 2 p states, the lattice constants were underestimated for all tested Hubbard parameters. The combination of both $U_d$ and $U_p$ correction terms managed to widen the band gap of wurtzite ZnO to the experimental value. Pairs of $U_p$ and $U_p$ parameters with the correct positioning of d-band and accurate bandwidths were selected, in addition to predicting an accurate band gap value. Inspection of vibrational properties, however, revealed mismatches between the estimated gamma phonon frequencies and experimental values. The selection of Hubbard terms based on electronic band properties alone cannot ensure an accurate vibrational description in LDA+${U}$ calculation.

40|$|Direct {{prediction}} of material properties from microstructures through statistical models has {{shown to be}} a potential approach to accelerating computational material design with large design spaces. However, statistical modeling of highly nonlinear mappings defined on high-dimensional microstructure spaces is known to be data-demanding. Thus, the added value of such predictive models diminishes in common cases where material samples (in forms of 2 D or 3 D microstructures) become costly to acquire either experimentally or computationally. To this end, we propose a generative machine learning model that creates an arbitrary amount of artificial material samples with negligible computation cost, when trained on only a limited amount of authentic samples. The key contribution of this work is the introduction of a morphology constraint to the training of the generative model, that enforces the resultant artificial material samples to have the same morphology distribution as the authentic ones. We show empirically that the proposed model creates artificial samples that better match with the authentic ones in material property distributions than those generated from a state-of-the-art Markov Random Field model, and thus is more effective at improving the prediction performance of a predictive structure-property model.

40|$|For {{the first}} time, we have {{reported}} in this study an ab initio investigation on elastic properties, Debye temperature, Mulliken population, Vickers hardness, and charge density of superconducting ScRhP and ScIrP phosphides. The optimized cell parameters show fair agreement with experimental results. The elastic constants and moduli, Poisson's as well as Pugh's ratio and elastic anisotropy factors have also been calculated to understand the mechanical behavior of these ternary compounds. Their mechanical stability is confirmed via the calculated elastic constants. The calculated values for Poisson's and Pugh's ratio indicate the ductile nature of these compounds. ScIrP {{is expected to be}} elastically more anisotropic than ScRhP. The estimated value of Debye temperature predicts that ScRhP is thermally more conductive than ScIrP and the phonon frequency in ScRhP is higher than that in ScIrP. The hardness of ScRhP is lower due to the presence of anti-bonding Rh-Rh in ScRhP. The investigated electronic structure predict that the metallic conductivity of ScRhP reduces significantly when Rh is replaced with Ir. The main contribution to the total density of states (TDOS) at Fermi-level (EF) comes from the d-electrons of Sc and Rh/Ir in both compounds. These two ternary compounds are characterized mainly by metallic and covalent bonding with little ionic contribution. As far as superconductivity is concerned, the matrix elements of electron-phonon interaction are noticeably enhanced in ScIrP compared to that in ScRhP.

40|$|The {{theory of}} phase {{stability}} in the Ni-Au alloy system is a popular topic due to the large size mismatch between Ni and Au, which makes the effects of atomic relaxation critical, and {{also the fact that}} Ni-Au exhibits a phase separation tendency at low temperatures, but measurements at high-temperature show an ordering-type short-range order. We have clarified the wide disparity which exists in the previously calculated values of mixing energies and thermodynamic properties by computing "state-of-the-art" energetics (full-potential, fully-relaxed LDA total energies) combined with "state-of-the-art" statistics (k-space cluster expansion with Monte Carlo simulations) for the Ni-Au system. We find: (i) LDA provides accurate mixing energies of disordered Ni_ 1 -xAu_x alloys (Δ H_mix < + 100 meV/atom) provided that both atomic relaxation (a 100 meV/atom effect) and short-range order (25 meV/atom) are taken into account properly. (ii) Previous studies using empirical potentials or approximated LDA methods often underestimate the formation energy of ordered compounds, and hence also underestimate the mixing energy of random alloys. (iii) Measured values of the total entropy of mixing combined with calculated values of the configurational entropy demonstrate that the non-configurational entropy in Ni-Au is large, and leads to a significant reduction in miscibillity gap temperature. (iv) The calculated short-range order agrees well with measurements, and both predict ordering in the disordered phase. (v) Consequently, using inverse Monte Carlo to extract interaction energies from the measured/calculated short-range order in Ni-Au would result in interactions which would produce ordering-type mixing energies, in contradiction with both experimental measurements and precise LDA energies.

Simulations are repeated at high temperatures. We fix the lower limit of breaking strains to short SWCNTs without bond breaking or 5 - 7 defects formation. At room temperature, the simulated (4, 4) SWCNT is able to carry the strain up to 130 % of the relaxed tube length without bond breaking or 5 - 7 defects formation. This value is 127 % for (11, 0) SWCNT, 125 % for (17, 0) SWCNT, 123 % for (10, 10) SWCNT. In defect free, short nanotubes as the nanotube's radius increase the bond-breakings occur at lower strain values regardless of their chirality. This is true when we heat the tubes to higher temperatures. Bond breaking strain values, tensile strength, Young's modulus of the SWCNTs are obtained as functions of temperature. Defect free zigzag nanotubes exhibit higher tensile strength than armchaired ones. Young's modulus of defect free individual singlewall nanotubes {{is found to be}} in the range of 0. 400 TPa within the elastic limit. At room temperature and experimentally realizable strain values, thinner tubes are more resistant to bond breaking and zigzag tubes over armchair ones. At high temperatures although the resistance to strain drops the same trend still holds. We observe a slight decrease of the tensile strength with increasing temperatures. The same trend is also observed in the Young's modulus. Results are important in determining a true breaking strains of SWCNTs. Comment: 25 pages, 1 table, 7 figures.

The single crystal elastic constants Cij and other polycrystalline elastic coefficients have been calculated and the mechanical stabilities of these compounds have been theoretically confirmed. The bulk modulus increases and the shear modulus decreases due to partial Bi/Sn/Sb substitution for Al in Zr 2 AlC. The calculated elastic moduli show that these Bi/Sn/Sb containing MAX phases are more anisotropic than Zr 2 AlC, and have a tendency towards ductility. The Vickers hardness decreases in the Bi/Sn/Sb containing compounds. Further, the electronic band structures {{and electronic}} density of states (EDOS) are calculated and the effects of different elemental substitution on these properties are investigated. The electronic band structures show metallic characteristics with contribution predominantly coming from the Zr 4 d orbitals. Partial presence of Bi/Sn/Sb atoms increases the EDOS at the Fermi level to some extent.
