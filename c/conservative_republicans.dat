5|$|Eric Foner (2010) {{contrasts}} the abolitionists and anti-slavery Radical Republicans of the Northeast who saw slavery as a sin, {{with the}} <b>conservative</b> <b>Republicans</b> {{who thought it}} was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress. Foner argues that Lincoln was a moderate in the middle, opposing slavery primarily because it violated the republicanism principles of the Founding Fathers, especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the Declaration of Independence.|$|E
5|$|Mathias {{was elected}} to the Senate in 1968, {{unseating}} the incumbent Democrat, Daniel Brewster, who twenty years earlier had been his roommate while attending the University of Maryland School of Law. He continued his record as a liberal Republican in the Senate, and frequently clashed with the conservative wing of his party. For a few months in late 1975 and early 1976, Mathias considered running an insurgent presidential campaign in an attempt to stave off the increasing influence of <b>conservative</b> <b>Republicans</b> led by Ronald Reagan.|$|E

5|$|On August 20, Ford {{nominated}} former New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller to {{fill the}} vice presidency he had vacated. Rockefeller's top competitor had been George H. W. Bush. Rockefeller underwent extended hearings before Congress, which caused embarrassment when it was revealed he made large gifts to senior aides, such as Henry Kissinger. Although <b>conservative</b> <b>Republicans</b> were not pleased that Rockefeller was picked, most of them voted for his confirmation, and his nomination passed both the House and Senate. Some, including Barry Goldwater, voted against him.|$|E
5|$|Interested {{parties on}} both sides filed amici. A group of <b>conservative</b> <b>Republicans</b> {{in both houses of}} Congress, {{including}} Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey, Henry Hyde and Rick Santorum, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children both argued for affirming the conviction, pointing to the invaluable nature of undercover investigations in fighting child pornography, worrying that requiring reasonable suspicion beforehand could make such operations impossible. Americans for Effective Law Enforcement said there had been no entrapment and that reasonable suspicion was not required before starting investigations such as Looking Glass. The American Civil Liberties Union, its Nebraska chapter and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers weighed in on Jacobson's behalf.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Democrats' {{advantage}} in the Senate, conservative Democrats united with the Republican minority to oppose much of Truman's agenda, most notably, civil rights legislation. In March 1949, Democratic floor leader Scott W. Lucas introduced an amendment to Senate Rule XXII to make cloture easier to achieve; hoping to end a ten-day filibuster against a civil rights bill. <b>Conservative</b> <b>Republicans</b> and Southern Democrats opposed the rule change and tried to obstruct it. Lucas asked for a cloture vote on the rule change, but opponents contended that the motion was out of order. Barkley studied the original debate on Rule XXII, which governed both cloture motions, before ruling in Lucas' favor. Georgia Senator Richard Russell, Jr. appealed Barkley's decision, and the chamber voted 46–41 to overrule. Sixteen Republicans, mostly from Northeast and West Coast states, voted to sustain the ruling; most Southern Democrats voted with the remaining Republicans to overrule it.|$|E

Communism finally collapsed in the Soviet Union in 1991.|$|E

25|$|Until the Affordable Healthcare for America Act, a {{combination}} of factors kept health care {{off the top of the}} agenda. For example, politicians were not eager to confront the forces that successfully frustrated the Clinton effort, health maintenance organizations were able to limit cost increases to some extent, and a <b>conservative</b> <b>Republican</b> majority in Congress or a <b>conservative</b> <b>Republican</b> president was in power or in office.|$|R

25|$|The {{conservative}} {{economic and}} fiscal policies of Herbert Hoover are often popularly {{contrasted with the}} New Deal deficit spending of Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Republican Party opposition to Roosevelt's government spending was a unifying cause for a significant caucus of Republicans through even the presidencies of Truman and Eisenhower. Barry Goldwater was a famous champion of both the socially and fiscally <b>conservative</b> <b>Republicans.</b>|$|E
