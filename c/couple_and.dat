40|$|Chidamber and Kemerer {{suite of}} metrics {{were used in}} the study of 3250 classes from five JAVA based {{industrial}} systems. System 1 had 34 classes, System 2 had 318 classes, System 3 383 classes, System 4 1055 classes, and System 5 1460 classes. Metric values were computed for the Lack of Cohesion in Methods (LCOM), Coupling between Object Classes (CBO), Response For a Class (RFC), Number of Children (NOC), Depth of Inheritance (DIT), Weighted Methods per Class (WMC), Number of Public Methods (NPM) <b>and</b> Afferent <b>Coupling</b> (CA). LCOM was used as cohesion variable; CBO, RFC, CA as coupling variables; WMC, NPM, NOC as size variables and DIT as inheritance variable. Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis were used to analyze the results. Tests of hypotheses were carried out to examine if there were significant relationships between cohesion and couplingvariables, cohesion and size variables, cohesion <b>and</b> inheritance variables, <b>coupling</b> <b>and</b> inheritance variables, <b>coupling</b> <b>and</b> size variables, inheritance and size variables. The results of the study showed that in System 1, there were strong significant relationships between cohesion <b>and</b> <b>coupling</b> (CBO, RFC), cohesion <b>and</b> size (WMC,NPM), <b>coupling</b> <b>and</b> size variables (WMC, NPM), and a weak relationship between Affarent <b>coupling</b> CA <b>and</b> inheritance (DIT). In System 2, there were strong significant relationship between cohesion <b>and</b> <b>coupling</b> (CBO, RFC), cohesion and size variables (WMC, NPM), <b>coupling</b> <b>and</b> size (WMC, NPM); a low relationship between <b>coupling</b> by CA <b>and</b> WMC, NOC, and a weak relationship between inheritance DIT and WMC, RFC, NPM. In System 3, there were strong significant relationship between cohesion <b>and</b> <b>coupling</b> (CBO, RFC), cohesion and size (WMC, NPM), <b>coupling</b> <b>and</b> size (WMC, NPM); a low relationship between coupling by CA.

In {{the first decade of}} the 21st century, key concepts of attachment were incorporated into existing models of behavioural couple therapy, multidimensional family therapy and <b>couple</b> <b>and</b> family therapy. Specifically attachment-centred interventions have been developed, such as attachment-based family therapy and emotionally focused therapy.|$|E

On 17 August 1887, a homeless man named James Taylor stole a jacket and pair of leather gloves from Pickingill. Taylor was arrested and brought to trial in Rochford on 24 August; in October, he pleaded guilty to the theft of the jacket, although not to those of the other items.
