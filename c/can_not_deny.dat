5000|$|People {{often think}} that the central bank had magical powers. No matter how the {{financial}} crisis occurs, I think the central bank lowered the interest rate financial market will return to normal. This {{is thought to be}} exaggerated, but the image of the central market than it actually is. When the financial crisis occurred in the past, the present time response of the central bank measures that have worked can not exert more force. Now, aggressive central banks have been more difficult to rely on monetary policy. While the huge capital using the leverage is not a limit. The most recent case revealed the limitations of the central bank was {{in the early years of}} the US sub-prime mortgage crisis occurred the first time 2008. At the time the Federal Reserve central bank was faced with rising inflation and house prices collapse, banks lending crisis, the risk to the US economy fall into the weak dollar. Policy makers in the US are afraid there is no obvious solution to the risk of disappointing some policies were also aware of the fact that there can only lead to negative results. Also, look the United States who the US central bank is hardly a worldwide central bank had presided over the financial world of the dollar oriented, the sub-prime mortgage crisis has complete control of interest rate policy in the global financial system like anymore, while generating as globalization begins also it showed. [...] But the more serious problem is that the huge financial crisis, when there happen next, and no one is not sure whether the central bank will be and how many days to solve the financial crisis. Subprime mortgage crisis is nothing more than a side issue compared to the interruption of trade war with China and Asian capital flows caused by the aftermath. [...] The reality is that the global trade and financial capital to move freely in the siege being in the world <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>deny</b> anyone. And Democrats and Republicans in the US has been gradually move away from policies that constitute a tremendously explosive prosperity. The same is true in Europe and other countries. The market started to notice it, and it also noted the central bank troubled people. I am aware of the fact that a series of policy mistakes that caused the loss of long-term costs can be a huge disaster better than anyone. This was creating huge wealth and reduce poverty system in danger. This system has revolutionized the world to produce the goods in the global market in charitable donations. However, central banks, while solving the debt as a result of the subprime mortgage crisis was much more accurate understanding of the system. And the central bank began keeping the place they convince a new global monetary policy for the 21st century. The US Federal Reserve also avoiding that which severely damaged the US financial sector very carefully so that you can restore the world's confidence in the global financial markets, it is necessary to desperately try to restructure.|$|E
