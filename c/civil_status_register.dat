40|$|The {{topic of}} this paper is {{problematic}} {{due to the lack of}} shared understanding of its terms (refugees, migrants, law and Palestine). Research of such a topic, therefore, must be delimited as to prevent misunderstanding, misanalysis and misjudgement. The definition of one of these terms shall delimit and define the content of the others. Unless specified differently, in this paper “Palestine” refers to the territories known as the Occupied Palestinian Territories (oPt), covering what was called before 1967 as the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) 1 and the Gaza Strip (for many Palestinians, this definition forms the territorial basis of a future Palestinian homeland). While the term “law” will refer to all legal norms enforced within Palestine, meaning all Palestinian Authority (PA) legislations, previously endorsed (Jordanian, Egyptian) laws and finally Israeli occupation “laws” as Israel is in complete control of borders, <b>civil</b> <b>status</b> <b>register,</b> issuing visas, permits of stay and the like.

40|$|International audienceThe {{reforms of}} the hat, weights and measures, calendar, the {{alphabet}} or of the surnames {{are part of a}} revolution of the signifiers orchestrated by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. The surname reform was intended to impose to every Turkish citizen the obligation to bear a surname, in order to better authenticate people. However, this gain of authentication by the State was relative {{because of the number of}} homonyms. This article is based on the analysis of a <b>civil</b> <b>status</b> <b>register</b> of an Anatolian village, and seeks to answer this question : « Why so many homonyms ? ». It argues that homonymy supports the making of the family both symbolically and really. The 1934 Kemalist first stumbled on this particular method of making the family which emphasizes the « same » over the « different ». Les réformes du chapeau, des poids et des mesures, du calendrier, de l’alphabet ou des noms de famille participent d’une révolution des signifiants orchestrée par Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. L’une d’entre elles avait pour objectif d’imposer l’obligation du port d’un nom de famille aux citoyens de Turquie, ceci pour mieux authentifier les personnes. Or ce gain d’authentification par l’État fut très relatif dans un premier temps en raison du nombre d’homonymies. Partant de l’analyse d’un registre d’état civil d’un village anatolien, cet article cherche à répondre à cette question : « pourquoi tant d’homonymes ? ». L’argument principal défendu ici est que l’homonymie soutient la fabrication de la famille tant dans un registre symbolique que réel. C’est sur cette modalité particulière de fabrication de la famille qui privilégie le « même » par rapport au « différent » qu’a buté dans un premier temps la réforme kémaliste de 1934...|$|E

The pieces of archive are stored for long-term conservation in specially equipped stacks that comply with the highest standards for temperature, air humidity, fire and flooding safety. The documents are stored in folders and acid-free archive boxes foreseen with all necessary identification elements. Archives producers can purchase these acid-free archive boxes from the State Archives at a reasonable price. Archives deteriorated by the ravages of time are restored and rebound. Documents frequently consulted by the public (parish <b>registers,</b> <b>civil</b> <b>status</b> <b>registers,</b> maps, plans and drawings, old charters on parchment) are microfilmed and increasingly often digitized {{in order to avoid}} damages to the originals.The State Archives coordinates the archival policy at national level and fosters efficient international cooperation.|$|R

There, students, genealogists, historians, researchers, etc. can consult numerous archive documents in paper, microfilm or in digital format. Various publications to help with research (inventories, guides, etc.) {{are available in the}} reading rooms or can be purchased from the shop of the National Archives.Another priority of the State Archives is to make a maximum of information accessible via the Internet. A number of publications can be downloaded free of charge from the website of the institution. These concern, for instance, the church <b>registers,</b> many <b>civil</b> <b>status</b> <b>registers</b> older than 100 years, the proceedings of the Council of Ministers meetings from 1917 to 1979, etc.In order to make their vast collections known to the public, the State Archives regularly organizes thematic exhibitions in its different repositories, presenting archive documents in their wider social and cultural context. On the occasion of these events, a related catalogue, scientific dossier or brochure is published. Colloquia, symposia, conferences, seminars are organized for particular audiences. The State Archives also takes part in various other events (for instance: Open Monument Day) announced on the website of the institution, its Facebook page or via its Newsletter.|$|R

40|$|The parish <b>registers</b> of <b>civil</b> <b>status,</b> {{although}} the {{main sources of}} documentation for historical demography, are used with significant results by the other sciences such as history, ethnography, sociology, anthropology, linguistics, etc [...] The perspectives of approaching the rural community and family have expanded considerably using these sources of ecclesiastical origin documentaries. The first researchers who refer to a systematic methodology that uses the parish <b>registers</b> of <b>civil</b> <b>status</b> as documentary sources for the completion of demographic data suggest the use of other sources, hitherto unused for this purpose. They will apply a new method, a modern innovation, the stripping and analysis of parish <b>registers</b> of <b>civil</b> <b>status</b> {{within the meaning of}} the reconstruction of demographic events (birth, marriage, death). The family reconstitution method, by analyzing the parish <b>registers</b> of <b>civil</b> <b>status</b> proposed by L. Henry and M. Fleury, has revolutionized the field of study dealing with people. Louis Henry believes that the parish <b>registers</b> of <b>civil</b> <b>status</b> is the ultimate source of information for the pre-state period and this is precisely the reason for which he proposes restoring the family’s biological life. Church registers are only able to give us an insight into the family in rural areas, at least for {{the second half of the}} XIX century. Church documents, the fundamental sources for researching family life, are of two categories: 1. <b>civil</b> <b>status</b> <b>registers</b> and annual reports of the parishes, 2. Church authorities funds, documents and minutes recorded by the bishops. These documents are complex sources for the researcher interested in historical demography, social history, and the economic history of toponymy, birthdays, etc. Processing the data contained in these records requires a specific methodology. They allow us to observe trends that have occurred on the long-term demographic events such as: birth, marriage or death. These records are presented for a long time as their only source of documentation regarding <b>civil</b> <b>status</b> and demographic events in the life of most people. Researching these records can unveil important features of natural population movement, the phenomenon of birth, of marriage, the divorce or death. Then, an analysis of form and content of these registers can capture the cultural universe of the priests who fill these records. These Church documents proved to be important, especially where other documentary sources (mainly those in the category of records made by the state) have proved insufficient, incomplete and unclear. The parish <b>registers</b> of <b>civil</b> <b>status</b> in this case are suitable for both a qualitative analysis, and a quantitative one at the level of local communities. Beyond their usefulness and significance of documentary source, these documents should be regarded as being subjective because they were managed by priests (every priest is then an exponent to promote demographic and confessional "realities" and such realities were viewed from the perspective of his own religious convictions). The parish registers, however, prove to be the only documents that allow us to penetrate the privacy of individuals in each community. A documentary is also undeniably a good dowry that researchers should promote and use in their research not only locally but also to verify and demonstrate certain behaviours and overall trends. ...|$|R
