40|$|The article {{deals with}} solving an {{important}} and relevant problem of enhancing the efficiency of serving production shops by a freight railway station at a large-scale metallurgical enterprise. The process of handling freight railway <b>cars</b> <b>flow</b> at a freight railway station was considered. The main functions of the station, {{as well as its}} relations to production shops were identified. The main factors influencing the idle time of freight railway cars, which they spend waiting for loading and transport operations, as well as rolling stock turnout were determined. With the purpose of time factors identification of the railway station operation a graphic model of the handling process (including empty rolling stock arriving, loading, and loaded freight cars departure to the external railway network) was designed. Basing on the results of the research it was determined that the transport operations influence most on the idle time of freight railway cars at the freight railway stations. Analysis shows that operation efficiency of a freight railway station of a metallurgical enterprise depends on proper organization of mutual interaction between transport and freight complexes within the dynamic process of incoming and outcoming freight railway <b>cars</b> <b>flow</b> handling. Obtained data make the basis for further investigation within the framework of solving the problem of enhancing the efficiency of freight railway station operatio...|$|E

The model accurately reflects the coordination conditions of <b>cars</b> <b>flow</b> connection, train makeup plan and train schedule at related yards and sections of a rail network. A new optimal-based method has been proposed to analyze the side effects on freight transport while changing distribution of passenger trains on heavy mixed traffic railway line. A case study {{has been done on}} real data of year 1997, 2000 and forecasting data of 2002 on China's Beijing-Guangzhou railway to evaluate the increasing transit time of freight goods at yards. The results show that the simulation method provides more accurate and feasible ways to analyze the influence such as staying time of cars in successive rail yards with the new changed operations...|$|E
40|$|In the Biham-Middleton-Levine {{traffic model}} cars {{are placed in}} some density p on a two {{dimensional}} torus, and move according to a (simple) set of predefined rules. Computer simulations show this system exhibits many interesting phenomena: for low densities the system self organizes such that <b>cars</b> <b>flow</b> freely while for densities higher than some critical density the system gets stuck in an endless traffic jam. However, apart from the simulation results very few properties of the system were proven rigorously to date.

30|$|The Laplace equation, z _xx + z _yy = 0, {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{fundamental}} 2 D elliptic equation which represents the steady-state condition. It arises in electrostatics, gravitation, steady-state flow of inviscid fluids and steady-state heat conduction. We have numerically solved substantially important equations like Navier–Stokes equations which are beneficial in explaining multitude of phenomena arising in science and engineering-modeling weather, ocean currents, water flowing in a pipe and air flowing around a wing. The Navier–Stokes equations find their way in a host of applications viz. creating blueprints of aircraft and <b>cars,</b> <b>flow</b> of blood in animals, designing power stations, analyzing soil, air and water pollution and a plethora of real world phenomena. These equations govern the motion of fluids and can be seen as Newton’s second law of motion for fluids. These are always solved together with the continuity equation. The Navier–Stokes equations symbolize the conservation of momentum while the continuity equation describes the conservation of mass. They form the core of fluid dynamics. Due to their complex behavior, these equations allow for a few restricted analytical solutions. In 1995, Li, Tang, Fornberg [3] discussed a compact finite difference method for the equilibrium state of non-compressible Navier–Stokes equations.|$|E

40|$|It {{is shown}} {{that a variety of}} {{deterministic}} cellular automaton models of highway traffic flow obey a variational principle which states that, for a given car density, the average <b>car</b> <b>flow</b> is a non-decreasing function of time. This result is established for systems whose configurations exhibits local jams of a given structure. If local jams have a different structure, it is shown that either the variational principle may still apply to systems evolving according to some particular rules, or it could apply under a weaker form to systems whose asymptotic average <b>car</b> <b>flow</b> is a well-defined function of car density. To establish these results it has been necessary to characterize among all number-conserving cellular automaton rules which ones may reasonably be considered as acceptable traffic rules.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study modular extendability and equimodularity of endomorphisms and E_ 0 -semigroups on factors {{with respect to}} f. n. s. weights. We show that modular extendability is a {{property}} that {{does not depend on}} the choice of weights, it is a cocycle conjugacy invariant and it is preserved under tensoring. We say that a modularly extendable E_ 0 -semigroup is of type EI, EII or EIII if its modular extension is of type I, II or III, respectively. We prove that all types exist on properly infinite factors. We also compute the coupling index and the relative commutant index for the <b>CAR</b> <b>flows</b> and q-CCR flows.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an elastic demand multimodal assignment model with transit costs depending on <b>car</b> <b>flows</b> {{in the case}} of non-exclusive bus lanes (shared lanes). This assumption implies 'non-separable' cost functions and therefore it is not generally possible to demonstrate the uniqueness of the equilibrium solution and the convergence of solution algorithms, only with the conditions proposed in literature. This model is a multimodal model because the mode choice depends on congested costs for both modes. In this paper a condition on demand models for uniqueness of equilibrium solutions is stated; that condition implies some hypotheses on transit cost functions. At this time, it is not yet proved that Logit models adopted in the proposed multimodal formulation satisfy this condition except for some test networks, as reported in the paper. However, tests on a real network showed the convergence of algorithms and uniqueness of the solution. Moreover a comparison among performances of solution algorithms is reported.

We prove that the optimal network utility obtained from the fluid-based optimization is an upper bound on the utility in the finite car system for any routing policy, both static and dynamic, under which the closed queueing network has a stationary distribution. This upper bound is achieved asymptotically under the fluid-based optimal routing policy.
