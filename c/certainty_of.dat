5|$|The {{creation}} of express trusts in English law must involve four elements for the trust to be valid: capacity, certainty, constitution and formality. Capacity {{refers to the}} settlor's ability to create a trust in the first place; generally speaking, anyone capable of holding property can create a trust. There are exceptions for statutory bodies and corporations, and minors who usually cannot hold property can, in some circumstances, create trusts. Certainty refers to the three certainties required for a trust to be valid. The trust instrument must show <b>certainty</b> <b>of</b> intention to create a trust, <b>certainty</b> <b>of</b> what {{the subject matter of}} the trust is, and <b>certainty</b> <b>of</b> who the beneficiaries (or objects) are. Where there is uncertainty for whatever reason, the trust will fail, although the courts have developed ways around this. Constitution means that for the trust to be valid, the property must have been transferred from the settlor to the trustees.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} about using prosody to {{automatically}} detect {{one aspect of}} a speaker’s internal state: their level <b>of</b> <b>certainty.</b> While past work on classifying level <b>of</b> <b>certainty</b> used the perceived level <b>of</b> <b>certainty</b> as the value to predict, we find that this quantity often differs from a speaker’s actual level <b>of</b> <b>certainty</b> as gauged by self-reports. In this work we build models to predict a speaker’s self-reported level <b>of</b> <b>certainty</b> using prosodic features. Our data is a corpus of single-sentence utterances that are annotated with (1) whether the statement is correct or incorrect, (2) the perceived level <b>of</b> <b>certainty,</b> and (3) the self-reported level <b>of</b> <b>certainty.</b> Knowing the self-reported level <b>of</b> <b>certainty,</b> {{in conjunction with the}} perceived level <b>of</b> <b>certainty,</b> allows us to assess what we will refer to as the speaker’s transparency. Knowing the self-reported level <b>of</b> <b>certainty,</b> in conjunction with the correctness of the answer, allows us to assess what we will refer to as self-awareness. Our models, trained on prosodic features, correctly classify the self-reported level <b>of</b> <b>certainty</b> 75 % <b>of</b> the time. Intelligent systems can use this information to make inferences about the user’s internal state, for example whether the user of a system has a misconception, makes a lucky guess, or needs encouragement. 1...|$|R
40|$|This article {{seeks to}} analyse the {{shift away from}} the moral <b>certainties</b> <b>of</b> the Cold War epoch and of {{humanitarian}} interventions in the 1990 s, to suggest that ‘evil’ plays a very different role in politics and international relations today. In current constructions of the world – as much more global, complex and non-linear – the past <b>certainties</b> <b>of</b> liberal internationalism {{appear to be a}} symptom of problematic moral hubris. Rather than the transcendental moral <b>certainties</b> <b>of</b> good and evil, globalization and complexity seem to suggest a more immanent perspective of emergent causality, eliciting a reflexive ethics of continual work on ‘good’ public modes of being. In which case, ‘evil’ is no longer considered to be an exception but becomes normalized as an ethical learning resource. The 2011 case of the mass killings by Norwegian Anders Breivik will be highlighted as an example of this process. This article suggests that this ‘democratization’ of evil is problematic in articulating evil as a revealed or emergent truth in the world that requires social and personal self-reflexivity, thereby suborning moral choice to onto-ethical necessity...|$|R

Sailing south around Cape Horn and staying well off shore to avoid shipping that might report Shenandoah's position, they saw no land for another 9,000 miles until they arrived back in England, having logged a total of over 58,000 miles around the world in a year's travel—the only Confederate ship to circumnavigate the globe.|$|E

5|$|In 2014–15, Massimiliano Allegri was {{appointed}} as manager, with whom Juventus won their 31st official title, {{making it a}} fourth-straight, as well as achieving a record tenth Coppa Italia for the double. The club also beat Real Madrid in the semi finals of the Champions League 3–2 on aggregate to face Barcelona in the final in Berlin {{for the first time}} since the 2002–03 Champions League. Juventus lost the final to Barcelona 3–1 after an early fourth-minute goal from Ivan Rakitić, followed by an Álvaro Morata equalizer in the 55th minute. Then Barcelona took the lead again with a goal from Luis Suárez in the 70th minute, followed by a final minute goal by Neymar as Juventus were caught out on the counterattack. On 14 December 2015, Juventus won the Serie A Football Club of the Year award for the 2014–15 season, the fourth time in succession. On 25 April 2016, the club won their fifth-straight title (and 32nd overall) since last winning five-straight between 1930–31 and 1934–35, after second place Napoli lost to Roma to give Juventus mathematical <b>certainty</b> <b>of</b> the title with three games to spare; last losing to Sassuolo on 25 October 2015, which left them in 12th place, before taking 73 points of a possible 75. On 21 May, the club then won the Coppa Italia for the 11th time and their second-straight title, becoming the first team in Italy's history to complete Serie A and Coppa Italia doubles in back-to-back seasons. On 17 May 2017, Juventus won their 12th Coppa Italia title in a 2–0 win over Lazio (the first team to win three consecutive championships). Four days later on 21 May, Juventus became the first team to win six consecutive Serie A titles. On 3 June 2017, Juventus entered a second Champions League Final in three years, but were defeated 1–4 by defending champions Real Madrid — a tragedy in Turin followed.|$|E
5|$|The {{experience}} held {{a number}} of lessons for the Australians, not least {{of all was the}} need for tanks. Although the APCs had been used to support the infantry during the operation, they lacked the firepower and armour to be an effective substitute for tanks which would likely have found the terrain and vegetation no obstacle and may have proven decisive. Meanwhile, the futility and waste of frontal tactics and massed bayonet charges against automatic weapons had once again been demonstrated. Yet such lessons still had not been fully grasped by Australian Army training doctrine, and under pressure from Townsend to press on with the attack Mackay had given the order to fix bayonets and charge due to the proximity of his forward platoons to the Viet Cong. Despite having long since ceased to be a decisive weapon of warfare, when ordered the Australians had unhesitatingly charged towards the Viet Cong machine-guns in the <b>certainty</b> <b>of</b> suffering casualties. As a result of their bravery 5 Platoon {{became one of the most}} highly decorated Australian platoons of the war. Yet aggression alone could not overcome concentrated firepower, and many survivors were later bitter about the order and losses suffered in these attempts. Another lesson identified included the need to thoroughly prepare an unsecure landing zone by fire prior to insertion. Likewise, during the initial contact A Company had been unable to call in artillery, and the need for a dedicated command and control helicopter to co-ordinate indirect fire during an airmobile assault was also evident.|$|E

Typically, {{this will be}} intended to create a trust, but there can be situations in which the settlor's intended actions create a trust accidentally, as in Paul v Constance. The creation of express trusts must involve four elements for the trust to be valid. These are capacity, certainty, constitution and formality. Capacity refers to the donor's ability to create a trust in the first place; generally speaking, anyone capable of holding property can create a trust. There are exceptions for statutory bodies and corporations, and minors who usually cannot hold property can, in some circumstances, create trusts. Certainty refers to the three certainties required for a trust to be valid. These are that the trust instrument must show <b>certainty</b> <b>of</b> intention to create a trust, <b>certainty</b> <b>of</b> what {{the subject matter of}} the trust is, and <b>certainty</b> <b>of</b> who the beneficiaries (or objects) are. Where there is uncertainty for whatever reason, the trust will fail, although the courts have developed ways around this. Constitution means that for the trust to be valid, the property must have been transferred from the settlor to the trustees. For chattels, this can simply be handing the property to them, while transfers of land and shares must be done in writing following certain prescribed forms.|$|E
