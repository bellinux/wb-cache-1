5|$|Deception {{and problem}} solving are central themes in this novel as both the thief and the central adult players {{use a variety of}} ways to hide the truth while the {{children}} employ a series of mathematical and problem-solving concepts to piece together the <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> the puzzle. In addition, Calder and Petra develop a special friendship and certain respect for the value of art.|$|E
5|$|Overall {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to past entries in the series. The player, as Alex, explores the various environments and locales, searching for <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> advance the plot, such as photographs, drawings and other items which are placed inside Alex's journal, which the player may read at any time. To assist the player, Alex will turn his head towards items and <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> inform the player that the object may be picked up; other recurring items include weapons and ammunition, which give off a glow as a visual cue to the player, and health drinks. Puzzle elements also {{play a part in}} the game, and Alex's journal may be used to refer to photographs and other items that can help the player decipher such puzzles as keypad entries. For {{the first time in the}} series, the player may select responses when engaging in dialogue with other characters encountered in the game, which in turn may affect how the player sees the plot unfold.|$|E
5|$|The letter {{caused a}} stir in the upper echelons of the Nazi regime. In his diaries, Joseph Goebbels, Reich Minister of Propaganda, assumed that someone in the German Catholic church {{organisation}} wrote, and distributed, the letter. A bounty of 100,000 Reichsmark, posted by the Führer himself, revealed no <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> its origins. Even the strongest repressive actions could not hinder {{the distribution of the}} letter.|$|E

5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Mulder and Scully {{investigate}} a man who kidnaps women and lobotomizes them. The agents' only <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> catching him are distorted photos of the victims taken just before their kidnapping.|$|E
5|$|A {{trend towards}} greater {{authenticity}} began after Hammond's orchestrations in the 1970s provided {{a basis for}} staging the work in its original form. This process was further aided by the discovery in the 1990s of Bizet's 1863 conducting score. In this, the orchestral parts were reduced to six staves, but notes and other markings in the manuscript provided additional <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> the original orchestration. These new finds {{became the basis for}} Brad Cohen's critical edition of the score, published by Edition Peters in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Cracking {{along the}} {{vertical}} join {{of the wooden}} panels was severe enough to warrant a third restoration in 1982. Raking light revealed that modern varnishes had yellowed, while further overpainting was found. Working under ultraviolet light, paint from earlier restorations was removed, uncovering lost colours and landscape details, including the snow-capped mountains and birds of prey on the upper left. Restorers found <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> sources of confusion in earlier restorations, especially the unusual positioning of Francis's tonsure and Leo's feet, which were discovered to be crossed under his body.|$|E

50|$|A clue {{without a}} home. The clue is hidden in another {{letterbox}} (similar <b>to</b> <b>clues</b> for a bonus boxes), but the letterboxer that finds the <b>clue</b> is expected <b>to</b> move the <b>clue</b> <b>to</b> another nearby letterbox. The cuckoo clue typically contains directions to limit {{how far the}} <b>clue</b> should travel <b>to</b> find a new home.|$|R
5|$|Doggett {{is taken}} to the local jail, where he meets a fellow {{prisoner}} named Domingo. Domingo is eventually freed and offers to have Doggett bailed out as well, {{under the condition that}} Doggett help him perform his criminal tasks. Doggett agrees, but changes his mind once he is released. Nestor, Domingo's friend, pulls a gun, but Doggett quickly overpowers him and takes the weapon. Doggett returns to the warehouse in hopes of finding <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> his identity. From time to time, he experiences flashbacks of his wife and son, but has no idea who they are.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, The Manuscript Books of Emily Dickinson was published. Using the {{physical}} evidence of the original papers, the poems were intended {{to be published in}} their original order for the first time. Editor Ralph W. Franklin relied on smudge marks, needle punctures and other <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> reassemble the poet's packets. Since then, many critics have argued for thematic unity in these small collections, believing the ordering of the poems to be more than chronological or convenient.|$|E
5|$|Saw {{revolves}} around the Jigsaw Killer and his test subject Detective David Tapp, the games' protagonist. Jigsaw, a serial killer who is determined to spend {{the remainder of his}} life making people appreciate their lives, gives <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> Tapp as he progresses through the game. Clues are usually delivered by Jigsaw's puppet Billy. Tapp is a veteran detective for the local police force who was recently discharged for mental instability after the loss of his partner, Steven Sing, an event which led him to develop an obsession with Jigsaw. Throughout the game, Jigsaw attempts to teach Tapp to let go of his obsession and focus on survival.|$|E

5|$|The 1988 Dungeons & Dragons {{role-playing}} game module Ruins of Adventure {{was produced}} {{using the same}} adventure scenario as Pool of Radiance, using the same plot, background, setting, {{and many of the}} same characters as the computer game. The module thus contains useful <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> the successful completion of the computer missions. Ruins of Adventure contains four linked miniscenarios, which form the core of Pool of Radiance. According to the editors of Dragon magazine, Pool of Radiance was based on Ruins of Adventure, and not vice versa.|$|E
5|$|The {{communications}} between Flight 370 and the satellite communication network operated by Inmarsat, which were relayed by the Inmarsat-3F1 satellite, provide {{the only significant}} <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> the location of Flight 370 after disappearing from Malaysian military radar at 02:22 MYT. These communications have also been used to deduce possible in-flight events (see next section). The investigative team was challenged with reconstructing the flight path of Flight 370 from a limited set of transmissions with no explicit information about the aircraft's location, heading, or speed.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{revolves}} around {{the murder of a}} Latina maid in Beverly Hills and the introduction of her cadre of associates who are also Latina maids. The maids are shown in their employment surroundings with their upper class employers who play supporting roles. The main character is not actually a maid but rather the mother of the primary murder subject who poses as a maid to gain entrance into the world where she might find <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> prove her son's innocence.|$|E

5|$|When {{taking the}} patient's medical history, {{the subject is}} {{questioned}} about any significant signs or symptoms, such as difficulty in speaking or difficulty in breathing. These may suggest obstructing lesions in various locations within the upper airway, larynx, or tracheobronchial tree. A history of previous surgery (e.g., previous cervical fusion), injury, radiation therapy, or tumors involving the head, neck and upper chest can also provide <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> a potentially difficult intubation. Previous experiences with tracheal intubation, especially difficult intubation, intubation for prolonged duration (e.g., intensive care unit) or prior tracheotomy are also noted.|$|E
5|$|A {{large portion}} of {{gameplay}} in Murder on the Orient Express has the player questioning characters and listening to lengthy periods of dialogue in order to acquire clues which {{may lead to the}} murderer. Other tasks the player must complete include collecting passports and other paraphernalia left by the passengers in an effort to acquire <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> lead to the solution of the murder, and retrieving certain objects for various characters. Combining items in the inventory forms {{a major part of the}} puzzles in the game. There are no puzzles with time limits in the game, although some puzzles require correct timing. There are also several single screen puzzles, such as a safe-cracking puzzle.|$|E
5|$|A major {{difference}} between And Then There Were None and Murder on the Orient Express that Sheldon pointed out {{was that in the}} former, the premise of the novel was that no one solved the murder. This forced Sheldon to desperately {{try to find a way}} to integrate clues into the story so that the player could actually discover the murderer, although the game remained quite uninteractive. In Murder on the Orient Express, the actual novel follows an investigation, so Sheldon could more easily integrate <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> lead to all three possible solutions. Sheldon also excised unnecessary puzzles from Murder on the Orient Express, as they were an unpopular feature of its predecessor.|$|E
50|$|All granulomas, {{regardless}} of cause, may contain additional cells and matrix. These include lymphocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, multinucleated giant cells, fibroblasts and collagen (fibrosis). The additional cells are sometimes a <b>clue</b> <b>to</b> {{the cause of}} the granuloma. For example, granulomas with numerous eosinophils may be a <b>clue</b> <b>to</b> coccidioidomycosis or allergic bronchopulmonary fungal disease, and granulomas with numerous neutrophils suggest blastomycosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, aspiration pneumonia or cat-scratch disease.|$|R

5|$|As {{the first}} half of the period is largely prehistoric, {{archaeology}} plays an important part in studies of early Medieval Scotland. There are no significant contemporary internal sources for the Picts, although evidence has been gleaned from lists of kings, annals preserved in Wales and Ireland and from sources written down much later, which may draw on oral traditions or earlier sources. From the 7th century there is documentary evidence from Latin sources including the lives of saints, such as Adomnán's Life of St. Columba, and Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People. Archaeological sources include settlements, art, and surviving everyday objects. Other aids to understanding in this period include onomastics (the study of names) – divided into toponymy (place-names), showing the movement of languages, and the sequence in which different languages were spoken in an area, and anthroponymy (personal names), which can offer <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> relationships and origins.|$|E
5|$|At Castle Brunwald, Indy rescues Henry, but {{learns that}} Elsa and Donovan are {{actually}} {{working with the}} Nazis, and are using him to find the Grail for them. Meanwhile, Marcus is captured in Hatay, while waiting with Sallah for the Joneses. The Joneses escape from Castle Brunwald. Henry tells Indy that to reach the Grail, one must face three booby traps and his diary contains the <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> guide them through the challenges safely. They recover the diary from Elsa at a book burning rally in Berlin. They then board a Zeppelin to leave Germany, but the Nazis soon discover the Joneses are aboard and they escape in a parasite biplane. They crash while engaging in a dogfight with Luftwaffe fighters.|$|E
5|$|At the White House, brainwashed teleporting mutant Nightcrawler {{attempts}} to assassinate the President of the United States but fails and escapes. Meanwhile, Wolverine explores an abandoned military installation at Alkali Lake in Alberta for <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> his past, but finds nothing. He returns to Professor Xavier's school for mutants, and Xavier tracks Nightcrawler using Cerebro. Xavier and Cyclops go {{to question the}} imprisoned Magneto about the attack, while X-Men Storm and Jean Grey retrieve Nightcrawler. Meanwhile, military scientist Colonel William Stryker approaches the president and receives approval to investigate Xavier's mansion for their ties to mutants. Stryker's forces invade the school and abduct some of the students. Colossus leads the remaining students to safety while Wolverine, Rogue, Iceman, and Pyro escape, and Stryker's assistant Yuriko Oyama captures Cyclops and Xavier. During the attack Wolverine confronts Stryker, who knows him by name.|$|E
