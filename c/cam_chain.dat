50|$|Manufactured from 1987 to 1996 in the USA to late 1999 in {{the rest}} of the world, the Hurricane went through only three major revisions. In 1989, the bike {{received}} a cosmetic makeover with a complete redesign of the front fairing, improvements to the bike's front suspension, larger tyres were added to help cope with the bike's heavy weight and to accommodate radial tyres, improvements were also added to the bike's <b>cam</b> <b>chain</b> tensioner in an attempt to remove the annoying <b>cam</b> <b>chain</b> rattle some riders had reported. The 1989 model also had its power slightly increased, and it gained weight.|$|E

5000|$|The ZB50 is {{a street}} legal motorcycle, {{powered by a}} 4-stroke 49 cc {{overhead}} cam engine. Unlike the Z50R, the ZB50 engine features a roller bearing camshaft, an automatic <b>cam</b> <b>chain</b> tensioner, and a 10:1 compression ratio, NGK CR6HS spark plug.1 ...|$|E
50|$|These engines were cam in head <b>cam</b> <b>chain</b> driven, {{units with}} carburetors in the 1960s and 1970s,but was later fitted with Bosch fuel {{injection}} {{in the early}} 1980s.A special 24v head design appeared on the Carlton/Omega and Senator {{in the beginning of}} the 1990s,this was later turbocharged by Lotus for the 1990s Lotus Omega/Carlton.|$|E

5000|$|Power {{transmission}} requires fewer mechanical parts. The {{problem of}} breakage of parts like gears, <b>cams,</b> belts and <b>chains</b> is not involved.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{versions of}} the M42 developed problems with the camshaft chain drive. The hydraulic tensioner, chain guides, idler wheel and rear lower chain case have all been updated to resolve mechanical wear problems experienced in the early {{versions of the}} M42. Since the updated <b>cam</b> <b>chain</b> tensioner is shared with the M44, people commonly refer to the revised tensioner as a [...] "M44 tensioner".|$|E
50|$|According to Honda engineers, the 499 cc {{parallel}} twin DOHC engine {{was designed to}} last for 300000 km. One motorcycle was tested by Moto Revue from 1993 through 1996. Dismantled at 50000 km, the engine was in perfect condition. At 100000 km only the <b>cam</b> <b>chain</b> and the pistons were replaced, although, in the tester's opinion, it could have run with the original parts for longer with no problems.|$|E
50|$|The changes {{extended}} to the engine where Honda's late 1970s issues with cam chains were dealt with via the introduction of an automatic tensioner replacing the manual version on the earlier models. Other changes also meant that the standard valve clearances were reduced, possibly through tighter manufacturing control. Sports model engines are identifiable via {{the lack of a}} <b>cam</b> <b>chain</b> tensioner bolt and the revised valve covers which feature black painted stripes and satin alloy flat areas.|$|E
50|$|The {{front brake}} system {{was a single}} inboard {{ventilated}} disc that was developed to improve brake performance and feel. This was only seen on Honda models for a few years, before a switch to sintered metal brake pads with the more traditional disc/caliper arrangement. Other features included a hydraulic clutch, Comstar wheels with tubeless tyres, TRAC anti-dive front forks and Pro-Link rear suspension. Engine coolant passed {{through one of the}} frame tubes. The early UK specification model had built-in front fairing indicators, and optional radiator side-cowls and belly pan. Following the VT250F, the VT250 Spada and VTR250 were produced. A full fairing VT250F2 was also produced to help the rider from being fatigue at high speeds it also featured double row <b>cam</b> <b>chains.</b> Later models also came with an aluminium box frame. The engine redlined at 13500 rpm. The engine also tends to heat up causing severe damage to the crankshaft bearings. It is advised to use only 10W/40 engine oil for v-twins and v-four engine motorcycles.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} Ford-issued {{block was}} machined differently to improve strength. In {{place of the}} single-cam arrangement, an endless duplex hydraulically tensioned timing chain was used to drive the overhead <b>cams.</b> The <b>chain</b> measured 2.2 m. The casting and bearings for the standard underhead cam were repurposed for a shaft which drove the oil pump. Ignition was controlled by a EDIS-6 system, which would become a standard feature.|$|R

5000|$|From 1967 to 1968: {{the machine}} had a 4 stroke 360 degree {{parallel}} twin; air cooled; single overhead <b>cam</b> (<b>chain</b> driven); cylinders inclined 30 degrees forward from vertical ("sloper" [...] engine) with 9:1 compression ratio; max 17 bhp @ 10,500 rpm. From 1969 to 1979 {{it had a}} similar 4 stroke engine but with vertical cylinders ("vertical" [...] engine); max 15 bhp @ 10,000 rpm. Both engines used a single Carburetor. Electrics were 6 volt (battery ignition).|$|E
5000|$|For all body styles, the {{powertrain}} of the Favorit {{used one}} internal combustion petrol engine, , inline-four-cylinder, four-stroke, liquid-cooled, overhead valve, {{which was an}} upgraded version of the [...] engine used in the Škoda 1000MB. This initially produced a rated motive power output of [...] at 5,000 rpm. It originally used either a Pierburg 2E-E Ecotronic single-barrel carburettor, or a Pierburg Ecotronic dual-barrel carburettor. This engine had its combustion chambers redesigned by Ricardo Consulting Engineers in the UK, while German car maker Porsche helped engineer the engine mountings. Throughout its timescale in the Favorit, the engine was progressively upgraded with various iterations of emissions control systems, including {{two different types of}} catalytic converter, and also utilised improved fuelling and engine control by way of Bosch Mono-Motronic single-point fuel injection. These changes had minor effects on the rated power (50kW) and torque outputs. The engine requires the <b>cam</b> <b>chain</b> changed every 60,000 km, but it can last over 200,000 km (cases of engines working 400,000 km without the change of <b>cam</b> <b>chain</b> are known, although with serious degradation of performance, respectively). The chain is relatively short, but has no tensioner.|$|E
5000|$|... 1994: [...] Updates to the {{ignition}} timing due to {{adoption of the}} pent-roof combustion chamber design, the internal structure of the muffler, and {{the shape of the}} <b>cam</b> <b>chain</b> links for reduced mechanical noise. The engine mount location was updated for improved handling. A new instrument cluster appeared with the analogue fuel gauge moved to a central location from previously within the tachometer face, a row of indicator LEDs below the clocks, and a hazard light switch. Weight increased by 1 kg.|$|E

30|$|We {{conclude}} that even for low penetration rates, series {{vehicles equipped with}} VANET technology according to current standardization have to handle several hundreds of messages per second under challenging conditions. Considering the usual restrictions for automotive hardware and software regarding robustness, size, and cost, {{there are two ways}} to deal with this challenge, with the option to combine both of them. First, the hardware capabilities are dimensioned sufficiently high which in turn leads to higher costs and potentially larger size. Second, the <b>CAM</b> processing <b>chain</b> is designed sufficiently smart. For instance, the CAM processing engine may serve most important CAMs preferably so that only least important CAMs are discarded. We proposed such an algorithm in [35].|$|R
50|$|The TLS motor {{featured}} a 90° V-twin for perfect primary balance and had hybrid chain/gear driven cams. A traditional <b>cam</b> <b>chain</b> turned a gear {{that in turn}} rotated the cams. This hybrid design eased maintenance immensely and gave the motor additional aural character because of the gear whine. The motor was also used for the Suzuki TL1000R. Suzuki also sold many of the TL motors to Cagiva {{to be used in}} the Navigator and V-Raptor models. Bimota also used the engine for their popular Bimota SB8K.|$|E
5000|$|Mid-1996: Changed valve cover, added bracket to hold <b>cam</b> <b>chain</b> bumper; changed crank to heavier unit; {{improved}} {{clutch basket}} with 1 more clutch plate; changed countershaft sprocket retainer from slotted plate to large nut; changed {{second and third}} gear ratios. Kickstarter no longer fits with new clutch basket. At least some early 1996 models had the matte black engine cases and covers rather than the later hammer-finished dark gray coloration found in the 1997 and later models. New left balancer weight/sprocket begins with engine #KLE650AE032206.|$|E
50|$|The cam lobes act {{directly}} on bucket type tappets, which are adjusted {{by means of}} shims between {{the underside of the}} bucket and the top of the valves. Two duplex chains drive the camshafts, one from the crankshaft to a sprocket {{at the level of the}} combustion chambers, and one from the sprocket to each camshaft. The original sprung slipper design of the lower <b>cam</b> <b>chain</b> tensioner proved to be too weak and after a couple of years was changed to an improved hydraulic design, using engine oil pressure.|$|E
40|$|We have {{isolated}} a myosin (referred to as 170 -kD myosin) from lily pollen tubes, {{which consists}} of 170 -kD heavy <b>chain</b> and calmodulin (<b>CaM)</b> light <b>chain</b> and is responsible for cytoplasmic streaming. A 170 -kD polypeptide that has similar antigenicity to the 170 -kD myosin heavy chain of lily pollen tubes was also present in cultured tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) Bright Yellow- 2 (BY- 2) cells, and possessed the ability to interact with F-actin in an ATP-dependent manner. In addition to this myosin, we identified biochemically another kind of myosin in BY- 2 cells. This myosin consisted of a <b>CaM</b> light <b>chain</b> and a 175 -kD heavy chain with antigenicity different from the 170 -kD myosin heavy chain. In the present study, we referred to this myosin as 175 -kD myosin. This myosin was able to translocate rhodamine-phalloidin (RP) -labeled F-actin at an average velocity of about 9 μm/s in the motility assay in vitro. In contrast, the sliding velocity of RP-labeled F-actin translocated by fractions containing the 170 -kD myosin was 3 to 4 μm/s. The velocity of cytoplasmic streaming in living BY- 2 cells ranged from 2 to 9 μm/s. The motile activity of 175 -kD myosin in vitro was inhibited by Ca 2 + at concentrations higher than 10 − 6 m. Immunoblot analyses using an antiserum against the heavy chain of 170 - or 175 -kD myosin revealed that in tobacco plants, the 175 -kD myosin was expressed in leaf, stem, and root, but not in germinating pollen, while 170 -kD myosin was present {{in all of these}} plant parts and in germinating pollen. These results suggest that the two types of myosins, 170 and 175 kD, presumably participate in cytoplasmic streaming in BY- 2 cells and other somatic cells of tobacco plants...|$|R
40|$|Myosin V {{isolated}} from chick brain (BM V) is a multimeric protein of about 640 kDa {{consisting of two}} intertwined heavy chains of 212 kDa and multiple light chains of 10 to 20 kDa.

50|$|All 335 Series V8s {{shared the}} same 4.38 in bore spacing and {{cylinder}} head bolt pattern as the Windsor V8s. Beyond these shared aspects, the 335 Series engines are very different internally from the somewhat similar-looking Windsor series. The 335 series V8s use smaller 14mm spark plugs and the radiator hose locations differ between the Windsor and 335 engines. The Windsor engines route coolant through the intake manifold, with the hose protruding horizontally, while the 335 engines had a dry manifold with the radiator hose connecting vertically to the cylinder block above the <b>cam</b> timing <b>chain</b> cover. The Cleveland has a square-shaped rocker cover while the Windsor has a more rounded cover. All 335 covers are secured with eight bolts; the Windsor uses six bolts. All of the 335 series engines differ from the Windsor engines by having a roughly 2-inch extension {{at the front of}} the block which forms an integrated timing cover casting.|$|R
5000|$|The {{four-cylinder engine}} {{featured}} double overhead cams, with hydraulic lifters which eliminated valve adjustments. The exhaust was a four-into-two finished in black chrome. The engine layout {{was the same}} as the 650 Nighthawk's, but of a different design sharing no parts. [...] The bike also featured shaft drive, electronic ignition, a digital gear indicator, an automatic <b>cam</b> <b>chain</b> adjuster, a spin-on automobile-style oil filter, and Honda’s second-generation TRAC (Torque Reactive Anti-dive Control) front end control system. Tire size in both front and rear was 16 inches. Brakes were double disc in front, drum in rear.|$|E
5000|$|Early {{models of}} the M42 {{experienced}} failures of a profile gasket sealing the lower <b>cam</b> <b>chain</b> case to {{the underside of the}} cylinder head. [...] This gasket seals the primary coolant passage within the timing chain case. A significant failure would thus discharge pressurized steam and hot coolant into the timing chain case. In many cases this coolant rapidly contaminates the motor oil in the sump, causing main bearing failure. BMW updated the profile gasket material and instituted a program to repair motors under warranty. In extreme cases, the aluminum mating surfaces in the head and chain case would corrode.|$|E
5000|$|In 1985, {{a revised}} version of the XLV750R was introduced, bearing the {{additional}} designation [...] "F". The XLV750R(F)-models were improved in some details (tamer cams resulting in 6 hp less power, improved automatic <b>cam</b> <b>chain</b> tensioners, improved carburetor setup, among other minor modifications) and had a black engine and golden rims with black hubs. These motorcycles were painted in the colour combinations black/blue metallic, black/red metallic and black/silver grey and were mainly marketed in Italy, France, and Australia. Honda never officially offered them in Germany, probably because the demand was very low due to the mainly negative press the XLV had received there (see for example [...] and [...] ).|$|E
40|$|Most {{manufacturing}} enterprises now employ compute {{numerical control}} (CNC) technology in their production chain. Improving {{the performance and}} flexibility of the computer aided design (CAD) /computer aided manufacturing (<b>CAM)</b> /CNC <b>chain</b> can therefore, {{have a significant effect}} on the competitiveness of such enterprises. Whereas hardware capabilities of these systems have increased proactively over the last few decades, the software components have been updated reactively to support the enhancements found on the newer generation of CNC machines. This passive approach has led to severe incompatibilities between the various CAD/CAM/CNC solutions. This paper presents the impediments and issues arising from such incompatibilities and proposes a new framework to overcome these barriers in achieving interoperability in the CAD/CAM/CNC chain. In the suggested framework different components of the CAD/CAM/CNC chain can exchange information with one another regardless of their native standards. The different elements comprising the framework are demonstrated by utilizing a test component in a dynamic manufacturing scenario...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the dynamic {{modelling}} of a recent mechatronic device called independent carts system. Different companies gave different commercial names, but the mechanics behind is the same: different linear motors on a closed loop, controlled individually to increase the flexibility but keeping the speed of dedicated solutions, such as mechanical <b>cams</b> or <b>chains.</b> The proposed model covers both the mechanical and control parts of the systems. In this paper the preliminary results are shown, and the model is validated on a real independent carts system by Rockwell Automation. The mechanical model {{is assumed to be}} a planar model and the moving carts are supposed to be rigid bodies moving along a rail. Friction and gravity effect are taken into account. The electrical model comprises three PID control loops. The aim of this model is to simulate the behavior of the system in order to evaluate different scenarios and architectures of new machines, decreasing the cost of development and the time to market...|$|R
5000|$|The 3T-GTE, first {{released}} in September 1982, {{is the most}} performance oriented version of the 1,770cc 3T engine. It features a hemi chambered 8v twin-cam head with twin-spark (two spark plugs per cylinder) design and swirl inlet ports for better efficiency. The EFI system saw the introduction of knock control. It is turbocharged by a Toyota CT20 Turbo (the same unit as used in the 2L-T diesel) to generate 160 PS (119 kW) at 6,000 rpm and 152 lb·ft (206 N·m) at 4,800 rpm. This was the first turbocharged twin-cam engine built in Japan. Units built after May 1983 received a water cooled turbocharger. The engine was considerably over-engineered for durability, for instance featuring doubled <b>cam</b> roller <b>chains,</b> as it was also to {{form the basis for}} the 4T-GT competition engines.
