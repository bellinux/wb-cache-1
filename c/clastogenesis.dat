40|$|The oncogenic BRAF(V 600 E) {{mutation}} {{is common}} in melanomas as well as moles. The roles that this mutation plays in the early events {{in the development of}} melanoma are poorly understood. This study demonstrates that expression of BRAF(V 600 E) is not only clastogenic, but synergizes for <b>clastogenesis</b> caused by exposure to ultraviolet radiation in the 300 to 320 nM (UVB) range. Expression of BRAF(V 600 E) was associated with induction of Chk 1 pS 280 and a reduction in chromatin remodeling factors BRG 1 and BAF 180. These alterations in the Chk 1 signaling pathway and SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling pathway may contribute to the <b>clastogenesis</b> and UVB sensitivity. These results emphasize the importance of preventing sunburns in children with developing moles...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} is {{to determine whether the}} quercetin in combination with cisplatin can ameliorate cisplatin-induced <b>clastogenesis</b> and apoptosis in the bone marrow cells of mice. The scoring of chromo-somal aberrations, micronuclei and mitotic activity were undertaken in the current study as markers of clastogenicity. Apoptosis was analysed by the Annexin V– propidium iodide assay and the occurrence of a hypodip-loid DNA peak. Oxidative stress markers such as bone marrow lipid peroxidation and reduced glutathione were assessed as a possible mechanism underlying this amelio-ration. Quercetin was neither clastogenic nor apoptogenic in mice at doses equivalent to 50 or 100 mg/kg for 2 days. Pre-treatment of mice with quercetin significantly reduced cisplatin-induced <b>clastogenesis</b> and apoptosis in the bone marrow cells and these effects were dose and time dependent. Prior administration of quercetin ahead of cisplatin challenge ameliorated oxidative stress markers. Overall, this study provides {{for the first time that}} quercetin has a protective role in the abatement of cisplatin-induced <b>clastogenesis</b> and apoptosis in the bone marrow cells of mice that resides, at least in part, in its antioxidant effects. Therefore, quercetin can be a good candidate to decrease the deleterious effects of cisplatin in the bone marrow cells of cancer patients treated with this drug...|$|E
40|$|Genotoxic {{effects of}} {{therapeutic}} ultrasound are poorly documented, {{when compared with}} the wide use of this physical agent. The aim of this work was to investigate the clastogenic and aneugenic potential of 1 MHz ultrasound, employing intensities (200 and 300 mW/cm 2) above the cavitational threshold, but in the range of those normally used in therapeutics. Both normal fibroblasts (AG 01522) and tumoral cells (MCF- 7) were sonicated. While no effects on viability were noted, significant increases of CREST-negative micronuclei (indicative of <b>clastogenesis)</b> and CREST-positive micronuclei (indicative of aneuploidy) were detected. <b>Clastogenesis</b> was confirmed by increases of Î³-H 2 AX foci, while increases of spindle anomalies confirmed the induction of aneuploidy. Our results confirm previous works that showed ultrasound-induced DNA breakage. Moreover, our experiments show that the known effect of ultrasound-induced damage to microtubules is also able to damage the mitotic spindle and induce aneuploidy. On the overall, this work highlights the importance to further investigate the potential risks related to therapeutics US...|$|E
40|$|Superoxide-mediated <b>clastogenesis</b> is {{characteristic}} for various chronic inflammatory diseases with autoimmune reactions and probably {{plays a role}} in radiation-induced <b>clastogenesis</b> and in the congenital breakage syndromes. It is consistently prevented by exogenous superoxide dismutase (SOD), but not by heat-inactivated SOD, indicating that the anticlastogenic effect is related to the catalytic function of the enzyme. Increased superoxide production by activated monocytes/macrophages is followed by release of more long-lived metabolites, so-called clastogenic factors, which contain lipid peroxidation products, unusual nucleotides of inosine, and cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α. Since these components are not only clastogenic, but can stimulate further superoxide production by monocytes and neutrophils, the genotoxic effects are self-sustaining. It is shown here that anticlastogenic effects of exogenous SOD are preserved despite extensive washing of the cells and removal of all extracellular SOD. Using flow cytometry and confocal laser microscopy, rapid adherence of the fluorescently labeled enzyme to the cell surface could be observed with slow uptake into the cell during the following hours. The degree of labeling was concentration and time dependent. It was most important for monocytes, compared with lymphocytes, neutrophils, and fibroblasts. The cytochrome c assay showed significantly diminished O 2 − production by monocytes, pretreated with SOD and washed thereafter. The preferential and rapid binding of SOD to monocytes may be of importance not only for the superoxide-mediated genotoxic effects, described above, but also from a therapeutic standpoint. It can explain the observation that beneficial effects of injected SOD lasted for weeks and months despite rapid clearance of the enzyme from the blood stream according to pharmacodynamic studies...|$|E
40|$|Chromosome {{abnormalities}} and the {{mitotic index}} in lymphocyte cultures and micronuclei in buccal mucosa cells were investigated {{in a sample}} of underground mineral coal miners from Southern Brazil. A decreased mitotic index, an excess of micronuclei and a higher frequency of chromosome abnormalities (fragments, polyploidy and overall chromosome alterations) were observed in the miners when compared to age-paired normal controls from the same area. An alternative assay for <b>clastogenesis</b> in occupational exposition was tested by submitting lymphocytes from non-exposed individuals to a pool of plasmas from the exposed population. This assay proved to be very convenient, as the lymphocytes obtained from the same individuals can be used as target as well as control cells. Also, it yielded a larger number of metaphases and of successful cultures than with common lymphocyte cultures from miners. A significantly higher frequency of chromatid gaps, fragments and overall alterations were observed when lymphocytes from control subjects were exposed to miner plasma pools. Control plasma pools did not significantly induce any type of chromosome alterations in the cultures of normal subjects, thus indicating that the results are not due to the effect of the addition of plasma pools per se...|$|E
40|$|Vitamin B(6) {{has shown}} to be a {{potentially}} effective antioxidant agent, and dietary antioxidants are also frequently valuable inhibitors of <b>clastogenesis</b> and carcinogenesis. The purpose of the present work was to study the clastogenicity of different doses of vitamin B 6 and to examine the possible modulating effect of this vitamin on chromosomal damage induced by the antitumor agent doxorubicin in Wistar rats. Experimental groups were set up for pre-and simultaneous treatment with vitamin B 6 alone or in combination with DXR. The data obtained from administering diVerent doses of vitamin B(6) (12. 5 - 100 mg/kg b. w.) showed no signigicant increase in total chromosomal aberrations when compared with the negative control. The administration of two doses of 25 mg/kg b. w. or one dose of 50 mg/kg b. w. of vitamin B 6 before doxorubicin injection seemed equally effective in protecting cells against doxorubicin clastogenicity. The anticlastogenic effect of vitamin B(6) on DXR-induced chromosomal damage could be ascribed to its antioxidant properties. Vitamin B 6 was not clastogenic or cytotoxic in rat bone marrow cells and it plays a role in inhibiting the clastogenicity induced by DXR. FAPESPCNPqCAPE...|$|E
40|$|Bovine {{papillomavirus}} (BPV) {{is considered}} a useful model to study HPV oncogenic process. BPV interacts with the host chromatin, resulting in DNA damage, which is attributed to E 5, E 6, and E 7 viral oncoproteins activity. However, the oncogenic mechanisms of BPV E 6 oncoprotein per se remain unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the mutagenic potential of Bos taurus papillomavirus type 1 (BPV- 1) E 6 recombinant oncoprotein by the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay (CBMNA) and comet assay (CA). Peripheral blood samples of five calves were collected. Samples were subjected to molecular diagnosis, which did not reveal presence of BPV sequences. Samples were treated with 1 [*]μg/mL of BPV- 1 E 6 oncoprotein and 50 [*]μg/mL of cyclophosphamide (positive control). Negative controls were not submitted to any treatment. The samples were submitted to the CBMNA and CA. The results showed that BPV E 6 oncoprotein induces <b>clastogenesis</b> per se, which is indicative of genomic instability. These results allowed better understanding the mechanism of cancer promotion associated with the BPV E 6 oncoprotein and revealed that this oncoprotein can induce carcinogenesis per se. E 6 recombinant oncoprotein has been suggested as a possible vaccine candidate. Results pointed out that BPV E 6 recombinant oncoprotein modifications are required {{to use it as}} vaccine...|$|E
40|$|Ptaquiloside, a norsesquiterpene {{glycoside}} from bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), is a known carcinogen towards animals. Its genotoxicity {{is mainly}} attributed to its DNA-alkylating and clastogenic properties. This study analyses various modes of genotoxic action of ptaquiloside in human mononuclear blood cells. The alkaline comet assay {{was performed on}} cells exposed to 5 μg/ml ptaquiloside for 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 min. Tail length {{was used as a}} DNA-damage parameter. Assays to determine structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations and sister-chromatid exchange were conducted on cells exposed to 5, 10 or 20 μg/ml ptaquiloside for 48 h. The tail length showed maximum DNA damage at 20 - 30 min, diminishing onwards. Highly significant (p< 0. 001) dose-dependent increases in structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations and SCE were observed in response to ptaquiloside. These results indicate that ptaquiloside is not only a DNA-alkylating agent, but expresses its genotoxicity through multiple mechanisms including <b>clastogenesis,</b> aneugenesis and the mechanism underlying SCE induction, which is not entirely understood. Recent studies support the role played by aneuploidy in oncogenesis, highlighting the importance of this endpoint for mutagenicity screening. SCE are thought to represent the long-term effects of mutagens and are an important genotoxicity biomarker. The present results also agree with data from epidemiological studies and from animal in vivo studies, further supporting the hypothesis that ptaquiloside may represent a significant threat to human health...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{formation}} of clastogenic factors (CF) and their damaging effects are mediated by superoxide, since superoxide dismutase is regularly protective. CF are produced via superoxide and stimulate {{the production of}} superoxide by monocytes and neutrophils. This results in a selfsustaining and longlasting process of <b>clastogenesis,</b> which may exceed the DNA repair system and ultimately lead to cancer (Emerit, 1994). An increased cancer risk is indeed observed in conditions accompanied by CF formation. These include irradiated persons, patients with chronic inflammatory diseases, HIV-infected persons and the chromosomal breakage syndromes ataxia telangiectasia, Bloom’s syndrome and Fanconi’s anemia. Biochemical analysis has identified lipid peroxidation products, arachidonic acid metabolites, nucleotides of inosine and cytokines, in particular tumor necrosis factor alpha, as the clastogenic and also superoxide stimulating components of CF. Due to their chromosome damaging effects, these oxidants can be detected with classical cytogenetic techniques. Their synergistic action renders the CF-test particularly sensitive {{for the detection of}} a pro-oxidant state. Correlations were observed between CF and other biomarkers of oxidative stress such as decreases in total plasma thiols or increases in TBARS or chemiluminescence. Correlations between CF and disease activity, between CF and radiation exposure, suggest the study of CF for monitoring these conditions. CF may also be useful as biochemical markers and intermediate endpoints for the evaluation of promising antioxidant drugs. CF formation represents a link between chronic inflammation and carcinogenesis. Prophylactic use of superoxide scavengers as anticarcinogens is therefore suggested...|$|E
40|$|DNA {{damage is}} a {{critical}} factor in the initiation of chemically induced toxicities (including cancer), and the repair of this damage represents the cell’s first line of defense against the deleterious effects of these agents. The various mechanisms of DNA repair are reviewed briefly and the actions of the DNA repair protein 06 -alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (ATase) are used to illustrate how DNA repair can protect cells against alkylating agent-induced toxicities, mutagenesis, <b>clastogenesis,</b> and carcinogenesis. The effec-tiveness of this repair protein can be measured based on its ability to deplete levels of its promutagenic substrate O 6 -methylguanine (O 6 -meG) in the DNA of cells. These studies reveal that the repair of O 6 -meG from DNA occurs heterogeneously, both intra- and intercellularly. Even in cells that repair O 6 -meG hyperefficiently, certain regions of chromatin DNA are repaired with difficulty, and in other regions they are not repaired at all; most likely this lack of repair {{is a result of the}} location of the lesion in the DNA sequence. When individual cells are compared within a tissue, some cells are clearly repair deficient, because the O 6 -meG can persist in DNA for many weeks, whereas in other cells, it is removed within a matter of hours. The role of these repair-deficient cells as targets for alkylating agent-induced carcinogenesis is considered. The mechanisms of the homeostatic control of DNA repair function in mam...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{compounds}} which can selectively protect normal tissues against radiation injury is of immense use because {{in addition to}} it protecting the normal tissue, will also permits use of higher doses of radiation to obtain better cancer control and possible cure. However, most of the radio protective compounds investigated possess inadequate clinical application principally due to their inherent systemic toxicity at their optimal protective concentrations. Plants commonly used as medicinal and dietary agents have recently {{been the focus of}} attention and studies have shown that Ocimum sanctum Linn. commonly known as the Holy Basil and its water soluble flavonoids, orientin and vicenin protects experimental animals against the radiation-induced sickness and mortality at nontoxic concentrations. Studies with tumor bearing mice have also shown that both Tulsi extract and its flavonoids selectively protect the normal tissues against the tumoricidal effects of radiation. Preclinical studies have also shown that the aqueous extract of the Tulsi leaves; its flavanoids orientin and vicenin, and eugenol, the principal nonpolar constituent present in Tulsi prevent radiation-induced <b>clastogenesis.</b> Mechanistic studies have indicated that free radical scavenging, antioxidant, metal chelating and anti-inflammatory effects may contribute toward the observed protection. In addition, clinical studies with a small number of patients have shown that Tulsi was effective as a radio protective agent. This review summarizes the results related to the radio protective properties of Tulsi and its phytochemicals and also emphasizes the aspects that warrant future research to establish its use as a radio protective agent...|$|E

40|$|Certain {{hexavalent}} chromium [Cr(VI) ] compounds are human lung carcinogens. Although much {{is known about}} Cr-induced DNA damage, very {{little is known about}} mechanisms of Cr(VI) mutagenesis and the role that DNA repair plays in this process. Our goal was to investigate the role of excision repair (ER) pathways in Cr(VI) -mediated mutagenesis in mammalian cells. Repair-proficient Chinese hamster ovary cells (AA 8), nucleotide excision repair (NER) -deficient (UV- 5) and base excision repair (BER) -inhibited cells were treated with Cr(VI) and monitored for forward mutation frequency at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) locus. BER was inhibited using methoxyamine hydrochloride (Mx), which binds to apurinic/apyrimidinic sites generated during BER. Notably, we found that both NER-deficient (UV- 5 and UV- 41) and BER-inhibited (AA 8 + Mx) cells displayed attenuated Cr(VI) mutagenesis. To determine whether this was unique to Cr(VI), we included the alkylating agent, methylmethane sulfonate (MMS) and ultraviolet (UV) radiation (260 nm) in our studies. Similar to Cr(VI), UV- 5 cells exhibited a marked attenuation of MMS mutagenesis, but were hypermutagenic following UV exposure. Moreover, UV- 5 cells expressing human xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group D displayed similar sensitivity to Cr(VI) and MMS-induced mutagenesis as AA 8 controls, indicating that the genetic loss of NER was responsible for attenuated mutagenesis. Interestingly, Cr(VI) -induced <b>clastogenesis</b> was also attenuated in NER-deficient and BER-inhibited cells. Taken together, our results suggest that NER and BER are required for Cr(VI) and MMS-induced genomic instability. We postulate that, in the absence of ER, DNA damage is channeled into an error-free system of DNA repair or damage tolerance...|$|E
40|$|The role of lime in the {{formation}} of reactive oxygen species (ROS), i. e, O ° H 202, and OH-, from betel-quid components (extracts of areca nut and catechu) was investigated in vitro using a chemiluminescence technique and an assay for oxidative DNA damage involving analysis of 8 -hydroxy- 2 '-deoxyguanosine. Of the various areca-nut extracts, the catechin fraction, at alkaline pH, was shown to be the most active producer of ROS. The free Ca(OH) 2 content and pH of lime samples (a component of betel quid and chewing tobacco) were highly correlated with the generation of ROS from areca-nut extract in vitro and with oxidative base damage to DNA in vitro. While Fe 2 + had an enhancing effect on ROS formation, Mg 2 + had a marked inhibitory effect. The cytogenetic effects of ROS generated in vivo were measured in Syrian golden hamsters in which the cheek pouch had been painted with lime and an areca-nut extract or catechu, singly or in combination. The frequency of micronucleated cells was increased only in animals that had received both the areca-nut extract and lime. The frequency of micronucleated cells in exfoliated oral mucosal cells from Indian chewers of betel quid with tobacco containing lime or of tobacco with lime was significantly higher than in a control (no habit) group. These studies demonstrate that addition of lime to betel quid constituents generates ROS, which induce cytogenetic damage in hamster cheek pouch and may contribute to the cytogenetic damage observed in the oral cavity of betel-quid chewers. These results implicate ROS in <b>clastogenesis</b> and probably in the etiology of oral cancer...|$|E
40|$|Methods: Primary {{fibroblast}} cultures {{were obtained}} by biopsy from affected and non-affected skin from SSc patients. Control fibroblasts were derived from skin remnants from plastic surgery in healthy adults. the number of micronuclei-bearing cells per 1000 binucleated cells (MN(+) cells/ 1000 BN) was determined in cultures with and without clastogenic stimulus (bleomycin 3 mu g/mL). Results: Primary cultures from 10 SSc patients (affected and non-affected skin) and nine controls were analysed by two blinded examiners. {{in the absence of}} bleomycin, the frequency of MN(+) cells was higher in cultures from affected (14. 01 +/- 11. 96 MN(+) cells/ 1000 BN; p = 0. 004) and non-affected (15. 41 +/- 13. 58 MN(+) cells/ 1000 BN; p = 0. 005) skin from SSc patients as compared to fibroblasts from healthy controls (4. 74 +/- 3. 30 MN(+) cells/ 1000 BN). in bleomycin-treated cultures, the frequency of MN(+) cells was higher in SSc affected (38. 03 +/- 26. 14 MN(+) cells/ 1000 BN; p = 0. 041) and non-affected skin (38. 47 +/- 17. 88 MN(+) cells/ 1000 BN; p = 0. 034) as compared to healthy control fibroblasts (20. 54 +/- 13. 09 MN(+) cells/ 1000 BN). There was no difference in the frequency of MN(+) cells in cultures from affected and non-affected skin of SSc patients. Conclusions: This is the first demonstration that dermal fibroblasts from SSc patients present an increased frequency of spontaneous and clastogen-induced micronuclei. Increased <b>clastogenesis</b> seems to be a widespread phenomenon in SSc because fibroblasts from clinically affected and non-affected skin presented the equivalent increased micronuclei counts.

40|$|Estuarine sediments may be {{reservoirs}} of hydrophilic and hydrophobic pollutants, many {{of which}} are acknowl- edged genotoxicants, pro-mutagens and even potential carcinogens for humans. Still, studies aiming at narrowing the gap between ecological and human health risk of sediment-bound contaminant mixtures are scarce. Taking an impacted estuary as a case study (the Sado, SW Portugal), HepG 2 (human hepatoma) cells were exposed in vitro for 48 h to extracts of sediments collected from two areas (urban/industrial and Triverine/agricultural), both contaminated by distinct mixtures of organic and inorganic toxicants, among which are found priority mutagens such as benzo[a]pyrene. Comparatively to a control test, extracts of sediments from both impacted areas produced deleterious effects in a dose–response manner. However, sediment extracts from the industrial area caused lower replication index plus higher cytotoxicity and genotoxicity (concerning total DNA strand breakage and <b>clastogenesis),</b> with emphasis on micronucleus induction. On the other hand, extracts from the rural area induced the highest oxidative damage to DNA, as revealed by the FPG (formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase) enzyme in the Comet assay. Although the estuary, on its whole, has been classified as moderately contaminated, the results suggest that the sediments from the industrial area are significantly genotoxic and, furthermore, elicit permanent chromosome damage, thus potentially being more mutagenic than those from the rural area. The results are consistent with contamination by pro-mutagens like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), potentiated by metals. The sediments from the agriculture-influenced area likely owe their genotoxic effects to metals and other toxicants, probably pesticides and fertilizers, and able to induce reactive oxygen species without the formation of DNA strand breakage. The findings suggest that the mixtures of contaminants present in the assayed sediments are genotoxic to HepG 2 cells, ultimately providing a useful approach to hazard identification and an effective line-of-evidence in the environmental monitoring of anthropogenically-impacted coastal ecosystems.
