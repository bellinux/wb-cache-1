40|$|Measurement of the {{vibrations}} of plates can offer significant {{challenges to the}} experimentalist, particularly when the plates are lightweight, exhibit large amplitude deflections, nonlinear responses or are initially curved. The use of accelerometers adds masses which can change the dynamics of lightweight plates. Large amplitude oscillations and initial curvatures cause complications when using a laser vibrometer, as they {{make it difficult to}} get consistent reflections back to the receiver. Furthermore, large or nonlinear oscillations challenge inherent assumptions on which the vibrometer’s algorithms depend. A high speed video camera avoids these issues, but makes it hard to extract numerical data. This paper describes a method that extends the capabilities of a high speed video camera by using a mirror, allowing post-processing software to stereoscopically resolve an array of points on the plate surface to 3 D coordinates, capturing the complete shape and position of the plate throughout vibration. This method avoids all the problems mentioned above and gives very clear insight into plate vibration. Some example results of this method are presented, using thermally bistable <b>carbon</b> <b>laminate</b> plates filmed at a 1000 frames per second.

40|$|Composite {{material}} patching is a {{very promising}} method for repairing and/or reinforcing metallic structures. In order to apply this, investigation of the joint strength and properties needs to be done. This master thesis concerns the fracture mechanical properties of adhesive composite patching. In particular a bimaterial carbon fiber-steel joint, separated with a epoxy/glass layer for galvanic protection, is examined. The aim for the thesis {{is to establish a}} critical energy release rate for a bimaterial joint through DCB and ENF testing and apply this as input to FE modeling. The thesis begins with an explanation of composite patch technology and its relevance to industry. Subsequently, relevant theory applied in the thesis is presented. At first, basic fracture mechanics and data reduction methods are explained. In addition are formulas for laminate theory, cohesive zone size and statistics, given. A thorough specification of specimen geometry and production follows. This includes an overview of existing standards and literature reviews. The FE model with its constitutives and specifications are given in a separate chapter. Documentation of testing and test setups follows, prior to a separate section with result presentation. A discussion of the results, and a conclusion, is included at the end. Production of specimens was done with 3 different methods of introducing a galvanic protection layer between the steel and carbon fiber laminate. Further, the steel had two different surface treatments. One grit blasted surface and one laser treated. Bond line thickness for the different production methods and surface characterization, was established. The mode II energy release rate was determined with reliable test results. The mode I testing was troubled with delamination and load introduction through hinges, hence unambiguous results could not be obtained. Despite this, mode I results give an indication of joint properties. A grit blasted surface with a galvanic protection layer cured under vacuum, prior to <b>carbon</b> <b>laminate</b> bonding, yielded the highest mode II energy release rate. The chosen cohesive law for the FE model corresponded well with the failure mechanism of a bond with low interface capacity. A non coinciding compliance in the FE models is believed to be a case of inaccurate material data. Denne oppgaven begynner med en forklaring av kompositt reparasjon teknologi og dens relevans til industrien. Følgende er relevant teori anvendt, presentert. Grunnleggende bruddmekanikk og data ekstraksjons metoder er inkludert. I tillegg er formler for laminat teori, kohesiv sone størrelse og statistikk, oppgitt. En grundig gjennomgang av prøve geometri og produksjon følger. Dette inkluderer et overblikk over eksisterende standarder og litteratur undersøkelser. Element modellen med dens konstitutiver og spesifikasjoner er gitt i eget kapittel. Dokumentasjon av testing og test oppsett følger, før et eget kapittel med resultat presentasjon. En diskusjon av resultater og en konklusjon er inkludert til slutt. Produksjonen av prøvene ble gjort med 3 ulike metoder for implementering av den galvansike beskyttelsen som ligger mellom stål og karbonfiber laminatet. Videre så hadde stålet to ulike overflatebehandlinger. En sandblåst overflate og en laser behandlet overflate. Bindings tykkelsen for de forskjellige produksjonsmetodene ble fastslått. Mode II energi-frigjørings-raten ble fastslått med pålitelige resultat. Mode I testingen var plaget av problemer med delaminering og hengsler som skulle påføre last. På grunn av dette ble ingen utvetydige resultater oppnådd. Uansett gav resultatene, om ikke annet, en indikasjon på bindingskapasiteten. En sandblåst overflate med galvanisk beskyttelse, herdet under vakuum, før karbonfiber laminatet ble pålimt, gav den høyeste energi frigjørings raten. Den valgte kohesive loven for elementmodellen hadde sammenfallende feilmekanisme med en binding som hadde lav bindingsstyrke.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to investigate the}} beneficial effect of the variable frequency microwave (VFM) technology to cure thermosetting prepreg laminates. Further, it was to investigate the interrelationship and effect on the curing process of frequency, band width, and curing time with different types of laminates. Previous studies of microwave-assisted curing of neat resins (epoxy) and unidirectional glass and <b>carbon</b> fiber <b>laminates</b> with a fixed frequency of 2. 45 GHz, have shown that a substantial reduction in the curing time was obtained. Results of this earlier work indicate that the microwave-assisted curing of multidirectional glass fiber laminates also show a substantial reduction of the required curing time. This may be explained by the penetration of microwave energy directly and throughout the laminate with enhancement of the kinetics of the chemical reaction. The fixed frequency microwave radiation of 2. 45 GHz has been demonstrated to be a partially acceptable method to cure unidirectional <b>carbon</b> fiber <b>laminates.</b> Multidirectional <b>carbon</b> fiber/epoxy <b>laminates</b> demonstrate a lack of coupling during the curing process. A direct curing of these laminates was not possible by microwave radiation with the experimental approach used in agreement with previous work. In addition to this short coming, the unidirectional laminate samples cured with the fixed frequency are visually nonuniform. Localized areas of darker colors (burn, hot spots, overheating) are attributed to the formation of standing waves within the microwave cavity. For this reason, the laminates are subject to proper rotation while curing through fixed frequency. The present research indicates that variable frequency microwave technology is a sound and acceptable processing method to effectively cure uni-, bi- or multi-directional thermosetting glass fiber laminates. Also, this methodology will effectively cure unidirectional thermosetting <b>carbon</b> fiber <b>laminates.</b> For all these cases, this technology yielded a substantial reduction in the required cure time of these <b>laminates.</b> Multidirectional <b>carbon</b> fiber <b>laminates</b> demonstrated a lack of coupling of VFM energy during the curing process...|$|R
