EBC), wort was prepared from them in the standard (congress) way and in the new quicker way. The quick method for wort preparation was based on the extraction of overground malt in hot water. The extraction lasted 5, 10, and 15 minutes. The following properties of wort were measured by the spectrophotometer: clarity (L*) a* and b*. Overall differences in the clarity (L*) and calculated total colour difference (delta E*) between the wort prepared by the tested method and the <b>congress</b> <b>wort</b> were caused by the fact that boiling water, which created conditions for Maillard reactions, was used for the extraction.

40|$|Common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is {{traditionally}} used in northern Europe {{as a source}} of fermentable extract to beer production. In Italy during the last ten years the number of brewery and micro-brewery has grown exponentially in parallel with the interest in malt and beer production whit local raw materials. Traditionally durum wheat varieties (Triticum turgidum subsp. durum) are used to pasta and bread production and few papers are present on durum wheat malting and brewing processes. This preliminary work is aimed to the development of durum wheat malt obtained from an ancient sicilian wheat variety and the study of some quality parameters for malt and wort production. The durum wheat variety “Simeto” was grown and harvested in 2015 in Sicily (Italy). The trials to produce a pale wheat malt were carried out on laboratory scale using 500 g of grains. Three consecutive cycles of steeping (16 hours) and air rest (8 hours) at 15 °C was used to obtain a 45 % of steeping degree. The grains were germinated for 5 days at 95 % of RH and 15 °C of temperature. The green malt was dried during kilning phase with initial temperature of 35 °C (8 hours) and gradually increased to 43 °C (16 hours). During the last 9. 5 hours of kilning the sample was divided in two parts to test two different final drying temperatures of 43 (SM 43) and 70 °C (SM 70). The rootlets were manually removed from the wheat malt and the samples were milled to make the chemical and physical analysis on wheat,wheat malt and <b>congress</b> <b>wort</b> derived from them. Humidity, betaglucan content betaglucanase activity, extract, colour, pH and apparent attenuation limit were determined according to Analytica EBC protocols. The main drawback during mashing with wheat malt are due to high-molecular-weight polymers (principally arabinoxylans and betaglucans). “Simeto” wheat show a betaglucan content of 0. 54 ± 0. 01 % w/w and after malting process be even lower, 0. 16 ± 0. 01 and 0. 13 ± 0. 04 % w/w, respectively for SM 43 and SM 70. The betaglucanase activity found on SM 43 was 165. 84 ± 4. 47 U/kg while for SM 70 was 142. 22 ± 5. 21 U/kg. These differences are probably due to the final drying temperature (70 °C) that partially inactivate betaglucanase enzymes. Extract (%) obtained from EBC <b>congress</b> <b>wort</b> show no significant difference between SM 43 and SM 70, respectively 81. 22 ± 1. 65 and 81. 68 ± 0. 87 % on d. b., in accordance with those reported in literature for typical pale wheat malt (81. 00 - 86. 00 % d. b.). The wort color found for both durum wheat malts was very pale, 3. 04 ± 0. 69 and 3. 28 ± 0. 15 EBC units, respectively for SM 43 and SM 70. The results show that “Simeto” wheat variety was suitable to pale malt production. The different temperatures used at the end of kilning phase do not significantly influence the qualitative parameters except for the betaglucanse activity. The malts production from ancient durum wheat varieties, could represent a new interesting way to further enrich the sources of fermentable products encouraging the maintenance of biodiversity. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Pilsner malt, one of {{the main}} {{ingredients}} for the production of beer, is made in a three-step production process which involves subsequent steeping, germination and kilning. Compared to pilsner malt, dark specialty malts are produced at higher temperatures. Depending on the applied drying procedure, dark specialty malts canbe further divided in colour, caramel and roasted malts. In that respect, colour malts are produced in a kiln at higher temperatures compared to pilsner malt, whereas caramel and roasted malts are manufactured in a roasting drum. The elevated temperatures applied during kilning and roasting intensify the non-enzymatic browning reactions, resulting in the formation of colour, flavour and antioxidant components. As the extent of these reactions is influenced by the reaction conditions, the presence and concentration of the previously mentioned compounds in dark specialtymalts depend on the applied processing parameters. When used for the production of beers, these malts can {{have a significant impact on}} the characteristics of the end product. In this research, the main objectives were to identify and characterise flavour components in different types of dark specialty malts and to elucidate the influence of the applied processing parameters on the development of flavour, colour and antioxidant power in caramel malts. Moreover, the evolution of dark specialtymalt flavour components during wort boiling and the influence of these malts on the flavour stability of beer was studied. First, headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography and massspectrometry was used to characterise the volatile fraction of aqueous extracts and dry ground samples of different colour, caramel and roastedmalts. Following this procedure, more than 100 compounds could be identified including oxygen-, nitrogen- and sulphur containing heterocyclic components. Since caramel-like furanones and pyranones could only be extracted out of a dry matrix, an extraction technique was optimised to determine these components in dry ground malts. These results revealed that the malt type, and as a consequence the production process, had an important influence on the presence of components. In that respect, caramel-like flavour components such as maltol and furaneol proved to be present in the highest concentrations in caramel malts, whereas greatest amountsof the roasted-like pyrazines were found in roasted malts. In addition,no clear relationship between the malt colour and the concentration of flavour components could be established. Besides flavour components, malt characteristics such as moisture content, extract content and pH also mainly depended on the type of dark specialty malt. The influence of the time and temperature of the roasting process on the development of malt characteristics was studied during the production of caramel malt. This process comprises an initial saccharification step and a subsequent caramelisation step. During the first phase, the optimal formationof the reducing sugars, glucose and maltose, and free amino acids was closely related to the optimal temperatures of activity of the involved enzymes. As expected, it became clear that the time and temperature of the latter phase had an important influence on the evolution of several malt characteristics such as the moisture content, extract, pH, colour andreducing power. The development of important flavour components was highly influenced by the roasting temperature and the moisture content of the malt kernels. Moreover, the obtained results indicated that flavour development was not linked to the colour formation. The use of darkspecialty malts in the grist proved to have a significant impact on thecolour and the presence of flavour components in the sweet wort. Boiling, however, resulted in an increase of the wort colour and the TBA value, which depended on the used dark specialty malt type. Although a part of the flavour components present in the sweet wort evaporated during boiling, pyrazines proved to be present in a considerable amount in the boiled wort. Branched- 2 -alkenals, however, evaporated almost completely outof the wort, whereas β-damascenone accumulated. If unaltered during fermentation, these components can possibly contribute to the global beer flavour. In a last chapter, the influence of dark specialty malts on the beer flavour stability was studied. On the one hand, these results indicated no significant difference in global appreciation betweenboth fresh beers. On the other hand, a cocoa, caramel flavour was ascribed to the fresh caramel malt beer, whereas marzipan, bread-like flavours characterised the colour malt beer. After thermally forced ageing, caramel and fruity flavours decreased, whereas cardboard and ribes notes increased. The analytical results showed that the concentration of severalknown staling markers increased during ageing. However, few of these components were likely to contribute to the global flavour due to their high flavour thresholds. In conclusion, this work provides new insights in the presence of flavour components in different types of dark specialty malts and the development of these compounds together with some important malt characteristics during the production process of caramel malts. Finally, a light was shed on the behaviour of dark specialty malts during the brewing process and their influence on the flavour stability of beer.
