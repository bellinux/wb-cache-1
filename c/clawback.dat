25|$|Section 954 of Dodd–Frank {{deals with}} <b>clawback</b> of {{compensation}} policies, which work {{to ensure that}} executives do not profit from inaccurate financial reporting. These provisions require the SEC to create regulations that must be adopted by national stock exchanges, which in turn require publicly traded companies who wish to be listed on the exchange to have <b>clawback</b> policies. These policies require executives to return inappropriately awarded compensation, as set forth in section 953 regarding pay for performance, {{in the case of}} an accounting restatement due to noncompliance with reporting requirements. If an accounting restatement is made then the company must recover any compensation paid to current or former executives associated with the company the three years prior to the restatement. The SEC proposed regulations dealing with <b>clawback</b> of compensation in July 2015.|$|E

Barclays raised £7billion from investors from Abu Dhabi and Qatar. Existing Barclays shareholders complained they were not offered full pre-emption rights in this round of capital raising, even threatening to revolt at the extraordinary meeting.

2500|$|In the EU, {{managers}} {{are subject to}} the EU's Directive on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (AIFMD). According to the EU, the aim of the directive is to provide greater monitoring and control of alternative investment funds. AIFMD requires all EU hedge fund managers to register with national regulatory authorities and to disclose more information, on a more frequent basis. It also directs hedge fund managers to hold larger amounts of capital. AIFMD also introduced a [...] "passport" [...] for hedge funds authorised in one EU country to operate throughout the EU. The scope of AIFMD is broad and encompasses managers located within the EU as well as non-EU managers that market their funds to European investors. An aspect of AIFMD which challenges established practices in the hedge funds sector is the potential restriction of remuneration through bonus deferrals and <b>clawback</b> provisions.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} in July 2010, Picard {{said that he could}} potentially end up suing about half of the estimated 2,000 individual investors who withdrew more from Madoff's funds than they had invested. [...] These investors claim such recovery would cause personal hardships. For example, one 87-year-old former school secretary had made mandatory withdrawals from her retirement account and had paid taxes on the withdrawals, but Picard had sent her two letters seeking repayment of $691,372. On November 12, 2010, Picard sued five former Madoff employees: former head of operations Daniel Bonventre, former controller Enrica Cotellessa-Pitz, trader David Kugel, and employees Annette Bongiorno and Jo Ann Crupi. The suit seeks recovery of $70 million in allegedly fraudulent transfers. On November 17, 2010, Picard filed a <b>clawback</b> lawsuit seeking recover of $20.4 million in false profits from Melvyn I. Weiss and David J. Bershad, who had both previously pleaded guilty to racketeering charges in an earlier securities fraud case involving kickbacks to clients.|$|E

2500|$|The {{main reason}} to control directors’ power over share allottments and issues {{is to prevent}} shareholders’ rights being watered down if new shares are created. Under CA 2006 section 561, {{existing}} shareholders have a basic pre-emption right, to be offered any new shares first in proportion to their existing holding. Shareholders have 14 days {{to decide whether to}} buy. There are a series of exceptions under CA 2006 sections 564-567, for issuing bonus shares, partly paid shares, and employee shares, while private companies can opt out of pre-emption rules altogether. Furthermore, by special resolution (a three-quarter majority vote) under CA 2006 sections 570-571, shareholders may disapply pre-emption rights. In practice, large companies frequently give directors ad hoc authority to disapply pre-emption rights, but within the scope of a ‘Statement of Principles’ issued by asset managers. At present, the most influential guide is the document by the Institutional investors’ Pre-emption Group, Disapplying Pre-emption Rights: A Statement of Principle (...) [...] This suggests that the general practice is to disapply the pre-emption rights on a rolling basis for routine share issues (e.g. shares subject to a <b>clawback)</b> at no more than 5% of share capital each year.|$|E
2500|$|Martin also {{introduced}} {{changes to the}} equalization program, under which the Federal Government is constitutionally obligated to redistribute federal revenue to provinces having less ability to raise revenues through taxation than wealthier provinces. The goal in doing so is to ensure uniformity of public service provision across the nation. [...] This was received positively in [...] "have not" [...] provinces, but Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador sought to retain income from natural resources on federal marine territory that would generally be taken, or 'clawed back' by the federal treasury in lieu of equalization payments. In the 2004 federal election campaign, Harper provided in writing a promise that the provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia under a Conservative government would receive 100 per cent of the revenue generated from their natural resources without an equalization <b>clawback,</b> a promise he later reneged upon when elected as Prime Minister. NDP leader Jack Layton followed suit soon after with a similar guarantee, and later Martin promised that under a Liberal government both provinces would receive the same deal, except only for oil resources. [...] Negotiations over the agreement would be harsh, with Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Danny Williams, at one point ordering all Canadian flags removed from provincial government buildings in December 2004. The dispute was resolved {{when the federal government}} agreed to Martin's original campaign promise.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2016, Wells Fargo {{was issued}} a {{combined}} total of $185 {{million in fines}} for creating over 1.5 million checking and savings accounts and 500,000 credit cards that its customers never authorized. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued $100 million in fines, {{the largest in the}} agency's five-year history, along with $50 million in fines from the City and County of Los Angeles, and $35 million in fines from the Office of Comptroller of the Currency. The scandal was caused by an incentive-compensation program for employees to create new accounts. It led to the firing of nearly 5,300 employees and $5 million being set aside for customer refunds on fees for accounts the customers never wanted. Carrie Tolstedt, who headed the department, retired in July 2016 and received $124.6 million in stock, options, and restricted Wells Fargo shares as a retirement package. On October 12, 2016, John Stumpf, the then Chairman and CEO, announced that he would be retiring amidst the controversies involving his company. It was announced by Wells Fargo that President and Chief Operating Officer Timothy J. Sloan would succeed, effective immediately. [...] Following the scandal, applications for credit cards and checking accounts at the bank plummeted dramatically. [...] In response to the event, the Better Business Bureau dropped accreditation of the bank, S Global Ratings lowered its outlook for Wells Fargo to negative from stable, and several states and cities across the US ended business relations with the company. [...] An investigation by the Wells Fargo board of directors, the report of which was released in April 2017, primarily blamed Stumpf, whom it said had not responded to evidence of wrongdoing in the consumer services division, and Tolstedt, who was said to have knowingly set impossible sales goals and refused to respond when subordinates disagreed with them. The board chose to use a <b>clawback</b> clause in the retirement contracts of Stumpf and Tolstedt to recover $75 million worth of cash and stock from the former executives.|$|E

40|$|The {{marginal}} effective {{tax rate}} (METR) on personal income, explain the authors, measures the impact, on take-home pay, of federal and provincial income taxes combined {{with the impact of}} reductions and <b>clawbacks</b> of income-tested tax credits and benefits as individual or family income rises. These income-tested credits and benefits mostly target financial support to low- and middle-income families with children, or to low-income seniors. As their income rises past prescribed thresholds, <b>clawbacks</b> and reductions begin, raising the METR on each dollar of incremental income above the threshold. Policymakers interested in keeping down METRs overall, say the authors, should consider reinvigorating the personal income tax relief imperative, rather than implementing or expanding targeted benefits that make general tax relief more difficult to achieve.

50|$|The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 {{mandates}} the SEC {{to require}} that U.S. public companies include a <b>clawback</b> provision in their executive compensation contracts that is triggered by any accounting restatement, regardless of fault (whereas the <b>clawback</b> provisions per the Sarbanes-Oxley Act only applied to intentional fraud).

In practice, the Securities and Exchange commission has enforced its <b>clawback</b> powers in {{only a small number of}} cases.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{highlights}} of the law was a provision that allowed the SEC to force a company's CEO or CFO to disgorge any executive compensation (such as bonus pay or proceeds from stock sales) earned within a year of misconduct that results in an earnings restatement. [...] However, according to Gretchen Morgenson of The New York Times, such <b>clawbacks</b> have actually been rare, {{due in part to the}} requirement that the misconduct must be either deliberate or reckless. [...] The SEC did not attempt to claw back any executive compensation until 2007, and as of December 2013 had only brought 31 cases, 13 of which were begun after 2010. [...] However, according to Dan Whalen of the accounting research firm Audit Analytics, the threat of <b>clawbacks,</b> and the time-consuming litigation associated with them, has forced companies to tighten their financial reporting standards.|$|R

40|$|More than {{a decade}} after Quebec and the federal {{government}} implemented significant personal income tax rate reductions, what has happened to Quebecers’ take-home pay? This paper answers the question by looking at marginal effective tax rates (METRs) on personal income, which measure the impact of federal and provincial income taxes combined with the impact of reductions and <b>clawbacks</b> of income-tested tax credits and benefits. Income-tested credits and benefits mostly target financial support to low-to-middle income families with children and to low-income seniors. However, <b>clawbacks</b> and rate reductions apply to those credits and benefits as incomes rise above set thresholds, raising METRs for those income groups and family types. Overall, METRs are lower {{than a decade}} ago, but for many low-to-middle income Quebec families with children, they are higher. The province’s residents generally face the highest tax rates in the country, with an average METR in 2011 exceeding the national average by four percentage points.

In countries with better legal conditions, fixed fees are lower, carried interest fees are higher, <b>clawbacks</b> are less likely, and share distributions are more likely. These findings suggest legal conditions help to align the interests of managers and shareholders. More specifically, we examine which element of legal conditions matter most, and discover that corruption levels play a pronounced role in shaping fund manager fee contracts.
