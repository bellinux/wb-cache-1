5000|$|Amblyomma americanum, {{also known}} as the Lone Star Tick, the Northeastern Water Tick, or the Turkey Tick, is a type of tick {{indigenous}} to much of the eastern United States and Mexico, that bites painlessly and commonly goes unnoticed, remaining attached to its host for as long as seven days until it is fully engorged with blood. It {{is a member of the}} phylum Arthropoda, class Arachnida. The adult lone star tick is sexually dimorphic, named for a silvery-white, star-shaped spot or [...] "lone star" [...] present near the center of the posterior portion of the adult female shield (scutum); adult males conversely have varied white streaks or spots around the margins of their shields. [...] A. americanum is also referred to as the turkey tick in some Midwestern U.S. states, where wild turkeys are a common host for immature ticks. It is the primary vector of Ehrlichia chaffeensis, which causes human monocytic ehrlichiosis, and Ehrlichia ewingii, which causes human and canine granulocytic ehrlichiosis.

40|$|No test is {{available}} that can identify all potential pathogens in acute respiratory tract infections.

Five enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were used to test for the presence of antibodies to the diseases, except Taenia saginata, for which we tested for the presence of Taenia metacestode circulating antigens. The overall highest prevalence was for T. saginata (46. 4 %), with lower prevalence for Q-fever (4 %), leptospirosis (3 %), tuberculosis (1 %), and brucellosis (0. 2 %). Although {{there were no significant differences}} in the proportion of seroprevalence between sex and age of the animals sampled, there were significant differences between the provincial distributions.

40|$|The main {{atypical}} pathogens in {{respiratory tract}} infections are classified {{on the basis}} of their ability to cause atypical pneumonia. This is not a well-defined clinical entity, and it is evident that atypical pathogens can sometimes cause ‘typical’ pneumonias and vice versa.

Moreover, mixed infections caused by atypical and typical pathogens together are common. At this moment rapid and sensitive diagnostic methods are lacking. Besides numerous viruses, the main bacterial pathogens causing atypical pneumonias are Mycoplasma pneumoniae, two chlamydial species, Chlamydia pneumoniae and C. psittaci, one rickettsia, <b>Coxiella</b> <b>burnetti,</b> and several Legionella species.

Rickettsiae were always observed within vacuoles, and some infected L cells showed flattened endoplasmic reticulum as compared with uninfected cells. Rickettsiae in Vero cells were most often seen in vacuoles containing whorls of membranes ("myelin configurations") which were also seen in uninfected cells. Rickettsiae in Vero cells were pleomorphic, with acid phosphatase reaction product in their periplasmic space. This suggests either rickettsial degradation by lysosomal enzymes which penetrated the cell envelope or a penetration after the rickettsiae were dead. Vacuoles of infected Vero cells showed much more reaction product than that in infected L cells, and most rickettsiae in L cells had a normal appearance and showed no reaction product in their periplasmic space...|$|E
40|$|Members of {{the genus}} Bartonella have {{historically}} been connected with human disease, such as cat scratch disease, trench fever, and Carrion's disease, and recently have been recognized as emerging pathogens causing other clinical manifestations in humans. However, because {{little is known about}} the antigens that elicit antibody production in response to Bartonella infections, this project was undertaken to identify and molecularly characterize these immunogens. Immunologic screening of a Bartonella vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii genomic expression library with anti-Bartonella antibodies led to the identification of the sucB gene, which encodes the enzyme dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase. Antiserum from a mouse experimentally infected with live Bartonella was reactive against recombinant SucB, indicating the mounting of an anti-SucB response following infection. Antigenic cross-reactivity was observed with antiserum against other Bartonella spp. Antibodies against <b>Coxiella</b> <b>burnetti,</b> Francisella tularensis, and Rickettsia typhi also reacted with our recombinant Bartonella SucB.

40|$|Purpose: To {{detect and}} {{identify}} the aetiological agent in the peripheral blood from the cases of neonatal sepsis. Materials and Methods: Four neonates from geographically different regions of South India presented with signs of neonatal sepsis and all the routine clinical and laboratory investigations were performed. Blood culture by Bac T Alert 3 D was negative. To establish the aetiology, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for eubacterial genome and subsequent amplification with Gram positive and Gram negative primers were performed followed by deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing. Results: PCR {{for the detection of}} eubacterial genome was positive in all the four neonates and further amplification with designed Gram positive and Gram negative primers revealed the presence of Gram negative bacteria.

40|$|Chlamydia trachomatis manipulates host {{cellular}} {{pathways to}} ensure its proliferation and survival. Translocation of host materials into the pathogenic vacuole (termed 'inclusion') may facilitate nutrient acquisition and various organelles have been observed within the inclusion, including lipid droplets, peroxisomes, multivesicular body components, and membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, few of these processes have been documented in living cells. Here, we survey the localization of a broad panel of subcellular elements and find ER, mitochondria, and inclusion membranes within the inclusion lumen of fixed cells. However, we see little evidence of intraluminal localization of these organelles in live inclusions. Using time-lapse video microscopy we document ER marker translocation into the inclusion lumen during chemical fixation. These intra-inclusion ER elements resist a variety of post-fixation manipulations and are detectable via immunofluorescence microscopy. We speculate that the localization of a subset of organelles may be exaggerated during fixation. Finally, we find similar structures within the pathogenic vacuole of <b>Coxiella</b> <b>burnetti</b> infected cells, suggesting that fixation-induced translocation of cellular materials may occur into the vacuole {{of a range of}} intracellular pathogens...|$|E
40|$|In {{an effort}} to explore a {{sensitive}} taxon-specific detection system for bacteria, we sequenced the 16 S rRNA from two strains of Rickettsia rickettsii, five other rickettsiae, and <b>Coxiella</b> <b>burnetti</b> to find a probe site unique to R. rickettsii. We then synthesized a 16 -mer that hybridized only to the rRNA of R. rickettsii. Using a primer complementary to a sequence found only in rickettsial rRNA, we then generated a cDNA. We amplified the probe site in a 180 -base segment of the cDNA by using the cDNA primer and a second primer also unique to rickettsiae in a polymerase chain reaction.

40|$|The Arctic, {{even more}} so than other parts of the world, has warmed {{substantially}} over the past few decades. Temperature and humidity influence the rate of development, survival and reproduction of pathogens and thus the incidence and prevalence of many infectious diseases. Higher temperatures may also allow infected host species to survive winters in larger numbers, increase the population size and expand their habitat range. The impact of these changes on human disease in the Arctic has not been fully evaluated. There is concern that climate change may shift the geographic and temporal distribution of a range of infectious diseases. Many infectious diseases are climate sensitive, where their emergence in a region is dependent on climate-related ecological changes. Most are zoonotic diseases, and can be spread between humans and animals by arthropod vectors, water, soil, wild or domestic animals. Potentially climate-sensitive zoonotic pathogens of circumpolar concern include Brucella spp., Toxoplasma gondii, Trichinella spp., Clostridium botulinum, Francisella tularensis, Borrelia burgdorferi, Bacillus anthracis, Echinococcus spp., Leptospira spp., Giardia spp., Cryptosporida spp., <b>Coxiella</b> <b>burnetti,</b> rabies virus, West Nile virus, Hantaviruses, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTThe complement-fixation test (CFT) permits {{low-cost}} {{screening of}} serum samples for different agents {{within a single}} assay, and is {{a useful tool for}} the serological diagnosis of acute respiratory infections. This study evaluated the automated Seramat CFT system with 160 paired serum samples taken from 80 patients with acute respiratory infection in comparison with in-house CFTs against a panel of agents, including influenza A and B, adenovirus, respiratory syncitial virus, cytomegalovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, <b>Coxiella</b> <b>burnetti</b> and Chlamydia spp., and in comparison with indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) against Legionella pneumophila. Overall, the Seramat system identified 75 (88. 2 %) of the 85 seroconversions recognised by in-house CFTs or IIF. In comparison to the in-house CFTs, the correlation was 89. 2 % (66 / 74). For L. pneumophila, the Seramat system detected nine (81. 8 %) of the 11 cases diagnosed by IIF. The Seramat system also identified eight additional seroconversions that were not detected by the in-house assays; none of these seroconversions was detected by the in-house assay on retesting.

Activation of lactoperoxidase (LP) system and souring of milk were investigated as potential alternative methods to sustain the safety of milk by inhibiting certain microorganisms with known pathogenic potential. The activation of the LP-system inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli by the order of 2 log values. The inhibition of Brucella abortus was negligible. The replication of <b>Coxiella</b> <b>burnetti</b> in milk was not disturbed even after 17 h of LP-system activation at 20 oC, but {{the outcome of the}} LP-system treatment on Mycobacterium bovis could not be determined as the conventional culturing technique used to grow this organism did not allow full recovery.

Analysis of the primary structure and inhibition studies revealed that H. pylori possesses a typical procaryotic iron-containing enzyme. No other isoenzymes could be detected. Indirect gold immunostaining of H. pylori SOD with a polyclonal antibody directed against the iron-containing SOD of Escherichia coli showed a surface-associated localization of the enzyme.

40|$|The {{exposure}} of surface protein antigens on virulent phase I <b>Coxiella</b> <b>burnetti</b> was {{compared with that}} on avirulent phase II cells. Although anti-phase II antibodies did not bind to the surfaces of native intact phase I cells, they bound to phase I proteins if the proteins were solubilized for sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by immunoblotting. In addition, removal of the phase I lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by trichloroacetic acid exposed surface proteins for reactivity with anti-phase II antibodies, as shown by immunofluorescence assays, direct antibody binding, and immunoelectron microscopy using protein A-colloidal gold conjugates. Based on these observations, a simple model of phase variation is proposed to explain the apparently conflicting notions of {{the identity of the}} phase II antigen(s). The model suggests that the phase I LPS sterically hinders access of anti-phase II antibodies to a multitude of shared protein antigens, any one of which may confer phase II specificity.

Antisera to TpN 60 reacted with the groEL polypeptide of Escherichia coli, as determined by immunoperoxidase staining of two-dimensional electroblots. Electron microscopy of the isolated complex revealed a ringlike structure with a diameter of approximately 16 nm which was very similar in appearance to the groEL protein. Comparison of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of TpN 60 with the deduced sequences of the E. coli groEL protein, related chaperonin proteins from mycobacteria and <b>Coxiella</b> <b>burnetti,</b> the hsp 60 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the wheat ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase-subunit-binding protein (alpha subunit), and the human P 1 mitochondrial protein indicated sequence identity at 8 of 22 to 10 of 22 residues (36 to 45 % identity).
