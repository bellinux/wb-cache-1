5|$|Making several {{attempts}} to close on Endymion, Decatur discovered that Presidents damage limited her maneuverability, allowing Endymion to anticipate, and draw away from, positions favorable for boarding. Faced {{with this new}} dilemma, Decatur ordered bar and chain shot fired to disable Endymions sails and rigging, the idea being to shake his pursuer and allow President to proceed to a safe port without being followed. At noon, Endymion, being the much better sailer, was <b>close-hauled,</b> outpacing her squadron and leaving them behind. At 2pm, she gained on President and took position on the American ship's quarter, shooting into President {{as she tried to}} escape. Endymion was able to rake President three times and did considerable damage to her; by contrast, President primarily directed her fire at Endymion's rigging in order to slow her down during the two-hour engagement.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failed}} action, the Swedish fleet {{anchored}} off Trelleborg where King Charles was waiting with new orders to recapture Gotland. The fleet was to avoid combat with the allies {{at least until}} they reached the northern tip of Öland, where they could fight in friendly waters. When the Swedish fleet left Trelleborg on 30 May they were soon intercepted by the allied fleet, which then began a pursuit. By this time the allies had been reinforced by another small squadron and totaled 42 vessels, with 25 large and medium ships of the line. The reinforcements brought with them a new commander, the Dutch Admiral General Cornelis Tromp, one of the most renowned naval tacticians of his time. The two fleets sailed north and on 1 June passed the northern tip of Öland in a strong gale. The Swedish ships fared poorly in the rough winds, losing masts and spars. The Swedish officers formed a battle line that held together only with great difficulty. They tried to get ahead of Tromp's ships to gain the weather gage by getting between the allies and the shore, and thereby gaining an advantageous tactical position. The Dutch ships of the allied fleet managed to sail <b>close-hauled</b> faster {{than the rest of the}} force and slipped between the Swedes and the coast, taking up the crucial weather gage. Later that morning the two fleets closed in on each other and were soon within firing range.|$|E
25|$|Sail-powered {{vehicles}} travel {{over land}} or ice at apparent wind speeds that {{are higher than}} the true wind speed, <b>close-hauled</b> on most points of sail. Both land yachts and ice boats have low forward resistance to speed and high lateral resistance to sideways motion.|$|E
25|$|In June 1747 Weazel {{returned}} to port at Plymouth, where Barrington {{was replaced by}} Commander John Midwinter. There she remained until 30 August when she was joined to a squadron under Admiral Peter Warren, with orders to reinforce a British fleet in position off the French island of Ushant. Poor weather delayed the voyage, and Weazel did not reach her destination until 26 September. The fleet commander, Admiral Edward Hawke immediately allocated her the role of carrying messages between his ships of the line. On the morning of 14 October the fleet was offshore from Cape Finisterre when it encountered a French force of eight ships of the line, escorting a convoy of 252 merchant vessels. Hawke approached from the leeward while the French sailed <b>close-hauled</b> in a line ahead, expecting that he would engage in a long-range artillery duel. Instead, Hawke made the signal for a general chase, freeing his captains from the constraints of a formal battle; the British then overhauled the French line and enveloped it from rear to van, capturing six ships. Around 4,000 French sailors were captured or killed, against 757 British casualties.|$|E
500|$|The Audacious-class ironclads were {{initially}} ship rigged {{and had a}} sail area of [...] After the loss of [...] in a storm in 1870, the ships were modified with a barque rig which reduced their sail area to [...] They were slow under sail, only , {{partly due to the}} drag of the twin screws, and their shallow draft and flat bottom meant that they were leewardly when <b>close-hauled.</b> The three ships, Audacious, , and , with balanced rudders were described as unmanageable under sail alone.|$|E
500|$|The Royal Navy {{repaired}} Chesapeake {{and took}} her into service as HMSChesapeake. She served on the Halifax station {{under the command of}} Alexander Dixie through 1814, and under the command of George Burdett she sailed to Plymouth, England, for repairs in October of that year. Afterward she made a voyage to Cape Town, South Africa, until learning of the peace treaty with the United States in May 1815. Later that year a report was made concerning Chesapeakes performance in British service. Her captain observed that she was strongly constructed, but criticized the excessive overhang of the stern. He concluded that she was not a suitable ship to {{serve as a model for}} copying. Her speed under sail was not particularly impressive: [...] <b>close-hauled</b> and [...] large. In July 1819 the Commissioners of the Royal Navy put her up for sale at Plymouth. A Portsmouth timber merchant purchased her for £500; he [...] dismantled the ship and sold her timbers to Joshua Holmes for £3,450. Eventually her timbers became part of the Chesapeake Mill in Wickham, Hampshire, England, where one can still view them. In 1996 a timber fragment from the Chesapeake Mill was returned to the United States. It is on display at the Hampton Roads Naval Museum.|$|E
2500|$|A model proa, {{called a}} riwuit, is often raced by children. [...] Proas could be paddled or sailed. [...] The {{traditional}} sail {{used on the}} proa was the crab-claw sail, which generates far more lift than the more common triangular sloop rig used on small boats, particularly when reaching. [...] The sloop rig only begins to show an advantage with small angles of attack, such as encountered when <b>close-hauled.</b> This {{is the result of}} the higher aspect ratio of the sloop.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you {{can keep}} her {{hammering}} ahead <b>close-hauled</b> on the port tack, it's all I ask," [...] Vane laughed. [...] "You needn't call me unless the sea gets steeper." ...|$|E
60|$|Sailing {{with the}} wind she did her best; but in quarter-ing or when <b>close-hauled</b> she drifted terribly, as a {{nautical}} man might have guessed she would. We couldn't keep within miles of our course, and our progress was pitifully slow.|$|E
60|$|<b>Close-hauled</b> {{as was the}} Swallow {{and with}} her top-sails and mizzen reefed she was not making more than one knot to the Spaniard's five--for {{that she was a}} Spaniard was beyond all doubt judging by the haven whence she issued.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lundy!" [...] said Yeo. [...] "The south end! I see {{the head}} of the Shutter in the breakers! Hard a-port yet, and get her <b>close-hauled</b> as you can, and the Lord may have mercy on us still! Look at the Spaniard!" ...|$|E
60|$|Captain Reuben was anxiously {{gazing at}} the island ahead. They had laid their course to pass it to windward, as they sailed better, <b>close-hauled,</b> than did the Spaniard; who had not only fallen behind, but had lagged to leeward nigh half a mile.|$|E
60|$|It was a fine, bright night; all {{moon and}} stars, and white crests of waves. The breeze was light, but freshening; and <b>close-hauled,</b> poor little Jule, {{as if nothing}} had happened, was heading in for the land, which rose high and hazy in the distance.|$|E
60|$|And now {{the four}} gaping watchers in the stockade on the {{headland}} beheld the great ship creep forward under the rising cloud of smoke, her mainsail unfurled to increase her steering way, and go about <b>close-hauled</b> {{to bring her}} larboard guns to bear upon the unready fort.|$|E
60|$|Frank {{was glad}} to do it. He {{felt that he had}} seen quite enough and it would be wiser to get away before any misadventure befell them. They ran out of the channel and were {{thrashing}} <b>close-hauled</b> into a rather steep head sea when Harry spoke again.|$|E
60|$|This time, having {{missed the}} boat, {{and not being}} in the same {{position}} as in the previous instances, Wolf Larsen was compelled to resort to a different manœuvre. Running off before the wind with everything to starboard, he came about, and returned <b>close-hauled</b> on the port tack.|$|E
60|$|<b>Close-hauled</b> they tacked aweather, {{guided by}} the sound of combat, which grew in volume and {{definition}} as they approached it. Thus for an hour, perhaps. Then, as, telescope to his eye, Blood raked the haze, expecting at any moment to behold the battling ships, the guns abruptly ceased.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{could not}} want a better day, George," [...] Frank said. [...] "We can carry {{everything}} comfortably, {{and there is not}} enough wind to kick up much of a sea. As far as we are concerned, I would rather that the wind had been either north or south, so that we could have laid our course all round; as it is, we shall have the wind almost dead aft till we are round the Nab, then we shall be <b>close-hauled,</b> with perhaps an occasional tack along the back of the island, then free again back. There {{is no doubt that the}} cutters have a pull <b>close-hauled.</b> I fancy with this wind the schooners will be out of it; though if it had been a reach the whole way, they would have had a good chance.|$|E
60|$|I came on deck to {{find the}} Ghost heading up close on the port tack and cutting in to {{windward}} of a familiar spritsail <b>close-hauled</b> on the same tack ahead of us. All hands were on deck, for they knew that something was to happen when Leach and Johnson were dragged aboard.|$|E
60|$|When day {{broke the}} {{schooner}} was sailing fast, <b>close-hauled,</b> with her lee channels {{in the water}} and the white seas breaking over her weather bow. Aynsley found his father sitting {{at the foot of the}} mainmast, which was the only dry spot. It looked as if he had been on deck since midnight.|$|E
60|$|The {{distance}} {{run that}} night, satisfied us all that Mons. Le Compte {{was a good}} draftsman. The schooner ran 106 miles in twelve hours, against a very respectable sea, which was at least ten or fifteen more than the Crisis could have done under the same circumstances. It is true, that what was <b>close-hauled</b> for her, was not <b>close-hauled</b> for us; and, in this respect, we {{had the advantage of}} her. Marble was so well pleased with our night's work, that when he came on deck next morning, {{the first thing he did}} was to order a bottle of rum to be brought him, and then all hands to be called. As soon as the people were up, he went forward, got into the head, and commanded every body to muster on the forecastle. Marble now made a speech.|$|E
60|$|They {{brought the}} {{schooner}} around {{when she had}} {{stretched out on the}} one tack a couple of miles, and, standing in again <b>close-hauled,</b> found the ice thicker than ever. Then she came around once more, and, until the early dusk fell, Wyllard stood at the jarring helm or high up in the forward shrouds.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ahead, is it? You {{must know}} better, O'Driscol; {{though it is}} little enough you know of ships. You see we are <b>close-hauled,</b> {{and there is no}} doubt that that is the vessel's strong point. Why, we have dropped the rest of them like hot potatoes, and if this little breeze keeps on, maybe we shall be in the Tagus days and days before them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You can do {{your tongue}} wagging {{when we are}} clear of this {{blooming}} town," [...] Hiram cried sharply. [...] "Stories will keep; but there's no telling how soon the wind may shift against us, for we are sailing mightily <b>close-hauled.</b> What about this lover of the king's?" [...] and he stooped over the man whose head had received Archie's blow as well as mine.|$|E
6000|$|... “There is a sail {{coming up}} from behind. She looks to me <b>close-hauled.</b> If both ships come on they are bound to meet; if one is French {{and the other is}} English they are likely to have a talk to each other. In that case {{we should be able to}} tell friend from foe by the colours, and could then make for the English ship.” ...|$|E
60|$|The English {{go to the}} westward again: {{but it is only}} {{to return}} on the {{opposite}} tack; and now begin a series of manoeuvres, each fleet trying to get the wind of the other; but the struggle does not last long, and ere noon the English fleet have slipped <b>close-hauled</b> between the Armada and the land, and are coming down upon them right before the wind.|$|E
60|$|Beating out aweather, {{against the}} gentle landward breeze he beheld a great ship on their {{starboard}} bow, that he conceived {{to be some}} three or four miles off, and--as well as he could judge her at that distance--of a tonnage equal if not superior to their own. Even as he watched her she altered her course, and going about came heading towards them, <b>close-hauled.</b>|$|E
60|$|Day broke, {{grey and}} chill. The boat was <b>close-hauled</b> on a fresh breeze and the compass {{indicated}} {{that we were}} just making the course which would bring us to Japan. Though stoutly mittened, my fingers were cold, and they pained from the grip on the steering-oar. My feet were stinging from the bite of the frost, and I hoped fervently that the sun would shine.|$|E
60|$|They {{were now}} {{running up the}} Ray {{in pursuit of the}} boat, which had drifted into {{shallower}} water {{near the end of the}} island, and here the grapnel had brought it up. When they got up to it, the grapnel was raised and brought into the stern of the boat, and the coast-guard boat laid her course <b>close-hauled</b> for Leigh, towing the other behind her.|$|E
60|$|The Osprey {{rounded the}} {{lightship}} two lengths ahead, the Phantom came next, three lengths before the Chrysalis, {{and the others}} followed in quick succession. The sheets were hauled in, and the yachts were able to lie <b>close-hauled</b> for Ventnor. The three leading boats maintained their respective places, but drew out from each other, and when they passed Ventnor the Osprey was some five lengths ahead of the Phantom.|$|E
60|$|They let her drift {{while they}} looked gloomily to windward, where the island lay. It {{would need a}} stern effort to reach it unless the wind should change; {{a long stretch of}} foaming sea which the sloop must be driven across <b>close-hauled</b> divided the men from the wreck. They were all worn out and depressed; and neither of Moran’s comrades protested when he got up {{abruptly}} and slacked off the mainsheet.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{tipped the}} man who is {{at the head of the}} sail-making gang a five-pound note to take special pains with them, and the money would have been well laid out if it had been fifty times as much; for it will make the {{difference}} of a point at least when she is <b>close-hauled,</b> and that means getting away from a fellow too big for us, instead of being overhauled by him." ...|$|E
60|$|Jimmy said nothing--he had partly {{expected}} this; {{and while}} he smoked his second pipe, the vapors were rolled apart, and the breeze came down on them. Unfortunately {{it came from the}} northwest, which, as the sawmill they were bound for stood {{at the head of a}} deep inlet on the west coast of Vancouver Island, was ahead of them; so for a while they let her stretch out into the Pacific, <b>close-hauled</b> upon the starboard tack.|$|E
6000|$|... "That craft seems faster {{when she}} gets her sails wing-and-wing than she is even <b>close-hauled,</b> it seems to me, Yelverton," [...] {{observed}} Cuffe, after taking {{a long look at}} the chase with a night-glass; [...] "I begin to be afraid we shall lose her. Neither of the other ships does anything to help us. Here we are all three, dead in her wake, following each other like so many old maids going to church of a Sunday morning." ...|$|E
60|$|They got off shortly {{afterward}} and stood out to northward {{with the wind}} still ahead of them. It was a lowering day, and a short, tumbling sea was running. When {{late in the afternoon}} Carroll fixed their position by the bearing of a peak on the island, he pointed out the small progress they had made. The sloop was then plunging <b>close-hauled</b> through the vicious slate-green combers, and thin showers of spray flew all over her.|$|E
60|$|They {{reached its}} {{entrance}} presently, sailing <b>close-hauled,</b> and on stretching across it the canoe plunged viciously on a short, white-topped sea. The {{wind was blowing}} straight down the deep rift in the hills, and Frank remembered with regret that Alberni stood a long way up {{at the head of}} the inlet. They came back on the other tack, making almost nothing, and the Siwash pulled the masts down before one of them spoke to Mr. Oliver.|$|E
