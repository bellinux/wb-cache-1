25|$|Let f be a {{continuous}} map from R to Rℓ (R {{in the lower}} limit topology). Since R is connected, {{and the image of}} a <b>connected</b> <b>space</b> under {{a continuous}} map must be connected, the image of R under f must be connected. Therefore, the image of R under f must be a subset of a component of Rℓ. Since this image is nonempty, the only continuous maps from R to Rℓ, are the constant maps. In fact, any continuous map from a <b>connected</b> <b>space</b> to a totally disconnected space must be constant.|$|E
25|$|In {{topology}} {{and related}} branches of mathematics, a <b>connected</b> <b>space</b> is a topological space that cannot be represented as {{the union of}} two or more disjoint nonempty open subsets.

50|$|There may be {{different}} notions of connectedness that are intuitively similar, but different as formally defined concepts. We might wish to call a topological <b>space</b> <b>connected</b> if each pair of points in it is joined by a path. However this condition {{turns out to be}} stronger than standard topological connectedness; in particular, there are <b>connected</b> topological <b>spaces</b> for which this property does not hold. Because of this, different terminology is used; spaces with this property are said to be path connected. While not all <b>connected</b> <b>spaces</b> are path <b>connected,</b> all path <b>connected</b> <b>spaces</b> are <b>connected.</b>|$|R

2500|$|If X {{has only}} finitely many {{connected}} components, then each component is the complement of a finite union of closed sets and therefore open. [...] In general, the connected components {{need not be}} open, since, e.g., there exist totally disconnected spaces (i.e., [...] for all points x) which are not discrete, like Cantor space. [...] However, the connected components of a locally <b>connected</b> <b>space</b> are also open, and thus are clopen sets. [...] It follows that a locally <b>connected</b> <b>space</b> X is a topological disjoint union [...] of its distinct connected components.

40|$|According to {{a general}} {{definition}} of discrete curves, surfaces, and manifolds. This paper focuses on the Jordan curve theorem in 2 D discrete spaces. The Jordan curve theorem says that a (simply) closed curve separates a simply connected surface into two components. Based on the definition of discrete surfaces, we give three reasonable definitions of simply <b>connected</b> <b>spaces.</b> Theoretically, these three definition shall be equivalent. We have proved the Jordan curve theorem under the third definition of simply <b>connected</b> <b>spaces.</b> The Jordan theorem shows the relationship among an object, its boundary, and its outside area. After {{the publication of the}} first version of the paper (L. Chen, Note on the discrete Jordan Curve Theorem. In: SPIE Conf. on Vision Geometry VIII, vol. 3811, pp. 82 - 94. (1999).), we found some statements in the original proof of the Jordan Curve Theorem were not explained well. One case was not proven in details. In this revision, we added two more minor definitions and make the proof more solid and sound when it is needed for embedding a discrete surface into a Euclidean space.
