40|$|International audienceThe {{contributions}} of anodic and <b>cathodic</b> <b>reactions</b> to the acoustic emission recorded during crevice corrosion of 304 L {{austenitic stainless steel}} have been investigated. During the experiments, crevice propagation was localised on an anodic sample, whereas the <b>cathodic</b> <b>reactions</b> were isolated on a separate specimen. The application of shot-peening to the anodic and/or cathodic sample surfaces allowed control over the distribution of anodic and <b>cathodic</b> <b>reactions</b> on both specimens. The shot-peening treatment led to an increased crevice propagation rate, due {{to an increase in}} the cathodic current density. It has been established that the most energetic acoustic emissions originate from <b>cathodic</b> <b>reactions,</b> whereas anodic processes are associated with more numerous but shorter AE signals. During crevice development, the <b>cathodic</b> <b>reactions</b> begin with the reduction of O 2 and/or H 2 O 2 on the cathodic specimen, but later involve H+ reduction in the so-called 'anodic' confined area. The involvement of proton reduction within the crevice as a driving force for crevice propagation has been confirmed by analysis of the acoustic emission data...|$|R

In the illustration, oxygen is being reduced to water at the cathode, though other electron acceptors can be used. If water is regenerated there is a closed loop in terms of electron flow (similar to a conventional photovoltaic system), i.e. light energy is the only net input required for production of electrical power. Alternatively, electrons can be used at the cathode for electrosynthetic reactions that produce useful compounds, such as the reduction of protons to hydrogen gas.|$|E
50|$|Concentrations of {{polyphosphates}} or phosphonates with zinc and chromates {{or similar}} compounds have been maintained in cooling systems to keep heat exchange surfaces clean so {{a film of}} gamma iron oxide and zinc phosphate may inhibit corrosion by passivating anodic and <b>cathodic</b> <b>reaction</b> points. These increase salinity and total dissolved solids, and phosphorus compounds may provide the limiting essential nutrient for algal growth contributing to biofouling of the cooling system or to eutrophication of natural aquatic environments receiving blowdown or OTC water. Chromates reduce biofouling in addition to effective corrosion inhibition, but residual toxicity in blowdown or OTC water has encouraged reduced chromate concentrations and use of less flexible corrosion inhibitors. Blowdown may also contain chromium leached from cooling towers constructed of wood preserved with chromated copper arsenate.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} AC-induced {{voltages}} on corrosion systems was investigated. Two cases were distinguished: the anodic and cathodic reactions were under activation control, the anodic reaction was under activation {{control and the}} <b>cathodic</b> <b>reaction</b> was under mixed control. For the first case simple relations could be derived that relate the AC-induced voltage with the corrosion potential and corrosion rate. For the second case numerical analysis was necessary to obtain these relations. It was shown that {{the influence of the}} AC-induced voltages on the corrosion behaviour strongly depended on the Tafel parameters. As the <b>cathodic</b> <b>reaction</b> was under mixed control the increase of the corrosion rate was limited to the diffusion-limited current density. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Corrosion {{protection}} of light metal alloys, including aluminum and its alloys, often involves {{the application of}} a chemical coating, such as a chromate. Chromates appear to be active coatings, which can repair themselves at defect sites. However, concerns over the environmental hazards that chromates present demand replacement by more environmentally friendly materials. Currently there are no entirely suitable replacements for the chromate coatings. More importantly, it is difficult to design such a replacement, as the mechanism by which chromates reduce corrosion is unclear. The research conducted provides information regarding the role chromates have in reducing corrosion of some aluminum alloys. ^ It was found that the controlling reaction for corrosion is the oxygen <b>cathodic</b> <b>reaction.</b> This reaction is oxygen in water being reduced to form hydroxyl ions. If the rate of the oxygen reaction can be reduced, then aluminum corrosion will decrease. This appears {{to be one of the}} roles chromate has, in that it reduces the reaction rate of the <b>cathodic</b> <b>reaction</b> on the surface. It is therefore suggested that chromate conversion coatings are successful on many different surfaces because they decrease the <b>cathodic</b> <b>reaction</b> rate. It is apparent then that the cathodic current density is a good measure of the corrosion resistance of these alloys and can be used to quantify the effectiveness of coatings designed to replace chromates. ...|$|E

40|$|The overall process {{enhancement}} {{by different}} electrical current application on the biological phosphorus release and uptake have been investigated. Five reactors were constructed for three experiments and activated sludge {{was used as}} inoculums.

Moreover, the electrochemical effects of the cathodic and the anodic reactions on the phosphorus release and uptake, respectively, have been further evaluated separately under an electrical current application of 10. mA in Exp. 2 and Exp. 3, respectively. As observed, both of the biological release and uptake were improved by the <b>cathodic</b> <b>reactions</b> in the cathode reactor, but not by the anodic reactions in the anode reactor, and thus indicated that the <b>cathodic</b> <b>reactions</b> play an important role in the improvement of the biological phosphorus release and uptake. © 2012 Elsevier B.

In acidic solutions, the active form of corrosion occurring is controlled by the kinetics of the <b>cathodic</b> <b>reaction</b> (predominantly hydrogen evolution). In the pH range (7 to 10), the lowered <b>cathodic</b> <b>reaction</b> rate reduces overall zinc corrosion rates.
