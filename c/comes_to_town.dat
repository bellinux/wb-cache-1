25|$|Some {{classical}} and modern scholars have analyzed Abraham's reasoning for hiding Sarah's position as his wife. Rashi argued {{that when a}} stranger <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>town,</b> the proper thing {{to do would be}} to inquire if he needs food and drink, not whether his female companion is a married woman, and hence as Abimelech did the latter, it tipped off Abraham {{to the fact that there}} is no fear of God in this place, and so he lied about his relationship with Sarah in order to avoid being killed. Christian interpretation of the incidents has varied considerably. Some commentators have seen them as regrettable exceptions in the lives of those who otherwise lived upright lives, comparable to Noah's and Lot's drunkenness and David's adultery.|$|E

25|$|After {{dropping}} out of high school, Foley pursued standup comedy {{for about a year}} in the Toronto Second City Training Centre, where he began taking improv classes and met Kevin McDonald, who gave him a job as an usher at a local art house movie theatre. He played Lewis Allen in the miniseries Anne of Avonlea. Foley, McDonald, Bruce McCulloch, Mark McKinney and Scott Thompson formed The Kids in the Hall, which debuted on television from 1988 to 1995. Foley played some characters, including Hecubus, one of the Sizzler sisters, the A. T. & Love boss, Bruno Puntz Jones, Mr. Heavyfoot, Jocelyn and Lex. Initially involved with , he left the troupe {{in the middle of the}} writing, dissatisfied with the internal strife and the quality of the script, and joined the NewsRadio cast instead. As he had not signed any contract with the studio, Foley agreed to sign a deal which would allow the rest of the troupe to get paid for the script, though he was convinced that it would never be shot. When it was greenlit, Foley did the film because he was contractually obligated. He is the only member of the group who is uncredited as a writer. Foley rejoined the troupe in 2000 and has been an integral part of their various reformations. He appeared in the Kids in the Hall 2010 reunion project Death <b>Comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Town.</b> Paul Simms, creator of NewsRadio, happened to be a huge fan of Foley's work and wrote the role of Dave Nelson specifically for him. Much of his character on the show was based on his own personality quirks, including his coffee addiction and his love of the sitcom Green Acres.|$|E

Viki recovers and later donates a kidney to daughter Megan suffering terminal lupus, but Megan dies, leaving Viki devastated. Growing ever-distant from Clint, Viki engages an extramarital affair with Sloan Carpenter (Roy Thinnes); she and Clint divorce in 1994, and she marries Sloan. Sloan dies soon after from Hodgkin's lymphoma, just as {{the existence of a}} second child of Victor and Irene's is revealed. Viki's stress reaches a critical point when Dorian (Robin Strasser onward) tells Viki a secret of which she thought Viki had been aware: the fact that Victor had sexually abused his daughter as a child. With this trauma being what had actually initiated Viki's dissociative identity disorder, she subsequently splinters into several personalities, one of which imprisons Dorian in a secret room below Llanfair. Dorian is eventually freed from her confinement, and Viki recovers after realizing she herself (more specifically, one of her alternate personalities) {{was the one who had}} smothered Victor to death in 1976. In 1995, reviled town outcast Todd Manning (Roger Howarth) is proven to be Victor and Irene's illegitimate son; Viki and Todd eventually become close. After a failed reconciliation attempt with Clint, Viki meets and falls in love with Ben Davidson (Mark Derwin), who is eventually revealed to be the long-lost son of Asa Buchanan (Philip Carey) and Renée Divine Buchanan (Patricia Elliott). Ben's first wife, Skye Chandler (Robin Christopher), <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>town</b> and tries in vain to keep Ben and Viki apart.|$|E

It is revealed that Dorian and her sisters were abused by their mother, Sonya Cramer, who was psychotic. Further, it was revealed that Sonya was still alive, despite being presumed dead at Dorian's original arrival in Llanview in 1973. In a heated confrontation, Sonya (Marian Seldes) tries to kill Cassie, but Dorian picks up a statue and hit her on the head, killing her own mother. Dorian and Mel are briefly apart, but eventually reconcile and marry each other at The Banner. In 1999, however, Mel goes on a trip to a publisher's conference with Viki. Dorian does not want Mel to go and they have a fight. Mel leaves angry and boarded the flight. He switches seats with Viki, and Dorian had given the flight attendant a message for Mel saying that his family needed him. The note was given to Viki, and believing the letter to be for her, leaves the plane. The plane crashes, killing Mel. Dorian blamed Viki and their age-old feud continues. Dorian later attempts to reconcile with Viki, but then hits her pregnant daughter, Jessica Buchanan (Erin Torpey) with her car, killing her baby. Dorian attempts to cover her crime, though she eventually confesses and seeks Jessica's forgiveness. In early 2000, Drake Faraday (Leigh McCloskey), an old friend of Mel's, <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>town</b> and asks Dorian to leave with him. Dorian agrees and says goodbye to her Cramer women and reconciles with Viki.|$|E

500|$|In the Winnipeg Free Press, Brad Oswald {{reviewed}} the show cautiously, writing {{it that is}} [...] "decidedly different, distinctly weird and definitely-an-acquired-taste kind of great" [...] and that some characters and scenes [...] "are edgy and uncompromising and sure to shock and offend nearly as many viewers as they amuse." [...] In the Toronto Star Raju Mudhar wrote that the [...] "humour is classic Kids, with plenty of visual gags mixed with off-colour, politically incorrect jokes" [...] and that [...] "the troupe's eye for satire remains sharp as ever". John Doyle in The Globe and Mail wrote a negative review concluding it was [...] "a dismal coda to the comedy troupe's outstanding career". Doyle identified himself as {{a fan of the}} original The Kids in the Hall series but found that this show had [...] "excruciatingly awful attempts at humour" [...] and [...] "no comic rhythm". Doyle called it [...] "appallingly slow-witted TV", [...] "mediocre and maddeningly pointless". In the Times-Colonist, Alex Strachan provided a qualified positive review writing that it was [...] "juvenile, sophomoric and deliberately unsophisticated" [...] but [...] "a joy to watch". Strachan concludes that [...] "Death <b>Comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Town</b> is easy to dismiss as being lightweight, which it is, and scattershot, which it is. There's a genuine joie de vivre at work, though. Death <b>Comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Town</b> is silly comedy for smart people." ...|$|E
