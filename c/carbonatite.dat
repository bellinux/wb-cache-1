40|$|ABSTRACT: The present work {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between whole-rock geochemistry and stable isotope composition from <b>carbonatites</b> belonging to the Tapira, Araxá, Salitre, Serra Negra, Catalão I, and Catalão II alkaline-carbonatite complexes of the Alto Paranaiba Igneous Province (APIP), central Brazil and from the Jacupiranga Complex, of the Ponta Grossa Province, southeast Brazil. The APIP complexes are ultrapotassic, comprising bebedourites, phoscorites, nelsonites, and <b>carbonatites,</b> whereas Jacupiranga is a sodic complex composed of ijolite-series rocks, syenites, <b>carbonatites,</b> and alkaline gabbros. The geochemistry data allied to mineralogical constraints allowed us to classify the <b>carbonatites</b> into five groups, and to devise a chemical index (BaO/(BaO+SrO)) to gauge the magmatic evolution of the studied <b>carbonatites.</b> The APIP <b>carbonatites</b> evolve from apatite-rich calciocarbonatites toward Ba-, Sr-, and rare earth element (REE) -rich magnesiocarbonatites. This evolution is mostly driven by apatite, phlogopite, dolomite, and calcite fractionation and consequent enrichment in monazite, norsethite, and strontianite. Stable isotope data show a wide diversity of petrogenetic processes in play at the APIP, relatively to the Jacupiranga Complex, which is interpreted {{as a result of}} the shallower intrusion levels of the APIP complexes.

25|$|Exposed {{within the}} {{interior}} of the Richat Structure are a variety of intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks. They include rhyolitic volcanic rocks, gabbros, carbonatites and kimberlites. The rhyolitic rocks consist of lava flows and hydrothermally altered tuffaceous rocks that are part of two distinct eruptive centers, which are interpreted to be the eroded remains of two maars. According to field mapping and aeromagnetic data, the gabbroic rocks form two concentric ring dikes. The inner ring dike is about 20m in width and lies about 3km from the center of Richat Structure. The outer ring dike is about 50m in width and lies about 7 to 8km from the center of this structure. Thirty-two <b>carbonatite</b> dikes and sills have been mapped within the Richat Structure. The dikes are generally about 300m long and typically 1 to 4m wide. They consist of massive carbonatites that are mostly devoid of vesicles.

25|$|The {{addition}} {{of carbon dioxide}} is relatively a much less important cause of magma formation than the {{addition of}} water, but genesis of some silica-undersaturated magmas {{has been attributed to}} the dominance of carbon dioxide over water in their mantle source regions.

At greater depths, carbon dioxide can have more effect: at depths to about 200km, the temperatures of initial melting of a carbonated peridotite composition were determined to be 450°C to 600°C lower than for the same composition with no carbon dioxide. Magmas of rock types such as nephelinite, <b>carbonatite,</b> and kimberlite are among those that may be generated following an influx of carbon dioxide into mantle at depths greater than about 70km.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe Cape Verde {{volcanic}} archipelago, {{located in}} the oceanic portion of the African plate some 500 km west of the Senegal coast, is renowned for the occurrence of <b>carbonatites</b> on at least 5 of its 10 islands. In this study we report the occurrence of about twenty new small outcrops of extrusive <b>carbonatites</b> on Brava Island (64 km 2), the south-westernmost island of the archipelago. These new occurrences are studied from geological, petrographic, mineral chemistry and whole rock (elemental and isotopic) geochemical points of view, allowing {{for a discussion of}} their petrogenesis and emphasising their geological and geochemical peculiarities {{in the context of the}} Cape Verde <b>carbonatites.</b> Most of the extrusive carbonatitic formations correspond to pyroclastic rocks, comprising magmatic and/or phreatomagmatic ash and lapilli fall deposits and one probable pyroclastic flow. Lava flows occur at one locality. The predominance of pyroclastic facies demonstrates the significant explosivity of these magmas characterised by very low viscosity. Independent of the modes of emplacement, all samples are calciocarbonatites and exhibit a remarkable compositional uniformity, considering that they represent several different eruptions and present a wide geographical dispersion. Brava extrusive <b>carbonatites</b> belong to the younger (probable Holocene – Pleistocene) volcanic sequence of the island. This feature is unique in the context of Cape Verde geology, because in the other islands (including Brava) of the archipelago <b>carbonatites</b> are commonly assigned to the basal complexes, having formed during a fairly early stage of the emerged evolution of volcanic construction. Compared with the older intrusive sövitic rocks occurring at Middle Unit of Brava Island, extrusive facies are more iron and manganese rich and yield higher contents of trace elements like Ba, Th, U, Nb, Pb and REE, but somewhat lower Sr abundances. New initial Sr and Nd isotope data (0. 703557 – 0. 703595 and 0. 512792 – 0. 512816, respectively) determined in extrusive calciocarbonatitic rocks are clearly different from those obtained in intrusive rocks (0. 703340 – 0. 703356 and 0. 512910 – 0. 512912, respectively), which demonstrates that the studied rocks were ultimately the product of a source distinct from those that produced the older intrusive <b>carbonatites.</b> Brava extrusive <b>carbonatites</b> yield isotope signatures that are clearly distinct from all other Cape Verde <b>carbonatites,</b> but akin to the Southern Cape Verde silicate rocks.

40|$|Most {{studies of}} {{compositional}} heterogeneities in the mantle, related to recycling of crustal sediments or delaminated subcontinental lithosphere, come from oceanic setting basalts. In this work, we present direct geochronological and geochemical {{evidence for the}} incorporation of recycled crustal materials in collision-related <b>carbonatites</b> of the South Qinling orogenic belt (SQ), which merges with the Lesser Qinling orogen (LQ) to separate the South and North China Blocks. The SQ <b>carbonatites</b> occur mainly as stock associated with syenites. The data presented here show that zircon from the syenites yields an age of 766 ± 25 Ma, which differs significantly {{from the age of}} primary monazite from the <b>carbonatites</b> (233. 6 ± 1. 7 Ma). The syenites contain lower initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and higher ?Nd values. This indicates that the <b>carbonatites</b> do not have genetically related with the silicate rocks, and were directly derived from a primary carbonate magma generated in the mantle. The <b>carbonatites</b> show a Sr–Nd isotopic signature {{similar to that of the}} chondritic uniform reservoir (CHUR), and parallel Sm–Nd model ages (TCHUR) of 190 – 300 Ma. However, the rocks have extremely variable Pb isotopic values straddling between the HIMU and EM 1 mantle end-members. Most carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions of the SQ <b>carbonatites</b> plot outside the field for primary igneous carbonates. Their ? 13 C shows higher value than a ‘normal’ mantle, which implies an incorporation of recycled inorganic carbon. The <b>carbonatites</b> were emplaced close to the Mianlue suture, and followed the closure of the Mianlue ocean and Triassic collision of the South and North China Blocks. However, direct melting of the subducted Mianlue oceanic crust characterized by high ?Nd and low (EM 1 -like) 206 Pb/ 204 Pb values cannot explain the CHUR-like Nd signature and the Pb isotopic trend toward HIMU in the SQ <b>carbonatites.</b> We conclude that their parental magma was derived from a source incorporating the Mianlue oceanic crust mixed with an asthenospheric (or deeper) material characterized by high Pb and low Nd isotopic values. This material represents a deep-seated Proterozoic carbonate component recycled via mantle convection or localized upwelling. Notably, this model cannot explain the isotopic compositions of the Late Triassic (209 – 221 Ma) <b>carbonatites</b> in the LQ, characterized by a mantle-derived ? 13 C, but EM 1 -like Sr–Nd–Pb isotopic compositions. This signature is best explained in terms of delamination of the lower continental crust thickened during the collision of the South and North China Blocks, and partial incorporation of the delaminated material into the LQ mantle source. Modeling of the measured Sr–Nd–Pb isotopic variations suggests that the source of the LQ <b>carbonatites</b> could be produced by mixing of 80 – 85 % of mantle material and 15 – 20 % of delaminated lower continental crust. The emplacement of the SQ and LQ <b>carbonatites</b> marked a gradual transition from a compressional tectonic regime, brought about by the collision of the South and North China Blocks to intra-orogenic extension in the waning stages of the Triassic orogeny...|$|R
