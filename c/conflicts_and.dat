40|$|Most of the {{research}} on work-family conflict has examined people working in the paid labor force while simultaneously juggling the roles of paid worker, partner, parent, and homemaker. There is limited research on female graduate students and their experiences of work-family conflict. The goals of the present study were {{to examine the relationship between}} work-family <b>conflict</b> (work-to-family <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> family-to-work <b>conflict)</b> <b>and</b> global life satisfaction, the relationship between work-family <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> domain-specific satisfactions (family satisfaction and work satisfaction), and the mediators and moderators of these relationships among a sample of female graduate students. Participants included 187 female graduate students. Both work-to-family <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> family-to-work <b>conflict</b> were hypothesized to be negatively related to domain-specific and global life satisfactions. Work/family <b>conflict</b> self-efficacy <b>and</b> perceived social support were hypothesized to be positively related to domain-specific and global life satisfactions. Neuroticism was hypothesized to be negatively related to domain-specific and global life satisfactions, whereas extraversion was hypothesized to be positively related to domain-specific and global satisfactions. These hypothesized relationships were significant except the positive relationships of extraversion to family, work, and global life satisfactions. It was also predicted that domain-specific satisfactions would mediate the relationships between work-to-family <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> global life satisfaction, <b>and</b> between family-to-work <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> global life satisfaction. Work/family <b>conflict</b> self-efficacy <b>and</b> perceived social support were hypothesized to moderate the relationships between work-to-family <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> domain-specific satisfactions, <b>and</b> between family-to-work <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> domain-specific satisfactions. Results suggested family satisfaction and work satisfaction partially mediated the relationships between work-to-family <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> global life satisfaction, <b>and</b> between family-to-work <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> global life satisfaction. Work/family conflict self-efficacy moderated both the relationship between work-to-family <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> work satisfaction, <b>and</b> between family-to-work <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> work satisfaction. No other significant moderators were found. Implications for research and practice, and limitations of the present study are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Family-to-work <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> {{enrichment}} {{indicate how}} {{participation in the}} family can influence negatively or positively participation at work, respectively. These experiences have been proved to co-occur within individuals at different levels and explain their well-being in a more nuanced way than <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> enrichment in isolation. This study examines how Spanish women <b>and</b> men experience <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> enrichment concurrently in different types and the consequences to their subjective health. First, in line with social role theory and the gendered division of household labor, we hypothesized on {{gender differences in the}} types of combined <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> enrichment experiences. Second, incorporating theory on conservation of resources and identity, we hypothesized on the consequences of the specific types of combined <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> enrichment to subjective health from a gender perspective. Using chi-square test on a sample of 236 women and 165 men, we confirmed that women and men differed in their types of combined <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> enrichment experience: the beneficial (higher enrichment than <b>conflict)</b> <b>and</b> active types (similar higher <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> enrichment) were mainly composed of women whereas the passive type (similar lower <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> enrichment) was mainly composed of men. Using a MANOVA, we confirmed that the types of combined <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> enrichment explained significant differences in subjective health in a similar way for women and men. Overall the findings debunk the belief that higher participation in family roles interferes with work more negatively among women, or that higher participation in family roles affect their health more negatively than men.

40|$|How {{should we}} characterise the {{relations}} between environmental scarcity, <b>conflict,</b> <b>and</b> migration? Most academic and policy analyses conclude that scarcities of environmental resources can have significant impacts upon <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> migration, and claim or imply that {{within the context of}} accelerating global environmental changes these impacts are likely to become more significant still. Many analyses admittedly recognise that these impacts are often indirect rather than direct and that there exist multiple ‘drivers’ of <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> migration, of which environmental stresses are but one. We argue that even these qualifications do not go far enough, however: they still overstate the current and likely future significance of environmental changes and stresses in contributing to <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> migration and underemphasise a far more important causal pathway—from <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> migration to environmental vulnerabilities.

40|$|Work-family {{imbalance}} can induce negative consequences, such as poor {{physical and}} psychological well-being for individuals. Hong Kong employees commonly agree that work-family balance is important for them, {{but it is difficult}} to balance work and family lives (Mahtani, 2006). Very few studies have comprehensively explored how to eliminate the <b>conflict,</b> <b>and</b> to enhance the integration between work and family domains. This may hinder researchers and practitioners from exploring effective strategies for promoting work-family balance. The present study explored work-family <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> enrichment among Hong Kong employees. This study examined the relationships between demands and resources in work and family lives, work-family <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> enrichment, personal and work outcomes, and optimism and Confucian work values as moderator variables. The longitudinal mediating effects of work-family <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> enrichment were examined, and potential cross-sectional and longitudinal moderating effects on the relationships between predictor variables <b>and</b> work-family <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> enrichment were also explored. A two-wave panel design was adopted with data collection separated by a ten-month interval. Questionnaires were designed for the participants and their supervisors. 509 participants at Time 1 and 208 participants at Time 2 from three universities in Hong Kong completed self-report questionnaires, and 208 supervisors of the participants completed another questionnaire at Time 2. Predictor variables at work were significantly associated with work-family <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> enrichment perceived in the work domain, and predictor variables in the family domain were significantly related to work-family <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> enrichment perceived in the family domain. Work-family <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> enrichment were significantly associated with personal and work outcomes. Mediation analyses showed that there were very few longitudinal mediating effects of work-family <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> enrichment between predictor and criterion variables. These findings suggest that work-family <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> enrichment might not consistently contribute mediating effects in the relationships between these predictor and criterion variables over time. Potential effects of optimism and Confucian work values have been rarely explored in previous Chinese work-family studies, and therefore this study examined the moderating effects of these two variables in relation to work-family <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> enrichment. However, moderating analyses indicated that there were very few cross-sectional and longitudinal moderating effects of optimism and Confucian work values confirmed in this study. Overall, the findings of this research illustrate that work-family <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> enrichment could be separately affected by demands and resources in work and family lives. Work-family <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> enrichment could also contribute significant effects on individuals’ well-being and work productivity. The results also imply that the significance of mediation and moderation effects for work-family <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> enrichment might be determined by personal factors (e. g. coping strategies of individuals) or organisational factors (e. g. organisational culture). The present study separately examined two directions of work-family <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> enrichment, which extends the understanding of these topics in the Chinese context. The findings support related Western literature that perceived work-family <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> enrichment in one domain were determined by the source in the same domain, and each direction of conflict or enrichment was associated with outcomes in the domain receiving the conflict or enrichment. These findings may extend the discussion of the relationships between potential factors and consequences of work-family <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> enrichment for Hong Kong employees. The present study also provided additional information to understand the relationships between cultural values <b>and</b> work-family <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> enrichment. The results may aid practitioners to formulate appropriate interventions, such as family-friendly employment policies and practices in enhancing work-family balance in Hong Kong...|$|R
