5|$|Former {{singer and}} pop star Junaid Jamshed had close links with Tabligh Jamaat, and his {{departure}} from his professional singing <b>career</b> <b>is</b> attributed to his inclination towards the movement.|$|E
5|$|Walton {{was a slow}} worker, {{painstakingly}} perfectionist, and his complete body of work {{across his}} long <b>career</b> <b>is</b> not large. His most popular compositions continue to be frequently performed in the twenty-first century, and by 2010 almost all his works had been released on CD.|$|E
5|$|Barbette {{continued}} to perform until the mid-to-late 1930s. Most sources report {{the year as}} 1938, while others as early as 1936 and as late as 1942. The end of Barbette's performing <b>career</b> <b>is</b> attributed {{to a number of}} causes including a fall, pneumonia, polio, or some combination of the three. All generally agree that whatever the cause, Barbette was left in extreme pain and in need of surgery and extensive rehabilitation to allow him to walk again.|$|E
50|$|Alston's <b>career</b> <b>was</b> {{handicapped}} by neurasthenia {{and other}} mental disorders which forced his hospitalization after his playing <b>career</b> <b>was</b> over.|$|R
5000|$|Although his {{big league}} <b>career</b> <b>was</b> over, his {{professional}} <b>career</b> <b>was</b> not. In fact, he was bouncing around {{the minor leagues}} as recently as 2005, and in 28 games with Double-A Frisco in 2004, he hit [...]387.|$|R
50|$|Because {{the peak}} of his <b>career</b> <b>was</b> during the Second World War, his {{international}} <b>career</b> <b>was</b> very limited. Nevertheless, he played 28 times for Argentina scoring ten goals. He won the Copa América in 1945, 1946 and 1947.|$|R
5|$|Basically, {{a lot of}} {{you know}} the {{political}} situation in my professional <b>career</b> <b>is</b> not positive. It's been really, really hard. I don't even know if this message is going to get to you because I don't know if they want you to hear this. I'm getting a lot of negative feedback from certain corporate people. But I am not willing to give up.|$|E
5|$|Berg's {{observation}} of {{local high school}} students while preparing to film the movie inspired his development {{of some of the}} characters. For example, Jason Street, the character whose promising football <b>career</b> <b>is</b> ended by a spinal injury in the pilot, was inspired by a local event. David Edwards, a football player from San Antonio’s Madison High, was paralyzed during a November 2003 game. Berg was at the game when this accident occurred; he was profoundly affected by Edwards' injury and how it overturned his life. Berg set up a similar incident in the pilot.|$|E
5|$|Donnchadh's <b>career</b> <b>is</b> {{not well}} {{documented}} in the surviving sources. Charters provide a little information about some of his activities, but overall their usefulness is limited; this is because no charter-collections (called cartularies) from the Gaelic south-west have survived the Middle Ages, and the only surviving charters relevant to Donnchadh's career come from the heavily Normanised English-speaking area to the east. Principally, the relevant charters record his acts of patronage towards religious houses, but incidental details mentioned {{in the body of}} these texts and the witness lists subscribed to them are useful for other matters.|$|E
50|$|Career {{coaching}} {{focuses on}} work and <b>career</b> and <b>is</b> similar to <b>career</b> counseling. <b>Career</b> coaching <b>is</b> {{not to be}} confused with life coaching, which concentrates on personal development. Another common term for a <b>career</b> coach <b>is</b> <b>career</b> guide.|$|R
50|$|Details of {{his later}} <b>career</b> <b>are</b> unclear.|$|R

5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Owsley retired to his farm in Danville, Kentucky, {{where he lived}} until {{the death of his}} wife in 1858. After this, he lived with his {{children}} until he died December 9, 1862. He is buried at Bellview Cemetery in Danville. Owsley County, Kentucky is named in his honor. Pleasant Retreat, his home in Garrard County during his early political <b>career,</b> <b>is</b> listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
5|$|Hitchcock refuses Hedren's {{request for}} {{time off to}} attend the Photoplay Awards in New York City (where she is {{nominated}} for the Most Promising Actress award), and tells her he will require her to make herself sexually available to him on demand if her <b>career</b> <b>is</b> to continue. Hedren quits working for Hitchcock after completing Marnie, but he refuses to release her from her contract; this prevents her from working for another production company, effectively ending her Hollywood career. Two notes before the titles inform the viewer that Hitchcock and Hedren never worked together again, and The Birds and Marnie are considered his last classic films.|$|E
5|$|If Curie's work helped {{overturn}} established {{ideas in}} physics and chemistry, {{it has had}} an equally profound effect in the societal sphere. To attain her scientific achievements, she had to overcome barriers, in both her native and her adoptive country, that were placed in her way {{because she was a}} woman. This aspect of her life and <b>career</b> <b>is</b> highlighted in Françoise Giroud's Marie Curie: A Life, which emphasizes Marie's role as a feminist precursor.|$|E

5|$|In , a 2010 {{documentary}} film narrated by Dustin Hoffman, Youkilis noted: It's something that I probably won’t realize until my <b>career</b> <b>is</b> over, {{how many people}} are really rooting for me and cheering for me. And it's not just because I went 3-for-4, or had a great game. It's just the fact that I represent a lot of Jewish people {{and a lot of the}} Jewish heritage, and the struggles that a lot of our people have had.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Welling co-starred in {{the all-star}} cast of Peter Landesman's {{historical}} drama Parkland, {{based on the book}} Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy by author Vincent Bugliosi. The story centers on the chaotic events that occurred at Parkland Hospital in Dallas, Texas on the day President John F. Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963. In 2014, Welling co-starred with Kevin Costner, Jennifer Garner, Frank Langella and Denis Leary in Ivan Reitman's sports drama Draft Day. He played a veteran quarterback whose <b>career</b> <b>is</b> at a crossroads.|$|E
5|$|Listeners {{unfamiliar}} with contemporary Christian music (CCM) often assume that Loder sings hymn-style music. Her <b>career</b> <b>is</b> unusual {{in that it}} began in CCM; most young musicians choose music genres such as country and pop, which are generally considered more likely to bring commercial success. Loder has asserted that she chose CCM because it gives purpose to her music; many of her songs are about God, but {{they may also be}} interpreted as being about other subjects.|$|E

5|$|Of this list's 40 {{pitchers}}, Valerio de los Santos and Robert Dodd {{share the}} best win–loss record by winning percentage; each won one game while losing none. Duggleby's 90 wins and 99 losses are most {{among the members}} of this list, as are his 445 strikeouts. Dave Downs' 2.74 earned run average (ERA) in the only season of his <b>career</b> <b>is</b> the best mark in that category. Red Donahue is one of the ten Phillies pitchers who have thrown a no-hitter, accomplishing the feat on July 8, 1898.|$|E
5|$|Paul {{has been}} married to Carol (Carolyn) Wells since 1957. They met in 1952 when Wells asked Paul to be her escort to her 16th {{birthday}} party. They have five children, who were baptized Episcopalian: Ronald, Lori, Randal, Robert, and Joy. Paul's son Randal is the junior United States senator {{from the state of}} Kentucky. Raised a Lutheran, Paul later became a Baptist. Since 1995, Carol Paul has published the Ron Paul Family Cookbook, a collection of recipes she and her friends contributed, and which was sold in part to support Ron Paul's political campaigns.

5|$|The protagonist {{and their}} friend, Eric Sparrow, live in {{suburban}} New Jersey and {{dream of becoming}} famous skateboarders. The protagonist manages to impress professional skater Chad Muska, visiting town for a demo, who gives them a new skateboard and informs them that {{a good way to}} start a skating <b>career</b> <b>is</b> to gain a sponsorship from a local skate shop. The protagonist seeks out Stacy Peralta, who agrees until he sees something to set them apart from the other local skaters, so the protagonist travels to Manhattan with Eric, who is on the run from drug dealers after setting their car on fire for stealing from the skate shop.|$|E

5|$|The {{theme of}} a young lawyer being fed up with a giant law firm and bolting away to a less lucrative but more {{satisfying}} <b>career</b> <b>is</b> shared with The Associate. The theme of a lawsuit against a giant corporation appeared in The Runaway Jury, but in the present book, the corporation is vindicated and proven to have been unjustly maligned (at least on the specific drug which {{is the subject of}} the lawsuit) and the mass tort lawyers are seen as greedy and unscrupulous, ultimately bolting and leaving the protagonist's tiny Chicago firm in the lurch.|$|E
5|$|West Arrow {{was built}} in 1918 for the USSB, {{as a part of}} the West boats, a series of steel-hulled cargo ships built on the West Coast of the United States for the World War I war effort. Information about her early <b>career</b> <b>is</b> largely absent, but by the 1920s, news reports {{revealed}} that the ship was sailing on the North Atlantic. By the mid-1920s, West Arrow was sailing for American Diamond on their cargo service to Rotterdam and Antwerp. In 1935, American Diamond changed the ship's name to Black Osprey and the ship continued in Rotterdam service.|$|E
5|$|Benedicte Wrensted (1859–1949) was {{a notable}} Danish female photographer, who {{emigrated to the}} USA in 1894. Wrensted learned her craft from her {{maternal}} aunt, Charlotte Borgen, {{and for a time}} in the 1880s operated a studio on Torvet 8, in Horsens, Denmark. Much of her photographic <b>career</b> <b>is</b> anchored to her studio in Pocatello, a small town in southeastern Idaho, where she took photographs of the local inhabitants and recorded the growth of the town. Perhaps her most famous work remains her documentary photographs of the Shoshone Great Basin Native Americans which are considered of great anthropological importance. Wrensted became a U.S. citizen in 1912, at age 53, and in the same year ended her career as a photographer. Many of her Native American images are preserved at the Smithsonian Institution and National Archives.|$|E
