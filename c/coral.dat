5|$|Approximately 60% of late-Cretaceous Scleractinia <b>coral</b> genera {{failed to}} cross the K–Pg {{boundary}} into the Paleocene. Further analysis of the <b>coral</b> extinctions shows that approximately 98% of colonial species, ones that inhabit warm, shallow tropical waters, became extinct. The solitary corals, which generally do not form reefs and inhabit colder and deeper (below the photic zone) areas of the ocean were less impacted by the K–Pg boundary. Colonial <b>coral</b> species rely upon symbiosis with photosynthetic algae, which collapsed due to the events surrounding the K–Pg boundary, however, the use of data from <b>coral</b> fossils to support K–Pg extinction and subsequent Paleocene recovery, must be weighed against the changes that occurred in <b>coral</b> ecosystems through the K–Pg boundary.|$|E

25|$|<b>Corals</b> are {{animals in}} the Phylum Cnidaria and the class Anthozoa. Anthozoa is broken down into two subclasses Octocorals (Alcyonaria) and Hexacorals (Zoantharia). Octocorals are soft <b>corals</b> such as sea pens. Hexacorals include sea anemones and hard bodied <b>corals.</b> Octocorals contain eight body {{extensions}} while Hexacorals have six.

In this system, both the milk snakes and the deadly <b>coral</b> snakes are mimics, whereas the false <b>coral</b> snakes are the model. It has also been suggested that this system could be an instance of pseudomimicry, the similar colour patterns having evolved independently in similar habitats.|$|E
5|$|The {{comparison}} of <b>coral</b> strontium/calcium minimums with sea surface temperature maximums, data recorded from , {{time can be}} correlated to <b>coral</b> strontium/calcium and δ18O variations. To confirm accuracy of the annual relationship between Sr/Ca and δ18O variations, a perceptible association to annual <b>coral</b> growth rings confirms the age conversion. Geochronology is established by the blending of Sr/Ca data, growth rings, and stable isotope data. El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) {{is directly related to}} climate fluctuations that influence <b>coral</b> δ18O ratio from local salinity variations associated with the position of the South Pacific convergence zone (SPCZ) and can be used for ENSO modeling.|$|E

5|$|The {{most popular}} kind of <b>coral</b> kept is soft <b>coral,</b> {{especially}} zoanthids and mushroom corals, which are especially {{easy to grow}} and propagate {{in a wide variety}} of conditions, because they originate in enclosed parts of reefs where water conditions vary and lighting may be less reliable and direct. More serious fishkeepers may keep small polyp stony <b>coral,</b> which is from open, brightly lit reef conditions and therefore much more demanding, while large polyp stony <b>coral</b> is a sort of compromise between the two.|$|E
5|$|Though <b>coral</b> {{have large}} sexually-reproducing populations, their {{evolution}} can be slowed by abundant asexual reproduction. Gene flow is variable among <b>coral</b> species.

5|$|Water {{temperature}} {{changes of}} more than 1–2°C (1.8–3.6°F) or salinity changes can kill some species of <b>coral.</b> Under such environmental stresses, corals expel their Symbiodinium; without them <b>coral</b> tissues reveal the white of their skeletons, an event known as <b>coral</b> bleaching.|$|E
5|$|While {{stalling}} {{over the}} western Caribbean Sea, Mitch's strong winds produced strong waves, damaging local <b>coral</b> reefs. Later, the storm's immense rainfall led to runoff polluted with debris and fresh water. This resulted in diseases occurring within the <b>coral.</b> However, the hurricane's upwelling cooled {{the warm water}} temperatures, preventing significant bleaching and destruction of the <b>coral</b> reef.|$|E
5|$|A major {{scientific}} {{controversy over}} the origin of <b>coral</b> reefs {{took place in the}} late 19th Century, between supporters of Darwin's theory (such as the American geologist James Dwight Dana, who early in his career had seen <b>coral</b> reefs in Hawaii and Fiji during the 1838–42 United States Exploring Expedition), and those who supported a rival theory put forward by the Scottish oceanographer John Murray, who participated in the 1872–76 Challenger expedition. Murray's theory challenged Darwin's notion of subsidence, proposing instead that <b>coral</b> reefs formed when accumulating mounds of calcareous marine sediments reached the shallow depths that could support the growth of corals. Amongst Murray's supporters was the independently wealthy American scientist Alexander Agassiz, who financed and undertook several expeditions to the Caribbean, Pacific and Indian Ocean regions to examine <b>coral</b> reefs in search of evidence to support Murray's theory, and to discredit Darwin.|$|E

5|$|Although {{not a true}} <b>coral,</b> Millepora alcicornis {{is subject}} to the same general threats that corals and <b>coral</b> reefs are facing. The {{greatest}} of these is global warming and the consequent rise in sea temperatures. Millepora alcicornis {{is one of the first}} corals to show bleaching as the symbiont zooxanthellae are killed. However, it is also more resilient than most and becomes re-established by recruitment earlier than the scleractinian corals. Other general threats to reefs include ocean acidification, pollution, sedimentation, invasive species and other changes in species dynamics, <b>coral</b> diseases, fisheries, leisure activities and tourism. Small quantities of Millepora alcicornis are gathered for sale to collectors.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>corals</b> first {{appeared}} in the Cambrian period, some , fossils are extremely rare until the Ordovician period, 100 million years later, when rugose and tabulate <b>corals</b> became widespread. Paleozoic <b>corals</b> often contained numerous endobiotic symbionts.|$|R

50|$|Not only {{fish and}} {{free-living}} organisms can ingest microplastics.

It was also noted that microplastics were present stuck to the exterior of the <b>corals</b> after exposure in the laboratory. The adherence to the outside of <b>corals</b> can potentially be harmful, because <b>corals</b> cannot handle sediment or any particulate matter on their exterior and slough it off by secreting mucus, and they expend a large amount of energy in the process, increasing the chances of mortality.|$|R
