50|$|Practically every {{household}} grows {{food for}} its own consumption on small plots. Maize, squashes, and beans are the staple crops whereas wheat, barley, potatoes, oats, and peas are also commonly grown. Tobacco and chilies are grown in the lowlands. The dibble stick and wooden plows drawn by oxen are adjuncts to farming. A dibble stick is a sharpened pole used to punch {{a hole in the}} plowed earth or a slashand-burn plot for planting seeds. One season for cultivating is available in the highlands compared to two in the hotter lowlands. Maize fields are cultivated separately from garden plots dedicated to the other vegetables. Old World fruit trees, introduced by the missionaries, are also tended near the settlements. In the highlands, there are small groves of fig, pomegranate, peach, and apple trees, and, in the hot canyon lands, there are orange and lemon trees. Gathering wild foods is still an important activity as well. Seasonal wild fruits, piñon nuts, walnuts, and edible species of acorns are collected, as is <b>crude</b> <b>honey.</b> Certain insects, reptiles, grubs, and the occasional rattlesnake round out the choices of consumable undomesticated resources. Hunting and trapping also supplement the diet, and deer and wild turkeys are the most highly prized game.|$|E
40|$|The medical {{property}} of honey in wound healing was reported {{due to its}} anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial activities. It is believed that polar compounds including sugars and polyphenols in honey could contribute to the biological activities. In this study, <b>crude</b> <b>honey</b> samples of Tualang, Gelam and Acacia were fractionated into polar fractions using a C 18 reversed-phase extraction column. The polar fractions {{were found to be}} more effective than <b>crude</b> <b>honey</b> samples because of lower effective concentration (0. 04 - 0. 37 g mL- 1) at 50 % of inhibition. However, the polar fractions did not improve the selectivity of inhibition against cyclooxygenase- 2. Polar fractionation also did not improve the anti-microbial activities of <b>crude</b> <b>honey</b> samples. The improvement was only showed by Tualang honey fraction (~ 70 %) with the minimum inhibitory concentration (3. 1 % (w/v)) against Candida albican.

40|$|Honey {{has been}} {{reported}} to have anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties, due to the presence of polyphenol and hydrogen peroxide, respectively. To our knowledge, the detail compounds that contribute to the activities are still unknown. Therefore, this study was focused on anti-microbial and the anti-inflammation activities of selected honey samples including Tualang, Acacia and Gelam honey from Malaysia. First, the honey samples were fractionated by acidified water (pH 2) in a solid phase extractor using C 18 column. Then, the honey fraction was assayed for anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory activities using well diffusion method and enzymatic cyclooxygenase (COX- 1 and - 2) assay, respectively. For antimicrobial study, four different microbial strains consisted of gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and gram negative (Salmonella typimurium) bacteria, yeast (Candida albican), as well as fungi (Fusarium oxysporum) were tested on the honey samples. The result showed that only Salmonella typimurium and Candida albican were inhibited by crude and acidified fraction of Tualang, Acacia and Gelam honey, but no inhibition was observed for Staphylococcus aureus and Fusarium oxysporum. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MICs) of the <b>crude</b> <b>honey</b> samples (50. 0 % w/v) and their fractions (12. 5 - 25. 0 % w/v) against Salmonella typimurium were about two to three times higher than the MICs of Manuka honey and its fraction (6. 3 - 12. 5 % w/v). However, the MICs of honey samples (3. 1 - 6. 3 % w/v for <b>crude</b> <b>honey</b> samples and 0. 8 - 3. 1 % w/v for their acidified fractions) against Candida albican appeared to be better, or at least comparable to Manuka honey samples (25. 0 % w/v for <b>crude</b> <b>honey</b> samples and 3. 1 % w/v for their acidified fractions). On the other hand, the anti-inflammatory activity of honey samples at 50 % of inhibition (IC 50) was found to be 0. 7 - 1. 7 mg/µL for COX- 1 and 0. 4 - 1. 3 mg/µL for COX- 2. Fractionation did not improve the anti-inflammatory activity of honey samples because their IC 50 values were increased to 320. 0 - 1080. 0 mg/L for COX- 1 and 280. 0 - 400. 0 mg/L for COX- 2. In term of selectivity ratio of COX- 1 /COX- 2, the <b>crude</b> <b>honey</b> samples of Gelam (ratio= 3. 3) and its fraction (ratio= 2. 7) appeared to be the most selective COX- 2 inhibitor, which was about two times higher than the selectivity of Manuka honey. The anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties of honey could be due to the presence of quercetin, chlorogenic acid, acacetin, apigenin- 7 -o-glucoside, myricetin and coumaryl quinic acid. These phenolic acids and flavonoids were detected in the honey fractio...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Keloid {{is a type}} of scar {{which extends}} beyond the {{boundaries}} of the original wound. It can spread to the surrounding skin by invasion. The use of Tualang honey is a possible approach for keloid treatment. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the antiproliferative effect of methanolic extraction of Tualang honey to primary human keloid fibroblasts and to identify the volatile compounds in methanol extraction of Tualang <b>honey.</b> Methods <b>Crude</b> Tualang <b>honey</b> was extracted with methanol and then dried using rota vapor to remove remaining methanol from honey. Normal and keloid fibroblasts were verified and treated with the extracted honey. Cell proliferation was tested with [3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yi) - 5 -(3 -carboxymethoxyphenyl) - 2 -(4 -sulfophenyl) - 2 H-tetrazolium, inner salt] (MTS) assay. Extraction of Tualang honey using methanol was carried out and the extracted samples were analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The result was analysed using SPSS and tested with Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. Results Methanolic extraction of honey has positive anti proliferative effect on keloid fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner. The presence of fatty acids such as palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid and octadecanoic acid may contribute to the anti-proliferative effect in keloid fibroblasts. Conclusions The methanolic honey extraction has an antiproliferative effect on keloid fibroblasts and a range of volatile compounds has been identified from Tualang honey. The antiproliferative effect of keloid fibroblasts towards Tualang honey may involve cell signaling pathway. Identifying other volatile compounds from different organic solvents should be carried out in future. </p...|$|R
40|$|Infection with Helicobacter pylori {{has been}} {{associated}} with the pathogenesis of numerous stomach and gastroduodenal diseases that pose threats to public health. Eradicaftion of this pathogen is a global challenge due to its alarming rate of multidrug resistance. Consequently, to find an alternative treatment, the search is increasingly focused on new antimicrobial product from natural sources including honey. Honey has been used as medicine in several cultures since ancient time due to its enormous biomedical activities. Its beneficial qualities have been endorsed to its antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory properties added to its phytocomponents. In this study, the anti-H. pylori activity of South African honeys and their solvent extracts as well as the phytochemicals present in the two most active honeys were evaluated. Agar well diffusion test was used to investigate the antimicrobial activity of six honey varieties obtained from different locations in the country. Subsequently, the honeys were extracted with four organic solvents viz n-hexane, diethyl ether, chloroform and ethyl acetate employed in order of increasing polarity. The antibacterial activity of the different solvent extracts of each honey was evaluated by agar well diffusion; broth micro dilution and time kill assays. Different chromatographic techniques (Thin layer & column chromatography) were employed to enumerate the phytochemical constituents in the most active solvent extracts of Pure Honey (PH) and Champagne Royal Train (CRT); and were identified by gas-chromatography linked mass-spectrometry. Linalool pure compound was equally evaluated for anti-H. pylori activity in a bid to trace the antibacterial agent among the variety of compounds identified. Data were analyzed by One-way ANOVA test at 95 % confidence interval. <b>Crude</b> <b>honeys</b> and their solvent extracts demonstrated potent anti-H. pylori activity with zone diameter that ranged from [16. 0 mm (crude) to 22. 2 mm (extract) ] and percentage susceptibilities of test isolates between 73. 3 % (crude) and 93. 3 % (extract). The chloroform extracts of PH and CRT were most active with MIC 50 in the ranges 0. 01 - viii 10 %v/v and 0. 625 - 10 %v/v respectively, not significantly different from amoxicillin (P> 0. 05); and efficient bactericidal activity (100 % bacterial cells killed) at 1 / 2 MIC and 4 xMIC over different time intervals, 36 - 72 hrs and 18 - 72 hrs respectively. The appearance of bands on the thin layer chromatography (TLC) chromatogram spotted with the chloroform extracts of PH and CRT; and developed with hexane: ethyl acetate: acetic acid (HEA) and methanol: acetic acid: water (MAAW) solvent systems indicated the presence of compounds. Purification of the compounds contained in these extracts over silica gel column yielded numerous fractions which were evaluated for antibacterial activity and purity. PHF 5 was the most active fraction with a mean MIC 50 value of 1. 25 mg/mL. Volatile compounds belonging to different known chemical families in honey were identified in all the active fractions obtained from PH. Conversely, only four compounds were identified in the active fractions obtained from CRT hence the non volatile constituents could be of prime relevance with respect to antibacterial activity of this honey. Of novelty was the presence of thiophene and N-methyl-D 3 -azirdine compounds, essential precursors used for the synthesis of natural products and pharmaceuticals with vital biomedical properties. Linalool demonstrated potent inhibitory (MIC 95, 0. 002 - 0. 0313 mg/mL) and bactericidal activity (0. 0039 - 0. 313 mg/mL) against the test isolates. On the other hand, a significant difference was recorded (P < 0. 05) in comparing the activity of linalool compound to the fractions. PH could serve as a good economic source of bioactive compounds which could be employed as template for the synthesis of novel anti-H. pylori drugs. However, further studies are needed to determine the non volatile active ingredients in PH and CRT as well as toxicological testin...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays many {{products}} {{are available to}} combat infections and thus to promote wound healing. Iodine {{is one of these}} products, but reports are conflicting as to the effectiveness and adverse effects of iodine in the treatment of wounds. A systematic review was performed of 27 randomised clinical trials, reporting on chronic, acute, burn wounds, pressure sores, and skin grafts. Main outcome parameters were wound healing, bacterial count, and adverse effects. Iodine did not lead to a reduction or prolongation of wound-healing time compared with other (antiseptic) wound dressings or agents. In individual trials, iodine was significantly superior to other antiseptic agents (such as silver sulfadiazine cream) and non-antiseptic dressings, but seemed inferior to a local antibiotic (Rifamycin SV MMX (R)) and, when combined with alcohol, to <b>crude</b> <b>honey</b> in reducing bacterial count and/or wound size. Adverse effects, including thyroid function derailment, did not occur more frequently with iodine. Based on the available evidence from clinical trials, iodine is an effective antiseptic agent that shows neither the purported harmful effects nor a delay of the wound-healing process, particularly in chronic and burn wounds. The antiseptic effect of iodine is not inferior to that of other (antiseptic) agents and does not impair wound healing. Hence, iodine deserves to retain its place among the modern antiseptic agents.
