25|$|A {{single shaft}} <b>combined</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>plant</b> {{comprises}} a gas turbine and a steam turbine driving a common generator. In a multi-shaft <b>combined</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>plant,</b> each gas turbine and each steam turbine {{has its own}} generator. The single shaft design provides slightly less initial cost and slightly better efficiency than if the gas and steam turbines had their own generators. The multi-shaft design enables two or more gas turbines to operate {{in conjunction with a}} single steam turbine, which can be more economical than a number of single shaft units.|$|E
25|$|An Integrated Solar Combined Cycle (ISCC) is {{a hybrid}} {{technology}} {{in which a}} solar thermal field is integrated within a <b>combined</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>plant.</b> In ISCC plants, solar energy is used as an auxiliary heat supply, supporting the steam cycle, which results in increased generation capacity or a reduction of fossil fuel use.|$|E

40|$|The {{urgency of}} this work is {{determined}} by the intensification of the role of steam-gas technologies (<b>combined</b> <b>cycle</b> technologies) in the field of power engineering in Russia and throughout the world. Developed mathematical model of ternary <b>combined</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>plants,</b> which is based on balance method includes system of mass balance and energy balance equations for ternary <b>combined</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>plants</b> and its units, equations of steam expansion in turbine and working fluids thermodynamic properties. On the basis of a model was carried out the analysis {{of the impact of the}} structure and thermodynamic parameters on thermal effectiveness of heat-recovery ternary <b>combined</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>plants</b> which <b>cycle</b> is the combination of three working substance cycles, one of which is low-boiling substance.

25|$|The McIntosh, Alabama CAES plant {{requires}} 2.5MJ {{of electricity}} and 1.2MJ lower heating value (LHV) of gas for each MJ of energy output, corresponding to an energy recovery efficiency of about 27%. A General Electric 7FA 2x1 <b>combined</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>plant,</b> {{one of the most}} efficient natural gas plants in operation, uses 1.85MJ (LHV) of gas per MJ generated, a 54% thermal efficiency.|$|E
25|$|By {{combining}} both gas {{and steam}} cycles, high input temperatures and low output temperatures can be achieved. The {{efficiency of the}} cycles add, because they are powered by the same fuel source. So, a <b>combined</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>plant</b> has a thermodynamic cycle that operates between the gas-turbine's high firing temperature and the waste heat temperature from the condensers of the steam cycle. This large range means that the Carnot efficiency of the cycle is high. The actual efficiency, while lower than this, is still {{higher than that of}} either plant on its own. The actual efficiency achievable is a complex area.|$|E
2500|$|Almost all coal, petroleum, nuclear, geothermal, {{solar thermal}} electric, and waste {{incineration}} plants, {{as well as}} many natural gas power stations are thermal. Natural gas is frequently combusted in gas turbines as well as boilers. [...] The waste heat from a gas turbine, in the form of hot exhaust gas, can be used to raise steam, by passing this gas through a Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) the steam is then used to drive a steam turbine in a <b>combined</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>plant</b> that improves overall efficiency. Power stations burning coal, fuel oil, or natural gas are often called fossil-fuel power stations. [...] Some biomass-fueled thermal power stations have appeared also. Non-nuclear thermal power stations, particularly fossil-fueled plants, which do not use co-generation are sometimes referred to as conventional power stations.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Combined</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>plants</b> {{have both}} a gas turbine fired by natural gas, and a steam boiler and steam turbine which use the {{hot exhaust gas}} from the gas turbine to produce electricity. This greatly {{increases}} the overall efficiency of the plant, and many new baseload power <b>plants</b> are <b>combined</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>plants</b> fired by natural gas.|$|R

2500|$|This was {{despite the}} fact that the merit order effect had been {{depressing}} electricity spot prices. [...] The merit order effect occurs when preferentially dispatched wind and photovoltaic generation displaces more expensive fossil fuel generation from the margin – often gas-fired <b>combined</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>plant</b> – thereby driving down the cleared price. [...] This effect is more pronounced for photovoltaics because their midday peak correlates with the maximum generation requirement on the system. [...] The merit order effect also lowers the revenues for conventional power plants and makes them less economically viable. [...] A 2007 study finds that [...] "in the case of the year 2006, the volume of the merit order effect exceeds the volume of the net support payments for renewable electricity generation which have to be paid by consumers". [...] A 2013 study estimates the merit order effect of both wind and photovoltaic electricity generation for the years 2008–2012: the combined merit order effect of wind and photovoltaics ranges from 0.5¢/kWh in 2010 to more than 1.1¢/kWh in 2012.|$|E
2500|$|The Dynegy power plant, {{previously}} {{owned by}} Pacific Gas and Electric Co.(PG), Duke Energy, and LSPower (PG), {{has played a}} large role in Morro Bay, and in providing electricity to the Central Coast and the Central Valley of California (primarily Fresno and Bakersfield). Due to its large tall smokestacks, it is sometimes referred to or known to locals as [...] "Three Fingers". The plant was built in the 1950s, and Dynegy had hoped to modernize it with a new <b>combined</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>plant.</b> The plant was operating at relatively low capacity factors (approximately 5%) under contract with PG, due primarily to economics. The plant was staffed with 44 employees. A portion of the city's budget came from taxes on the natural gas the plant burned. The outfall lease with the city was recently approved by the majority of the city council. Activists are opposed to the new plant. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the courts are wrestling with how to interpret the Clean Water Act (CWA) and its applicability to power plants. The EPA has ruled that the local Regional Water Quality Control Boards are responsible for ensuring that the current and the future plant are permitted and regulated.|$|E
