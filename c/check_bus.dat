Instead, the aluminum memory cards, also called twistor planes, had to be removed in groups of 128 so their permanent magnets could be written offline by a motorized writer, an improvement over the non motorized single card writer used in Project Nike.

A total of 5, 849 consecutive participants were sent a questionnaire to determine whether changes had been made in their lifestyles and if they had benefited from participation; 2, 361 (40. 4 %) responded. The campaign was rated highly at 8. 3 on a scale from 1 to 10. Respondents reported benefiting most from the personal examination results, in particular the measurement of bone density, examination of the carotid arteries and discussions with the staff. Of the respondents, 921 stated they changed their lifestyle in the area of physical activity (64. 4 %) and nutrition (63. 6 %). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed the variables predictive of responding were age, hierarchy, diet and smoking. Health promotion at work and the choice of offered examinations may influence the effects of health care promotion at the workplace and the readiness of participants to improve their attitudes to health. Health promotion at work is highly regarded by employees who pay more attention to diet, smoke less and in particular those over 50 yr of age.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{introduces}} the Cross-abstraction Real-time Analysis (CARTA) {{framework for the}} modelbased functional verification and performance estimation of chip multiprocessors (CMP) utilizing bus matrix (crossbar switch) interconnection networks. We argue that the inherent complexity in CMP designs requires the synergistic use of various models of computation to efficiently manage the trade-offs between accuracy and complexity. Our approach builds on domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) driving an open-source tool-chain that provides a cross-abstraction bridge between the finite state machine (FSM), discrete event (DE) and timed automata (TA) models of computation, and utilizes multiple model checkers to analyze formal properties at the cycle-accurate and transaction-level abstractions. The cross-abstraction analysis exploits accuracy for functional verification, and achieves significant speedups for performance estimation with marginal accuracy loss. We demonstrate results on an industrial strength networking CMP design utilizing a bus matrix interconnection network. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, the CARTA framework is the first model-based tool-chain that utilizes multiple abstractions and model checkers for the comprehensive and formal functional verification, performance estimation, and real-time verification of bus matrix based CMP designs.

40|$|PDW is a Microsoft Windows {{printer driver}} for the Raytheon TDU- 850 hardcopier. It {{provides}} a previously unavailable linkage between this printer and IBM PC compatibles running Microsoft Windows. This driver supports all {{the text and}} graphics features normally found in other laser printer drivers. The user can ensure true WYSIWYG (what {{you see is what}} you get) compatibility between the on-screen display of high-end application programs and the final hardcopy image because PDW supports the unique Microsoft Windows operating system requirement that printer drivers assist in the drawing of graphical objects on the video display as well as on the hardcopier. PDW can be called upon by the Windows Graphical Device Interface (GDI) to draw graphical objects (circles, lines, etc.) directly to the hardcopier or to render graphical objects to shared memory so that the objects can then be copied to the video screen by the screen driver. This allows Microsoft Windows, in conjunction with the screen driver, to provide maximum WYSIWYG fidelity while a document is being composed whenever PDW is selected. PDW can reside simultaneously on up to three separate PCs, each attached to a single Raytheon printer utilizing the printer's standard IEEE- 488 (GPIB) interface. PDW contains special software to <b>check</b> for <b>bus</b> contention before attempting to access the printer. PDW is written in C-language for IBM PC series and compatible computers running MS-DOS v 4. 0 or later and Microsoft Windows v 3. 0 or later. It requires 8 Mb of RAM for execution.
