25|$|The noblesse de robe existed by longstanding tradition. In 1600 {{it gained}} legal status. High {{positions}} in regional parlements, tax boards (<b>chambres</b> des comptes), {{and other important}} financial and official state offices (usually bought at high price) conferred nobility, generally in two generations, although membership in the Parlements of Paris, Dauphiné, Besançon and Flanders, {{as well as on}} the tax boards of Paris, Dole and Grenoble elevated an official to nobility in one generation.|$|E

These [...] called valet de <b>chambres,</b> grooms or pages, ranking {{from top to bottom}} in that order [...] were most often young boys, although in the larger royal courts the valet de <b>chambres</b> included both young noble courtiers, and often artists, musicians and other specialists who might be of international repute. Assigning these the office of valet was a way of regularising their position within the household.|$|E

60|$|Two {{minutes later}} he was amongst his friends. He heaved a great sigh of content and relief. The very {{atmosphere}} here seemed to be different. As far as the lodging itself was concerned, it was as bare, as devoid of comfort as those sort of places--so-called <b>chambres</b> garnies--usually were in these days. The chairs looked rickety and uninviting, the sofa was of black horsehair, the carpet was threadbare, and in places in actual holes; {{but there was a}} certain something in the air which revealed, {{in the midst of all}} this squalor, the presence of a man of fastidious taste.|$|E
60|$|Now, mon cher, do {{you think}} you can, without inconvenience, engage me for a week an apartment--cheerful, light, and wholesome--containing a {{comfortable}} salon et deux <b>chambres</b> à coucher. I do not care whether it is an hotel or not, but the reason why I do not write for an apartment to the Hôtel Brighton is, that there they expect one to dine at home (I mean in the apartment) generally; whereas, as we are coming to Paris expressly to be always looking about us, we want to dine wherever we like every day. Consequently, what we want to find is a good apartment, where we can have our breakfast but where we shall never dine.|$|E
60|$|My uncle Ro {{was fond}} of Paris, and he had {{actually}} become {{the owner of a}} small hotel in the faubourg, in which he retained a handsome furnished apartment for his own use. The remainder of the house was let to permanent tenants; but the whole of the first floor, and of the entresol, remained in his hands. As a special favor, he would allow some American family to occupy even his own apartment--or rather appartement, for the words are not exactly synonymous--when he intended to be absent for a term exceeding six months, using the money thus obtained in keeping the furniture in repair, and his handsome suite of rooms, including a salon, salle à manger, antichambre cabinet, several <b>chambres</b> à coucher, and a boudoir--yes, a male boudoir! for so he affected to call it--in a condition to please even his fastidiousness.|$|E

6000|$|After {{receiving}} and acknowledging these politenesses, the French captain {{takes his}} charge on board, {{and the first}} thing we afterwards hear of him is the determination [...] "qu'il a su faire passer" [...] into all his crew, to sink rather than yield up the body of the Emperor aux mains de l'etranger--into the hands of the foreigner. My dear Monseigneur, is not this par trop fort? Suppose [...] "the foreigner" [...] had wanted the coffin, could he not have kept it? Why show this uncalled-for valor, this extraordinary alacrity at sinking? Sink or blow yourself up as much as you please, but your Royal Highness must see that the genteel thing would have been to wait until you were asked to do so, before you offended good-natured, honest people, who--heaven help them!--have never shown themselves at all murderously inclined towards you. A man knocks up his cabins forsooth, throws his tables and chairs overboard, runs guns into the portholes, and calls le quartier du bord ou existaient ces <b>chambres,</b> Lacedaemon. Lacedaemon! There is a province, O Prince, in your royal father's dominions, a fruitful parent of heroes in its time, which would have given a much better nickname to your quartier du bord: you should have called it Gascony.|$|E
6000|$|I often amuse {{myself by}} {{watching}} from my window (which, by the bye, is tolerably elevated) {{the movements of}} the teeming little world below me; and as I am on sociable terms with the porter and his wife, I gather from them, as they light my fire, or serve my breakfast, anecdotes of all my fellow lodgers. I have been somewhat curious in studying a little antique Frenchman, who occupies one of the jolie <b>chambres</b> à garçon already mentioned. He is one of those superannuated veterans who flourished before the revolution, and have weathered all the storms of Paris, in consequence, very probably, of being fortunately too insignificant to attract attention. He has a small income, which he manages with the skill of a French economist; appropriating so much for his lodgings, so much for his meals; so much for his visits to St. Cloud and Versailles, and so much for his seat at the theater. He has resided in the hotel for years, and always in the same chamber, which he furnishes at his own expense. The decorations of the room mark his various ages. There are some gallant pictures which he hung up in his younger days; with a portrait of a lady of rank, whom he speaks tenderly of, dressed in the old French taste; and a pretty opera dancer, pirouetting in a hoop petticoat, who lately died at a good old age. In a corner of this picture is stuck a prescription for rheumatism, and below it stands an easy-chair. He has a small parrot at the window, to amuse him when within doors, and a pug dog to accompany him in his daily peregrinations. While I am writing he is crossing the court to go out. He is attired in his best coat, of sky-blue, and is doubtless bound for the Tuileries. His hair is dressed in the old style, with powdered ear-locks and a pig-tail. His little dog trips after him, sometimes on four legs, sometimes on three, and looking as if his leather small-clothes were too tight for him. Now the old gentleman stops to have a word with an old crony who lives in the entre-sol, and is just returning from his promenade. Now they take a pinch of snuff together; now they pull out huge red cotton handkerchiefs (those [...] "flags of abomination," [...] as they have well been called) and blow their noses most sonorously. Now they turn to make remarks upon their two little dogs, who are exchanging the morning's salutation; now they part, and my old gentleman stops to have a passing word with the porter's wife; and now he sallies forth, and is fairly launched upon the town for the day.|$|E
