5|$|Sunset Overdrive is an action-adventure game {{set in a}} third-person perspective. Players {{navigate}} a metropolis called Sunset City in {{the year}} 2027. This dystopian world has been overrun by mutants called the OD, short for Overcharge Drinkers. The player character is a former FizzCo employee, tasked with <b>cleaning</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> mess left behind from a party FizzCo had thrown to celebrate the launch of its new energy drink, Overcharge Delirium XT.|$|E
5|$|The book {{describes}} the explosion on April 19, 1989, and the heroic {{efforts by the}} ship's crew to contain the fires and avoid a cataclysmic detonation of the turret's powder magazines. After the fires were contained, Moosally ordered the crew to immediately begin <b>cleaning</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> turret. The cleanup involved removing {{the bodies of the}} deceased turret crewman and disposing of the damaged turret equipment, all without photographing or otherwise recording the locations of the bodies or equipment which would have presumably assisted with the resulting investigation.|$|E
5|$|Annually, Manila is {{hit with}} 5 to 7 typhoons {{creating}} floods. In 2009, Typhoon Ketsana (Ondoy) struck the Philippines. In its aftermath, {{the lack of}} infrastructure led {{to one of the}} worst floodings in the Philippines and creating a significant amount of pollution. Following the aftermath of Typhoon Ketsana, the city began to dredge its rivers and improve its drainage network. The Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission is in charge of <b>cleaning</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Pasig River and tributaries for transportation, recreation and tourism purposes. Rehabilitation efforts have resulted in the creation of parks along the riverside, along with stricter pollution controls.|$|E

5|$|Olivia {{is one of}} {{only three}} major hurricanes on record to strike Mazatlán, the others being the 1943 hurricane, as well as another in 1957; in {{addition}} Hurricane Tico in 1983 came close to striking the city. Reconstruction began immediately, and the Secretariat of National Defense quickly deployed food and water to the storm victims. By a day after the storm's passage, the Mexican Navy sent two ships worth of relief supplies to Mazatlán, including water, medicine, and rescue equipment. Three days after the storm passed through the region, relief workers began <b>cleaning</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> storm debris.|$|E
5|$|Two earlier {{business}} decisions by the Chicago Sun-Times led to substantial savings {{of time and}} money during the Trump Tower's construction. The original 1950s sea wall was built by the newspaper company to bomb-shelter thickness, to withstand a Cold War attack, and thus {{did not have to be}} broken down and rebuilt. Furthermore, the company decided in the 1970s to switch from petroleum-based to soy-based ink, which reduced ground pollution from the printing plant. This considerably reduced the costs and time for <b>cleaning</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> site prior to building anew.|$|E
5|$|Worcestershire {{elected to}} bat first, and Johnson took 3/52 from 23 overs, the most bowled by any Australian, <b>cleaning</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> lower order as Australia removed the hosts for 233. When Australia batted, Johnson {{came in at}} No. 10 and made an unbeaten 12 as Australia {{declared}} their innings closed at 8/462. Australia dismissed the hosts for 212 to complete victory by an innings and 17 runs. Johnson took the last three wickets to end with 3/75 from 13.3 overs; {{he was the most}} uneconomical bowler among those who sent down more than 18 deliveries.|$|E

5|$|Curing {{the leaks}} and <b>cleaning</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{contamination}} delayed the tunnel's completion by a year, {{and it was}} finally opened on 22 August 1999. The entire process was further complicated by conflicts between NSB Gardermobanen and the Scandinavian Rock Group. Retrospective surveys showed a lack of control and reporting procedures during the incidents, which should have been addressed in 1995, but were never taken seriously. Compensation was paid for approximately 60 houses which were damaged {{as a result of}} tunnel construction. An evaluation by the Ministry of Transport and Communications showed that NOK500 million was spent fixing the leaks, but the report claimed that this was to a large extent a waste of money, resulting from inefficient engineering procedures. The same report criticized the planning and organization of the construction of the entire railway. In total the extraordinary additional costs for the tunnel totaled NOK1.3 billion.|$|E
5|$|The {{substance}} Rhoca-Gil {{was used}} to fix the leakages, but the substance failed to work properly. Not only did it fail to polymerize and stop the leaks, it also contaminated the surroundings with acrylamide. The entire process of fixing the leak and <b>cleaning</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> toxicity delayed {{the process of building}} the tunnel by one year; and it was first opened on 22 August 1999. Further complications arose due to conflicts between NSB Gardermobanen and the construction company. Retrospective surveys showed a lack of control and reporting procedures during incidents that should have been addressed in 1995, and were never taken seriously. About sixty houses received damage due to the construction of the tunnel. An evaluation performed by the Ministry of Transport and Communications showed that NOK500 million was used on fixing the leaks; however, the report claimed this was, to a large extent, a waste of money due to inefficient engineering procedures. The same report criticized the planning and organization of the entire construction of the railway.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Jason Wade in the driver's {{seat of a}} car, with {{the other members of}} Lifehouse in the car with him. The traffic is at a stand still in a tunnel, as a swarm of people have {{abandoned}} their vehicles and are walking through. Wade and the band members get out of the car, and begin walking in the opposite direction of the crowd {{to the other side of}} the tunnel. Wade pushes through the people, who are in a rush to get to the entrance of the tunnel and is constantly focused on his destination to get to the end. When he reaches the tunnel's end, he sees the wreckage of a car crash with firefighters and paramedics <b>cleaning</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> mess. Wade then sees a girl observing what appears to be herself, dead inside one of the crashed car. He then looks to the left, and sees an old man observing himself, dead on the ground. As Wade looks into the other car, he sees himself, also seemingly dead. Upon this, Wade frantically runs back into the tunnel towards his car. Then he sees himself in the car with the band members, however everyone seems to be frozen as he bangs on the windows. Suddenly Wade is inside the car again, and a police officer comes to the window, motioning him to continue driving, since he is stopped in the middle of the tunnel for no apparent reason.|$|E

5|$|In the Second Test at Sydney, Johnston took 3/56 and 3/70 in a low-scoring match, {{removing}} Hutton in both innings. He {{had another}} notable innings {{when he joined}} Neil Harvey with 78 runs needed for victory on a difficult batting surface against the hostile pace of Frank Tyson and Brian Statham. In particular, Tyson was bowling with a strong tailwind and a slips cordon standing around 40 yards behind the bat. They put together a stubborn 39 run tenth-wicket partnership in 40 minutes, which gave Australia hope of an unlikely victory with Harvey still attacking. Harvey felt that Tyson was almost out of energy after a spell of extreme pace, and that the remaining bowlers were not beyond Johnston. However, a Tyson ball that was aimed at the ribcage saw Johnston fend at the ball; he was caught behind for 11, giving England a dramatic victory. After taking 1/26 in the first innings, Johnston took 5/85 in the second innings of his last Test performance {{in front of his}} home crowd at the MCG, with some tight spin on a dry surface. He removed Edrich for 13 and Peter May for 91 before <b>cleaning</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> tail with three quick wickets. This left Australia 240 to win but there was to be no fairytale as England won by 128 runs. Johnston then took match figures of 4/80 in the Fourth Test at Adelaide, in what was to be the his last Test on Australian soil. Australia lost the match and England retained the Ashes; it was Australia's third consecutive Test defeat, the first time they had suffered a hat-trick of defeats since the infamous Bodyline series of 1932–33. Johnston had less success outside the Tests, which were played on bowler-friendly surfaces. He managed only 13 wickets at 30.38 in five matches.|$|E
