40|$|As the US {{power systems}} {{continue}} to increase in size and complexity, including the growth of smart grids, larger blackouts due to <b>cascading</b> outages become more likely.

Such a collapse is characterized by a self-sustaining sequence of line outages followed by a topology breakup of the network. This paper addresses the implementation and testing of a process for N-k contingency analysis and sequential <b>cascading</b> outage simulation in order to identify potential <b>cascading</b> modes. A modeling approach described in this paper offers a unique capability to identify initiating events that may lead to <b>cascading</b> outages. It predicts the development of <b>cascading</b> events by identifying and visualizing potential <b>cascading</b> tiers. The proposed approach was implemented using a 328 -bus simplified SERC power system network. The results of the study indicate that initiating events and possible <b>cascading</b> chains may be identified, ranked and visualized.
