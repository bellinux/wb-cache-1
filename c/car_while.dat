5|$|Not {{long after}} the release of Third/Sister Lovers, Bell died in a car accident. He {{apparently}} lost control of his <b>car</b> <b>while</b> driving alone and was killed when he struck a lamp post after hitting the curb a hundred feet before. A blood test found that he was not drunk at the time, and no drugs were found on him other than a bottle of vitamins. Bell is believed to have either fallen asleep at the wheel or become distracted.|$|E
5|$|Several cars {{suffered}} issues {{during the}} second safety car period. Nicki Thiim brought the No. 95 Aston Martin from the LMGTE Pro lead straight to the team's garage with a leaking power steering system, handing the class lead to its sister No. 99 Aston Martin. Christian Ried in the No. 88 Proton Porsche suffered an engine fire in the second Mulsanne Straight chicane, extending the safety car period as it was tended to. KCMG retained their LMP2 class lead ahead of the TDS Racing <b>car</b> <b>while</b> behind the safety <b>car,</b> <b>while</b> the sole Corvette, No. 71 AF Corse Ferrari, and two circulating Aston Martin vehicles were nose to tail in LMGTE Pro, continuing their battle after the safety car period ended. Oliver Gavin's Corvette eventually {{pulled away from the}} rest of the LMGTE Pro field. The Riley Viper relinquished its lead in LMGTE Am to the No. 98 Aston Martin of Paul Dalla Lana and the SMP Ferrari driven by François Perrodo. As the safety car period ended the No. 17 Porsche of Hartley held the race lead, but Albuquerque was in pursuit in the No. 9 Audi, breaking the Le Mans lap record with a time of three minutes and 17.647 seconds. The No. 9 Audi was able to mount a better challenge to the leading Porsche, and René Rast was able to take the race lead after pit stops.|$|E
5|$|Smith's third {{victim was}} Carol Jordan, a 39-year-old care home worker {{and mother of}} six from Balsall Heath, who was killed as she walked to work.

5|$|The two Ferrari {{cars and}} the Renault of Kubica became the first cars to queue up behind the safety <b>car,</b> <b>while</b> {{the rest of the}} field had enough notice to divert to the pitlane for their first stop. The {{significance}} of these events was that both Vettel and Hamilton were able to make their first stops before their advantage over {{the rest of the field}} was cancelled out by catching the safety <b>car,</b> <b>while</b> Alonso, Massa and Kubica fell down the order. Hamilton's stop was for a replacement front wing. The safety car drove into the pit lane at the end of lap 14 and the cars were allowed to overtake. Vettel locked his tyres and ran deep driving into the final turn, and resisted Hamilton's attempt at overtaking him. Alonso immediately pushed hard and passed Hülkenberg for ninth place at turn 17 on the 15th lap. A line of cars formed behind Kobayashi while Vettel and Hamilton pulled away from the rest of the field, as the front two began trading the fastest lap time of the event. Button gained a large amount of top speed but remained behind both Sauber cars. Schumacher passed both Virgin cars to move into the 17th position by lap 17.|$|E
5|$|Black {{and several}} former colleagues of his from the Federal Bureau of Investigation decide to taunt the killer into coming forward, giving {{a press release}} {{describing}} him as cowardly. A furious Dion calls the police to rebut this, betraying his identity. Police arrive at his home to arrest him, finding him sitting, covered in blood, {{on the kitchen floor}} beside his mother's body. He is apprehended, clearing Malcom Hunziger of wrongdoing. Black and his family return home to Seattle. Black carries his daughter from the airport to their <b>car,</b> <b>while</b> Catherine waits to collect their luggage. The man who had helped Dion stands to one side, watching the family. As Black returns to help Catherine with the suitcases, she has disappeared, leaving behind only an origami dove given to her by her mother.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{disapproval of}} the union, Venizelos allowed Aspasia {{and her mother}} {{to move into the}} Royal Palace on {{condition}} that the marriage remain secret. The information leaked, however, and to escape public opprobrium Aspasia was forced to leave Greece. She fled to Rome, and then to Paris, where Alexander was allowed to join her, six months later, on condition that they did not attend official functions together. On their Parisian honeymoon, while motoring near Fontainebleau, the couple witnessed a serious car crash in which Count Kergariou's chauffeur lost control of his master's vehicle. Alexander avoided the count's car, which swerved and hit a tree. The king drove the injured to hospital in his own <b>car,</b> <b>while</b> Aspasia, who had trained as a nurse during World War I, rendered first aid. The count was seriously injured and died shortly afterward, after having both legs amputated.|$|E

5|$|In second practice, Hamilton {{was again}} quickest {{but was also}} caught out again. He went off at the turn ten hairpin and crashed his <b>car</b> <b>while</b> {{he was doing a}} run on {{intermediate}} tyres in wet conditions– a downpour of rain affected {{the second half of the}} session. Most teams sent their drivers out only in the dry first half, setting times on the super-soft tyre compound. Ferrari looked to be significantly closer to Mercedes, with Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen finishing second and third respectively, less than 0.4 seconds behind Hamilton. Lotus confirmed their good pace from the first session when Pastor Maldonado was fifth fastest, behind Rosberg.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all other}} US states, New Jersey sets a 0.08 percent {{weight by volume}} blood alcohol content (BAC) as the {{threshold}} for intoxication when operating a motor vehicle (e.g. automobile, boat). It is possible {{to be charged with}} driving under the influence (DUI) with a BAC level below 0.08%, but there is a presumption in that situation that the driver is not intoxicated. State law prohibits those under 21 from driving if their BAC is 0.01% or more, prohibits the operation of a commercial vehicle with a BAC of 0.04% or more, and mandates that drivers submit a breath sample if requested by a police officer. To be convicted of DUI in New Jersey, a person must be operating or attempting to operate a motorized vehicle; thus activities such as sleeping in a <b>car</b> <b>while</b> intoxicated or bicycling while drunk are not illegal.|$|E

5|$|On August 5, 2007, {{during the}} Firestone Indy 400, Foyt was {{involved}} in a spectacular seven-car crash in which Dario Franchitti's car was sent airborne and then came down on Foyt's <b>car.</b> <b>While</b> Foyt was uninjured, Franchitti's car left visible tire marks on Foyt's helmet. Foyt's crew was able to repair the car and get him back on the track where he completed enough laps to secure an 8th-place finish. The following week at the Meijer Indy 300, Foyt's crew gave him great pit stops which allowed him to take to lead with 10 laps remaining. Even though Foyt was passed a few laps later by Tony Kanaan and Scott Dixon, he managed to hold {{on the rest of the}} way and drive to a career-best 3rd-place finish, the first Top-5 finish of his career. It was also the best finish in Vision Racing's team history, tying Tomas Scheckter's 3rd-place finish at the Milwaukee Mile in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Players can utilize Kinect to {{look into}} a corner using a new head {{tracking}} feature. This allows them to look toward the apex of a corner or at nearby cars. The controller or steering wheel is used to control the <b>car</b> <b>while</b> Kinect is used independently for viewing around the driver. Players can also use Kinect as a game controller. In this setting the game automatically accelerates and decelerates the player's vehicle utilizing {{a modified version of}} the feature known as Auto Brake in Forza Motorsport 3. The steering is controlled by placing the players arms out as if controlling an invisible steering wheel. Kinect will allow the player to use voice commands to start races and navigate menus.|$|E
5|$|Strong {{winds were}} also {{reported}} in New England. The highest winds associated with Daisy were felt over coastal Maine, where winds of 70mph (115km/h) were commonly reported. Wind damage was severe and widespread; {{one person in}} Maine was killed when a fallen tree landed on, and crushed his <b>car</b> <b>while</b> he was in it. In the southeastern portion of the state, power outages were reported, due to fallen trees and tree limbs. In addition, some roof shingles blown off in Maine and Massachusetts, while other houses were completely unroofed. Daisy caused moderate to severe damage in eastern New England. Total wind damage in New England was estimated to have reached $500,000.|$|E

5|$|The car {{scene with}} Gillian Anderson and Annabeth Gish {{was shot at}} Kanan Road, Malibu. Anderson and Gish sat in {{what is known as}} an insert <b>car,</b> <b>while</b> the crew sat in a pickup car in front of them. The birth scene was filmed at the old Paramount Movie Ranch. According to {{director}} Kim Manners, the most difficult scene to shoot was in the elevator with Mitch Pileggi and Nicholas Lea. Gish had never worked much with guns before joining The X-Files cast, so the producers got a retired LAPD officer to teach her more about firearms. She did some shooting practices before returning to the set. The FBI garage scenes were shot in Century City and took a total of four days to finish.|$|E
