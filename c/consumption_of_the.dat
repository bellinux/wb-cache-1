The coconut crab is eaten by Southeast Asians and Pacific Islanders and is considered a delicacy and an aphrodisiac, and intensive hunting has threatened the species' survival in some areas. While the coconut crab itself is not innately poisonous, it may become so depending on its diet, and cases of coconut crab poisoning have occurred.

30|$|<b>The</b> overall energy <b>consumptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{protocols}} {{are shown}} in Table 3. <b>The</b> energy <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> TTDD is higher than HexDD and LBDD, since as the sink moves, it tends to reconstruct a new path to a dissemination node on the grid by local query flooding and agent updates.

5|$|As {{with all}} members of its genus, C.cinnabarinum is {{generally}} considered inedible by field guides. Because the fruit bodies begin development underground, they are too tough for consumption {{by the time they}} are visible, and their appearance may be considered unappetizing. A study of the cultural practices of mestizo descendants of the Otomi people in Tenango de Doria, Mexico, reported that immature specimens of C.cinnabarinum, known locally as yemitas, were frequently eaten raw in the past, especially by children. <b>Consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> species was no longer commonplace, with only five of the 450 locals interviewed familiar with the practice. The gleba of C.cinnabarinum has been described as having a mild taste and, despite a local recollection to the contrary, is not sweet. C.cinnabarinum has also been used in traditional medicine. A 1986 ethnomycological study of native traditions in Veracruz identified this use of huang noono, which locals roasted, then consumed as a powder with mineral water to treat gastrointestinal distress. Unlike these Mexican traditions, Hunan folk beliefs hold that the mushroom is poisonous on account of its bright color.|$|E

5|$|Brain tissue consumes a {{large amount}} of energy in {{proportion}} to its volume, so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals. The need to limit body weight in order, for example, to fly, has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species, such as bats. Most of the brain's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge (membrane potential) of neurons. Most vertebrate species devote between 2% and 8% of basal metabolism to the brain. In primates, however, the percentage is much higher—in humans it rises to 20–25%. The energy <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain does not vary greatly over time, but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET, fMRI, and NIRS. The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen-dependent metabolism of glucose (i.e., blood sugar), but ketones provide a major alternative source, together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids (caprylic and heptanoic acids), lactate, acetate, and possibly amino acids.|$|E
5|$|Caddisfly larvae can {{be found}} in all feeding guilds in {{freshwater}} habitats. Most early stage larvae and some late stage ones are collector-gatherers, picking up fragments of organic matter from the benthos. Other species are collector-filterers, sieving organic particles from the water using silken nets, or hairs on their legs. Some species are scrapers, feeding on the film of algae and other periphyton that grows on underwater objects in sunlight. Others are shredder-herbivores, chewing fragments off living plant material while others are shredder-detritivores, gnawing at rotting wood or chewing dead leaves that have been pre-processed by bacteria and fungi; most of the nutrients of the latter group come from <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bacteria and fungi. The predatory species either actively hunt their prey, typically other insects, tiny crustaceans and worms, or lie in wait for unwary invertebrates to come too close. A few species feed opportunistically on dead animals or fish, and some Leptoceridae larvae feed on freshwater sponges.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases of}} self <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solar energy, the payback time is {{calculated}} {{based on how}} much electricity is not purchased from the grid. For example, in Germany, with electricity prices of 0.25 €/kWh and insolation of 900 kWh/kW, one kWp will save €225 per year, and with an installation cost of 1700 €/KWp the system cost will be returned in less than seven years. However, in many cases, the patterns of generation and consumption do not coincide, and {{some or all of the}} energy is fed back into the grid. The electricity is sold, and at other times when energy is taken from the grid, electricity is bought. The relative costs and prices obtained affect the economics. In many markets, the price paid for sold PV electricity is significantly lower than the price of bought electricity, which incentivizes self consumption. Moreover, separate self consumption incentives have been used in e.g. Germany and Italy. Grid interaction regulation has also included limitations of grid feed-in in some regions in Germany with high amounts of installed PV capacity. By increasing self consumption, the grid feed-in can be limited without curtailment, which wastes electricity.|$|E
