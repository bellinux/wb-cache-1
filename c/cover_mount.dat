25|$|Geologists {{conclude}} that {{no evidence for}} such a flood is observed in the preserved rock layers and moreover that such a flood is physically impossible, given the current layout of land masses. For instance, since Mount Everest currently is approximately 8.8 kilometres in elevation and the Earth's surface area is 510,065,600km2, the volume of water required to <b>cover</b> <b>Mount</b> Everest {{to a depth of}} 15 cubits (6.8 m), as indicated by Genesis 7:20, would be 4.6 billion cubic kilometres. Measurements of the amount of precipitable water vapor in the atmosphere have yielded results indicating that condensing all water vapor in a column of atmosphere would produce liquid water with a depth ranging between zero and approximately 70mm, depending on the date and the location of the column. Nevertheless, there continue to be many adherents to flood geology, and in recent years new theories have been introduced such as catastrophic plate tectonics and catastrophic orogeny.|$|E
500|$|The fourth {{phase of}} {{activity}} began one {{million years ago}} when the Cordilleran Ice Sheet retreated from the upper flanks of the adjacent lava plateau, creating Mount Edziza proper which is the most northerly of the four central volcanoes. It is a steep-sided stratovolcano and the largest and highest of the peaks that form the volcanic complex with an elevation of , overlapping the northern flank of Ice Peak. The stratovolcano is made up of a fine-grained volcanic rock called trachyte and is associated with several lava domes which were formed by trachyte lava flows and explosive eruptions. Its smooth northern and western flanks, only slightly channeled by erosion, curve up to a circular [...] summit ridge which surrounds a central, ice-filled caldera [...] in diameter. Many glaciers <b>cover</b> <b>Mount</b> Edziza proper, including the Tencho Glacier on its southern flank. Active cirques on the eastern flank have breached the caldera rim, exposing the remnants of numerous lava lakes which ponded in the caldera 900,000 years ago and rest on hydrothermally altered breccia of the main conduit. Piles of pillow lava and hyaloclastite, formed by subglacial eruptions, are found on the flanks of Mount Edziza and nearby Ice Peak, {{as well as on the}} surface of the surrounding shield volcano. Pillow Ridge on Edziza's northwest flank was formed when basaltic lava erupted beneath the regional Cordilleran Ice Sheet when it was close to its greatest thickness.|$|E

5000|$|Dominion was a British {{band from}} Thornhill, Dewsbury, that played {{a mix of}} death metal and doom metal genres.

In 2006 their former record label Peaceville decided to release an 18 track compilation album entitled Threshold A Retrospective. This featured songs from the albums Interface and Blackout, in addition to songs that were earlier released on the Under the Sign of the Sacred Star Peaceville compilation album. A version of the Tears For Fears song [...] "Shout", originally released on the Peaceville X album, has now gone on to be a classic in metal clubs across the UK. This 2006 release got great reviews in the press, and saw Dominion getting a KKKK (out of a possible 5K's) review in Kerrang! magazine, hailing the band as [...] "Brit Metal Pioneers and a criminally overlooked band".
