A gamma Gaussian inverse Wishart mixture implementation, which is capable of estimating the target extents and measurement rates {{as well as the}} kinematic state of the target, is proposed, and it is compared to its PHD counterpart in a simulation study. The results clearly show that the CPHD filter has a more robust cardinality estimate leading to smaller OSPA errors, which confirms that the extended target CPHD filter inherits the properties of its point target <b>counterpart.</b> <b>Funding</b> Agencies|Swedish Research Council under the Linnaeus Center (CADICS) ||Swedish Research Council| 621 - 2010 - 4301 |Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research|| CADICSCUA...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} {{economic}} and political context, significant changes are taking place in food security issues. Nowadays, emphasis is being placed on developing seamless and sensible links between various food security programmes, including emergency aid and overall development policies. In 1996, the European Union adopted a new community programme with flexible, trans-sectoral tools designed to: ? improve market supply through support to local food production (local purchases, and so-called triangular operations); ? facilitate the access of vulnerable groups to basic food supply, instead of simply providing food; ? create a stable and responsive political and economic climate to encourage long-term food security policies. Between October and December 1997, CTA and the Food Aid and Food Security Unit of the Directorate-General for Development of the European Commission organised {{a series of three}} seminars based on this new set of measures. This was done against a background of alarming perspectives, especially with regard to sub-Saharan Africa. The seminars were intended to inform and encourage discussion about the measures with ACP decision-makers (Permanent Secretary level of Ministries of Agriculture, Economic Affairs and Trade) and with representatives of NGOs and regional organisations, all of whom were actively involved in this domain. The four regions of Africa, and the Caribbean, were represented *. Each participant approached the seminars with their own particular experience and vision, and together discussed various sections of the new measures and their tools, such as aid in kind, financial aid, <b>counterpart</b> <b>funding</b> and foreign exchange arrangements. A set of case studies underlined just how diverse (e. g. countries in a critical state, in the process of rehabilitation, and {{with a high level of}} food insecurity) and complex situations of food insecurity are, as well as the difficulties of implementing corrective steps.

40|$|Advanced Composite Products and Technology, Inc. (ACPT) has {{developed}} composite drill pipe (CDP) {{that matches the}} structural and strength properties of steel drill pipe, but weighs less than 50 percent of its steel <b>counterpart.</b> <b>Funding</b> for the multiyear {{research and development of}} CDP was provided by the U. S. Department of Energy Office of Fossil Energy through the Natural Gas and Oil Projects Management Division at the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). Composite materials made of carbon fibers and epoxy resin offer mechanical properties comparable to steel at less than half the weight. Composite drill pipe consists of a composite material tube with standard drill pipe steel box and pin connections. Unlike metal drill pipe, composite drill pipe can be easily designed, ordered, and produced to meet specific requirements for specific applications. Because it uses standard joint connectors, CDP can be used in lieu of any part of or for the entire steel drill pipe section. For low curvature extended reach, deep directional drilling, or ultra deep onshore or offshore drilling, the increased strength to weight ratio of CDP will increase the limits in all three drilling applications. Deceased weight will reduce hauling costs and increase the amount of drill pipe allowed on offshore platforms. In extreme extended reach areas and high-angle directional drilling, drilling limits are associated with both high angle (fatigue) and frictional effects resulting from the combination of high angle curvature and/or total weight. The radius of curvature for a hole as small as 40 feet (12. 2 meters) or a build rate of 140 degrees per 100 feet is within the fatigue limits of specially designed CDP. Other properties that can be incorporated into the design and manufacture of composite drill pipe and make it attractive for specific applications are corrosion resistance, non-magnetic intervals, and abrasion resistance coatings. Since CDP has little or no electromagnetic force fields up to 74 kilohertz (KHz), a removable section of copper wire can be placed inside the composite pipe to short the tool joints electrically allowing electromagnetic signals inside the collar to induce and measure the same within the rock formation. By embedding a pair of wires in the composite section and using standard drill pipe box and pin ends equipped with a specially developed direct contact joint electrical interface, power can be supplied to measurement-while-drilling (MWD) and logging-while-drilling (LWD) bottom hole assemblies. Instantaneous high-speed data communications between near drill bit and the surface are obtainable utilizing this 'smart' drilling technology. The composite drill pipe developed by ACPT has been field tested successfully in several wells nationally and internationally. These tests were primarily for short radius and ultra short radius directional drilling. The CDP in most cases performed flawlessly with little or no appreciable wear. ACPT is currently marketing a complete line of composite drill collars, subs, isolators, casing, and drill pipe to meet the drilling industry's needs and tailored to replace metal for specific application requirements...|$|E

40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{reducing}} the overall project cycle, it was recommended that the procedures for the selection of future projects be jointly reviewed by MOA and IFAD. Selection would {{take into account the}} socio-economic characteristics as well as potential resources of areas for intervention, rather than technical assessments of Government project proposals. The priority areas would be mutually agreed prior to Specific Identification on the basis of IFAD's strategy and mandate for rural poverty alleviation. IFAD would need to provide MOA with guidance on suitable material to be presented in support of such an approach. The Working Groups also recommended that the project preparation cycle should be reduced to the following steps, once the project was approved for the IFAD programme:(a) Specific Identification, which would aim to: (i) define the project area and development opportunities; (ii) inform and train local staff in the requirements for the preparation and appraisal of internationally-financed projects; (iii) undertake a socio-economic and production systems study. The resulting Identification Report would provide a basis for IFAD and the Government to agree on further preparation and subsequent Appraisal. Specific Identification work would be undertaken jointly by MOA and IFAD, with assistance from FAO/IC, and would be based on the background material collected in the project area by the local counterparts. It is likely that the process would require one or two supporting missions from IFAD and/or FAO/IC. As far as possible, MOA and local staff would undertake the necessary studies and surveys, with advisory support from FAO/IC;(b) Full Preparation, which would aim to produce a sufficiently detailed feasibility report for IFAD to appraise the project. It would be undertaken by a local preparation group or groups and the MOA, with supervision and support being provided by FAO-IC;(c) Appraisal, which would be the responsibility of IFAD. It was recommended that, in order to avoid duplication of data requests by expatriate staff on missions and to reduce the time spent by local staff in supporting and processing their data requirements, more direct access to available local statistics be arranged. This would particularly apply to data collected at county level and below. It was also recommended that the local preparation teams should be provided with the means to build a data base (hardware, software and related training) for use by successive missions during preparation and by the PMO during implementation. The Working Groups also recommended that MOA should consider the establishment of a Project Preparation Group, either within or attached to MOA. This would consist of a small, multi-disciplinary group of full-time specialists who would undertake project preparation with the assistance of short-term specialists recruited from a range of technical institutions. They could also be responsible for central-level project coordination. Initially, this Group could be trained during the preparation of the next IFAD projects. Subsequently, the Group could offer its services on a cost-recovery basis to any multi- or bi-lateral agency. The possibility of using financial resources from the current UNDP Umbrella Project for the establishment of the Group would need to be explored. Training and supervision support could be provided by FAO. It was recommended that the staff constituting the Group should initially be employed on a fixed-term contract basis. A number of possible interested local cooperating institutions and institutional arrangements for such a Group would have to be investigated by MOA prior to making a formal proposal. It was recommended that MOA should complete and expand their current Guidelines to cover the following topics:(a) international financing agencies' lending criteria and policies;(b) project preparation, loan negotiation and project implementation procedures. Local Project Offices should be provided with the Guidelines prior to Project Identification. It was also recommended that guidelines introducing Chinese operational procedures could be useful to support the work of visiting missions. While it was recognized that project management has been successful, it was recommended that, in designing projects, proposals should include a definition of institutional responsibilities for the implementation of specific components. Due attention should be given to the number of institutions required for the implementation of the components and, if possible, this number should be reduced.

40|$|Rt. Hon. Nicholas Braithwaite is Prime Minister of Grenada. Formerly {{he was an}} educationalist. As Youth Planner for the Commonwealth Secretariat he was {{involved}} in educational and development programmes in many Commonwealth countries and spent several years working in the South Pacific. Many countries in the Caribbean contemplate a dilemma regarding economic development: to what effect and how rapidly should tourism be developed, bearing in mind the risk of drawing away resources and labour from agriculture? Some other ACP countries face the same choice. I believe that there is the opportunity for tourism and agriculture to benefit each other rather than for one to develop {{at the expense of the}} other. We in Grenada have been developing tourism, and rightly so. We have seen a collapse in our nutmeg industry, fluctuating prices for our cocoa and uncertainty hangs over our banana exports to the EC following adoption of the single market. But agriculture must remain the most important sector in the development of Grenada. With tourism we get additional visitors and they surely provide a greater market for our farmers. What we want our farmers to do, is to go into a diversification programme that would stress the importance of fruits, vegetables and other crops. We see the production of fruit and vegetables for our tourist hotels as providing the linkage between tourism and agricultural development. Unfortunately, agriculture has been in decline in Grenada in recent years but we have now taken definite steps to ensure that there is a revival in the industry. We have made more estate lands available for settlement by farmers and we have had technical assistance from French and Taiwanese missions to identify new markets end new crops. ClDA and the UN World Food Programme have helped us to strengthen the infrastructure including plant quarantine facilities, rehabilitation of cocoa and packhouse facilities for exporting fruit and vegetables. We are concerned at this time to deal with the productive sectors of our economy with agriculture as a first priority because if a country like ours has a fiscal problem it is as well to consider structural adjustment, a programme we are engaged in currently in Grenada. In such a programme we can reduce expenditure by reducing the size of the public service; we can privatize to get money to provide <b>counterpart</b> <b>funding</b> for some of our infrastructural development projects. But, in the final analysis, the single most important area for concentration is increased production, because if we do not earn more we are going to find ourselves in recession for a long time. In addition, structural adjustment is likely to lead to unacceptably high levels of unemployment and agriculture provides one of the ways in which we can provide additional employment opportunities for our people. In order to achieve this, however, we must show that agriculture and, through agriculture, agro-industries can offer people a reasonable standard of living. While we seek to diversify into vegetables and fruit, we have also to continue to make the most of our nutmeg, cocoa and bananas. It is clear that there is a threat to the banana growing countries of CARICOM: Belize, Jamaica and the Windward Islands. If we do not get some special concessions as provided in the Lomé Convention, we are going to be in serious difficulties. But competition is a reality we have to face and in the first place we have to make sure that we look at something that is unique, in my view, and that is quality. We also have to emphasize productivity, because the higher the yield the greater the chances of being able to sell at a slightly lower level. Quality is going to become more and more important in an increasingly competitive market. Finally, there is the urgent need to develop agro-industries as part of our agricultural development. What we have had so far is a cottage-type industry where we have used some of our raw materials for making syrups, jams, jellies, sauces and packages of spices. In future we will have to produce in large quantities because unless we can supply local market demands our supermarkets and tourist hotels will continue to import from abroad. We must also change the attitude of some people that the imported item is in some way superior to the home-produced one. So there is undoubtedly the prospect of a dynamic agriculture supplying exports, the tourist industry and agro-processing industries and this could offer our young people worthwhile careers. Unfortunately I cannot say at this time, with the confidence that I would like to, that we can see a change in attitude of our youth towards agriculture. Nevertheless, I am hopeful and the key factor will be to demonstrate that agriculture can pay. The problem we have had with our previous land tenure system with estates and the majority of people involved in agriculture being workers, is that agriculture has been seen in relation to poverty. But if, through ownership of land, we can develop a system of farming where young people can become self-employed, then I think the youth would be attracted. The essential element will be to show that the income from agriculture would allow people to enjoy the same standard of living as a teacher or a civil servant. It is a challenge but one that we must accept in Grenada and, I suspect, in many other ACP countries also. The views expressed are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CTA. Rt.

In 2005 the CAF reassigned US$25m from a non-disbursing water and sanitation sector modernization and rehabilitation loan to environmental projects. At the beginning of 2008, the CAF announced that it has approved a water and sanitaton loan for the Venezuelan states of Amazonas, Anzoátegui, Aragua, Bolívar, Cojedes, Delta Amacuro, Sucre and Trujillo. The program is estimated to have a total cost of US$72.3m, of which CAF will finance US$50m, the remainder being financed by local <b>counterpart</b> <b>funds.</b> The program will be executed by Hidroven.|$|R
40|$|Summaries The author {{examines}} aggregate and categorical fungibility for {{the recipient}} of untied foreign exchange. Aggregate fungibility considers {{the impact of the}} funds received on either external account aggregates such as imports or exports, or the overall level of revenue, expenditure and government borrowing. Analysis of categorical fungibility looks inside the item of most interest to the donor (import composition in the case of import support and sectoral expenditure for <b>counterpart</b> <b>funds</b> and budget aid). These questions are best answered by macroeconomic modelling, but the data are rarely available. Hence a more ad hoc approach must be used. Aggregate fungibility may be analysed through the construction of a counterfactual balance of payments and government budget, where behavioural reactions are judged by the evaluator on the basis of own analysis, existing studies and guestimates. Categorical fungibility may be analysed using the budget constraint approach in conjunction with a counterfactual government budget...|$|R
25|$|The Organisation for European Economic Co-operation {{took the}} leading role in allocating funds, and the OEEC {{arranged}} for {{the transfer of the}} goods. The American supplier was paid in dollars, which were credited against the appropriate European Recovery Program funds. The European recipient, however, was not given the goods as a gift, but had to pay for them (usually on credit) in local currency. These payments were kept by the European government involved in a special <b>counterpart</b> <b>fund.</b> This <b>counterpart</b> money, in turn, could be used by the government for further investment projects. Five percent of the counterpart money was paid to the US to cover the administrative costs of the ERP. The Marshall Plan money was in the form of grants that {{did not have to be}} repaid. In addition to ERP grants, the Export-Import Bank (an agency of the US government) at the same time made long-term loans at low interest rates to finance major purchases in the US, all of which were repaid.|$|R
40|$|Official {{development}} assistance (grants and subsidized loans from foreign aid agencies) {{is the main}} source of external finance in developing countries. These financial aid flows are positively correlated with the recipients' business cycles, which is puzzling because it reinforces already strong and costly macroeconomic fluctuations in the recipient countries. We propose an explanation related to a familiar corporate finance theory of inside equity commitments. We assume that donor agencies and recipient governments value projects differently, and that donors know less than recipients do about projects. We show that donors can make an aid recipient idientify high-return projects by conditioning aid on the recipient's committing some of its own funds to the selected projects. This commitment makes recommending bad projects costly. Contributing "counterpart funds" is more difficult during economic downturns, however - which leads to aid procyclicality. This simple model of investment financing and aid provision produces aid contracts consistent with those used by aid agencies, rationalizes observed aid flow patterns, and yields a rich set of testable empirical predictions.
