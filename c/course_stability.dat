Most of newly-designed ships 2 ̆ 7 maneuver abilities are examined by the model tests in a towing tank. Although，the drawback of this experimental method {{is that it will}} have high running costs to investigate the <b>course</b> <b>stability.</b> In the present state，it is too costly to conduct the experiments of maneuvering motions with a fishing vessel in the towing tank. The authors have proposed the simple evaluation method of the <b>course</b> <b>stability</b> by using a circulating water channei. However，the model of the ship is too small to mount lts power motor and propeller. The simple evaluation method neglected the influence of propeller race on the <b>course</b> <b>stability.</b> In this paper，the simple evaluation method is improved and takes into account the influence of propeller race on slewing motions in a circulating water channel. As the towing point moves forward at a constant speed，the amplitude of slewing motion decreases and its period gets longer. The index of evaluation (aT) is represented by the point of towing from the center of gravity. Accordingly，the influence of propeller race (△aT) is the difference between the index of evaluation on a propeller working and the one of a dummy boss. The results are checked and compared with the <b>course</b> <b>stability</b> of sea trials.

Accordingly，the index of evaluation is represented by the point of towing from the center of gravity of ship and the value of the amplitude divided by the period (2 πa/T). The results are checked that compared with the <b>course</b> <b>stability</b> criterions by means of derivatives of hydrodynamic forces and moments.

40|$|Concern for {{the safe}} navigation, the {{presence}} of an external force which directly induced on the ship maneuvering behavior is important to be captured. This paper discusses the <b>course</b> <b>stability</b> and yaw motion of ships traveling under steady wind condition in an analytical way. A <b>course</b> <b>stability</b> criterion and approximate formulas of yaw motion in steady wind including aero/hydro-dynamic force derivatives on the ship are derived. To confirm the reliability of the criterion and the formulas, the investigation results are introduced for the Pure Car Carrier (PCC) in steady wind. The results reveal that the course instability appears in head and following wind directions is mainly caused by the influence of aerodynamic derivatives with respect to the yaw restoring forces. However, the course instability can be easily improved by using a steering control. In the range from head wind to beam wind, the yaw oscillation appears where the period is relatively long and the damping is small. The analytical formulas newly derived are useful for {{a better understanding of the}} ship maneuvering behavior in steady wind. ...|$|E

Neurasthenia is recognized by ICD- 10, but not by DSM-IV. Its course, longitudinal stability and relationship to depression is not well understood. METHODS: In a stratified community sample (n = 591), representative of 2600 persons of the canton of Zurich, Switzerland, neurasthenia and depression were assessed in six structured interviews between ages 20 and 41. <b>Course,</b> <b>stability</b> and comorbidity were examined. A severity spectrum of neurasthenia and depression from symptoms to diagnosis was taken into account. RESULTS: The annual prevalence of a neurasthenia diagnosis increased from 0. 7 % to 3. 8 % from age 22 - 41, while mere symptoms became less prevalent. Intraindividual courses improved in 40 % and deteriorated in about 30 % of symptomatic cases. The most frequent symptoms overall, besides criterial exhaustion, were increased need for sleep, over-sensitivity, nervousness and difficulty concentrating. Cross-sectional associations and overlap with depression were strong. Longitudinal stability of ICD-neurasthenia was low.
