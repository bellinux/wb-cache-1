50|$|Neuro-electronic {{interfacing}} is {{a visionary}} goal {{dealing with the}} construction of nanodevices that will permit computers to be joined and linked to the nervous system. This idea requires the building of a molecular structure that will permit control and detection of nerve impulses by an external computer. A refuelable strategy implies energy is refilled <b>continuously</b> <b>or</b> <b>periodically</b> with external sonic, chemical, tethered, magnetic, or biological electrical sources, while a nonrefuelable strategy implies that all power is drawn from internal energy storage which would stop when all energy is drained. A nanoscale enzymatic biofuel cell for self-powered nanodevices have been developed that uses glucose from biofluids including human blood and watermelons. One limitation to this innovation is the fact that electrical interference or leakage or overheating from power consumption is possible. The wiring of the structure is extremely difficult because they must be positioned precisely in the nervous system. The structures that will provide the interface must also be compatible with the body's immune system.|$|E
40|$|The {{co-combustion}} {{of municipal}} solid waste (MSW) is a novel and highly integrated design combining cement manufacturing, thermal processing of MSW and energy/electricity production (termed the Co-Co process). This novel design of the Co-Co process was developed in 2003 - 2004 and a pilot plant with a capacity of 40 tonnes per day was constructed and commissioned in 2005. The pilot plant was operated {{for a period of}} 10 weeks during 2005. Various feed protocols, namely, MSW as received and after removal of recyclables, were tested. Stack emissions were monitored either <b>continuously</b> (gas emission) <b>or</b> <b>periodically</b> (dioxins and heavy metal emissions). Solid residues including bottom ash and fly ash were also sampled and analysed for heavy metals and dioxins periodically. It was found that the levels of dioxins in the stack emissions and fly ash were below normal MSW thermal treatment processes, and government environmental and international limits (more than 1000 times less). Other gases, such CO, NOx, SOx and HCl, were also well below government environmental licence limits as defined by a best practical means (BPM). In addition, the materials recovery and recycling facility (MRRF) was tested. It demonstrated that different fractions, including metals, plastics and glass, of the MSW could be separated and recovered. The Co-Co process was successfully demonstrated and its emission levels were well below normal MSW thermal treatment processes.

50|$|Outdoor: Billboards, {{also known}} as hoardings {{in some parts of}} the world, are large {{structures}} located in public places which display advertisements to passing pedestrians and motorists. Most often, they are located on main roads with a large amount of passing motor and pedestrian traffic; however, they can be placed in any location with large amounts of viewers, such as on mass transit vehicles and in stations, in shopping malls or office buildings, and in stadiums. The form known as street advertising first came to prominence in the UK by Street Advertising Services to create outdoor advertising on street furniture and pavements. Working with products such as Reverse Graffiti, air dancers and 3D pavement advertising, for getting brand messages out into public spaces. Sheltered outdoor advertising combines outdoor with indoor advertisement by placing large mobile, structures (tents) in public places on temporary bases. The large outer advertising space aims to exert a strong pull on the observer, the product is promoted indoors, where the creative decor can intensify the impression. Mobile billboards are generally vehicle mounted billboards or digital screens. These can be on dedicated vehicles built solely for carrying advertisements along routes preselected by clients, they can also be specially equipped cargo trucks or, in some cases, large banners strewn from planes. The billboards are often lighted; some being backlit, and others employing spotlights. Some billboard displays are static, while others change; for example, <b>continuously</b> <b>or</b> <b>periodically</b> rotating among a set of advertisements. Mobile displays are used for various situations in metropolitan areas throughout the world, including: target advertising, one-day and long-term campaigns, conventions, sporting events, store openings and similar promotional events, and big advertisements from smaller companies.|$|E

Sensing policies are considered in the context of slack-descriptor system models, which allows the representation of uncertain dynamics and sensor uncertainty through linear constraints. 1.

Time-varying volume data take large storage space and visualizing them requires reading large files <b>continuously</b> <b>or</b> <b>periodically</b> {{throughout the course of}} the visualization process. Instead of using all the processors to collectively render one volume at a time, a pipelined rendering process is formed by partitioning processors into groups to render multiple volumes concurrently. In this way, the overall rendering time may be greatly reduced because the pipelined rendering tasks are overlapped with the I/O required to load each volume into a group of processors; moreover, parallelization overhead may be reduced as a result of partitioning the processors. We modify an existing parallel volume renderer to exploit various levels of rendering parallelism and to study how the partitioning of processors may lead to optimal rendering performance.

Structural health monitoring (SHM) can be defined as the continuous monitoring of a bridge’s state properties, such as static and dynamic response, in order to diagnose the onset of anomalous structural behaviour. This involves measuring and evaluating the state properties and relating these to defined performance parameters. The process of measuring state properties, either <b>continuously</b> <b>or</b> <b>periodically,</b> produces large quantities of data and by careful analysis of these data, sudden and gradual changes in the bridge’s behaviour can be identified and characterised. The ability of wavelet transforms to detect abrupt changes, gradual change beginnings and ends of events make them well suited for the analysis of bridge health monitoring data.

One application involves using RFID sensors external to the human body, while another one uses {{both internal and external}} RFID sensors.

All the assessment and monitoring are done wirelessly, either <b>continuously</b> <b>or</b> <b>periodically</b> in any interval, in which the sensors collect information on human parts such as the lungs or heart and transmit this information to a router, PC or PDA device connected to the internet, from which patient’s condition can be diagnosed and viewed by authorized medical professionals in remote locations. Instantaneous information allows medical professionals to intervene properly and in a timely fashion to prevent possible catastrophic effects to patients. The continuously assessed and monitored information provides medical professionals with more complete and long-term studies of patients.
