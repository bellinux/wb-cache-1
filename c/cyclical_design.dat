40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{innovation and}} design processes in small established companies. There {{is a great}} interest in this area yet paradoxically the area is under-researched, since most innovation research is done on large companies. The research questions are: How do small established companies carry out their innovation and design processes? and How does the context and novelty of the process and product affect the same processes? The thesis is built on three research papers that used the research method of multiple case studies of different small established companies. The innovation and design processes found were highly context dependent and were facilitated by committed resources, a creative climate, vision, low family involvement, delegated power and authority, and linkages to external actors such as customers and users. Both experimental cyclical and linear structured design processes were found. The choice of structure is explained by the relative product and process novelty experienced by those developing the product innovation. Linear design processes worked within a low relative novelty situation and <b>cyclical</b> <b>design</b> processes worked no matter the relative novelty. The innovation and design processes found were informal, with a low usage of formal systematic design methods, except in the case of design processes for software. The use of formal systematic methods in small companies seems not always to be efficient, because many of the problems the methods are designed to solve are not present. Customers and users were found to play a large and important role in the innovation and design processes found and gave continuous feedback during the design processes. Innovation processes were found to be intertwined, yielding synergy effects, but it was common that resources were taken from the innovation processes for acute problems that threatened the cash flow. In sum, small established companies have the natural prerequisites to take advantage of lead-user inventions and <b>cyclical</b> <b>design</b> processes. Scarce resources were found to be the main factor hindering innovation, but the examined companies practiced several approaches to increase their resources or use existing scarce resources more efficiently in their innovation and design processes. Examples of these approaches include adopting lead-user inventions and reducing formality in the innovation and design processes. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{development}} of a course for experienced teachers in the Netherlands, intended to enhance their professionalism by engaging them in doing research based on reflection on the aims of their educational efforts. The course was accompanied by design-based research. The research question was whether and how the course stimulated teachers to connect doing research and taking a reflective stance; the results were used to improve the course, thus creating a <b>cyclical</b> <b>design.</b> Although the course was positively evaluated by the participants, reflection on its results made clear to us that our approach in the combination of learning to do research and reflecting on aims is not enough to make teachers into critical research-minded professionals. A more context-aware view of their learning process is necessary: the institution school limits their possibilities. The implication is that both our course and our research effort have to be critically revised. Instead of looking for causal effects, one should be aware of traces of development {{that may or may not}} be caused by the intervention. © 2013 Taylor and Francis...|$|E

40|$|As a new {{paradigm}} in healthcare design in the 21 st century, evidence-based design (EBD) has {{played a critical role}} in the changing hospital architectural design process and shaping new images of hospital architecture. Evidence-based design is research informed, and its results affect not only patients' clinical outcomes but also medical facility operational efficiency and its staff retention and satisfaction. This research investigated how EBD was implemented in hospital architectural design and how traditional design process was modified to incorporate credible research evidence through a case study at Grand River Hospital in the United States. This study took a qualitative approach with grounded theory methodology. The methods used for this research were multiple sources of data collection through document reviews, observations, and interviews. Findings revealed that the investigation for EBD needs to focus on environment-behavior studies especially in the development of explanatory theory. This study also recommended a modified <b>cyclical</b> <b>design</b> process model for integrating EBD. This redefined design process model requires collaborations with all stakeholders by adding visioning sessions, multiple design charrettes, mock-ups, and the functional performance evaluation to help to implement research evidence and make design decisions to achieve the best possible outcomes...|$|E
40|$|As markets demand {{engineered}} products faster, {{waiting on}} the <b>cyclical</b> <b>design</b> processes {{of the past is}} not an option. Instead, industry is turning to concurrent design and interdisciplinary teams. When these teams collaborate, engineering CAD tools {{play a vital role in}} conceptualizing and validating designs. These tools require significant user investment to master, due to challenging interfaces and an overabundance of features. These challenges often prohibit team members from using these tools for exploring designs. This work presents a method allowing users to interact with a design using intuitive gestures and head tracking, all while keeping the model in a CAD format. Specifically, Siemens 2 ̆ 7 Teamcenter® Lifecycle Visualization Mockup (Mockup) was used to display design geometry while modifications were made through a set of gestures captured by a Microsoft KinectTM in real time. This proof of concept program allowed a user to rotate the scene, activate Mockup 2 ̆ 7 s immersive menu, move the immersive wand, and manipulate the view based on head position. This work also evaluates gesture usability and task completion time for this proof of concept system. A cognitive model evaluation method was used to evaluate the premise that gesture-based user interfaces are easier to use and learn with regards to time than a traditional mouse and keyboard interface. Using a cognitive model analysis tool allowed the rapid testing of interaction concepts without the significant overhead of user studies and full development cycles. The analysis demonstrated that using the KinectTM is a feasible interaction mode for CAD/CAE programs. In addition, the analysis pointed out limitations in the gesture interfaces ability to compete time wise with easily accessible customizable menu options...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that the {{emergence}} of environmental activism and awareness came largely with Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring, first published in 1962. However, fashion has been late to follow this trend with some estimates unbelievably placing the emergence of sustainably aware fashion as recently as 2010. As such, the fashion industry is still responsible for a large proportion of global pollution at almost every stage of garment existence, from production through to disposal. Petrochemicals, toxic chemical dyes and energy intensive recycling are just the start. Current efforts of the fashion industry to become sustainable aim only to make the system ‘less bad’ with initiatives focusing often on one aspect of the process, for example with fair trade, rather than looking at the whole. What may be obtained fairly will most likely meet the same end as that which was obtained ‘unfairly’ be that in landfill or perhaps sent abroad for alternative use. I will argue that this is the reason for a total overhaul of the current fashion industry processes. This thesis aims to illustrate that bio-design is the only viable option to replace this unsustainable fashion system. The use of living materials in bio-design allows for a <b>cyclical</b> <b>design</b> process in which nothing is taken from nature that cannot be given back. The Tissue Culture & Art Project and Suzanne Lee use bio-design in the production of new materials, whilst Natsai Audrey Chieza and Blond & Bieber create bio-designed garment dyes. Bio-design includes a wide array of processes including biomimicry and synthetic biology and so these cases have been chosen to show as many facets of this as possible in order to demonstrate the huge potential of the field for creating sustainable fashion...|$|E

40|$|We have {{conceived}} and implemented a <b>cyclical</b> protein <b>design</b> strategy that couples theory, computation, and experimental testing. The combinatorially {{large number of}} possible sequences and the incomplete understanding {{of the factors that}} control protein structure are the primary obstacles in protein design. Our protein design automation algorithm objectively predicts protein sequences likely to achieve a desired fold. Using a rotamer description of the side chains, we implemented a fast discrete search algorithm based on the Dead-End Elimination Theorem to rapidly find the globally optimal sequence in its optimal geometry from the vast number of possible solutions. Rotamer sequences were scored for steric complementarity using a van der Waals potential. A Monte Carlo search was then executed, starting at the optimal sequence, in order to find other high-scoring sequences. As a test of the design methodology, high-scoring sequences were found for the buried hydrophobic residues of a homodimeric coiled coil based on GCN 4 -p 1. The corresponding peptides were synthesized and characterized by CD spectroscopy and size-exclusion chromatography. All peptides were dimeric and nearly 100 % helical at 1 °C, with melting temperatures ranging from 24 °C to 57 °C. A quantitative structure activity relation analysis was performed on the designed peptides, and a significant correlation was found with surface area burial. Incorporation of a buried surface area potential in the scoring of sequences greatly improved the correlation between predicted and measured stabilities and demonstrated experimental feedback in a complete design cycle...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{describe}} the wrist kinematics during movement through free {{range of motion}} and {{activities of daily living}} using a <b>cyclical</b> task. <b>Design.</b> The wrist angles were initially calculated in a calibration trial and then in two selected activities of daily living (jar opening and carton pouring). Background. Existing studies which {{describe the}} wrist movement do not address the specific application of daily activities. Moreover, the data presented from subject to subject may differ simply because of the non-cyclical nature of the upper limbs movements. Methods. The coordinates of external markers attached to bone references on the forearm and dorsal side of the hand were obtained using an optical motion capture system. The wrist angles were derived from free motion trials and successively calculated in four healthy subjects for two specific cyclical daily activities (opening a jar and pouring from a carton). Results. The free motions trial highlighted the interaction between the wrist angles. Both the jar opening and the carton pouring activity showed a repetitive pattern for the three angles within the cycle length. In the jar-opening task, the standard deviation for the whole population was 10. 8 degrees for flexion-extension, 5. 3 degrees for radial-ulnar deviation and 10. 4 degrees for pronation-supination. In the carton-pouring task, the standard deviation for the whole population was 16. 0 degrees for flexion-extension, 3. 4 degrees for radial-ulnar deviation and 10. 7 degrees for pro nation-supination. Conclusion. Wrist kinematics in healthy subjects can be successfully described by the rotations about the axes of marker-defined coordinates systems during free range of motion and daily activities using cyclical tasks...|$|R
40|$|Discussion {{regarding}} {{the introduction of}} engineering into the pre-college classrooms has been advancing and several countries have already started integrated engineering related material, usually through technology, science or computer science courses. A number of important questions emerge around engineering curriculum and pedagogical fidelity, namely, how is content presented, how is it integrated within current educational practices, and how are student dispositions towards engineering content and the profession impacted? Design Based Learning (DBL) {{seems to be an}} approach that addresses both the content and the professional aspect of this discussion. It has been argued that following a <b>cyclical</b> <b>design</b> process may assist students in developing cognitive engineering related skills. Regarding motivational effects and interest in the engineering profession, DBL appears to have a positive affect as well [1]. This is a comparative qualitative phenomenological study. The population includes 83 total students, 43 female and 40 male, attending 4 classrooms in the last grade in a public gymnasium, which is the equivalent of a 9 th grade. Students in two of the four classrooms followed a standard teacher-oriented computer science (CS) course, whereas the other two received the same content while participating in a computer design project. Qualitative analysis of questionnaires completed by students indicated that those who followed the standard teacher-oriented CS course did not demonstrate significant change in either their motivation towards the content, or towards the profession. Review of students who followed the design project approach revealed that 70 % of the students that had a negative disposition towards the content changed their answer to positive, while all students that had a positive disposition towards the content retained it. Regarding their motivation towards the profession, no significant difference was demonstrated in the student's answers. Analysis of open ended questions posed to the students, and factors that appeared to influence their motivation towards content and profession are also discussed in the paper...|$|E
40|$|Sustainable Product-Service Systems (S. PSS) carry great {{potential}} to deliver social well-being and economic prosperity while operating {{within the limits}} of our planet. They can however be complex to design, test, implement and bring to the mainstream. To increase our understanding of the potential benefits, drivers and barriers in S. PSS design, the research community has been inspired to collect and analyse an extensive number of cases in diverse sectors and to develop and test several design methods and tools. This Special Volume on "New Design Challenges to Widely Implement 'Sustainable Product-Service Systems'" presents results of key studies in the following areas: user satisfaction and acceptance of S. PSS solutions, how industrial partnerships and stakeholder interactions can be designed for environmental and socio-ethical benefits, how knowledge of socio-technical change and transition management feeds S. PSS design processes, and the role of policy instruments to foster their implementation and scale-up. This Introduction reviews the current state of research and summarises the articles presented. The articles demonstrate increasing confidence in integrating approaches and theoretical frameworks from other arenas. These approaches include sociological practice theory, to shed new light on consumer practices in S. PSS configurations, and strategic niche management, to foster a suitable design and experimentation milieu. Experimentation, iteration and <b>cyclical</b> <b>design</b> processes were also seen by many authors as crucial to implementing and stabilising S.

Finally this Introduction highlights key issues for a design research agenda, including but not limited to the development of new knowledge to support S. PSS designers (such as S. PSS design in low and middle-income contexts) and the role of Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) in the diffusion of knowledge and know-how to companies.

40|$|Since its {{conception}} {{over fifty}} years ago Virtual Reality (VR) has shown great promise to enhance the product design process. In {{the last twenty years}} alone, VR has seen remarkable growth in capability and adoption in industry. Technical advancements, in both software and hardware, enable designers and engineers to conceptualize, design, explore, and evaluate product designs virtually; without the need for physical prototypes. Because the product design process consists of thousands of questions, it is important to investigate how virtual reality can facilitate and support decision making within this process. The goal of this research is to investigate the current state of decision making in the product design process using immersive computing environments. From the results, a new design approach is proposed that integrates normative and descriptive methodologies. Concrete instances of the proposed design approach are illustrated to guide future research. The research begins with an in-depth industry survey which identifies and describes salient VR practices and trends. The survey is complemented by an examination of a case study involving a real-life design review in VR. Next, a new design methodology leveraging both descriptive and normative design approaches and implemented in a virtual environment is proposed. The method outlines a process that efficiently integrates natural human interaction (descriptive) with complex quantitative analysis (normative) to support decision making in the product design process. The result is a design environment that leverages the unique characteristics of VR to support decision making. Outcomes of this work suggest that VR is being actively applied to a myriad of product design challenges across a variety of disciplines. Through immersive visualization and interaction, users can achieve a stronger understanding of product designs. The integration of descriptive and normative approaches results in a synergistic and <b>cyclical</b> <b>design</b> process in which the strengths of one approach complements the weaknesses of the other. Future research will investigate new and novel approaches to better support the product design process...|$|E
40|$|A {{sustainable}} {{global community}} requires the successful integration of environment and engineering. In {{the public and}} private sectors, <b>designing</b> <b>cyclical</b> ("closed loop") resource networks increasingly appears as a strategy employed to improve resource efficiency and reduce environmental impacts. Patterning industrial networks on ecological ones has been shown to provide significant improvements at multiple levels. Here, we apply the biological metric cyclicity to 28 familiar thermodynamic power cycles of increasing complexity. These cycles, composed of turbines and the like, are scientifically very different from natural ecosystems. Despite this difference, the application results in a positive correlation between the maximum thermal efficiency and the cyclic structure of the cycles. The immediate impact of these findings results in a simple method for comparing cycles to one another, higher cyclicity values pointing to those cycles which have the potential for a higher maximum thermal efficiency. Such a strong correlation has the promise of impacting both natural ecology and engineering thermodynamics and provides a clear motivation to look for more fundamental scientific connections between natural and engineered systems...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} social design {{is to create}} a {{feasible}} solution in order to solve a particular problem. For some time, social designs have been made by social entrepreneurs using unauthorized methodologies formed through lessons from their own activities and experiences. They regard these methodologies as practical, but they are often difficult to design, especially in complex social systems where multiple stakeholders are involved. Participatory systems analysis (PSA) is another valuable methodology in social design, as it provides various stakeholders with the opportunity to share their mental models with each other, to recognize and understand issues, and to identify potential barriers and drivers towards creating solutions. This method is effective in developing a consensus for finding the best solutions. The {{purpose of this study was}} to create a model to design consensual solutions for an important social issue in Japan involving the high number of NEETS, a term referring to people who are “Not in Employment, Education, or Training. ” The mental models of various stakeholders were integrated into a systems structure or causal loop model to develop an understanding of the interrelationships and patterns among the components of the model. The model was used to identify the main leverage points and systemic interventions that could help in solving the NEET problem. Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) modeling was then used for each of the identified leverage points to design an integrated systemic management and operational plan for addressing the NEET issue, which has not yet been successfully addressed in Japan. The systems models (CLM and BBN) were embedded in the Evolutionary Learning Laboratory to create a <b>cyclical</b> social <b>design</b> through which the solutions can be implemented.

In order to propose a mental model, we can take in a particular I psychological research approach, that of introspective observation from design drawing. In doing so, we posit an assumption that the designer's drawing can be seen as an extension of the internal mental feature, and hence internal representation could be inferred from the analysis of external representation - the drawing or sketch.

A <b>cyclical</b> changeover <b>design</b> experiment (3 -wk periods; 12 -wk total) {{was conducted to}} evaluate whether improving the balance of absorbable AA would allow the feeding of less crude protein (CP) without compromising production, thereby reducing the potential environmental pollution from dairy farms. Sixteen multiparous Holstein cows were assigned to 1 of 8 dietary treatments as total mixed rations (TMR) containing [dry matter (DM) basis] 45 % corn silage, 5 % coarsely chopped wheat straw, and 50 % concentrate mixture. The 8 treatments were formulated to differ in dietary CP (14 and 16 %; DM basis) and {{in the balance of}} absorbable AA achieved by changing the main protein source (MPS) of the concentrate mixtures [replacing soybean meal (SBM) with corn byproducts (CBP), dried corn distillers grains (DDG), and some corn gluten meal], and by adding a mixture of rumen-protected Lys and Met (RPLM). Feeding lactating dairy cows corn silage-based diets with 16 % CP promoted significantly higher DM intakes and milk yields, and lower feed N-use efficiency than feeding diets with 14 % CP. Replacing SBM with CBP significantly increased milk yields and decreased milk fat and protein concentrations, but had no effect on the efficiency of conversion of feed N into milk N.

This paper proposes a new hybrid network architecture by leveraging the use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as an aerial mobile base station, which flies cyclically along the cell edge to serve the cell-edge MTs and help offload data traffic from the GBS. We aim to maximize the minimum throughput of all MTs in the cell, by jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory, {{as well as the}} bandwidth allocation and user partitioning between the UAV and GBS.

"Real experiments" combine knowledge production and knowledge application in real-world cases. The authors discuss the history of the scientific experiment. They present lessons learned from the early Chicago school of sociology about "society as laboratory". Four case studies (cattle farming in Tanzania, the ecological restoration of Montrose Point, Chicago and of Sempachersee, Switzerland, and the system of waste treatment in Germany) are re-constructed in detail, using Grounded Theory methodology. These represent four different kinds of ecological "real experiment". What is typical of "real experiments" is a recursive and <b>cyclical</b> process of <b>design,</b> intervention and learning. The book concludes with some thoughts on the design of robust and successful "real experiments", but here the degree of concreteness found in the case studies is absent. Although "Real Experiments" makes interesting reading for STS (Science and Technology Studies) researchers, professionals in the field of eco-system management and related areas will miss guidelines for best-practice "real experiments". A further shortcoming is the restriction of the book to the field of ecology, while the authors claim that this type of experimentation has general relevance in knowledge societies.

In particular, {{we focus on}} different design techniques, i. e. how to combine the attribute levels into alternatives and choice sets, for choice experiments. Design is a vital issue in choice experiments since the combination of alternatives in the choice sets will determine the degree of precision obtainable from the estimates and welfare measures. In this paper we compare orthogonal, <b>cyclical</b> and D-optimal <b>designs,</b> where the latter allows expectations about the true parameters to be included when creating the design. Moreover, we discuss how to obtain prior information on the parameters and how to conduct a sequential design procedure during the actual experiment {{in order to improve}} the precision in the estimates. The designs are evaluated according to their ability to predict the true marginal willingness to pay under different specifications of the utility function in Monte Carlo simulations. Our results suggest that the designs produce unbiased estimations, but orthogonal designs result in larger mean square error in comparison to D-optimal designs. This result is expected when using correct priors on the parameters in D-optimal designs. However, the simulations show that welfare measures are not very sensitive if the choice sets are generated from a D-optimal design with biased priors. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|We have {{conceived}} and implemented a <b>cyclical</b> protein <b>design</b> strategy that couples theory, computation and experimental testing. Our goal is an objective, quantitative design algorithm {{that is based}} on the physical properties that determine protein structure and stability and which is not limited to specific folds or motifs. Such a method should escape the lack of generality that has resulted from design approaches based on system-specific heuristics and/or subjective considerations. A critical component of the development of our methods has been their experimental testing and validation. The use of a design cycle coupling theory, computation, and experiment has improved our understanding of the physical chemistry governing protein design and hence enhanced the performance of the design algorithm. Our protein design automation algorithm objectively predicts protein sequences likely to achieve a desired fold by using a side-chain selection algorithm that explicitly and quantitatively considers specific side-chain to backbone and side-chain to side-chain interactions. Using a rotamer description of the side chains, we implemented a fast discrete search algorithm based on the Dead End Elimination Theorem to rapidly find the globally optimal sequence in its optimal geometry. We subdivided the sequence selection problem into regions of proteins expected to be dominated by different factors: the tightly packed buried core, the solvent exposed surface, and the boundary between core and surface. We assessed the accuracy of a scoring function or combination of scoring functions by experimentally testing their sequence predictions. Improvements to the scoring function were derived from the experimental data and incorporated into the design algorithm. In this manner, we developed a scoring function for the core of a protein that considers packing interactions and hydrophobic solvation energy. In order to design boundary residues effectively, the usually neglected effect of exposed hydrophobic surface area was addressed. Scoring functions for the design of surface residues were developed that account for hydrogen bonding interactions and secondary structure propensities of amino acids. These potential functions were used to successfully redesign several proteins. The integration of these scoring functions was tested by designing the sequence for an entire protein and solving the NMR solution structure of the designed protein.

Total DM intake was similar among cows fed the bi-crop silages and GS 9 diets, but intakes for GS 6 were at least 1. 7 kg DM/d lower. Increasing the pea inclusion rate increased the crude protein (CP) content of the ration, {{but it did not}} enhance forage quality or animal performance. The rate of intake of the different forages was similar, so that the higher intakes of bi-crop silages were associated with more time spent at the feedbunk and an increased number of meals. Diet digestibility ranged from 531 to 650 g/kg, and the highest value was given by the Cut 1 bi-crop silage diet. Milk yield tended to be similar for cows fed the Cut 2 bi-crop and GS 9 diets, and these values were at least 1. 7 kg higher than those for cows fed on other treatments. Generally, the bi-crop diets resulted in higher milk fat contents and lower polyunsaturated fatty acid contents. Milk protein content was highest for cows fed the GS 9 diet. Blood metabolite content was unaffected by treatment except for blood urea nitrogen content, which was higher in cows fed the bi-crop silages, reflecting reduced N-use efficiency with these diets. The study showed that pea-wheat bi-crop silages can be used to replace moderate-quality grass silage in dairy cow rations, but their role as alternatives to high-quality forages requires additional investigation.

40|$|Though {{notoriously}} difficult, real-time programming offers {{children a}} rich {{new set of}} applications, {{and the opportunity to}} engage bodily knowledge and experience more centrally in intellectual enterprises. Moreover, the seemingly specialized problems of real-time programming can be seen as keys to longstanding difficulties of programming in general. I report on a critical design inquiry into the nature and potential of real-time programming by children. A <b>cyclical</b> process of <b>design,</b> prototyping and testing of computational environments has led to two design innovations: a language in which declarative and procedural descriptions of computation are given equal status, and can subsume each other to arbitrary levels of nesting [and] a "live text" environment, in which real-time display of, and intervention in, program execution are accomplished within the program text itself. Based on children's use of these tools, as well as comparative evidence from other media and domains, I argue that the coordination of discrete and continuous process should be considered a central Big Idea in programming and beyond. In addition, I offer the theoretical notion of the "steady frame" as a way to clarify the user interface requirements of real-time programming, and also to understand the role of programming in learning to construct dynamic models, theories, and representations. Implications for the role of programming in education and for the future of computational literacy are discussed. by Christopher Michael Hancock. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Muscles expend {{energy to}} perform active work during locomotion, {{but they may}} also expend {{significant}} energy to produce force, for example when tendons perform {{much of the work}} passively. The relative contributions of work and force to overall energy expenditure are unknown. We therefore measured the mechanics and energetics of a <b>cyclical</b> bouncing task, <b>designed</b> to control for work and force. We hypothesized that near bouncing resonance, little work would be performed actively by muscle, but the cyclical production of force would cost substantial metabolic energy. Human subjects (n = 9) bounced vertically about the ankles at inversely proportional frequencies (1 – 4 Hz) and amplitudes (15 – 4 mm), such that the overall rate of work performed on the body remained approximately constant (0. 30 ± 0. 06 W/kg), but the forces varied considerably. We used parameter identification to estimate series elasticity of the triceps surae tendon, as well as the work performed actively by muscle and passively by tendon. Net metabolic energy expenditure for bouncing at 1 Hz was 1. 15 ± 0. 31 W/kg, attributable mainly to active muscle work with an efficiency of 24 ± 3 %. But at 3 Hz (near resonance), most of the work was performed passively, so that active muscle work could account for only 40 % of the net metabolic rate of 0. 76 ± 0. 28 W/kg. Near resonance, a cost for cyclical force that increased with both amplitude and frequency of force accounted for at least as much of the total energy expenditure as a cost for work. Series elasticity reduces the need for active work, but energy must still be expended for force production...|$|R
40|$|In {{globally}} competitive circumstances {{promotion of}} education quality has become {{regarded as a}} crucial national activity with New Public Management ideas gaining prominence in school management policies. Head teachers or principals are now seen as critical leaders in schools and increasing their capabilities for professional leadership and management and performance through principal performance management (PPM) has received increasing attention. In Taiwan, following recent, massive political and social change, educational reforms have reshaped a new context in which principals have encountered {{a great deal of}} challenge and role change. Issues of PPM have rarely been explored in Taiwan. The purpose of the study is, hopefully, to formulate a PPM system from literature review and empirical research to provide reference points for its policy makers. The former was mainly focused on conceptual analysis of PPM, including the possible bearing of philosophical paradigms and psychological and administrative theories and the experience of PPM conducted in Britain and New Zealand, as well as its precursor in principal appraisal in Taiwan. From these a possible PPM model and its elements have been delineated. The latter was conducted by methodological triangulation which combined questionnaire survey of 392 educational administrators and principals of primary and junior high schools in 23 counties/cities in Taiwan, followed by in-depth interviews with 24 stakeholders chosen purposively from three counties/cities. It is suggested that Taiwanese administrators and principals would generally welcome a well planned, <b>cyclical</b> PPM system <b>designed</b> to help principals promote their professional capabilities and performance whose rationale was improvement-orientated accountability emphasising consensual objectives, cooperative partnership, shared commitment and sustainable development toward integrating individual and school objectives and the professional development and performance of principals. Suggestions are put forth to policy makers for setting up a practicable PPM policy aimed at integrating the HRM of principals and promotion of educational quality.

40|$|In {{the era of}} {{unravelling}} traditional {{business models}} in journalism (Downie and Schudson 2009) students {{must be prepared to}} develop the media products of the future. It has been argued that the future of journalism will be shaped by entrepreneurs who develop innovative business models and projects – either working on their own, with start [...] ‐ups, or within traditional media companies (Briggs 2011). To meet these changing demands, universities must adapt {{the way in which they}} prepare graduates with knowledge, skills and attributes to succeed in this rapidly changing world. This paper outlines a trial of the multi [...] ‐ disciplinary experiential entrepreneurship model (MEEM) with University of the Sunshine Coast journalism, business and design students. The MEEM centred on an industry innovation in the form of a Startup Weekend which enabled students, during one weekend, to create a start-up new media venture. Startup Weekends represent an international movement where nascent entrepreneurs meet and work on developing new ventures supported by business mentors, immersing themselves in the entrepreneurial process of moving an idea to market. During one weekend (54 hours), participants pitch ideas, form teams and ultimately launch companies. Startup Weekends have grown globally in recent years (Startup Weekend, 2013) and are used by leading universities in the US, such as Stanford, to provide experiential learning opportunities in entrepreneurship education (Pena, 2013). This project brings an international industry innovation, the Startup Weekend, to an Australian university context and embeds it within an educational experience, while empirically assessing its value. Overall, this paper will outline the use of design-based research as a method for evaluation, as it offered a systematic method of <b>cyclical</b> revision, analysis, <b>design,</b> development and implementation (Anderson and Shattuck, 2012). The concepts of design-based research are embedded in the practice of lean start-up entrepreneurship and as such formed the basis of not only the project development, but also the approach of venture development experience for students (Ries, 2011; Sarasvathy and Venkataraman, 2011) ...|$|R

Reciprocal recurrent selection is a <b>cyclical</b> breeding procedure <b>designed</b> to improve the interpopulation cross of two base populations. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the direct and indirect responses of 11 cycles of reciprocal recurrent selection in the BSSS(R) (Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic) and BSCB 1 (R) (Iowa Corn Borer Synthethic no. 1) maize populations. The populations per se, populations per se selfed, interpopulation crosses, and interpopulation crosses selfed corresponding to C 0, C 4, C 7, C 8, C 9, C 10, and C 11 of the populations were evaluated. Testcrosses of the original and advanced cycles of the populations per se with inbreds B 73 and Mo 17 and with BSSS(R) C 0 and BSCB 1 (R) C 0 also were evaluated in the study. Response in grain yield of the BSSS(R) × BSCB 1 (R) interpopulation cross was 6. 95 % (or 0. 28 Mg ha- 1) cycle- 1. Grain yield of BSCB 1 (R) increased 1. 94 % (or 0. 06 Mg ha- 1) cycle- 1, but grain yield of BSSS(R) did not change significantly. Midparent heterosis of the interpopulation cross increased from 25. 44 to 76. 04 % from C 0 to C 11. Inbreeding depression in the population crosses increased from 1. 01 to 2. 32 Mg ha- 1 after 11 cycles of selection. The frequency of heterozygotes for grain yield in the population crosses seems to have increased with cycles of selection. Testcrosses to the C 0 populations and the inbreds showed linear increases in grain yield, indicating that selection Improved general and specific combining ability of the populations. Selection was effective in reducing root and stalk lodging. No changes in grain moisture were observed. changes in other agronomic traits were in the desired direction...|$|R

Gómez Chova, A. López Martínez, I. Candel Torres (Ed.), Proceedings of iCERi 2016 - 9 th International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation (pp. 2440 - 2446). Seville, ES: IATED - International Association of Technology, Education and Development. ISBN: 978 - 84 - 617 - 5895 - 1 Worldwide, the e-Learning market has been growing faster and faster [1], but not without some disappointments [2]. One of the biggest setbacks regarding e-Learning is that related to the high rates of attrition [3] that leads to frustration [4] [5] [6] and, eventually, to dropout. Student dropout rates for e- Learning are 15 – 20 % higher than traditional face-to-face courses [7]. For all reasons that might have an influence in attrition and dropouts in e-Learning we argue that course design is the key. Therefore, the main {{question is how to}} design e-Learning courses with lower attrition and dropout rates? The primary objective of this Erasmus+ Strategic Partnership for adult education research project, is to produce a model to assist e-Learning course developer’s decisions based on scientific literature that will lead to the {{development of}} an implementation prototype. The specific objectives are: (i) to understand the relationship between course design in e-Learning with attrition and dropout; (ii) to identify dropout reasons in relations to course design in e-Learning; (iii) to validate course design as a problem affecting dropout in e-Learning; and (iv) to propose a decision-making course design model for a future prototype. As a methodological approach, we will use Development Research [8]. This methodology involves an interrelationship between theory and practice to create an effective intervention to a specific problem, which requires not only its analysis but also the construction of a particular process or product. We see the Development Research as a <b>cyclical</b> process of <b>designing,</b> testing, and redesigning, always incorporating feedback provided by all the actors. This process leads to new theoretical and empirically founded products, whereby the researchers get new insights, ultimately bringing {{the state of the art}} a step forward. Outgoing from the creation of our e-Learning prototype, we will collect information in a participatory manner, justifying the choices that will be integrated into the development process/product, and creating the conditions for permanent feedback to improve the product as well as the educational process. Thus, the research process is less driven on obtaining a descriptive knowledge; instead, it is more focused on the need to get, from the feedback on the tasks and the product development, information about how different aspects of the problem can be solved. According to our research plan, we firstly review the state of the art, following a systematic review [9], which is “designed to locate, appraise and synthesize the best available evidence relating to a specific research question to provide informative and evidence-based answers” [10]. Secondly, and after accessing the relationship between course design in e-Learning with attrition and dropout in previous step, we propose a decision-making model for an implementation prototype. Third, the prototype is tested and improved based on data collected, including attrition and dropout. Fourth, a functional product is released, providing the necessary mechanics for improvement based on continuous data collection.
