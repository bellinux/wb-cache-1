5|$|In {{the annual}} Thanksgiving Program, the students, in {{identical}} brown capes, silently construct a large <b>cornucopia</b> {{of fruits and}} vegetables in a ceremony choreographed to music prepared by each class. The food is later donated to the Salvation Army. It is the most treasured of the school traditions, and has been performed every year, virtually unchanged, since 1929.|$|E
5|$|The earguards are in {{the shape}} of silver ears, and the neckguard is {{decorated}} with a scrolling leaf pattern. Six detached cheekpieces were found within the helmet bowl along with the disintegrated remains of a seventh, although only two would have been needed. Hinges were also found, as was the pin of one cheekpiece, which had been bent. It may have been forcibly removed or possibly sustained damage at a later date, perhaps from a plough. It is unclear why there were so many cheekpieces accompanying the helmet; it is possible that they may all have been used on the same helmet to customise its appearance on different occasions, or alternatively they may have been intended as spares in the event of damage. The surviving cheekpieces are very elaborate. Five of the cheekpieces show equestrian scenes; one depicts the triumph of a Roman emperor on horseback, holding his arm in the air as he is crowned with a laurel wreath by the goddess Victoria (Victory). A cowering barbarian is depicted below being trampled by the hooves of the emperor's horse. Another less well-preserved cheekpiece depicts a possibly Middle Eastern figure holding a large <b>cornucopia,</b> and a Roman helmet and shield below.|$|E

25|$|Haymitch persuades Crane {{to change}} the rules to allow two winners {{provided}} they are from the same district in an attempt to save both Katniss and Peeta, suggesting that this will quiet the unrest. Katniss searches for Peeta after the announcement, finding him gravely wounded. Another announcement tells the remaining tributes that what each survivor needs the most will be provided at the <b>Cornucopia</b> the next morning. Despite Peeta's strong opposition, Katniss leaves to get medicine for him. At the <b>Cornucopia,</b> she is ambushed by Clove. Thresh, District 11's male tribute, kills Clove, then spares Katniss for helping Rue. Katniss returns with the medicine to Peeta, after which he is healed.|$|E
5000|$|Melaleuca <b>cornucopiae</b> {{was first}} {{formally}} described by Norman Byrnes in 1984 in Austrobaileya. The specific epithet (<b>cornucopiae)</b> {{is from the}} Latin word meaning [...] "horn of plenty", referring to the horn-like appearance of the flower spike.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the therapeutic role of the ethanolic extract of Pleurotus <b>cornucopiae</b> on sodium arsenite induced nephrotoxicity in rats. Sodium arsenite at the dose of 8 mg·kg– 1 body weight orally caused renal damage in rats as manifested by the significant rise in serum levels of serum urea, uric acid and creatinine level compared with control. Ethanolic ex-tracts of P. <b>cornucopiae</b> (400 mg·kg– 1 body weight per day) was administered orally for 30 days to sodium arsenite pre-treated rats. The results show significant decrease in the serum urea, uric acid and creatinine levels {{in comparison to the}} arsenic treated denotes the nephroprotective ef-fect of P. <b>cornucopiae</b> against sodium arsenite induced toxicity. Furthermore, it also possesses an-tioxidant effect as lipid peroxidation (MDA) levels decreased in P. <b>cornucopiae</b> treated group in comparison to arsenic treated group. Thus, the present study reveals that P. <b>cornucopiae</b> posse-sses nephroprotective as well as antioxidant property against arsenic induced toxicity...|$|R

25|$|In Greek mythology, the {{constellation}} is sometimes identified as Amalthea, the goat that suckled the infant Zeus after his mother, Rhea, saved {{him from being}} devoured by his father, Cronos. The goat's broken horn was transformed into the <b>cornucopia</b> or horn of plenty. Capricornus is also sometimes identified as Pan, the god with a goat's head, who saved himself from the monster Typhon by giving himself a fish's tail and diving into a river.|$|E
25|$|Bona Dea's cults in {{the city}} of Rome were led by the Vestal Virgins, and her provincial cults by virgin or matron priestesses. Surviving {{statuary}} shows her as a sedate Roman matron with a <b>cornucopia</b> and a snake. Personal dedications to her are attested among all classes, especially plebeians, freedmen and women, and slaves.

25|$|Morimono {{designs are}} relics of Buddhist traditions of laying flower and fruit offerings, {{especially}} during the harvest season. This is much like Thanksgiving in the United States, but instead of using a <b>cornucopia</b> or a horn of plenty, artists use an Ikebana container. Containers can be a basket, a wooden structure, a tray, or a typical suiban, or an upright container. Contemporary Morimono is typically designed with fruit, fruit and flowers, fruit and vegetables, vegetables, or vegetables and flowers. Morimono style captivates beauty {{through the use of}} minimum flowers and materials.|$|E
25|$|Several metal figurines {{are found}} {{that could be}} {{attributed}} to the Satavahanas. A hoard of unique bronze objects were also found from Bramhapuri. Numerous articles obtained from there were Indian but also had Roman and Italian tastes to it. A small statue of Poseidon, wine jugs, plaque depicting Perseus and Andromeda were also obtained from the house from where the objects were found. The fine elephant in Ashmolean museum and Yaksi image in British museum the <b>cornucopia</b> found in Posheri, kept at Prince of Wales Museum can also be attributed to the Satavahana period.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{breakthroughs}} in molecular, cell, evolutionary, and developmental biology generated a <b>cornucopia</b> of data-based theory relevant to cognition. Categorical assignments were problematic. For example, {{the decision to}} append cognitive to a body of biological research on neurons, e.g. the cognitive biology of neuroscience, is separate from the decision to put such body of research in a category named cognitive sciences. No less difficult a decision needs be made—between the computational and constructivist approach to cognition, and the concomitant issue of simulated v. embodied cognitive models—before appending biology to a body of cognitive research, e.g. the cognitive science of artificial life.|$|E

50|$|P. <b>cornucopiae</b> {{is quite}} similar to the {{well-known}} food mushroom Pleurotus ostreatus, being distinguished because in the latter case, the gills are not very decurrent and the cap colour is slate or bluish grey. Another species, Pleurotus pulmonarius has a comparable cap colour to P. <b>cornucopiae</b> but the gills on the stipe are similar to P. ostreatus.|$|R
25|$|In later years, theatre in Portugal has {{developed}} into many other forms {{as in any}} other European country. Almost every repertoire {{can be seen in}} Portugal. Many companies have the works of Shakespeare, Molière, Brecht, Becket or Chekhov, and Portuguese classic and modern authors on their repertoire. Other companies show more experimental projects. All this makes the theatre repertoire very varied. Some of the most important professional theatre companies nowadays are: Teatro da <b>Cornucópia,</b> Teatro da Comuna, Teatro Aberto, Teatro Meridional, Teatro da Garagem, Companhia de Teatro de Almada, Companhia Teatral do Chiado, A Barraca, Teatro dos Aloés, Teatro Praga, Artistas Unidos, Seiva Trupe, As boas raparigas, ACTA, among many others.|$|E
25|$|In 1870 Sam and Lou Blonger, {{along with}} many of the Livingstons, left the Midwest for the western frontier. Following the path of the newly {{completed}} Transcontinental Railroad, they briefly ran a hotel and saloon in Red Oak, Iowa, before moving on to Salt Lake City, Utah and the nearby mining towns of Stockton and Dry Canyon. In a pattern that repeated itself at many of their stops, Lou owned and operated saloons with assorted entertainments while Sam developed mining claims in the surrounding mountains, served occasionally as a peace officer and, in his spare time, raced horses. Similar stops followed in Virginia City, Nevada; <b>Cornucopia,</b> Nevada; Silver Reef, Utah; and again in Salt Lake City.|$|E
25|$|Monterey is {{well known}} for the {{abundance}} and diversity of its marine life, which includes sea lions, sea otters, harbor seals, bat rays, kelp forests, pelicans and dolphins and several species of whales. Only a few miles offshore is the Monterey Canyon, the largest and deepest (3.2km) underwater canyon off the Pacific coast of North America, which grants scientists access to the deep sea within hours. The <b>cornucopia</b> of marine life makes Monterey a popular destination for scuba divers of all abilities ranging from novice to expert. Scuba classes are held at San Carlos State Beach, which has been a favorite with divers since the 1960s. Monterey is home to one of the largest aquariums in North America, namely the Monterey Bay Aquarium, as well as several marine science laboratories, including Hopkins Marine Station.|$|E
