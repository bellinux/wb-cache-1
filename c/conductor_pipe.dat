40|$|<b>Conductor</b> <b>pipes</b> are {{the first}} part of an oil well to provide the initial {{structural}} foundation and they are normally installed into the ground by using impact hammers both onshore and offshore before any drilling operation. However, it is possible that <b>conductor</b> <b>pipes</b> do not reach the design depth and therefore relief drilling is needed. Nowadays offshore relief drilling is performed by using drill strings with drill bit of jack-up rigs. However, this operation is both time-consuming and expensive. This paper analyzes the use of an alternative solution, developed for supporting the installation of <b>conductor</b> <b>pipes.</b> Two mathematical cutting models were used to theoretically assess the net relief drilling time based on two geotechnical parameters, i. e. cohesion and friction angle. By comparing the theoretical results with three drill logs of an offshore project performed in the UK with another drill rig with similar geometries, it is shown that the preliminary models seem to match the net drilling time registered on the field. The results shown in this paper have to be carefully interpreted and cannot be applied to future projects as the net drilling time values have to be considered as theoretical...|$|R

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of ground return current in fault occurrence {{plays a key}} role in the dimensioning of the earthing grid of substations and of cable sealing end compounds, in the computation of rise of earth potential at substation sites and in electromagnetic interference (EMI) on neighbouring parallel metallic <b>conductors</b> (<b>pipes,</b> handrails, etc.). Moreover, the ground return current evaluation is also important in steady-state regime since this stray current can be responsible for EMI and also for alternating current (AC) corrosion. In fault situations and under some assumptions, the ground return current value at a substation site can be computed by means of k-factors. The paper shows that these simplified and approximated approaches have a lot of limitations and only multiconductor analysis can show the ground return current behaviour along the cable (not only the two end values) both in steady-state regime and in short circuit occurrence (e. g., phase-to-ground and phase-to-phase-to-ground). Multiconductor cell analysis (MCA) considers the cable system in its real asymmetry without simplified and approximated hypotheses. The sensitivity of ground return current on circuit parameters (cross-bonding box resistances, substation earthing resistances, soil resistivity) is presented in the paper...|$|R

50|$|In the {{offshore}} drilling industry, the <b>conductor</b> <b>pipe</b> {{is set in}} the seabed, and is a key structural foundation for the subsea wellhead. When drilling an offshore well, a marine riser is connected to the well, and this is subjected to large environmental forces such as current and waves which are transferred to the conductor. The forces can be large and also cyclical which can potentially cause fatigue damage to the conductor, especially in harsh environmental conditions. A Conductor tensioner unit (CTU) can be used in shallow water on jackup rig to withstand such damaging forces.|$|E
50|$|The extra coil or helical {{resonator}} can {{be physically}} {{separated from the}} two close-coupled coils, which make up the master oscillator or driver section. The power from the master oscillator is fed to {{the lower end of}} the extra coil resonator through a large diameter electrical <b>conductor</b> or <b>pipe</b> to minimize corona discharge. The magnifying transmitter's base-driven extra coil behaves as a slow-wave helical resonator, the axial disturbance propagating at a velocity of less than 1% up to around 10% the speed of light in free space. The axial velocity of the resonator's charge-coupled electromagnetic field is established by the coil pitch and electrical charge propagation speed through the circuit.|$|R
5000|$|Waveguide is used at {{microwave}} (SHF) frequencies, {{at which}} {{other types of}} feedline have excessive power losses. A waveguide is a hollow metallic <b>conductor</b> or <b>pipe.</b> It can have a circular or square cross-section. Waveguide runs are often pressurized with nitrogen gas to keep moisure out. The RF signal travels through the pipe similarly to the way sound travels in a tube. The metal walls keep it from radiating energy outwards and also prevent interference from entering the waveguide. Because of the cost and maintenance waveguide entails, microwave antennas often have the output stage of the transmitter or the RF {{front end of the}} receiver located at the antenna, and the signal is fed to or from the antenna at a lower frequency, using coaxial cable.|$|R

30|$|To {{alleviate}} or even avoid casing failure issues, proper casings {{should be}} selected {{to be used}} for well completion. Use of correct size, type, and number of casing in the well construction is halfway to success of the design. In a whole design, the integrated casing, cementing, mud, and blowout prevention control program should be taken into consideration. There are generally four types of casings used in completion: <b>conductor</b> <b>pipe,</b> surface casing, intermediate casing, and production casing. In this research, we need to utilize the four types of casing for the design and to add an intermediate casing serving as a coal protection casing.|$|E
40|$|Abstract-EMFWorkstation 2. 5 is a {{collection}} of software modules that allows utility staff to estimate the ELF magnetic fields that result from transmission lines, primary and secondary distribution lines, service drops, grounding <b>conductors,</b> water <b>pipes,</b> and substation equipment such as buswork, power transformers, air-core reactors/wave traps, circuit breakers and capacitor banks. EMFWorkstation includes modules for estimating magnetic fields in residential environments (RESICALC) and in and around substations (SUBCALC). Modules for determining the electrical characteristics of one-, twoand three-phase circuits (Power Line Calculator) and estimating lateral profiles (ENVIRO) and twodimensional exposure (EXPOCALC) for electric and magnetic fields are also included. A newly added expert system module (EMFX) provides information about field sources, field management and field measurement. When used separately or together, these modules enable utility staff to estimate field exposures and facilitate the development of field management plans. This software runs under Microsoft ® Windows ™ and features a full graphical user interface (GUI) that includes CAD-style entry of electrical system components. Output can be presented in a variety of formats (surface maps, contour maps, profile plots and statistical tables). A database of transmission, distribution and grounding conductors that can accept user-specified configurations facilitates the retrieval and use of electrical system components. Complete editing capabilities allows modification and storage of existing models. I...|$|R
5000|$|Skin {{effect is}} the {{tendency}} of an alternating electric current (AC) to become distributed within a conductor such that the current density is largest near {{the surface of the}} conductor, and decreases with greater depths in the conductor. The electric current flows mainly at the [...] "skin" [...] of the conductor, between the outer surface and a level called the skin depth. The skin effect causes the effective resistance of the conductor to increase at higher frequencies where the skin depth is smaller, thus reducing the effective cross-section of the conductor. The skin effect is due to opposing eddy currents induced by the changing magnetic field resulting from the alternating current. At 60 Hz in copper, the skin depth is about 8.5 mm. At high frequencies the skin depth becomes much smaller. Increased AC resistance due to the skin effect can be mitigated by using specially woven litz wire. Because the interior of a large conductor carries so little of the current, tubular <b>conductors</b> such as <b>pipe</b> can be used to save weight and cost.|$|R
40|$|Although {{finite element}} (FE) methods are well {{established}} for modeling geotechnical problems in soil masses and soil-structure interaction, most prior research on large deformation problems {{has been limited}} to simplified assumptions on drainage conditions and constitutive behavior. This thesis investigates two large deformation problems in soft clay and proposes a methodology for performing coupled flow and deformation analyses with advanced effective stress models. The {{first part of the}} research focuses on realistic 3 -D finite element analyses (using AbaqusTM Standard) of a <b>conductor</b> (steel <b>pipe</b> pile) embedded within soft marine clay subjected to large lateral deformations caused by drift/drive-off of a drilling vessel. The proposed analyses use coupled pore pressure-displacement procedures together with the MIT-E 3 soil model to represent the anisotropic, non-linear and inelastic effective stress-strain-strength properties of deepwater marine sediments with input parameters derived from a series of laboratory element tests performed on reconstituted Gulf of Mexico (GoM) clay. The numerical predictions are evaluated through comparison with experimental results from centrifuge tests with a well-instrumented model conductor. The FE results accurately predict the measured bending moment distribution {{along the length of the}} conductor and the spread of plastic strains within the conductor itself. The study has also shown the effects of soil behavior on local pile-soil interactions, enabling simplified analyses using macro-elements. The FE results have been used to calibrate input parameters for BWGG framework (Gerolymos & Gazetas, 2005), the Bouc-Wen (BW) model extended by Gerolymos and Gazetas (GG), that simulates generalized hysteretic pile-soil interactions and allows for degradation in soil resistance associated with geometric non-linearities. The second application considers the effects of partial drainage for large deformation, quasi-static piezocone penetration in clay. The proposed axisymmetric FE analysis procedure introduces automated remeshing and solution mapping technique (similar to RITSS; Hu & Randolph, 1998) within a commercial FE solver. We have analyzed the penetration resistance for a piezocone device using two elasto-plastic soil models (MCC, MIT-E 3) and the recent elasto-viscoplastic MIT-SR soil model (Yuan, 2016) over a range of steady penetration velocities. The MCC predictions are in very good agreement with laboratory measurements of tip resistance and penetration pore pressures measured in centrifuge model tests in reconstituted kaolin. The results from more advanced soil models illustrate the impacts of anisotropic, rate dependent soil behavior on penetration tests in natural clays and are within the range of empirical measurements. The proposed analyses provide a complete framework that can now be used to investigate effects of partial drainage that occurs in piezocone tests for soils (such as silts) of intermediate permeability. by Zhandos Y.

40|$|The {{following}} paper {{deals with}} the prediction of the theoretical net drilling time for a <b>conductor</b> <b>pipe</b> (CP) of offshore platforms when it plugs. The CP is driven to prevent the looser surface layer from caving in and obstructing the wellbore, because the shallow section of most wells on- and offshore is drilled in unconsolidated sediment. Due to the small CP diameter, the CP plugs very often. Normally the material is drilled out by using jetting, normal drill rigs and sometimes jack-up rigs. As offshore operations time is very important, this paper tries to assess the theoretical net time needed to excavate within the CP as a relief drilling operation, by means of Nishimatsu and Evans cutting theories. The results are compared with publicly available TBM excavation rates and then theoretical drilling rates for different unconfined compressive strength values for CP diameters of 700, 900 and 1000 mm are suggested. The results are considered for drag bits, however, they are only theoretical assumptions and cannot be applied for commercial projects with the same geotechnical properties...|$|E
30|$|The casing {{program is}} the most crucial feature that {{influences}} successful drilling operations and the longevity of the future geothermal fluid production. It implies assessing casing setting depths, a number of casing strings, nominal casing weight, casing material, type of connections and well completion. The main functions of casing programs are preventing casing deformation, supporting blow-out preventers and permanent wellhead, containing drilling and production fluids, preventing groundwater contamination, mitigating drilling fluid losses, protecting wells from corrosion, fracturing and erosion, preventing inter-zonal cross-contamination of geothermal fluids, defining a production zone and providing access to the reservoir (New Zealand Standard 2015). Conventional high-temperature (also called high-enthalpy) geothermal wells consist usually of three–four cemented casing strings. The typical casing program for most geothermal wells incorporates a <b>conductor</b> <b>pipe,</b> a surface casing, an intermediate casing which may serve as an anchor casing (i.e., casing string to which wellhead is attached), a production casing and an optional perforated liner (holed or slotted). All of these casing strings mentioned are cemented from casing shoe to top of casing string to prevent corrosion resulting from migration of reservoir fluids and to control thermal expansion during fluid production. A liner pipe, which is either suspended from a liner hanger or set at the well bottom, is usually left uncemented in the production section of the well. The completion is finalized by assembling a permanent wellhead {{at the top of}} the well. In most cases, it includes an expansion spool placed directly below the first master valve, which allows for expansion of the uppermost parts of the production casing string with respect to the anchor casing to which the permanent wellhead is attached.|$|E
