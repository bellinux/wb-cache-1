50|$|The Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) of the European Union, {{also called}} the {{financial}} perspective, is a seven-year framework regulating its annual budget. It is laid down in a unanimously adopted Council Regulation {{with the consent of}} the European Parliament. The financial framework sets the maximum amount of spendings in the EU budget each year for broad policy areas ("headings") and fixes an overall annual ceiling on payment and <b>commitment</b> <b>appropriations.</b>|$|E
40|$|With {{a view to}} {{increasing}} the effectiveness with which the Community Structural Funds are used, the Council regulation establishing general provisions on the Structural Funds provides {{for the implementation of}} a performance reserve. The amount of this reserve is set at 4 % of the <b>commitment</b> <b>appropriations.</b> The Italian government has considered the performance reserve as a key element of the set of rules that will govern implementation of Community Structural Funds for the period 2000 - 2006 in Objective 1 areas. On this basis, it has decided to add up to the 4 % reserve requested by regulations a 6 % performance reserve. The latter is conceived as a tool to strengthen administrative and institutional reform and the effectiveness of public spending on local development. The resulting 10 % reserve represents an adequate incentive to enhance the quality of the programming process and the effectiveness of public investment. A technical proposal for the implementation of the reserve was produced and partiall...|$|E
40|$|This {{collection}} of studies analyses {{the various ways}} and means that the financial system of the European Union has at its disposal for handling the inevitable uncertainties {{of the future and}} traces their evolution since the creation of the general budget of the European Communities in 1968. Special attention is paid to the consequences of this evolution not only for the various actors involved – namely the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission and Member States – but also for the financial system of the European Union as a whole. The question of the uncertainty of the future is addressed {{in the light of the}} theory of “Budgetary Flexibility”, which posits an essential distinction between “External Flexibility and “Internal Flexibility, on the one hand, and “Annual Flexibility“ and “Multiannual Flexibility“ on the other. External Flexibility differs from Internal Flexibility in that, in the case of the former, more resources (or fewer, in the case of budget cuts) can be allocated in the course of the budgetary year. In the case of the latter, budget limits (frames) are maintained, i. e. a reallocation of resources during the financial year will not lead to the growth in the overall size of the budget. At the same time, Multiannual Flexibility differs from Annual Flexibility in that the former can be considered as an exception to the principle of budgetary annuality as set out by the EC and EU Treaties. The theory of “Budgetary Flexibility” allows to place under a common theoretical framework processes that are often considered separate (and treated in the academic literature as such), and also enables to analyse the pros and cons and the consequences of such flexibility, and to draw conclusions at the level of the European Union. The studies also develop further the theory, devised originally in the 1990 s to analyse the budgetary systems of the Member States. The studies focus on three recent major negotiations which led to the Financial Regulation of 25 June 2002, to its first modification, adopted on 13 December 2006, and to the Interinstitutional Agreement (IIA) of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management and to the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for 2007 - 2013. The main forms of flexibility identified in the studies are: the system of amending budgets, the quantity of various budget headings and ”operational” budget lines in the general budget and the system of transfer of appropriations during the budgetary year (”structural flexibility”), the system of compulsory vs non-compulsory expenditure (”normative flexibility”), the system of provisional appropriations, reserves and Funds, the system of <b>commitment</b> <b>appropriations,</b> the system of carry-overs, and the various flexibility elements present in budgetary discipline system and the multiannual financial perspectives and framework of the European Union...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this global-city 1, {{which has}} been {{established}} since the XXth century and where everything is in a continuous and productive interaction, territories run out in this remarkable urban development. Otherwise, the urban growth is not a systematic process. These limits are particularly visible then specific events of the contemporary society: economic and environmental crisis, demographic transition or the fall of politic systems. In certain cases, they engender a negative urban growth of territories 2. Since the 1990 's, {{more than a quarter}} of the cities of 100 000 inhabitants are in this situation 3 and their numbers are increasing. Named shrinking cities 4 or shrinking region 5, they know "a decrease of demographic and economic indicators, with their social effects indisputably linked" 6. Consumed territories until then find themselves under-exploited, even totally abandoned transforming the townscape. What future for these territories? How to approach them? How to recapture them and to implement it? The aim of this article is to explore the limits of the consumer society on territories thought the example of the shrinkage process with the specific eye of the architect 7. Methodologies, knowledges and tools of project are entirely called into question in this context; they are formed to answer at logics of growth. The study focuses especially on spatial consequences of this process and has to initiate a reflection about possible salvage modes of territories (protection, optimization, recycling, land and natural reserving, etc.). A new consideration must be carried on these territories which are no more desired objects of consumption, but deserted by the inhabitants and economic structures. The article is based on the first elements identified stemming from the analysis work of my PhD research. Cases studies, in the process of definition, are European territories with varied spatial morphologies and sizes, and whose causes of shrinkage are different. Another criterion will be integrated: the political <b>commitment</b> for the <b>appropriation</b> of these territories. Various experiences emerge since about ten years: like the "urban marketing" with Saint-Etienne; or no aggressive approaches whose the aim is to improve the living environment of the population before any pump-priming such as many examples in Germany. Even if shrinking cities begin "to be integrated as a clincher of the evolution coming from territories, societies and activities which blind them" 8, some public authorities deny still them. Shrinking cities are yet veritable lands of spontaneous innovations and news roles appear for architects and urban planners...|$|R
