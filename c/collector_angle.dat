Analyzing the gravity-induced deformation of mirror shape for different mirror angles is relevant for performance calculation of solar parabolic trough collectors and identifying optimization potential of the mirror panels. Two mirror model cases (stiff and elastic supports) are evaluated in four angles: in horizontal laboratory angle (mirrors facing upward with mounting points horizontally aligned), and in 0 deg, 45 deg, and 90 deg <b>collector</b> <b>angle.</b> The resulting slope maps are calculated in a separate postprocessing. In order to evaluate the effect of gravity load on mirror shape, the deformed mirror in each evaluated angle is compared to the nondeformed mirror shape, and to the shapes in 0 deg (zenith) <b>collector</b> <b>angle,</b> respectively. The resulting slope deviation maps show the mirror deformation in different mirror angles. Stiffness of the mounting to the support structure has a relevant impact. Mirror deformation on elastic brackets (SDx up to 1. 6 mrad) is much more pronounced than on an ideal stiff support structure (SDx up to 1. 0 mrad) ...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that the high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) {{technique}} in scanning transmission electron microscopy is an incoherent imaging process in the lateral (xy) plane. However, {{as a consequence of the}} existence of partial coherence in the z direction, accurate quantitative interpretation of image intensity is difficult. The effects of coherence in the z direction can be reduced by increasing the inner <b>collector</b> <b>angle</b> of the annular detector so that the scattering from atoms in the z direction is essentially incoherent. We thus show that it is feasible to quantify the total As concentration of ultrathin InAsxP 1 –x layers in InP in a simple but accurate way using a thickness integrated Bloch wave calculation including phonon scattering with a large inner <b>collector</b> <b>angle</b> of the annular detector of around 150 mrad. We compare the As composition derived from this approach with that from the Fresnel method and high resolution imaging. We also show that the non-linear variation of the HAADF intensity with thickness is consistent with our simpler simulations for such conditions. Therefore, this approach enables us easily and quickly to quantify compositions using HAADF images. The tetra-gonal distortion due to lattice mismatch is also shown to influence the contrast and has been included in the calculations...|$|E

This paper reports on a heat transfer model that is used to compare the performance of a conventional {{solar chimney power plant}} (CSCPP) and two sloped solar chimney power plants (SSCPPs) with the collector oriented at 30 degrees and 60 degrees, respectively. The power generation from SCPPs at different latitudes in China is also analyzed. Results indicate that the larger solar <b>collector</b> <b>angle</b> leads to improved performance in winter but results in lower performance in summer. It is found that the optimal <b>collector</b> <b>angle</b> to achieve the maximum power in Lanzhou, China, is around 60 degrees. Main factors that influence the performance of SCPPs also include the system height and the air thermophysical characteristics. The ground energy loss, reflected solar radiation, and kinetic loss at the chimney outlet are the main energy losses in SCPPs. The studies also show SSCPPs are more suitable for high latitude regions in Northwest China, but CSCPPs are suggested to be built in southeastern and eastern parts of China with the combination to the local agriculture.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} achieve high optical {{collector}} and therefore high solar field efficiencies parabolic trough concentrators in concentrating solar power plants need to maintain their parabolic shape during operation. Additional to shape deviation already induced by the manufacturing process, deformation due to gravity load is an inevitable factor influencing shape accuracy in all types of parabolic trough collectors. This paper characterizes and quantifies the effect of gravity load on mirror shape and resulting slope and focus deviation values. One inner and one outer ideally parabolic shaped mirror of RP 3 geometry mounted onto different support structures are evaluated in finite element analyses for all collector angles relevant for operation. The different support structures include two idealized support structures (ideal and elastic case) and one structure including relevant parts of EuroTrough type collectors (cantilever case). Constructional design and stiffness of the support structure significantly determine characteristic and magnitude of deformation. If compared to non-deformed shape, resulting rms values are as high as SDx = 1. 7 mrad and FDx = 6. 3 mm (inner mirror, elastic case) and SDx = 1. 1 mrad and FDx = 5. 6 mm (outer mirror, cantilever case). Depending {{on the type of}} support structure, minimum and maximum values occur at different collector angles. If compared to 0 ° (zenith) <b>collector</b> <b>angle,</b> resulting rms slope and focus deviation values are on average smaller than if compared to non-deformed mirror shape.

In addition to shape imperfections introduced by the manufacturing process, deformation due to gravity load and mounting forces is an inevitable factor affecting shape accuracy in all types of parabolic trough collectors. In this paper the effect of gravity load on mirror shape and resulting slope and focus deviation values is characterized and quantified in finite element analyses referenced to specific lab tests.

40|$|The present thesis {{examines}} {{the influence of}} measurement parameters and boundary conditions on shape accuracy of parabolic trough concentrator mirrors of RP 3 geometry by means of optical measurements and finite element analyses. Deflectometric measurements of mirror panels are performed in common laboratory setups: in vertical and horizontal measurement position, both with and without tightening the mirrors to a support frame with screws. The results serve for validation of finite element models which are applied to calculate the difference in shape accuracy between, firstly, the individual setups and secondly, between mirrors horizontally fixed to differently rigid support frames. The effect of angular deviations of the mounting pads is assessed. Gravity-induced deformation of mirrors mounted to two exemplary collector support structures is determined for the relevant working positions. The transferability of shape accuracy data measured in laboratory to data applying for mirrors mounted to a collector is assessed. For RP 3 inner mirror panels a difference of up to 0. 8 mrad in root mean square slope deviation (SDx) and 3. 3 mm in root mean square focus deviation (FDx) from vertical to horizontal position is measured. Gravity-induced deformation and resulting slope and focus deviation on three different types of horizontally oriented support frames is modeled: an ideally rigid support frame, a laboratory support frame, and an ideal support frame with elastic brackets. A variation of 0. 5 mrad (SDx) and 1. 8 mm (FDx) is calculated for perfectly shaped RP 3 inner mirrors mounted onto an ideally rigid support frame compared to the case when mounted to a support frame with elastic brackets. In case of an angular deviation of the mounting pads mirror panels fixed to an ideally rigid support frame show additional local slope deviation in {{the magnitude of the}} angular pad deviation. Due to gravity-induced deformation and slope deviation the shape accuracy of RP 3 inner mirrors mounted to an ideally rigid collector support structure varies up to 1. 0 mrad in SDx and up to 1. 2 mrad in SDx when compared to the ideal shape and the shape in zenith <b>collector</b> <b>angle,</b> respectively. For RP 3 inner mirrors mounted to a collector structure with elastic brackets the values are 1. 6 mrad and 2. 1 mrad. Whereas the models of mirrors mounted to a laboratory support frame allow for a conversion and thus a comparison of results obtained in different setups, the models for the collector support structure need to be refined in order to allow for a conversion from laboratory to collector measurement results. The results demonstrate that measurement position, mounting mode and employed support structure have to be documented in order to obtain reproducible measurement results. They should hence be included as measurement boundary conditions in guidelines for the measurement and assessment of mirror shape accuracy for concentrating solar collectors. The inspection of the angular accuracy of the mounting pads is part of a complete optical mirror assessment. The data of standardized shape accuracy measurement serve for subsequent calculation of intercept factors and annual energy yields {{as well as for the}} evaluation of optimization approaches...|$|E

By comparison of both photon fluxes a reduction of the emission in the appropriate ranges of wavelength and angle by a factor > 10 is observed. For photovoltaic applications an increase in the internal photon density of the collector and likewise in the fluorescence photon flux fed to a solar cell can be expected, which might be overcompensated by the non-negligible reflection of the opal...|$|R
40|$|The {{calculation}} of heat loss from the collector to its surroundings {{is required for}} the design or simulation of the performance of solar collectors. In the present work numerical solutions of the heat balance equations for single glazed flat plate collectors are found using computer program. The value of top heat loss factor (Ut) obtained from the numerical solutions of heat balance equations are compared to the values obtained by using the various correlations available in the literature. The percentage error in the {{calculation of}} top heat loss factor (and hence the useful energy) of a single glazed flat plate solar collector obtained by using different correlations of Ut as compared to the numerical solutions of heat balance equations are compared for the wide range of variables: 323 - 423 K in absorber plate temperature, 273 - 318 K for ambient temperature, 10 - 50 mm in air gap spacing, 5 - 45 W m- 2 K- 1 for wind heat transfer coefficient, 0 - 70 º <b>collector</b> tilt <b>angle</b> and absorber plate emittance 0. 1 - 0. 95. The study shows that the empirical relations of Ut predict the values close to numerical solutions only for certain assumed conditions and cause large errors in the calculation of top heat loss factor and useful energy for other range of variables...|$|R
40|$|A {{performance}} {{model has}} been programmed for solar thermal collector based on a linear, tracking parabolic trough reflector focused on a surface-treated metallic pipe receiver enclosed in an evacuated transparent tube: a Parabolic Trough Solar Collector (PTSC). This steady state, single dimensional model comprises the fundamental radiative and convective heat transfer and mass and energy balance relations programmed in the Engineering Equation Solver, EES. It considers the effects of solar intensity and incident <b>angle,</b> <b>collector</b> dimensions, material properties, fluid properties, ambient conditions, and operating conditions {{on the performance of}} the collector: the PTSC. Typical performance calculations show that when hot-water at 165 C flows through a 6 m by 2. 3 m PTSC with 900 w/m^ 2 solar insulation and 0 incident <b>angle,</b> the estimated <b>collector</b> efficiency is about 55 % The model predictions will be confirmed by the operation of PTSCs now being installed at Carnegie Mellon...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{efficiently}} {{solve the problems}} created by the deepening energy crisis affecting Europe and the world, governments cannot neglect the opportunities of using the energy produced by sun collectors. In many of the EU countries there are sun collectors producing heat energy, e. g. in Austria more than 3, 500, 000 m 2 and in Germany more than 12, 000, 000 m 2 of sun collectors are operated [5]. The energy produced by these sun collectors is utilized at the place of production. In the near future governments will have {{to focus more on}} spreading and using sun collectors. Among the complex problems of operating sun collectors, this article deals with determining the optimal tilt <b>angle</b> of sun <b>collectors.</b> The tilt <b>angles</b> which we determined theoretically are confirmed by laboratory measurements. The result of our work will help users and engineers to determine the optimal operation of sun collectors...|$|R
40|$|The annual gain of {{stationary}} {{solar thermal}} collectors {{can be increased}} by non-focusing reflectors. Such concentrators make use of diffuse irradiance. A <b>collector’s</b> incidence <b>angle</b> modifier for diffuse (diffuse-IAM) accounts for this utilization. The diffuse irra-diance varies over the collector hemisphere, which dynamically influences the diffuse-IAM. This is not considered by state-of-the-art collector models. They simply calculate with one constant IAM value for isotropic diffuse irradiance from sky and ground. This work {{is based on the}} development of a stationary, double-covered process heat flat-plate collector with a one-sided, segmented booster reflector (RefleC). This reflector approximates one branch of a compound parabolic concentrator (CPC). Optical meas-urement results of the collector components as well as raytracing results of different variants are given. The thermal and optical characterization of test samples up to 190 [*]°C in an outdoor laboratory as well as the validation of the raytracing are discussed. A collector simulation model with varying diffuse-IAM is described. Therein, ground reflected and sky diffuse irradiance are treated separately. Sky diffuse is weighted with an anisotropic IAM, which is re-calculated in every time step. This is realized by gener-ating an anisotropic sky radiance distribution with the model of Brunger and Hooper, and by weighting the irradiance from distinct sky elements with their raytraced beam-IAM values. According to the simulations, the RefleC booster increases the annual out-put of the double-covered flat-plate in Würzburg, Germany, by 87 [*]...|$|R
