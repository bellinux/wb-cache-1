40|$|The paper {{sets out}} by contextually situating in its basic {{characteristics}} {{the share of}} the Šokac <b>Croatians</b> among the Vojvodina <b>Croatians</b> as a whole {{at the turn of the}} century, primarily in their demographic, spatial and territorial, and historical segment. This is followed by an outline of the individual social processes to which the Šokac <b>Croatians</b> in Vojvodina have been exposed, on the one hand, and those that they themselves have produced on the other. Analysis of the social position of the Šokac <b>Croatians</b> in Vojvodina is orientated to two major issues. One is related to the consequences upon them of the war that the Milošević regime waged against the Republic of Croatia, and the fate of steps undertaken towards the creation of a separate “Šokac nation”, which was also conceived and generated by the Milošević regime. The second group of issues that the author deals with includes the contemporary history of the political organising of the Šokac <b>Croatians,</b> that of the area of culture and, finally, of the domain of information and education. Along with those segments of the contemporary history of the Šokac <b>Croatians</b> in the Vojvodinian part of the Danube River Basin, comparisons are drawn with the same or similar processes among other sub-ethnic groups of Vojvodina <b>Croatians,</b> particularly the Bunjevci <b>Croatians,</b> and those from other regions in Vojvodina in which ethnic <b>Croatians</b> live...|$|R

5|$|After World War II, Croatia {{became a}} one-party Socialist federal {{unit of the}} Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Croatia was ruled by the Communists and enjoyed a degree of {{autonomy}} within the Yugoslav federation. In 1967, a group of <b>Croatian</b> authors and linguists published the Declaration on the Status and Name of the <b>Croatian</b> Literary Language, demanding greater autonomy for the <b>Croatian</b> language. The declaration contributed to a national movement seeking greater civil rights and decentralization of the Yugoslav economy, culminating in the <b>Croatian</b> Spring of 1971, which was suppressed by Yugoslav leadership. The 1974 Yugoslav Constitution gave increased autonomy to federal units, essentially fulfilling a goal of the <b>Croatian</b> Spring and providing a legal basis for independence of the federative constituents.|$|E

5|$|After a bloodless {{skirmish}} between Serb {{insurgents and}} <b>Croatian</b> special police in March, the JNA itself, supported by Serbia and its allies, asked the Federal Presidency {{to give it}} wartime authorities and declare a state of emergency. The request was denied on 15 March, and the JNA came {{under the control of}} Serbian President Slobodan Milošević. Milošević, preferring a campaign to expand Serbia rather than to preserve Yugoslavia, publicly threatened to replace the JNA with a Serbian army and declared that he no longer recognized the authority of the Federal Presidency. By the end of the month, the conflict had escalated into the <b>Croatian</b> War of Independence. The JNA stepped in, increasingly supporting the <b>Croatian</b> Serb insurgents and preventing <b>Croatian</b> police from intervening. In early April, the leaders of the <b>Croatian</b> Serb revolt declared their intention to integrate the area under their control, known as SAO Krajina, with Serbia. The Government of Croatia viewed this declaration as an attempt to secede. In May, the <b>Croatian</b> government responded by forming the <b>Croatian</b> National Guard (Zbor narodne garde - ZNG), but its development was hampered by a United Nations (UN) arms embargo introduced in September. On 8 October, Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia.|$|E

5|$|Croatia {{suffered}} heavy {{military and}} civilian casualties. The <b>Croatian</b> side initially reported 1,798 killed in the siege, both soldiers and civilians. <b>Croatian</b> general Anton Tus later stated that about 1,100 <b>Croatian</b> soldiers were killed, and 2,600 soldiers and civilians were listed as missing. Another 1,000 <b>Croatian</b> soldiers were killed on the approaches to Vinkovci and Osijek, according to Tus. He noted that the fighting was so intense that losses in eastern Slavonia between September and November 1991 constituted half of all <b>Croatian</b> war casualties from that year. According to figures published in 2006 by the <b>Croatian</b> Ministry of Defence, 879 <b>Croatian</b> soldiers were killed and 770 wounded in Vukovar. The Central Intelligence Agency estimates <b>Croatian</b> casualties at around 4,000 to 5,000 dead across eastern Slavonia.

50|$|After {{disintegration}} of multinational states like Yugoslavia and Soviet Union, besides {{the process of}} renationalization of history, there is sometimes also retroactive nationalization of victims or tragedies {{of the people that}} in past lived in those states. According to new national historical narratives, the reason for some people were the victims of certain tragedies was because they were of a certain nationality, for example the Ukrainians of the Soviet Union. Nationalist discourse in Croatia presents the Bleiburg tragedy as an event where only <b>Croatians</b> suffered and died just because they were <b>Croatians,</b> eluding {{the fact that many of}} the victims were Serbs, Montenegrins or Slovenians while many <b>Croatians</b> had died while fighting as collaborators against Yugoslav partisans.|$|R
