5|$|On {{a garden}} scale, the berries should be picked when dry and ripe. Commercially, most {{harvesting}} is done mechanically by straddle harvesters. These move continually down the rows, straddling {{a row of}} bushes, shaking the branches and stripping off the fruit. The blackcurrants are placed into half tonne bins and to minimise stoppage time, some machines have cross <b>conveyors</b> which direct the fruit into continuously moving trailers in the adjoining row. A modern machine can pick up to fifty tonnes of blackcurrants in a day using only one operator and two tractor drivers. The bins should be stored in a cool place. Some fruit is still picked by hand {{for use in the}} fresh fruit market.|$|E

50|$|Vayeron is an Australian based {{company that}} has {{developed}} a hardware sensor device {{which is designed to}} be embedded within the <b>conveyor</b> roller itself. The Smart-Idler™ is an automated <b>conveyor</b> roller condition monitoring & prognostics technology that is embedded within <b>conveyor</b> rollers when they are manufactured. The device monitors bearing temperature, vibration, acoustics and roller shell-wear to predict <b>conveyor</b> roller failure. This ultimately makes <b>conveyor</b> roller condition monitoring more efficient and reduces operational downtime. The Smart-Idler™ sensor operates without batteries, taking its power directly from the rotation of the <b>conveyor</b> roller, using a dynamo style energy harvesting method as it turns whilst in operation within the <b>conveyor.</b> Companies that make <b>conveyor</b> rollers can integrate the Smart-Idler™ within their <b>conveyor</b> roller products to create an enhanced roller offering for their clients - the owners and operators of <b>conveyor</b> systems. The embedded sensors have a multi-modal monitoring capability. Parameters such as bearing temperature, vibration, acoustics and roller shell wear are monitored and analysed to determine roller condition deterioration and flag impending failure.|$|R

25|$|With {{gunpowder}} being increasingly {{applied to}} mining, rock chunks from a mining face became much larger, and the blast dependent mining itself had become dependent upon an organized group, {{not just an}} individual swinging a pick. Economies of scale gradually infused industrial enterprises, while transport became a key bottleneck as the volume of moved materials continued to increase following demand. This spurred numerous canal projects, inspired laying first wooden, then iron protected rails using draft animals to pull loads in the emerging bulk goods transportation dependent economy. In the coal industry, which grew up hand in hand as the preferred fuel for smelting ores, crushing and preparation (cleaning) was performed for {{over a hundred years}} in coal breakers, massive noisy buildings full of <b>conveyors,</b> belt-powered trip-hammer crushing stages and giant metal grading/sorting grates. Like mine pumps, the internal <b>conveyors</b> and trip-hammers contained within these 711 story buildings.|$|E
25|$|When coal seams {{are near}} the surface, it may be {{economical}} to extract the coal using open cut (also referred to as open cast, open pit, mountaintop removal or strip) mining methods. Open cast coal mining recovers {{a greater proportion of}} the coal deposit than underground methods, as more of the coal seams in the strata may be exploited. This equipment can include the following: Draglines which operate by removing the overburden, power shovels, large trucks in which transport overburden and coal, bucket wheel excavators, and <b>conveyors.</b> In this mining method, explosives are first used in order to break through the surface or overburden, of the mining area. The overburden is then removed by draglines or by shovel and truck. Once the coal seam is exposed, it is drilled, fractured and thoroughly mined in strips. The coal is then loaded onto large trucks or <b>conveyors</b> for transport to either the coal preparation plant or directly to where it will be used.|$|E

25|$|Blast mining or {{conventional}} mining, is {{an older}} practice that uses explosives such as dynamite {{to break up}} the coal seam, after which the coal is gathered and loaded onto shuttle cars or <b>conveyors</b> for removal to a central loading area.
