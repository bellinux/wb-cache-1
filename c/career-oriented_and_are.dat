40|$|Abstract Background The {{profile of}} the medical {{profession}} is changing in regard to feminization, attitudes towards the profession, and the lifestyle aspirations of young physicians. The issues addressed {{in this study are}} the careers of female and male physicians seven years after graduation and the impact of parenthood on career development. Methods Data reported originates from the fifth assessment (T 5) of the prospective SwissMedCareer Study, beginning in 2001 (T 1). At T 5 in 2009, 579 residents (81. 4 % of the initial sample at T 1) participated in the questionnaire survey. They were asked about occupational factors, career-related factors including specialty choice and workplace, work-life balance and life satisfaction. The impact of gender and parenthood on the continuous variables was investigated by means of multivariate and univariate analyses of variance; categorical variables were analyzed using Chi-square tests. Results Female physicians, especially those with children, have lower rates of employment and show lower values in terms of career success and career support experiences than male physicians. In addition, parenthood has a negative impact on these career factors. In terms of work-life balance aspired to, female doctors are less <b>career-oriented</b> <b>and</b> <b>are</b> more inclined to consider part-time work or to continue their professional career following a break to bring up a family. Parenthood means less career-orientation and more part-time orientation. As regards life satisfaction, females show higher levels of satisfaction overall, especially where friends, leisure activities, and income are concerned. Compared to their male colleagues, female physicians are less advanced in their specialty qualification, are less prone to choosing prestigious surgical fields, have a mentor less often, more often work at small hospitals or in private practice, aspire less often to senior hospital or academic positions and consider part-time work more often. Any negative impact on career path and advancement is exacerbated by parenthood, especially as far as women are concerned. Conclusion The {{results of the present study}} reflect socially-rooted gender role stereotypes. Taking into account the feminization of medicine, special attention needs to be paid to female physicians, especially those with children. At an early stage of their career, they should be advised to be more proactive in seeking mentoring and career-planning opportunities. If gender equity in terms of career chances is to be achieved, special career-support measures will have to be provided, such as mentoring programs, role models, flexitime and flexible career structures. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} job-related values among Norwegian business school students. The study is based on a survey conducted in 1999 in the three leading national business schools among students who had completed almost 3 years of the 4 -year degree program. We analyze the degree to which these values vary according to gender and social background. Previous research has indicated that business students <b>are</b> relatively materialistic <b>and</b> <b>career-oriented,</b> <b>and</b> that males <b>are</b> more so than females. However, in this paper, we find personal development to be the major motivational force among students of both genders. While the men are significantly more materialistic than the women, the difference is not very great. The analysis indicates that social background exerts no influence on job-related values.

50|$|Nelle {{is portrayed}} as an ambitious and {{confident}} young woman. Though well aware of her own beauty, she prefers to succeed based on her intelligence and merits as a litigator. She displays a sarcastic sense of humor <b>and</b> <b>is</b> a frequent source of biting, witty one-liners. Nelle’s nickname before joining Cage & Fish is “subzero,” as she is not known for her warmth as a person. Though her friend Ling’s viciousness is more commonly remarked upon, Nelle shares the same quality <b>and</b> can also <b>be</b> vindictive, if on a lesser scale. These traits come to the forefront in Season 3, both following her break-up with John Cage and during her attempt to start her own firm. Nelle is primarily a <b>career-oriented</b> woman <b>and</b> <b>is</b> somewhat unusual among the show’s female characters in that she expresses no desire to ever be a mother. She also has no serious long-term romantic relationships after Cage, both because she prefers to focus on work and because she dislikes sex. A softer side of Nelle {{can be seen on}} occasion, particularly during her relationship with Cage and in her friendship with her sole confidant, Ling, but also at various other points throughout the show. Ally herself notes in the series finale that Nelle has “a big heart,” but Nelle seems reluctant to expose it for fear of vulnerability.|$|R

This study looks at women's political participation from their role and influence in the bureaucracy, using the Philippines as a case study. The study focuses on women's public and private roles and posits that in the bureaucracy, women's public roles are disguised, but exist nevertheless. This study investigates this blurred area where women perform both public and private roles and analyzes how such women cope with their dual responsibilities. A survey of 89 women and 88 men in the Career Executive Service working in government offices in Metropolitan Manila was conducted in May-June 1983. The research yielded the following results: (1) Women in the bureaucracy are disadvantaged compared with the men. (2) Women in the study tend to have higher educational qualifications than the men in the sample. (3) There is not gender distinction as far as perceptions of influence in policy-making is concerned. (4) There is a significant difference between men and women in terms of perceptions of women's role priorities. More men think that women should give higher priority to the home rather than to their careers. (5) There are no differences in the perception among the women of their domestic and career roles, despite differences in ages and level of education. (6) Women's role conflict is not statistically related to number of children, religion, and urban-rural origin. What emerges from the study is that women in the highest levels in the Philippine bureaucracy <b>are</b> <b>career-oriented,</b> <b>and</b> may <b>be</b> different from the general female population as seen in previous studies on role stereotypes. Women perceive their active participation in policy formation and implementation, steps in the policy process which are important to politics. However, they are not aware that they are actively performing political roles, as gauged from the low priority the female respondents gave to women's participation in public affairs...|$|R

The career-oriented homemakers were the ones who expressed greater personal dissatisfaction than employed women.

40|$|Educational {{restructuring}} is {{an international}} phenomenon which emphasises a voucher system, upper secondary schools’ local decision-making and pupils’ choices in contrast to previous bureaucratic governing. For this reason upper secondary programmes and courses on offer, together with the pupils’ individual choices, have {{a direct impact on}} what could be called the upper-secondary education market. In terms of teaching subject matter, upper secondary education is, at the same time, broadened by means of introducing three-year programmes for all pupils as well as core subjects. The aim of this doctoral thesis is to develop a deeper understanding of how pupils’ actions of choice create different sorts of integration and differentiation processes within the restructured upper secondary education. In the light of Jürgen Habermas’ theory of communicative action combined with Norman Fairclough’s critical discourse analysis, pupils’ actions of choice have been studied within four pedagogical practices: (i) choice of upper secon-dary school, (ii) choice of upper secondary programme, (iii) pupils’ initial time at an upper secondary school and how they cope with the specific culture within a programme as well as choice of courses and subjects, and (iv) pupils’ own sto-ries and points of view on how a core subject, namely Swedish, was taught. Some of the results demonstrate that pupils’ actions of choice can <b>be</b> voca-tion-oriented, <b>career-oriented</b> <b>and</b> consumption-oriented. It <b>is</b> argued that these different types of actions of choice are constituted within a market discourse. The market discourse demands that pupils are able to make suitable choices to achieve an individualistic qualification. From that point of view upper secondary education’s integration and differentiation processes aim at developing citizens' personal opportunities {{in order for them to}} benefit to their best ability from what society has to offer. Other results demonstrate that pupils’ group-oriented, inter-est-oriented and tradition-oriented actions of choice are built upon another type of discourse, which is about educating pupils towards active citizenship. It has an inter-subjective point of departure. Pupils are driven into the integration and dif-ferentiation process where they discuss and take a stand in favour of those educa-tional options, which are conceived as the most relevant in relation to a “self-determining ethical-cultural community”. The analysis of these two paramount discourses indicates that pupils' integration <b>and</b> differentiation processes <b>are</b> am-biguous...|$|R

30|$|A {{sample of}} Bavarian {{university}} graduates {{was used to}} determine the frequency and effects of employer changes. The results show that women change employer more often than men, which may be largely due to the less favorable terms of their first jobs. Compared with men, women in their first job {{are less likely to be}} on a permanent contract, to hold an executive position and to work in a large company; they are also less satisfied with their first job. After controlling for variance in these and other factors, the algebraic sign of the gender coefficient in the regression model changed, indicating that men are more mobile when these variables are taken into account. Gender differences in preferences are one possible reason for this difference in mobility: If, as previous studies suggest, men <b>are</b> more <b>career-oriented</b> <b>and</b> prioritize income over job security one would expect them to display higher mobility because changing employer is one route to a career advancement and higher pay. This assumption could not, however, be tested with this sample, because information about individuals’ labor market preferences was not available. Additional research using different datasets is needed to address this question.|$|R
