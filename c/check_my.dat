500|$|At Fairbanks, {{the three}} B-29s {{encountered}} significant headwinds; {{more than the}} [...] "slight" [...] headwinds observed up to this time. They had expected tailwinds from the jet stream, yet could complete the distance without them, but headwinds meant that Washington might be too far. At 7am Eastern War Time, aircraft Number 2 was over Northway, Alaska, and navigator Bill Townes determined that they were behind schedule. He said later, [...] "When I reported that fact to General LeMay, {{he looked at me}} as if he thought it was my fault, so I retreated behind my bulkhead to <b>check</b> <b>my</b> figures." [...] Later, the airmen learned that the typhoon near Okinawa the week before had greatly affected the jet stream.|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1949, Robinson turned to Hall of Famer George Sisler, working as an advisor to the Dodgers, for batting help. At Sisler's suggestion, Robinson spent hours at a batting tee, {{learning}} {{to hit the ball}} to right field. Sisler taught Robinson to anticipate a fastball, on the theory that it is easier to subsequently adjust to a slower curveball. Robinson also noted that [...] "Sisler showed me how to stop lunging, how to <b>check</b> <b>my</b> swing until the last fraction of a second". The tutelage helped Robinson raise his batting average from [...]296 in 1948 to [...]342 in 1949. In addition to his improved batting average, Robinson stole 37 bases that season, was second place in the league for both doubles and triples, and registered 124 runs batted in with 122 runs scored. For the performance Robinson earned the Most Valuable Player Award for the National League. Baseball fans also voted Robinson as the starting second baseman for the 1949 All-Star Game—the first All-Star Game to include black players.|$|E

It's right there. It's just the irony of that {{and a little bit of}} sarcasm. And it's not putting this place down at all.

Donohue released a book to coincide with Saint Teresa's canonization, entitled [...] "Unmasking Mother Teresa's Critics".

But I actually have more footnotes than I have pages in the book. That’s because I want people to <b>check</b> <b>my</b> sources." ...|$|E
