5|$|Themes {{of class}} {{consciousness}} and conflict are {{also present in}} the book. Critics interpreted the stance the novel took against French <b>class-based</b> discrimination and hypocrisy as quite radical, although some French critics found that this made the novel an unsubtle satire of fading social stereotypes. There are also literary allusions in the novel, referencing comic books, movies, music, and paintings.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Disraeli adopted one-nation {{conservatism}} {{for both}} ethical and electoral reasons. Before he became {{leader of the}} Conservative Party, Disraeli had announced that, {{as a result of}} the Reform Act 1867 which had enfranchised the male working-class, the party needed to pursue social reforms if it were to have electoral success. One-nationism would both improve the conditions of the poor and portray the Liberal Party as selfish individualists. Because the party portrayed itself as a national (and not <b>class-based)</b> party, it's members were unsure whether to make specific appeals to the working-classes. A more positive approach to the working-class by the party developed later out of the electoral necessity to secure working-class votes.|$|E
5|$|Player characters' combat {{abilities}} and skills are dictated by a character <b>class-based</b> job system. The {{jobs in the}} initial launch were Warrior, Priest, Mage, Martial Artist, Thief, and Minstrel. Later updates added further jobs, such as the Beast Tamer and Dancer. Each job has a separate skill point system that allows customization, and jobs can be changed at dedicated temples found in each major town. Player characters can also adopt Trades, skills that include woodwork, weapon and armor forging among others. Each Trade skill requires materials gathered from the overworld, which are then {{used to create a}} specific type of equipment unique to the gathered materials and Trade. Weapons and items are acquired either in battle alongside in-game currency or through Guilds scattered through Bazaars located in major towns. Guilds will forge new gear, weapons and items for a combined fee of money and materials salvaged from the game world. Also found in towns are vendors where excess items can be stored, merchants which buy and sell various items, and tailor's establishments where the player character can gain new outfits.|$|E

25|$|The Shadowrun game {{mechanics}} {{are based}} entirely on a 6-sided dice system. The game is skill-based rather than <b>class-based,</b> but archetypes {{are presented in}} the main book to give players and gamemasters {{an idea of what}} is possible with the system.|$|E
25|$|At the 1988 election, Kirner {{shifted to}} the Legislative Assembly, {{becoming}} MP for Williamstown, and was promoted to the Education portfolio. In this portfolio Kirner carried {{out a series of}} controversial reforms aimed at reducing what Kirner saw as the <b>class-based</b> inequity of the education system, culminating in a new system of assessment, the Victorian Certificate of Education.|$|E
25|$|The {{differences}} between the two languages are more prominent than their similarities. Java has static typing, while JavaScript's typing is dynamic. Java is loaded from compiled bytecode, while JavaScript is loaded as human-readable source code. Java's objects are <b>class-based,</b> while JavaScript's are prototype-based. Finally, Java did not support functional programming until Java 8, while JavaScript has done so from the beginning, being influenced by Scheme.|$|E
25|$|While a class {{hierarchy}} {{is reflected in}} stratified housing structures, military classism differs from traditional class structures in some significant ways - namely, schooling and access to quality healthcare. Children of military personnel attend the same base schools regardless of rank, creating peer cultures that are usually not <b>class-based,</b> and providing equal access to educational resources. Similarly, all military personnel receive the same quality of healthcare by the same providers.|$|E
25|$|The school's first headmistress, Rosa Bassett, {{encouraged}} self-reliance {{and personal}} {{responsibility in the}} school's pupils. This pattern was deepened when, in 1920, Bassett introduced {{the use of the}} Dalton Plan to the school. The Dalton Plan was a system of education developed in Massachusetts by Helen Parkhurst which moved away from traditional, rigid, <b>class-based</b> teaching, allowing for teaching to be adjusted to the pace of each individual child.|$|E
25|$|English individualism {{developed}} hand in {{hand with}} legal equality. American self-reliance, on the other hand, has been inseparable from an insistence upon economic and social as well as political equality. The result is that a qualified individualism, with a qualified equality, has prevailed in England, but what has been considered the unalienable right of every American is unrestricted self-reliance and, at least ideally, unrestricted equality. The English, therefore, tend to respect <b>class-based</b> distinctions in birth, wealth, status, manners, and speech, while Americans resent them.|$|E
25|$|Cultural capital {{refers to}} assets, e.g., competencies, skills, qualifications, which enable holders to {{mobilise}} cultural authority {{and can also}} be a source of misrecognition and symbolic violence. For example, working class children can come to see the educational success of their middle-class peers as always legitimate, seeing what is often <b>class-based</b> inequality as instead the result of hard work or even 'natural' ability. A key part of this process is the transformation of people's symbolic or economic inheritance (e.g., accent or property) into cultural capital (e.g., university qualifications).|$|E
25|$|Year 1 {{students}} {{are sorted into}} houses by class. In {{the early years of}} RI's history, there were ten houses, including a sixth Philips house (purple), later disbanded. House allocations used to be student-based, instead of <b>class-based.</b> Each House is led by a House Captain, a Year 4 student, who carries out his role along with the respective House Committee. The Houses participate in inter-house tournaments and activities, notably including the annual Inter-House Sports Carnival, Dramafeste and the Inter-House Debate tournament, with points earned from each activity contributing to the House Championship which is awarded {{at the end of the}} school year.|$|E
25|$|In {{the states}} of Bavaria, Wurttemberg, Hesse, and Baden, the SPD was {{successful}} in extracting various socio-political and democratic concessions (including {{the replacement of the}} <b>class-based</b> electoral systems with universal suffrage) through electoral alliances with bourgeois parties, voting for parliamentary bills and state budgets. In the Reichstag, the SPD resorted to a policy of tactical compromise in order to exert direct influence on legislation. In 1894, the parliamentary SPD voted for a government bill for the first time ever. It reduced the import duty on wheat, which led to a reduction in the price of food. In 1913, the votes of SPD parliamentarians helped to bring in new tax laws affecting the wealthy, which were necessary due to the increase in military spending.|$|E
25|$|The Leadville strike had winnowed out miners {{who were}} {{antagonistic}} toward, or not fully {{supportive of the}} union's goals. The members who were left agreed that they {{were engaged in a}} <b>class-based</b> struggle that called for a more militant and confrontational disposition. Employers themselves had dictated the old rules for the struggle, but after Leadville the union no longer believed those rules applied. Many of the WFM members were moving beyond reformist sentiments, to a realization that if they were to obtain the just solution that they sought, the system needed to be overturned. In a document called the November 1897 proclamation, the union miners and their allies vowed to launch a new federation which would reflect their growing class consciousness.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>class-based</b> English {{society of}} the time, Faraday was not {{considered}} a gentleman. When Davy {{set out on a}} long tour of the continent in 1813–15, his valet did not wish to go, so instead, Faraday went as Davy's scientific assistant and was asked to act as Davy's valet until a replacement could be found in Paris. Faraday was forced to fill the role of valet as well as assistant throughout the trip. Davy's wife, Jane Apreece, refused to treat Faraday as an equal (making him travel outside the coach, eat with the servants, etc.), and made Faraday so miserable that he contemplated returning to England alone and giving up science altogether. The trip did, however, give him access to the scientific elite of Europe and exposed him to a host of stimulating ideas.|$|E
25|$|With the Quiet Revolution, Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism {{and later}} the October Crisis the party's {{position}} on the national question {{became the subject of}} broad debate across the country, and influenced the agreement of the Canadian Labour Congress to work with the Quebec Federation of Labour on an equal and voluntary basis. The communists called for workers sympathetic with independence movements to unite on a common, immediate <b>class-based</b> programme of common struggle with English-speaking Canadian workers. The PCQ helped re-launch Montreal's mass May Day demonstrations and advanced many unique policies including the idea of a federated party of labour, which proved its prescience with the formation of Québec solidaire. The federated party of labour proposal was endorsed by the late 1960s by most trade union centrals, but the project was eclipsed by the emergence of the Parti Quebecois.|$|E
25|$|Education in the United States {{had long}} been a local affair with schools governed by locally elected school boards. As {{with much of the}} culture of the United States, {{education}} varied widely in the North and the South. In the New England states public education was common, although it was often <b>class-based</b> with the working class receiving little benefits. Instruction and curriculum were all locally determined and teachers were expected to meet rigorous demands of strict moral behaviour. Schools taught religious values and applied Calvinist philosophies of discipline which included corporal punishment and public humiliation. In the South, there was very little organization of a public education system. Public schools were very rare and most education took place in the home with the family acting as instructors. The wealthier planter families were able to bring in tutors for instruction in the classics but many yeoman farming families had little access to education outside of the family unit.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s the IRA {{once more}} {{came under the}} {{influence}} of left-wing thinkers, especially those such as C. Desmond Greaves and Roy Johnston active in the Connolly Association. This move to a <b>class-based</b> political outlook and the consequent rejection of any stance that could be seen as sectarian—including the use of IRA arms to defend one side, that side being the beleaguered Catholic communities of Belfast in the Northern Ireland riots of August 1969—was {{to be one of the}} factors in the 1969 split that led to the Provisional IRA wing of the republican movement, with the latter subscribing to a traditional Catholic/nationalist analysis of the situation while the Officials subscribed to the Marxist view that internal strife among the working classes served only the interest of capital. The Irish Department of Justice had noticed the tensions in March 1969 and advised the Dublin government to use them to fragment the IRA.|$|E
25|$|The game uses a <b>class-based</b> {{character}} system, {{similar to}} the system found in Pandemic's previous game Star Wars: Battlefront. There are four playable classes. Warriors are a melee combat unit which focus on swordsmanship. Unlike the other classes, whose special attacks recharge over time, warriors can only gain energy by defeating enemies, which allows them to unleash more powerful attacks with a flaming sword, such as spinning to hit every adjacent enemy. They are the only class that can block or perform counterattacks with special moves. The warrior also has a throwing axe as a secondary, medium ranged weapon. Archers are better suited for long range combat and are equipped with a bow and arrow. Different types of arrows can be equipped: fire arrows, which can knock down enemies and deal explosive damage; poison arrows, which slow enemies down and do damage over time, {{and the ability to}} fire a volley of three normal arrows at multiple enemies at once. They also have a kick for use in close-quarters, which knocks back the enemy. They can also hit concealed Scouts with the multiple arrow skill. A headshot will allow the archer to kill most enemies in a single hit.|$|E
25|$|Clenora Hudson-Weems's Africana womanism {{arose from}} a {{nationalist}} Africana studies concept. In Africana Womanism: Reclaiming Ourselves, Hudson-Weems explores {{the limitations of}} feminist theory and explains the ideas and activism of different African women who have contributed to womanist theory. At its core, Africana womanism rejects feminism because it is {{set up in a}} way as to promote the issues of white women over the issues of Black women. Hudson-Weems argues that feminism will never be okay for black women due to the implications of slavery and prejudice. She further asserts that the relationship between a Black man and a Black woman is significantly different from the relationship between a White man and a White woman, because the white woman battles the white man for subjugating her, but the black women battles all oppressive forces that subjugate her, her children, and the black man. She further asserts that racism forced African-American men and African-American women to assume unconventional gender roles. In this context, the desire of mainstream feminism to dismantle traditional gender roles becomes inapplicable to the black experience. Unlike womanism, Africana womanism is an ideology designed specifically with women of African descent in mind. It is grounded in African culture and focuses on the unique struggles, needs, and desires of African women. Based on this reasoning, Africana Womanism posits race- and <b>class-based</b> oppression as far more significant than gender-based oppression.|$|E
25|$|One factor fueling General American's {{popularity}} was {{the major}} demographic change of twentieth-century American society: increased suburbanization, leading to less mingling of different social classes and less density and diversity of linguistic interactions. As a result, wealthier and higher-educated Americans' communications became more restricted to their own demographic, which, alongside their new marketplace that transcended regional boundaries (arising from the century's faster transportation methods), reinforced a widespread belief that highly educated Americans should not possess a regional accent. A General American sound is then the result of both suburbanization and suppression of regional accent by highly educated Americans in formal settings. A second factor was a rise in immigration to the Great Lakes area (one native region of General American speech) following the region's rapid industrialization after the American Civil War, when this region's speakers went on to form a successful and highly mobile business elite, who travelled {{around the country in}} the mid-twentieth century, spreading the high status of their accent system. A third possible factor is that various sociological (often race- and <b>class-based)</b> forces unconsciously repelled socially-conscious Americans away from pronunciations associated with African Americans and poor white communities in the South and with Southern and Eastern European immigrant communities (for example, American Jews) in the coastal Northeast, instead settling upon or favoring pronunciations more prestigiously associated with White Anglo-Saxon Protestant culture in the remainder of the country: namely, the West, Midwest, and western New England.|$|E
500|$|C# (pronounced as see sharp) is a multi-paradigm {{programming}} language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (<b>class-based),</b> and component-oriented programming disciplines.

500|$|Perl 5 added {{features}} that support complex data structures, first-class functions (that is, closures as values), and an object-oriented programming model. These include references, packages, <b>class-based</b> method dispatch, and lexically scoped variables, along with compiler directives (for example, the strict pragma). A major additional feature introduced with Perl 5 was {{the ability to}} package code as reusable modules. Wall later stated that [...] "The whole intent of Perl 5's module system was to encourage the growth of Perl culture rather than the Perl core." ...|$|E

Although she had been active with the socialist-leaning ILP in years past, Pankhurst had begun to see leftist {{politics}} as disagreeable, an attitude which intensified {{while she was in}} Russia. The meeting was uncomfortable for both parties; he felt that she was unable to appreciate the <b>class-based</b> conflict driving Russian policy at the time. He concluded by telling her that English women had nothing to teach women in Russia. She later told the New York Times that he was the [...] "biggest fraud of modern times" [...] and that his government could [...] "destroy civilisation." ...|$|E

500|$|Bates {{was charged}} with high treason, and tried at Westminster Hall on Monday 27 January 1606, {{alongside}} seven of his fellow conspirators. He arrived at the hall separately from the others; prisons operated on a <b>class-based</b> system {{and so he was}} kept at the Gatehouse Prison, rather than the Tower. [...] Only Digby pleaded not guilty. [...] On the morning of 30 January 1606 therefore, Bates was tied to a wattled hurdle and dragged by horse along the street, from the Gatehouse Prison to the western end of St Paul's Churchyard. [...] There he was present as first Digby, then Robert Wintour, and then Grant, were hanged, drawn and quartered. [...] Bates was the last to ascend the scaffold that day, and met a similarly gruesome end. The following day the four remaining conspirators were executed in the same manner.|$|E
500|$|During this period, an army {{formation}} of around 5,000 men {{was known as}} a legion (Latin: legio). However, in contrast to later legionary formations of exclusively heavy infantry, the legions of the early and middle Republic consisted of both light and heavy infantry. The term manipular army, an army based on units called maniples (Latin manipulus singular, manipuli plural, from manus, [...] "the hand"), is therefore used to contrast the later legionary army of the Empire that was based around a system of cohort units. The manipular army was based partially upon social class and partially upon age and military experience. It therefore represents a theoretical compromise between the earlier <b>class-based</b> army and the class-free armies of later years. In practice, even slaves were at one time pressed into the army of the Republic out of necessity. Normally a single legion was raised each year, but in 366BC two legions were raised in a single year for the first time.|$|E
500|$|The {{multiplayer}} mode in StarCraft: Ghost {{differs from}} the stealth-based mechanics of the single-player portion. It aims to give players a personal view of the battles from the real-time strategy games of the series. Accordingly, Ghosts multiplayer is structured around <b>class-based</b> team gameplay and fighting {{in a variety of}} game modes. Ghost incorporates traditional game modes from multiplayer video games such as deathmatch, capture the flag, and king of the hill, but also introduces two game modes specifically designed for the StarCraft universe. The first is [...] "Mobile Conflict", which requires two teams to fight for control of a single Terran military factory with the ability of atmospheric flight. Using vehicles and team tactics, both teams must first board the structure and then capture its control room to fly it to the team's starting point. The structure must then land and be defended from capture by the opposing team for a set amount of time.|$|E
500|$|Scholar Yasmin Y. DeGout cites [...] "The Couple" [...] as {{an example}} of Angelou's {{practice}} of subtly including more than one level of meaning in her poems, of her ability to translate her personal experience into political discourse, and her placement of themes of racism and liberation. [...] Angelou combines liberation ideology and poetic technique to challenge society's concepts of gender identity, especially in how it affects women. [...] She varies the length of the poem's lines, beginning in the first stanza and continuing throughout the poem, to convey ambiguity and doubt, and to demand that the reader question their perceptions of gender and power. [...] "The Couple", starting in its second stanza, attacks <b>class-based</b> ideals of masculinity in society. [...] The poem ends by demanding that the social constructs surrounding gender and class end, and insists that human survival depends upon recognizing shared emotions and experience, regardless of one's gender or position in society.|$|E
500|$|Since its foundation, the key {{ideology}} {{has been}} Marxism–Leninism, {{but since the}} introduction of a mixed economy in the late 1980s and 1990s, it has lost its monopolistic ideological and moral legitimacy. Marxism–Leninism, which is a <b>class-based</b> ideology, lost its legitimacy because of the mixed economy. As became clear because of the Đổi Mới reforms, the Party could not base its rule on defending only the workers and the peasants, which was officially referred to as the [...] "working class-peasant alliance". In the constitution introduced in 1992, the State represented the [...] "workers, peasants and intellectuals". In recent years, the Party has stopped representing a specific class, but instead the [...] "interests of the entire people", which includes entrepreneurs. The final class barrier was removed in 2002, when party members were allowed to engage in private activities. In the face of de-emphasising the role of Marxism–Leninism, the Party has acquired a broader ideology, laying more emphasis on nationalism, developmentalism and becoming the protector of tradition.|$|E
500|$|Within a {{few decades}} Gunpowder Treason Day, as it was known, became the {{predominant}} English state commemoration, but as it carried strong Protestant religious overtones it also became a focus for anti-Catholic sentiment. [...] Puritans delivered sermons regarding the perceived dangers of popery, while during increasingly raucous celebrations common folk burnt effigies of popular hate-figures, such as the pope. [...] Towards {{the end of the}} 18th century reports appear of children begging for money with effigies of Guy Fawkes and 5November gradually became known as Guy Fawkes Day. [...] Towns such as Lewes and Guildford were in the 19th century scenes of increasingly violent <b>class-based</b> confrontations, fostering traditions those towns celebrate still, albeit peaceably. [...] In the 1850s changing attitudes resulted in the toning down of much of the day's anti-Catholic rhetoric, and the Observance of 5th November Act was repealed in 1859. [...] Eventually the violence was dealt with, and by the 20th century Guy Fawkes Day had become an enjoyable social commemoration, although lacking much of its original focus. [...] The present-day Guy Fawkes Night is usually celebrated at large organised events, centred on a bonfire and extravagant firework displays.|$|E
500|$|Biko {{rejected}} the apartheid government's division of South Africa's population into tribal and ethnic groups, instead dividing the population into two categories: {{the white and}} the black. He defined blackness as a [...] "mental attitude" [...] rather than a [...] "matter of pigmentation", referring to [...] "blacks" [...] as [...] "those who are by law or tradition politically, economically and socially discriminated against as a group in the South African society" [...] and who identify [...] "themselves as a unit in the struggle towards the realization of their aspirations". In this way, he and the Black Consciousness Movement used [...] "black" [...] in reference not only to Bantu-speaking Africans but also to Coloureds and Indians, which together made up almost 90% of South Africa's population in the 1970s. Biko was not a Marxist and {{believed that it was}} oppression based on race, rather than class, which would be the main political motivation for change in South Africa. He argued that those on the [...] "white left" [...] often promoted a <b>class-based</b> analysis as a [...] "defence mechanism... primarily because they want to detach us from anything relating to race. In case it has a rebound effect on them because they are white".|$|E
500|$|The {{industrial}} faculties had {{the task}} of preparing artists of a new type, artists capable of working {{not only in the}} traditional pictorial and plastic arts but also capable of creating all objects in the human environment such as the articles of daily life, the implements of labor, etc. The industrial department at Vkhutemas endeavored to create products of viability in the economy and functionality found in society. <b>Class-based</b> political requirements steered artists toward crafts, and the designing of household or industrial goods. There was significant pressure in this respect by the Central Committee of the Communist Party, that in 1926, 1927, and 1928, required a student body composition [...] "of worker and peasant origins", and several demands for [...] "working class" [...] elements. This push for design economy resulted in a tendency towards working, functional designs with minimised luxuries. Tables designed by Rodchenko were equipped with mechanical moving parts, and were standardised and multi-functional. The products designed at Vkhutemas never bridged the gap between workshops and factory production, although they cultivated a factory aesthetic—Popova, Stepanova, and Tatlin even designed worker's industrial apparel. Furniture pieces constructed at Vkhutemas explored the possibilities of new industrial materials such as plywood and tubular steel.|$|E
500|$|The Elite Force {{expansion}} pack {{added an}} additional five-game types. In an [...] "assimilation" [...] match, one team plays as Borg and must attempt to assimilate the other team; {{if a player}} is assimilated, they join the Borg team, gradually {{reducing the number of}} players on the other team. The [...] "action hero" [...] mode gives one player more weapons, health, and overall power than every other player, but when an opposing player kills this player they take these advantages. A further game type known as [...] "elimination" [...] is a deathmatch game except that players can't respawn. As player characters are killed, they sit out the remainder of the round until only one player is left alive. The [...] "disintegration" [...] mode gives every player a slow firing semi-automatic phaser rifle that will kill and vaporize an opposing player in one shot, thus requiring shots to be carefully aimed to ensure they hit. The final game mode, called [...] "specialties," [...] adds a <b>class-based</b> mode for team deathmatch and capture the flag modes, giving players the option to choose from one of six combat roles, such as a sniper, medic or infiltrator, each with different weapons, speeds and abilities.|$|E
