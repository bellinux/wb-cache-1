5000|$|A PTE has {{significant}} risk; mortality {{for the operation}} is typically 5%, but less in centers with high volume and experience. Individuals with favorable hemodynamic risk profiles also demonstrate lower mortality rates (1.3%). PTEs are risky because of what is done {{and how it is}} done. PTEs involve a full cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), deep hypothermia and full cardiac arrest, with the <b>critical</b> <b>procedure</b> carried out in a standstill operation. The reason for the complexity of procedure comes from the anatomy. The obvious part is that a pulmonary bypass is required. Surgeons cannot operate on something they cannot see; the blood going to the lungs has to be diverted from the pulmonary vasculature and lung function taken care of by a machine. Less obvious is that hypothermia is required. This goes back to the pathophysiology of emboli; they are organized, somewhat delicate, essentially part of the vessel wall, and hard to remove completely, unlike in an acute pulmonary embolectomy (for acute pulmonary embolism, which is done without hypothermia). [...] Making this task more difficult is the anatomy of the lung and pathophysiology of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension; lungs also get blood from the bronchial arteries are often enlarged. The practical implication is that a conventional cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is not sufficient to do the surgery because: ...|$|E

30|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} {{has been}} the <b>critical</b> <b>procedure</b> to exploit unconventional gas reservoirs, such as shale gas reservoirs (Saldungaray and Palisch 2013). However this technique has several major shortcomings (Cha et al. 2014). Firstly, the water used in this practice can cause clay swelling and thus the capillary fluid retention significantly reduces the permeability. Secondly, the required large amount of water consumption may be detrimental on the local water supply. Finally, the down hole injection of chemicals commonly required in hydraulic fracturing can contaminate the local underground water resource. On the contrary, cryogenic fracturing, such as liquid nitrogen cooling, is more promising due to its efficiency and it can avoid the defects of hydraulic fracturing.|$|E

40|$|Expansive {{alternative}} {{dispute resolution}} (ADR) was {{the centerpiece of}} efficiency-based procedural reforms in the 1980 s and early 1990 s. ADR and other reforms collectively altered the litigation landscape, at times for the better. Yet some scholars raised early questions about ADR’s effect on systemic litigation fairness {{and the ability of}} the disenfranchised to assert and maintain claims in court. Amid second wave procedural changes, commencing around the mid- 2000 s, a Justice Scalia-led majority significantly expanded the grasp of compelled, private, and individualized arbitration. Under the shroud of efficiency, that Court majority imposed those second wave changes by judicial fiat, bypassing formal rulemaking. Collectively, both waves sharply constrict court access and claim development to the detriment of less powerful social groups. Two Supreme Court cases—American Express Co. v. Italian Colors Restaurant (Amex) and AT 2 ̆ 6 T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion (Concepcion) —epitomize ADR’s privatization (without judges, full discovery, or public scrutiny) and individuation (without class adjudication, broad joinder, or cost sharing) of claims by employees, consumers, tenants, small businesses, and discrimination claim-ants against more powerful businesses and institutions. This Article first articulates a developing <b>Critical</b> <b>Procedure</b> analytical framework for assessing the political and ideological preferences in and intended substantive consequences of procedure’s formation, application, and revision. It then assesses Amex and Concepcion through this <b>critical</b> <b>procedure</b> lens and concludes that these ostensibly efficiency-driven ADR rulings are actually a claim suppressing mechanism that effectively shields large businesses from substantive law liability and public accountability, creating “an alternate system of justice” for those businesses that casts doubt about the legitimacy of the legal system...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} monitor temperature in neurosurgical bone grinding procedure using the motor electrical power as input. Bone grinding is a <b>critical</b> <b>procedure</b> in the skull base neurosurgery to remove the cranial bone and approach the tumor through the sphenoid sinus. Heat generated during grinding could damage the optic nerve or coagulate the blood in the carotid artery, while direct temperature measurement is difficult. The temperature estimation is realized using a heat conversion model and the thermal model based on finite element analysis (FEA). The heat conversion model determines heat generation based on its linear correlation to the motor electrical power. The FEA thermal model calculates the temperature on the bone surface using the obtained heat. Bone grinding experiments are conducted, and results demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of proposed model for monitoring local temperature in endonasal bone grinding...|$|E
