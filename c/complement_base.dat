50|$|Named {{after its}} inventor, {{biologist}} Edwin Southern, the Southern blot {{is a method}} for probing {{for the presence of}} a specific DNA sequence within a DNA sample. DNA samples before or after restriction enzyme (restriction endonuclease) digestion are separated by gel electrophoresis and then transferred to a membrane by blotting via capillary action. The membrane is then exposed to a labeled DNA probe that has a <b>complement</b> <b>base</b> sequence to the sequence on the DNA of interest. Southern blotting is less commonly used in laboratory science due to the capacity of other techniques, such as PCR, to detect specific DNA sequences from DNA samples. These blots are still used for some applications, however, such as measuring transgene copy number in transgenic mice or in the engineering of gene knockout embryonic stem cell lines.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{have done}} a {{comparative}} study for a set of protocols supporting IP mobility, such as Mobile IP (MIP), Hierarchical Mobile IP (HMIP), Wireless IP, Cellular IP, HAWAII, TeleMIP and Dynamic Mobility Agent (DMA). These IP-based mobility protocols will {{play an important role in}} the convergence of IP and legacy wireless networks, within the context of the future 4 G networks.

It has been observed that IP mobility management schemes such as MIP (for interdomain mobility) and Cellular IP (for intradomain mobility) might be required for fast and seamless handoff as well as for real time traffic management.

40|$|The local {{mechanical}} properties of DNA {{are believed to}} play an important role in their biological functions and DNA-based nanomechanical devices. Using a simple sphere-tip compression system, the local radial {{mechanical properties}} of DNA are systematically studied by changing the tip size. The compression simulation results for the 16 nm diameter sphere tip are well consistent with the experimental results. With the diameter of the tip decreasing, the radial compressive elastic properties under external loads become sensitive to the tip size and the local DNA conformation. There appears a suddenly force break in the compression-force curve when the sphere size is less than or equal to 12 nm diameter. The analysis of the hydrogen bonds and base stacking interaction shows there is a local unwinding process occurs. During the local unwinding process, first the hydrogen bonds between <b>complement</b> <b>base</b> pairs are broken. With the compression aggregating, the local backbones in the compression center are unwound from the double helix conformation to a kind of parallel conformation. This local unwinding behavior deducing by external loads is helpful to understand the biological process, and important to DNA-based nanomechanical devices...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To measure plasma {{levels of}} angiopoietin- 1 (Ang- 1), angiopoietin- 2 (Ang- 2), and {{vascular}} endothelial growth factor (VEGF) early after trauma {{and to determine}} their clinical significance. BACKGROUND: Angiopoietins and VEGF {{play a central role}} in the physiology and pathophysiology of endothelial cells. Ang- 2 has recently been shown to have pathogenetic significance in sepsis and acute lung injury. Little is known about the role of angiopoietins and VEGF early after trauma. METHODS: Blood specimens from consecutive major trauma patients were obtained immediately upon arrival in the emergency department and plasma samples assayed for Ang- 1, Ang- 2, VEGF, markers of endothelial activation, protein C pathway, fibrinolytic system, and <b>complement.</b> <b>Base</b> deficit was used as a measure of tissue hypoperfusion. Data were collected prospectively. RESULTS: Blood samples were obtained from 208 adult trauma patients within 30 minutes after injury before any significant fluid resuscitation. Plasma levels of Ang- 2, but not Ang- 1 and VEGF were increased and correlated independently with severity of injury and tissue hypoperfusion. Furthermore, plasma levels of Ang- 2 correlated with markers of endothelial activation, coagulation abnormalities, and activation of the complement cascade and were associated with worse clinical outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Ang- 2 is released early after trauma with the degree proportional to both injury severity and systemic hypoperfusion. High levels of Ang- 2 were associated with an activated endothelium, coagulation abnormalities, complement activation, and worse clinical outcome. These data indicate that Ang- 2 is a marker and possibly a direct mediator of endothelial activation and dysfunction after severe trauma...|$|E
40|$|Nucleic acids are information-dense, {{programmable}} polymers {{that can}} be engineered into primers, probes, molecular motors, and signal amplification circuits for computation, diagnostic, and therapeutic purposes. Signal amplification circuits increase the signal-to-noise ratio of target nucleic acids {{in the absence of}} enzymes and thermal cycling. Amplification is made possible via toehold mediated strand displacement – a process where one nucleic acid strand binds to a nucleation site on a complementary helix, which then displaces one of the two strands in a nucleic acid complex. When compared to polymerase chain reactions (PCR), the sensitivity and stability of toehold-mediated strand displacement reactions suffer from circuit leakage – reactions of the system {{in the absence of an}} initiator. Presented here, from a materials science and engineering perspective, defect engineering has improved the leakage performance of model strand displacement systems made from DNA. Engineered defects used in this study included mismatched base pairs and alternative nucleic acids – both of which are known to impact the stability of hybridization. To identify sources of leakage in a model signal amplification circuit, availability was defined as the probability that a DNA base (A. T. C. G) was unpaired at equilibrium. This design metric was calculated using NUPACK, a thermodynamic modeling tool. To further understand the relationship between leakage rates and secondary structures, mutual availability was defined as the sum of all pairwise products of the availabilities of the corresponding bases in solution. This thermodynamic analysis yielded rational design principles for how to minimize leakage by as much as 4 -fold by site-specifically introducing mismatched base pairs into DNA duplex regions. To further reduce leakage, chemically modified locked nucleic acids (LNAs) were site-specifically introduced into a model DNA strand displacement system. Briefly described, LNAs are geometrically restricted RNA analogues with enhanced thermo-mechanical stability towards their <b>complement</b> <b>base.</b> When compared to a DNA control with identical sequences, the leakage exhibited by a hybrid DNA/LNA system was reduced from 1. 48 M- 1 s- 1 (for the DNA system) to 0. 03 M- 1 s- 1. In addition, the signal-to-noise ratio increased ~ 50 -fold for a similar hybrid system. This research provides insight into the sources of leakage in DNA strand-displacement systems, as well as how to maximize strand-displacement performance via the selective introduction of hybridization defects. Rational design of future nucleic acid signal amplification circuits will lead to broader applications in a variety of fields that range from DNA computation to point-of-care diagnostics and therapeutics...|$|E
