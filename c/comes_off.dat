5|$|Submerged {{arc welding}} (SAW) is a {{high-productivity}} welding method {{in which the}} arc is struck beneath a covering layer of flux. This increases arc quality, since contaminants in the atmosphere are blocked by the flux. The slag that forms on the weld generally <b>comes</b> <b>off</b> by itself, and combined {{with the use of}} a continuous wire feed, the weld deposition rate is high. Working conditions are much improved over other arc welding processes, since the flux hides the arc and almost no smoke is produced. The process is commonly used in industry, especially for large products and in the manufacture of welded pressure vessels. Other arc welding processes include atomic hydrogen welding, electroslag welding, electrogas welding, and stud arc welding.|$|E
5|$|The player {{assumes the}} role of Tomoya Okazaki, the protagonist of Clannad. Tomoya has been labeled a delinquent; at the {{beginning}} of the story, he even expresses hatred toward the city he has lived in all his life where Clannad is set. He is very straightforward in his comments to others and will not hesitate to speak his mind, even if he <b>comes</b> <b>off</b> as rude during such times. Despite this, Tomoya is very loyal to his friends, and has been known to dedicate himself for those around him in need of help or support. He generally has a selfless personality and does not ask much from others in return for what he does for them.|$|E
5|$|The {{walls of}} the college were built using rubble from Oxfordshire dressed with local stone. The {{remaining}} parts of the 17th-century walls are dressed with Headington stone, which was a common building material in Oxford at that time: the geologist W. J. Arkell wrote that it was used for every building in Oxford constructed during this century for which records exist. Areas of Headington stone {{can be seen in}} the first quadrangle on the wall of the hall. It was only discovered towards the end of the 18th century that it did not weather well: the surface of the stone develops a hard crust, which blisters, bursts and <b>comes</b> <b>off.</b> Much of it has subsequently been replaced with other materials as a result.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two main}} ways that the offense can advance the ball: running and passing. In a typical play, the quarterback calls the play, and the center passes the ball {{backwards}} and under his legs to the quarterback in {{a process known as}} the snap. The quarterback then either hands the ball off to a back, throws the ball or runs with it himself. The play ends when the player with the ball is tackled or goes out of bounds, or a pass hits the ground without a player having caught it. A forward pass can only be legally attempted if the passer is behind the line of scrimmage. In the NFL, a down also ends if the runner's helmet <b>comes</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E

Rhonda, who also <b>comes</b> <b>off</b> as rather narcissistic about her good looks and self-obsessed, usually (always?) refers to herself in the third person, by her first name. Rhonda often bursts into Laverne and Shirley's apartment (occasionally at inopportune times, much like Lenny and Squiggy often do) to borrow things without really asking and to brag about her social engagements or romantic dates with desirable men {{with the intention of}} making the girls envious.|$|E
25|$|The {{pitch is}} said to be covered when the groundsmen have placed covers on it to protect it against rain or dew. The use or non-use of covers {{significantly}} affects the way the ball <b>comes</b> <b>off</b> the pitch, making the matter potentially controversial. Law 11 of the Laws of Cricket provides that during the match the pitch shall not be completely covered unless provided otherwise by regulations or by agreement before the toss. When possible, the bowlers' run ups are covered in inclement weather to keep them dry. If the pitch is covered overnight, the covers are removed in the morning at the earliest possible moment on each day that play is expected to take place. If covers are used during the day as protection from inclement weather or if inclement weather delays the removal of overnight covers, they are removed as soon as conditions allow. Excess water can be removed from a pitch or the outfield using a machine called a water hog.|$|E

25|$|Like {{many other}} codes of football, {{the way to}} score points is to score goals. In Australian Football, {{there are two types}} of scores: a goal and a behind. There are four posts at each end of the ground; the two middle (and taller) posts are the goal posts, and the two outer (and shorter) posts are the behind posts. The area between the goal posts is the goal; kicking the ball between these posts scores a goal which is worth six points. Kicking the ball between a goal and a behind post scores a behind, which {{constitutes}} a single point. A behind is also scored if the ball passes between the goal posts but has not been kicked by the attacking team (e.g., it <b>comes</b> <b>off</b> the hands of either team, or is kicked by the defending team), or if the ball hits or passes directly above the goal post. (If the ball hits the behind post, the ball is considered to have gone out of bounds.) A rushed behind (also worth one point) is scored when the defending team deliberately forces the ball between any of the posts. This may occur in pressure situations where a defender decides that it is safer to concede one point to the opposing team rather than risk a goal being scored.|$|E
25|$|In 1490 he {{received}} his Doctorate in Theology, though he never made any original contribution to Theology. He just {{was not interested in}} this abstract speculation. Indeed, in the disputations that he is recorded as having carried out, with other University Doctors, he always <b>comes</b> <b>off</b> second best. He was more interested in the practical means of salvation—in his terms, a return to poverty and complete self-denial—and these he preached, in a Flemish accent, but in powerful French. He followed the rule of Francis of Paola very strictly and preached that all priests and monks should do so too. By 1493, there were 80 students at the College. They only left when they went to a monastery or to become a parish priest. Standonck hoped by this means to reform the church. In the same year, the King had set up a Commission to examine abuses in the church and he was asked to give a lecture to them, which he did on 12 November at Tours. In this he set out a long list of demands. Most of these were familiar to church reformers—only fit and proper persons should be priests, there should be no money charged for their services, or for accepting a post. There should be free election (by fit and proper priests) of their bishops, or monks of their abbots, and all other religious positions (including teachers at the University). He added demands that the priests and monks should lead exemplary lives. This meant his by now well known strictly ascetic life—including enforcing celibacy among the clergy.|$|E
