50|$|In {{comparison}} with the mass-produced gondola car of model 12-9046, a new model has an all-metal welded body volume which is increased by 2 cubic meters to 87 cubic meters. The cover of the side and the end walls is made of smooth sheet instead of the curved profile. On the end wall two zones and five efforts of the P-shaped cross section are set, which ensure high rigidity for the perception of stress in the collisions. Tare weight of the gondola car is reduced per ton. Bearing metal frame, body, parts of the brake linkage, cover of the body, the hatch covers are made of low-alloyed steel according to GOST 19281-89 14 category, the strength class of which {{is not less than}} 390. <b>Centre</b> <b>girder</b> is equipped with more technologically advanced and reliable in operation welded lugs. The running gear of the gondola car consists of 2 two-axle bogies of model 18-7020, which are equipped with elastic-rolling runner skids of a new system. In order to improve traffic safety the gondola is equipped with a new system of separate braking carts. Overhaul of the new gondola is increased to 32 years, whereas mileage of nowadays produced analogues is 22 years.|$|E
50|$|The Quart Pot Creek Rail Bridge {{comprises}} 7 50-foot (15.2 metre) spans of 3 rivetted deck {{type metal}} double lattice girders supported on six concrete piers and two abutments. It has a total length of 106.7 metres. The <b>centre</b> <b>girders,</b> the pier tops and bedplates have been altered. The No.7 span has been braced. The bridge carries a single 1.07m gauge railway.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I {{am afraid}} there is none. If {{we were to}} crawl up to them to-night and shoot down all at {{this end of the}} bridge, we should be no nearer. You see, there are a line of huts on this side, and two or three better- class houses. No doubt the railway {{officials}} and natives all live there; they would all turn out when they heard the firing, and the Boers would come rushing over from the other side. It would be out of the question for us to carry forward those four boxes {{to the middle of the}} bridge, plant them over the <b>centre</b> of the <b>girders,</b> and light the fuses. A quarter of an hour would be wanted for the business at the very least, and we should not have a minute, if there is as good a guard by night as there is by day. It is likely to be at least as large, perhaps much more than that. The thing is impossible in that way. However, of course we can crawl up close after dark and satisfy ourselves about the guard.|$|R
500|$|The {{construction}} railway {{followed the}} route of the former River Irwell. To bring in construction materials, the construction railway had a connection to the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC) east of Irlam railway station. Every month this allowed more than 10,000 tons of coal and 8,000 tons of cement to be delivered to sites along the canal excavation. All existing railway companies with lines along the route had been given notice that their lines had to either be abandoned by a given date or raised to give a minimum of [...] clearance with all deviation construction costs to be paid by the MSC. The CLC Glazebrook to Woodley mainline passed over the River Mersey at Cadishead and so they decided to build a deviation. Construction of the Cadishead Viaduct began in 1892, approached via earth banks, with two brick arches accessing a multi-lattice iron <b>girder</b> <b>centre</b> span of [...] in length. It opened to freight on 27 February 1893 and to passenger traffic on 29 May 1893. Following the withdrawal of passenger services in 1964, the line became freight only. When expensive repairs to the viaduct were needed in the early 1980s British Rail opted to close it, together with the line to Glazebrook.|$|R
50|$|Running {{the bridge}} out is {{effected}} by pushing it along its rails until the outer two wheels {{are at the}} edge of the granite sill of the ditch. When the bridge is pushed beyond this point the two outer wheels do not descend the slopes of the granite slabs but instead the bridge remains in a horizontal position. This is due to the centre axle being offset from the <b>centre</b> of the <b>girders</b> causing the bridge to run on its inner two wheels. The middle two wheels follow along the trays. When the bridge is just less than halfway out, the ends of the centre axle then engage in the cups of the lifting arms. The middle two wheels partially descend the slopes of the granite sill. The bridge continues to move out, its outer end dipping below the horizontal, its inner wheels still running along the trays of the courtyard. The weight of the bridge, at the point where the centre of gravity of the lifting arms is beyond the pivot point of the arms and the stays, causes the bridge mechanism to descend, its wheels running up the vertical racers set into the wall of the pit. At a point where the inner wheels are at the top of the slope down the granite sill, the outer ends of the girders and the outer wheels hit curved sprung metal guides.These guide the outer end of the bridge upwards so that the ends of the girders come to rest on the lip of the granite slab, the inner wheels descending the slope of the inner granite slab. The inner end of each girder is angled to form a close fit with the granite slab.|$|R
