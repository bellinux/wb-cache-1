50|$|The {{operation}} of the <b>closure</b> <b>valve</b> was to be critical:Along the upper surface of the pipe is a continuous slit or groove about two inches wide. This groove is covered by a valve, extending the whole length of the railway, formed of a strip of leather riveted between iron plates, the top plates being wider than the groove and serving to prevent the external air forcing the leather into the pipe when the vacuum is formed within it; and the lower plates fitting into the groove when the valve is shut, makes up the circle of the pipe, and prevents the air from passing the piston; one edge of this valve is securely held down by iron bars, fastened by screw bolts to a longitudinal rib cast on the pipe, and allows the leather between the plates and the bar {{to act as a}} hinge, similar to a common pump valve; the other edge of the valve falls into a groove which contains a composition of beeswax and tallow: this composition is solid at the temperature of the atmosphere, and becomes fluid when heated a few degrees above it. Over this valve is a protecting cover, which serves to preserve it from snow or rain, formed of thin plates of iron about five feet long hinged with leather, and the end of each plate underlaps the next {{in the direction of the}} piston's motion, thus ensuring the lifting of each in succession.|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was designed to}} determine the echocardiographic correlates of the aortic and pulmonary components of the second heart sound. Simultaneous recordings of the ECG, phonocardiogram, carotid pulse tracing and the echocardiogram of the aortic valve were made in 54 patients. The tracings were recorded at a paper speed of 100 mm/sec, with 20 msec time lines. Aortic <b>valve</b> <b>closure</b> (AVC) on the echocardiogram occurred {{before the onset of}} the aortic component of the second heart sound (A 2) in all but two patients. The mean AVC-to-A 2 interval was 12 msec with a range of 5 to 25 msec.

Pulmonary <b>valve</b> <b>closure</b> (PVC) on the echocardiogram preceded the pulmonary component of the second sound (P 2) in all patients.

40|$|Hydropower {{has played}} an {{essential}} role in the Norwegian power production over the last century. Approximately 99. 9 % of the total production comes from renewable sources, of which hydropower represent 99 %. Changes in runner materials and designs have contributed to a tremendous improvement of the overall turbine efficiency. Several methods of calculating the efficiency exists today, aiming to determine the performance of various turbines under various circumstances. Efficiency measurements in low-head machines have proven to be challenging, as difficult pipe geometry and short water inlets complicate the use of traditional measuring techniques. The object of this thesis has been to evaluate the pressure-time method as a relative method and examine the method s potential for application in hydraulic machines. Experimental pressure-time measurements were performed at the Waterpower laboratory at NTNU during the spring of 2016. Two flows at approximately 170 and 400 l/s were repeatedly measured and evaluated based on the work by former Ph. D. student P. Jonsson from LTU in Sweden. The relative pressure-time method presented in this thesis has been developed based on the experimental laboratory measurements. The pressure section used in the laboratory experiments was extended from 4 m to cover the entire area from the open reservoir to a pressure sensor 10 m upstream a <b>closure</b> <b>valve.</b> The geometrical constant was calculated using the laboratory pipe dimensions and incorporated into a developed MATLAB for further calculation of the relative pressure-time flow. Moreover, two numerical MOC codes were developed to verify the experimental results. One represents a simple pipeline with a maximum discharge of 400 l/s, while the second is a complex pipeline with a discharge of 600 l/s. The relative measurements show good accordance with the electromagnetic flowmeter installed on the test rig. Maximum discharge errors of 3. 38 % and 2. 56 % were found for the flows at 170 and 400 l/s, respectively. The numerical testing gave promising results with discharge errors of 0. 15 % and 0. 47 % for the simple and the complex pipeline. Low random errors over a wide range of repetitions implies consistency between the relative measurements. Moreover, an approach of the pipe factor provided final flows close to the reference flows recorded by the electromagnetic flowmeter. Evaluation of the presented method suggests that a relative pressure-time approach may possibly be relevant for future low-head machine testing...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} relations between mitral <b>valve</b> <b>closure</b> and mechanical {{events at the}} onset of left ventricular systole, simultaneous M mode echocardiograms and phonocardiograms were recorded with the apexcardiogram and its first differential (dA/dt) in 25 normal subjects and 88 patients with heart disease. The timing of mitral and aortic <b>valve</b> <b>closure</b> and the onset and peak rate of rise of the apexcardiogram with respect to the Q wave of the electrocardiogram were measured. There was considerable variation in the intervals from Q to mitral <b>valve</b> <b>closure</b> (Q-MVC) and from Q to peak dA/dt and in the isovolumic contraction time between normal subjects. There was no consistent abnormality of these intervals in patients with coronary artery or valvar disease, and no relation between the interval from Q to mitral <b>valve</b> <b>closure</b> and end diastolic pressure. When the timing of the first heart sound and peak dA/dt were considered together, however, clear abnormalities became apparent. In normal subjects, the intervals Q-MVC and Q to peak dA/dt were significantly correlated. In coronary artery disease, the expected relation between Q-MVC and Q to peak dA/dt was found only when end diastolic pressure was normal and was lost when end diastolic pressure was raised. Mitral stenosis was associated with delayed mitral closure in a few cases only, but in chronic aortic regurgitation closure was consistently early with respect to the apexcardiogram. In patients with atrial fibrillation and a normal mitral valve the timing of mitral <b>valve</b> <b>closure</b> with respect to the apexcardiogram was normal, which is inconsistent with an atrial contribution to the timing of mitral <b>valve</b> <b>closure.</b> Thus when considered in isolation the timing of mitral <b>valve</b> <b>closure</b> and the duration of isovolumic contraction time gave little information about cardiac function.

We have adopted a practice of central aortic <b>valve</b> <b>closure</b> by placing a simple coaptation stitch at left ventricular assist device implantation in patients with significant aortic insufficiency. We conducted a follow-up study to evaluate the efficacy and durability of this procedure. MethodsThe study included patients who had undergone continuous flow left ventricular assist device implantation. The patients were divided into 2 groups, {{those who did not}} require any aortic procedure because the valve was competent and those who underwent central aortic <b>valve</b> <b>closure</b> for mild or greater aortic regurgitation. The clinical endpoints were mortality, progression or recurrence of aortic insufficiency, and reoperation for aortic valve pathologic features. Aortic insufficiency was measured qualitatively from mild to severe on a scale of 0 to 5. ResultsA total of 123 patients received continuous flow left ventricular assist devices from February 2007 to August 2011. Of those, 18 (15 %) underwent central aortic <b>valve</b> <b>closure</b> at left ventricular assist device implantation because of significant aortic insufficiency (1. 8 ± 1. 4) and 105 who did not (competent aortic valve, 0. 15 ± 0. 43; P < . 01). At follow-up (median, 312 days; range, 0 - 1429 days), the mean aortic insufficiency score remained low for the patients with central aortic <b>valve</b> <b>closure</b> (0. 27 ± 0. 46) in contrast to those without central aortic <b>valve</b> <b>closure</b> who experienced aortic insufficiency progression (0. 78 ± 0. 89; P = . 02). In addition, the proportion of patients with more than mild aortic insufficiency was significantly less in the central aortic <b>valve</b> <b>closure</b> group (0 % vs 18 %; P = . 05). The patients in the central aortic <b>valve</b> <b>closure</b> group were significantly older and had a greater incidence of renal failure at baseline. The 30 -day mortality was greater in the central aortic <b>valve</b> <b>closure</b> group, but the late survival was similar between the 2 groups. No reoperations were required for recurrent aortic insufficiency. ConclusionsThe results of our study have shown that repair of aortic insufficiency with a simple central coaptation stitch is effective and durable in left ventricular assist device-supported patients, with follow-up extending into 2 years. Although aortic insufficiency progressed over time in those with minimal native valve regurgitation initially, no such progression was noted in those with central aortic <b>valve</b> <b>closure.</b> Additional investigation is needed to evaluate whether prophylactic central aortic <b>valve</b> <b>closure</b> should be performed at left ventricular assist device implantation to avoid problematic aortic regurgitation developing over time, in particular in patients undergoing left ventricular assist device implantation for life-long (destination therapy) support...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} functional and hemodynamic factors that determine the mitral-tricuspid and aortic-pulmonary <b>valve</b> <b>closure</b> sequence in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Background. The physiologic factors determining closure sequence of cardiac valves in various forms of heart disease have been found to be complex. Few data exist for dilated cardiomyopathy, particularly for differentiating the effects of a conduction delay versus changes in ventricular performance. Methods. A group of 64 patients were compared with 36 control subjects. Timing of <b>valve</b> <b>closure</b> and electromechanical intervals were determined by combined M-mode echocardiography, phonocardiography and apexcardiography. Hemodynamic data from right heart catheterization were available in 46 patients. Results. In all control subjects, the aortic valve closed before the pulmonary valve and the mitral valve closed before the tricuspid valve. In the study group, 30 patients (49 %) had reversed aortic-pulmonary <b>valve</b> <b>closure</b> and 27 (90 %) of these had a left-sided conduction delay. There were 38 patients (60 %) who had reversed mitral-tricuspid <b>valve</b> <b>closure,</b> but this was unrelated to the presence of a left-sided conduction delay. The presence of high ventricular filling pressures and poor systolic function was associated with delayed closure of both the mitral and the tricuspid valve. This caused the closure sequence to be related to the size of the difference between mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure and mean central venous pressure and also the magnitude of right ventricular dysfunction. Patients with a low wedge pressure (16 mm Hg) but a low central venous pressure had a high prevalence (86 %) of reversal of mitral-tricuspid <b>valve</b> <b>closure.</b> Patients with high wedge and central venous pressures had a moderate prevalence (47 %) of mitral-tricuspid <b>valve</b> <b>closure</b> reversal. Similar findings were observed for right ventricular dysfunction. If the right ventricle was normal or severely dysfunctional, a reversed closure sequence was less common (52 % and 41 %, respectively) than if moderate dysfunction was present (78 %). Conclusions. Aortic-pulmonary <b>valve</b> <b>closure</b> sequence is strongly related to the presence of a left-sided conduction delay. The mitraltricuspid <b>valve</b> <b>closure</b> sequence is unrelated to a conduction delay but can be reversed by relative differences in the severity of systolic dysfunction and filling pressures between the two ventricles...|$|R

Fluid pressure and flow rate variations in pipeline with respect to time after the <b>valve</b> <b>closure</b> are arrived from MOC model.

For this investigation, the cardiopulmonary system is modeled as an analog circuit, including heart chambers, the distal and proximal aorta, distal and proximal systemic arteries/veins, systemic capillaries, the vena cava, the distal and proximal pulmonary artery, distal and pro ximal pulmonary arteries/veins, pulmonary capil laries and physiological control of heart rate and cardiac contractibility. In this model, the ventricles, atria and arteries were modeled as advanced pressur-volume relationships. A vagal-sympathetic mechanism was adopted to simulate transient systemic and pulmonary blood pressure. Four intervals, i. e., the timing interval between mitral and aortic <b>valve</b> <b>closure</b> (TIMA), the timing interval between aortic and mitral <b>valve</b> <b>closure</b> (TIAM), the timing interval be- tween aortic and pulmonary <b>valve</b> <b>closure</b> (TIAP) and the timing interval between mitral and tricuspid <b>valve</b> <b>closure</b> (TIMT), are further defined in a heart cycle to illustrate their relationships to LVSBP. Simula- tions showed that the TIMA, TIAM and TIAP have strong negative correlations with LVSBP; meanwhile, the TIMT has a slightly negative relationship with LVSBP.

40|$|M-mode {{echocardiography}} {{was performed}} in 54 patients 1 month to 3 years after mitral valvotomy for dominant mitral stenosis. The mitral <b>valve</b> <b>closure</b> index (MVCI), an index previously shown to correlate well with the calculated mitral valve area, was used to diagnose residual mitral stenosis. Using the equation MVCI = 33 MVC [...] 12, 12 patients (22 %) were deemed to have mild, 4 (7 %) moderate, and 2 (4 %) severe residual stenosis. Repeat cardiac catheterisation confirmed the diagnosis in 7 patients. The postoperative mitral <b>valve</b> <b>closure</b> index correlated significantly with patients' subjective symptoms and objective exercise indices. It was higher in patients in whom the posterior mitral leaflet movement became normal after valvotomy, and was lower in patients in whom the anterior mitral leaflet excursions below 14 mm before operation. The mitral <b>valve</b> <b>closure</b> index is a sensitive index for diagnosing residual mitral stenosis after valvotomy...|$|R
40|$|Cardiac muscle {{stiffness}} {{can potentially}} be estimated non-invasively with shear wave elastography. Shear waves are {{present on the}} septal wall after mitral and aortic <b>valve</b> <b>closure,</b> thus providing an opportunity to assess stiffness in early systole and early diastole. We report on the shear wave recordings of 22 minipigs with high-frame-rate echocardiography. The waves were captured with 4000 frames/s using a programmable commercial ultrasound machine. The wave pattern was extracted from the data through a local tissue velocity estimator based on one-lag autocorrelation. The wave propagation velocity was determined with a normalized Radon transform, resulting in median wave propagation velocities of 2. 2  m/s after mitral <b>valve</b> <b>closure</b> and 4. 2  m/s after aortic <b>valve</b> <b>closure.</b> Overall the velocities ranged between 0. 8 and 6. 3  m/s in a 95 % confidence interval. By dispersion analysis {{we found that the}} propagation velocity only mildly increased with shear wave frequency. </p...|$|R
