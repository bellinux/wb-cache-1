It never <b>crossed</b> <b>my</b> mind that the {{occasion}} would ever arise, so when I got the phone call, it was really odd. There was never any doubt that I'd do it for Mike [...] and it's not something that's really been done — I don't think someone's ever died off-screen and then they've done the funeral on-screen. I think everyone was quite wary because it's quite an odd thing to do to have attended his real funeral and then go back to film it all over again. There was some trepidation about how it was going to work. But as soon as we arrived, it was like 11 years of your life had been wiped out and you'd been there the day before [...] I had this really lovely scene with Sid [...] where I said: [...] "Isn't it strange, you imagine you’d come back and everything would be here waiting for us just like it was."
