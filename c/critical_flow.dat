In this thesis, {{we focus}} on the {{bandwidth}} allocation on the bottleneck link and provide several allocation schemes to minimize the potential damage caused by flooding attacks. Assume that we know which <b>flows</b> are <b>critical</b> <b>flows,</b> and all other flows on the bottleneck link are considered as suspicious flows [4], when the delivery path is under attacks. The proposed schemes try to provide more bandwidth to <b>critical</b> <b>flows</b> and reduce damages as much as possible. Using these schemes, the system can properly allocate the bandwidth among <b>critical</b> <b>flows</b> and suspicious flows on the bottleneck link. At the same time, the congestion of the bottleneck link will be identified and the non-critical flows are tagged as suspicious flows. Once the congestion of the bottleneck link is identified, the bandwidth allocation of suspicious flows is reduced based on the proposed methods. In other words, we can supply proper bandwidth to <b>critical</b> <b>flows,</b> such that <b>critical</b> <b>flows</b> will suffer less damage. Ideally, if a suspicious flow can be determined as an attack flow, this flow will be dropped completely. As a result, the whole system will suffer less damage...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, mobile {{devices are}} widely used to store and process user privacy and {{confidential}} data. With the popularity of Android platform, the cases of attacks against usersâ€™ privacy-sensitive data within Android applications are on the rise. Researchers have developed sophisticated static and dynamic analysis tools to detect information leakage. These methods cannot distinguish legitimate usage of sensitive data in benign apps from the intentional sensitive data leakages in malicious apps. Recently, malicious apps {{have been found to}} treat sensitive data differently from benign apps. These differences can be used to flag malicious apps based on their abnormal data flows. In this paper, we further find that some sensitive data flows show great difference between benign apps and malware. We can use these differences to select <b>critical</b> data <b>flows.</b> These <b>critical</b> <b>flows</b> can guide the identification of malware based on the abnormal usage of sensitive data.

Some of the upstream motions do not decompose with the distance upstream. These â€˜columnarâ€™ modes have zero frequency and a sinusoidal structure {{in the direction of the}} density gradient; they effectively lead to a continuous change in upstream conditions. If the barrier is two-dimensional (i.e. of infinite extent in the direction perpendicular to the upstream flow and the direction of density gradient), inviscid theories show that the length of the upstreamregion affected by the columnar modes increases without bound as t->infinity. Non-zero viscosity (and/or diffusivity) will, however, limit the region affected, since the wave amplitudes will then slowly decay.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused {{attention}} on one-dimensional models for fast transient flows in a kinematic non-equilibrium. Besides the thermodynamic non-equilibrium, there is another type of non-equilibrium: the kinematic non-equilibrium, or drift between the phases. Such flow models include bubbly gas/liquid flows which are characterized by strong coupling between the phases, due to the rapid interphase transfers of mass, momentum and energy. As a consequence the assumptions that the phase pressures and the phase temperatures are equal at any cross-section appear consistent with experimental observations. The set of equations includes a momentum equation which has {{the form of a}} relaxation law of the drift velocity. This equation is based on a simplified version of the so-called Voinov - Berne equation for the momentum of the gas in a bubbly flow. The ability of the model to predict steady state <b>critical</b> <b>flows</b> is tested first. This is done by means of an analysis of the sensitivity to variations of the main parameters, and also by comparing the results with two sets of original experimental data on air-water <b>critical</b> <b>flows.</b> Finally, the model is tested in transient conditions, modelling the water hammer phenomena.

40|$|AbstractTime-independent {{swirling}} {{flows in}} rotationally symmetric pipes of constant and varying diameter {{are constructed using}} variational techniques. <b>Critical</b> <b>flows</b> in pipes of uniform cross section are found by extremizing the cross-sectional energy at constrained value of the cross-sectional helicity and the axial how rate. Discrete classes of hows are found explicitly, parameterized by the radius {{and the value of}} the cross-sectional helicity. These flows are steady Beltrami-type hows and are independent of the axial co-ordinate. Solution branches can show the phenomenon of flow-reversal at the central axis of the pipe: the axial velocity becomes negative with increasing radius. An approximation for swirling flows in a pipe with varying circular cross section is constructed in a quasi-homogeneous way as a succession in the axial direction of <b>critical</b> <b>flows</b> in uniform pipes. With the changing value of the radius, the value of the cross-sectional helicity is determined by the requirement that the approximation satisfies the correct energy and flux conservation. It will be shown that these requirements are equivalent to satisfying the necessary solvability conditions that arise from a perturbation analysis around the quasi-homogeneous approximation. The approximate flows have the property that in lowest order approximation the local cross-sectional energy density increases linearly with R, while the local cross-sectional helicity density is constant...|$|R
