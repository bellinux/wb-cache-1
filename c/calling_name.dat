50|$|In general, CID as {{transmitted}} from {{the origin of}} the call is only the calling party's full phone number (including area code, and including international access code and country code if it's an international call). The calling party name is added by the consumer's terminating central office if the consumer has subscribed to that service. <b>Calling</b> <b>name</b> delivery is not automatic. A SS7 (or Signalling System 7) TCAP query may be launched by the called party's central office, in order to retrieve the information for <b>Calling</b> <b>Name</b> delivery to the caller ID equipment at the consumer's location, if the caller's name has not already been associated with the calling party's line at the originating central office. Canadian systems using CCS7 automatically (but not in all cases) send the <b>calling</b> <b>name</b> with the call set-up and routing information {{at the time of the}} call.|$|E
2500|$|A dog {{qualifying}} for a championship at a conformation show has the designation Champion or [...] "Ch."

The Best in Show winner of the 2008 Crufts show (UK), for example, was a Giant Schnauzer, Ch. Jafrak Philippe Olivier, <b>call</b> <b>name</b> Philip.

5000|$|In Sweden, {{a person}} {{must have a}} surname and one or more given names. Two given names are common. Surnames are {{inherited}} from the parents, {{in the order of}} [...] "same as elder sibling, if any; specified by parents; or mother's last name," [...] while given names must be chosen by the parents at birth. The <b>calling</b> <b>name</b> (Swedish tilltalsnamn, French Prénom usuel) by which the person is normally identified in conversation, is in Scandinavian countries (and previously in France) one of the given names, not necessarily the first. In contexts where the full name is spelled out, the <b>calling</b> <b>name</b> is often indicated by an asterisk, by capital letters, or underlines or italics. For example, Märta Birgit* Nilsson is known as Birgit Nilsson, while Agnetha* Åse Fältskog is known as Agnetha Fältskog.|$|E
50|$|Because of the {{mechanisms}} used by signaling methods prior to SS7 (battery reversal, multi-frequency digit outpulsing, A- and B-bit signaling), these older methods could not communicate much signaling information. Usually only the dialed digits were signaled, and merely during call setup. For charged calls, dialed digits and charge number digits were outpulsed. SS7, being a high-speed and high-performance packet-based communications protocol, can communicate {{significant amounts of}} information when setting up a call, during the call, {{and at the end}} of the call. This permits rich call-related services to be developed. Some of the first such services were call management related, call forwarding (busy and no answer), voice mail, call waiting, conference calling, <b>calling</b> <b>name</b> and number display, call screening, malicious caller identification, busy callback.|$|E
5000|$|Abu Ghanim was {{the brother}} of Prince Grigor I of Taron, and was himself the de facto ruler of about {{one half of the}} principality. Like other Armenian figures of the period, he is only known to history by his Arabic name, over which {{opinions}} vary: some scholars consider it a mere nickname or <b>calling</b> <b>name,</b> others consider it a proper baptismal name. According to the De administrando imperio of the Byzantine emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos (r. 913-959), Abu Ghanim and his nephews, the [...] "sons of Arkaikas"—"Arkaikas" [...] has been identified with either Ashot II of Taron or his father David—accompanied the Byzantine emissary Constantine Lips to the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, during the reign of Leo VI the Wise (r. 886-912) and received the rank of protospatharios. The visit was repeated sometime after, variously dated by modern scholars at ca. 900 or between 906 and Leo's death in 912. During this visit, Abu Ghanim received the title of patrikios, and a marriage between Abu Ghanim and the daughter of Constantine Lips was arranged. The wedding never took place, however, because Abu Ghanim died during a journey to his homeland, before he could return to Constantinople. Abu Ghanim was apparently already married once, for he is recorded as having one or more underage sons {{at the time of his}} death: his only clearly attested son is Tornikes, but there were possibly more, who are named in modern Armenian sources as Vahan and Smbat.|$|E

40|$|Showing all {{names of}} J. K. Tyl’s {{characters}} {{was not the}} purpose of this paper. I wanted to refer to characteristic naming tendencies, to some interesting cases and especially to factors influencing the choice of names. I can illustrate it on the example of the name Krvomír: the selection of this name is conditioned by the literary genre (it is a typical kind of name in a fairy tale), by contemporary poetics (it was a very popular kind of name in literature of the 1830 s and 1840 s), by function (a <b>calling</b> <b>name</b> characterizes the character by using the semantic meaning of the name: “krev” means blood in Czech). The form of the name is also very interesting, it corresponds with old Slavonic names (cp. Jaromír, Vladimír, Mojmír). However, the name Krvomír is not documented in reality, it is an invention of J. K. Tyl. The creation of this concrete name was influenced by author’s poetics and his inventive approach to names {{within the framework of the}} particular naming scheme...|$|E
40|$|The play on nicknames {{is one of}} the {{linguistic}} phenomena that was emerged in Sasak community. The problems that are found in this research are; the various shapes of the play on nicknames in the Sasak community, the factor behind the surfacing of the play on nicknames in the Sasak community, the cultural function of the use of nickname play in the Sasak community, and its relevance in highschool Indonesia language study. This research is a descriptive qualitative study. This gathering of data has been carried out throught various techniques such as interview, observation, and documentation. The method of data analysis was done through directly describing the research data then making a conclusion based on the data that was previously gained. The various shapes of the play on nicknames in Sasak community are formed as protesis, monoftongisation, paragog, neutralization, vocal modification, aferesis, epentesis, and apokop. The factors behind the surfacing of the play on nicknames in the Sasak community includes 1) simplifying <b>calling</b> <b>name,</b> 2) familiarity, 3) dialect usage. The cultural funcion of the use of nicknames play in the sasak community includes: 1) effectiveness, 2) disformality, 3) maintainance of familiarity...|$|E
