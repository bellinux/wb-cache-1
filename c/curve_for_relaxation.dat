40|$|The {{relative}} {{effects of}} drugs which elevate cytosolic cyclic AMP on inotropy and diastolic relaxation (lusitropy) of guinea pig atna were quantified in vitro. There was a temporal {{difference between these}} responses in that inotropy reached peak response consid-erably faster than lusitropy. Also, although the relaxation re-sponse was sustained to an elevated steady state, the inotropic responses to beta adrenoceptor agonists were transient and returned to base line over 90 mm. However, the inotropic re-sponses to forskolin and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (cAMP) were sustained. For all of the drugs tested, the lusitropic response was at least 4 times more sensitive than the inotropic response (i. e., the concentration response <b>curve</b> <b>for</b> <b>relaxation</b> was shifted {{to the left of}} the curve for inotropy). In the case of beta adreno-ceptor agonists, these differences were greater, presumabl...|$|E
40|$|Stable URL: [URL] An {{association}} {{has been shown}} between raised serum antibody levels to 65 kDa heat-shock protein (Hsp 65) and vascular diseases suggesting that it might {{play a role in}} its pathogenesis. It was the aim of this study to investigate the effects of Hsp 65 on the vasculature. Methods. Male Dark Agouti rats were either immunised with 200 gg Hsp 65 kDa in Freunds Incomplete Adjuvant on day 14 only (Hsp group) or with 10 ' Mycobacterium vaccae on day 0 and Hsp 65 on day 14 (My group). Six rats were used as controls. Four animals were sacrificed at 4 weeks following immunization, the others, including the control, after 10 weeks. Rings of thoracic aorta were assessed for contraction and relaxation in response to phenylephrine and acetylcholine using an organ bath technique. The distal thoracic aorta was used for histology to determine intima/media thickness. Thl/Th 2 status (IFNy/IL- 10) was also assessed using flow cytometry. Results. The Hsp group showed significantly increased contractility both at 4 and 10 weeks. In the MV group at 4 weeks, contractility was significantly decreased, but rose again after 10 weeks. The dose-response <b>curve</b> <b>for</b> <b>relaxation</b> in both groups was not significantly different from the control, suggesting intact endothelial nitric oxide synthesis. No significant difference could be found in intima/media thickness in both groups. The cytokine expression was shifted from Thl towards a Th 2 status at 4 weeks in the Hsp group. The MV group, however, showed a shift from Th 2 to Thl 1 status at 4 weeks. Both were reversed again after 10 weeks. Conclusions. This study has shown a change in vasocontractility produced by immunization with Hsp 65; short-term this could be reversed with MV. Similar short-term changes could be seen in the Thl 1 /Th 2 status. This novel finding may have implications for understanding the aetiology of vasospastic disorders and may open new ideas for therapeutic strategies modifying the Th I /Th 2 status in vascular patients...|$|E

40|$|Systemically {{administered}} iodinated angiographic {{contrast media}} evoke vasodilatation through mechanisms {{that are at}} present poorly understood. In the current investigation we have evaluated {{the role of the}} vascular endothelium in responses to an iso-osmolar formation of the non-ionic dimer iodixanol and a hyperosmolar formulation of the non-ionic monomer iopromide. Isolated rabbit aortic ring preparations with endothelium intact or removed by gentle abrasion were mounted in organ baths containing oxygenated Holman's solution, and cumulative concentration–response <b>curves</b> <b>for</b> <b>relaxation</b> to the contrast media were constructed after pre-constriction by phenylephrine (300 nM) in the presence of indomethacin to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. Endothelial denudation did not influence the ability of either iodixanol or iopromide to relax the aortic ring preparations. Iopromide was significantly more potent than iodixanol when expressed in terms of iodine concentration (mg I ml− 1), but both agents were equipotent when expressed in terms of molarity (mM). We conclude that relaxation of isolated rabbit aortic rings to iodixanol and iopromide under conditions where there is no fluid flow is endothelium-independent, and therefore not mediated by release of the potent endogeneous nitrovasodilator endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF). Furthermore, their relaxant activity under the in vitro experimental conditions employed is attributable to a direct action on vascular smooth muscle by factors in addition to osmolality, and may depend on features that are not specifically associated with the presence of the iodine atom...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{designed}} to investigate {{the importance of the}} endothelium in the relaxation of isolated rat aorta caused by a beta adrenoceptor agonist. Mechanical removal of the endothe-hum attenuated the relaxation induced by isoproterenol (ISO) and did not affect the relaxation produced by forskolin and by sodium nitroprusside. High concentrations of ISO produced an increase in the resting tension of aortic strips with and without endothelium in a concentration-dependent manner. Mechanical removal of the endothelium or treatment with methylene blue enhanced the maximal contraction induced by ISO. Phentolamine antagonized the contractile responses induced by ISO.

40|$|The {{freezing}} of {{the cooperative}} reorientational motions in orientationally disordered (OD) molecular crystals marks the so-called glassy transition, {{which may be}} considered a lower-dimensional version of the structural glass transition. Although structural glasses display both positional and orientational disorder, in orientational glasses, however, the disorder involves exclusively the orientational degrees of freedom of the constituent molecules, while the molecular centers of mass form an ordered lattice. We report here on a glass-forming system with even fewer degrees of freedom, namely, the OD phase of a dipolar benzene derivative, pentachloronitrobenzene (C 6 Cl 5 NO 2). We probe the orientational dynamics of pentachloronitrobenzene {{as a function of}} temperature and pressure by means of dielectric spectroscopy (and high-pressure density measurements), and we show that, due to its anisotropy, the system exhibits a double primary relaxation feature associated with two distinct motions of the molecular dipole moment. This complex relaxation scenario shows a scaled dependence on the thermodynamic variables (P,T), with all relaxation times collapsing onto a single <b>curve</b> <b>for</b> each <b>relaxation</b> when plotted versus a specific-volume-dependent scaled variable TVπ.

40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} on isolated canine and human coronary arteries to provide more insight into the mechanisms responsible for the vascular tolerance to nitroglycerin that is induced under in vitro or in vivo conditions.

After elevation of tone with KCl (15 mM), dose-response <b>curves</b> were constructed <b>for</b> nitroglycerin or SIN 1 (3 -morpholino-syndonimin) on control and tolerant rings. On canine tolerant rings the dose-response <b>curve</b> <b>for</b> nitroglycerin-induced <b>relaxations</b> was significantly (p < 0. 001) shifted to the right, and 50 % of the maximal relaxation (ED 50) increased from 55 ± 9 nM to 1. 2 ± 0. 2 μM. Pretreatment of tolerant rings with N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 10 μM 10 min before KCl-induced contraction) partially restored the responsiveness to nitroglycerin, with ED 50 reducing to 0. 56 ± 0. 03 μM (p < 0. 02). O) n the other hand, the dose-response curves to SIN 1 were not significantly altered. Similar results were obtained on human preparations. On isolated canine coronary rings rendered tolerant in vivo by subcutaneous injections of 15 mg/kg nitroglycerin (two times daily for 4 consecutive days), ED 50 for nitroglycerin was 0. 67 ± 0. 08 μM (p < 0. 001 versus control rings), and NAC again partially restored the reponsiveness to nitroglycerin. As for the in vitro tolerance, the relaxations to SIN 1 were not significantly altered on these canine rings rendered nitrate tolerant in vivo. The present {{results show that the}} responsiveness to SIN 1 is not modified on nitrate tolerant rings and that the mechanisms responsible for nitrate tolerance are similar under both in vivo and in vitro conditions.

40|$|I {{investigate}} the frequency dependence of attenuation and problems with measuring the intrinsic attenuation in reflection data. It {{is well established}} that in many materials attenuation is approximately linear with frequency over the bandwidth of the GPR signal, with a slope characterized by a constant Q* parameter. I show the relationship of Q * to the parameters describing Cole-Cole relaxation and that when the dominant GPR frequency is well above or below the primary relaxation frequency, Q * is a simple function of the ratio of real to imaginary parts of the dielectric permittivity. However, near the relaxation frequency, a more complicated function is required to describe {{the slope of the}} attenuation <b>curve.</b> <b>For</b> some materials <b>relaxation</b> occurs in the range from 10 - 200 MHz which is in the primary range that GPR operates for many applications.

40|$|Purpose The human {{physiological}} {{bladder contraction}} is largely mediated by acetylcholine acting on muscarinic receptors, but in pathophysiological settings the relative role of non-cholinergic stimuli gains importance. beta-Adrenoceptor agonists {{are currently in}} clinical development as treatments for the overactive bladder syndrome. Therefore, we have explored {{the ability of the}} beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline to induce rat isolated bladder strip relaxation on pre-contraction with the muscarinic agonist carbachol as compared to bladder tone induced by several non-cholinergic stimuli. Methods Bladder tone was induced by passive tension, receptor independently by KCl, carbachol, bradykinin or serotonin. Concentration-response <b>curves</b> were generated <b>for</b> <b>relaxation</b> by isoprenaline, and a single concentration of the receptor-independent relaxant forskolin was also tested. Results The various contractile stimuli induced different degrees of bladder tone, but the ability of isoprenaline or forskolin to relax rat bladder was not correlated with the degree of tone. Isoprenaline was significantly less potent and effective in causing relaxation against carbachol-induced tone than against any other stimulus, whereas no such relationship was observed for forskolin. Conclusions We conclude that beta-adrenoceptor agonists can induce rat bladder relaxation against a wide range of contractile stimuli and are more potent and/or effective against non-cholinergic stimuli than against muscarinic agonism.

40|$|PF 9404 C is the S-S diesteroisomer {{of a novel}} blocker of beta {{adrenergic}} receptors with vasodilatory properties.

It was equipotent to nitroglycerin (NTG; IC 50 49 [*]nM), but much more potent than isosorbide dinitrate (ISD; IC 50 15, 000 [*]nM). Oxyhaemoglobin (10 [*]μM) shifted to the right the concentration-response <b>curve</b> <b>for</b> the <b>relaxation</b> induced by PF 9404 C (IC 50 530 [*]nM) or NTG (IC 50 61 [*]nM). Either methylene blue (MB) or ODQ (1 [*]μM each) largely prevented the vasorelaxing responses to increasing concentrations of PF 9404 C or NTG. In rat aorta smooth muscle cells, PF 9404 C increased the formation of cyclic GMP from 3 pmol[*]mg− 1 protein in basal conditions, to 53 [*]pmol[*]mg− 1 protein in 10 [*]μM PF 9404 C. Neither metoprolol nor carvedilol enhanced cyclic GMP. In the electrically driven guinea-pig left atrium, PF 9404 C blocked the inotropic effects of isoprenaline in a concentration-dependent manner. Its IC 50 (30 [*]nM) {{was similar to that}} for S-propranolol (22. 4 [*]nM) and lower than the IC 50 s for metoprolol (120 [*]nM) and atenolol (192 [*]nM). The beta-adrenergic ligand (−) -[3 H]-CGP 12177 (0. 2 [*]nM) was displaced from its binding to rat brain membranes with Ki of 7 [*]nM, 17 [*]nM, 170 [*]nM and 1. 2 [*]μM respectively for PF 9404 C, S-(−) propranolol, metoprolol, and atenolol. The data are consistent with the idea that the S-S diesteroisomer PF 9404 C, is a potent vasorelaxing agent, as well as a blocker of cardiac beta adrenergic receptors. The mechanism of its vasorelaxing effects involves the slow generation of NO.
