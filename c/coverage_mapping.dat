40|$|Abstract — Exploration and mapping {{belongs to}} the {{fundamental}} tasks of mobile robots. In the past, many approaches have used occupancy grid maps to represent the environment during the map building process. Occupancy grids, however, {{are based on the}} assumption that each cell is either occupied or free. In this paper we introduce <b>coverage</b> <b>maps</b> as an alternative way of representing the environment of a robot. <b>Coverage</b> <b>maps</b> store for each cell of a given grid a posterior about the amount the corresponding cell is covered by an obstacle. We also present a model that allows us to update <b>coverage</b> <b>maps</b> upon input obtained from proximity sensors. We furthermore describe how to use <b>coverage</b> <b>maps</b> for a decision theoretic approach to exploration. Finally we present experimental results illustrating that <b>coverage</b> <b>maps</b> can be used to efficiently learn highly accurate models even if noisy sensors such as ultrasounds are used.

30|$|We use {{the nearest}} <b>map</b> and the <b>coverage</b> <b>map</b> {{to reduce the}} {{graphics}} memory used for the temporal shadow map. Both the nearest <b>map</b> and the <b>coverage</b> <b>map</b> have the same resolution as the shadow map (1024  ×  768). For each pixel, the nearest map stores two 32 -bit floating point values and the <b>coverage</b> <b>map</b> holds a single 32 -bit floating point value. So it requires about 9  MB memory for both maps. The graphics memory used for the temporal shadow map relies {{on the number of}} visible time ranges stored at each pixel.|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} mapping {{the extent of}} “usable” {{coverage}} of an existing wireless network is important in {{a large number of}} applications, including communicating the abilities of the network to users, identifying coverage gaps and planning expansion, discovering opportunities for spectrum reuse, and determining possible sources of interference with other networks. This thesis addresses fundamental but unsolved problems of measurement-based wireless coverage mapping: where should measurements be made, how many are necessary, and what can be said about the coverage at points that have not been measured. To address these problems, this thesis advocates a geostatistical approach using optimized spatial sampling and ordinary Kriging. A complete system for <b>coverage</b> <b>mapping</b> is developed that systematically addresses measurement, sampling, spatial modeling, interpolation, and visualization. This geostatistical method is able to produce more accurate and robust coverage maps than {{the current state of the}} art methods, and is able to discover coverage holes as effectively as dedicated heuristic methods using a small number of measurements. Several important practical extensions are investigated: applying these methods to drive-test measurements which have been resampled to alleviate effects from sampling bias, and crowd-sourced <b>coverage</b> <b>mapping</b> applications where volunteer-collected measurements may be sparse or infrequent. The resulting maps can then be refined iteratively, and updated systematically over time using an optimized iterative sampling scheme. An extensive validation is performed using measurements of production WiFi, WiMax, GSM, and LTE networks in representative urban and suburban outdoor environments...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Metropolitan area {{wireless}} {{networks are}} currently being deployed in major cities around the world, whilst in tandem {{there has been much}} research into vehicle-to-roadside communication. New applications for vehicular networking become possible as blanket, low-cost, wireless networks begin to exist across cities, resulting in Connected Traffic, rather than isolated Connected Cars. We classify these applications according to their distinguishing characteristics, and discuss their network architecture requirements. We outline our current work on the language and compiler support required in order to deploy applications on such networks, and how <b>coverage</b> <b>mapping</b> algorithms will enable better prediction of network conditions to optimise such deployments. We conclude that such analysis and tools are important for defining the future of wireless access for the road network. I...|$|E

However, compared to the detection of SNPs and small indels, characterizing large and particularly complex structural variation {{is much more difficult}} and less intuitive. In this article, we present a new scheme (inGAP-sv) to detect and visualize structural variation from paired-end mapping data. Under this scheme, abnormally mapped read pairs are clustered based on the location of a gap signature. Several important features, including local depth of <b>coverage,</b> <b>mapping</b> quality and associated tandem repeat, are used to evaluate the quality of predicted structural variation. Compared with other approaches, it can detect many more large insertions and complex variants with lower false discovery rate. Moreover, inGAP-sv, written in Java programming language, provides a user-friendly interface and can be performed in multiple operating systems. It can be freely accessed at [URL]...|$|E

According to the spatial rela-tionship, neighbor nodes are mapping to several overlapped sectors.

Then, the max radius of each sector is computed according to the path loss model and the given signal attenuation thre-shold. Finally, all the sectors are overlapped to estimate the node radio coverage. Experimental results show that the method is simple and effectively improve the prediction accuracy of the sensor node radio coverage...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In general, {{remote sensing}} {{provides}} important <b>coverage,</b> <b>mapping</b> and classification of land-cover features, such as vegetation, soil, water and forests. A chief use of remotely sensed data {{is to produce}} a classification map of the identifiable or meaningful features or classes of land cover types in a scene. As a result, the chief product is a thematic map with themes such as land use, geology and vegetation types. In the field of remote sensing, image classification is {{a process in which}} pixels or the basic units of an image are assigned to classes. By comparing pixels to one another and to those of known identity, it is possible to assemble groups of similar pixels into classes that match the informational categories of interest to users of remotely sensed data. Numerous methods of image classification exist and classification has formed an important part of not only remote sensing, but also of the fields of image analysis and pattern recognition. Classification results from applying the Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA) were assessed by comparison with ground-truth data. SMA was performed and evaluated based onLandsat- 7 ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) data...|$|E
40|$|The {{recently}} declared Australian Commonwealth Marine Reserve (CMR) Network {{covers a}} total of 3. 1 million km 2 of continental shelf, slope, and abyssal habitat. Managing and con-serving the biodiversity values within this network requires knowledge of the physical and biological assets that lie within its boundaries. Unfortunately very {{little is known about}} the habitats and biological assemblages of the continental shelf within the network, where diversity is richest and anthropogenic pressures are greatest. Effective management of the CMR estate into the future requires this knowledge gap to be filled efficiently and quantita-tively. The challenge is particularly great for the shelf as multibeam echosounder (MBES) mapping, a key tool for identifying and quantifying habitat distribution, is time consuming in shallow depths, so full <b>coverage</b> <b>mapping</b> of the CMR shelf assets is unrealistic in the medium-term.

5000|$|Often <b>coverage</b> <b>maps</b> show general <b>coverage</b> {{for large}} regions and {{therefore}} any boundary indicated {{should not be}} interpreted as a rigid limit. The biggest cause of uncertainty for a <b>coverage</b> <b>map</b> is the quality (mainly sensitivity) of receiving apparatus used. A <b>coverage</b> <b>map</b> may be produced to indicate the area in which a certain signal strength is delivered. Even if it is 100% accurate (which it never is), a major factor on whether a signal is receivable depends very much on whether the receiving apparatus is sensitive enough to use a signal of that level. Commercial receivers can vary widely in their sensitivity, thus perception of coverage can vary widely.|$|R

40|$|International audienceSpatial data {{production}} and diffusion {{have been going}} through major developments since the digital transition of the 1990 s, which translated {{in the emergence of}} new institutions organising their circulation: Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI). In this new informational system, the notion of " sharing " is at the centre of the debates. But it is a contradictory ideology carrying divergent societal projects: some may think it encourages public transparency and informational democracy, and others that it compensates the State's inadequacy by favouring the participation of citizens in managing territories. This article on information geography offers a critical reading of the new modes of circulation of institutional spatial knowledge, by understanding spatial data sharing practices within SDIs, by comparing European and South American cases and analysing their effects in terms of spatial justice: citizens' access to information, improvement at territorial level of information <b>coverage,</b> <b>mapping</b> capacities of local specificities. SDIs seem to contribute especially to the reconstitution of the State's role, where in certain contexts they can favour the democratisation of territorialised public policies, and reinforce national sovereignty. They turn out to be far more paradoxical in their local effects: implementing a sharing process sometimes supposes a reinforcement of the exclusion forms of certain groups, and a normalisation preventing the expression of genuine territorial representations...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to map the}} {{vegetation}} communities at the ice-free areas of Potter Peninsula at Maritime Antarctica using satellite image classification. We used a recent Quickbird image for digital classification. The image was georreferenced with orthorectification using terrain control points obtained in the field with a Leica DGPS, coupled with a digital elevation model. We used the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) for help in {{the vegetation}} class discrimination. In the image classification, we adopted the Maxver classifier (maximum verossimilarity), in which the training samples were demarcated based on field observations and intensive plant collection between February and March 2008. The vegetation communities were adapted from Longton (1967), based on local variations. The NDVI offers {{a clear distinction between}} the surfaces according to the spectral response difference of the infrared and red bands. The vegetation communities occupy approximately 23 % of the ice free area. Lichens and mosses sub-formation covered the largest exposed areas.

The feasibility and safety of continuous (0. 4 - 2 Hz) and dynamic (at the site of and synchronized with tissue resection) subcortical motor mapping was evaluated. METHODS The authors prospectively studied 69 patients who underwent tumor surgery adjacent to the CST (< 1 cm using diffusion tensor imaging and fiber tracking) with simultaneous subcortical monopolar motor mapping (short train, interstimulus interval 4 msec, pulse duration 500 μsec) and a new acoustic motor evoked potential alarm. Continuous (temporal coverage) and dynamic (spatial <b>coverage)</b> <b>mapping</b> was technically realized by integrating the mapping probe {{at the tip of}} a new suction device, with the concept that this device will be in contact with the tissue where the resection is performed.
