25|$|In an {{epilogue}} to Foundation's Triumph, Brin noted he <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> {{himself or}} a different author writing another sequel {{to add to}} Foundation's Triumph, feeling that Hari Seldon's story was not yet necessarily finished. He later published a possible start of such a book on his website.|$|E
25|$|In another short, Little Beau Pepé, Pepé, {{attempting}} {{to find the}} most arousing cologne with which to impress Penelope, sprays a combination of perfumes and colognes upon himself. This resulted in something close to a love-potion, leading Penelope to fall madly in love with Pepé in an explosion of hearts. Pepé is revealed to be extremely frightened of overly-affectionate women ("But Madame!"), much to his dismay, as Penelope quickly captures him and smothers him in more love than even he <b>could</b> <b>imagine.</b>|$|E
25|$|One {{difference}} between painters in Mexico and their European counterparts {{is that they}} preferred realistic directness and clarity over fantastic colors, elongated proportions and extreme spatial relationships. The goal {{was to create a}} realistic scene in which the viewer <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> himself a part of. This was a style created by Caravaggio in Italy, which became popular with artists in Seville, from which many migrants came to New Spain came. Similarly, Baroque free standing sculptures feature life-size scales, realistic skin tones and the simulation of gold-threaded garments through a technique called estofado, the application of paint over gold leaf.|$|E

25|$|Gleason {{was raised}} by his mother. When she died in 1935 of sepsis from a large neck {{carbuncle}} (which young Jackie had tried to lance), Gleason was 19, he had nowhere to go, and he had 36 cents to his name. The family of his first girlfriend, Julie Dennehy, offered to take him in; Gleason, however, was headstrong and insisted {{that he was going}} {{into the heart of the}} city. His friend Sammy Birch made room for him in the hotel room he shared with another comedian. Birch also told him of a weeklong gig in Reading, Pennsylvania, that would pay $19, more money than Gleason <b>could</b> <b>imagine.</b> The booking agent advanced him bus fare for the trip against his salary. This was Gleason's first job as a professional comedian; henceforth, he would always have regular work in small clubs.|$|E
25|$|With the {{establishment}} of the socialist Folkhemmet (the people's home) and the Rehn-Meidner model Jämtland became a true neglected area in Sweden. The model deemed it necessary to concentrate the Swedish population in cities, at the coast and in the south. Jämtland an inland region in Norrland with the largest part of the population living in the countryside in Sweden was by far the most unprofitable region one <b>could</b> <b>imagine.</b> When the politics were launched Jämtland experienced the largest population loss in modern Swedish history. Local companies were forced into bankruptcy and unemployed people were encouraged to move to cities at the coast or in the south through subsidies and governmental commercials. At the same time taxes were rising and the public sector growing. Opposition to the loss of population and the centralist plans among officials regarding Jämtland County {{led to the creation of}} the Republic of Jamtland (see below).|$|E

500|$|Dave Gibbons {{became an}} adviser on Snyder's film, but Moore {{has refused to}} have his name {{attached}} to any film adaptations of his work. Moore has stated he {{has no interest in}} seeing Snyder's adaptation; he told Entertainment Weekly in 2008 that [...] "here are things that we did with Watchmen that could only work in a comic, and were indeed designed to show off things that other media can't". While Moore believes that David Hayter's screenplay was [...] "as close as I <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> anyone getting to Watchmen", he asserted he did not intend to see the film if it were made.|$|E
500|$|... "Our Town" [...] {{was written}} by future {{executive}} producer Frank Spotnitz and directed by Rob Bowman. The episode was Spotnitz's first stand-alone episode for the show. He had wanted to do an episode about cannibalism occurring at a chicken processing plant, thinking {{it was one of}} the most despicable and vile things he <b>could</b> <b>imagine.</b> Spotnitz was inspired by the Spencer Tracy movie Bad Day at Black Rock, which is about a town holding a terrible secret. He was also inspired by an article he read at UCLA about salamanders getting sick from eating other salamanders; Spotnitz's brother later suggested him to include the theme in the episode.|$|E

500|$|In contrast, {{the renowned}} 20th century Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges, who {{admitted}} Poe {{as a strong}} influence, praised the novel as [...] "Poe's greatest work". H. G. Wells noted that [...] "Pym tells what a very intelligent mind <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> about the south polar region a century ago". Even so, most scholars did not engage in much serious discussion or analysis of the novel until the 1950s, though many in France recognized the work much earlier. In 2013, The Guardian cited The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket {{as one of the}} greatest novels ever written in English, and noted its influence on later authors such as Henry James, Arthur Conan Doyle, B. Traven, and David Morrell.|$|E
500|$|Lydia Hand was an {{involved}} and protective mother, {{who had been}} influenced by a Calvinist aunt as a child; and she passed on {{a strong sense of}} duty and guilt to her only son. Learned Hand eventually came to understand the influences of his parents as formative. After his father's death, he looked to religion to help him cope, writing to his cousin Augustus Noble Hand: [...] "If you <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> one half the comfort my religion has given to me in this terrible loss, you would see that Christ never forsakes those who cling to him." [...] The depth of Hand's early religious convictions was in sharp contrast to his later agnosticism.|$|E

Hutchins said [...] "I offered him options and, in some cases, multiple choices. We agreed to meet at the Warner Bros. gate near the water tower in 20 minutes." [...] He recorded the sound to a tape and met Hillenburg by the gate. Hutchins said [...] "He was about as happy as you <b>could</b> <b>imagine,</b> and off he went. Next thing you know, I am working on the show." [...] Hutchins became the regular series sound designer.|$|E
500|$|According to Dave Mustaine, {{the band}} have {{encountered}} numerous mishaps and odd occurrences. In {{an interview with}} Terrorizer magazine, Mustaine, taking note of the connection to the unlucky number 13, explained [...] "This is our 13th studio record, and we've already {{had a bunch of}} weird things happen. Car problems, stuff disappearing, a guy who worked for me that was the most white-laced guy you <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> falling out on drugs and disappearing... but this one's got me excited!" [...] In addition, Mustaine announced on Twitter that producer Johnny K was [...] "suddenly struck ill", and the band had ceased recording for the time being. However, the band resumed recording a few days later, with K having apparently recovered. In an interview, Drover had said nothing weird occurred until after he finished recording drum tracks for the album.|$|E
500|$|Gray {{wanted the}} film to be as {{realistic}} as possible; accordingly, the actors did most of their own stunts, and computer-generated imagery was used very sparingly. The second unit, under director Alexander Witt and cinematographer Josh Bleibtreu, filmed establishing shots, the Venice canal chase sequence, and the Los Angeles chase sequence {{over a period of}} 40 days. Filming on location posed some challenges. The opening heist sequence in Venice, Italy, was strictly monitored by the local authorities, due to the high speeds the boats were driven at. The frigid temperatures at Passo Fedaia in the Italian Alps created problems during production: [...] "The guns would jam, and if you <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> not being able to walk 40 feet with a bottle of water without it freezing, those are the conditions we had to work in," [...] Gray remarked. Pedestrians had to be allowed to use the sidewalks of Hollywood Boulevard between takes. Also, scenes which took place on freeways and city streets were only filmed on weekends.|$|E

500|$|In early 1998, the Red Hot Chili Peppers fired guitarist Dave Navarro {{and were}} on the verge of {{breaking}} up. Flea told Kiedis, [...] "the only way I <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> carrying on [...] is if we got John back in the band." [...] With Frusciante free of his addictions and ailments, Kiedis and Flea thought it was an appropriate time to invite him back. When Flea visited him at his home and asked him to rejoin the band, Frusciante began sobbing and said [...] "nothing would make me happier in the world." [...] With Frusciante back on guitar, the Chili Peppers began recording their next album, Californication, released in 1999. Frusciante's return restored a key component of the Chili Peppers' sound, as well as a healthy morale. He brought with him his deep devotion to music, which affected the band's recording style during the album. Frusciante has frequently stated that his work on Californication was his favorite.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{had mixed}} {{opinions}} on the characters. Generally, reviewers liked the character interactions. IGN praised the diverse characters but panned Milla's english voice acting. Game Revolution felt the characters were relatable and agreed with IGN about Milla's voice noting it sounded robotic and forced. Electronic Gaming Monthly described the characters as rather normal and competent compared to the previous Tales games, adding that they <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> the cast having lives and dreams outside of the party's journey. Edge described the character interactions as engaging, well written, and praised how the characters avoided the cliché found in manga and anime. Oppositely, PlayStation Official Magazine felt the characters [...] "fall into the familiar anime archtypes" [...] and that [...] "flat voice acting and a melodramatic script" [...] {{made it difficult to}} feel invested in the cast; Polygon agreed about the character archetypes and called it a lazy strategy used to make the characters understandable.|$|E
500|$|Soon after Bannister {{pronounced}} Hendrix dead, {{a hospital}} spokesperson told the press: [...] "We don't know where, how, or why he died, but {{he died of}} an overdose." [...] By that evening, many newspapers in London and New York had printed sensationalized headlines that exploited the death-from-overdose account. Hendrix's public relations manager, Les Perrin, granted an interview on Dutch radio soon after the hospital announcement. He commented: [...] "Well, all I know is that Mr. Hendrix's body was taken to St. Mary Abbots Hospital in Kensington, London, at 11:45 this morning, and he was certified to be dead on arrival." [...] At 2 p.m., BBC Radio 1 reported: [...] "Jimi Hendrix, regarded by millions {{as one of the}} most talented and original performers in modern rock music, is dead." [...] That evening, The New York Times described him as [...] "a genius black musician, a guitarist, singer and composer of brilliantly dramatic power.
