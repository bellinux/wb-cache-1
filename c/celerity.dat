25|$|Already in 1914, Wilton {{extended}} the Stokes expansion for deep-water surface gravity waves to tenth order, although introducing errors at the eight order. A fifth-order theory for finite depth was derived by De in 1955. For engineering use, the fifth-order formulations of Fenton are convenient, applicable to both Stokes {{first and second}} definition of phase speed (<b>celerity).</b> The demarcation between when fifth-order Stokes theory is preferable over fifth-order cnoidal wave theory is for Ursell parameters below about 40.|$|E
25|$|Stokes' first {{definition}} of wave <b>celerity</b> has, for a pure wave motion, the mean {{value of the}} horizontal Eulerian flow-velocity ŪE at any location below trough level equal to zero. Due to the irrotationality of potential flow, together with the horizontal sea bed and periodicity the mean horizontal velocity, the mean horizontal velocity is a constant between bed and trough level. So in Stokes first definition the wave is considered from a frame of reference moving with the mean horizontal velocity ŪE. This is an advantageous approach when the mean Eulerian flow velocity ŪE is known, e.g. from measurements.|$|E

25|$|Deep-water waves {{travel to}} shore and become shallow water waves. Shallow water waves have depths less than ½ of their wavelength. Shallow wave's {{wavelengths}} are long relative to water depth and have elliptical orbitals. The wave velocity effects the entire water basin. The water {{interacts with the}} bottom as it approaches shore and has a drag interaction. The drag interaction pulls {{on the bottom of}} the wave, causes refraction, increases the height, decreases the <b>celerity</b> (or the speed of the wave form), and the top (crest) falls over. This phenomenon happens because the velocity of the top of the wave is greater than the velocity of the bottom of the wave.|$|E
25|$|Stokes' second {{definition}} of wave <b>celerity</b> {{is for a}} frame of reference where the mean horizontal mass transport of the wave motion equal to zero. This {{is different from the}} first definition due to the mass transport in the splash zone, i.e. between the trough and crest level, in the wave propagation direction. This wave-induced mass transport is caused by the positive correlation between surface elevation and horizontal velocity. In the reference frame for Stokes' second definition, the wave-induced mass transport is compensated by an opposing undertow (so ŪE<nbsp&0 for waves propagating in the positive x-direction). This is the logical definition for waves generated in a wave flume in the laboratory, or waves moving perpendicular towards a beach.|$|E
25|$|The {{military}} career of Cato {{was not yet}} ended. In 191 BC, he, along with his old associate Lucius Valerius Flaccus, was appointed as a lieutenant-general under the Consul Manius Acilius Glabrio, who had been dispatched to Greece to oppose the invasion of Antiochus III the Great, King of the Seleucid Empire. In the decisive Battle of Thermopylae (191 BC), {{which led to the}} downfall of Antiochus, Cato behaved with his usual valor, and enjoyed good fortune. By a daring and difficult advance, he surprised and removed a body of the enemy's Aetolian auxiliaries, who were posted upon the Callidromus, the highest peak of the range of Mount Oeta. Then, coming to the aid of forces under Flaccus's command, he began a sudden descent from the hills above the royal camp, and the panic caused by this unexpected movement promptly turned the day in favor of the Romans, and signaled the end of the Seleucid invasion of Greece. After the action, the General hugged Cato with the greatest warmth and attributed to him the whole credit of the victory. That this is a fact rests on the authority of Cato himself, who, like Cicero, often indulged in the habit, offensive to modern taste, of sounding his own praises. After an interval spent in the pursuit of Antiochus and the pacification of Greece, Cato was sent to Rome by the Consul Glabrio to announce the successful outcome of the campaign, and he performed his journey with such <b>celerity</b> that he had started his report in the senate before the return of Lucius Cornelius Scipio, the later conqueror of Antiochus, who had been sent off from Greece a few days before him.|$|E
40|$|The closure {{problem of}} {{representing}} hydrological boundary fluxes {{given the state}} of the system has been described as the scientific ‘Holy Grail’ of hydrology. This relationship between storage state and flux should be hysteretic and scale dependent because of the differences between velocities and <b>celerities</b> in a hydrological system—effectively velocities are storage controlled, and <b>celerities</b> are controlled by storage deficits. To improve our {{understanding of the nature of}} these relationships a new hydrology model is used (the Multiple Interacting Pathways or MIPs model) to explore the influence of catchment scale on storage–flow–transport relationships, and their non-linearities. The MIPs model has been shown to produce acceptable simulations of both flow and tracer, i. e. of both <b>celerities</b> and velocities, at the Gårdsjön catchment in Sweden. In this study the model is used to simulate scaled versions of the Gårdsjön catchment to allow us for the first time to investigate the influence of scale on the non-linearities in storage–flow–transport relationships, and help us steer the quest for the scientific hydrological ‘Holy Grail’. The simulations reveal the influence of scale on flow response in the nature of storage–discharge hysteresis and its links with antecedent storage; fractal-like systematic change of mean output travel times with scale; the effect of scale on input, output and storage residence time distributions; hysteric relations between storage and output travel times and links between storage and water table level hysteresis...|$|R
40|$|Field and {{laboratory}} {{studies indicate that}} changes in riverbed morphology often lag changes in water discharge. This lagged response produces hysteresis {{in the relationship between}} water discharge and bed form geometry. To understand these phenomena, we performed flume experiments to observe the response of a sand bed to step increases and decreases in water discharge. For an abrupt rise in discharge, we observed that bed forms grew rapidly by collision and merger of bed forms migrating with different <b>celerities.</b> Growth rate slowed as bed forms approached equilibrium with the higher discharge regime. After an abrupt discharge drop, bed form decay occurred through formation of smaller secondary bed forms, in equilibrium with the lower discharge, which cannibalized the original, relict features. We present a simple model framework to quantitatively predict time scales of bed form adjustment to flow changes, based on equilibrium bed form heights, lengths, and <b>celerities</b> at low and high flows. For rising discharge, the model assumes that all bed form collisions result in irreversible merger, due to a dispersion of initial <b>celerities.</b> For falling discharge, we derive a diffusion model for the decay of relict high-stage features. Our models predict the form and time scale of experimental bed form adjustments. Additional experiments applying slow and fast triangular flood waves show that bed form hysteresis occurs only when the time scale of flow change is faster than the modeled (and measured) bed form adjustment time. We show that our predicted adjustment time scales {{can also be used to}} predict the occurrence of bed form hysteresis in natural floods...|$|R

40|$|This study {{advocates a}} {{mathematical}} framework of ''transport relations'' on a network. They single out {{a subset of}} ''traffic states'' described by time, duration, position and other traffic attributes (called ''monads'' for short). Duration evolutions are non-negative, decreasing toward zero for incoming durations, increasing from zero for outgoing durations, allowing the detection of ''junction states'' defined as traffic states with ''zero duration''. A ''junction relation'' (crossroads, synapses, clearing houses, etc.) Is {{a subset of the}} transport relation made of junction states? The objective is to construct a ''transport regulator'' associating with traffic states a set of ''celerities'' that mobiles circulating in the network can use as velocities. In other word, a network is regarded as a ''provider of velocity information'' to the mobiles for travelling from one departure state to an arrival state across a junction relation (a kind of geodesic problem). This investigation assumes that a system governs the evolution of monads in function of time, duration and position using <b>celerities</b> as controls and provides the transport regulator, a feedback from transport states to <b>celerities.</b> The proposed mathematical framework can acclimate road or aerial networks, endocrine (hormonal) or synaptic (neurotransmitters) networks, financial or economic networks, which motivated this investigation. This framework could probably accommodate computer and even social networks. This investigation is restricted to junctions between two routes. Comment: 26 page...|$|R

The musical number is used to [...] "compress dramatic time or narrate" [...] in a more compelling way than had solely dialogue been used.

According to the book Into the Closet: Cross-Dressing and the Gendered Body in Children's Literature and Film by Victoria Flanagan, Mulan is successful in retrieving the arrow because she uses [...] "an ingenuity that is based upon her ability to incorporate aspects of femininity into her masculine performance." [...] By the end of the scene, all of the soldiers have improved dramatically and the results of their practice and training are finally revealed.

40|$|Abstract This study {{investigates the}} {{sensitivity}} of floods to annual precipitation {{in space and time}} and evaluates quantitative signs of landscape-climate coevolution. For that purpose, a spatiotemporal sensitivity analysis is performed at regional scale using data from 804 catchments in Austria from 1976 to 2008. Results show that flood peaks are more responsive to spatial (regional) than to temporal (decadal) variability. Space-wise a 10 % increase in precipitation leads to a 23 % increase in flood peaks in Austria, whereas time-wise a 10 % increase in precipitation leads to an increase of just 6 % in flood peaks. Catchments from dry lowlands and high wetlands exhibit similarity between the spatial and temporal sensitivities (spatiotemporal symmetry) and low landscape-climate codependence. This suggests that such regions are not coevolving significantly. However, intermediate regions show differences between those sensitivities (symmetry breaks) and higher landscape-climate codependence, suggesting undergoing coevolution. A new coevolution index is then proposed relating spatiotemporal symmetry with relative characteristic <b>celerities.</b> The descriptive assessment of coevolution is complemented by a simple dynamical model of landscape-climate coevolu-tion, in which landform evolution processes take place at the millennial scale (slow dynamics), and climate adjusts in years to decades (fast dynamics). Coevolution is expressed by the interplay between slow and fast dynamics, represented, respectively, by spatial and temporal characteristics. The model captures key features of the joint landscape-climate distribution, supporting the descriptive assessment. This paper ulti-mately brings to light that coevolution needs {{to be taken into account}} through characteristic <b>celerities</b> in space-time trading of regional hydrology. 1...|$|R

Although the frequency spectra and normalized wavenumber spectra for these motions were particularly bland, wavenumber-frequency spectra of these data showed clear partitions of infragravity band energy levels associated with various wave types. For the frequencies 0. 025 < ƒ ≤ 0. 05 Hz, 45 ± 13 % of the shoreline variance was, on average, associated with high-mode (n ≥ 2) edge waves and/or leaky waves, while approximately half that amount was associated with low-mode edge waves. Gravity wave motions (comprising both edge and leaky modes) were typically dominant in a lower-frequency band (0. 001 < ƒ ≤ 0. 025 Hz). A {{substantial portion of the}} variance in this band (21 ± 10 %, with a maximum of 38 %), however, was identified as a nondispersive waveform with wavenumbers well outside of the wavenumber-frequency bounds for gravity waves. Surprisingly, this nongravity swash variance showed no significant dependence on mean alongshore current strength or mean alongshore current shear as measured in the surf zone trough separating the shoreline from an offshore bar. In addition, the <b>celerities</b> of these swash zone nondispersive waves were found to differ in magnitude, and in one instance, sign, from <b>celerities</b> of similarly structured waves measured farther offshore in the surf zone.
