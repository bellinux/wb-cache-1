5|$|In 2012, b's upper {{atmosphere}} was observed transiting the star; so its inclination is about 85 degrees, <b>coplanar</b> with 55 Cancri e. This helped to constrain {{the mass of}} the planet but the inclination was too low to constrain its radius.|$|E
5|$|In January 2009, {{the mutual}} {{inclination}} between planets b and c was determined {{using a combination}} of radial velocity and astrometric measurements. The planets were found to be almost <b>coplanar,</b> with an angle of only 5.0° between their orbital planes.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecliptic}} is {{the circular}} path on the celestial sphere that the Sun appears to follow {{over the course}} of a year; it is the basis of the ecliptic coordinate system. The term also refers to the plane of this path, which is <b>coplanar</b> with Earth's orbit around the Sun (and hence the Sun's apparent orbit around Earth).|$|E
5|$|The radial {{velocity}} method {{used to detect}} 55Cancrie obtains the minimum mass of 7.8 times that of Earth, or 48% {{of the mass of}} Neptune. The transit shows that its inclination is about 83.4 ± 1.7, so the real mass is close to the minimum. 55 Cancri e is also <b>coplanar</b> with b.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 876 has {{a notable}} orbital arrangement. It {{is the first}} {{planetary}} system around a normal star to have mutual inclination between planets measured without transits (previously the mutual inclination of the planets orbiting the pulsar PSR B1257+12 had been determined by measuring their gravitational interactions). Later measurements reduced {{the value of the}} mutual inclination, and in the latest four-planet models the incorporation mutual inclinations does not result in significant improvements relative to <b>coplanar</b> solutions.|$|E
5|$|The {{first three}} lunar {{missions}} (Apollo 8, Apollo 10, and Apollo 11) used a free return trajectory, keeping a flight path <b>coplanar</b> with the lunar orbit, {{which would allow}} a return to Earth in case the SM engine failed to make lunar orbit insertion. Landing site lighting conditions on later missions dictated a lunar orbital plane change, which required a course change maneuver soon after TLI, and eliminated the free-return option.|$|E
5|$|The {{peptide bond}} has two {{resonance}} forms that contribute some double-bond character and inhibit rotation around its axis, {{so that the}} alpha carbons are roughly <b>coplanar.</b> The other two dihedral angles in the peptide bond determine the local shape assumed by the protein backbone. The end with a free amino group {{is known as the}} N-terminus or amino terminus, whereas the end of the protein with a free carboxyl group is known as the C-terminus or carboxy terminus (the sequence of the protein is written from N-terminus to C-terminus, from left to right).|$|E
5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to discover 55 Cancri d is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. In the case of 55 Cancri d, this lower limit was around 3.835 times the mass of Jupiter. In 2004, astrometric measurements with the Fine Guidance Sensors on the Hubble Space Telescope suggest that the planet's orbit is inclined by around 53° {{with respect to the}} plane of the sky. If this measurement is confirmed, it implies that the planet's true mass is 25% greater than the lower limit, at around 4.8 Jupiter masses; and it will not be <b>coplanar</b> with the innermost planets e and b (both 85°).|$|E
5|$|All known planets transit the star; {{this means}} that all six planets' orbits appear to cross {{in front of their}} star as viewed from the Earth's perspective. Their inclinations {{relative}} to Earth's line of sight, or how far above or below the plane of sight they are, vary by {{a little more than a}} degree. This allows direct measurements of the planets' periods and relative diameters (compared to the host star) by monitoring each planet's transit of the star. Simulations suggest that the mean mutual inclinations of the planetary orbits are about 1°, meaning the system is probably more <b>coplanar</b> (flatter) than the Solar System, where the corresponding figure is 2.3°.|$|E
5|$|The mass of Gliese 876 d from radial {{velocity}} has one problem, {{it is that}} only a lower limit on the mass can be obtained. This is because the measured mass value also depends on the orbital inclination, which in general is unknown. However, models incorporating the gravitational interactions between the resonant outer planets enables the inclination of the orbits to be determined. This reveals that the outer planets are nearly <b>coplanar</b> with an inclination of around 59° {{with respect to the}} plane of the sky. Assuming that Gliese 876 d orbits in the same plane as the other planets, the true mass of the planet is revealed to be 6.83 times the mass of Earth.|$|E
5|$|Astrometric {{observations}} {{with the}} Hubble Space Telescope measured an inclination of 53° {{of the outer}} planet d, though this result relies on the precise orbital parameters which have been substantially revised since this was published. The observed transits of e suggest an orbit normal inclined within 9° to the line-of-light, and a possible detection of the transit of an extended atmosphere around 55 Cancri b would, if confirmed, imply that it too is in an orbit that is close to edge-on. Between them, no measurement of c's nor f's inclination has been made. It had been thought that with five planets, the system cannot deviate far from <b>coplanar</b> {{in order to maintain}} stability. An attempt to measure the spin-orbit misalignment of the innermost planet reported that it was in a nearly polar orbit, but this interpretation of the data has since been challenged by a subsequent study, with noted inconsistencies between the implied and measured stellar rotation.|$|E
5|$|Because Earth's {{rotational}} axis is not perpendicular to its orbital plane, Earth's equatorial plane is not <b>coplanar</b> with the ecliptic plane, but {{is inclined to}} it by an angle of about 23.4°, which {{is known as the}} obliquity of the ecliptic. If the equator is projected outward to the celestial sphere, forming the celestial equator, it crosses the ecliptic at two points known as the equinoxes. The Sun, in its apparent motion along the ecliptic, crosses the celestial equator at these points, one from south to north, the other from north to south. The crossing from south to north is known as the vernal equinox, also known as the first point of Aries and the ascending node of the ecliptic on the celestial equator. The crossing from north to south is the autumnal equinox or descending node.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of Gliese 581c and its mass have been {{measured by the}} radial velocity method of detecting extrasolar planets. The mass of a planet is calculated by the small periodic movements around a common centre of mass between the host star Gliese 581 and its planets. When all six planets are fitted with a Keplerian solution, the minimum mass of the planet is determined to be 5.5 Earth masses. The radial velocity method cannot by itself determine the true mass, but it cannot be very much larger than this or the system would be dynamically unstable. Dynamical simulations of the Gliese 581 system which assume the orbits of the planets are <b>coplanar</b> indicate that the planets cannot exceed approximately 1.6 to 2 times their minimum masses or the planetary system would be unstable (this is primarily due to the interaction between planets e and b). For Gliese 581c, the upper bound is 10.4 Earth masses.|$|E
5|$|The nebular {{hypothesis}} {{is the most}} widely accepted model {{in the field of}} cosmogony to explain the formation and evolution of the Solar System (as well as other planetary systems). It suggests that the Solar System formed from nebulous material. The theory was developed by Immanuel Kant and published in his Allgemeine Naturgeschichte und Theorie des Himmels ("Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens"), published in 1755. Originally applied to the Solar System, the process of planetary system formation is now thought to be at work throughout the Universe. The widely accepted modern variant of the nebular {{hypothesis is}} the solar nebular disk model (SNDM) or solar nebular model. It offered explanations for a variety of properties of the Solar System, including the nearly circular and <b>coplanar</b> orbits of the planets, and their motion {{in the same direction as}} the Sun's rotation. Some elements of the nebular hypothesis are echoed in modern theories of planetary formation, but most elements have been superseded.|$|E
5|$|Uranus is {{the seventh}} {{planet of the}} Solar System; it has 27 known moons, {{all of which are}} named after {{characters}} from the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. Uranus's moons are divided into three groups: thirteen inner moons, five major moons, and nine irregular moons. The inner moons are small dark bodies that share common properties and origins with Uranus's rings. The five major moons are massive enough to have reached hydrostatic equilibrium, and four of them show signs of internally driven processes such as canyon formation and volcanism on their surfaces. The largest of these five, Titania, is 1,578km in diameter and the eighth-largest moon in the Solar System, and about one-twentieth the mass of the Moon. The orbits of the regular moons are nearly <b>coplanar</b> with Uranus's equator, which is tilted 97.77° to its orbit. Uranus's irregular moons have elliptical and strongly inclined (mostly retrograde) orbits at large distances from the planet.|$|E

25|$|Varignon's theorem {{states that}} the {{midpoints}} of any quadrilateral in ℝ3 form a parallelogram, and so, are <b>coplanar.</b>|$|E
25|$|Squares: The cube is {{the only}} convex example. Other {{examples}} (the polycubes) {{can be obtained by}} joining cubes together, although care must be taken if <b>coplanar</b> faces are to be avoided.|$|E
25|$|For simple procedures, such as {{computing}} the delta-v for <b>coplanar</b> transfer ellipses, traditional {{approaches are}} fairly effective. Others, such as time-of-flight {{are far more}} complicated, especially for near-circular and hyperbolic orbits.|$|E
25|$|Two {{distinct}} points always {{determine a}} (straight) line. Three distinct points are either collinear or determine a unique plane. Four distinct points {{can either be}} collinear, <b>coplanar</b> or determine the entire space.|$|E
25|$|Toxic effects vary {{depending}} on the specific PCB. In terms of their structure and toxicity, PCBs fall into 2 distinct categories, referred to as <b>coplanar</b> or non-ortho-substituted arene substitution patterns and noncoplanar or ortho-substituted congeners.|$|E
25|$|It is {{the only}} model that {{explains}} the twinning of planets (and moons), but also explains <b>coplanar</b> and circular orbits, angular momentum distribution, the asteroid belts, the small size and orbital anomalies of Mars and Mercury, and the late heavy bombardments.|$|E
25|$|A {{dielectric}} waveguide employs a solid dielectric rod {{rather than a}} hollow pipe. An optical fibre is a dielectric guide designed to work at optical frequencies. Transmission lines such as microstrip, <b>coplanar</b> waveguide, stripline or coaxial cable may also {{be considered to be}} waveguides.|$|E
25|$|In geometry, a torus (plural tori) is {{a surface}} of {{revolution}} generated by revolving a circle in three-dimensional space about an axis <b>coplanar</b> with the circle. If the axis of revolution does not touch the circle, the surface has a ring shape and is called a torus of revolution.|$|E
25|$|A {{rotation}} symmetry in dimension 2 or 3 {{must move}} a lattice {{point to a}} succession of other lattice points in the same plane, generating a regular polygon of <b>coplanar</b> lattice points.

25|$|A sphere {{is uniquely}} {{determined}} by four points {{that are not}} <b>coplanar.</b> More generally, a sphere is uniquely determined by four conditions such as passing through a point, being tangent to a plane, etc. This property {{is analogous to the}} property that three non-collinear points determine a unique circle in a plane.|$|E
25|$|This {{hydrocarbon}} {{has four}} hydrogen atoms bound {{to a pair}} of carbon atoms that are connected by a double bond. All six atoms that comprise ethylene are <b>coplanar.</b> The H-C-H angle is 117.4°, close to the 120° for ideal sp² hybridized carbon. The molecule is also relatively rigid: rotation about the C-C bond is a high energy process that requires breaking the π-bond.|$|E
25|$|If the {{triangle}}s are <b>coplanar,</b> {{this test}} is not entirely successful. One can add some extra planes, for instance, planes that are normal to triangle edges, {{to fix the problem}} entirely. In other cases, objects that meet at a flat face must necessarily also meet at an angle elsewhere, hence the overall collision detection will be able to find the collision.|$|E
25|$|Although uncoordinated bipyridine {{is often}} drawn with its {{nitrogen}} atoms in cis conformation, the lowest energy conformation both in solid state and in solution {{is in fact}} <b>coplanar,</b> with nitrogen atoms in trans position. Protonated bipyridine adopts a cis conformation. Upon binding to metal ions the related N,N-heterocyclic ligand phenanthroline does not incur an enthalpic and entropic penalty, and thus its complexes {{tend to be more}} stable.|$|E
25|$|The <b>coplanar</b> {{group members}} {{have a fairly}} rigid {{structure}}, with their two phenyl rings in the same plane. It renders their structure similar to polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans, and allows them to act like PCDDs, as an agonist of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in organisms. They are considered as contributors to overall dioxin toxicity, and the term dioxins and dioxin-like compounds is often used interchangeably when the environmental and toxic impact of these compounds is considered.|$|E
25|$|The third component, λ Tau C, is {{orbiting}} the inner pair over a 33.025 day period with an eccentricity of roughly 0.15. The orbital plane of this component is nearly <b>coplanar</b> with {{the orbit of}} Lambda Tauri AB, differing {{by no more than}} 7°. It has about half the mass of the Sun. The orbit of this star causes perturbation effects on the orbit of the AB pair, resulting in periodic changes in their orbital eccentricity and other orbital elements.|$|E
25|$|To {{establish}} duality only requires establishing theorems {{which are}} the dual versions of the axioms for the dimension in question. Thus, for 3-dimensional spaces, one needs to show that (1*) every point lies in 3 distinct planes, (2*) every two planes intersect in a unique line and a dual version of (3*) to the effect: if the intersection of plane P and Q is <b>coplanar</b> with the intersection of plane R and S, then so are the respective intersections of planes P and R, Q and S (assuming planes P and S are distinct from Q and R).|$|E
