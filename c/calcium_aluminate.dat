Key findings of the investigation include that the composition of the mineral layer was principally composed of oxides of aluminium and calcium, present as various <b>calcium</b> <b>aluminates</b> and that the morphology of the layer profoundly affected the rate of carbon transfer.

40|$|Metallurgical coke, {{the primary}} fuel of the {{ironmaking}} blast furnace contains approximately 8 - 12 % mineral matter and carbon. The formation {{and development of}} the mineral matter layer that formed between coke and liquid iron during carbon dissolution has been investigated. Coke particles (- 2 mm, + 0. 5 mm) were added to the top surface of an iron 2 mass% C melt at representative ironmaking temperatures of 1450 oC, 1500 oC and 1550 oC, for periods of time between 2 minutes and 120 minutes, before being quenched. The samples were then sectioned and the coke-iron interface examined in the SEM. The mineral matter layer that formed during the dissolution of carbon from coke into liquid iron has been found to form a solid layer of <b>calcium</b> <b>aluminates</b> at the coke-metal interface. The composition and morphology of these <b>calcium</b> <b>aluminates</b> was observed to change over time, changing from an open acicular structure to a dense structure. The change in the composition and morphology of these aluminates was also observed to have a significant role in determining the rate of the coke(carbon) dissolution. The changes observed in the rate can be directly attributed to the densification of the interfacial mineral layer impeding irons contact with the coke. In the ironmaking blast furnace this densification of a mineral matter layer will reduce the efficiency of the ironmaking process by prohibiting the dissolution of coke.

To avoid this, Portland-type cements include a small addition of calcium sulfate (typically 4-8%). Sulfate ions in solution lead to the formation of an insoluble layer of ettringite (3CaO·Al2O3·3CaSO4·32H2O) over the surface of the aluminate crystals, passivating them. The aluminate then reacts slowly to form the AFm phase 3CaO·Al2O3·CaSO4·12H2O. These hydrates contribute little to strength development.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Liquid iron in the {{ironmaking}} {{blast furnace}} picks {{up more than}} half of its carbon while percolating through the packed coke bed in the deadman and hearth of the blast furnace thus the conditions within the hearth have a direct impact on liquid drainage and hot metal quality. Consequently, the rate of carbon dissolution into liquid iron, and the factors contributing to the movement of liquids through the coke bed must be understood. Investigations using quenched coke dissolution techniques have demonstrated that a mineral layer was formed between the liquid iron and the coke matrix as coke dissolves into iron under conditions comparable to the lower zone of the blast furnace hearth. This layer was predominantly comprised of <b>calcium</b> <b>aluminates</b> and was observed to change both its composition and morphology with time and temperature. Based on these findings, and plant based observations of the Port Kembla blast furnaces, important phenomena such has hearth coke bed state (floating vs sitting) are able to be discussed in terms of a cleaning/fouling cycle contributed to by the formation of different <b>calcium</b> <b>aluminates</b> in the deadman, in turn influenced by the coke ash chemistry. Supporting arguments for each stage of the cycle are drawn from the fundamental research, plant based observation and detailed analysis of specific blast furnace events. Application of this knowledge to Port Kembla blast furnace operations has allowed identification of periods where there is elevated risk of compromised hearth conditions. Further work in this area is expected to identify techniques that will allow a floating deadman to be secured improving furnace stability, iron quality and reducing hearth wear...|$|R
