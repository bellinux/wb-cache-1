25|$|Gibraltar International Airport is {{consistently}} listed {{as one of}} the world's scariest for air passengers. It is exposed to strong <b>cross</b> <b>winds</b> around the rock and across the Bay of Algeciras, making landings in winter particularly uncomfortable. Its location is unusual not only because of its proximity to the city centre resulting in the airport terminal being within walking distance of much of Gibraltar but also because the runway intersects Winston Churchill Avenue, the main north-south street, requiring movable barricades to close when aircraft land or depart. New roads and a tunnel, which will end the need to stop road traffic when aircraft use the runway, were planned to coincide with the building of a new airport terminal building with an originally estimated completion date of 2009, although it has not been completed because of delays.|$|E
25|$|In the 1989 Tour de France, 1988 winner Pedro Delgado {{was the big}} favourite, with Fignon, Stephen Roche, and Erik Breukink listed {{together}} as top contenders. After Delgado inexplicably was nearly three minutes late {{for the start of}} the prologue time trial, the race was open to all contenders, and ended up a battle between Greg LeMond and Fignon. LeMond won a minute in the time trial in stage five, using aerobars which enabled a new and more aerodynamic riding position (also known as tri-bars as they had previously only been used in triathlons), a new type of teardrop-shaped aerodynamic helmet in the time trials and a rear disc wheel, Fignon used normal road handlebars and a bicycle with both front and rear disc wheels, which left him more affected by <b>cross</b> <b>winds.</b> LeMond led the general classification after that stage by 5 seconds. In the tenth stage, Fignon beat LeMond by 12 seconds, and became the new leader, 7 seconds ahead of LeMond. In the time trial of stage 15, LeMond again won time on Fignon, and took back the leading position. Fignon came back by dropping LeMond on Alpe d'Huez, taking back the lead, and after he won alone at Villard-de-Lans the next day, the margin was 50 seconds.|$|E
40|$|Natural draft dry {{cooling tower}} (NDDCT) is an {{effective}} cooling technology which can be utilized in most of geothermal and concentrated solar thermal (CST) power plants. The experimental studies of the full scale cooling tower, especially the small size NDDCTs, are still not extensive. To fill this gap, Queensland Geothermal Energy Centre of Excellence (QGECE) at The University of Queensland has built a 20 m high NDDCT.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{a comparison between}} two new methodologies to perform the <b>cross</b> <b>wind</b> risk analysis on railway lines, developed within the European project Aerodynam-ic in Open Air (AOA, WP 2). The study consists {{in the evaluation of}} the probability of rail ve-hicle overturning when it is running on a railway line under the action of <b>cross</b> <b>wind.</b> According to both the methodologies, the <b>cross</b> <b>wind</b> risk analysis is based on a meteo study and on the determination of Characteristic Wind Curves (CWC). The meteo study provides the probability of occurrence of wind gusts on a specific point of a railway line while the CWC computation allows to evaluate the gust wind speed that leads the vehicle to overcome the specific safety limits. The <b>cross</b> <b>wind</b> risk is defined as the combined probability of the wind gust velocity occurrence and of the overcoming of the safety limit adopted for the defini-tion of the CWC. The two methodologies mainly differ in the calculation of the CWC, since one adopts a deterministic approach while the other is based on a stochastic procedure.

40|$|We present {{new data}} from High Energy Density (HED) {{laboratory}} experiments designed {{to explore the}} interaction of a heavy hypersonic radiative jet with a <b>cross</b> <b>wind.</b> The jets are generated with the MAGPIE pulsed power machine where converging conical plasma flows are produced from a cylindrically symmetric array of inclined wires. Radiative hypersonic jets emerge from the convergence point. The <b>cross</b> <b>wind</b> is generated by ablation of a plastic foil via soft-X-rays from the plasma convergence region. Our experiments show that the jets are deflected {{by the action of}} the <b>cross</b> <b>wind</b> with the angle of deflection dependent on the proximity of the foil. Shocks within the jet beam are apparent in the data. Analysis of the data shows that the interaction of the jet and <b>cross</b> <b>wind</b> is collisional and therefore in the hydro-dynamic regime. MHD plasma code simulations of the experiments are able to recover the deflection behaviour seen in the experiments. We consider the astrophysical relevance of these experiments applying published models of jet deflection developed for AGN and YSOs. Fitting the observed jet deflections to quadratic trajectories predicted by these models allows us to recover a set of plasma parameters consistent with the data. We also present results of 3 -D numerical simulations of jet deflection using a new astrophysical Adaptive Mesh Refinement code. These simulations show highly structured shocks occurring within the beam similar to what was observed in the experiment...|$|R
