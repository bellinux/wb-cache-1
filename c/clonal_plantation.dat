So, we aim to investigate the behavior of uniformity along a rotation and its relationship with productivity in Eucalyptus <b>clonal</b> <b>plantation.</b> For this, a randomized block experiment was replicated in three experimental sites. A uniform treatment, with all seedlings planted at the same time was contrasted with a heterogeneous treatment, where a third of seedlings were randomly planted on days 0, 40 and 80.

In both treatments uniformity peaked at the time of canopy closure and was gradually reduced {{until the end of the}} rotation. However, since the beginning the heterogeneous treatment was less uniform than the uniform treatment for all sites, reaching an average difference of 119 % for the PV 50 at the end of rotation.

Results show that P application significantly increased tree growth, biomass production, N, P and K uptake, and decreased understorey biomass and litter dry weight. Application of 208 kg P ha- 1 was adequate for tree growth. The proportion of stem-wood was increased {{and the proportion of}} root biomass was decreased as the quantity of phosphorus applied increased. The application of P also increased the proportion of tree biomass:total biomass of tree, understorey and litter.

The P recovery by tree uptake was between 7. 6 and 25. 3 % and decreased as the quantity of P applied increased. It is suggested that harvest residue, as well as understorey and litter should be retained on the site after harvest so that the accumulated P in these components following P fertilisation can benefit tree growth in the next rotation.

Field testing of the Bt poplars showed that the plantations were able to effectively protect themselves against damage of their defoliators. To assess any possible risk of transgenic poplar to the ecosystem, {{it is necessary to}} measure the rate of gene flow through pollen and the fate of seeds from the transgenic poplar plantation. In this study, we used the Bt transgenic poplar plantation (Populus nigra), established in 1994, to investigate the probability of Bt seeds produced by the surrounding non-transgenic female trees, and the germination rate of the Bt seeds in the field. We found the pollen pool from the Bt transgenic poplar plantation and the surrounding plantations (22 Bt- and about 1000 non-transgenic male trees) was able to fertilize the female in <b>clonal</b> <b>plantation</b> of Populus pioner located within 1000 m in distance from Bt transgenic poplar plantation, and the Bt seeds were produced at the probability from 2 / 1000 at 0 m to less than 3 / 10000 at 500 m in distance from the Bt transgenic poplar plantation, respectively. The Bt seeds lost their capability to germinate in 2 weeks in the field, 3 weeks in the laboratory, but much less when they were stored at 4. No seedling survived in the field without any treatment, while about 1. 75 % of survival was found with treatments of irrigation and weed control. These results indicated that the transgene of Bt poplar plantation had rare chance to spread through pollen and seed if not impossible in the field in northern China.

40|$|This is {{the first}} report on the {{parasitoid}} Palmistichus elaeisis, genus Eulophidae, found in the field parasitizing pupae of defoliating eucalyptus. Lepidopterous pests occur in eucalyptus plantations in Brazil, reaching high population levels. Due {{to the complexity of}} pest control in eucalyptus forests, alternative control methods have been proposed, for instance biological control through use of parasitoids. Natural enemies {{play an important role in}} regulating host populations because their larvae feed on the eggs, larvae, pupae or adults of other insects. The parasitic Hymenoptera are important agents in biological control programs against forest pests, and may provide economic and environmental benefits. The generalist endoparasitoid Palmistichus elaeisis Delvare and LaSalle, 1993 (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) can develop in its host’s pupae, which overcome the host’s physiology and can therefore be used for biological control of agricultural and forest pests. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of P. elaeisis as a pupal parasitoid of S. violascens in providing a potential alternative to chemical control of the pest and creation of an alternative host. The experiment was developed in the Laboratory for Biological Control of Forest Pests, Universidade Estadual Paulista "Julio Mesquita Filho”. Parasitoids used in this test were originally collected on pupae of E. eucerus. (Lepidoptera: Riodinidae) in eucalyptus plantations at Lençois Paulistas, São Paulo state, Brazil, in 2011. Thereafter, a laboratory culture has been maintained, using pupae of Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) (Lep. : Noctuidae) as hosts. S. violascens eggs were collected in a eucalyptus <b>clonal</b> <b>plantation</b> in Sao Paulo state (Brazil). Larvae were reared under ambient conditions on Eucalyptus urophylla S. T. Blake (Myrtaceae) leaves. The following parameters were determined: parasitism level, numbers of emerged and non-emerged parasitoids and duration of egg-adult cycle. The S. violascens pupae were dissected to evaluate the non-emerged parasitoids. The parasitism level reached 100 %, with a 100 % emergence rate. It was verified that 113. 2 ± 0. 8 parasitoids emerged per individual pupa versus only 0. 7 ± 0. 1 that did not emerge. The P. elaeisis egg-adult cycle was 20. 3 ± 0. 6 days in S. violascens pupae.

40|$|We {{examined}} resource {{limitations on}} growth and carbon allocation in a fast-growing, <b>clonal</b> <b>plantation</b> of Eucalyptus grandis x urophylla in Brazil by characterizing responses to annual rainfall, {{and response to}} irrigation and fertililization for 2 years. Productivity measures included gross primary production (GPP), total belowground carbon allocation (TBCA), bole growth, and net ecosystem production (NEP). Replicate plots within a single plantation were established at {{the midpoint of the}} rotation (end of year 3), with treatments of no additional fertilization or irrigation, heavy fertilization (to remove any nutrient limitation), irrigation (to remove any water limitation), and irrigation plus fertilization. Rainfall was unusually high in the first year (1769 mm) of the experiment, and control plots had high rates of GPP (6. 64 kg C m(- 2) year(- 1)), TBCA (2. 14 kg C m(- 2) year(- 1)), and bole growth (1. 81 kg C m(- 2) year). Irrigation increased each of these rates by 15 - 17 %. The second year of the experiment had average rainfall (1210 mm), and lower rainfall decreased production in control plots by 46 % (GPP), 52 % (TBCA), and 40 % (bole growth). Fertilization treatments had neglible effects. The response to irrigation was much greater in the drier year, with irrigated plots exceeding the production in control plots by 83 % (GPP), 239 % (TBCA), and 24 % (bole growth). Even though the rate of irrigation ensured no water limitation to tree growth, the high rainfall year showed higher production in irrigated plots for both GPP (38 % greater than in drier year) and bole growth (23 % greater). Varying humidity and supplies of water led to a range in NEP of 0. 8 - 2. 7 kg C m(- 2) year. This difference between control and irrigated treatments, combined with differences between drier and wetter years, indicated a strong response of these Eucalyptus trees to both water supply and atmospheric humidity during the dry season. The efficiency of converting light energy into fixed carbon ranged from a low of 0. 027 mol C to a high of 0. 060 mol C per mol of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR), and the efficiency of bolewood production ranged from 0. 78 to 1. 98 g wood per MJ of APAR. Irrigation increased the efficiency of wood production per unit of water used from 2. 55 kg wood m(- 3) in the rainfed plot to 3. 51 kg m(- 3) in irrigated plots.

Nine selected genotypes (13 -year-old trees) of the commercial hybrid Juglans major 209 x J. regia were cultured in vitro on DKW-C medium supplemented with 4. 4 µM BA and 50 µM IBA. A protocol was developed that relies {{on the use of}} 0. 40 mM phloroglucinol during shoot multiplication, 0. 20 mM previous root induction, and 6. 81 mg/L Fe 3 + (FeEDDHA). Moreover, the addition of 83. 2 µM glucose during the root expression phase significantly improved plant survival during acclimatization. Phloroglucinol promoted microshoot elongation but inhibited rooting, especially at concentrations above 0. 40 mM.

40|$|A {{few decades}} ago rubber {{was one of the}} first tree crops to be {{characterized}} by a spectacular breakthrough, the production of new, highly productive clonal material. With regard to rubber, the adoption of clonal planting materials led to a spectacular improvement in labour-productivity and revenues. It requires also different cropping patterns during immature period. An increase in return to labour costs is usually the first priority of smallholders. As this adoption of clones by smallholders only started in the 1970 s in Indonesia, this is an extremely important strategy which must be stressed before we begin to analyze the impact of the krismon (a contraction of “Krisis Monetar” in Indonesian or “monetary crisis”). With regard to rubber, there is clearly a dualism of seedlings and clonal material. This dualism is more important than with other tree crops. Rubber seedlings are often grown under a complex agroforestry system and nicknamed locally ‘jungle rubber'. Clonal rubber is generally grown in monoculture sometimes with intercrops during the first three years. “Even when computing the cost of the investment and the credit that has to be repaid, the net income per hectare and per labour day from a <b>clonal</b> <b>plantation</b> is at least 50 % higher (sometimes 100 %) than the income from a jungle rubber plantation” (Gouyon 1999, 31). What was the situation before krismon? Due to capital and information constraints, only 15 % of the smallholders already had access to highly productive clonal material rubber in 1996. This percentage was achieved, first and foremost, through official projects. Then in the late 1990 s, the “copying effect” started playing its role, however rather limited. More and more farmers were able to observe the advantages of clonal material. This led to a booming network of private nurseries that helped to accelerate the adoption of this material. This means that a relatively strong dynamism was observed before krismon. It also means that most clonal plantations are still young, which is important in terms of potential response to price changes (Chapter 1). However, when krismon arrived, around 85 % of traditionnal rubber farmers still relied on ageing jungle rubber with limited productivity. How may krismon influence these ‘jungle rubber' and ‘clonal' farming systems? Is it going to accelerate or reduce the investment in rubber plantings? Is it going to help to accelerate the adoption of clones? In 1998, rubber farmers did not benefit from the spectacular windfall, which affected cocoa and coffee (Chapters 5 - 7). Can this be explained by the different performances of farming systems or by variations of the International market? Is there a direct relationship between the decline of global prices and the interference of the Asian crisis in Indonesian rubber supply and exports (Chapter 2) ? Page 2 How did the monetary crisis affect the other dramatic changes faced by Indonesian rubber smallholders? In addition to the economic crisis, as in other regions of the country, the ecological crisis also struck Sumatra and Kalimantan in 1997 - 98. Huge fires destroyed millions of hectares of forests, fallows and crops, including rubber. Will both crisis reduce investment in clonal plantings? Eventually, regions such as West-Kalimantan were the theatre for grave social troubles related to conflicts between autochtons and some immigrants, especially spontaneous immigrants 1. A lack of confidence in the country's regime was evident well before the crisis. Last but not least, oil palm development looms in traditional rubber regions. Might it hamper the development of clonal rubber technology in Indonesia? Does the crisis encourage the adoption of oil palm at the expense of rubber? Does the crisis deepen the social imbalance between smallholders who already have access to clones and those who do not? To try to answer these questions, the paper is structured in 4 sections: 1 A brief overview of the rubber sector : the situation before krismon 2 Krismon and its impact on rubber smallholdings 3 The rubber crisis on the international market 4 A conclusion including the future for the rubber smallholder secto...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} an {{investigation}} into variation in commercial oil traits of sets of Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) clones and improved seedling controls at up to three plant stockings (33, 333, 22, 222 and 16, 667 plants/ha). The two trials examined in this work were planted in 2004 and 2006 at Bungawalbin by the Rural Industry Research and Development Corporation (RIRDC) /Australian Tea Tree Industry Association (ATTIA) tea tree breeding programme managed by the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries (NSW DPI). The main aim of these trials {{was to determine if}} there is a financial advantage to growers in replanting their existing unimproved tea tree plantations with clones rather than using improved seedlings from seed orchards established by the breeding programme. This is addressed by the development of a financial model comparing the financial aspects of planting clones vs. seedlings at two stockings (33, 333 and 16, 667 plants/ha) The 2006 clonal spacing trial (CST) was assessed prior to the first harvest when trees were 12 months old. In the 2004 CST they were assessed prior to the third harvest when coppice shoots were 18 months. All surviving trees were assessed for growth traits while a sampling scheme was used to estimate dry weights of key tree components associated with off-paddock oil yield and oil characteristics of the clones and seedlings in the trials. Determinations of dry weights of key tree components, extraction of leaf oil using solvent techniques, and gas chromatographic analysis to determine quantity and quality of oils were undertaken at the Essential Oil Unit of NSW DPI. This study showed that plant stocking can {{have a significant effect on}} the growth and oil traits of tea tree. Trees at lower stocking (wider spacing) typically have a higher leafiness score as they are given more space and there is less competition for light. But they also had lower oil concentrations than those at higher stockings (narrow spacing). Dry weights of key tree components and oil yields of tea tree plantations on a per hectare basis were found to be greatest at the highest stocking of 33, 333 plants/ha, which is typical of the stocking used in most commercial plantations of M. alternifolia for oil production. Clones in the 2006 CST showed superiority in commercial oil traits over seedlings grown from improved seed from the breeding programme. Oil concentration of clones in this trial averaged 91. 6 mg/g ODW and 86. 69 mg/g ODW compared to seedlings that averaged 63. 6 mg/g ODW and 55. 77 mg/g ODW from the stocking of 33, 333 plants/ha and 16, 667 plants/ha respectively. Conversely, the three clones under trial in the 2004 CST were inferior in commercial oil traits to the improved seedling controls (averaged 75. 68 mg/g ODW and 75. 59 mg/g ODW cf. 81. 32 mg/g ODW and 76. 47 mg/g ODW), due to extraneous factors, particularly the fact that Jrooted clones had poorer growth. Consistency in 1, 8 -cineole content was a feature of each clone compared to greater variability amongst seedling stock. This is an advantage for marketing as the current market requires the oils’ 1, 8 -cineole content to be 3 % or lower due to the misconception that this constituent is an irritant to skin and mucous membranes. The variation in growth and oil traits of clones in the 2006 CST indicates that further gains in oil yields and oil quality can be achieved by deploying only the very best clones. The trial data suggested that average oil yields of 522. 6 kg/ha and 356 kg/ha might be obtained from plantations established using three best clones –clone 5 (C 64), clone 6 (C 66) and clone 9 (C 70) – at stockings of 33, 333 plants/ha and 16, 667 plants/ha respectively. These yields are substantially greater than the mature oil yields recorded for CSO 1 (ATTIA 2 B) seedlings in breeding programme yield trials (357 kg/ha at a stocking of 30, 000 plants/ha). A further advantage of clones over seedlings is that clones give mature oil yields from first harvest whilst it is not until year three that seedlings give a higher, mature oil yield. Financial analyses to evaluate the viability of replanting 20 -ha tea tree plantations using elite clones and improved seedlings over a 15 -year time frame were carried out. Four plantation options were modelled i. e. (1) plantations established using ATTIA 2 B seedlings planted at a stocking of 33, 333 plants/ha and (2) 16, 667 plants/ha, (3) plantations established using the three best selected clones planted at a stocking of 33, 333 plants/ha and (4) 16, 667 plants/ha. Capital costs e. g. purchase of land and machinery were not included in this analysis, as all plantation options involve replacement plantations. The financial analysis showed that, at the current oil price of $ 45 /kg, replacement plantations of either elite clones or improved seedlings are both highly profitable irrespective of the stocking employed. The NPV of the plantation per hectare at 7 % discount rate was $ 109, 584, $ 65, 224, $ 164, 921 and $ 105, 638 for plantation options 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. A <b>clonal</b> <b>plantation</b> at a stocking of 33, 333 plants/ha was predicted to give the greatest profit at any of the oil prices tested, followed by plantations using improved seedlings at a stocking of 33, 333 plants/ha, plantations using clones at a stocking of 16, 667 plants/ha, and plantations using seedlings at a stocking of 16, 667 plants/ha. The break-even prices for tea tree oil production, using the production parameters in this model were $ 11. 3 /kg, $ 15. 5 /kg, $ 10. 4 /kg and $ 12. 5 /kg for plantation options 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively...|$|E

40|$|Eucalyptus grandis {{and other}} <b>clonal</b> <b>plantations</b> cover about 3. 5 million ha in Brazil. The impacts of intensively-managed short-rotation {{forestry}} on soil aggregate structure and Carbon (C) dynamics are largely undocumented in tropical ecosystems. Long-term sustainability {{of these systems}} is probably in part linked to maintenance of soil organic matter and good soil structure and aggregation, especially in areas with low-fertility soils. This study investigated soil aggregate dynamics on a clay soil and a sandy soil, each with a Eucalyptus plantation and an adjacent primary forest. Silvicultural management did not reduce total C stocks, and did not change soil bulk density. Aggregates of the managed soils did not decrease in mass as hypothesized, which indicates that soil cultivation in 6 year cycles did not cause large decreases in soil aggregation in either soil texture. Silt, clay, and C of the sandy plantation soil shifted to greater aggregate protection, which may represent a decrease in C availability. The organic matter in the clay plantation soil increased in the fractions considered less protected while this shift from C to structural forms considered more protected was not observed...|$|R
40|$|Clonal {{forestry}} {{offers the}} opportunity to increase yields, enhance uniformity and improve wood characteristics. Intensive silvicultural practices, including fertilization, {{will be required to}} capture the full growth potential of <b>clonal</b> <b>plantations.</b> However, variation in nutrient use efficiency that exists among clones could affect growth responses. Our research objective was to determine the range of growth response and stem form quality due to fertilization in clones of Pinus taeda. A split-plot experimental design was used, with the whole plots being two levels of fertilizer application (fertilizer versus control) and the split plot factor being 25 clones. Whole plot treatments were blocked and replicated four times. Six years after planting and five years after fertilizer application, a repeated measures analysis showed fertilizer by-time and clone-by-time interactions affected volume (p 3 ̆c 0. 10). Clone-by-fertilizer interactions were observed for tree height, branch traits, and a metric of foliar display. These interactions were primarily due to scale-effect phenomena rather than rank shifts. The magnitude of fertilizer responses observed in a small number of genotypes suggests that knowledge of fertilizer responses in widely deployed genotypes, if developed prior to mid-rotation, may better optimize management of single-clone blocks. Our results further indicate that a range of possibilities exist for the design and application of clone-specific precision silvicultural systems...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The Brazilian {{industry}} commonly dries {{different species}} of eucalypt in a same load {{because of the difficulty}} of identifying the species, hybrids and clones, and also by optimizing the use of the kiln. However, this practice is not recommended in the literature. The aim of this work was to verify the quality of grouped conventional drying of Eucalyptus saligna, Eucalyptus grandis and Eucalyptus dunnii from <b>clonal</b> <b>plantations.</b> To this end, three loads were dried with the three species together in a pilot conventional dry kiln. The criteria used to analyze the quality of dried wood were final moisture content, end checks, cupping, collapse, moisture gradient and drying stresses. Eucalyptus grandis showed the best quality of drying, followed by Eucalyptus saligna, and both species have potential to be kiln dried together. Eucalyptus dunnii had the worst quality of drying, and should not be kiln dried together with Eucalyptus grandis and Eucalyptus saligna. The basic density and shrinkage were good parameters for the expected quality of the drying of eucalyptus species, in which less dense and more dimensionally stable species had better quality of drying. The drying schedule used must be modified to further drying of these species, especially regarding to uniformity and conditioning periods, which were considered insufficient...|$|R
40|$|Competition {{control is}} {{essential}} for successful eucalyptus plantation establishment, yet few selective herbicides have been identified. Five herbicides, flumioxazin, imazamox, imazapic, oxyfluorfen, and sulfometuron methyl, were evaluated for selective weed control {{in the establishment of}} genetically modified frost tolerant Eucalyptus urograndis clones. Herbicides were applied at two or three rates, either before or after weed emergence, and compared to a nontreated control and to near-complete weed control obtained with glyphosate directed sprays. Applications prior to weed emergence were most effective for weed control and, with the exception of imazapic, all resulted in enhanced eucalyptus growth relative to the nontreated control. Among postemergent treatments, only imazamox enhanced stem volume. Among selective herbicide treatments, preemergent 2240 [*]g[*]ha− 1 oxyfluorfen produced the best growth response, resulting in stem volume index that was 860 % greater than the nontreated control, although only 15 % of the volume index obtained with near-complete weed control. Imazapic was the most phytotoxic of all herbicides, resulting in 40 % mortality when applied preemergent. Survival was 100 % for all other herbicide treatments. This research found the previously nontested herbicides imazamox and imazapic to be effective for selective weed control and refined application rate and timing of five herbicides for use in <b>clonal</b> <b>plantations...</b>|$|R
40|$|Differences {{in water}} use {{efficiency}} (WUE) have been extensively investigated in trees using carbon- 13 in leaf biomass as a surrogate. We now have evidence of considerable diversity for this trait in several tree species, and valuable {{insight into the}} genetic control of this diversity is available. Nevertheless, two main questions remain open: 1) Is the observed diversity of WUE in natural populations neutral, or is WUE subject to selective pressure? 2) Is enhanced WUE a valuable target for breeding in plantation species such as poplar or pines? Based on recent evidence obtained in natural populations of oaks and beech, {{as well as in}} <b>clonal</b> <b>plantations</b> of poplar, we discuss these two questions and provide some answers, as well as outline further research needs. Briefly, there is currently little evidence from natural populations that the observed genetic diversity in 13 C discrimination and WUE is organized along clear patterns related for instance to soil water availability. We therefore urgently need more data on the genetic variability in 13 C discrimination at local scales, i. e., common garden experiments. Breeding for enhanced WUE will not produce genotypes with enhanced drought resistance, but could possibly increase the sustainability of plantation forestry in regions where water availability is a major issue...|$|R

Six different ages were selected along the crop cycle (2 nd to 7 th year). Afterthe forest inventory was carried out, the biomass of three trees fractionated into wood, bark, branches andleaves was collected. The biomass of roots on the average tree of each plot was measured to a depth of 1 m. Physical and chemical analyses were performed in soil samples from the layers: 0 to 20 cm, 20 to 40 cmand 40 to 100 cm. Litter deposition was estimated by allocating 4 square collectors of 0. 5 m². The leaf areawas obtained through digital photographs and thus the specific leaf area was estimated. The physiologicalparameters were measured in six plots, one at each age. Climatic parameters were provided by EEA ofUFRGS University, located in Eldorado do Sul, RS state.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{selection}} of yerba mate superior genotypes, based on each plant leaf weight, {{is based on}} genetic parameters obtained from experimental plantations and it is practically impossible from the fourth year of age. Therefore, we estimate genetic parameters and check the feasibility of selection through notes and weight estimates of each tree at 18. 5 years of age. The genetic material consists of a combined trial of provenances and progenies of half-sibs with 140 progenies from 7 provenances, installed in Ivaí, Paraná, Brazil, in a randomized block design with 10 repetitions. The genetic control of leaf production is of low magnitude (ĥ 2 a= 0. 175042 ± 0. 0393) revealing high influence of the environment. The additive genetic correlations between the real weight of leaves × notes and real weight of leaves × visually estimated weight were of high magnitude (higher than 88 %). Thus, the selection based on the leaves weight {{can be carried out}} without major losses in genetic gains by both methodologies when the purpose is the sexual selection, in which case the sort order has no importance. In the case of vegetative propagation, aiming <b>clonal</b> <b>plantations,</b> in which only the plants with the highest genotypic values should be selected, the selection by means of notes and leaves weight estimates proved to be inefficient...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} 4 decades {{there has been}} {{considerable}} expansion in the plantation forestry along the eastern seaboard of South Africa. In particular there have been significant increases in eucalypt, and to a less extent, pine plantations on soils of a light sandy texture along the Zululand coastal plain. These soils are characteristically dominated by sands with low clay and organic matter contents, have low cation exchange capacity and water holding capacity. Pedogenesis and selected chemical attributes of a 49 -year-old stand of Eucalyptus grandis and Pinus elliottii established on these sands were compared. Changes in soil pH, exchangeable cations, organic carbon, extractable Fe and Al and the surface charge characteristics were investigated. Evidence {{of the development of}} bleached A 2 e horizon within the surface 0 - 5 cm depth interval under E. grandis was confirmed through the development of surface charge fingerprints, changes in organic carbon and Fe and Al mobilization for each of the pedogenetically distinct horizons. Such development was not observed under the P. elliottii stand, suggesting that this pine species has had less impact on the soil. It is argued that the rate of A 2 e horizon development is not dissimilar to that observed under native forest ecosystems in Australia, although considerably slower that those observed under reclaimed sand mining operations. Whilst these systems appear to be relatively stable due to no clear felling and timber product extraction, this could drastically change with the introduction of short-term rotations of fast growing <b>clonal</b> <b>plantations,</b> questioning the long-term sustainability of these production systems on these light textured sands...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Initial {{high density}} (17, 200 trees ha- 1, 6961 trees a- 1) {{plantations}} of Eucalyptus grandis yielded up to 22 oven dry tons (ODT) ha-l yr-I (10 ta- 1 yr- 1) on an approximate 6 month rotation. Border effects {{could not be}} eliminated from the small sized plots used. Also within 4 years of planting there were substantial differences in tree vigor and survival such that the effective density was reduced by half. Subsequent plantations of several hardwood species at 5000 trees a- 1 and with somewhat better border protection were harvested 2 years after planting; tree survival was greater and in some E. camaldulensis plantings yields were in excess of 37 ODT h-a 1 yr- 1 (16. 5 ta- 1 yr- 1). Accounting for border pct. E. camaldulensis and E. cam x rudis outyielded Salix, Acacia, Populus and Ailanthus sp. tested. Current trials are with greater border thickness and compare seedling and <b>clonal</b> <b>plantations</b> of some fast growing eucalyptus selections at planting densities from about 1900 trees a- 1 down to 600 trees a- 1. From the outset the major goal of our research has been to determine the feasibility of growing fuelwood as an alternate crop on underutilized but otherwise high valued farmlands (say $ 1500 a- 1).

40|$|The {{forest tree}} species Hevea brasiliensis is {{extensively}} {{planted in the}} humid tropics to meet the increasing demand for natural rubber. Huge quantities of planting stock are therefore needed. The seed option remains the easiest and cheapest way to establish plantations of rubber trees but those show a great variability for vigor and also for latex yield. The rationale of producing clones for overcoming this variability was already obvious in the early 1910 's but due to the difficulties encountered at that time for rooting shoots, grafting {{was used as an}} alternative cloning method. The striking increase in yield noticed from the graft-derived <b>clonal</b> <b>plantations</b> warranted their large scale development. Eventually, the budded clones by virtue of their much higher and uniform productivity supplanted the seedlings in most industrial plantations. However, grafting is also associated with drawbacks and for decades efforts aiming at mass producing selected rubber tree clones on their own roots by rooted cuttings have been pursued. However, this approach was progressively abandoned due to disappointing rooting results and, from the 70 's onwards, priority has been given to in vitro methods which were booming during this period. But despite 40 years of heavy investments, industrial H. brasiliensis clones could still not be mass micropropagated in vitro efficiently enough to meet the requirements of large scale production. The situation may change radically soon, however, due to the development of new nursery techniques adapted to the mass clonal production by rooted cuttings of any H. brasiliensis selected genotype. Efforts to improve the techniques as well as the establishment of new field trials are underway in order to determine if self-rooted rubber tree clones are more productive than grafted ones. This old issue is becoming of overriding importance considering the increasing pressure on land availability reducing thereby the prospects for expanding rubber tree plantations.

40|$|Keywords: Kenya, Camellia sinensis L., clones, seedlings, tea {{industry}}, management, N-P-K, biomass, made tea yields. The tea {{industry in}} Kenya is rural-based and provides livelihood to over {{three million people}} along the value chain. The industry which started {{in the first quarter}} of the 20 th century has continued to increase in terms of production and total acreage. Tea is grown in prime agricultural and forest land and can be in production for up to 100 years if well managed. However, peak yields are obtained at 20 – 40 years after planting followed by a decline to a level where the plantations may become degraded and uneconomical. In the past, several hypotheses have been postulated, but the cause of this degradation largely remains unclear. The big question still lingers, is it the tea bush that degrades, the soil or both? In this study, trends in tea yields were first assessed by analysing long-term tea production data, from 1969 to 2006, for the two sectors of the Kenyan tea industry. The plantations are characterized by differences in age and genotypes (seedling or clonal). To explore plausible management options for tea productivity improvement, a simple decision-support (DS) model for Managing Ageing Plantations of Tea (MAP-Tea) was developed and scenario analyses were done to explore some promising management interventions. It was found that uprooting and replanting of degraded old seedling tea <b>plantations</b> with <b>clonal</b> cultivars would be profitable. However, management practices that prevent degradation are most cost effective. The experimental part of the study was carried out during two years, 2002 / 2003 and 2003 / 2004, in a chronosequence of existing tea plantations (14, 29, 43 and 76 years old), adjacent to a natural forest in Kericho, Kenya. Soil-plant-environment relations and effects on tea bush productivity, C and N-P-K stocks and soil quality traits were analysed. Younger <b>clonal</b> tea <b>plantations</b> established at high densities outyielded the older seedling plantations with a lower densities. Ageing per se did not reduce the N-response or the productivity of tea plantations. It was shown that seedling tea bushes acquire much higher C and N-P-K nutrient stocks with age than clonal bushes. This may enable seedling plantations to depend less on limiting nutrient(s) supply under adverse conditions, i. e. drought. The top soils of the four tea plantations showed small differences in chemical and biological characteristics, also in comparison to the natural forest. Soil pH and total organic carbon were weakly related to the productivity of the ageing tea plantations. Additions of tea prunings in incubated soils caused immobilization of N and lowered the net N-mineralization compared to the forest soil, but the differences were relatively small and unlikely to cause degradation of the ageing tea plantations. Further improvement in productivity and resource use of ageing tea plantations should come from a better timing and dosing of nitrogen, and from the transition from old low-yielding seedling plantations to modern higher-yielding <b>clonal</b> <b>plantations</b> taking into account Genotype × Environment × Management (G×E×M) relationships...|$|R
