25|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was greatly}} improved from the Class NG G11, with trailing wheels added to each engine unit, outside bar frames instead of plate frames, round-topped fireboxes instead of Belpaire fireboxes, and larger dimensions in most respects except the grate area. They were superheated and sported an extremely compact arrangement of Walschaerts valve gear and outside bar frames. The leading wheels were arranged as conventional pony trucks, while the inner <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> were built to the Gölsdorf system which allowed the axle some lateral movement.|$|E
25|$|Locomotives {{with total}} adhesion, {{where all of}} the wheels are coupled together, {{generally}} lack stability at speed. To counter this, locomotives often fit unpowered <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> mounted on two-wheeled trucks or four-wheeled bogies centred by springs that help to guide the locomotive through curves. These usually take on weight – of the cylinders at the front or the firebox at the rear — when the width exceeds that of the mainframes. For multiple coupled-wheels on a rigid chassis, a variety of systems for controlled side-play exist.|$|E
25|$|Shortly before {{ordering}} the XF11C-1, the Navy {{had bought a}} company-owned Model 64A demonstrator. This had a Wright R-1820-78 Cyclone engine, slightly longer main landing-gear legs <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> with low-pressure tires, a tailwheel {{in place of the}} tailskid, fabric-covered control surfaces on the tail, and external provision for underwing racks for light bombs as well as an under-fuselage hardpoint for either a 50gal (189l) fuel tank or the crutch that would swing a bomb clear of the propeller disc before release in a dive-bombing attack.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>carrying</b> <b>wheel</b> on a steam {{locomotive}} is a wheel {{that is not}} driven, i.e. it is uncoupled and can run freely, unlike a coupled or driving wheel. It is also described as a running wheel and their axle may be called a carrying axle. A <b>carrying</b> <b>wheel</b> {{is referred to as}} leading wheel if it is at the front, or a trailing wheel if it is {{at the rear of the}} locomotive.|$|R

25|$|Some rectifiable {{shortcomings}} were cylinders with old-fashioned short-travel valves with Z-ported cylinders, plain bearings on {{the inner}} <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> that were inclined to run hot and a cab that was too small and unbearably hot in summer. The heat was made worse by the steam turret, vacuum-brake ejector and sight-feed lubricator that were placed inside the cab. Since the seats of the driver and stoker were mounted on poles which allowed them to be swung around to outside the cab, crews could often be seen riding outside to escape the heat.|$|E
500|$|With no working prototypes, Green {{set about}} {{building}} seven lifts. The principle was simple. Two caissons were suspended from three <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> of [...] diameter, by wrought iron chains. The caisson {{at the bottom}} was jacked against the front wall of the lift to seal it, and a door or gate was opened to allow the boat to float in. The caisson at the top was jacked {{against the back wall}} in a similar manner. When both boats were in, the doors on the caissons and lift were closed, and the jacks released. Because a boat displaces its own weight in water, the system should be balanced, and a small amount of energy is required to start the boats moving. When the top caisson reaches the bottom, the jacks are applied, the doors are opened, and the boats can continue.|$|E
50|$|The du Bousquet design had {{an unusual}} wheel arrangement; both trucks had six driving wheels and two <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> {{supporting}} the cylinders. Unlike many other articulated designs, these <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> were {{toward the center}} of the locomotive, as were the cylinders. This arrangement is expressed in the French classification as 031+130, in the Whyte notation as 0-6-2+2-6-0T, or in the UIC classification as (C1')(1'C)t.|$|E

25|$|In 1659, the Italian Tito Livio Burattini built {{a machine}} with nine {{independent}} wheels, {{each one of}} these wheels was paired with a smaller <b>carry</b> <b>wheel.</b> At the end of an operation the user had to either manually add each carry to the next digit or mentally add these numbers to create the final result.|$|R
50|$|Roll-on/roll-off (RORO or ro-ro) {{ships are}} vessels {{designed}} to <b>carry</b> <b>wheeled</b> cargo, such as cars, trucks, semi-trailer trucks, trailers, and railroad cars, that are driven {{on and off}} the ship on their own wheels or using a platform vehicle, such as a self-propelled modular transporter. This is in contrast to lift-on/lift-off (LoLo) vessels, which use a crane to load and unload cargo.|$|R
50|$|The driving axles {{were fixed}} in the frame, the leading <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> were {{designed}} as a Novotny-Klien axle.|$|E
50|$|Their rigidly mounted leading and {{trailing}} <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> {{were also}} arranged as radial axles {{to allow for}} sideways motion of the wheels {{in relation to the}} locomotive frame, since the locomotive did not have separate bogie trucks. As on the Class Hd, this resulted in a rigid wheelbase of 17 ft, even though the leading <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> were arranged to the rear instead of ahead of the cylinders.|$|E

France will provide engineers to supervise the construction of technically demanding works such as bridges and tunnels.|$|R
50|$|The {{tricycle}} undercarriage, unusual at the time, had short main legs {{made possible}} by the combination of lower fuselage depth and hence lower wing position, together with the offset propeller. These legs were joined to the front wing spar close to the fuselage, cross braced and splayed outwards to increase the track. The front leg, mounted just behind the engine, was much longer; all three legs were faired and <b>carried</b> <b>wheels</b> enclosed in spats.|$|R

2500|$|In 1666, Samuel Morland {{invented a}} machine {{designed}} to add sums of money, {{but it was}} not a true adding machine since the carry was added to a small <b>carry</b> <b>wheel</b> situated above each digit and not directly to the next digit. It was very similar to Burattini's machine. Morland created also a multiplying machines with interchangeable disks based on Napier's bones. [...] Taken together these two machines provided a capacity similar to that of the invention of Schickard, although it is doubtful that Morland ever encountered Schickard's calculating clock.|$|R

50|$|The first thirty had 3 ft <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels,</b> {{the latter}} twenty had 3 ft <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels.</b> The LNWR reused numbers from {{withdrawn}} locomotives, so the numbering system was completely haphazard. The 3 ft 9 in engines were numbered by 528, 531, 784, 1295, 1305, 1981-1985, 97, 111, 181, 196, 562, 616, 803, 1356, 1508, 2210, 139, 653, 834, 874, 1506, 1572, 1589, 1671, 1714, and 2165. The 3 ft 3 in engines were numbered 44, 527, 612, 762, 827, 875, 1427, 1764, 2196, 2446, 920, 935, 1164, 1219, 1523, 1536, 1551, 2077, 2223 and 2228.|$|E
50|$|The {{coupled axles}} were sprung {{underneath}} with leaf springs. Weight balancing was achieved using an equalising beam between the springs. The front <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> had leaf springs above the axles.|$|E
50|$|In 1937, Société Anonyme John Cockerill of Seraing in Belgium {{delivered}} {{four new}} 2-6-2+2-6-2 locomotives, numbered {{in the range}} from NG85 to NG88, which were so similar to the older locomotives that they were initially designated Class NG G13 as well. However, {{in view of the fact}} that all the <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> were fitted with roller bearing axle boxes and arranged as swiveling pony trucks, compared to the Class NG G13 of which the inner <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> were built to the Gölsdorf system which allowed the axle some lateral movement, it was soon decided to reclassify them to Class NG G16.|$|E

50|$|In service, {{difficulty}} was {{experienced with}} the trailing bogie wheels fouling the firebox and {{the heads of}} stays and rivets. This was partially overcome by fitting stops to the engine frame, but this restriction of the sideways movement of the bogie wheels resulted in derailments in tight curves such as on diverging points. The engines performed well at relatively low speeds, but were prone to serious lateral oscillations at higher speeds. Cases of derailment on straight track at speed demonstrated the limitations of a design {{where there was no}} leading <b>carrying</b> <b>wheel</b> to stabilise the engine and considerable overhang of the cylinders.|$|R

50|$|The {{locomotives}} were superheated, with Heusinger valve gear, piston {{valves and}} outside plate frames. Since {{they were to}} be used across the Namib Desert, they were equipped with dust covers to protect the motion from wind-blown sand. Their leading and trailing <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> were not mounted in separate bogie trucks, but were rigidly mounted and arranged as radial axles to allow for sideways motion of the wheels in relation to the locomotive frame. This resulted in a rigid wheelbase of 17 ft, even though the leading <b>carrying</b> <b>wheels</b> were arranged to the rear instead of ahead of the cylinders.|$|E
