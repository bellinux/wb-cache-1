25|$|Thrilling is {{the process}} of {{threading}} and drilling (accomplished in the reverse order) internal threads using a specialized cutting tool on a CNC mill. The cutting tool tip is shaped like a drill or center-cutting endmill, while the body has a thread-shaped form with a <b>countersink</b> <b>cutter</b> form near the shank. The cutter first plunges to drill the hole. Then the thread is circularly interpolated just like the multiple-form cutter described above. This tool drills, chamfers, and threads a hole all in one compact cycle. The advantage is this process eliminates a tool, tool-holder, and tool change. The disadvantage is that the process is limited to hole depth no greater than three times the diameter of the tool.|$|E
50|$|Good chatter-free {{results can}} usually be had by {{countersinking}} by hand (as opposed to running the tool in a powered spindle). The slow speed and sensitive feed tend to prevent chatter. With a quarter-inch-hex shank, the <b>countersink</b> <b>cutter</b> can be held with a screwdriver handle of the indexable - bit type.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{geometry}} of a <b>countersink</b> (<b>cutter)</b> inherently {{can be applied}} to the plunging applications described above (axial feed only) and also to other milling applications (sideways traversal). Therefore, countersinks overlap in form, function, and sometimes name with chamfering endmills (endmills with angled tips). Regardless of the name given to the cutter, the surface being generated may be a conical chamfer (plunging applications) or a beveled corner for the intersection of two planes (traversing applications).|$|E
5000|$|Small (c. 1/4" [...] diameter) {{threaded}} {{drill bits}} and countersinks {{are common in}} aircraft metal work. Threaded drill bits may be held in drills meant to reach into very tight spaces, and threaded <b>countersink</b> <b>cutters</b> are widely used (along with finely adjustable depth stops) to create holes which put a matching rivet directly flush with the surface.|$|R
50|$|It {{can often}} be {{difficult}} to avoid chatter (also known as machining vibrations) when cutting with <b>countersink</b> <b>cutters.</b> As usual in machining, the shorter and more rigid the setup, the better. Better-quality fluted <b>countersink</b> <b>cutters</b> sometimes have the flutes (or at least one flute) at an irregular pitching. This variation in pitching reduces the chance of the cutting edges setting up a harmonic action and leaving an undulated surface. This surface ripple is also dependent on the surface speed of the cutting edges, material type, and applied pressure (or feed rate); once started {{it is hard to}} remove. Too light a feed tends to increase chatter risk. As in many other machining operations, an appropriate response to the chatter may be to decrease speed and increase feed. On a drill press, the slowest available spindle speed is usually best. With a variable-speed handheld power drill, the trigger is best squeezed lightly to yield a low spindle speed.|$|R
25|$|A {{countersink}} is a conical hole {{cut into}} a manufactured object; a countersink bit (sometimes called simply <b>countersink)</b> is the <b>cutter</b> used to cut such a hole. A common use {{is to allow}} {{the head of a}} bolt or screw, with a shape exactly matching the countersunk hole, to sit flush with or {{below the surface of the}} surrounding material. (By comparison, a counterbore makes a flat-bottomed hole that might be used with a hex-headed capscrew.) A countersink may also be used to remove the burr left from a drilling or tapping operation.|$|R
50|$|The fluted <b>countersink</b> <b>cutter</b> is used {{to provide}} a heavy chamfer in the {{entrance}} to a drilled hole. This may be required to allow the correct seating for a countersunk-head screw or to provide the lead in for a second machining operation such as tapping. Countersink cutters are manufactured with six common angles, which are 60°, 82°, 90°, 100°, 110°, or 120°, with the two most common of those being 82° and 90°. Countersunk-head screws that follow the Unified Thread Standard very often have an 82° angle, and screws that follow the ISO standard very often have a 90° angle. Throughout the aerospace industry, countersunk fasteners typically have an angle of 100°.|$|E
