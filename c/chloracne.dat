5|$|In 2004, then-presidential {{candidate}} Viktor Yushchenko of Ukraine was poisoned {{with a large}} dose of TCDD. His blood TCDD concentration {{was measured}} 108,000 pg/g of fat, which is the second highest ever measured. This concentration implies a dose exceeding 2mg, or 25 μg/kg of body weight. Also he suffered from <b>chloracne</b> for many years, but again after initial malaise, other symptoms or abnormal laboratory findings were few.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, {{thousands}} of inhabitants of Seveso, Italy {{were exposed to}} TCDD after an accidental release of several kilograms of TCDD from a pressure tank. A number of animals died, and high concentrations of TCDD, up to 56,000 pg/g of fat, were noted especially in children playing outside and eating local food. The acute effects were limited to about 200 cases of <b>chloracne.</b> Long-term effects seem to include a slight excess of multiple myeloma and myeloid leukaemia, {{as well as some}} developmental effects such as disturbed development of teeth and excess of girls born to fathers who were exposed as children. Several other long-term effects have been suspected, but the evidence is not very strong.|$|E
5|$|In Vienna, {{two women}} were {{poisoned}} at their workplace in 1997, and the measured concentrations {{in one of them}} were the highest ever measured in a human being, 144,000 pg/g of fat. This is about one hundred thousandfold compared with TCDD concentrations in most people today, and about ten thousandfold compared with the sum of all dioxin-like compounds in young people today. She survived but suffered from difficult <b>chloracne</b> for several years. The poisoning likely happened in October 1997, but was not discovered until April 1998. At the institute where the women worked as secretaries, high concentrations of TCDD were found in one of the labs, suggesting that the compound had been produced there. The police investigation failed to find clear evidence and no one was ever prosecuted. Aside from malaise and amenorrhea there were surprisingly few other symptoms or abnormal laboratory findings.|$|E
25|$|British {{toxicologist}} Professor John Henry of St Mary's Hospital in London {{declared the}} changes in Yushchenko's face were due to <b>chloracne,</b> which results from dioxin poisoning. Dutch toxicologist Bram Brouwer also stated his changes in appearance {{were the result of}} <b>chloracne,</b> and found dioxin levels in Yushchenko's blood 6,000 times above normal.|$|E
25|$|In a 2001 case study, {{physicians}} reported clinical {{changes in}} a 30-year-old {{woman who had been}} exposed to a massive dosage (144,000 pg/g blood fat) of dioxin equal to 16,000 times the normal body level; the highest dose of dioxin ever recorded in a human. She suffered from <b>chloracne,</b> nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, loss of appetite, leukocytosis, anemia, amenorrhoea and thrombocytopenia. However, other notable laboratory tests, such as immune function tests, were relatively normal. The same study also covered a second subject who had received a dosage equivalent to 2,900 times the normal level, who apparently suffered no notable negative effects other than <b>chloracne.</b> These patients were provided with olestra to accelerate dioxin elimination.|$|E
25|$|Several {{epidemiological}} studies have observed {{a correlation between}} high levels of dioxins and PCBs in humans and {{a wide variety of}} adverse health effects e.g. <b>chloracne,</b> lowering of IQ, dysfunction of the thyroid gland and reduction of thyroid hormone levels, elevated rates of endometriosis in women, higher levels of diabetes in women, precocious puberty in females and subtle developmental delay in children, as evidenced by altered play activity. Males appear to be more sensitive to poisoning by high levels of dioxins & dioxin-like PCBs {{and are more likely to}} develop severe symptoms e.g. young men poisoned by TCDD (the most toxic dioxin) are less likely to father boys. See Geusau et al. (2001) who describe the clinical manifestations of two extremely severe (and probably criminal) dioxin poisoning cases.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} observed health effects in people exposed to extremely {{high levels of}} PCBs are skin conditions, such as <b>chloracne</b> and rashes, but these {{were known to be}} symptoms of acute systemic poisoning dating back to 1922. Studies in workers exposed to PCBs have shown changes in blood and urine that may indicate liver damage. In Japan in 1968, 280kg of PCB-contaminated rice bran oil was used as chicken feed, resulting in a mass poisoning, known as Yushō disease, in over 1800 people. Common symptoms included dermal and ocular lesions, irregular menstrual cycles and lowered immune responses. Other symptoms included fatigue, headaches, coughs, and unusual skin sores. Additionally, in children, there were reports of poor cognitive development. Women exposed to PCBs before or during pregnancy can give birth to children with lowered cognitive ability, immune compromise, and motor control problems.|$|E
500|$|Many skin {{conditions}} can mimic acne vulgaris and are collectively known as acneiform eruptions. [...] Such conditions include angiofibromas, epidermal cysts, flat warts, folliculitis, keratosis pilaris, milia, perioral dermatitis, and rosacea, among others. Age is one factor which may help distinguish between these disorders. Skin {{disorders such as}} perioral dermatitis and keratosis pilaris can appear similar to acne but tend to occur more frequently in childhood, whereas rosacea tends to occur more frequently in older adults. Facial redness triggered by heat or the consumption of alcohol or spicy food is suggestive of rosacea. The presence of comedones helps health professionals differentiate acne from skin disorders that are similar in appearance. [...] <b>Chloracne,</b> due to exposure to certain chemicals, may look very similar to acne vulgaris.|$|E
500|$|In 1991, Congress {{enacted the}} Agent Orange Act, giving the Department of Veterans Affairs the {{authority}} to declare certain conditions 'presumptive' to exposure to Agent Orange/dioxin, making these veterans who served in Vietnam eligible to receive treatment and compensation for these conditions. The same law required the National Academy of Sciences to periodically review the science on dioxin and herbicides used in Vietnam to inform the Secretary of Veterans Affairs about {{the strength of the}} scientific evidence showing association between exposure to Agent Orange/dioxin and certain conditions. The authority for the National Academy of Sciences reviews and addition of any new diseases to the presumptive list by the VA is expiring in 2015 under the sunset clause of the Agent Orange Act of 1991. [...] Through this process, the list of 'presumptive' conditions has grown since 1991, and currently the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has listed prostate cancer, respiratory cancers, multiple myeloma, type II diabetes mellitus, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, soft tissue sarcoma, <b>chloracne,</b> porphyria cutanea tarda, peripheral neuropathy, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and spina bifida in children of veterans exposed to Agent Orange as conditions associated with exposure to the herbicide. This list now includes B cell leukemias, such as hairy cell leukemia, Parkinson's disease and ischemic heart disease, these last three having been added on August 31, 2010. Several highly placed individuals in government are voicing concerns about whether some of the diseases on the list should, in fact, actually have been included.|$|E
2500|$|Exposure to {{high levels}} of dioxins in humans causes a severe form of {{persistent}} acne, known as <b>chloracne.</b> High occupational or accidental levels of exposures to dioxins have been shown by epidemiological studies to lead to an increased risk of tumors at all sites. Other effects in humans (at high dose levels) may include: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, in {{a notable}} {{individual}} case of dioxin poisoning, Ukrainian politician Viktor Yushchenko {{was exposed to}} the second-largest measured dose of dioxins, according to the reports of the physicians responsible for diagnosing him. This is the first known case of a single high dose of TCDD dioxin poisoning, and was diagnosed only after a toxicologist recognized the symptoms of <b>chloracne</b> while viewing television news coverage of his condition.|$|E
2500|$|On December 11, Dr. Michael Zimpfer of the Rudolfinerhaus clinic {{declared}} that Yushchenko had ingested TCDD dioxin and had 1,000 times the usual concentration in his body. Not {{all in the}} medical community agreed with this diagnosis, including the clinic's own chief medical director, Dr. Lothar Wicke, who stated {{there was no evidence of}} poisoning other than the severe <b>chloracne</b> visible on Yushchenko's face, and claimed to have been forced to resign because of his disagreement. Wicke also claimed to have been threatened by Yushchenko's associates. [...] Wicke's claims led some to question Yushchenko's truthfulness and motives.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chloracne</b> is {{particularly}} linked to toxic exposure to dioxins (byproducts of many chemical processes, including {{the manufacture of}} herbicides such as Agent Orange) - {{so much so that}} it is considered a clinical sign of dioxin exposure. The severity and onset of <b>chloracne</b> may follow a typical asymptotic dose-response relationship curve.|$|E

5000|$|The {{condition}} was first described in German industrial workers in 1897 by Siegfried Bettmann, and was initially {{believed to be}} caused by exposure to chlorine (hence the name [...] "chloracne"). It was only in the mid-1950s that <b>chloracne</b> was associated with aromatic hydrocarbons. The substances that may cause <b>chloracne</b> are now collectively known as chloracnegens.|$|E

50|$|<b>Chloracne</b> is {{very often}} seen in {{combination}} with hyperhidrosis (clammy, sweaty skin) and porphyria cutanea tarda (a skin condition of increased pigmentation, hair coarsening and blistering).|$|E
50|$|Once <b>chloracne</b> {{has been}} identified, the primary action {{is to remove}} the patient and all other {{individuals}} from the source of contamination. Further treatment is symptomatic.|$|E
50|$|Secondary infections on severe or {{persistent}} lesions {{may need}} to be treated with oral antibiotics or isotretinoin. However, <b>chloracne</b> itself can be highly resistant to any treatment.|$|E

50|$|In some instances, <b>chloracne</b> may {{not appear}} {{for three to}} four weeks after toxic exposure; however, in other cases - {{particularly}} in events of massive exposure - the symptoms may appear within days.|$|E

50|$|The U.S. Veterans Administration has listed {{prostate}} cancer, respiratory cancers, multiple myeloma, Diabetes mellitus type 2, B-cell lymphomas, soft-tissue sarcoma, <b>chloracne,</b> porphyria cutanea tarda, peripheral neuropathy, and {{spina bifida}} in children of veterans exposed to Agent Orange.|$|E
50|$|A study {{published}} in 1998concluded that <b>chloracne</b> (nearly 200 cases with a definite exposure dependence) was the only effect established with certainty. Early health investigations including liver function, immune function, neurologic impairment, and reproductive effects yielded inconclusive results.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, {{research}} by groups at University of Cincinnati School of Medicine in Ohio and the University of Western Australia indicates olestra {{can be used}} to treat poisoning due to exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), including <b>chloracne</b> symptoms.|$|E
5000|$|In 1968, almost 2,000 {{individuals}} in northern Kyūshū, Japan suffered <b>chloracne,</b> among other symptoms, after chronic exposure to cooking oils contaminated with PCBs and PCDFs. The syndrome {{came to be}} called Yushō disease or [...] "Rice Oil" [...] disease.|$|E
50|$|Dioxins {{have been}} {{considered}} highly toxic and able to cause reproductive and developmental problems, damage the immune system, interfere with hormones and also cause cancer.This is based on animal studies. The best proven is <b>chloracne.</b> Even in poisonings with huge doses of TCDD, the only persistent effects after the initial malaise have been <b>chloracne</b> and amenorrhea. In occupational settings many symptoms have been seen, but exposures have always been to a multitude of chemicals including chlorophenols, chlorophenoxy acid herbicides, and solvents. Therefore, proof of dioxins as causative factors has been difficult. The suspected effects in adults are liver damage, and alterations in heme metabolism, serum lipid levels, thyroid functions, as well as diabetes and immunological effects.|$|E
