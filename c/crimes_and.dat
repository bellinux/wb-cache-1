40|$|This article {{studies the}} {{relation}} between <b>crime</b> <b>and</b> inequality <b>and</b> between <b>crime</b> <b>and</b> poverty in Mexico using reported crime data from 1963 municipalities from the years 2000 and 2005. It uses two measures of <b>crime,</b> property <b>and</b> violent <b>crime,</b> <b>and</b> two measures of inequality, one for income and one for education; it also distinguishes between the concepts of mean income and poverty (marginality). The results show a positive relation between <b>crime</b> <b>and</b> inequality and poverty in cross section regressions. When we control for heterogeneity, {{the relation between}} violent <b>crime</b> <b>and</b> poverty is lost and the regressions lose much of their explanatory power. This means that {{although there is a}} strong relation between <b>crime</b> <b>and</b> variables such as inequality, poverty, migration and others, once a higher level of crime is reached, perhaps governments cannot use these variables to decrease i...|$|R
