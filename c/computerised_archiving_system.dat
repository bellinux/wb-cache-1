40|$|Properly {{archiving}} cartographic artefacts once involved {{only the}} need of providing plan presses (or drawers) within which to store paper maps, drawings and diagrams. Access to the archive was made via manual processes that involved physically handling the documents during retrieval, inspection and return to storage. This methodology, whilst still in use, has, in many instances been replaced or complemented with electronic counterparts. The method for storing cartographic artefacts has changed {{from the use of}} a plan press to a button press (via a <b>computerised</b> cartographic <b>archive</b> <b>system).</b> This chapter traces the development of technology-based cartographic <b>archiving</b> <b>systems</b> ¿ from microfiche, to videodisc, to CDROM, to the Internet, the Web and Web 2. 0.

40|$|Abstract. A {{digital video}} <b>archive</b> <b>system</b> differs from a regular digital <b>archive</b> <b>system</b> {{in that it}} can manage {{multimedia}} resources, such as video and audio contents, as well as metadata textual documentation. Thus, a complete digital video <b>archive</b> <b>system</b> must combine various technologies of multimedia searching and presentation. This paper takes the Development of Value-Added Application on Video Archive, a sub-project of the National Science Council’s digital archive application project, {{as a case study}} to demonstrate the role of information science technologies in developing digital video <b>archive</b> <b>systems</b> and digitizing video and audio resources. By sharing our experiences and the technologies developed in our research, we expect to provide digital content providers and researchers with guidelines for the design and development of digital video <b>archive</b> <b>systems</b> and value-added video/audio data. We also highlight some difficulties and suggest possible solutions to assist in the future development of digital video <b>archive</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

Over 7,000 items were catalogued on a specially designed database, the first <b>computerised</b> <b>archive</b> of the entire contents of a world ranking artist's studio. Every item in the studio has a database entry. Each entry consists of an image and a factual account of an object. The database has entries on approximately 570 books and catalogues, 1,500 photographs, 100 slashed canvases, 1,300 leaves torn from books, 2,000 artist's materials and 70 drawings. Other categories include the artist's correspondence, magazines, newspapers and vinyl records.|$|R

40|$|Museums are massive {{repositories}} of complex, heterogeneous and multi-faceted {{information on}} materal culture; many museums are aleady creating large <b>computerised</b> <b>archives,</b> storing this information. Yet, if museum information systems {{are to be}} used effectively for cultural research and for the dissemination of knowledge to the public, they must overcome the limitations of currently used museum documentation and collection management systems. For this purpose, it is argued, firstly, that museum information systems should provide adequate support for the complexity of museum information, demonstrated in such traits as specialisation, part aggregation, temporality, spatiality, dense conceptual relationships, sujectivity and context dependency, multimediality and textuality; secondly, that they should provide access to existing, currently paper-bound information, not just normalised descriptions; thirdly, that the same integrated system should cater equally for scholarly research as for communication with the museum visitor...|$|R
