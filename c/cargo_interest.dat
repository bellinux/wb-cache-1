The interview with P&G, for instance, specifically noted that they would look to collaborate/bundle goods with a “non-competing” partner. This sort of stipulation of course adds a degree of complexity to the process. In this sense the addition of a neutral 3 rd party (logistics service provider or freight forwarder) is essential, especially when consolidating goods from a semi competing market. A freight forwarder (FF), not usually a carrier, but an intermediary between <b>cargo</b> <b>interest</b> and carrier, such as rail and road, has a major role - for example by arranging goods carriage between origin and destination.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade {{e-commerce}} has {{reached the age of}} maturity. However, there are still some growing pains remaining. An important one is the delivery method of parcels, both the strength of e-commerce as the Achilles heel. First of all, the costs of delivery are substantial. If the <b>cargo</b> <b>interest</b> decides to use his right of withdrawal, such costs remain with the webshop. Moreover, parcels get lost or damaged during delivery, while the risk remains with the webshop and the recourse possibilities against the carrier are often very limited. Finally, e-commerce still can`t provide the same consumer experience as physical sales, as consumers can`t “test” their orders. Even though this is possible at home, the consumer has to pay the costs of reshipment and might see the time investment of reshipment as an obstacle. Webshops meet these concerns by providing for free reshipment, but this further increases the costs. In this paper, two alternatives to deal with these obstacles are introduced. The first one is cooperative e-commerce, whereby different specialized webshops act as mutual delivery points, where parcels of the other webshops can be picked up, tested and left behind in case of a change of preferences. This creates a proximity without having to engage in expensive delivery at home. In the second model this role is performed by individual loyal consumers, who will play a role as ambassadors and accept delivery at home for consumers choosing this delivery point. Albeit such delivery methods seem to be valid complementary alternatives, there are different legal obstacles to such alternative delivery methods. In this paper, after investigating the current obstacles, we investigate the liability impact of both alternatives [...] status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the political economy}} of the air cargo industry in the Philippines and Taiwan in the 1990 s. The air cargo industry is an important facilitator of economic globalization and now transports 34 % of world merchandise trade by value. The Philippines and Taiwan were selected because of their central location in East Asia, a region highly dependent on air cargo-facilitated trade. The growing economic role of air cargo service clashes with the propensity of national governments to protect domestic air <b>cargo</b> <b>interests</b> from air <b>cargo</b> transnational corporations (TNCs). The primary question addressed in this research is to determine what factors influenced air cargo policy decisions by the Philippines and Taiwan during the 1990 - 1999 timeframe. A levels-of-analysis empirical approach is utilized that includes causal factors emanating from domestic and international sources, including interests, institutions, and ideas. The potential contribution of crises to policy outcomes is also considered. The themes that emerge from this research are the interplay between interests and domestic political institutions on policy outcomes; the role of TNCs as political actors; the influence of state-state bargaining on commercial policy outcomes; and the constraints imposed by international institutions on national decision-makers. The empirical argument presented is that economic globalization and the rise of TNCs are challenging the ability of national governments to pursue independent commercial policies for some, but not all, air cargo issue-areas. It is also argued that the structure of domestic political institutions {{plays an important role in}} policy outcomes by attenuating the influence of air <b>cargo</b> <b>interests...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Wadi Sudr Is a {{judgment}} of another EU Member State, that a London arbitration agreement is not {{incorporated into a}} bill of lading, to be recognised and given effect to in England? This question has been considered by the Court of Appeal in National Navigation Co v. Endesa Generacion SA (The Wadi Sudr) 1 and decided unanimously in the affirmative, at least where that judgment is obtained before the English court has made a declaration as to {{the validity of the}} arbitration agreement. The position where the timing is reversed is considered obiter. The facts The case concerned a bill of lading dispute. The owners of the Wadi Sudr, National Navigation Co, carried coal from Indonesia for delivery in Ferrol, Spain. The vessel sustained damage to her rudder and it was necessary to discharge the cargo short of destination at Carboneras in south-east Spain. The bill of lading was in the Congenbill form, which incorporates the “Law and Arbitration clause” of the “charterparty dated as overleaf”, but no date was given. There were three charterparties: a head time charter, a sub-time charter and a voyage charterparty between the sub-time charterers, Morgan Stanley Capital Group, and the cargo interests’ co-subsidiary, Carboex SA. The day the owners’ solicitor was instructed, on 18 January 2008, he asked for a copy of the voyage charterparty. On 22 January, he was informed that Carboex did not wish to release this charterparty to third parties and, further, by the solicitor acting for Carboex, that the voyage charterparty provided for English law and London arbitration. Despite repeated requests, the charterparty was not disclosed. It became clear from the terms of the security they requested from the owners on 21 January that the <b>cargo</b> <b>interests</b> wished to have the dispute determined by the Spanish court. The reason that <b>cargo</b> <b>interests</b> preferred the jurisdiction of the Spanish courts was that, if Spanish law applied, the owners {{would not be able to}} raise a defence based on due diligence under the Hague-Visby Rules, because Spanish law imposed absolute liability on the carrier, except for Acts of God and force majeure. 2 The jurisdiction race was on. On 23 January, <b>cargo</b> <b>interests</b> applied for a warrant to arrest the vessel in Spain.

In spite of significant support for the policy of growing the volume of short sea shipping in Europe, and the signing of a Memorandum of Cooperation within NAFTA in 2003, there has not been the level of adoption by <b>cargo</b> <b>interests</b> or shipping lines expected. In Australia, where the regulatory environment is somewhat different from Europe or North America, the industry is more focused on the bulk sector and the Rudd Government is contemplating an agenda of maritime reform.

The debate {{surrounding the}} nautical fault exemption {{has recently been}} revived {{in the context of}} the negotiation and drafting of the UNCITRAL Draft Convention on the Carriage of Goods [Wholly or Partly] [By Sea]. Indeed, the concept of nautical fault has been debated in academic, legislative, and industry circles for decades, with the issue resurfacing each time an attempt is made to modernize the law of carriage of goods by sea, either domestically or internationally. The frequency of debate by no means implies a comprehensive understanding of nautical fault. Rather, the importance of nautical fault and the role it plays in modern carriage law is often misunderstood and underplayed. The majority of commentators and <b>cargo</b> <b>interests</b> view the nautical fault exemption solely as an anachronistic holdover from an earlier era in shipping.

40|$|Abstract The seed {{from which}} the problem sprouted in the TNT-AXA case {{is the fact that}} the CMR, an {{international}} road carriage convention, refers to national law in Article 29 CMR. This Article determines that if the CMR carrier has caused damage to the cargo ‘by such default on his part as, in accordance with the law of the court or tribunal seised of the case, is considered as equivalent to wilful misconduct’, he is no longer entitled to exclude or limit his liability under the CMR. As a result, it is more likely for a German court of law to consider that a CMR carrier has caused damage by such default than for a Dutch court. Since this type of default denies the carrier the option to limit his liability to approximately Euro 11 ½ per kilogram as per Article 23 CMR, it is in the carrier’s best interest to avoid the German legal system. Initially carriers thereto sped to Dutch courts in order to gain declaratory judgments of non-liability, or at least limited liability when damage occurred. As soon as the case became pending, it was thought that the lis pendens rule of Article 31 (2) CMR would bar the <b>cargo</b> <b>interest’s</b> access to any other forum, including the German one. However, when the German Bundesgerichtshof (the BGH) determined that such an action for a negative declaration did not concern the same subject as an action for a substantive claim, parallel proceedings before a German court became an option. At that point it was no longer sufficient for the carrier to be the first to address a court. It became necessary to be the first to gain a final decision in order to bar the recognition and enforcement of any German decisions on the subject in the Netherlands. Unfortunately for TNT, the Dutch court of first instance that was addressed in the web of the TNT-AXA proceedings failed to decide in a manner that was favourable to the carrier. TNT was therefore forced to appeal, with the result that there was no final decision on the matter when the <b>cargo</b> <b>interest’s</b> insurer, AXA, attempted to have the judgment it had sought in Germany recognised and enforced in the Netherlands. To prevent this, TNT asserted that, according to Article 71 Brussels I Regulation, it is not the Brussels I Regulation but the CMR that determines whether this is possible, because it was of the opinion that the CMR would prevent the recognition and enforcement of the German judgment on the grounds that the German court had no jurisdiction, due to the CMR’s lis pendens rule. Conversely, the Brussels I Regulation only offers the option to refuse recognition because the court whose decision is to be recognised lacked jurisdiction in a very limited set of situations. None of which occurred in the TNT-AXA case. All in all, it took six legal procedures and seven years for the parties to reach the ECJ, the European Court of Justice. When asked whether the recognition and enforcement was in this case governed by the CMR or by the Brussels I Regulation, and whether some light could be shed on the meaning of Article 31 CMR, the ECJ determined that it was indeed the CMR that regulated the matter as it, in principle, is granted precedence by Article 71 Brussels I Regulation, and that it did not have the authority to interpret the meaning of the provisions of the CMR as this is not an EU instrument. However, since Article 71 Brussels I Regulation cannot be interpreted as leading to a result that is irreconcilable with one of the basic principles of the Brussels I Regulation, the favor executionis principle in this case, the rules of the CMR can only apply in the EU Member States insofar as they lead to a result that is in accordance with this principle. The precedence of the CMR can therefore not result in the recognition and enforcement of the German decision being rejected. Thus, it is only in theory that the rules of the CMR govern the matter, not in actual practice...|$|R
40|$|At present, three {{international}} conventions (one {{of which has}} been modified by many signatory states to produce a fourth regime), together with certain pre-existing national regimes, provide this entitlement to limit most types of private law liability arising in the ordinary course of the shipowner’s activities. Limitation may be invoked by the shipowner in two principal ways: by way of a defence, or by commencing a limitation action, which latter normally involves constituting a limitation fund. Whether the shipowner should take the initiative and start a limitation action, or whether he or she should wait and use limitation as a defence, will depend on the choice of fora available. Significant differences among jurisdictions inevitably give rise to forum-shopping. In the course of this book’s practical explanation and discussion of shipowners’ rights to limit their liability, the authors consider how the conflict of laws rules of various jurisdictions might be used by parties in international commerce to raise the most advantageous defence or select the most suitable tribunal to commence a limitation action. For each potentially applicable limitation regime, the book identifies the amount to which liability is limited and the tests that apply when a claimant wishes to challenge a shipowner’s right to limit liability. Among the issues brought to the fore are the following:- - right to the lowest limit versus the strongest protection of the right to limit; - circumstances under which the ship against which the action is brought may be arrested and sold; - when the shipowner’s right to limit can be challenged and denied; - action in rem for collisions; - freezing injunctions; - direct action against an insurer. The book also discusses various specific liability regimes that address damage suffered by passengers, damage to <b>cargo</b> <b>interests,</b> oil pollution damage from tankers, damage from bunker oil from non tankers, and damage caused by hazardous and noxious cargoes. As an in-depth exploration and analysis {{of the differences between the}} various limitation regimes that provide shipowners with a global entitlement to limit liability – and the broader legal issues such limitation rights gives rise to – this book will prove invaluable to any party involved in shipping disputes. Lawyers representing either shipowners (and other parties with an interest in the ship’s operations) or claimants will clearly identify the major issues related to the selection of the appropriate forum for the limitation of liability, including procedural details...|$|R

Most common strategies for the loading of different protein nanocages suffer from a lack of numerical control over cargo loading. The aim of this thesis was to create a controllable methodology to selectively load protein nanocages with the <b>cargo</b> of <b>interest.</b> It focuses on two fundamental approaches to optimize the loading: modifying the cargo by genetically engineering and exploring different protein cages. The capsid of the Cowpea Chlorotic Mottle Virus (CCMV) was used as a well-established platform for the design of new cargo loading techniques. Loading could be controlled up to ~ 20 fluorescent proteins per capsid, however, higher cargo loading ratios led to erroneously formed capsids. A new type of protein nanocage was also explored: the bacterial encapsulins. Overall, the encapsulation of non–natural cargo in encapsulins is highly effective, yet still a very novel approach in which many things remain to be investigated. From this thesis, it is apparent that the best control over protein nanocage loading is achieved in vitro, by purifying the cargo and shell proteins and carefully calculating the mixing ratios...|$|R
40|$|Abstract When a ship {{is fixed}} on a voyage charter or time charter, the {{charterer}} may use tonnage {{which has been}} chartered to him to transport goods owned by third-party cargo owners. This thesis will discuss this situation: the charterer entered into the contract of carriage of goods by sea with sender, {{but it is the}} ship-owner who actually performs the carriage of goods as actual carrier. If the cargo is damaged or lost, whether the ship-owner shall be liable to the third party? If it is the case, on what legal basis third-party cargo owners can claim against ship-owners? What is the nature of ship-owner s liability to the third party? How does such ship-owner s liability system apply to business practice? All these questions will be analyzed in this paper. Firstly, I will present the legal relationship between parties involved in the carriage where the charterer uses the chartered vessel to carry third party cargo owner goods. It is known that the ship-owner has no contractual obligations to cargo owners, as the ship-owner is not the contracting party to the head contract of carriage of goods by sea. However Section 286 of NMC imposes statutory liability on ship-owners and Section 285 and 287 of NMC cause ship-owner and charterer jointly and severally liable to third-party cargo claimants. Such mandatory liability system aims to strengthen the economic position of <b>cargo</b> <b>interests,</b> but ship-owners and charterers are still free to insert clauses to allocate risks between them as long as such the clauses do not derogate from mandatory provisions. This paper will discuss two common clauses regarding ship-owner s liability, that is, demise clause and incorporation clause. I will analyze whether these clauses are caught by obligatory provisions and if they are not, how those clauses apply in practical business. Finally I will discuss indemnification claims between ship-owner and charterer. When the ship-owner is found liable under a bill of lading, and if such claim under the charter party would have allowed him to avoid of at least limit liability, the ship-owner has rights to seek indemnity from charterer according to Section 338 of NMC. However Section 338 does not provide cargo claimants with an absolute right to redress and certain requirements must be satisfied, that is, the greater obligations assumed by the ship-owner must result from different terms contained in the bill of lading and there must be contractual basis for indemnity in the charter party. All these issues mentioned above will be discussed mainly under Norwegian maritime law, but some comparison will be made between Norwegian maritime law and Chinese maritime law. Besides that, I will also take relevant international conventions into consideration including the Hague/Visby Rules and the Hamburg Rules...|$|R

Nigeria 2 ̆ 7 s port privatization through concession in 2006 covered virtually all the ports in the economy. However, the few studies on the subject neither factored in the complexity that characterize the multiple port system nor controlled for alternative explanations of the changes in the economy. This correlational study tested the property rights theory by investigating whether the changes in production efficiency at the ports following privatization are good predictors of economic growth in Nigeria. Eight years of existing panel data were collected from Nigerian ports, providing 160 observations on several selected variables. The analyses controlled for the influence of confounding or interacting variables and addressed the complexity of the port system using linear programming. The multiple regression analysis showed that privatization, deregulation, <b>cargo</b> increases, <b>interest</b> rate, and inflation rate accounted for high variations in short and long-term economic growth. Port privatization transmitted growth to the economy through cargo throughput increases. The Malmquist linear programming analysis revealed overall but modest improvements in production efficiency changes after the privatization. By isolating possible areas of efficiency improvements, this study may inform port managers in Nigeria on ways to improve overall competitiveness. The potential contribution of the research to social change lies in clearly identifying the critical variables to economic growth in Nigeria to aid economic planning, poverty alleviation and improving the quality of life...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThree {{responses}} that reduce energy consumption and CO 2 emissions in maritime transport are slower speeds, larger vessels and slender hull designs. We use crude oil carriers as our illustrative example; these represent {{nearly a quarter}} of international sea cargo movements. We estimate the potential and costs in these which can all be described as capital substituting for energy and emissions. At different degrees of flexibility and time scales: speed reductions are feasible immediately when there are vessels available, though more capital will be tied up in cargo. Deployment of larger and more slender vessels to a greater extent requires fleet renovation, and also investments in ports and infrastructure. A novel finding in our analysis is that if bunker costs rise as a result of emission costs (fees, quotas), then this may depress speeds and emissions more than if they result from higher oil prices. The reason is that for higher oil prices, more capital tied up in cargo may give <b>cargo</b> owners an <b>interest</b> in speeding up, partly counteracting the impulse from fuel costs that tends to slow vessels down. Emission costs, in contrast, do not raise cargo values...|$|R
40|$|Metal nanoparticles, {{especially}} {{gold and}} silver, are currently {{among the most}} attractive nanomaterials due to their applications in various disciplines. The use of nanoparticles as building blocks offers an attractive bottom-up approach to produce new nanostructured materials with unique properties and applications. In this study, we have developed new and reproducible protocols to prepare gold and silver nanoparticles using various biological and chemical approaches. In particular, casein proteins {{were used for the}} synthesis of highly stable and biocompatible silver nanoparticles and spherical agglomerates. The silver particles produced by casein were tested for their pH-induced reversible agglomeration behaviour, cytotoxicity and cellular interaction by NIH/ 3 T 3 fibroblast cells. In addition, silver nanoparticles with enhanced antimicrobial activity were produced using a broad range disinfectant polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) as a capping ligand. Moreover, peptide nano/ microfibers were also used for the synthesis of metal nanoparticles/ nanostructures. In order to control the assembly of nanoparticles, we have used various templates; such as egg shell membrane and cellulose fibers (unmodified and chemically modified) to produce metal nanoparticle organic template composite materials. Heat treatment of these composite materials {{led to the formation of}} metal microwires or membranes with interesting morphologies which may have useful applications in electronics and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy. The second part of this study deals with multilayered multifunctional polyelectrolyte capsules, which were formed by layer by layer assembly of polyelectrolytes around a sacrificial template. On removing the sacrificial template, hollow capsules containing free <b>cargo</b> of <b>interest</b> inside the cavities were obtained. It was possible to incorporate nanoparticles/ quantum dots inside the shell material to act as label during their microscopic studies.

The kinetics of these drugs was studied in a long term manner in living cells (MCF- 7 breast cancer cells). Bafilomycin A 1 caused an irreversible increase in intralysosomal pH. Chloroquine caused an increase in intralysosomal pH; however after its removal it gradually attained its baseline pH. Monensin also increased intralysosomal pH which remained high throughout its presence, but upon its removal intralysosomal pH attained baseline value very quickly.

40|$|Peptide-based {{fluorescent}} reporters of {{enzyme activity}} in living cells {{have been proposed}} to complement, or provide alternatives to, genetically-encoded probes, such as those based on the Green Fluorescent Protein and its colourful variants. The use of well-established chemical methodologies – especially solid phase synthesis – and the vast array of fluorescent dyes available allow the preparation and the evaluation of compounds with different specificities, making {{a wide range of}} investigations possible. However, cell uptake of these compounds is generally poor, and normally requires invasive methods such as microinjection or electroporation. In these conditions, the usefulness of these probes can be severely limited. The discovery of the so-called cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), more than ten years ago, has actually revealed that some of these compounds can cross efficiently the cell membranes and are able to deliver hydrophilic cargoes, such as DNA, proteins or even nanoparticles inside the cell. Unfortunately, much of the initial enthusiasm dissipated when it was found that endocytosis {{plays a major role in}} the uptake process. The entrapment in endosomal vesicles may in fact impose strict limits in terms of modification and degradation of the <b>cargo</b> of <b>interest.</b> This thesis describes the synthesis of fluorescent peptides and focuses on the problem of their delivery into the cytoplasm of living cells. A negatively charged peptide corresponding to one of the autophosphorylation sequences of the epithelial grow factor receptor (EGFR), namely DADEY 992 L, was taken as an example to investigate the possibility of creating a cell-permeable fluorescent sensor for the EGFR kinase activity in living cells. The use of a conjugate of the cell-penetrating peptide Penetratin and the probe revealed an endosomal localization in one cell type, and surprisingly no uptake in a second cell line tested. Different fluorescent derivatives of Penetratin demonstrated variations in cell uptake under different experimental conditions. During this study, red fluorescent derivatives of the cell-penetrating TAT peptide were also assessed. Although they also showed predominantly accumulation in membrane-bound compartments, these appeared to be different from the endosomal vesicles. One TAT variant in particular, namely TAT(K-LRh), may be potentially exploited as a novel vector, provided that further studies will clarify unambiguously the compartment of its accumulation. To overcome the limits inherent in the use of Penetratin conjugates, a different strategy was implemented, which relied on the chemical modification of the probe with bioactivatable protecting groups. The rationale behind these modifications was to increase the hydrophobic character of the peptide and allow its diffusion into the cells. In particular, acetoxymethyl (AM) esters were used to temporarily mask the negative charges of the aspartate and glutamate residues present in the peptide sequence. These biodegradable esters are promptly removed by ubiquitous non-specific esterases present in cells. The modified fluorescent peptide was able to penetrate easily and distribute homogeneously into the cytoplasm and the nucleus of several cell lines, with a mechanism resembling passive diffusion. Unfortunately, FRET-based assays did not measure any interaction with the EGFR. In vitro analyses showed unmasking of the carboxylate groups, albeit with modifications to the peptide backbone, which may have resulted from intramolecular condensations and formation of aspartimide residues. In particular, mass spectrometry data support this model. A loss of substrate specificity may be expected to result from such modifications, which may explain why the fluorescent peptide did not appear to interact with its enzyme target despite intracellular delivery having been achieved. This work highlights the feasibility of a tailored modification of peptides, either by masking negatively charged groups as, for example, AM esters, or by conjugating to variant of the TAT peptide, for the intracellular delivery of peptidic cargoes. Further refinements may solve the problems of poor endosomal escape or backbone modifications, and may yet offer small molecule alternatives to genetically encoded probes...|$|R
