40|$|This note {{presents}} a modest {{extension of the}} very useful "theorem of the deductible" (Arrow, American Economic Review, 1963). The extension concerns ex post moral hazard in medical insurance. Under full insurance above a deductible, the marginal cost of treatment to the insured is zero, resulting in over-consumption. Co-insurance is the standard approach to mitigate that problem. Assuming that resources and consumption preferences are independent of health (to separate medical insurance from disability insurance), the optimal <b>co-insurance</b> <b>contract</b> results in the same indemnities as a contract with 100 % coverage above a variable deductible, related positively to the elasticity of medical expenditures withresp ect to the coverage rate...|$|E
30|$|Lucas and Stark (1985) {{have been}} among the first ever to start a real {{discussion}} on motivations to remit. They have pointed out the complexity of family arrangements involving migration. Traditionally, the economic literature on migrant remittances has distinguished two types of theoretical models, namely, the individual models and the “family” models. At the individual level, the researchers consider altruism and self-interest as an explanation of remittances. According to the altruistic model, migrants transfer because they are concerned about the consumption of their families in the origin countries. The intent of these migrants is to improve the welfare of their families and loved ones by incorporating the utility of these people in their own utility (Lucas and Stark 1985; Cox et al. 1996; Rapoport and Docquier 2005) 4. In contrast, in the model of pure self-interest, it is assumed that the migrants choose an individual strategy of transfer. This latest model highlights three explanatory reasons of migrant remittances, namely, the intention to return to the country of origin, investment in the community of origin and the desire to inherit the assets of the family of origin (Lucas and Stark 1985). Note that this last reason may not reflect a true individual strategy since the existence of an inheritance ensures the continuation of remittances in the long term. In this case, these financial flows are rather the result of an implicit intrafamilial contract (Hoddinott 1994). In this regard, the recent literature points out the importance of intermediate motivations that represent contractual agreements between the migrant and the family. Specially, two models have been treated: the co-insurance and the implicit contract of loan repayment. The theory of <b>co-insurance</b> <b>contract</b> implies that the family initially invests in the education and livelihood of its members and may finance the costs of its future emigration. Once installed in the host country, the migrants must support their family by transferring a portion of their savings. These new resources will allow the remaining family members to cope with possible transitory socio-economic consequences of shocks or hardships, such as sickness, unemployment, poor harvest, among others, to improve its consumption and to undertake new projects. The family is looking at this <b>co-insurance</b> <b>contract</b> as a means to reduce its economic risks and to potentially increase its revenue by diversifying income sources (Azam and Gubert 2005). Thus, migrants replace missing or imperfect markets (of credit, insurance or employment) in the country of origin (Taylor et al. 1996). According to the New Economics of Labour Migration (NELM), migration is a collective decision made at the household level. It tries to maximize revenue and especially minimize economic risks (Taylor and Martin 2001). A co-insurance arrangement can be mutually beneficial to the migrants and their family of origin. In some settings, personal risks incurred by the migrants in the host community explain their decision to remit money back home to cover those risks (Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo, 2006).|$|E
