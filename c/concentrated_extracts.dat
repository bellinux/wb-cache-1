50|$|Chaga is {{traditionally}} grated into a fine powder {{and used to}} brew a beverage resembling coffee or tea. For medicinal use, an extraction process is needed to make {{at least some of}} the bio-active components bioavailable. These bio-actives are found in the mostly indigestible chitin cell walls of the chaga. Humans lack the enzyme chitinase, so cannot fully digest raw mushrooms or their derivatives, and the digestive process works too fast for the stomach acid to take effect. Scientific studies and research are in general also based on highly <b>concentrated</b> <b>extracts,</b> and traditional Russian usage is also based on a form of hot-water extraction (by preparing zavarka).|$|E
50|$|Due to {{macromolecular}} crowding, enzyme assays and biophysical measurements {{performed in}} dilute solution {{may fail to}} reflect the actual process and its kinetics {{taking place in the}} cytosol. One approach to produce more accurate measurements would be to use highly <b>concentrated</b> <b>extracts</b> of cells, to try to maintain the cell contents in a more natural state. However, such extracts contain many kinds of biologically active molecules, which can interfere with the phenomena being studied. Consequently, crowding effects are mimicked in vitro by adding high concentrations of relatively inert molecules such as polyethylene glycol, ficoll, dextran, or serum albumin to experimental media. However, using such artificial crowding agents can be complicated, as these crowding molecules can sometimes interact in other ways with the process being examined, such as by binding weakly to one of the components.|$|E

50|$|The {{growing demand}} of the {{supplement}} {{industry has been}} one of the primary reasons for maca's expanding cultivation in Peru and Bolivia. The prominent product for export is maca flour, which is a baking flour ground from the hard, dried roots. It is called harina de maca. Maca flour (powder) is a relatively inexpensive bulk commodity, much like wheat flour or potato flour. The supplement industry uses both the dry roots and maca flour for different types of processing and <b>concentrated</b> <b>extracts.</b> Another common form is maca processed by gelatinization. This extrusion process separates and removes the tough fiber from the roots using gentle heat and pressure, as raw maca is difficult to digest due to its thick fibers and goitrogen content. Gelatinization was developed for maca specifically to mimic the activity of cooking, and to allow gentler digestion. Gelatinized maca is employed mainly for therapeutic and supplement purposes, but also can be used like maca flour, as a flavor in cooking. Available also is a freeze-dried maca juice, which is squeezed from the macerated fresh root, and subsequently freeze-dried high in the Andes.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to prove the {{efficiency}} of the nanofiltration process for the concentration of polyphenolic compounds from Geranium robertianum and Salvia officinalis extracts and to evaluate the extract’s antioxidant activity. A lab-scale cross-flow set-up using flat-sheet configuration membrane was employed for all experiments. Two nanofiltration membranes have been used: SelRO MPF- 36 (Koch membrane) and an organic-inorganic membrane (polysulfone with SBA- 15 -NH 2). When the organic-inorganic membranes were used in the nanofiltration process, the obtained <b>concentrated</b> <b>extracts</b> proved to have higher polyphenol and flavonoid rejections, in both cases (Geranium robertianum and Salvia officinalis). The obtained values were over 88 % DPPH inhibition, for <b>concentrated</b> <b>extracts,</b> using the DPPH method. The <b>concentrated</b> <b>extracts</b> obtained after nanofiltration NF 2 (organic-inorganic membrane) had the strongest scavenging activity for all extracts and almost completely inhibited DPPH absorption (92. 9 % for Geranium robertianum concentrated extract and 90. 1 % for Salvia officinalis concentrated extract).

40|$|Objective: {{the aim of}} {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} changes induced on the vagina of ovariectomized rats after treatment with soybean <b>concentrated</b> <b>extract</b> or conjugated equine estrogens and the association of both drugs. Methods: We conducted an experimental study with 50 ovariectomized rats that were randomly divided into five equal groups of 10 animals: GI received vehicle, GII received soybean <b>concentrated</b> <b>extract</b> 46 mg/kg per day, GIII received soybean <b>concentrated</b> <b>extract</b> 120 mg/kg per day, GIV received conjugated equine estrogens 50 mu g/kg per day, and GV received conjugated equine estrogens 50 mu g/kg and soybean <b>concentrated</b> <b>extract</b> 46 mg/kg per day. the substances were administered by gavage during 21 consecutive days. After that, the animals were killed under anesthesia and the vagina was removed for histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Data were initially submitted to analysis of variance. Whenever a significant difference was detected, the study was complemented with the Tukey-Kramer test for multiple comparisons. Results: GII did not show any differences on the vaginal epithelium or collagen compared with GI. GIII presented an increase in vaginal epithelium and collagen amount. GIV had the highest amount of collagen and the signals of vaginal proliferation. GV did not show any additional effect compared with GIV. Conclusions: Our data suggest that a high dose of isoflavone-rich soy extract may have positive effects on the vaginal structures of ovariectomized rats, but this action is less than that of estrogen treatment on vaginal thickness. in addition, soy extract may not block the estrogen effect on vaginal tissue.

40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Alimentar - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe Lupinus genus had {{its origin}} in the Mediterranean basin and in North Africa, with {{existing}} records of its cultivation in Egypt about 4000 years ago. The four main species of the Lupinus genus {{in the world are}} L. albus, L. angustifolius, L. luteus and L. mutabilis, being Australia the world biggest producer. The main reasons for its cultivation are human consumption, green manure, animal feed and its use as a protein supplement. The discovery of a polypeptide extracted from cells of the germinated cotyledons with antifungal properties and biostimulant ability created an innovative application for lupine: the production of a biofungicide. Damage of the cotyledonary tissue led to a decrease in protein content available for extraction. Germination of a sweet variety in the presence of bitter seeds suggested that there was an increase in the amount of protein available for extraction from sweet seeds. It was possible to obtain a <b>concentrated</b> <b>extract</b> by clarifying the extract using a thermal fractionation method. The <b>concentrated</b> <b>extract</b> was combined successfully with a number of surfactant agents, from which the most appropriate were chosen according to wetting and spreadability properties and to the concept of a non-synthetic biofungicide. The formulated extract showed a strong buffering capacity and a high resistance to stress factors such as temperature and agitation during an eight week period. Evaporation proved to be an adequate method of concentration at pilot scale as an alternative to laboratory-scale freeze-drying. The production of a <b>concentrated</b> <b>extract</b> with 20 % (w/w) protein was possible through the extract concentration with tree single step evaporations. The first two were separated by a thermal fractionation.
