40|$|International audienceThe <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> {{services}} {{is a widely}} accepted technique for IaaS Cloud providers to reducing energy consumption and improving the utilization of their resources. This technique is based on distributing all services in the minimum amount of servers. This way, the overall energy consumption of the datacenter is reduced, as less servers are needed to be active. Traditionally, {{research has focused on}} strategies for <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> Virtual Machines (VMs), but containers are changing the landscape of Cloud services. Containers are expected to optimize the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> services by reducing the amount of needed resources, thus allocating more services using less servers. However, while multiple research works have been produced in the Energy Efficiency (EE) achieved through <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> VMs, there is yet no experimental work on how <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> containers affects EE, when assuming a given Quality-of-Service (QoS) to the user. In this paper we show an experimental analysis on the effects <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> containers in the QoS and EE, compared to the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> VMs. We demonstrate that the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> containers is indeed more optimal than the one of VMs, both in terms of QoS and EE. Consecutively, we analyze how the degradation of the service is produced both in QoS and EE, and we show how QoS is the variable which is more affected by consolidation. This work provides the necessary scientific background on <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> two widely used virtualization technologies, and we believe it is useful for future works on the optimization of resources in datacenters...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose the}} use <b>of</b> <b>annotations</b> {{as a way}} to {{flexibly}} enrich a domain of interest with information concerning different contexts of use for its elements. We provide a formal model <b>of</b> <b>annotation</b> in the framework of typed graphs, in which the presence <b>of</b> <b>annotations</b> is reified through nodes and edges of specific types, relating nodes from different domains. This allows the flexible activation and de-activation <b>of</b> <b>annotations,</b> as well as the addition <b>of</b> several <b>annotations</b> from different domains on the same element. We show that annotations give rise to a category, where pushouts are the basic construct for the composition of annotation-related processes. We prove some properties of annotated graphs and discuss examples drawn from several fields. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Several corpus {{projects}} for sign languages {{have tried to}} establish conventions and standards for the <b>annotation</b> <b>of</b> signed data.

Based on our experience <b>of</b> <b>annotation</b> in the corpus project of Finland’s Sign Languages (CFINSL), we have developed six principles for the evaluation <b>of</b> <b>annotation.</b> In this article, using these six principles, we evaluate the usability <b>of</b> the <b>annotations</b> in CFINSL and other corpus projects. The principles have offered benefits in CFINSL: we are able to evaluate our annotations more systematically and holistically than ever before.
