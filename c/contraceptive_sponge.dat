5|$|<b>Contraceptive</b> <b>sponges</b> {{combine a}} barrier with a spermicide. Like diaphragms, they are {{inserted}} vaginally before intercourse {{and must be}} placed over the cervix to be effective. Typical failure rates {{during the first year}} depend on whether or not a woman has previously given birth, being 24% in those who have and 12% in those who have not. The sponge can be inserted up to 24hours before intercourse and must be left in place for at least six hours afterward. Allergic reactions and more severe adverse effects such as toxic shock syndrome have been reported.|$|R
50|$|It {{has long}} been {{recommended}} that the diaphragm be left in place {{for at least six}} or eight hours after intercourse. No studies have been done to determine the validity of this recommendation, however, and some medical professionals have suggested intervals of four hours or even two hours are sufficient to ensure efficacy. Interestingly, one manufacturer of <b>contraceptive</b> <b>sponges</b> only recommends leaving the sponge in place for two hours after intercourse. However, such use of the diaphragm (removal before 6 hours post-intercourse) has never been formally studied, and cannot be recommended.|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} methods of birth control, which vary in what is required of the user, side effects, and effectiveness. It {{is also important to}} note that not each type of birth control is ideal for each user. Outlined here are the different types of barrier methods, spermicides, or coitus interruptus that must be used at before every act of intercourse. Immediate contraception, like physical barriers, include diaphragms, caps, the <b>contraceptive</b> <b>sponge,</b> and female condoms may be placed several hours before intercourse begins (note that when using the female condom, the penis must be guided into place when initiating intercourse). The female condom should be removed immediately after intercourse, and before arising.1 Some other female barrier methods must be left in place for several hours after sex. Depending on the form of spermicide used, they may be applied several minutes to an hour before intercourse begins. Additionally, the male condom should be applied when the penis is erect so that it is properly applied prior to intercourse.|$|E
5000|$|The ancient philosopher, Aristotle, {{wrote in}} The History of Animals VII, part 3 (350 B.C.E), that to avoid conception, women must prevent the [...] "womb" [...] from coming {{in contact with}} the male sperm by rubbing it with cedar oil, lead {{ointment}} or incense, mixed with olive oil. The lead ointment was highly toxic, but the oil was proven to decreased sperm mobility by Marie Stopes in the 1930s. 300 AD marked the introduction of the <b>Contraceptive</b> <b>sponge</b> which was inserted into the vagina, so as to prevent conception by absorbing the semen. An Indian prevention recipe from the 8th Century has survived throughout time. The cervical opening was brushed with a mixture of honey and ghee and is then rubbed or mixed with oil rock salt and used to physically block semen. The sticky honey likely reduced sperm motility, and rock salt is now regarded as a spermicide. The works of Iranian author Ibn Sina (980-1037), also known as Avicenna, has shown to have had 20 different contraceptives in his medical encyclopedia.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} {{of birth control}} was common throughout the U.S. prior to 1914, when the movement to legalize contraception began.

Use of contraceptives increased throughout the nineteenth century, contributing to a 50 percent drop in the fertility rate in the United States between 1800 and 1900, particularly in urban regions. The only known survey conducted {{during the nineteenth century}} of American women's contraceptive habits was performed by Clelia Mosher from 1892 to 1912. The survey was based on a small sample of upper-class women, and shows that most of the women used contraception (primarily douching, but also withdrawal, rhythm, condoms and pessaries) and that they viewed sex as a pleasurable act that could be undertaken without the goal of procreation.Engelman, pp. 11–12.|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION. Most {{efforts at}} sexually {{transmitted}} disease (STD) protection center on condom use, but {{little is known about}} how condoms compare with other barrier methods, particularly those controlled by women. METHODS. To evaluate the effect of different barrier contraceptives on the prevalence of STDs and other vaginal infections, we retrospectively studied 5681 visits by women to an urban STD clinic. RESULTS. As compared with women using no contraceptive or with tubal ligations, women using the <b>contraceptive</b> <b>sponge</b> or diaphragm had at least 65 % lower rates of infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Trichomonas vaginalis, while condom users had 34 % and 30 % lower rates, respectively. For Chlamydia trachomatis, the reduction was 13 % among sponge users, 72 % among diaphragm users, and 3 % among condom users, although these differences were not significant. When compared with women using condoms, women using female-dependent methods (sponge or diaphragm) had significantly lower rates of both gonorrhea and trichomoniasis. Vaginal candidiasis was more common among women using diaphragms but not other barrier methods, while rates of bacterial vaginosis were similar among all groups. CONCLUSIONS. Women using the <b>contraceptive</b> <b>sponge</b> or diaphragm experience protection from STDs {{to a greater extent than}} those relying on condoms. Female-dependent barrier contraceptives should receive more attention in STD risk-reduction programs...|$|E

The first book published in the United States which ventured to discuss contraception was Moral Physiology; or, A Brief and Plain Treatise on the Population Question, published by Robert Dale Owen in 1831. The book suggested that family planning was a laudable effort, and that sexual gratification - without the goal of reproduction - was not immoral. Owen recommended withdrawal, but he also discussed sponges and condoms. That book was followed by Fruits of Philosophy: The Private Companion of Young Married People, written in 1832 by Charles Knowlton, which recommended douching. Knowlton was prosecuted in Massachusetts on obscenity charges, and served three months in prison.|$|R

In general the women were very much more positive about the products than they were about the male condom, as were the men. A contributory factor to their popularity among women was the greater control they gave them.
