5|$|Realizing {{that they}} need one big show to raise the {{necessary}} money, the brothers persuade their old agent to book the Palace Hotel Ballroom, north of Chicago. They mount a loudspeaker atop the Bluesmobile and drive the Chicago area promoting the concert—and alerting the police, the Nazis, and the Good Ol' Boys of their whereabouts. The ballroom is packed with blues fans, police officers, and the Good Ol' Boys. Jake and Elwood perform two songs, then sneak offstage, as the tax deadline is rapidly approaching. A record company executive offers them a $10,000 <b>cash</b> <b>advance</b> on a recording contract—more than enough {{to pay off the}} orphanage's taxes and Ray's IOU—and then shows the brothers how to slip out of the building unnoticed. As they make their escape via a service tunnel, they are confronted by the mystery woman: Jake's vengeful ex-fiancée. After her volley of M16 rifle bullets leaves them miraculously unharmed, Jake offers a series of ridiculous excuses that she accepts, allowing the brothers to escape to the Bluesmobile.|$|E

25|$|A {{credit card}} {{is part of}} a system of {{payments}} named after the small plastic card issued to users of the system. The issuer of the card grants a line of credit to the consumer from which the user can borrow money for payment to a merchant or as a <b>cash</b> <b>advance</b> to the user. In 1946, American banker John C. Biggins of the Flatbush National Bank of Brooklyn invented the first bank-issued credit card.|$|E

5000|$|An {{order of}} {{payments}} for every credit card specifies which balance(s) {{will be paid}} first. In nearly all cases payments apply to lowest-rate balances first - highest-rate last (however some countries, like Australia and Germany, require that payments are applied to the highest-rate balances first).

25|$|The {{winner of}} The X Factor is awarded a £1 million {{recording}} contract with Syco Music, {{in association with}} Sony Music. In series 5, this deal consisted of a £150,000 <b>cash</b> <b>advance</b> with the balance covering the costs of recording and marketing. Other highly placed contestants may also be offered recording deals, {{but this is not}} guaranteed. In series 1–3, the premise of The X Factor was that the winner would be managed in the industry by their mentor on the show. With Cowell, Osbourne and Walsh as judges/mentors, any of the three would be qualified to do so. Following the appointment of singer Minogue as a judge in series 4, the same principle could not universally apply. In fact, when Minogue won series 4 with Leon Jackson, a new outside manager was appointed.|$|E
25|$|In 1963 Cooke {{signed a}} five-year {{contract}} for Allen Klein to manage Kags Music and SAR Records and made him his manager. Klein negotiated a five-year deal (three years plus two option years) with RCA in which a holding company, Tracey, Ltd, named after Cooke's daughter, owned by Klein and managed by J. W. Alexander, would produce and own Cooke's recordings. RCA would get exclusive distribution rights in exchange for 6 percent royalty payments and payments for the recording sessions. For tax reasons, Cooke would receive preferred stock in Tracey instead of an initial <b>cash</b> <b>advance</b> of $100,000. Cooke would receive cash advances of $100,000 {{for the next two}} years, followed by an additional $75,000 for each of the two option years if the deal went to term.|$|E
25|$|It {{was around}} this time that Ol' Dirty Bastard gained notoriety when, as he was being {{profiled}} for an MTV biography, he took two of his seven children by limousine to a New York State welfare office to cash a $375 welfare check and receive food stamps; his latest album {{was still in the}} top ten of the US charts. The entire incident was filmed by an MTV camera crew and was broadcast nationwide. Although he had recently received a $45,000 <b>cash</b> <b>advance</b> for his first solo album and was earning a cut of the profits from the Wu-Tang Clan's debut album, Ol' Dirty Bastard was still listed as eligible for welfare and food stamps {{due to the fact that}} he had not yet filed his taxes for the current year. His caseworker revoked his eligibility after seeing the MTV segment, and the incident was viewed as an example of the welfare abuses that led to the significant welfare reforms enacted in 1996.|$|E

5|$|The CCF {{represented}} many {{agricultural areas}} in the Commons, and it proposed several measures to assure financial security for farmers. It proposed national growers' cooperatives for agricultural products which were exported. It proposed <b>cash</b> <b>advances</b> for farm-stored wheat, {{short and long term}} loans for farmers at low interest rates, and government support of prices, to assure the farmer a full income even in bad years. For the Atlantic fisherman, the CCF proposed <b>cash</b> <b>advances</b> {{at the start of the}} fishing season and government-owned depots which would sell fishing equipment and supplies to fishermen at much lower than market prices.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the pioneers}} of Islamic banking, Mohammad Najatuallah Siddiqui, {{suggested}} a two-tier model {{as the basis of}} a riba-free banking, with mudarabah being the primary mode, supplemented by a number of fixed-return models—mark-up (murabaha), leasing (ijara), <b>cash</b> <b>advances</b> for the purchase of agricultural produce (salam) and <b>cash</b> <b>advances</b> for the manufacture of assets (istisna), etc. In practice, the fixed-return models -- in particular murabaha model—have become the banks favourites, as long-term financing with profit-and-loss-sharing mechanisms {{has turned out to be}} more risky and costly than the long term or medium-term lending of the conventional banks.|$|R
25|$|Many {{credit cards}} {{can also be}} used in an ATM to {{withdraw}} money against the credit limit extended to the card, but many card issuers charge interest on cash advances before they do so on purchases. The interest on cash advances is commonly charged from the date the withdrawal is made, rather than the monthly billing date. Many card issuers levy a commission for cash withdrawals, even if the ATM belongs to the same bank as the card issuer. Merchants do not offer cashback on credit card transactions because they would pay a percentage commission of the additional cash amount to their bank or merchant services provider, thereby making it uneconomical. Discover is a notable exception to the above. A customer with a Discover card may get up to $120 cash back if the merchant allows it. This amount is simply added to the card holder's cost of the transaction and no extra fees are charged as the transaction is not considered a <b>cash</b> <b>advance.</b>|$|E
