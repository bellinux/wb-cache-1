5|$|An anime film {{based on}} the first novel that was {{released}} in Japanese theaters on April 21, 2007 as one of three films released at Dengeki Bunko's Movie Festival. The staff who produced the anime series returned to produce the film. The version shown in theaters was 65 minutes in length. Those who saw the film in theaters <b>could</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> short book titled Shakugan no Shana M containing two short stories written by Takahashi published by ASCII Media Works under the imprint Dengeki Gekijō Bunko. The film was released on DVD in Japan on September 21, 2007 in regular and special editions, which featured the full length 90-minute director's cut version. It was later released on Blu-ray Disc (BD) in Japan on July 27, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Scotty Wiseman, of the duo Lulu Belle and Scotty, was {{a friend}} of Lunsford's. When Lulu Belle and Scotty needed one more song to finish a 1935 record for Vocalion Records, Wiseman {{suggested}} using the song his friend had written. To make the piece appeal to more people, Wiseman added the modern chorus and replaced verses about a man appearing in court with verses about making moonshine. Two years later, at the National Folk Festival in Chicago, Wiseman showed his version to Lunsford. Lunsford was impressed with it; later the same night, he sold the song to Wiseman for $25 ($ in 2013) so he <b>could</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> train ticket back to North Carolina. Wiseman copyrighted the song and made sure that 50% of the royalties it earned were given to Lunsford until Lunsford's death.|$|E

5000|$|Madison {{also argued}} that one-year House terms would {{increase}} the amount of election fraud in the election of Representatives. His reasoning was that it takes a while for election fraud to come to light.

25|$|In late 1975 and 1976, {{the newly}} hired sales manager Stewart Halstead {{was charged with}} the task of {{expanding}} the home and European markets to stabilize TVR's future. Enthusiasm for the cars was high in the US, tempered {{by the fact that the}} cars' pricing had crept up over recent years to the point where the same money <b>could</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> new Corvette. Opportunities continued to expand in Europe, where dealerships opened in Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.|$|E
25|$|Strict wartime food {{rationing}} {{meant that}} food {{had to be}} found wherever possible. The town’s parks, recreation grounds, open spaces and front gardens of houses were dug up and converted to allotments planted with vegetables. The seafront and pier were packed daily with people trying to supplement the food rationing by landing fresh fish. There was a non-profit 'British Restaurant' at the top end of the Windsor Arcade, where families made homeless by the bombing, {{had run out of}} ration coupons or otherwise needed help, <b>could</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> three-course meal for ninepence.|$|E
25|$|As {{his celebrity}} {{grew in the}} late 1950s, he grew tired of being {{approached}} by strangers, and particularly disliked being visited by them at home. Another of his unverifiable stories had him keeping a suitcase {{by the front door}} so that he could claim to be just leaving, a practice he claimed to have abandoned after a helpful young man insisted on taking him to the railway station and had to be sent off to buy a paper so that Lowry <b>could</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> ticket for just one stop without revealing his deceit. However, he was polite to the residents of Mottram, who respected him and his privacy; he used the bus to get about the area in his retirement. A bronze statue of him was erected at the traffic lights in the village.|$|E

25|$|West Ham {{fans have}} {{taken part in}} pitch invasions and protests against the club's board of {{directors}} and their perceived financial mismanagement, after poor performances on the pitch or to show disapproval at the sale or purchase of players such as Lee Bowyer. Other notable pitch invasions took place in the 1990s against West Ham's launch of The Hammer's Bond, a debenture which would have forced fans into the purchase of a bond before they <b>could</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> season ticket. In 1992 a post-match demonstration by fans against the scheme and new managing director, Peter Storrie, before a home game against Wimbledon was followed by pitch invasions in home games against Everton and Arsenal. The West Ham board of directors were influenced by the fans' protest and announced that the purchase of a bond would no longer be required in order to buy a season ticket. Of 19,301 bonds originally available less than 1000 were sold.|$|E
25|$|The {{layout of}} the ticket has changed with time. At first, tickets were {{identical}} on all local lines, and were small cardboard rectangles, often with a hole pierced in the middle. Tickets then became orange, with a white strip on one end for stamping information about the station and time of validation. The SKM then moved to light blue tickets, also with a white stripe which were only valid on its lines. Originally, this new layout had a list of stops printed on the reverse. Recently, this {{has been replaced by}} advertisements, or information about the possibility of advertising. There are also blank tickets, sold by train conductors to sell tickets at stops where no ticket office is available. These have a list of stops with boxes to note start and destination of the journey, type of discount (if any) and number of tickets. An extra fee for sale on the train can also be noted on these tickets, for instance if a passenger boards at a stop where he <b>could</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> ticket normally.|$|E
25|$|After {{the success}} of her first three movies, Shirley's parents {{realized}} that their daughter was not being paid enough money. Her image also began to appear on numerous commercial products without her legal authorization and without compensation. To get control over the corporate unlicensed use of her image and to negotiate with Fox, Temple's parents hired lawyer Loyd Wright to represent them. On July 18, 1934, the contractual salary was raised to $1,000 a week and her mother's salary was raised to $250 a week, with an additional $15,000 bonus for each movie finished. Temple's original contract for $150 per week is equivalent to $2,750 in 2015, adjusted for inflation. However, the economic value of $150 during the Great Depression was equal to $18,500. The subsequent salary increase to $1,000 weekly had the economic value of $123,000 and the bonus of $15,000 per movie (equal to $275,000 in 2015) was equivalent to a staggering $1.85 million in a decade when a quarter <b>could</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> meal. Cease and desist letters were sent out to many companies and the process was begun for awarding corporate licenses.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, A. Artemenko went to Belgium during his student {{holidays}} {{and he worked}} there as a washer of raw hides at the leather products factory. [...] "Using chemicals was very harmful and dangerous work, but I was getting 3 dollars per hour which made 42 dollars a day. Thus, I managed to earn 1,200 dollars per month. In 1990 you <b>could</b> <b>buy</b> <b>an</b> apartment, car and everything else for this amount," [...] he said.|$|R

25|$|When the new {{government}} was formed, Thiers, with no government experience, was given a lesser position, that of undersecretary of state for Finance, under Laffitte, but was also awarded the Legion of Honor and the position of state counselor, which had a substantial salary. He ranked {{as one of the}} Radical supporters of the new dynasty, in opposition to the party of which his rival François Guizot was the chief literary man, and Guizot's patron, the duc de Broglie, the main pillar. To have real influence and independence, Thiers knew that he needed a seat in the chamber of deputies, not just a government position. But to be eligible to run, he needed to own property important enough that he paid taxes of at least one thousand francs a year. His intimate friend, Madame Dosne, spoke to her husband, a wealthy businessman. Dosne arranged a loan of one hundred thousand francs to Thiers so that he <b>could</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> lot and build a house in a new real estate development at Place Saint-George. In return, Dosne received the position of Receiver-General in Brest. A seat for Aix-en-Provence in the chamber of deputies was vacant. Now that he was eligible, Thiers ran and was elected on 21 October 1830. Ten years after his arrival in Paris, he began his political career.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} fifteen, Wheatstone {{translated}} French poetry, {{and wrote}} two songs, {{one of which was}} given to his uncle, who published it without knowing it as his nephew's composition. Some lines of his on the lyre became the motto of an engraving by Bartolozzi. Small for his age, but with a fine brow, and intelligent blue eyes, he often visited an old book-stall in the vicinity of Pall Mall, which was then a dilapidated and unpaved thoroughfare. Most of his pocket-money was spent in purchasing the books which had taken his fancy, whether fairy tales, history, or science. One day, to the surprise of the bookseller, he coveted a volume on the discoveries of Volta in electricity, but not having the price, he saved his pennies and secured the volume. It was written in French, and so he was obliged to save again, until he <b>could</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> dictionary. Then he began to read the volume, and, {{with the help of his}} elder brother, William, to repeat the experiments described in it, with a home-made battery, in the scullery behind his father's house. In constructing the battery, the boy philosophers ran short of money to procure the requisite copper-plates. They had only a few copper coins left. A happy thought occurred to Charles, who was the leading spirit in these researches, 'We must use the pennies themselves,' said he, and the battery was soon complete.|$|E

Sutcliffe later enrolled at the Hamburg College of Art under the tutelage of the pop artist Eduardo Paolozzi. Sutcliffe lent McCartney his Höfner President 500/5 model bass guitar but asked McCartney not to change the strings around, so McCartney had to play it with the strings arranged backwards, until he <b>could</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> specially made left-handed Höfner bass of his own.

50|$|Since it is {{much easier}} to {{manufacture}} a high-quality linear CCD array with only thousands of pixels than a CCD matrix with millions, very high resolution linear CCD camera backs were available much earlier than their CCD matrix counterparts.

However, , it is still difficult to <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> comparable CCD matrix camera of the same resolution. Rotating line cameras, with about 10,000 color pixels in its sensor line, are able, , to capture about 120,000 lines during one full 360 degree rotation, thereby creating a single digital image of 1,200 Megapixels.|$|R
500|$|Kaiser, Allstate, Frazer and the economy/compact Henry J {{product lines}} all ceased {{production}} {{before the end}} of the 1955 model year run, partly owing to their failure to produce and market a viable V8 engine in a marketplace increasingly focused on the clout (and horsepower) associated with a V8 power plant. In particular, the Henry J (named after Henry J Kaiser sold an initially strong 82,000 units with its 68hp, inline-four power plant and optional 80hp inline-six, but starting at $1363, the consumer <b>could</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> full-sized Chevrolet auto with an inline-6 for only $200 more than the Henry J inline-4, making it economically unappealing, and all three lines underpowered when compared to the offerings of the Big Three.

500|$|Claims {{could be}} bought. However, their price {{depended}} {{on whether they}} had been yet proved to contain gold. A prospector with capital might consider taking a risk on an [...] "unproved" [...] claim {{on one of the}} better creeks for $5,000 ($4,000,000); a wealthier miner <b>could</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> [...] "proved" [...] mine for $50,000 ($40,000,000). The well known claim eight on Eldorado Creek was sold for as much as $350,000 ($280 million). Prospectors were also allowed to hire others to work for them, either on their first claim or on later purchases. Enterprising miners such as Alex McDonald set about amassing mines and employees. Leveraging his acquisitions with short term loans, by the autumn of 1897 McDonald had purchased 28 claims, estimated to be worth millions. Swiftwater Bill Gates famously borrowed heavily against his claim on the Eldorado creek, relying on hired hands to mine the gold to keep up his interest payments.|$|E
500|$|One {{year after}} the all-star {{recording}} of [...] "What More Can I Give", it was played {{for the first time}} on radio. WKTU-FM, a radio station based in New York, debuted the song without permission and played it in heavy rotation. WKTU-FM's Program Director Frankie Blue stated at the time, [...] "This song is a gift to the world. Michael and everyone donated their time for it, and it deserves to be heard. The song is called [...] "What More Can I Give", and I can give the world a song they can cling onto and hopefully make them think about what they can give." [...] It is unknown how the station acquired a copy of the song; both Jackson and Schaffel were uninvolved with it. Prior to the airing, at least 200 promo copies of the song were sent to the musicians who participated in the recording process, as well as to their representatives. Schaffel stated that he would hate to see the song not being used to raise money for charity, the intended purpose. WKTU-FM received numerous telephone calls and emails from listeners following their unauthorized playing of the song, thanking the station and asking where they <b>could</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> copy of [...] "What More Can I Give".|$|E

500|$|During the {{production}} of Tekken 7, Harada {{was impressed by the}} Swedish rock band BatAAr, and felt the game could benefit from their songs. The group originally met Harada during a Twitter conversation when one of the band members asked him where he <b>could</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> Tekken action figure in Tokyo. Harada invited the group to dine with him and presented them with his idea. As Lars is half-Swedish, he asked the band to compose the character's theme song, which he hoped fans of the franchise would look forward to hearing when playing the character. The group then went to Japanese arcades to play Tekken 7 as Lars while listening to their own music, which they found fitting. Honored by the proposal, the band said Harada had given them complete freedom as long as the song included Swedish lyrics to fit Lars' nationality. Band member Patrik, responsible for writing the lyrics, made extensive research about Lars' role in the Tekken series, as well as fan theories about him, in an attempt to understand Lars' characterization in Tekken 7 and make the lyrics fit. [...] BatAAr's theme song for Lars was ultimately titled [...] "Vrede" [...] (Swedish for [...] "Anger"), and included in both a CD single as well as the original soundtrack of Tekken 7. The band took a liking to Lars to the point where all the band members played Tekken 7s tournament mode as him, while singing [...] "Vrede" [...] during pauses. One of them even said he was disappointed that Lars never spoke Swedish in the game.|$|E
500|$|By 1935 Jack Mara had {{received}} a degree from Fordham Law School, passed the bar, and was, at age 27, the team's president. By that same year, 19‑year‑old Wellington had become the team's secretary, {{and he started to}} exert influence over personal decisions. Newman retired before the 1935 season rather than come back from a back injury suffered the previous year when the team refused to give him a raise. This left Strong as the team's top draw, and the Giants signed him to a contract which guaranteed him $4,000 but gave him a percentage of the draw that could make his salary reach a maximum of $6,000 depending on attendance. At midseason the team's attendance had increased by 15% from the previous year's record ticket sales. Although Strong was paid well that season, and took advantage of high ticket sales from games in which he was injured, many of the other team's players were not. [...] "I felt pretty damn good," [...] Strong later said about his salary, [...] "but guys like Hein, Morgan, and Burnett weren't making much more than a hundred dollars a game. The salaries the front office fed to the newspapers weren't exactly true. We had three All-Stars on the Giants making less money than most of the bench warmers on the Dodgers. Hein was the greatest player the Giants ever had, but he didn't start making $5,000 until after his 12th season." [...] Hein remarked that he felt he was well paid for the time however, [...] "I think at the time $150 [...] was probably the highest pay of any lineman in the league. It was pretty good money, even though it wouldn't sound that way now, but you <b>could</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> loaf of bread for a nickel and get a full meal for thirty-five cents in the Automat back then.
