5000|$|An {{interesting}} {{feature is}} the FETCH/EXEC stop, which is implemented in all hardware in the LINC and PDP-12. The hardware, when enabled, continuously monitors instruction execution until specific conditions are met. This will cause a PDP-8 interrupt stalling the LINC program. Simulated console operations {{can be used to}} examine memory or make other changes, such as pressing the simulated DO key. The DO key executes any one instruction on the left switch register while the right switch register may have to also be set in the case of double word instructions such as most of the tape class. Booting certain operating systems consists of executing a tape read instruction directly from both sets of switches pressing the simulated DO key followed by pressing the simulated START 20 switch. In essence, the LINC-8 implements all of the functions of the <b>console</b> <b>panel</b> of the [...] "real" [...] LINC, then uses the PDP-8 to simulate most of them.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} is roughly {{as it was}} after alterations made in 1759, with a central hall and two rooms on either side. The central hall has elegant woodwork, with an arch supported by large <b>consoles,</b> <b>paneled</b> wainscoting, and a dentillated cornice, details which are echoed in the second floor hall. The public downstairs rooms feature similar woodwork, with elaborate mantelpieces. The plasterwork in the northwest room feature a period mural, depicting the Chinese court punishments and the Buddhist cycle of hell. The second-story room was documented in 1879 to have artwork depicting the West Indies on its walls, but this work has been lost.|$|R

5000|$|In 1999, Mazda {{celebrated the}} 10th {{anniversary of the}} MX-5 with the 10th Anniversary Model, a limited edition {{featuring}} some until-then exclusive features, namely a 6-speed transmission and Bilstein shock absorbers; 15 inch chrome wheels with 195/50R15 tires; a very desirable Torsen limited-slip differential. Performance figures were slightly different, with quicker acceleration and higher top speed than the standard 5-speed model. The model's nickname among owners and enthusiasts was 10AM or 10AE (as in [...] "10th Anniversary Edition"). The car had a unique sapphire blue mica (called innocent blue in Japan) paint colour with two-toned black leather and blue alcantara seats and floor mats, matching 3-spoke Nardi leather wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, BOSE audio system, bright gage rings, carbon grained center <b>console</b> <b>panel</b> and stainless steel scuff plates. The addition of the sixth gear resulted in different performance results, with 0-100 km/h in 7.6 seconds, 0.3 seconds faster than the standard 5-speed model, according to Car and Driver, and 0.4 seconds faster according to Motor Trend. However, {{in spite of the}} 10AM's greater weight, its top rated speed increased from 210 to 214 km/h. Combined fuel consumption improved from 8.5 to 8.0 l/100 km.|$|E

To the right of that, a Backups pane has a line for each day—most-recent to least-recent—of the past week, showing the total number of bytes backed up followed by a bar graph that breaks that total down into alternating-color segments by Source—sequenced in reverse order of the Source's time of backup. When the cursor is hovered over a bar graph segment in the Backups panel, the Source's name and a count of files and bytes backed up appear. Below these panes are two Sources panes; the left one shows a line for each Source backed up in the last 7 days in most-recent to least-recent sequence; the right one shows a line for each Source not backed up in the past 7 days. Below the Sources panes is a Storage pane with a line for each Media Set in ascending last-modified-date sequence; each line shows the last-modified date, total bytes used, a bar graph of the percent used vs. available, and the total bytes available for that Media Set.

40|$|Abstract {{approved}} The effects upon man of {{the environment}} in which he exists have long been of interest to investigators. The intent {{of this study was to}} determine the dominant environmental factors influencing mental and motor performance, and to investigate the existence of interaction between environmental factors. Since the performance requirements involved in operating a console are representative of numerous man- machine operations, measurements were made of the mental and motor tasks involved in such an operation. A console requiring several cue and response operations was constructed. The cue sequences were programmed to be repeated and the responses were automatically recorded. Cues included dials, gauges, and flashing and colored lights. Responses required manipulation of a foot pedal, push buttons, and a toggle switch. The <b>console</b> <b>panel</b> was designed according to accepted recommendations for optimum performance. Th...|$|E

50|$|The Jetta did {{not differ}} greatly from its European twin (at {{least as much as}} the Golf did), besides {{requirements}} such as bumpers, glass, etc. Also, North American models in general have a narrower range of specification available. For example, most models had things like a bigger engine, full <b>console,</b> door <b>panel</b> pockets, velour seating, and, later on, power steering, height adjustable steering column, and tachometer, standard. They also lacked some higher level options of European variants. The Jetta was perceived as slightly upmarket from the Golf. The level of features was always a step above the Golf (standard passive restraint in 1988, standard power steering in 1990, 14-inch wheels available for most years, etc.).|$|R

The most impressive apartment in the building is the Great Hall, which is approached via the grand staircase and its processional route to the first floor. The walls of the Great Hall can be described as a 'Graeco-Roman rhapsody', as huge marble pilasters with bronze effect Ionic capitals and metal bases interspersed with <b>consoled</b> <b>panels</b> that frame portraits from the Institution's oil paintings collection flow around the vertical surfaces. The ceiling of the Great Hall features a huge painting by Charles Sims commemorating World War 1 (the patron being Sir John Purser Griffith, ICE President in 1920). The work shows a female figure draped in what appears to be a robe or peplos holding in one hand a giant Union Flag, billowing in the wind, and in the other hand a wreath (she is identified in the ICE Catalogue of Works and Art as 'the figure of Renown, wearing a mourning veil and holding out a wreath of bays with the gesture of crowning'). Peering down at the viewer from the edge of the painting are servicemen and women dressed in uniforms reflecting the different branches of the military and above them can be seen a low-flying biplane with fixed undercarriage proudly displaying its red, white, and blue insignia.
