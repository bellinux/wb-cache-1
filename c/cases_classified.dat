5|$|PD is {{the second}} most common {{neurodegenerative}} disorder after Alzheimer's disease and affects approximately seven million people globally and one million people in the United States. The proportion in a population at a given time is about 0.3% in industrialized countries. PD is more common in the elderly and rates rise from 1% in those over 60 years of age to 4% of the population over 80. The mean age of onset is around 60 years, although 5–10% of <b>cases,</b> <b>classified</b> as young onset PD, begin between the ages of 20 and 50. PD may be less prevalent in those of African and Asian ancestry, although this finding is disputed. Some studies have proposed that it is more common in men than women, but others failed to detect any differences between the two sexes. The number of new cases per year of PD is between 8 and 18 per 100,000 person–years.|$|E

2500|$|Tourette {{syndrome}} [...] is {{an inherited}} neurological disorder with onset in childhood, {{characterized by the}} presence of motor and phonic tics. [...] Tourette's is a misunderstood and stigmatizing condition, often mentioned in the popular media. [...] Tourette syndrome was once considered a rare and bizarre syndrome. [...] It is no longer considered rare, but is often undetected because of the wide range of severity, with most <b>cases</b> <b>classified</b> as mild. [...] Tourette's is defined as part of a spectrum of tic disorders, which includes provisional and chronic tics. With increased knowledge of the full range of severity of Tourette syndrome—including milder cases—it has shifted from a condition only recognized in its most severe and impairing forms, to one recognized as a condition which is often mild, and which may be associated with some advantages and some disadvantages.|$|E

RESULTS: In phase 1, in which <b>cases</b> were <b>classified</b> by clinical criteria and information from the patient, 3. 9 % to 16. 1 % of the <b>cases</b> were <b>classified</b> as induced abortion. In phase 2, in which the structured interview was changed to an empathetic dialogue and previously used clinical criteria were omitted, 30. 9 % to 60. 0 % of the <b>cases</b> were <b>classified</b> as induced abortion.

50|$|In the 30% to 60% of <b>cases</b> <b>classified</b> as hyperadrenergic POTS, {{norepinephrine}} {{levels are}} elevated on standing, often due to hypovolemia or partial autonomic neuropathy. A smaller minority {{of people with}} POTS have (typically very high) standing norepinephrine levels that are elevated {{even in the absence}} of hypovolemia and autonomic neuropathy; this is classified as central hyperadrenergic POTS. The high norepinephrine levels contribute to symptoms of tachycardia. Another subtype, neuropathic POTS, is associated with denervation of sympathetic nerves in the lower limbs. In this subtype, it is thought that impaired constriction of the blood vessels causes blood to pool in the veins of the lower limbs. Heart rate increases to compensate for this blood pooling.|$|E
