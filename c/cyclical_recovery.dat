The largest declines have occurred in states with the largest job losses. This suggests that some of the recent drop in the national labor force participation rate could be <b>cyclical.</b> Past <b>recoveries</b> show evidence of a similar cyclical relationship between changes in employment and participation, which could portend a moderation or reversal of the participation decline as the current recovery continues. Since the beginning of the recession in 2007, the U. S. labor force participation rate has dropped sharply. Some of this decline reflects long-term demographic trends and other factors that helped push down the participation rate before 2007. But the recent withdrawal of prime-age workers from the labor market is unprecedented and may reflect a cyclical component that could reverse as the labor market recovery solidifies.

Although employment growth typically lags behind in each <b>cyclical</b> output <b>recovery,</b> sluggishness in services sector employment seemed to be a new development. In previous downturns, the services sector continued to generate new jobs.

The <b>recovery</b> of the labour market mainly resulted from a market-oriented policy approach which encompassed the liberalization of product markets, the reduction of union power and comprehensive reforms of the tax and social security system. Due to increased flexibility, the British economy was able to cope with deindustrialization without rising structural unemployment. A basic precondition of structural adjustment in the labour market was a significant wage dispersion, which allowed the creation of low-paid service sector jobs. The British income distribution is less equal than the German one, but in return total unemployment is lower. Moreover, income mobility is higher, i. e. low-paid British workers are facing rather promising opportunities for attaining higher-paid jobs.

To confirm a dynamic localisation of haemoglobin we exposed Drosophila melanogaster to <b>cyclical</b> hypoxia with <b>recovery.</b> With a single cycle of hypoxia and recovery we found a relative accumulation of haemoglobin in the mitochondria compared with the cytosol. An additional cycle of hypoxia and recovery led to a significant increase of mitochondrial haemoglobin (p b 0. 05). We quantified ratios of human mitochondrial haemoglobin in 30 Parkinson's and matched control human post-mortem brains. Relative mitochondrial/cytosolic quantities of haemoglobin were obtained for the cortical region, substantia nigra and cerebellum. In age matched postmortem brain mitochondrial haemoglobin ratios change, decreasing with disease duration in female cerebellum samples (n = 7). The change is less discernible in male cerebellum (n = 18). In cerebellar mitochondria, haemoglobin localisation in males with long disease duration shifts from the intermembrane space to the outer membrane of the organelle.

40|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the leading cause of death worldwide, {{accounting}} for 29 % of all global deaths and is set to rise to 23 million deaths a year by 2030 (World Health Organisation, 2012). Arterial bypassing, both peripheral and coronary, is usually performed with autologously harvested vessels. However, the quantity available is often very limited as well as the vessels of elderly patients often suffering from thrombus, aneurysm formation or arthrosclerosis in high pressure arterial sites. The shortcomings of autografts has led to a substantial amount of research being directed towards tissue engineered vascular grafts (TEVGs) (Kakisis et al., 2005). Currently available artificial grafts for small diameter vasculature (mm) suffer from poor patency rates due to thrombosis, aneurysm formation, and a compliance mismatch, which often stems from the inherent properties of synthetic polymers. The primary goal of the research presented in this thesis was to develop a small diameter tissue engineered vascular graft (TEVG) using the natural polymers collagen and elastin, coupled with dynamic mechanical conditioning. In this context, the aim was to develop a collagen-elastin composite scaffold with optimised intrinsic physiochemical characteristics which displayed the capacity to support smooth muscle cells in vitro while also displaying suitable viscoelastic properties. Subsequent investigation focused on emulating the anatomical architecture of native vessels using this novel collagen-elastin composite, and examining in vitro maturation through dynamic conditioning in a custom designed pulsatile bioreactor. In the study presented in Chapter 2 of this thesis, elastin addition to a porous collagen scaffold was shown to play a major role in altering its biological and mechanical response. The addition of elastin improved the viscoelastic characteristics with a higher degree of <b>cyclical</b> strain <b>recovery</b> and creep resistance, which indicates the biomaterial may possess sufficient recoil to be utilised for long-term cyclical distension with reduced aneurysm risk. Additionally, the gene expression and proliferation data suggested that the presence of elastin resulted in a more contractile smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotype, in the absence of any exogenous stimulation. This biomaterial platform was deemed to possess great potential for cardiovascular tissue engineering and was amenable to multiple fabrication methods. In Chapter 3, this biomimetic collagen-elastin composite was subsequently fabricated into a physiologically relevant bilayered tubular architecture. The bilayered scaffold consisted of a porous outer layer with an optimised microarchitecture to support SMCs, while the inner layer consisted of a dense film designed to increase the overall scaffold mechanical properties and present a suitable surface for future endothelial seeding. The properties of the dense luminal lining were shown to be highly controllable via crosslinking, which enabled the modification of the mechanical properties, degradation resistance, and inflammatory profile. These bilayered tubular scaffolds were ultimately considered highly suitable for further investigation as a TEVG. In Chapter 4, a novel pulsatile flow bioreactor system was developed which was capable of recreating the complex haemodynamic environment in vitro. The system was capable of applying physiological fluid shear stresses, cyclical strain and pulsatile pressure to mounted constructs. The flexible design allowed the mounting of variable diameter constructs and was designed to be utilised to examine the effect of mechanical stimulation on the in vitro maturation of the bilayered tubular collagen-elastin TEVGs described. In the final chapter (Chapter 5), the effect of TEVG architecture, crosslinking, and dynamic conditioning on the maturation of the grafts was examined in the custom pulsatile bioreactor from Chapter 4. Specifically, bilayered scaffolds coupled with EDAC crosslinking displayed far greater mechanical properties than single layered scaffolds and DHT crosslinking respectively. Furthermore, the application of dynamic conditioning resulted in further increases in the TEVG mechanical properties as a result of increased cell density, improved collagen circumferential alignment, and an apparent increase in vessel wall density. Collectively, this study has led to the development of a composite bilayered tubular scaffold with optimised intrinsic physiochemical characteristics to support smooth muscle cells in vitro while subsequently displaying suitable viscoelastic properties for sustained dynamic conditioning in a custom designed pulsatile bioreactor...|$|R
40|$|Articular {{cartilage}} undergoes {{cycles of}} compressive loading during joint movement, leading to its <b>cyclical</b> deformation and <b>recovery.</b> This loading {{is essential for}} chondrocytes to perform their normal function of maintenance of the extracellular matrix. Various lines of evidence suggest {{the involvement of the}} cytoskeleton in load sensing and response. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to describe the 3 -dimensional (3 D) architecture of the cytoskeleton of chondrocytes within their extracellular matrix, and to examine cytoskeletal responses to experimentally varied mechanical conditions. Uniformly sized explants of articular cartilage were dissected from adult rat femoral heads. Some were immediately frozen, cryosectioned and labelled for filamentous actin using phalloidin, and for the focal contact component vinculin or for vimentin by indirect immunofluorescence. Sections were examined by confocal microscopy and 3 D modelling. Actin occurred in all chondrocytes, appearing as bright foci at the cell surface linked to an irregular network beneath the surface. Cell surface foci colocalised with vinculin, suggesting the presence of focal contacts between the chondrocyte and its pericellular matrix. Vimentin label occurred mainly in cells of the deep zone. It had a complex intracellular distribution, with linked networks of fibres surrounding the nucleus and beneath the plasma membrane. When cartilage explants were placed into organ culture, where in the absence of further treatments cartilage imbibes fluid from the culture medium and swells, cytoskeletal changes were observed. After 1 h in culture the vimentin cytoskeleton was disassembled, leading to diffuse labelling of cells. After a further hour in culture filamentous vimentin label reappeared in deep zone chondrocytes, and then over the next 48 h became more widespread in cells of the explants. Actin distribution was unaffected by culture. Further experiments were performed to test the effects of load on the cytoskeleton. Explants were placed in culture and immediately subjected to static uniaxial radially unconfined compressive loads of 0. 5, 1, 2 or 4 MPa for 1 h using a pneumatic loading device. Loads greater than 0. 5 MPa maintained the vimentin organisation over the culture period. At 0. 5 MPa, the chondrocytes within the explant behaved as in free-swelling culture. The rapid change in vimentin organisation probably relates to rapid swelling of the explants—under free-swelling conditions, these reached their maximum swollen size in just 15 min of culture. The chondrocytes' response to change in tissue dimensions, and thus to their relationship to their immediate environment, was to disassemble their vimentin networks. Loading probably counteracts the swelling pressure of the tissue. Overall, this work suggests that chondrocytes maintain their actin cytoskeleton and modify their vimentin cytoskeleton in response to changing mechanical conditions...|$|R

The study of beach morphodynamics, considering {{the evolution of the}} beachface and the berm, in these cases is critical to coastal management. The studied area located in an embayed sandy coastline at the Portuguese Southwest Atlantic Coast, is a 308 m long subaerial, coarse to very coarse, sandy beach adjacent to the Melides lagoon entrance. In order to characterize the morphodynamics of the study area under the effects of storms (pre and post-storm) and tides (spring and neap tides) during a period of one year (April 2010 to April 2011), 26 field surveys were conducted. A survey grid with an alongshore lenght of 308 m and a widht of 14 - 40 m defined between the lower limit of the beachface and the backshore limit (entrance of the coastal lagoon or frontal dune) was used. We performed 12 cross-shore profiles 40 m apart from each other. The alongshore profiles describes the main topographic variations (e. g. top of the beachface, berms elevation, beach cusps definition). Horizontal and vertical positioning was provided by Real-Time Kinematics (RTK) GPS. The results obtained allowed to develop high resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEM) using the ArcGIS software. DEM models were use to describe beach morphologicnd changes. The nearshore wave characteristics were described by the SWAN wave model considering as boundary conditions the wave data recorded at the Sines wave rider buoy. The run-up levels were calculated using the wave parameters and the beachface slope (0. 12 to 0. 18). During the study period were documented two episodes of opening and closing of the Melides lagoon due to storms effect, and one artificial opening episode. A conceptual model for the reconstruction of the sandy beach detritical barrier that controls the opening and closing of the lagoon was performed. This study shows that the evolution of the sandy beach detritical barrier is characterized by a <b>cyclical</b> behaviour of <b>recovery</b> marked by the occurrence of storms. The developed conceptual model is characterized by rapid sediment transport between the submarine beach and the beachface. The incidence of more energetic storms (Hs= 5 m) induces the destruction of the sandy beach detritical barrier leaving open the Melides lagoon to the Atlantic Ocean. Due to storms the beach profile is destroyed and about 1. 9 x 10 3 m 3 of sand is remobilized above - 0. 5 m (MSL). Beach recovers much of its original morphology and sediment volume 10 - 12 days after the storm. At the stage of equilibrium, the sandy beach detritical barrier presents a wide berm (35 m), a berm with an elevation close to 5 m (MSL) and a reflective beachface. This study was funded by the Administração da Região Hidrográfica do Alentejo (ARH). Bathemetric source was provided by GEBCO_ 08 Grid and the wave data by the Instituto Hidrográfico (Portugal) web site...|$|R
