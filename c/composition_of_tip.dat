40|$|Atmospheric {{pressure}} chemical vapor {{deposition of}} titanium phosphide coatings was achieved on glass substrates from the reaction of TiCl 4 and RPH 2 (R = t-Bu, Ph, Cy-hex) at 450 - 550 degreesC. The coatings show good uniformity, surface coverage, and adherence; they passed the Scotch brand tape test {{and could not be}} scratched with a brass scalpel. The leading edge of the titanium phosphide films was a deep blue while the bulk of the film was reflective and silver. Growth rates were on the order of 1 mum min(- 1) at 550 degreesC. The films were crystalline, single phase with a hexagonal cell of a = 3. 49 (1) Angstrom and c = 11. 70 (1) Angstrom. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed surface morphologies consistent with an island growth mechanism. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) binding energy shifts were at 454. 6 eV for Ti- 2 p and at 128. 6 eV for P- 2 p. Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA) and electron probe studies gave elemental ratios that were in agreement indicating in most cases slightly P-rich films, TiP 1. 2, with negligible chlorine incorporation. Raman spectra exhibited bands at 245, 320, and 410 cm(- 1). Sheet resistance measurements showed typically 10 - 120 mOmega cm, indicating good conductivity. Rutherford backscattering showed a bulk <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> <b>TiP</b> 1. 2. Optically, the films showed high reflectivity at 1000 nm and showed 5 - 25 % total transmission from 300 to 800 nm.

40|$|Summary: Type III {{secretion}} apparatus (T 3 SA) {{are complex}} nanomachines that insert a translocation pore into the host cell membrane through which effector proteins are {{injected into the}} cytosol. In Shigella, the pore is inserted by a needle tip complex that also controls secretion. IpaD is the key protein that rules the <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tip</b> complex before and upon cell contact or Congo red (CR) induction. However, how IpaD is involved in secretion control and translocon insertion remains not fully understood. Here, we report the phenotypic analysis of 20 10 -amino acids deletion variants all along the coiled-coil and the central domains of IpaD (residues 131 - 332). Our results highlight three classes of T 3 S phenotype; (i) wild-type secretion, (ii) constitutive secretion of all classes of effectors, and (iii) constitutive secretion of translocators and early effectors, but not of late effectors. Our data also suggest that the <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tip</b> complex defines both the T 3 SA inducibility state and late effectors secretion. Finally, we shed light on a new aspect regarding the contact <b>of</b> the needle <b>tip</b> with cell membrane by uncoupling the Shigella abilities to escape macrophage vacuole, and to insert the translocation pore or to invade non-phagocytic cells. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

30|$|During the {{expansion}} of vapor into the background gas, the condensation process is terminated due to mixing of vapor with gas [18]. The characteristic mixing time depends on type of gas and its pressure. The channels for the cooling of formed structures are radiation cooling, heat loss due to evaporation, heat exchange with background gas and heat release due to crystallization. In the present case at atmospheric pressure with background gas flow, heat exchange plays a dominant role in cooling. Since both experiments are conducted at atmospheric pressure, the cooling can be explained considering thermal conductivities of air and nitrogen (26.3 and 25.8 mWm− 1 K− 1, respectively). Since the cooling rate is more without the background gas, {{the size of the}} particles is much smaller. In the presence of nitrogen gas, the size of molten droplets was increased due to collisions between vapor species and gas radicals. Hence, these droplets cool by convection and radiation at a slower rate than smaller droplets formed without gas. The slow rate allows the droplets to grow into tip like structures. Though nitrogen influences the cooling rate, its role in the growth <b>of</b> nanoscale <b>tips</b> is still unclear [16]. Further studies are underway to determine the <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> <b>tips,</b> role <b>of</b> nitrogen and the influence of laser processing parameters on the formation <b>of</b> nanoscale <b>tips.</b>|$|R

Rapid contraction of a sling (sheath) drives a long shaft (Hcp) {{with a sharp}} tip and associated effectors through the target cell membrane. We show that the amount and <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tip</b> regulates initiation <b>of</b> full-length sheath assembly and low amount of available Hcp decreases sheath length.

The translocated proteins are reused for new T 6 SS assemblies suggesting that tip and Hcp reach the cytosol of target cells. The efficiency of protein translocation depends on precise aiming of T 6 SS at the target cells. This interbacterial protein complementation can support T 6 SS activity in sister cells with blocked protein synthesis and also allows cooperation between strains to increase their potential to kill competition.

40|$|We {{report on}} {{transient}} adhesion and conductance phenomena associated with tip wetting in mechanical contacts {{produced by the}} indentation of a clean W(111) tip into a Au(111) surface. A combination of atomic force microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy was used to carry out indentation and to image residual impressions in ultra-high vacuum. The ~ 7 nm radii tips used in these experiments were prepared and characterized by field ion microscopy in the same instrument. The very first indentations <b>of</b> the tungsten <b>tips</b> show larger conductance and pull-off adhesive forces than subsequent indentations. After ~ 30 indentations {{to a depth of}} ~ 1. 7 nm, the maximum conductance and adhesion forces reach steady-state values approximately 12 x and 6 x smaller than their initial value. Indentation <b>of</b> W(111) <b>tips</b> into Cu(100) was also performed to investigate the universality <b>of</b> <b>tip</b> wetting phenomena with a different substrate.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the consistency and <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> functional synergies for speech movements in children with developmental speech disorders. Kinematic data were collected on the reiterated productions of syllables spa (/spa:/) and paas (/pa:s/) by 10 6 - to 9 -year-olds with developmental speech disorders (five with speech sound disorder [SSD] and five with subtype childhood apraxia of speech [CAS]) and six normally speaking children using electro-magnetic midsagittal articulography (EMMA). Results showed a higher variability <b>of</b> tongue <b>tip</b> movement trajectories and a larger contribution of the lower lip relative to the jaw in oral closures for the five children with CAS compared to normally developing controls, indicating that functional synergies for speech movements in children with CAS may be both delayed and less stable. Furthermore, the SSD group showed a <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> tongue <b>tip</b> movements that is different from both CAS and controls. These results suggest that the differences in speech motor characteristics between SSD and subtype CAS are qualitative rather than quantitative. At the same time, the results suggest that both SSD and subtype CAS increase movement amplitude as an adaptive strategy to increase articulatory stability. Although in direct comparison no exclusive characteristics were found to differentiate subtype CAS from the group of children with SSD and from normally developing children, these preliminary results are promising for quantifying the role of speech motor processes in childhood speech sound disorders.

Current models postulate a static <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tip</b> link, with protocadherin 15 (PCDH 15) {{at the lower}} and cadherin 23 (CDH 23) at {{the upper end of}} the link. In terminally differentiated mammalian auditory hair cells, tip links are subjected to sound-induced forces throughout an organism’s life. Although hair cells can regenerate disrupted tip links and restore hearing, the molecular details of this process are unknown. We developed a novel implementation of backscatter electron scanning microscopy to visualize simultaneously immuno-gold particles and stereocilia links, both of only a few nanometers in diameter. We show that functional, mechanotransduction-mediating tip links have at least two molecular compositions, containing either PCDH 15 /CDH 23 or PCDH 15 /PCDH 15. During regeneration, shorter tip links containing nearly equal amounts of PCDH 15 at both ends appear first. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings demonstrate that these transient PCDH 15 /PCDH 15 links mediate mechanotransduction currents of normal amplitude but abnormal Ca 2 +-dependent decay (adaptation). The mature PCDH 15 /CDH 23 tip link composition is re-established later, concomitant with complete recovery of adaptation. Thus, our findings provide a molecular mechanism for regeneration and maintenance of mechanosensory function in postmitotic auditory hair cells and could help identify elusive components o...|$|R

From the experimental data and the energy balance in the presheath, the dependence of the cathode effective work function ϕ on the arc current intensity and its dependence on T were determined. It was found that ϕ increased from ϕ = 2. 64 eV when T ? 2900 K to ϕ = 3. 06 eV when T ? 3700 K.

40|$|Many {{infectious}} Gram-negative bacteria, including Salmonella typhimurium, {{require a}} Type Three Secretion System (T 3 SS) to translocate virulence factors into host cells. The T 3 SS {{consists of a}} membrane protein complex and an extracellular needle together that form a continuous channel. Regulated secretion of virulence factors requires the presence of SipD at the T 3 SS needle tip in S. typhimurium. Here we report three-dimensional structures of individual SipD, SipD in fusion with the needle subunit PrgI, and of SipD: PrgI in complex with the bile salt, deoxycholate. Assembly of the complex involves major conformational changes in both SipD and PrgI. This rearrangement is mediated via a p bulge in the central SipD helix and is stabilized by conserved amino acids that may allow for specificity in the assembly and <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tip</b> proteins. Five copies each of the needle subunit PrgI and SipD form the T 3 SS needle tip complex. Using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and crystal structure analysis {{we found that the}} T 3 SS needle tip complex binds deoxycholate with micromolar affinity via a cleft formed at the SipD: PrgI interface. In the structure-based three-dimensional model of the T 3 SS needle tip, the bound deoxycholate faces the host membrane. Recently, binding of SipD with bile salts present in the gut was shown to impede bacterial infection. Binding of bile salts to the SipD: PrgI interface in this particular arrangement may thus inhibit the T 3 SS function.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a chemical treatment for the mica surface which allows biopolymers {{to be held in}} place for atomic force microscopy, even under water, using conventional, untreated force sensing tips. We illustrate the procedure with images of lambda DNA and fd phage. The phage adheres well enough to permit in situ imaging of the adsorption process in water. These experiments yield a mean length for the phage of 883 +/- 72 nm. This compares with a measured length of 883 +/- 33 nm when the phage are imaged after drying following adsorption from water, showing that the effect of dehydration is quite small. Adhesion forces between the force sensing tip and the substrate and the sensing tip and the biomolecules are very different in the three media (air, water and propanol). The apparent height of the phage and the width and height of the DNA depends upon these adhesion forces quite strongly. In contrast, changing the Hookean spring force exerted by the scanning tip makes little difference.

40|$|International audienceHere we {{show that}} the {{phosphorylation}} <b>of</b> histone acetyltransferase <b>Tip</b> 60, a target of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 -encoded transactivator Tat, {{plays a crucial role}} in the control of its catalytic activity. Baculovirus-based expression and purification <b>of</b> <b>Tip</b> 60 combined with mass spectrometry allowed the identification of serines 86 and 90 as two major sites of phosphorylation in vivo. The phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>Tip</b> 60 was found to modulate its histone acetyltransferase activity. One of the identified phosphorylated serines, Ser- 90, was within a consensus cyclin B/Cdc 2 site. Ser- 90 was specifically phosphorylated in vitro by the cyclin B/Cdc 2 complex. Accordingly, the phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>Tip</b> 60 was enhanced after drug-induced arrest of cells in G(2) /M. This G(2) /M-dependent phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>Tip</b> 60 was abolished by treating cells with a specific inhibitor of the cyclin-dependent kinase, roscovitin. All together, these results strongly suggest a G(2) /M-dependent control <b>of</b> <b>Tip</b> 60 activity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{transfer}} of acetyl groups from acetyl coenzyme A to the ε amino group of internal lysine residues is cata-lyzed by Tip 60, {{which is in}} the MYST family of nuclear histone acetyltransferases (HATs). The tyrosine phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>Tip</b> 60 seems to be a unique modification. We present evidence that Tip 60 is modified on tyrosine 327 by Abl kinase. We show that this causes functional changes in HAT activity and the subcellular localization <b>of</b> <b>TIP</b> 60, which forms a complex with Abl kinase. The Tip 60 mutation Y 327 F abolished tyrosine phosphorylation, reduced the inhibition <b>of</b> <b>Tip</b> 60 HAT activity, and caused G 0 -G 1 arrest and association with FE 65. Thus, our findings for the first time suggested a novel regulation mechanism <b>of</b> <b>Tip</b> 60. Regulation was through phosphorylation of tyrosine 327 by Abl tyrosine kinase and de-pended on environmental conditions, suggesting that the tyrosine residue <b>of</b> <b>Tip</b> 60 is important for the activation process...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{conducting}} {{this research was}} to obtain a critical {{understanding of how the}} South African Police Service (SAPS), law enforcement (LE) and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) understand the concept, policing of Trafficking in Persons (TIP). The study indicates different role players in the policing <b>of</b> <b>TIP.</b> The researcher explored the present and possible future cooperation between SAPS and NGOs in the Cape Town area. The development of policing and legal aspects concerning TIP was explored globally. Research indicates the necessity of a professional partnership approach between SAPS, LE and NGOs, in the policing <b>of</b> <b>TIP.</b> The researcher identified factors that inhibit the effectiveness <b>of</b> policing <b>of</b> <b>TIP.</b> These factors include among others the lack of training in the identification <b>of</b> <b>TIP</b> and lack <b>of</b> trust between role players. Recommendations to this effect and the implementation of the policing <b>of</b> <b>TIP</b> are made to all concerned, especially SAPS management. Police PracticeM. Tech. (Policing...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to {{determine}} whether tipping could reduce labour costs in the petroleum products retail sector. The research we present was designed on the basis of survey results gathered from Slovenian petrol stations in 2009 and 2010. We have identified the following factors in the tipping process: job satisfaction, flexibility, service quality, satisfaction, motivation and the factor <b>of</b> receiving <b>tips.</b> The analysis showed correlation between methods used to increase the value <b>of</b> <b>tips</b> and better service quality, increased financial and numerical flexibility, motivation, satisfaction upon receipt <b>of</b> <b>tips</b> and the method used to increase the value <b>of</b> <b>tips.</b> In order to decrease labour costs we propose that the management take control <b>of</b> <b>tipping</b> and integrates tips into the reward system. Also, the employees should be made aware about how tipping improves service and increases their income...|$|R
