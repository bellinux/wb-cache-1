40|$|Over {{the last}} decade {{extensive}} research {{has been on the}} way to provide textile structures with electro-conductive properties that are applied in smart textiles. Their potential use is diverse and ranges from rather passive sensors to active components, such as heating elements. For these applications textiles need to offer excellent electro-conductive properties combined with a high flexibility and drapability. This can be achieved by coating textile structures with a thin metallic layer or by <b>combining</b> pure metallic <b>yarns</b> or filaments with conventional yarns during spinning. In this dissertation, targeting on the development of different electro-conductive yarns, these two technologies are drawn on. The chemical deposition of non-conductive yarns with copper and gold was explored before the resulting metal layers were characterized. Furthermore, hollow spindle spinning was applied to produce yarns consisting of an elastic core yarn and conductive winded yarns. The yarn's electro-conductive properties were examined under different use-oriented scenarios.

40|$|The torque in single-spun yarns is an {{inherent}} {{property of the}} twisting and bending of staple fibres during the formation of <b>yarn</b> <b>combined</b> with the effect of applied tension on the yarn. The consequences of yarn torque are well known and are widely observed as yarn instability, e. g., yarn rotation under tension; local snarling and entanglement at low loads, and as distortion in fabric, i. e., edge-curl and skewing in knitted fabric. In this paper, a method for predicting the yarn torque based on the {{radial basis function networks}} is presented and evaluated. This method uses a 'universal approximator' based on neural network methodology to minimize noise during training of the network and to approximate the yarn torque {{as a function of the}} geometrical and physical parameters of yarns (twist, linear density) and the applied load.

40|$|There is {{currently}} a renewed interest for improving household and personal care formulations to provide more environment friendly products. Fabric conditioners used as softeners have to fulfill a number of stability and biodegradability requirements. They should also display significant adsorption on cotton in the conditions of use. The quantification of surfactant adsorption remains however difficult because the fabric woven structure is complex and deposited amounts are generally small. Here we propose a method to evaluate cellulose/sur-factant interactions with increased detection sensitivity. The method {{is based on the}} use of cellulose nanocrystals in lieu of micron-sized fibers or <b>yarns,</b> <b>combined</b> with different techni-ques including light scattering, optical and electron microscopy, and electrophoretic mobili-ty. Cellulose nanocrystals are rod-shaped nano-particles in the form of 200 nm laths that are negatively charged and can be dispersed in bulk solutions. In this work, we use a double-tailed cationic surfactant present in fabric softener. Results show that the surfactants self-assemble into unilamellar, multivesicular and multilamellar vesicles, and interaction with cellulose nanocrys-tals is driven by electrostatics. Mutual interac-tions are strong and lead to the formation of large-scale aggregates, where the vesicles remain intact at the cellulose surface. The technique developed here could be exploited to rapidly assess fabric conditioner efficiency obtained by varying the nature and content of their chemical additives.

Brock’s reflexive and methodical process-led approach to research is documented in an ‘experiments journal’. The research takes a biomimetic approach to create innovative structures and practice within digital jacquard power loom industrial weaving. The Self Assembly series of 11 pieces explores the transition from 2 D flat weaving to 3 D forming through ‘on-loom’ finishing. Brock uses 2 D binary information <b>combined</b> with innovative <b>yarn</b> and complex weave structure interactions on an industry standard Dataweave jaquard loom.

40|$|In recent years, natural fibre-reinforced polymer {{composites}} {{have been}} attracting {{attention from the}} viewpoint of reducing the impact on the natural environment. Currently, the use of thermoplastic resins in composites is clearly of higher potential than the use of thermoset. There are many thermoplastic polymers derived from renewable raw materials, which are also biodegradable. Polylactic acid (PLA) is one such candidate, and it shows rather good properties that are suitable for applications that do not require long-term durability or elevated mechanical performance at higher temperatures. In order to make their possible use in many technical applications more attractive, the mechanical properties of the PLA can be enhanced by using reinforcements. Hemp fibres can be considered to be a good choice for reinforcing polymer composites, due to their high stiffness, strength, and aspect ratio. Highly ordered textile reinforcements, such as interlaced woven fabrics and unidirectional fabrics made from natural-fibre yarns, perform considerably better than random non-woven mats in natural-fibre composites. At present, the commercially available plant-fibre yarns are not intended for structural composites, but for textiles, which have entirely different demands on the yarns. Thus, work is needed to tailor-make the best plant-fibre yarn for reinforcement of composites. This also includes investigation of the possibility of <b>combining</b> plant-fibre <b>yarns</b> with the matrix polymer in fibre form into one hybrid yarn (a composite preform), and how to do it (twisting or blending). It is well known that fibres provide the highest strength and stiffness when they are continuous and aligned {{in the direction of the}} applied load. Natural fibres are naturally discontinuous and conventional spun staple yarns tend to be highly twisted, which leads to fibre misalignment and poor resin wet-out. The structured natural-fibre composites reported so far are based on twisted yarns produced by long-established conventional spinning methods, mainly ring spinning. In this paper, we report our work on improving the orientation of hemp fibres in composites by using our recent development of co-wrapped yarn structures. This novel co-wrapped yarn consists of low twist and very fine hemp yarns next to PLA filaments in the core part, which are wrapped by PLA filaments. By varying the composition of hybrid yarn, it is possible to vary the hemp fibre content from 10 to 45 wt %. An exciting recent advancement has been a new family of aligned natural-fibre reinforcements, which has overcome these issues by using low twist yarns. We also report the influence of fibre content and wrap density (number of wraps per unit length) on the properties of composites. Before compression moulding, multilayer 0 / 90 bidirectional hybrid yarn prepregs were prepared by winding the hybrid yarn around a steel rectangular frame. We investigated the mechanical and thermo-mechanical properties of hemp-reinforced PLA composites. Compared to neat PLA, the tensile and flexural modulus and the strength of the PLA-hemp composites were significantly higher as a result of the increased fibre content. Impact strength of the composites decreased initially up to 10 wt % fibre loading, but even higher fibre loading caused an improvement in impact strength. From the DMTA results, it is evident that incorporation of the fibres gives a considerable increase in storage modulus and a decrease in tan δ values. These results show the reinforcing effect of hemp on PLA matrix. From the general trend in the results obtained, it can be affirmed that co-wrapped hybrid yarn with lower wrapping density leads to lower mechanical properties in the composite. The study performed with DSC revealed that the glass transition temperature and the crystalline melting point of PLA were not affected significantly after reinforcement with hemp. The crystallisation temperature of the hemp-reinforced PLA composites decreased compared to pure PLA, which indicates that the hemp fibres hinder the migration and diffusion of PLA molecular chains to the surface of the nucleus in the composites. No noteworthy differences in calorimetric data from DSC for composites were observed between the hybrid yarn preforms with different wrapping density. Future work will concentrate on efforts to evaluate the biodegradability of these developing and promising composites...|$|R
