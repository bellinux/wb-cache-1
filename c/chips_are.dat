5|$|Cassava <b>chips</b> <b>are</b> {{a common}} food {{in much of}} Africa, {{including}} the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana and Malawi. In Ghana, cassava <b>chips</b> <b>are</b> called konkonte. Dried cassava <b>chips</b> <b>are</b> also used to supplement the carbohydrate content of livestock feed in Ghana. In Malawi, cassava <b>chips</b> <b>are</b> prepared by soaking cassava, slicing it, and then letting it dry. This is the primary means by which cassava is transported to markets from production areas.|$|E

Many different root vegetables or leaf vegetables may be used. Vegetable chips may be eaten as a snack food, and may accompany other foods such as dips, or {{be used as a}} topping on dishes. In the United States, vegetable <b>chips</b> <b>are</b> often mass-produced, with many brands marketed to consumers.|$|E
5|$|In the Computer Edge case, the Australian court {{decided against}} the then-prevailing {{opinions}} in other courts (the U.K., Canada, South Africa, and the U.S.) and ruled object code was not copyrightable, while the Supreme Court of Canada in Apple v. Mackintosh reversed its earlier decisions and ruled that because object code was {{a translation of}} source code and embodied in a silicon chip, it was therefore a translation of an original literary work expressed in a material form and unauthorized reproduction of the object code was therefore an infringement of copyright. The Canadian court opined that programs within ROM silicon <b>chips</b> <b>are</b> protected under the Copyright Act of Canada and the conversion from the source code into object code {{is a form of}} translation. It further held that such translation does not include the expression of an idea in another form, but rather only applies to the expression of an idea in another language, and that a translation has a one-to-one correspondence between works that are expressed in two different languages.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>C.H.I.P</b> <b>is</b> {{not widely}} {{available}} as the Raspberry Pi is. The current platform is dead, {{with a new}} one announced but with no public details on the hardware specs or reverse compatibility with C.H.I.P [...] "version 1". Because <b>C.H.I.P</b> <b>is</b> a single-source hardware from a company who provides little transparency in its production, <b>C.H.I.P</b> <b>is</b> effectively a closed-source and scantily available platform.|$|R
50|$|In some cases, a {{dedicated}} graphics <b>chip</b> can <b>be</b> integrated onto the motherboards, B150-GP104 for example. Regardless {{of the fact}} that the graphics <b>chip</b> <b>is</b> integrated, it is still counted as {{a dedicated}} graphics cards system because the graphics <b>chip</b> <b>is</b> integrated with its own memory.|$|R
50|$|In 2000 the $500 <b>chips</b> <b>were</b> {{removed from}} the casino after {{fraudulent}} <b>chips</b> <b>were</b> found. Some <b>chips</b> did {{make their way into}} the bank due to limited security features on the chips.|$|R
25|$|Unsalted <b>chips</b> <b>are</b> available, e.g. {{the longstanding}} British brand Salt 'n' Shake, whose <b>chips</b> <b>are</b> not seasoned, but instead include a small salt sachet {{in the bag}} for {{seasoning}} to taste.|$|E

25|$|A potato chip or crisp {{is a thin}} {{slice of}} potato that has been deep fried or baked until crunchy. Potato <b>chips</b> <b>are</b> {{commonly}} served as a snack, side dish, or appetizer.

5000|$|... #Caption: MOS Technology SIDs. The right <b>chip</b> <b>is</b> a 6581 from MOS Technology, {{known at}} the time as the Commodore Semiconductor Group (CSG.)

The last number is assumed to be a batch number.|$|R
30|$|Using RFID, the area, aqua-farmer, pond, and the {{production}} quantity of each farm can be recorded in detail {{and will not be}} duplicated, thereby establishing traceability when drug residues are found. However, when a radio <b>chip</b> <b>is</b> applied to two different materials, it cannot differentiate between those materials. To overcome this problem, the radio <b>chip</b> <b>is</b> combined with a waterproof material and an irreversible system. When the <b>chip</b> <b>is</b> attached to this material, providing the <b>chip</b> <b>is</b> not destroyed, the attached materials cannot be removed. By this means, it is easier to identify the source of the material.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the first}} digital <b>chips</b> <b>was</b> created by Daniel Graupe. The digital chip, {{referred}} to as the Zeta Noise Blocker, routinely adjusted the gain in the frequency channels to help control high levels of noise. The <b>chip</b> <b>was</b> integrated in a number of hearing aids in the 1980s. [...] In addition to the Zeta Noise Blocker, there was a development of digital <b>chips</b> that <b>were</b> devoted to high-speed digital signal processing or DSP. DSP chips became available in 1982, and began to be implemented into hearing aids. By 1988, <b>chips</b> <b>were</b> produced in hearing aids. One of the major contributions of these <b>chips</b> <b>was</b> the ability to process both speech and other types of noises in real time. One major down fall of these <b>chips</b> <b>was</b> that they were massive and used up a lot of battery, which made them nearly impossible to be worn.|$|R

25|$|Originally simply {{known as}} SDRAM, single data rate SDRAM can accept one command and {{transfer}} {{one word of}} data per clock cycle. Typical clock frequencies are 100 and 133MHz. <b>Chips</b> <b>are</b> made {{with a variety of}} data bus sizes (most commonly 4, 8 or 16 bits), but <b>chips</b> <b>are</b> generally assembled into 168-pin DIMMs that read or write 64 (non-ECC) or 72 (ECC) bits at a time.|$|E
30|$|After measurement, each stick {{was removed}} from the sample and TLD <b>chips</b> <b>were</b> {{manually}} removed from the PMMA holder using dedicated tongs. One out of six sticks holding the <b>chips</b> <b>was</b> wasted because of leaks in the PMMA envelope that caused radioactive water to get in contact with the chips. Furthermore, 8 TLD <b>chips</b> <b>were</b> accidentally slightly contaminated during the removal procedures. These data points were removed from the final data as significantly higher.|$|R
5|$|Chips and salsa, {{typically}} served using tortilla or corn <b>chips,</b> <b>is</b> {{a common}} type of chips and dip dish that gained significant popularity in the United States in the late 1980s.
