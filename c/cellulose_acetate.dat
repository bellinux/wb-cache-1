5|$|Acetic {{anhydride}} is an acetylation agent. As such, {{its major}} application is for <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetate,</b> a synthetic textile {{also used for}} photographic film. Acetic anhydride is also a reagent {{for the production of}} heroin and other compounds.|$|E
5|$|Acetic acid , {{systematically}} named {{ethanoic acid}} , is a colourless liquid organic compound with the chemical formula CH3COOH (also written as CH3CO2H or C2H4O2). When undiluted, {{it is sometimes}} called glacial acetic acid. Vinegar is roughly 3–9% acetic acid by volume, making acetic acid {{the main component of}} vinegar apart from water. Acetic acid has a distinctive sour taste and pungent smell. In addition to household vinegar, it is mainly produced as a precursor to polyvinyl acetate and <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetate.</b> It is classified as a weak acid since it only partially dissociates in solution, but concentrated acetic acid is corrosive and can attack the skin.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{cellulose}} obtained from sisal, {{which is a}} source of rapid growth, was used. <b>Cellulose</b> <b>acetates</b> were produced in heterogeneous medium, using acetic anhydride as esterifying agent and iodine as catalyst, to check if the procedure described in the literature for commercial cellulose also is adequate to sisal cellulose. The results indicated that iodine is an excellent catalyst to obtain sisal <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetates,</b> but the reaction is so fast as described in the literature when, instead of sisal, lower average molar weight cellulose (microcrystalline) is used. The crystallinity index (I(c)) of sisal <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetates</b> diminished compared to sisal cellulose, but there was no direct correlation between their degree of substitution (DS) and I(c). Probably acetyl groups were introduced more homogeneously along the short chains of microcrystalline cellulose, when compared to sisal cellulose, and then for microcrystalline <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetates</b> the Ic decreases as DS increases. Using the linear correlation that was found between degree of substitution (DS) and time reaction is possible to control the DS of sisal <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetates,</b> considering a large interval of degrees of substitution (0. 3 - 2. 8) ...|$|R
30|$|A {{plasticization}} {{method for}} <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetates</b> (CAs) {{has been developed}} {{that is based on}} the reaction with dibasic acid anhydrides and monoepoxides during the melting processing. As a continuation of the discussion in the previous report, additional evidence is presented for the role of grafting oligoesters onto <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetates</b> to prevent the bleeding of homo-oligoesters from the inside of molded articles to their surface. Based on these results, a method for enhancing the amount of grafting has been pursued by varying the combination of dibasic acid anhydrides and monoepoxides. The resulting reactive meltprocessing method allows preparation of biodegradable cellulosic plastics using practical process conditions. Higher biodegradability has been found for the oligoester-grafted CAs than for the unmodified parent CAs.|$|R
40|$|<b>Cellulose</b> <b>acetates</b> with {{different}} degrees of substitution (DS, from 0. 6 to 1. 9) were prepared from previously mercerized linter cellulose, in a homogeneous medium, using N,N-dimethylacetamide/lithium chloride as a solvent system. The influence of {{different degrees of}} substitution on the properties of <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetates</b> was investigated using thermogravimetric analyses (TGA). Quantitative methods were applied to the thermogravimetric curves {{in order to determine}} the apparent activation energy (Ea) related to the thermal decomposition of untreated and mercerized <b>celluloses</b> and <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetates.</b> Ea values were calculated using Broido's method and considering dynamic conditions. Ea values of 158 and 187 kJ mol- 1 were obtained for untreated and mercerized cellulose, respectively. A previous study showed that C 6 OH is the most reactive site for acetylation, probably due to the steric hindrance of C 2 and C 3. The C 6 OH takes part in the first step of cellulose decomposition, leading to the formation of levoglucosan and, when it is changed to C 6 OCOCH 3, the results indicate that the mechanism of thermal decomposition changes to one with a lower Ea. A linear correlation between Ea and the DS of the acetates prepared in the present work was identified...|$|R
5|$|Maniac Mansions {{story and}} {{structure}} were designed before coding commenced. The project's earliest incarnation {{was a simple}} paper-and-pencil board game, in which the mansion's floor plan {{was used as a}} game board, and cards represented events and characters. Lines connected the rooms to illustrate pathways by which characters could travel. Strips of <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetate</b> were used to map out the game's puzzles by tracking which items worked together when used by certain characters. Impressed by the map's complexity, Winnick included it in the final game as a poster hung on a wall. Because each character contributes different skills and resources, the pair spent months working on the event combinations that could occur. This extended the game's production time beyond that of previous Lucasfilm Games projects, which almost led to Gilbert's firing. The game's dialogue, written by David Fox, was not created until after programming had begun.|$|E
5|$|The termite gut has {{inspired}} various research efforts aimed at replacing fossil fuels with cleaner, renewable energy sources. Termites are efficient bioreactors, {{capable of producing}} two litres of hydrogen from a single sheet of paper. Approximately 200 species of microbes live inside the termite hindgut, releasing the hydrogen that was trapped inside wood and plants that they digest. Through the action of unidentified enzymes in the termite gut, lignocellulose polymers are broken down into sugars and are transformed into hydrogen. The bacteria within the gut turns the sugar and hydrogen into <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetate,</b> an acetate ester of cellulose on which termites rely for energy. Community DNA sequencing of the microbes in the termite hindgut has been employed to provide {{a better understanding of}} the metabolic pathway. Genetic engineering may enable hydrogen to be generated in bioreactors from woody biomass.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetate,</b> the {{material}} {{used to create}} Lego bricks, {{was replaced by the}} more stable acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS plastic), which is still used today. ABS is non-toxic, is less prone to discolouration and warping, and is more resistant to heat, acids, salt, and other chemicals. Samsonite manufacturing in North America did not switch at the same time, and still used some degree of <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetate</b> in its Lego products.|$|E

Under mild reaction conditions, cellulose monoacetates(CMA) with the DS {{in a range}} from 0. 34 to 1. 60 were obtained. NMR analysis shows that the distribution of acetyl moieties among the three OH groups of anhydroglucose unit is C 6 >>C 3 > C 2 for the synthesized CMA. The water solubility measurement shows that the CMA samples with the DS ranging from 0. 65 to 1. 06 are readily dissolved in water.

30|$|Based on the {{chemical}} structures {{different types of}} soil release finishes based on polymers containing carboxyl groups or oxyethylene or hydroxyl groups are starch, carboxy-methylcellulose (CMC), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl starch, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and hydrolysed <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetates</b> etc were formulated. Fluorine based compounds containing hydrophilic moities such as polyoxyethylene, hybrid fluorochemical etc. act as soil release agents. The performance characteristics of fabrics treated with these soil release finishes can be evaluated through oily soil-release testing (Cooke 1987; Schindler and Hauser 2004; Heywood 2003, Kissa 1984; Buck and Schubert 2009).|$|R
40|$|A liquid chromatographic {{method was}} {{developed}} allowing separating <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetates</b> (CA) {{with respect to}} degree of substitution (DS). The normal-phase gradient separation, {{which is based on}} an adsorption-desorption mechanism, uses a multi-step gradient of dichloromethane (DCM) and methanol (MeOH) on a bare silica column as stationary phase. Applicability of the developed multi-step gradient allows separating CAs within the DS-range DS = 1. 5 - 2. 9, which is the target DS-range for most CA applications.

The replacement by iodine of tosyloxy and nitrate groups in the cellulose molecule was studied. At least 0. 52 of the nitrate groups in a 'bellulose- 6 -nitrate'' were definitely shown to occupy the primary position.

The method uses gradient liquid chromatography (HPLC) as the first dimension in order to separate by DS followed by separation of the different fractions by size (SEC) in the second dimension. The 2 D experiments revealed different correlations between gradient and SEC elution volume. These correlations might arise from differences in the synthetic conditions.
