5|$|The {{settlement}} of Madagascar {{is a subject}} of ongoing research and debate. Archaeological finds such as cut marks on bones found in the northwest and stone tools in the northeast indicate that Madagascar was visited by foragers around 2000BC. Traditionally, archaeologists have estimated that the earliest settlers arrived in successive waves throughout the period between 350BC and 550AD, while others are <b>cautious</b> <b>about</b> dates earlier than 250AD. In either case, these dates make Madagascar {{one of the last}} major landmasses on Earth to be settled by humans.|$|E
5|$|Although many {{messages}} were sent by agents, the Twenty Committee considered that Ironside was quite unrealistic {{and as a}} result was <b>cautious</b> <b>about</b> promoting it too heavily. Most of the information was sent with words of caution or uncertainty to ensure that the agent would not be compromised. One of the most critical Bodyguard agents, Garbo, did become involved on 5 June, but only in forwarding the message of a fictional sub-agent who he had already identified as unreliable (MI5 hoped that this would cover for, in their opinion, the implausible nature of the story). The agent's report explained that a US division based in Liverpool was preparing to head to Bordeaux.|$|E
5|$|Ironside {{began on}} 23 May 1944 {{with the aim}} of having the threat {{established}} by 29 May and continued until 28 June (22 days after the Normandy landings). It was implemented via double agents, in Britain and the United States, {{under the control of the}} Twenty Committee. The operation did not receive any resources from the Allied navies or airforce, so the deception had no physical element. This meant that Ironside had none of the traditional accompaniments to an invasion, including reconnaissance flights, bombardment, and naval operations. As a result, the Twenty Committee was <b>cautious</b> <b>about</b> using important agents to pass over the deception.|$|E

5|$|The Importance of Being Earnest, A Trivial Comedy for Serious People is a play by Oscar Wilde. First {{performed}} on 14 February 1895 at the St James's Theatre in London, it is a farcical comedy {{in which the}} protagonists maintain fictitious personæ to escape burdensome social obligations. Working within the social conventions of late Victorian London, the play's major themes are the triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage, and the resulting satire of Victorian ways. Contemporary reviews all praised the play's humour, though some were <b>cautious</b> <b>about</b> its explicit lack of social messages, while others foresaw the modern consensus {{that it was the}} culmination of Wilde's artistic career so far. Its high farce and witty dialogue have helped make The Importance of Being Earnest Wilde's most enduringly popular play.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the output}} of copper {{currency}} had expanded immensely by 1085, some fifty copper mines were shut down between the years 1078 and 1085. Although there were on average more copper mines found in Northern Song China {{than in the previous}} Tang dynasty, this case was reversed during the Southern Song with a sharp decline and depletion of mined copper deposits by 1165. Even though copper cash was abundant in the late 11th century, Chancellor Wang Anshi's tax substitution for corvée labor and government takeover of agricultural finance loans meant that people now had to find additional cash, driving up the price of copper money which would become scarce. To make matters worse, large amounts of government-issued copper currency exited the country via international trade, while the Liao dynasty and Western Xia actively pursued the exchange of their iron-minted coins for Song copper coins. As evidenced by an 1103 decree, the Song government became <b>cautious</b> <b>about</b> its outflow of iron currency into the Liao Empire when it ordered that the iron was to be alloyed with tin in the smelting process, thus depriving the Liao of a chance to melt down the currency to make iron weapons.|$|E
5|$|Friday {{was known}} at Hayes for his {{excessive}} drinking, {{and on one}} occasion the team started a match a player short because Friday had not turned up. When he finally arrived, eighty minutes after kick-off, his intoxication was obvious, {{but he was still}} sent onto the pitch with the match still goalless. The opposition paid him little attention and Friday scored a late winning goal. Hayes were drawn to play Football League Fourth Division club Reading in the FA Cup's second round on 9 December 1972; the team managed to draw 0–0 at Reading and earn the right to a replay at home, which they lost 1–0 three days later. Although Hayes had lost, the interest of Reading manager Charlie Hurley was piqued. Hurley travelled to Hayes more than once to watch Friday. Having researched the player's background, he was <b>cautious</b> <b>about</b> signing him, but was impressed all the same by his on-field performances.|$|E

5|$|On 5 September 1945, Igor Gouzenko, a cypher {{clerk at}} the Soviet Union's embassy in Ottawa, and his family {{defected}} to Canada. He brought with him copies of cables detailing Soviet intelligence (GRU) espionage activities in Canada. Agents included Alan Nunn May, who secretly supplied tiny samples of uranium-233 and uranium-235 to GRU agent Pavel Angelov in July 1945; Fred Rose, a member of parliament; and NRC scientists Israel Halperin, Edward Mazerall and Durnford Smith. Pontecorvo, who defected to the Soviet Union in 1950, has long been suspected of having been involved in espionage. No evidence {{that he was a}} Soviet agent has ever been established, but the GRU obtained samples of uranium and blueprints of the NRX, for which Nunn May could not have been the source, and Pontecorvo remains the prime suspect. When the spy ring became public knowledge in February 1946, the Americans became more <b>cautious</b> <b>about</b> sharing information with Britain and Canada.|$|E
5|$|Other British composers who feature {{significantly}} in Boult's discography include Holst, Ireland, Parry, and Walton. Despite {{his reputation as}} a pioneer in Britain of the works of the Second Viennese School and other avant-garde composers, the record companies, unlike the BBC, remained <b>cautious</b> <b>about</b> recording him in this repertory, and only a single recording of a Berg piece represents this side of Boult's work. In the core continental orchestral repertoire, Boult's recordings of the four symphonies of Brahms, and the Great C major Symphony of Schubert were celebrated in his lifetime and have remained in the catalogues during the three decades after his death. Late in his recording career he recorded four discs of excerpts from Wagner's operas, which received great critical praise. The exceptional breadth of Boult's repertoire has left some well-regarded recordings of works not immediately associated with him, among which are versions of Franck's Symphony (recorded in 1959), Dvořák's Cello Concerto with Mstislav Rostropovich (1958), and a pioneering recording of Mahler's Third Symphony taped live in 1947.|$|E
5|$|Three {{publishers}} praised The Well {{but turned}} it down. Hall's agent then sent the manuscript to Jonathan Cape who, though <b>cautious</b> <b>about</b> publishing a controversial book, saw {{the potential for}} a commercial success. Cape tested the waters with a small print run of 1500 copies, priced at 15 shillings– about twice the cost of an average novel– to make it less attractive to sensation-seekers. Publication, originally scheduled for late 1928, was brought forward when he discovered that another novel with a lesbian theme, Compton Mackenzie's Extraordinary Women, was to be published in September. Though the two books proved to have little in common, Hall and Cape saw Extraordinary Women as a competitor and wanted to beat it to market. The Well appeared on 27 July, in a black cover with a plain jacket. Cape sent review copies only to newspapers and magazines he thought would handle the subject matter non-sensationally.|$|E
50|$|In 1937 {{the inquiry}} {{published}} its findings. Despite considering management failures, {{a lack of}} safety measures, bad working practices and poor ventilation in the pit, Walker drew very <b>cautious</b> conclusions <b>about</b> the cause in his final verdict. This was largely because the two assessors chosen by the miners and by the pit's management, and the barristers representing them, had given widely different suggestions as {{to the source of}} the explosion; though Walker suggested that Cripps's theory regarding shotfiring in 95's appeared the most likely cause.|$|R

He does not try to prove his earlier views right in spite of new facts, but makes <b>cautious</b> predictions <b>about</b> how its appearance may change in future.|$|R

5|$|Throughout the hurricane's track, it posed {{little to}} no threat to any major landmasses or {{populated}} islands. During Celia's early development stages, it brought moderate rainfall to parts of Oaxaca and Guerrero; however, no loss of life or structural damage was reported. Beaches in both states {{increased the number of}} lifeguards on duty since the threat of rip currents would remain high for several days. On June22, the Sistema Nacional de Protección Civil (National System of Civil Protection) in the Mexican state of Jalisco raised the alert level to stage two for coastal areas. People were urged to be <b>cautious</b> <b>about</b> venturing out into coastal waters as the storm produced rough seas near the coast. The alert was later expanded upon to include coastal areas of Michoacán and Colima. Although out of the storm's projected path, a precautionary alert was issued for Socorro Island. However, between June22 and 23, the outer bands of the storm brought unsettled weather to France's Clipperton Island. Since this island is unpopulated, the NHC did not issue any warnings for it.|$|E
5|$|Cincinnati {{already had}} a large anti-slavery {{movement}} who had violent conflicts with slavery proponents {{in the years before}} Coffin moved to the city. Coffin purchased a new home at the corner of Elm and Sixth Streets and continued to be active in the Underground Railroad. He also set up a new safe house in the city and helped organize a larger network in the area. At first he was very <b>cautious</b> <b>about</b> helping escaping slaves in the area until he was able to find local people he could trust and the community learned that it could trust him. Although Coffin and his wife moved several times during their years in Cincinnati, they finally settled at a home on Wehrman Street. With the large home's rooms rented out for boarding and its many guests coming and going, the home provided an excellent place to operate an Underground Railroad stop without arousing much suspicion. When fugitives arrived they would be dressed as butlers, cooks, and other workers in uniforms that Catherine had created. Some mulattoes were able to pass as white guests. The most frequent disguise was a Quaker woman's attire; its high collar, long sleeves, gloves, veil, and a large, wide-brimmed hat could completely hide its wearer when their head was tilted slightly downward.|$|E
5|$|In May 1182, Saladin {{captured}} Aleppo {{after a brief}} siege; the {{new governor}} of the city, Imad al-Din Zangi II, had been unpopular with his subjects and surrendered Aleppo after Saladin agreed to restore Zangi II's previous control over Sinjar, Raqqa, and Nusaybin, which would thereafter serve as vassal territories of the Ayyubids. Aleppo formally entered Ayyubid hands on 12 June. The day after, Saladin marched to Harim, near the Crusader-held Antioch and captured the city when its garrison forced out their leader, Surhak, who was then briefly detained and released by al-Muzaffar Umar. The surrender of Aleppo and Saladin's allegiance with Zangi II had left Izz al-Din al-Mas'ud of Mosul the only major Muslim rival of the Ayyubids. Mosul had been subjected to a short siege {{in the autumn of}} 1182, but after mediation by the Abbasid caliph an-Nasir, Saladin withdrew his forces. Mas'ud attempted to align himself with the Artuqids of Mardin, but they became allies of Saladin instead. In 1183, Irbil too switched allegiance to the Ayyubids. Mas'ud then sought the support of Pahlawan ibn Muhammad, the governor of Azerbaijan, and although he did not usually intervene in the region, the possibility of Pahlawan's intervention made Saladin <b>cautious</b> <b>about</b> launching further attacks against Mosul.|$|E

We do not agree that any significant effect at all, no matter how small, is "fundamentally important" (Bösch et al., 2006, p. 2); and we suggest that psychokinesis researchers focus either on producing larger effects or on specifying the conditions under which {{they would be willing to}} accept the null hypothesis...|$|R

5|$|Saturday's {{afternoon}} qualifying session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in damp weather conditions with intermittent rain. Coulthard achieved his second pole position of the season, his first at the Hockenheimring, with a time of 1:45.697. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Michael Schumacher who was 1.3 seconds slower than Coulthard. Fisichella qualified third, though he was happy with his performance despite using his team's T-car after suffering a spin on his first run. He was later fined $5,000 for not placing his car at the pit-lane weighbridge. Häkkinen qualified fourth, three hundredths of a second slower than Fisichella. Häkkinen later admitted that he was <b>cautious</b> <b>about</b> going off the race track due to the weather conditions. de la Rosa qualified fifth giving Arrows their best qualifying performance of the season. Trulli and Wurz were satisfied with their sixth and seventh place qualifying positions. Herbert in the quicker of the two Jaguars took eighth. Villeneuve secured ninth using his team's spare car after spinning on track which disrupted Frentzen's running. Irvine rounded out the top ten. Verstappen had problems starting his engine, resulting in a lack of qualifying laps but managed to clinch eleventh. Zonta qualified twelfth having used a new engine and could not set a faster lap time after being blocked by Jean Alesi. He was ahead of Alesi's teammate Nick Heidfeld. Ralf Schumacher qualified in 14th, quicker than teammate Button in 16th. They were separated by Salo. Frentzen spent the majority of qualifying 107% outside of the pole sitters time but took 17th; his first quick time was disallowed after cutting the chicane to set a faster lap and to run in clean air. Barrichello used his teammate's car after his developed oil-leak issues and qualified 18th. Sauber's Pedro Diniz took 19th, in front of Alesi in 20th. The Minardi drivers qualified {{at the back of the}} grid; Gastón Mazzacane in 21st and Marc Gené in 22nd.|$|E
