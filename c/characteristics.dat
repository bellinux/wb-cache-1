The number of samples in this research were 52 respondents or cencus method. The analysis used the staff’s perception of individual <b>characteristic,</b> job <b>characteristic,</b> organizational <b>characteristic,</b> motivation and job satisfaction using mediated regression.

5|$|Preliminary {{examination}} of the bullet can exclude {{a large number of}} weapons by examining the general <b>characteristics</b> of a recovered bullet. By determining general aspects of the fired ammunition, a number of weapons can be immediately excluded as being incapable of firing that type of bullet. The make and model of the weapon can also be inferred from the combination of different class <b>characteristics</b> that are common to specific manufactures. The three main class <b>characteristics</b> of all bullets are the lands and grooves, the caliber of the bullet, and the rifling twist. All three can be tied directly to the type of barrel that was used to fire the bullet. The lands and grooves of barrel are the bumps and valleys created when the rifling is created. The caliber is the diameter of the barrel. The twist is the direction of the striations left by the barrel's rifling, clockwise (right-handed) or counterclockwise (left-handed). Most barrels will have a right-handed twist with the exception of weapons created by the Colt's Manufacturing Company which uses left-handed twists. Weapon barrels that match the class <b>characteristics</b> of recovered bullets can be examined further for individual <b>characteristics</b> to determine if the bullet came from that particular weapon.|$|E
