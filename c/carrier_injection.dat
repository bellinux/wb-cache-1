25|$|The {{improved}} {{injection of}} carriers {{into the base}} allows the base {{to have a higher}} doping level, resulting in lower resistance to access the base electrode. In the more traditional BJT, also referred to as homojunction BJT, the efficiency of <b>carrier</b> <b>injection</b> from the emitter to the base is primarily determined by the doping ratio between the emitter and base, which means the base must be lightly doped to obtain high injection efficiency, making its resistance relatively high. In addition, higher doping in the base can improve figures of merit like the Early voltage by lessening base narrowing.|$|E
25|$|Heterojunction {{transistors}} {{have different}} semiconductors for {{the elements of}} the transistor. Usually the emitter is composed of a larger bandgap material than the base. The figure shows that this difference in bandgap allows the barrier for holes to inject backward from the base into the emitter, denoted in the figure as Δφp, to be made large, while the barrier for electrons to inject into the base Δφn is made low. This barrier arrangement helps reduce minority <b>carrier</b> <b>injection</b> from the base when the emitter-base junction is under forward bias, and thus reduces base current and increases emitter injection efficiency.|$|E
2500|$|Shockley, {{angered by}} not being {{included}} on the patent applications, secretly continued his own work to build {{a different sort of}} transistor based on junctions instead of point contacts; he expected this kind of design {{would be more likely to}} be commercially viable. The point contact transistor, he believed, would prove to be fragile and difficult to manufacture. Shockley was also dissatisfied with certain parts of the explanation for how the point contact transistor worked and conceived of the possibility of minority <b>carrier</b> <b>injection.</b> On February 13, 1948 another team member, John N. Shive, built a point contact transistor with bronze contacts on the front and back of thin wedge of germanium, proving that holes could diffuse through bulk germanium and not just along the surface as previously thought. Shive's invention sparked Shockley's invention of the junction transistor. A few months later he invented an entirely new, considerably more robust, type of transistor with a layer or 'sandwich' structure. This structure went on to be used for the vast majority of all transistors into the 1960s, and evolved into the bipolar junction transistor. Shockley later admitted that the workings of the team were [...] "mixture of cooperation and competition." [...] He also admitted that he kept some of his own work secret until his [...] "hand was forced" [...] by Shive's 1948 advance. Shockley worked out a rather complete description of what he called the [...] "sandwich" [...] transistor, and a first proof of principle was obtained on April 7, 1949.|$|E

To {{take account of the}} formation of Schottky barriers, we add scalar and vector potentials, which satisfy the Poisson equation with boundary values depending on the drain voltage, the gate bias, and the work-function difference. The current-voltage characteristics are obtained by solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation in the unrestricted Hartree-Fock approximation. Its validity is discussed {{with the help of the}} Lanczos method applied to small systems. We find generally ambipolar <b>carrier</b> <b>injections</b> in Mott insulators even if the work function of the crystal is quite different from that of the electrodes. They result from balancing the correlation effect with the barrier effect. For the gate-bias polarity with higher Schottky barriers, the correlation effect is weakened accordingly, owing to collective transport in the one-dimensional correlated electron systems.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the <b>carrier</b> signal <b>injection</b> based sensorless control of Permanent Magnet (PM) Brushless AC (BLAC) machines. Based on the machine {{saliency}} property, <b>carrier</b> signal <b>injection</b> based sensorless techniques have been well developed in the past decade. In order to provide the insight into machine saliency information, a simplified experimental procedure is presented to obtain the machine saliency distribution in the dq plane, including magnetic saturation and cross-saturation effects. Based on the measured machine saliency information, Sensorless Safety Operation Area (SSOA), which accounts for quantization errors in the Analog to Digital (AD) conversion, is proposed to investigate the effectiveness of sensorless operation for practical applications. The SSOA defines a working area in dq plane, in which the machine can work in sensorless mode with guaranteed steady state performance for either pulsating or rotating <b>carrier</b> signal <b>injection</b> based methods. The non-ideal characteristics of machines and drives introduce additional carrier current disturbances in <b>carrier</b> signal <b>injection</b> based sensorless control, which eventually results in the deterioration of the position estimation accuracy, the degradation of dynamic performance and even stability problems. This thesis investigates the influence of inverter nonlinearity effects on rotating <b>carrier</b> signal <b>injection</b> based methods. With the aid of theoretical analysis and experimental measurement, it is proven that the positive sequence carrier current distortion resulting from inverter nonlinearity effects can be used to compensate the influence of inverter nonlinearity on negative sequence carrier current. Hence, a new online post-compensation scheme is developed in this thesis by utilizing the measured distortion of positive sequence carrier current. In sensorless control, great efforts are required to compensate for nonlinear effects in order to improve the accuracy of the estimated position information. Alternatively, the optimal efficiency of machines, instead of accurate position estimation, can be taken as the sensorless operation objective. In this way, the sensorless operation performance is improved by the proposed online optimal efficiency tracking without any compensation for nonlinear effects. In addition, a robust magnetic polarity identification scheme is developed in this thesis based on d-axis magnetic saturation effect. The proposed scheme can be seamlessly integrated into conventional <b>carrier</b> signal <b>injection</b> based sensorless control algorithm.

This represents gradual Mott transition of an excitonic phase into an electron-hole plasma in a GaInP/AlGaInP laser diode. This is further substantiated by more and more exponentially looking shapes of high energy tails in electroluminescence spectra with increasing forward bias, which originates from a growing non-degenerate population of free electrons and holes.

We have calculated carrier polarization-dependent optical matrix elements using 8 -band strain-dependent k. p theory for InAs/GaAs self-assembled quantum dots (SAQDs) for electron and hole spin injection into a range of quantum dot sizes and shapes, and for arbitrary emission directions. The observed circular polarization does not depend on whether the injected spin-polarized carriers are electrons or holes, but is strongly influenced by the SAQD geometry and emission direction. Calculations for typical SAQD geometries with emission along [110] show light that is only ~ 5 % circularly polarized for spin states that are 100 % polarized along [110]. Therefore observed polarizations [Chye et al. PRB 66, 201301 (R) ] of ~ 1 % imply a spin polarization within the dot of ~ 20 %.
