5|$|A complete, {{tenacious}} {{and consistent}} two-footed player, Nedvěd frequently played as a left-sided, offensive wide midfielder or as a left-winger throughout his career, {{due to his}} <b>crossing</b> <b>ability</b> with his left foot, as well as due to his ability to cut inside and shoot with his right foot, although {{he was capable of}} playing anywhere in midfield due to his offensive and defensive work-rate. He was also deployed as a central midfielder on occasion, as well as in an attacking midfield and playmaking role, or as a supporting striker, where he excelled as an assist-man due to his excellent dribbling ability, passing range and vision. Primarily known for his powerful shots and volleys from distance, as well as his stamina, he was also noted for his speed, endurance, technique and goal-scoring ability. He was also an accurate set-piece and penalty kick taker.|$|E
25|$|A talented player, Conceição {{was mainly}} {{known for his}} speed, strength, and ability to cover the flank and get forward, also {{possessing}} good dribbling skills, <b>crossing</b> <b>ability,</b> and a fairly accurate shot. A versatile and hard-working midfielder, although he was usually deployed as a right winger, he was also capable of playing in a holding role.|$|E
25|$|Milner has {{the ability}} to pass {{accurately}} and shoot from a great distance from goal. As a result, he usually goes forward for set pieces and is often a candidate to take corners and free kicks. Critical opinion is divided as to Milner's <b>crossing</b> <b>ability.</b> While some commentators have been critical of his ability in this area, other journalists have said that Milner can produce accurate crosses.|$|E
50|$|A {{versatile}} player, Mohamed {{is considered}} {{as one of the}} best left-footed players currently playing in the Maldives. He is noted for his pace, as well as his dribbling and <b>crossing</b> <b>abilities.</b>|$|R

25|$|A hard-working, {{versatile}} and technically gifted player, McManaman was usually deployed as a winger, or occasionally {{as a central}} midfielder; his preferred position, however, {{was that of a}} more offensive and creative attacking midfielder, an uncommon position in the Premier League throughout his career. McManaman was a quick, strong, creative, and energetic player, with good dribbling ability, as well as accurate passing and <b>crossing</b> <b>ability</b> with either foot, which allowed him to create chances and provide assists for teammates as a playmaker. He was often criticised, however, for his inability to score many goals, although he would later improve upon this element of his game during his career.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom the 4–4–2 {{formation}} rose {{to prominence}} in the 1960s. The English also developed a tactical formation {{that looked like a}} 4–4–2 (more accurately 4–1–3–2) but switched to 4–2–4 or 4–3–3 depending on how they attacked. The flat back four that had become so popular remained intact, but the midfield was a free-flowing unit with players given license to attack as the scenario saw fit. In defence, using the 1966 World Cup side as an example, Martin Peters, Bobby Charlton and Alan Ball would all stay back to counter the opposition attack. However, in attack they had two options: Peters and Ball could charge forward, creating problems for the opposition out wide with their pace and <b>crossing</b> <b>ability,</b> creating either a 4–2–4 formation or a 3–3–4 formation when one of the full-backs pushed forward; or Charlton could burst through the middle of the strike partnership of Roger Hunt and Geoff Hurst and overload the centre of the opposition defence in a 4–3–3, providing either an extra man in the box or an effective long-shot alternative. The unsung hero of Alf Ramsey's England side was Nobby Stiles, who was the midfield linchpin, whom the team relied on in defence when Charlton surged forward in support of the strikers.|$|E
50|$|Design work by Fosters {{began in}} December 1939 {{producing}} a wooden mock-up. Designed with trench <b>crossing</b> <b>abilities</b> {{to the fore}} and the capability to carry infantry as well, the design as built was a large hull with side doors supported on broad tracks, with a 2-pdr gun armed Matilda II infantry tank turret. The front plate of the hull carried the 75 mm gun and mounting as used on French Char B tank.|$|R
500|$|Michael Carrick (born 28 July 1981) is an English {{professional}} footballer who plays for Manchester United, whom he also captains, and the England national team. Carrick primarily plays {{as a central}} midfielder, {{but he has been}} used as an emergency centre-back under Alex Ferguson, David Moyes and Louis van Gaal. Distinctive features of his play include his inventive distribution of the ball along with his passing and <b>crossing</b> <b>abilities.</b> He {{is one of the most}} decorated English footballers of all time.|$|R
50|$|Designed with trench <b>crossing</b> <b>abilities</b> to {{the fore}} and the {{capability}} to carry infantry as well, the design was a large hull with side doors supported on broad tracks, with a small turret on top. The prototype TOG 1 was delivered in October 1940. After problems with the electro-mechanical drive, it was converted to hydraulic drive, a process that took until May 1943 after which it was called TOG 1A. The prototype was sent to Chobham and then seems to have disappeared into history.|$|R
25|$|Ronaldo is {{regarded}} {{by many in}} the sport {{as one of the greatest}} and most complete forwards of all time. Dubbed Il Fenomeno (the phenomenon), he was a prolific goalscorer, and despite being more of an individualistic attacker, he was also capable of providing assists for his teammates, due to his vision, passing and <b>crossing</b> <b>ability.</b> He was an extremely powerful, fast, and technical player, as well as being a composed finisher. He was capable of playing in several offensive positions, although his preferred role was that of a striker, and he was able to use both feet, despite being naturally right footed. Ronaldo was highly regarded for his technical ability, and he is considered one of the most skilful individual dribblers in the game. Along with Brazilian compatriot Romário and African star George Weah, Ronaldo was seen as a new breed of striker in the 1990s who would also operate outside the penalty area before running with the ball towards goal: Ronaldo was frequently capable of beating several players when undergoing individual dribbling runs at speed, and he was also equally competent in one on one situations, due to his ball control, acceleration, agility, balance, quick feet and technical skills.|$|E

500|$|Neilson is a midfielder, {{who likes}} {{to play on the}} right wing, but has also been used in a more central role. Despite playing in midfield, Neilson has been known for scoring goals. One of his former {{teammates}} Lee Bullock said he was [...] "a winger who looks like he's got some decent skills" [...] while Paul Carden, his assistant manager at Cambridge United, said: [...] "You can see he's an intelligent player and very quick ... he catches the eye because he can go past people and is good with the ball at his feet." [...] Neilson, however, was also told to improve his <b>crossing</b> <b>ability</b> and criticised for his lack of fitness by former manager Peter Taylor.|$|E
2500|$|Beckham is a [...] "product of Sir Alex Ferguson's {{school of}} hard graft" [...] at Manchester United. Renowned for his {{long-range}} passing, <b>crossing</b> <b>ability,</b> and bending free-kicks {{as a right}} winger, Ferguson noted that Beckham [...] "practised with a discipline to achieve an accuracy that other players wouldn't care about."

40|$|During {{the past}} 25 years, {{chilling}} tolerance of the cultivated (chilling-sensitive) tomato Lycopersicon esculentum and its wild, chilling-tolerant relatives L. peruvianum and L. hirsutum (and, less intensively studied, L. chilense) {{has been the}} object of several investigations. The final aim of these studies {{can be seen in}} the increase in chilling tolerance of the cultivated genotypes. In this review, we will focus on low-temperature effects on photosynthesis and the inheritance of these traits to the offspring of various breeding attempts. While crossing L. peruvianum (¿) to L. esculentum (¿) so far has brought the most detailed insight with respect to physiological questions, for practical purposes, e. g., the readily <b>cross</b> <b>ability,</b> <b>crossing</b> programmes with L. hirsutum as pollen donor at present seem to be a promising way to achieve higher chilling-tolerant genotypes of the cultivated tomato. This perspective is due to the progress that has been made with respect to the genetic basis of chilling tolerance of Lycopersicon spp. over the past five year...|$|R

Former Liverpool player and BBC football pundit Mark Lawrenson said [...] "What makes Gareth Bale so special? Simple. He is one of the quickest players I've ever seen, but he has another gear and the ability to find that extra pace within the next stride. He has the ability to perform and use his technique at great pace." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{fatty acid}} {{profiles}} of 145 telial isolates of Puccinia recondita sensu lato (Uredinales: Pucciniaceae), from dif-ferent host species and different geographical origins, {{were determined by}} gas chromatography (GC). The iso-lates clustered into three different GC groups, according to consistent quantitative differences in their fatty acid compositions. Isolates collected from bread, durum and wild emmer wheats, with Thalictrum speciosissimum (Ra-nunculaceae) as aecial host, regardless of their geographi-cal origin, formed one group. The second group consists of isolates collected on Aegilops spp. and some from du-rum wheat, all alternating on Boraginaceous species. The third group contains isolates collected on rye, alternating on Boraginaceae. The grouping of P. recondita isolates by fatty acid profiles coincides with a similar one, suggested by several studies involving pathogenicity on alternate hosts, <b>cross</b> <b>ability,</b> teliospore dimensions and relative DNA content of haploid spores. It is concluded that the three groups represent two species and one subspecies: Puccinia triticina (on wheats, group 1), P. recondita sub-sp. recondita (on rye, group 3) and P. recondita subsp. aegilopis (on Aegilops spp. and durum wheat, group 2) ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{production}} of 450 vehicles {{had been ordered}} even before the prototype was finished and this number was now increased to 700, to be manufactured at North British Locomotive in Glasgow and later at Metropolitan, Coventry Ordnance Works and the Patent Shaft and Axletree Company. Confusingly the new tank {{was to have the}} same name as the Mark A: [...] "Whippet". Almost immediately after having been taken into use, the type fell from grace for two reasons. Firstly the engine compartment couldn't be easily accessed from the fighting compartment. Repair under fire would therefore have been very dangerous. Secondly Tritton had constructed a rival type: the Medium Mark C [...] "Hornet". This other design had superior speed and trench <b>crossing</b> <b>abilities.</b> Wilson had limited the size of the Mark B to that of a single railway flatcar. The end of the war led to cancellation after 102 were produced out of the first order for 450. Of these only 45 were taken into service by the British Army, the remaining 57 probably going straight to the scrapyard.|$|R
5000|$|Branch's {{contract}} {{was set to}} expire {{at the end of}} the 2004-05 season before he earned a one-year extension in April 2005. [...] The 2005-06 season held even more promise for the player after his hard work and commitment paid off after he was offered a new one-year extension to his current deal. [...] Although he only scored two goals he played a large role in many victories due to his skill and <b>crossing</b> <b>abilities.</b> The 2006-07 was widely expected to be his last with Burnley and he spent it as a little-used substitute or squad player. However, the season was dedicated as an entire testimonial season for him, culminating on 7 May 2007, when 1,809 fans turned out at Turf Moor to say goodbye to him. In his testimonial, the current Burnley side played a 'Branch XI'. Although no official announcement had been made by that stage, Branch's departure had been confirmed by Steve Cotterill in interviews leading up to this testimonial match. His departure was confirmed on 8 May 2007.|$|R
