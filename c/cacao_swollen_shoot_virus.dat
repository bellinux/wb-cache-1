This study characterised {{the current status}} of the disease in the major cacao growing States in Nigeria and attempted a clarification on the manner of CSSV transmission. Two separate field surveys and sample collections were conducted in Nigeria in summer 2012 and spring 2013. PCR-based screening of cacao leaf samples and subsequent DNA sequencing showed that the disease continues to persist in Ondo and Oyo States and in new cacao sites in Abia, Akwa Ibom, Cross River and Edo States. Mealybug samples collected were identified using a robust approach involving environmental scanning electron microscopy, histology and DNA barcoding, which highlighted the importance of integrative taxonomy in the study. The results show that the genus Planococcus (Planococcus citri (Risso) and/or Planococcus minor (Maskell)) was the most abundant vector (73. 5 %) at the sites examined followed by Formicococcus njalensis (Laing) (19. 0 %). In a laboratory study, the feeding behaviour of Pl. citri, Pseudococcus longispinus (Targioni-Tozzetti) and Pseudococcus viburni (Signoret) on cacao were investigated using electrical penetration graph (EPG) analysis. EPG waveforms reflecting intercellular stylet penetration (C), extracellular salivation (E 1 e), salivation in sieve elements (E 1), phloem ingestion (E 2), derailed stylet mechanics (F), xylem ingestion (G) and non-probing phase (Np) were analysed. Individual mealybugs exhibited marked variation within species and significantly differed (p ≤. 05) between species for E 1 e and E 1. PCR-based assessments of the retention time for CSSV in viruliferous Pl. citri, Ps. longispinus and Ps. viburni fed on a non-cacao diet showed that CSSV was still detectable after 144 hours. These unusually long durations for a pathogen currently classified as a semi-persistent virus have implications for the design of non-malvaceous barrier crops currently being considered for the protection of new cacao plantings...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cacao</b> <b>swollen</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>virus</b> (CSSV) is {{the only}} virus disease of cacao that is {{prevalent}} and damaging. CSSV is a dsDNA virus of the genus Badnavirus and the family Caulimoviridae transmitted by several species of mealybugs. The historical emergence of the disease is {{closely associated with the}} establishment of cacao cultivation in West Africa as it appeared soon after the introduction of the cacao in West Africa and remains endemic to this area. The disease is likely due to several host shifts from indigenous hosts.

Although the disease spreads slowly, eradication campaigns have failed to contain the disease which continues to emerge in new West African regions. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe open {{reading frame}} (ORF) III product (PIII) of the pararetrovirus {{cauliflower}} mosaic virus (CaMV) has nucleic acid-binding propertiesin vitro,but its biological role is not yet determined. ORF III is closely linked to ORF II and overlaps ORF IV out of frame in the CaMV genome. A new CaMV-derived vector (CaΔ) devoid of ORF III and containing unique restriction sites between ORFs II and IV was designed. Introduction of the wild-type CaMV ORF III into CaΔ results in a clone (Ca 3) infectious in turnip plants. Truncated or point-mutated versions of ORF III were then inserted into CaΔ and testedin vivo. Inoculation of the different mutants into turnip revealed that the four C-terminal amino acid residues of PIII are dispensable for infectivity {{as well as an}} internal domain (amino acids 61 to 80). Taken together the results show that PIII possesses a functional two-domain organization. Moreover, the CaMV PIII function(s) cannot be replaced either by the PIII protein of another caulimovirus, the figwort mosaic virus, or by the P 2 protein of the <b>cacao</b> <b>swollen</b> <b>shoot</b> badnavirus, a member of the second plant pararetrovirus group...|$|R

We have looked for such a binding capacity of rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV) ORF 2 product. For this purpose, the protein was expressed as full-length or truncated versions inEscherichia coli. When used in nucleic acid-binding assays, complete RTBV P 2 was shown to bind both DNA and RNA. This property may be related to a basic sequence, PPKKGIKRKYPA, localized at its C-terminus. Mutations were introduced into this sequence and revealed that four of the five basic residues, including a crucial lysine, are required for the binding to nucleic acids.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Mealybugs (Hemiptera: Coccoidea: Pseudococcidae) are key vectors of badnaviruses, {{including}} <b>Cacao</b> <b>Swollen</b> <b>Shoot</b> <b>Virus</b> (CSSV) {{the most}} damaging virus affecting cacao (Theobroma cacao L.). The effectiveness of mealybugs as virus vectors is species dependent and it is therefore vital that CSSV resistance breeding programmes in cacao incorporate accurate mealybug identification. In this work the efficacy of a CO 1 -based DNA barcoding approach to species identification was evaluated by screening a range of mealybugs collected from cacao in seven countries. RESULTS: Morphologically similar adult females were characterised by scanning electron microscopy and then, following DNA extraction, were screened with CO 1 barcoding markers. A high degree of CO 1 sequence homology was observed for all 11 individual haplotypes including those accessions from distinct geographical regions. This has allowed {{for the design of}} a High Resolution Melt (HRM) assay capable of rapid identification of the commonly encountered mealybug pests of cacao. CONCLUSIONS: HRM Analysis (HRMA) readily differentiated between mealybug pests of cacao that can not necessarily be identified by conventional morphological analysis. This new approach, therefore, has potential to facilitate breeding for resistance to CSSV and other mealybug transmitted diseases...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cacao</b> <b>swollen</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>virus</b> (CSSV) {{is a major}} {{pathogen}} of cacao (Theobroma cacao) in Africa, and long-standing {{efforts to}} limit its spread by culling infected trees have had very limited success.

Furthermore, the virus is not mechanically transmissible, and its insect vector can only be used with difficulty. Thus, the only efficient means to infect cacao plants that has been experimentally described so far are by particle bombardment or agroinoculation of cacao plants with an infectious clone. We have genetically transformed three non-host species with an infectious form of the CSSV genome: two experimental hosts widely used in plant virology (Nicotiana tabacum and N. benthamiana) and the model species Arabidopsis thaliana. In transformed plants of all three species, the CSSV genome was able to replicate, and in tobacco, CSSV particles could be observed by immunosorbent electron microscopy, demonstrating that the complete virus cycle could be completed in a non-host plant.

The re-emergence of the disease occurred in patches or foci: following analyses with the two statistical methods, diseased trees and dead trees {{were found to be}} clearly aggregated on the three observed plots for the 2 years. The observed progress of the disease was not the same on the three plots and seemed dependent on the disease state of the first year: the higher the attack rate of the first year, the faster the disease progression.

40|$|<b>Cacao</b> <b>swollen</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>virus</b> (CSSV) {{is a major}} {{pathogen}} {{that has}} seriously constrained cocoa production in West Africa, particularly Ghana and Nigeria. To date, cordon sanitaire control measures in Ghana have failed {{to prevent the spread}} of the condition caused by the virus, <b>Cacao</b> <b>swollen</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>virus</b> disease (CSSVD). The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of cocoa somatic embryogenesis to produce virus-free clonal propagation material both for replanting and to facilitate the safe international exchange of germplasm. CSSVD detection in the field is hampered by the sometimes slow appearance of visual symptoms and their complete absence in mild strains. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) -based screening, a sensitive tool for microbial pathogen identification, is employed in this study because of its capacity for CSSV detection prior to the appearance of visual symptoms. Degenerate PCR primers were developed in order to improve the CSSV-strain dependence of earlier tests. Accordingly it was found that these primers (comprising a mixture of 48 variable redundant nucleotide bases) were capable of detecting 37 out of a putative 56 CSSV strains maintained at the Cocoa Research Institute of Ghana, four more than the sequence specific primers. For tissue culture studies, cocoa staminodes cultures were established from flowers of CSSV-infected cocoa genotypes CL 19 / 10 strain 1 A and Amelonado Plant 2 to produce callus, primary and secondary somatic embryos, with genotype AMAZ 15 from the Intermediate Cocoa Quarantine Facility used as a virus-free control. In terms of primary somatic embryo production tested across five cocoa genotypes the Nestle protocol proved to be more efficient than the Penn State protocol, although the distinction was less clear with virus-infected donor trees. PCR- based CSSV detection proved that virus could be detected at callus, primary somatic embryos and secondary somatic embryo stages, although the frequency of CSSV was reduced, indicating that the progress of the virus was progressively impeded. Assessment on the presence of plasmodesmata within CSSV-infected cocoa tissues by using transmission electron microscopy was hampered with the presence of artefacts in all sections mounted on Formvar films. Plasmodesmata were not detected may be indicative of a low frequency of plasmodesmata and may also be due to the techniques and methods used. Trials were conducted to assess Nicotiana benthamiana plantlets as alternate CSSV indicators and while they did receive viral DNA this was at too Iowa frequency to make them a viable option for glasshouse- based viral screening. The overall findings of this work do, however, support the use of somatic embryogenesis as a means of improving CSSV-free clonal propagation of cocoa.

The CSSV groups in Ghana are very divergent and correspond to at least five different putative species, according to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses recommendations (A, B-C complex, G, E, and M), with the M species only being detected in the alternate host Ceiba pentandra.

40|$|The need to {{conserve}} biodiversity of cocoa has become paramount {{due to the}} action {{of a range of}} diseases, pests and environmental hazards. In 1983 bushfire destroyed 60, 000 ha of cocoa plantation in Ghana and as of 1982 185. 5 million trees have been cut down in Eastern region of Ghana alone due to <b>Cacao</b> <b>Swollen</b> <b>Shoot</b> <b>Virus</b> (CSSV) infection. In order to safeguard germplasm of cocoa there is the need to use in vitro-based techniques to support in situ conservation. Successful cryopreservation of cocoa has already been demonstrated using an encapsulation-dehydration method but this is a labour intensive protocol requiring a relatively high level of technical skill and the objective of the current work is to explore the efficacy of a vitrification-based approach. Floral-derived secondary somatic embryos (SSE) of cocoa genotype AMAZ 15 were utilised. In order to optimise the vitrification procedure the effect of preculturing SSEs on sucrose and dehydration with plant vitrification solution 2 (PVS 2) was studied. SSEs were precultured on embryo development (ED) medium supplemented with either 0. 5 or 0. 75 M sucrose for 3 or 5 d and dehydrated with cold PVS 2 for 45 - 105 rin before storage in liquid nitrogen (LN). Preculturing the embryos on 0. 5 M sucrose for 5 d and dehydrating them in PVS 2 for 60 min led to significantly higher post-cryo survival than any other treatment (74. 5 ± 6. 4 %). So as to minimise cryo-injury due to cation- induced free radical formation, nutrient cation sources were removed from the ED solution and/or the recovery medium (ED), the former treatment resulting in a significant benefit. The influence of size of cotyledonary stage SSEs on postcryo' survival was studied for two size ranges. SSEs between 2 - 3 mm survived better than those between 4 - 5 mm. The protocol was effective across five other genotypes so far tested without further procedural variation. In order to accelerate bulking up of clones, embryos regenerated following cryopreservation were used as explant sources and the freezing process was not found to have any inhibitory effect on their embryogenic potential. In order to optimise the dehydration process Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was used to examine SSEs during cooling and warming. Partial vitrification, as evidenced by glass transition and ice melting, was achieved when embryos were exposed to PVS 2 for 45 and 60 min which correlated with higher post- cryo survival. Application of somatic embryogenesis and cryopreservation to eradicate <b>Cacao</b> <b>Swollen</b> <b>Shoot</b> <b>Virus</b> (CSSV) was also studied.

30|$|According to Dormon et al. (2004), the {{incidence}} of insect pests and diseases is a major challenge in cocoa production in Ghana and has resulted in low yields due to inadequate management. Duguma et al. (1998), Lass (2004) and Dormon et al. (2007) estimate losses by insect pests and diseases to be 30  % of global yields of cocoa annually, whereas site-specific losses ranging from 10 to 80  % annually have been reported. In Ghana, the mirids (capsids) and the black pod disease are the most destructive {{of the number of}} insect pests and diseases which attack the developing cocoa tree and the development or ripening of cocoa pod. Farmers in the study area identified mirids as the major insect pest. Other insect pests of cocoa mentioned included termites, mealy bugs, ants, mites, shield bugs, stem borers, and pod borers. This confirms the fact that marids remain the insect pest of economic importance in Ghana (Antwi-Agyakwa 2013). The major cocoa disease mentioned by farmers was the black pod followed by the cocoa <b>swollen</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>virus.</b> Mistletoe a parasitic plant and rodents were also mentioned by some farmers to cause decline in cocoa production in the study area. According to the farmers, capsid and black pod attacks were the major causes of pre-harvest losses in their cocoa farms (65 and 45  % of the respondents respectively). On the other hand, 17  % of the respondents reported that rodents were among the pests of cocoa causing pre-harvest losses and this could be attributed to poor maintenance of farms.

Pollen was harvested from CSSV infected cocoa trees and used to cross-pollinate flowers of healthy cocoa trees (recipient parents) to generate enough cocoa seeds for the PCR screening. Adequate precautions were taken to avoid cross-contamination during duplicated DNA extractions and only PCR results accompanied by effective positive and negative controls were scored. Results from the PCR analyses showed that samples of cocoa pod husk, mesocarp and seed tissues (testa, cotyledon and embryo) from the cross-pollinations were PCR negative for CSSV DNA. Sequential DNA samples from new leaves of seedlings resulting from the cross-pollinated trees were consistently PCR negative for presence of portions of CSSV DNA for over 36 months after germination. A reverse transcription-PCR analysis performed on the seedlings showed negative results, indicating absence of functional CSSV RNA transcripts in the seedlings. None of the seedlings exhibited symptoms characteristic of the CSSV disease, and all infectivity tests on the seedlings were also negative. Following these results, the study concluded that although CSSV DNA was detected in pollen from CSSV infected trees, {{there was no evidence}} of pollen transmission of the virus through cross-pollination from infected cocoa parents to healthy cocoa trees.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} Ghana’s cocoa {{industry from}} the innovation systems perspective. Cocoa {{is the major}} cash crop of Ghana. Its importance is {{not only in the}} contribution of about 25 % annually of the total foreign exchange earnings but also on account of being the source of livelihoods for many rural farmers and the related actors in the value chain. The critical actors in the innovation system are the farmers, the researchers, the buyers, the transporters, public officers, consumers and the policy makers. By the roles and functions they perform, they impact on the dynamics of the cocoa industry. The paper describes the trends in cocoa production and processing and highlights the key characteristics and implications. It discusses the policy reforms in the cocoa industry and the major drivers of the reforms. The Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) {{is one of the biggest}} public institutions in Ghana and its subsidiaries are major actors in the production process of cocoa for export. The key reforms in the policies governing the industry were the dissolution of the monopoly of Produce Buying Company and the deregulation of cocoa purchasing to allow Licensed Buying Companies (LBCs) to enter the business in 1992 / 93 crop season. There was also the dismantling and re-organization of the Cocoa Services Division into two separate units—the Cocoa <b>Swollen</b> <b>Shoot</b> <b>Virus</b> Disease Control Unit (CSSVDCU) and the Seed Production Unit (SPU). The processing of cocoa into cocoa butter, cocoa paste and confectioneries is an important component of the value chain especially with the national goal of processing 50 % of cocoa before export. The paper discusses policy implementation in the cocoa industry underscoring the successes and failures. It highlights lessons for other primary commodity producing countries especially those whose development contexts are similar to Ghana’s...|$|R
40|$|Cocoa <b>Swollen</b> <b>Shoot</b> <b>Virus</b> Disease (CSSVD) {{is one of}} {{the major}} factors {{limiting}} cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) productivity in West Africa. The only cure for CSSVD is to cut out visibly infected trees and the official eradication campaign in Ghana has cut out more than 200 million trees since 1946. 80 years of research on preventive control measures have mainly focused on resistance breeding, mild strain cross-protection (inoculation of cocoa seedlings with a mild strain of the virus to protect against the severe strain) and control of mealybug vectors. Meanwhile, diversification measures such as agroforestry (for shading) or barrier (strip) cropping have received less attention. Despite promising results, CSSVD is more prevalent in the field than ever before. The large body of knowledge on preventive control measures for CSSVD is fragmented and many publications are not easily accessible. Furthermore, the literature has never been systematically evaluated and quantitatively assessed. Hence, we consolidated this knowledge with an extensive literature review followed by meta-analysis to identify the pertinent research gaps. Out of 423 publications on CSSVD-related issues, we selected 34 studies, which contained 52 datasets on seven different preventive control measures. Results showed that resistance breeding and mild strain crossprotection may reduce CSSVD infection by 30 percent, while the potential of diversification measures (shading/agroforestry and barrier (strip) cropping) seems to be considerably higher (40 and 85 percent, respectively). However, there is a lack of evidence because of a low number of studies about diversification measures, indicating that our results have to be interpreted with care and calling for more research in this area. Future testing is needed to evaluate the efficacy of barrier (strip) cropping to reduce CSSVD, and address the effect of shade on CSSVD symptom severity. Furthermore, the practical relevance of different preventive control measures for farmers needs to be assessed, and shade should be considered in current breeding programs for CSSVD resistance...|$|R
40|$|Cocoa <b>swollen</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>virus</b> disease (CSSVD) seriously affects cocoa {{production}} in Ghana, {{particularly in the}} areas of mass infection (AMI) in the Eastern Region whilst the disease continues spreading to areas with scatter outbreaks especially in the Western Region. Reports utilising visible diagnostic symptoms on whether the virus is seed-borne and transmissible to seedlings of cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) have been conflicting. Studies show that visible viral symptoms are not always manifested on all affected parts of infected cocoa trees due to a period of CSSV latency. In this work, molecular diagnostic techniques involving DNA and RNA based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods were utilised with CSSV primers designed from conserved regions of published CSSV sequences to investigate whether CSSV is sexually transmissible from infected parents to developing seeds and seedlings through a series of pollination experiments. The study also evaluated whether pollen could be a source of CSSV infection into seeds and seedlings through cross pollination experiments by using pollen from CSSV infected cocoa trees onto healthy recipients. Robust precautions were taken to avoid cross contamination during duplicated DNA extractions and only those PCR results accompanied by effective positive and negative controls (from CSSV symptomatic and quarantine assured CSSV free trees respectively) were scored. Following DNA extraction all pods obtained from the self pollination experiments involving CSSV infected cocoa trees were found to contain seeds that were PCR positive for CSSV DNA. The pith (mesocarp) of each of the self pollination generated pods was similarly PCR positive for CSSV DNA, though not all seeds from the pods were positive for the PCR screening. Seed components showed diminishing frequencies of CSSV DNA presence in the order: testa> cotyledon> embryo. Sequential DNA samples from new leaves of some of the seedlings derived from the self-pollinated trees are consistently PCR positive for CSSV DNA over 24 months after germination. Nonetheless, a reverse transcription (RT) PCR screening test has been negative for all those PCR positive seedlings indicating absence of CSSV RNA transcripts in the seedlings. None of the seedlings have exhibited symptoms characteristic of CSSV and infectivity tests on them have been negative. Seeds and seedlings from the cross pollination experiments have also been negative for the PCR analysis implying that pollen could not to be a potential route for CSSV infection. Possible explanations for these events including viral DNA integration into the cocoa genome and possible methylation-directed inactivation of the CSSV DNA are discussed.

40|$|The cytopathological and {{molecular}} studies of <b>cacao</b> <b>swollen</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>virus</b> (CSSV) infected cocoa plants, which {{was aimed at}} identifying structural and functional changes associated with CSSV infections {{that can be used}} as resistant markers has yielded interesting results. Nucleic-acid-rich spherical inclusion bodies, modified plastids, invagination of cell walls, apoptotic cells, massive deposition of phenolic substances in infected cells, in situ localisation of CSSV particles in novel cocoa tissues and the apparent aggregation of starch granules in infected tissues were changes that were found to be accompanying CSSV infection by microscopy. Since most of these discoveries were new in CSSV research, they were validated using PCR (conventional and quantitative (qPCRÃ‚Â», flow cytomefry (FCM) and laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM). The qPCR assay, which was developed from the scratch to measure the CSSV content in infected cocoa plants, has since been used to start building profiles of CSSV resistant cocoa cultivars from Ghana. It was also used toÃ‚Â· compare the viral load between the cotyledons and leaves of an infected cocoa plant, whereby the cotyledons were found to have 4 -folds more CSSV than the leaves. The qPCR assay has also been used to start studying the movement of CSSV in infected cocoa plants. The FCM was used to confirm apoptotic outcome in CSSV infected plants. This was shown by a reduction in total nuclei DNA between infected and healthy plants at magnitudes which correspond to the microscopic observations. Results from the LSCM were inconclusive. Light microscopic analysis of nucleicacid- rich inclusion bodies, which would have added to building a more robust profile ofthe CSSV resistant cocoa cultivars from Ghana could not be completed due to time constraints. The significance of all these findings in breeding ~or CSSV resistant cocoa, and in CSSV research is discussed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Cacao</b> <b>swollen</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>virus</b> (CSSV), Cacao swollen shoot CD virus (CSSCDV), and Cacao swollen shoot Togo A virus (CSSTAV) cause {{cacao swollen shoot}} disease (CSSD) in West Africa. During 2000 - 2003, {{leaf and}} shoot-swelling {{symptoms}} and rapid tree death were observed in cacao in Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana. Molecular tests showed positive infection in only similar to 50 - 60 % of symptomatic trees, suggesting the possible emergence of an unknown badnavirus. Methods: The DNA virome was determined from symptomatic cacao samples using Illumina-Hi Seq, and sequence accuracy was verified by Sanger sequencing. The resultant 14, and seven previously known, full-length badnaviral genomic and RT-RNase H sequences were analyzed by pairwise distance analysis to resolve species relationships, and by Maximum likelihood (ML) to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships. The viral coding and non-coding sequences, genome organization, and predicted conserved protein domains (CPDs) were identified and characterized at the species level. Results: The 21 CSSD-badnaviral genomes and RT-RNase H sequences shared 70 - 100 % and 72 - 100 % identity, respectively. The RT-RNase H analysis predicted four species, based on an >= 80 % species cutoff. The ML genome sequence tree resolved three well-supported clades, with >= 70 % bootstrap, whereas, the RT-RNase H phylogeny was poorly resolved, however, both trees grouped CSSD isolates within one large clade, including the newly discovered Cacao red vein virus (CRVV) proposed species. The genome arrangement of the four species consists of four, five, or six predicted open reading frames (ORFs), and the CPDs have similar architectures. By comparison, two New World cacao-infecting badnaviruses encode four ORFs, and harbor CPDs like the West African species. Conclusions: Three previously recognized West African cacao-infecting badnaviral species were identified, and a fourth, previously unidentified species, CRVV, is described for the first time. The CRVV is a suspect causal agent of the rapid decline phenotype, however Koch's Postulates have not been proven. To reconcile viral evolutionary with epidemiology considerations, more detailed information about CSSD-genomic variability is essential. Also, the functional basis for the multiple genome arrangements and subtly distinct CPD architectures among cacao-infecting badnaviruses is poorly understood. New knowledge about functional relationships may help explain the diverse symptomatologies observed in affected cacao trees...|$|E
40|$|The {{cacao swollen shoot}} {{disease of}} Theobroma cacao L. (cacao) is caused by <b>Cacao</b> <b>swollen</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>virus</b> (CSSV; genus, Badnavirus, family, Caulimoviridae). The virus is endemic to West Africa, where it poses {{a serious threat to}} cocoa production. Despite efforts to control CSSV spread by {{replacement}} of infected trees with tolerant cultivars and mealybug vector management, the disease is widespread in West Africa. In Trinidad, leaf mosaic and vein-banding symptoms have been observed in cacao plants in the field since the 1940 s, and recently at the International Cocoa Genebank (ICGT), a custodian of cacao germplasm resources. The strains A and B of the suspect Cacao Trinidad virus (CTV) caused the symptoms, and were thought to be related to CSSV, however, viral causality was not demonstrated, until now. To develop molecular detection methods for CSSV in infected plants, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of eight regions of the CSSV genome was implemented. The PCR results showed variable amplification frequencies of 19 - 42 % at each region, for 124 isolates collected in Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana. Pairwise nucleotide (nt) analyses of the eight regions showed 66 - 99 % shared identities, indicating that CSSV isolates exhibit extensive variability with respect to primer design. The results provided preliminary evidence for the existence of a CSSV complex consisting of four divergent species. The full length genome of 14 CSSV isolates from cacao determined using the Illumina HiSeq platform showed 70 - 99 % shared nt identities. The pairwise nt identities placed CSSV sequences into a group of four distinct species, one of which represented a previously undescribed species. Moreover, the full-length genomes grouped phylogenetically with other badnaviruses and revealed two CSSV subclades with three types of genome arrangements; four, five or six open reading frames (ORFs). Predicted functional protein domains were conserved on each ORF. Two distinct, full-length genome sequences were determined using the Illumina HiSeq platform, from DNA isolated from cacao leaves exhibiting distinct symptoms in Trinidad. The sequences were validated by PCR-amplification and sequencing of overlapping viral genome fragments. Pairwise nt analysis indicated that each genome shared 52 - 62 % nt identities with CSSV and other badnaviruses, suggesting that the two are distinct species. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the two sequences are not strains of the same virus, as supposed, but they represent two previously undescribed species in the genus, Badnavirus, and they have been named Cacao mild mosaic virus (CaMMV) and Cacao yellow-vein-banding virus (CYVBV). Despite sharing the same host and causing similar symptoms in cacao, CSSV, CaMMV, and CYVBV are phylogenetically-distinct species. The discovery of a CSSV species complex and the identification of three new cacao-infecting badnavirus species will support the development of molecular detection tools using the partial and complete genome sequences determined in this study. The ability to develop validated molecular tools for the detection of CSSV and related viruses, CaMMV and CYVBV, in cacao will aid quarantine efforts and safe movement of germplasm from the ICGT in Trinidad to cacao-growing countries, worldwide. Also, molecular diagnostics tools are expected to be useful in efforts underway to develop CSSV-resistant planting material for countries in West Africa, which are currently experiencing continued or new disease outbreaks...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Tomato is an {{important}} vegetable crop cultivated through out India and leaf curl disease is the major constraint for production. The disease has previously {{been shown to be}} associated with begomoviruses and betasatellites. A distinct monopartite begomovirus was found associated with tomato plants showing sever leaf curl, interveinal chlorosis and stunting symptoms in polyhouse grown tomatoes in Pantnagar, Uttarakhand, India. The complete DNA-A component was amplified through rolling circle amplification (RCA) using Phi 29 DNA polymerase and characterized. The DNA-A of the four isolates as comprised of 2, 758 nucleotides, encoding six open reading frames (ORFs) with genome organization typical of an old world monopartite begomovirus. The begomovirus showed highest sequence identity of (89. 3 to 95. 8 %) to tobacco curly <b>shoot</b> <b>virus</b> (TbCSV) and some other begomoviruses (59. 6 to 88. 1 %) reported from India in tomato. Based on sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis these isolates are strains of tobacco curly <b>shoot</b> <b>virus.</b> Recombinant analysis of the four isolates revealed that some of the isolates are recombinants of Ageratum enation virus (AEV) and tobacco curly <b>shoot</b> <b>virus</b> isolates. This is new begomovirus infecting tomato in addition to the known 16 begomoviruses occurring in India. Information on the distribution and prevalence of the different begomovirus species and recombinant forms comprising the disease complex is crucial in guiding tomato breeding programs in the search for stable and durable sources of resistance...|$|R
