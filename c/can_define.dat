5|$|Burst {{time offset}} (BTO) – the time {{difference}} between when a signal is sent from the ground station and when the response is received. This measure is proportional to twice {{the distance from the}} ground station via the satellite to the aircraft and includes the time that the SDU takes between receiving and responding to the message and time between reception and processing at the ground station. This measure can be analysed to determine the distance between the satellite and the aircraft. As a result, one <b>can</b> <b>define</b> a circle on the Earth's surface the points on whose circumference are equidistant from the satellite at the calculated distance, and in turn this circle can be reduced to arcs by eliminating parts of the circle that are outside the aircraft's range.|$|E

5|$|In the AdS/CFT correspondence, the {{geometry}} of spacetime is {{described in terms of}} a certain vacuum solution of Einstein's equation called anti-de Sitter space. In very elementary terms, anti-de Sitter space is a mathematical model of spacetime in which the notion of distance between points (the metric) is different from the notion of distance in ordinary Euclidean geometry. It is closely related to hyperbolic space, which {{can be viewed as a}} disk as illustrated on the left. This image shows a tessellation of a disk by triangles and squares. One <b>can</b> <b>define</b> the distance between points of this disk in such a way that all the triangles and squares are the same size and the circular outer boundary is infinitely far from any point in the interior.|$|E

5|$|In meteorology, {{winds are}} often {{referred}} to according to their strength, and the direction from which the wind is blowing. Short bursts of high speed wind are termed gusts. Strong winds of intermediate duration (around one minute) are termed squalls. Long-duration winds have various names associated with their average strength, such as , gale, storm, and hurricane. Wind occurs {{on a range of}} scales, from thunderstorm flows lasting tens of minutes, to local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting a few hours, to global winds resulting from the difference in absorption of solar energy between the climate zones on Earth. The two main causes of large-scale atmospheric circulation are the differential heating between the equator and the poles, and the rotation of the planet (Coriolis effect). Within the tropics, thermal low circulations over terrain and high plateaus can drive monsoon circulations. In coastal areas the sea breeze/land breeze cycle <b>can</b> <b>define</b> local winds; in areas that have variable terrain, mountain and valley breezes can dominate local winds.|$|E
