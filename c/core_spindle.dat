40|$|The spindle {{checkpoint}} ensures genome fidelity by temporarily halting {{chromosome segregation}} {{and the ensuing}} mitotic exit until the last kinetochore is productively attached to the mitotic spindle. At the interface between proper chromosome attachment and the metaphase-to-anaphase transition are the mammalian spindle checkpoint kinases. Compelling evidence indicates that the checkpoint kinases Bub 1 and BubR 1 have the added task of regulating kinetochore-microtubule attachments. However, {{the debate on the}} requirement of kinase activity is in full swing. This minireview summarizes recent advances in our understanding of the <b>core</b> <b>spindle</b> checkpoint kinases Bub 1 and BubR 1 and considers evidence that supports and opposes the role of kinase activity in regulating their functions during mitosis...|$|E
40|$|Every mitosis, {{replicated}} chromosomes must be accurately segregated {{into each}} daughter cell. Pairs of sister chromatids {{attach to the}} bipolar mitotic spindle during prometaphase, they are aligned at metaphase, then sisters separate and are pulled to opposite poles during anaphase. Failure to attach correctly to the spindle before anaphase onset results in unequal segregation of chromosomes, {{which can lead to}} cell death or disease. The spindle checkpoint is a surveillance mechanism that delays anaphase onset until all chromosomes are correctly attached in a bipolar fashion to the mitotic spindle. The <b>core</b> <b>spindle</b> checkpoint proteins are Mad 1, Mad 2, BubR 1 (Mad 3 in yeast), Bub 1, Bub 3 and Mps 1. The Mad and Bub proteins were first identified in budding yeast by genetic screens for mutants that failed to arrest in mitosis when the spindle was destroyed (Taylor et al., 2004). These proteins are conserved in all eukaryotes. Several other checkpoint components, such as Rod, Zw 10 and CENP-E, have since been identified in higher eukaryotes but have no yeast orthologues (Karess, 2005; Mao et al., 2003). This reflects a more complex checkpoint regulation in higher eukaryotes where, unlike in yeasts, checkpoint proteins are essential and regulate normal mitotic timing (Meraldi et al., 2004; Taylor et al., 2004). Here, we highlight current understanding of how the spindle checkpoint is activated, how it delays anaphase onset, and how it is silenced. Activation of the checkpoint During mitosis spindle microtubules bind to complex protein structures called kinetochores, which assemble on the centromere of each chromosome. The Mad and Bub proteins localise to the outer kinetochore early in mitosis, before proper attachments are established, and accumulate on unattached kinetochores. When spindle microtubules make contact with the outer kinetochore a number of complex molecular interactions take place that regulate both attachment and microtubule dynamics (Maiato et al., 2004). The checkpoint proteins are therefore ideally placed to monitor these interactions...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{neurodegenerative}} {{diseases are}} pathologically characterized by idiosyncratic protein amyloid inclusions. Not surprisingly amyloid fibrils {{have long been}} proposed to be the toxic protein species in these neurodegenerative diseases. However, more recent work has begun {{to suggest that the}} formation of ordered inclusions serves a protective role and that soluble oligomers on pathway to amyloid formation cause neuronal death. In that regard, ordered protein inclusions, such as aggresomes, have also been shown to facilitate the asymmetric inheritance of protein damage during the mitoses of cells ranging from E. coli to human stem cells. Yeast prion proteins are another group of proteins capable of adapting an amyloid conformation. The self-templating amyloid fold allows yeast prions to act as non-Mendelian elements of inheritance. We have shown that yeast prion amyloid fibrils, especially upon prion protein overexpression, localize to the IPOD (insoluble protein deposit), an ordered inclusion proximal to the vacuole, and {{that the majority of the}} prion amyloid is asymmetrically inherited upon cell division. I used the yeast prion Rnq 1 to investigate how amyloid formation contributes to proteotoxicity. Ectopic overexpression of Rnq 1 was extremely toxic, but only if the endogenous Rnq 1 protein had adopted its amyloid conformation. The Hsp 40 co-chaperone Sis 1 was able to counteract the Rnq 1 -induced toxicity when co-overexpressed. In collaboration with Doug Cyr's lab I showed that Sis 1 -mediated amyloid formation was cytoprotective and that disordered non-amyloid aggregates induced toxicity. These results provide evidence that the formation of ordered inclusions can be cytoprotective. I further characterized Rnq 1 toxicity, conducted two genome-ide screens for modifiers and found that Rnq 1 induced a G 2 /M cell cycle arrest. Rnq 1 overexpression resulted in the mislocalization of the <b>core</b> <b>spindle</b> pole body component Spc 42 to the IPOD and an unduplicated spindle pole body. In mammalian cells aggresomes localize to centrosomes, the mammalian equivalent of the yeast spindle pole body. The finding that a yeast prion can interact with a spindle pole body component represents a new connection between the IPOD and aggresomes. Lastly, I studied a yeast model of A[beta] 1 - 42 toxicity. Accumulation of the amyloid beta peptide is thought to be causal in both sporadic and familial Alzheimer's disease. In collaboration with Kent Matlack I developed a yeast model that expressed A[beta] 1 - 42 in a manner recapitulating mammalian A[beta] 1 - 42 generation and that was amenable to screens for genetic modifiers of A[beta] 1 - 42 toxicity. The screen identified the yeast homolog of PICALM, a known Alzheimer's disease risk factor. I showed that A[beta] 1 - 42 expression resulted in a defect in endocytosis that could be reverted by several of the genetic suppressors. In collaboration with the Caldwell lab, we showed that the genetic modifiers also modulated A[beta] 1 - 42 toxicity in a neuronal setting, C. elegans glutamatergic neurons. Finally, we showed that PICALM could protect primary rat cortical neuron cultures from A[beta] oligomer toxicity. by Sebastian Treusch. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Accurate {{segregation}} of chromosomes during cell division is accomplished through the assembly of a bipolar microtubule-based structure called the mitotic spindle. Work {{over the past two}} decades has identified a <b>core</b> regulator of <b>spindle</b> bipolarity, the microtubule motor protein kinesin- 5. However, an increasing body of evidence has emerged demonstrating that kinesin- 5 -independent mechanisms driving bipolar spindle assembly exist as well.

50|$|Excavations {{conducted}} {{prior to}} commencement {{of building the}} Limerick Southern Ring Road and Limerick Tunnel uncovered treasures such as penannular ring pins, and several post-medieval brick-making kilns. Also recovered were a copper-alloy stick pin, a needle, two saddle querns, burnt stone deposits, and very high quantities of animal bone (including worked antler handles, horn <b>cores,</b> and <b>spindle</b> whorls, indicating textile making), alder wood charcoal, and charred hazelnut shells. The largest site uncovered was an Early Christian ditched enclosure at Coonagh West with a diameter of 40m that exploited a glacial drumlin, including a series of shallow gullies and oak post holes {{both internal and external}} to the enclosure, indicative of houses having been present dating back to the 16th century BC, a 27m trackway that enabled access to and from the river, pits, a hearth, as well as some pottery. Archaeologists suggested that {{it may have been a}} type of ringfort that exploited a dry gravel mound in a predominantly wet and marginal landscape.|$|R
40|$|Background: Primary {{extradural}} meningiomas (PEMs) are rare, {{particularly those}} involving the paraspinal cervical area, so {{little is known}} about them. We identified a new case and compare it with 10 previous cases, address the diagnostic challenges, and highlight the clinical and pathologic characteristics. Methods: This study is a case report and literature review of cases reported since 1976. Results: A 59 -year-old man presented with right neck stiffness and discomfort over several months, which is consistent with other cases. CT scan and MRI revealed a paraspinal cervical mass. FNA and <b>core</b> biopsy revealed <b>spindle</b> cells with whorling consistent with meningioma. The patient underwent complete en bloc resection of the tumor. The PEM was histologically benign. Conclusion: Cervical PEMs should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a deep neck mass. These tumors are typically benign and are surgically resected. PublishedN/...|$|R

40|$|The small GTPase Ran enzyme regulates {{critical}} eukaryotic cellular functions including nuclear {{transport and}} mitosis {{through the creation}} of a RanGTP gradient around the chromosomes. This concentration gradient is created by the chromatin bound RCC 1 (regulator of chromosome condensation) protein which recruits Ran to nucleosomes and activates Ranâs nucleotide exchange activity. While RCC 1 has been shown to bind directly with the nucleosome, the molecular details of this interaction were not known. We have determined the crystal structure of the RCC 1 -nucleosome core particle complex at 2. 9 Ã resolution, providing the first atomic view of how a chromatin protein interacts with the histone and DNA components of the nucleosome. Our structure also suggests that the Widom 601 DNA positioning sequence present in our nucleosomes forms a 145 bp and not the expected canonical 147 bp nucleosome <b>core</b> particle. Mitotic <b>spindle</b> formation, the transport of macromolecules between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and nuclear envelope formation are critical functions of a eukaryotic cell. These seemingly disparate functions are all regulated by a concentration gradient of the small GTPase Ran in its GTP bound state (RanGTP) around the chromosomes 1 â 3. This RanGT...|$|R
40|$|Apicomplexan parasites {{can change}} {{fundamental}} features of cell division during their life cycles, suspending cytokinesis when needed and changing proliferative scale in different hosts and tissues. The structural and molecular {{basis for this}} remarkable cell cycle flexibility is not fully understood, although the centrosome serves {{a key role in}} determining when and how much replication will occur. Here we describe the discovery of multiple replicating core complexes with distinct protein composition and function in the centrosome of Toxoplasma gondii. An outer core complex distal from the nucleus contains the TgCentrin 1 /TgSfi 1 protein pair, along with the cartwheel protein TgSas- 6 and a novel Aurora-related kinase, while an inner core closely aligned with the unique spindle pole (centrocone) holds distant orthologs of the CEP 250 /C-Nap protein family. This outer/inner spatial relationship of centrosome cores is maintained throughout the cell cycle. When in metaphase, the duplicated cores align to opposite sides of the kinetochores in a linear array. As parasites transition into S phase, the cores sequentially duplicate, outer core first and inner core second, ensuring that each daughter parasite inherits one copy of each type of centrosome core. A key serine/threonine kinase distantly related to the MAPK family is localized to the centrosome, where it restricts core duplication to once per cycle and ensures the proper formation of new daughter parasites. Genetic analysis of the outer core in a temperature-sensitive mutant demonstrated this core functions primarily in cytokinesis. An inhibition of ts-TgSfi 1 function at high temperature caused the loss of outer cores and a severe block to budding, {{while at the same time}} the inner core amplified along with the unique spindle pole, indicating the inner <b>core</b> and <b>spindle</b> pole are independent and co-regulated. The discovery of a novel bipartite organization in the parasite centrosome that segregates the functions of karyokinesis and cytokinesis provides an explanation for how cell cycle flexibility is achieved in apicomplexan life cycles...|$|R

They used this hybrid yarn {{structure in the}} weft with varying weft densities to analyse its impacts on EMSE, moreover, they investigated different proportions of Ag/PA {{and concluded that the}} higher the % age of conductive material in blend the higher will be the EMSE. Several other researchers used somewhat similar techniques to incorporate the conductive filament in core, like, Yu et al. (2014), inserted stainless steel wire of 50 Â Î¼m in core by using hollow spinning machine, the covering components were Antibacterial Nylon and Bamboo Charcoal Polyester filament. Siro core spinning system with double roving as outer layers and stainless steel core was examined for the effects of orientation of fibres within the structure by Ortlek et al. (2012). Recently, Yu et al. (2015), incorporated stainless steel wire in <b>core</b> using hollow <b>spindle</b> spinning in order to investigate the functional and EMSE of elastic warp knitted fabrics. They concluded that multi-layered fabrics with laminating angles 0 Â°/ 90 Â° produced better results as compared to 0 Â°/ 0 Â° layered fabrics due to the formation of metal grids in the arrangement.|$|R

We describe a 62 -year-old woman with history, physical examination, and imaging suggestive of metastatic ovarian cancer. CA- 125 was elevated at 1291 [*]U/mL. Paracenteses were negative for malignant cells and <b>core</b> biopsy showed <b>spindle</b> cell proliferation. A primary debulking surgery for a presumed ovarian cancer was planned. Method and Results. At surgery, 6 liters of ascites were drained. The uterus, ovaries, peritoneum, and omentum were normal. An 18 Ã 11 Ã 7 [*]cm retroperitoneal mass was found between the left ureter and the sigmoid mesocolon, wrapped with sigmoid colon. Fallopian tubes and ovaries were normal. The mass was resected en bloc with the sigmoid colon, uterus, ovaries, and omentum. Microscopically, there was spindle cell proliferation typical of fibrothecoma. No ovarian tissue was identified in association with the tumor. Conclusion. This third case of extraovarian fibrothecoma highlights the importance of obtaining histologic evidence of malignancy prior to initiating neoadjuvant chemotherapy for a presumed ovarian cancer...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{role of the}} MYC {{oncogene}} in the apoptotic pathways is {{not fully}} understood. MYC {{has been reported to}} protect cells from apoptosis activation but also to sensitize cells to apoptotic stimuli. We have previously demonstrated that the down-regulation of Myc protein activates apoptosis in melanoma cells and increases the susceptibility of cells to various antitumoral treatments. Beyond the well-known role in the G 1 [...] >S transition, MYC is also involved in the G 2 -M cell cycle phases regulation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study we have investigated how MYC could influence cell survival signalling during G 2 and M phases. We used the microtubules damaging agent paclitaxel (PTX), to arrest the cells in the M phase, in a p 53 mutated melanoma cell line with modulated Myc level and activity. An overexpression of Myc protein is able to increase endoreduplication favoring the survival of cells exposed to antimitotic poisoning. The PTX-induced endoreduplication is associated in Myc overexpressing cells with a reduced expression of MAD 2, essential component of the molecular <b>core</b> of the <b>spindle</b> assembly checkpoint (SAC), indicating an impairment of this checkpoint. In addition, {{for the first time we}} have localized Myc protein at the spindle poles (centrosomes) during pro-metaphase in different cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of Myc at the poles during the prometaphase could be necessary for the Myc-mediated attenuation of the SAC and the subsequent induction of endoreduplication. In addition, our data strongly suggest that the use of taxane in antitumor therapeutic strategies should be rationally based on the molecular profile of the individual tumor by specifically analyzing Myc expression levels...|$|R
