50|$|LED {{fixtures}} create colour through {{additive colour}} mixing with red, green, blue, {{and in some}} cases amber, LEDs at different intensities. This type of color mixing is often used with borderlights and <b>cyclorama</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{opening of}} samad is {{the gap in}} the housing from where the beam of light is {{intended}} to come. Many fixtures use a lens to help control the beam of light, though some, such as border or <b>cyclorama</b> <b>lights,</b> do not have any lenses or optics other than the reflector. The lens and the reflector, along with other beam-altering devices are both considered part of the optics system.|$|R
50|$|On 29 January 2016 {{the program}} aired another {{speciality}} episode, focussing {{on the year}} 1977. None of the regular set was used, instead replaced by a white <b>cyclorama</b> with coloured <b>lights</b> and pot plants. An effect {{was added to the}} screen to simulate broadcasts in the 1970s.|$|R
5000|$|LED {{instruments}} can {{and have}} been used to replace any conventional lighting fixture, and some shows, such as Radiohead's 2008 tour, have used only LED lighting instruments. [...] However, most shows use LEDs only for <b>lighting</b> <b>cycloramas,</b> or as top, side or back light. They can also be used as 'audience blinders' (lights pointed directly at the audience from a low angle).|$|R

Most shows use LEDs only for <b>lighting</b> <b>cycloramas,</b> or as top, side, or back light due to their low throw distance.

50|$|The DHS Auditorium is a {{proscenium}} style {{theater that}} seats 914 persons {{and is used}} for assemblies and productions of dance, musical theater, and concerts by soloists and large ensembles. The Auditorium's stage house measures 3200 sq ft with a proscenium that is 35 ft wide, 18 ft high and a stage that is 30 ft deep to the <b>cyclorama.</b> The <b>lighting</b> grid is 30 ft high. The Studio Theatre is located immediately adjacent to the Auditorium and {{is used as a}} backstage area during Auditorium productions. The orchestra pit is located at house level and can contain up to thirty musicians. The stage house has a 7-line, manual, single purchase counterweight fly system, with 500-pound capacity per line-set. In addition, the Auditorium houses a walk-draw white cyclorama, movable tormentors, four travelers, dead-hung teasers and a walk draw black scrim.|$|R
25|$|Strip lights, {{also known}} as <b>cyclorama</b> or cyc <b>lights</b> (thus named because they are {{effective}} for <b>lighting</b> the <b>cyclorama,</b> a curtain {{at the back of}} the stage), border lights, and codas (by the brand name), are long housings typically containing multiple lamps arranged along the length of the instrument and emitting light perpendicular to its length. Lamps are often covered with gels of multiple colors (often red, green, and blue, which, in theory, allow almost any color to be mixed) with each color controlled by a separate electrical dimmer circuit. Many striplights use round pieces of glass (called roundels) rather than plastic gels for color. Roundels can sustain heavy use for a long time without fading and are often found in more permanent installations.|$|R
