6000|$|The {{preliminary}} step {{to doing}} {{it seemed to be}} a general turn over of the Hebrew's shawls, all of which, though many were beautiful, she rejected one after another until she found an old and considerably worn grey one. This she shook out and examined with approving nods, as if it were the finest fabric that ever had issued from the looms of Cashmere. Tying her luxuriant hair into a tight knot behind, and smoothing it down on each side of her face, and well back so as not to be obtrusive, she flung the old shawl over her head, induced a series of wrinkles to <b>corrugate</b> her fair brow; drew in her lips so as to conceal her teeth, and, by the same action, to give an aquiline turn to her nose; bowed her back, and, in short, converted herself into a little old woman! ...|$|E
6000|$|Wade Atsheler is dead--dead {{by his own}} hand. To {{say that}} this was entirely {{unexpected}} by the small coterie which knew him, would be to say an untruth; and yet never once had we, his intimates, ever canvassed the idea. Rather had we been prepared for it in some incomprehensible subconscious way. Before the perpetration of the deed, its possibility is remotest from our thoughts; but when we did know that he was dead, it seemed, somehow, that we had understood and looked forward to it all the time. This, by retrospective analysis, we could easily explain by the fact of his great trouble. I use [...] "great trouble" [...] advisedly. Young, handsome, with an assured position as the right-hand man of Eben Hale, the great street-railway magnate, there could be no reason for him to complain of fortune's favors. Yet we had watched his smooth brow furrow and <b>corrugate</b> as under some carking care or devouring sorrow. We had watched his thick, black hair thin and silver as green grain under brazen skies and parching drought. Who can forget, {{in the midst of the}} hilarious scenes he toward the last sought with greater and greater avidity--who can forget, I say, the deep abstractions and black moods into which he fell? At such times, when the fun rippled and soared from height to height, suddenly, without rhyme or reason, his eyes would turn lacklustre, his brows knit, as with clenched hands and face overshot with spasms of mental pain he wrestled on the edge of the abyss with some unknown danger.|$|E
40|$|Linear <b>Corrugating</b> is {{a process}} for the {{manufacture}} of corrugated containers in which the flutes of the corrugated medium are oriented in the Machine Direction (MD) of the several layers of paper used. Conversely, in the conventional <b>corrugating</b> process the flutes are oriented {{at right angles to}} the MD in the Cross Machine Direction (CD). Paper is stronger in MD than in CD. Therefore, boxes made using the Linear <b>Corrugating</b> process are significantly stronger-in the prime strength criteria, Box Compression Test (BCT) than boxes made conventionally. This means that using Linear <b>Corrugating</b> boxes can be manufactured to BCT equaling conventional boxes but containing 30 % less fiber. The corrugated container industry is {{a large part of the}} U. S. economy, producing over 40 million tons annually. For such a large industry, the potential savings of Linear <b>Corrugating</b> are enormous. The grant for this project covered three phases in the development of the Linear <b>Corrugating</b> process: (1) Production and evaluation of corrugated boxes on commercial equipment to verify that boxes so manufactured would have enhanced BCT as proposed in the application; (2) Production and evaluation of corrugated boxes made on laboratory equipment using combined board from (1) above but having dual manufactures joints (glue joints). This box manufacturing method (Dual Joint) is proposed to overcome box perimeter limitations of the Linear <b>Corrugating</b> process; (3) Design, Construction, Operation and Evaluation of an engineering prototype machine to form flutes in <b>corrugating</b> medium in the MD of the paper. This operation is the central requirement of the Linear <b>Corrugating</b> process. Items I and II were successfully completed, showing predicted BCT increases from the Linear Corrugated boxes and significant strength improvement in the Dual Joint boxes. The Former was constructed and operated successfully using kraft linerboard as the forming medium. It was found that tensile strength and stretch characteristics of the <b>corrugating</b> medium were not sufficient to allow fluting this paper in the former. Possible causes and corrective actions to overcome this problem are addressed in the body of the report below...|$|R

40|$|Graphene is {{intrinsically}} non-flat and <b>corrugates</b> randomly. Since the <b>corrugating</b> physics of atomically-thin graphene is {{strongly tied to}} its electronics properties, randomly <b>corrugating</b> morphology of graphene poses significant challenge to its application in nanoelectronic devices for which precise (digital) control is the key. Recent studies revealed that the morphology of substrate-supported graphene is regulated by the graphene-substrate interaction, thus is distinct from the random intrinsic morphology of freestanding graphene. The regulated extrinsic morphology of graphene sheds light on new pathways to fine tune the properties of graphene. To guide further research to explore these fertile opportunities, this paper reviews recent progress on modeling and experimental studies of the extrinsic morphology of graphene under {{a wide range of}} external regulation, including two dimensional and one dimensional substrate surface features and one dimensional and zero dimensional nanoscale scaffolds (e. g., nanowires and nanoparticles).

50|$|Laminar {{flame speed}} is a {{property}} of the mixture (fuel structure, stoichiometry) and thermodynamic conditions upon mixture ignition (pressure, temperature). Turbulent flame speed {{is a function of}} the aforementioned parameters, but also heavily depends on the flow field. As flow velocity increases and turbulence is introduced, a flame will begin to wrinkle, then <b>corrugate</b> and eventually the flame front will be broken and transport properties will be enhanced by turbulent eddies in the flame zone. As a result, the flame front of a turbulent flame will propagate at a speed that is not only a function of the mixture's chemical and transport properties but also properties of the flow and turbulence.|$|E
5000|$|Wester {{collected}} ripe samuyao (small-fruited papeda, Citrus micrantha var. microcarpa) fruit specimens from cultivation in Cebu and Bohol in June, {{and from}} November to February.

Wester also recorded a somewhat more vigorous variety, called [...] "samuyao-sa-amoo" [...] in Bohol, with slightly larger fruits; there is a possibility that this species was actually Limonellus aurarius, described by Georg Eberhard Rumphius back in 1741 in a nearby area, although his description also fits a number of related species.Wester gave the botanical description: [...] A shrubby tree, 4.5 meters tall, with slender branches and small, weak spines; leaves 55 to 80 millimeters long, 20 to 25 millimeters broad, ovate to ovate-oblong or elliptical, crenulate, thin, of distinct fragrance, base rounded to broadly acute; apex obtuse, sometimes notched, petioles 20 to 30 millimeters long, broadly winged, about 14 millimeters wide, wing area somewhat less than one-half of the leaf blade; flowers in compact axillary or terminal cymes, 2 to 7, small, 5 to 9 millimeters in diameter, white, with trace of purple on the outside; calyx small, not cupped, petals 3 to 5; stamens 15 to 18, free, equal; ovary very small, globose to obovate; locules 7 to 9, style distinct; stigma small, knob like; fruit 15 to 20 millimeters in diameter, roundish in outline; base sometimes nippled; apex an irregular, wrinkly cavity; surface <b>corrugate,</b> greenish lemon yellow; oil cells usually sunken; skin very thin; pulp fairly juicy, acid, bitter with distinct aroma; juice cells very minute, blunt, containing a small, greenish nucleus; seeds small, flattened, sometimes beaked.

Corrugated fiberboard (termed <b>corrugate),</b> which constitutes a significant fraction of the municipal solid waste stream in the United States (approximately one third by weight), was used as a partial replacement for fine aggregate in CLSM at aggregate replacement ratios ranging from 0 % (i. e., control) to 6 %. The <b>corrugate</b> was fiberized (i. e., repulped) in a blender prior to being mixed with other constituents in the CLSM. The density, air conÂ­tent, and flow consistency of the fresh CLSM were determined, and bleeding was qualitatively assessed. Also, the unconfined compressive strength was determined for the resulting mixtures at different test ages. As the <b>corrugate</b> content increased, air content and water demand increased, density and compressive strength decreased, and some mixtures exhibited excessive bleeding.
