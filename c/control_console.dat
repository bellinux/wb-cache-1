5|$|One change {{made during}} {{production}} was augmented pitch control to avoid deep stall conditions at high angles of attack. The stall issue {{had been raised}} during development, but had originally been discounted. Model tests of the YF-16 conducted by the Langley Research Center revealed a potential problem, but no other laboratory was able to duplicate it. YF-16 flight tests were not sufficient to expose the issue; later flight testing on the FSD aircraft demonstrated {{there was a real}} concern. In response, the areas of the horizontal stabilizer were increased 25% on the Block 15 aircraft in 1981 and later retrofitted to earlier aircraft. In addition, a manual override switch to disable the horizontal stabilizer flight limiter was prominently placed on the <b>control</b> <b>console,</b> allowing the pilot to regain control of the horizontal stabilizers (which the flight limiters otherwise lock in place) and recover. Besides reducing the risk of deep stalls, the larger horizontal tail also improved stability and permitted faster takeoff rotation.|$|E

25|$|Time Platform - One of Doctor Doom's most ingenious creations is this {{functioning}} time machine. It {{consists of}} a platform 10 feet (3.0m) by 10 feet (3.0m) by 6 inches (150mm) and a separate <b>control</b> <b>console.</b> Subjects stand upon the platform, while an operator works the controls. The device can transport characters to virtually any time and place in Earth's timestream, and the operator can instantly return the travelers by manipulating the <b>control</b> <b>console.</b> Doctor Doom {{does not require the}} console to return to his own timeâ€”he can use the time-circuitry built into his own armor, allowing him to venture into time and return on his own without relying on someone to bring him back.|$|E

25|$|The {{digital and}} solid state Type 726-4 decoy {{launcher}} system {{is mounted on}} the forward deck and consists of four launchers. Each launcher has 18 tubes arranged in three six-tube rows. Firing is typically controlled automatically by the combat data system, but a manual <b>control</b> <b>console</b> is also provided. The decoy launcher system may theoretically be linked to other subsystems, although whether this feature is incorporated in the Type 052C is unknown.|$|E
25|$|The {{availability}} of small inexpensive computing platforms, LEDs, and compact powerful batteries allows special effects {{to be built}} into props, costumes, and scenery. Lighting, atmospherics, sounds, even motorized movement can be programmed into devices and controlled by the actors or remotely. WiFi and Bluetooth devices allow for wireless communication between the <b>control</b> <b>console</b> and the effect. For example, the LEDs built into a dress can be remotely illuminated; the console can even tell them what color to emit. Costumes in Head Over Heels (a musical by Lolita Snipes), The Wiz, and The Winter's Tale are recent examples of wireless control. Lanterns, candles, fireflies, and other effects built into props and scenery also utilize embedded electronics.|$|E

25|$|A {{lighting}} designer (LD) {{is familiar}} with the various types of lighting instruments and their uses. In consultation with the director, the DSM (deputy stage manager) and the scenic designer, and after observing rehearsals, the LD creates an instrument schedule and a light plot as well as informing the DSM where each LX (lighting) cue is designed to be triggered in the script, which the DSM notes down in his plot book. The schedule is a list of all required lighting equipment, including color gel, gobos, color wheels, barndoors and other accessories. The light plot is typically a plan view of the theatre where the performance will take place, with every luminaire marked. This typically specifies the approximate lighting focus and direction, a reference number, accessories, and the channel number of the dimmer system or lighting <b>control</b> <b>console.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1976 the Luxury and Regency {{editions of}} the {{full-size}} 98s were offered, in 2-door coupes or 4-door hardtops. 4-doors had an extra window (like an opera window) in the C-pillar. A landau roof option for the coupe gave it a huge-looking opera window. Like the Custom Cruiser, 98s had a dual section eggcrate-design grille, with new front end panel, front bumper, and wraparound horizontal parking lamps. Amber marker lenses aligned with the headlamps wrapped around the fender sides. Separate clear cornering lamps had horizontal ribs. Vertical tailamps were decorated with a small emblem in each lens. Tiny back-up lamps stood alongside the license plate, on a panel that also contained small red lenses next to the tailamps. Standard 98 equipment included a 455 CID Rocket V8 with 4-barrel carburetor, Turbo-Hydramatic, vari-ratio power steering, power brakes, power driver's seat, driver's door armrest <b>control</b> <b>console,</b> electronic message center, electric clock, fold-down center armrests, front ashtray, and JR78 x 15 blackwall steel-belted radials. Rear fender skirts and bumper impact strips were also standard. A new 2.41:1 axle ratio became standard to improve fuel economy.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Seacrest was {{monitoring}} the ship's fire <b>control</b> <b>console,</b> which graphically displayed the relative position, bearing, {{and speed of}} any sonar contacts in the area. [...] Seacrest had been monitoring three contacts on his screens, S-12, S-13 (Ehime Maru), and S-14. [...] Absorbed {{in trying to get}} a clearer picture on S-14's location, Seacrest failed to report the bearing and range of S-13 (Ehime Maru) to Waddle during Waddle's periscope search, which Seacrest's monitors now showed was about [...] away and closing. [...] During Waddle's periscope search, Seacrest was busy operating other control room instruments and did not actively monitor his fire control displays. [...] After the periscope search was over, and hearing Waddle's report of no visual contacts, Seacrest decided that his information for S-13 was incorrect and manually respotted the S-13 contact on his screen to a distance of [...] away.|$|E

500|$|The {{control box}} for the {{automatic}} pilot was {{recovered from the}} wreckage. [...] The control knob for its gyroscope was in the caged position and the CAGED warning flag was in view even though the control box carried a placard stating the gyro must be uncaged before takeoff. [...] The automatic pilot's speed valve unit was also recovered; it showed that the three valves were open in positions indicating the unit was operating {{at the time of}} the crash. [...] The investigation panel proposed that the automatic pilot might have been engaged at a height of about 400ft (120m) causing the aircraft to descend swiftly into the sea. Engagement could have occurred inadvertently when one of the pilots intended to select fuel cross-feed ON. The operating levers for fuel cross-feed and automatic pilot were the same shape, the same height above the cockpit floor, and about 12 inches (305mm) apart on the cockpit <b>control</b> <b>console.</b>|$|E
500|$|This {{was built}} in 1983 to replace the {{original}} (1900) swing bridge. [...] It is built of steel and powered by electricity. [...] The replacement work cost Â£0.5M and {{was part of a}} wider upgrade of the Navigation to conform to the 700-tonne Eurobarge standard (see Later Development section of this article). [...] An elevated control house was built for the sole use of operational staff, but in recent years a freestanding low level standard <b>control</b> <b>console</b> has been built for the use of boaters when the bridge is not staffed. [...] Sykehouse Lift Bridge (downstream of Barnby Dun) was built to the same technical specification. [...] Although the bridge carries an unclassified road linking Barnby Dun and Bentley, the bridge also provided the only access for heavy loads to the nearby Thorpe Marsh power station, so the bridge was designed to carry abnormal loads of up to 180 tons gross weight. [...] Although Thorpe Marsh Power Station has now been demolished, the bridge is still busy with road traffic. [...] This is because {{it is one of the}} few crossings of the Navigation in this area.|$|E
500|$|The Doctor's enemies {{begin to}} orbit overhead, and the Doctor buys himself {{additional}} {{time with a}} threatening speech. He urges River to bring the TARDIS to Stonehenge while he, Amy, Rory, and the legionaries prepare. When River tries to use the TARDIS, an outside force takes control of it and pilots it to Amy's house in the present day. After River leaves the TARDIS, the scanner screen cracks in the same shape as {{the cracks in the}} universe and a menacing voice says: [...] "Silence will fall." [...] River discovers landing patterns in Amy's garden and sees that someone has broken into the house. She finds in Amy's room a story book about Pandora's box and a children's book about Roman Britain. River communicates this to the Doctor, warning him that the Pandorica must be a trap, created out of Amy's memories. River identifies her current space-time coordinatesâ€”26 June 2010, the date the Doctor identified as the onset of the time energy explosion that caused the cracks in the universe ("Flesh and Stone"). The Doctor warns her to leave immediately, but she finds herself again trapped in the TARDIS as the central <b>control</b> <b>console</b> begins to go critical.|$|E

2500|$|Moving {{lights are}} {{controlled}} in many ways. Usually the fixtures {{are connected to}} a lighting <b>control</b> <b>console,</b> which outputs a control signal. This control signal sends data to the fixture usually {{in one of three}} ways: Analogue (which has largely been phased out), DMX (which stands for [...] "Digital Multiplex", also the industry standard control protocol), or Ethernet Control (such as ArtNet or sACN). The fixture then takes this signal and translates it into internal signals which are sent to the many stepper motors located inside.|$|E
