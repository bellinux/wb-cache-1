5000|$|A fantasy sport (also known less {{commonly}} as rotisserie or roto) {{is a type}} {{of online}} game where participants assemble imaginary or virtual teams of real players of a professional sport. These teams compete based on the statistical performance of those players' players in actual games. This performance is converted into points that are compiled and totaled according to a roster selected by each fantasy team's manager. These point systems can be simple enough to be manually calculated by a [...] "league commissioner" [...] who coordinates and manages the overall league, or points can be compiled and calculated using computers tracking actual results of the professional sport. In fantasy sports, team owners draft, trade and <b>cut</b> (<b>drop)</b> players, analogously to real sports.|$|E
40|$|Ankle sprains {{commonly}} {{occur during}} athletic competition {{and result in}} traumatic injury to the lateral ligament complex. Ankle ligament sprains {{are the most common}} injury type for intercollegiate soccer players and athletes that sustain lateral ankle sprains may lose game and/or practice time, have recurrent sprains due to ankle instability, incur proprioceptive deficits, and be at an increased risk of ankle osteoarthritis. The high rate of ankle injuries among soccer athletes demonstrates a need for novel and advanced data collection methodologies to reduce the incidence of lateral ankle sprains and improve injury prevention interventions. The purposes of this study were to develop instrumented soccer equipment to collect ankle joint kinematics in the field; establish {{the reliability and validity of}} a kinematic assessment using instrumented equipment during athletic maneuvers; and identify laboratory maneuvers that elicited game-like demands from athletes. Wireless orientation sensors were integrated into soccer shin guards and turf shoes. The instrumented equipment collected ankle joint kinematics during simulated athletic maneuvers in the laboratory and field. The simulated athletic maneuvers in the laboratory are commonly performed by soccer players and have been previously studied. Maneuvers included drop landing, drop jump, stop jump, and jump-stop <b>cut.</b> <b>Drop</b> landing and drop jump maneuvers resulted in poor to excellent reliability and very good to excellent validity. The stop jump maneuver resulted in poor to fair reliability and excellent validity. The jump-stop cut maneuver resulted in poor to excellent reliability and very good validity. The soccer-specific field maneuvers were jump header, moving jump header, and slalom. All maneuvers resulted in poor to good reliability. To identify laboratory maneuvers that elicited game-like demands, laboratory maneuvers of varied demand were compared to field maneuvers. Drop landing and drop jump maneuvers from a 60 cm platform elicited a similar response to the jump header maneuver. A jump distance recommendation for the stop jump maneuver was not warranted because jump distance did not significantly alter landing biomechanics. The instrumented equipment collected reliable and valid ankle joint kinematics in the sagittal plane and are a promising technology for in-game data collection and injury prevention. ...|$|E

30|$|As noted earlier, {{aggregate}} measures may hide {{important differences}} across individuals. Columns 3 – 5 report {{the percentage of}} workers receiving an earnings freeze, an earnings cut and an earnings rise; as is common in the literature, we classify a change of less than 0.1 % as an earnings freeze. These data reveal substantial flexibility. Similar to Blundell et al. (2014) for the UK and Elsby et al. (2015) for the US and the UK, we find that a non-trivial fraction of Irish workers report nominal earnings reductions in each year. In the pre-crisis period, the percentage of workers experiencing earnings cuts ranged from 17 to 23 %. In contrast to the US and the UK, this proportion increased substantially during the crisis, reaching a high of 55 % in 2009 / 10, compared to 24 % in the UK and 37 % in the US. In the post-crisis stagnation period, the proportion experiencing <b>cuts</b> <b>dropped</b> substantially, to about 34 %. However, this remains far above the pre-crisis norm.|$|R
