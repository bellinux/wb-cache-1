50|$|Mutations in {{the gene}} {{can lead to}} a {{defective}} protein and several forms of inherited arrhythmias as Long QT syndrome which is a prolongation of the QT interval of heart repolarization, Short QT syndrome, and Familial Atrial Fibrillation. KvLQT1 are also expressed in the pancreas, and KvLQT1 Long QT syndrome patients has been shown to have hyperinsulinemic hypoglycaemia following an oral glucose load. Currents arising from Kv7.1 in over-expression systems have never been recapitulated in native tissues - Kv7.1 is always found in native tissues with a modulatory subunit. In cardiac tissue, these subunits comprise KCNE1 and yotiao. Though physiologically irrelevant, homotetrameric Kv7.1 channels also display a unique form of C-type inactivation that reaches equilibrium quickly, allowing KvLQT1 currents to plateau. This is different from the inactivation seen in A-type currents, which causes rapid <b>current</b> <b>decay.</b>|$|E

The measurement agreed well with the Standard Model and placed significant constraints on numerous beyond the Standard Model proposals, such as charged Higgs and anomalous WWγ couplings. The analogous exclusive decay B+,0→ K*+,0 γ was also measured. CLEO and ARGUS reported nearly simultaneous measurements of inclusive charmless semileptonic B meson decays, which directly established a non-zero value of the CKM matrix element |Vub|. Exclusive charmless semileptonic B meson decays were first observed by CLEO six years later in the modes B → πlν, ρlν, and {{were used to determine}} |Vub|.

50|$|At {{the same}} time, {{developers}} {{were looking at}} using a different technique in metal detection called pulse induction. Unlike the beat frequency oscillator or the induction balance machines which both used a uniform alternating current at a low frequency, the pulse induction machine simply magnetized {{the ground with a}} relatively powerful, momentary current through a search coil. In the absence of metal, the field decayed at a uniform rate, and the time it took to fall to zero volts could be accurately measured. However, if metal was present when the machine fired, a small eddy current would be induced in the metal, and the time for sensed <b>current</b> <b>decay</b> would be increased. These time differences were minute, but the improvement in electronics made it possible to measure them accurately and identify the presence of metal at a reasonable distance. These new machines had one major advantage: they were mostly impervious to the effects of mineralization, and rings and other jewelry could now be located even under highly mineralized black sand. The addition of computer control and digital signal processing have further improved pulse induction sensors.|$|E

For this reason, CDF has {{searched for the}} one-loop neutral <b>current</b> <b>decay</b> b ′ → b + Z, assuming that the branching ratio into b + Z is 100 %; an analysis giving the bounds on mb ′ for smaller branching ratios is in preparation. In this Brief Report, we examine the neutral <b>current</b> <b>decay</b> b ′ → b + H, which will occur if the Higgs mass is less than mb ′−mb. Four different cases are examined: the sequential case, the non-chiral isosinglet case, the non-chiral isodoublet case, and a two-Higgs model with flavor-changing neutral currents. In the first three of these, the rates for b ′ → b+Z and b ′ → b+H are comparable, assuming comparable phase space factors; in the fourth, b ′ → b + H is completely dominant. Thus, we {{emphasize the importance of}} giving b ′ mass bounds {{as a function of the}} branching ratio into b + Z, since the assumption of a 100 % branching ratio for b ′ → b + Z may only be valid if the Higgs mas...|$|E

40|$|Voltage-gated Na channels, {{which are}} {{potential}} targets for general anaesthetics, are substrates for PKC, which phosphorylates a conserved {{site in the}} channel inactivation gate. We investigated the idea that PKC modulates the effect of volatile anaesthetics on Na channels via phosphorylation of this inactivation gate site. Na currents through rat skeletal muscle Na channel α-subunits expressed in Xenopus oocytes were measured by two-microelectrode voltage clamp {{in the presence of}} the volatile anaesthetic agent halothane (2 -bromo- 2 -chloro- 1, 1, 1 -trifluroethane). PKC activity was modulated by co-expression of a constitutively active PKC α-isozyme. Halothane (0. 4 [*]mM) had no effect on Na currents. With co-expression of PKC, however, halothane dose-dependently enhanced the rate of Na <b>current</b> <b>decay</b> and caused a small, but statistically significant reduction in Na current amplitude. The enhancement of Na <b>current</b> <b>decay</b> was absent in a Na channel mutant in which the inactivation gate phosphorylation site was disabled. Effects of halothane on amplitude were independent of this mutation. Co-expression of a PKC α-isozyme permits an effect of halothane to hasten <b>current</b> <b>decay</b> and reduce current amplitude, at least in part through interaction with the inactivation gate phosphorylation site.
