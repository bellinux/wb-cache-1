5|$|<b>Compositions</b> in the haridasa {{literature}} are sub-divided into four types: kirthane, suladi, ugabhoga and mundige. Kirthanes are devotional musical <b>compositions</b> with refrains based on raga and tala and celebrate {{the glory of}} god. The suladi are tala based, the ugabhoga are melody based while the mundige are {{in the form of}} riddles. <b>Compositions</b> were also modelled on jogula (lullaby songs) and sobane (marriage songs). A common feature of haridasa <b>compositions</b> are influences from the Hindu epics, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and Bhagavata.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] Automatic <b>composition</b> of web {{services}} supports the solving of complex user request. The set of possible solutions {{can be represented}} by a graph, modeling the <b>composition.</b> Usually, this kind of approach is highly simplified by considering only sequences of services. This paper proposes an algorithm for automatic semantic {{web services}} <b>composition,</b> which generates a graph taking into account any <b>composition</b> structure. The request resolution process identifies possible <b>composition</b> structures and selects relevant services based on their semantic description. The resulted <b>composition</b> graph answers all requested functionality with coherent <b>composition</b> structures.

5|$|Sulu-type <b>compositions</b> on the kulintangan {{are found}} among the Tausug, Samal, Yakan, Sama/Badjao, Iranun and Kadazan-Dusun. Though there exist no {{identifiable}} rhythmic or melodic differences between patterns with names such as the Maguindanao, each group has their own music <b>compositions.</b> For instance, the Tausug have three identifiable compositions—Kuriri, Sinug, and Lubak-Lubak—the Yakan have two—Tini-id and Kuriri—and the Dusun have three—Ayas, Kudidi and Tidung. Though these melodies vary even within groups like the Maguindanao and Maranao, one theme which characterizes the Sulu-type is the exchange of short melodic phrases between the kulintangan and the Agungs, where both instruments imitate and duplicate each other's rhythms very quickly. This is clearly seen in the Tausug Sinug and Yakan Tini-id and Kuriri <b>compositions</b> where this sort of jousting becomes a game of skill and virtuoso playing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a framework for}} automatic service <b>composition</b> which combines a <b>composition</b> graph model with an Ant Colony Optimization metaheuristic to find the optimal <b>composition</b> solution. The <b>composition</b> graph model encodes all the possible <b>composition</b> solutions that satisfy a user request. The graph will be further used as the search space for the ant-inspired selection method targeting {{the identification of the}} optimal <b>composition</b> solution. To identify the optimal <b>composition</b> solution we define a fitness function which uses the QoS attributes and the semantic quality as selection criteria. The proposed <b>composition</b> framework has been tested and evaluated on an extended version of the SAWSDL-TC benchmark.
