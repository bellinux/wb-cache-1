5|$|Historians' {{assessments}} of the Vengeance's career in Australian service differ. While there is <b>consensus</b> <b>that</b> the type was obsolete, some argue that it nevertheless proved successful. Others, including the RAAF's Air Power Development Centre, have judged that the Vengeance's performance was mixed and the type was not suited to Australia's requirements.|$|E

5|$|However, {{since this}} initial skepticism, {{biologists}} {{have come to}} a <b>consensus</b> <b>that</b> declines in amphibian populations are a real and severe threat to biodiversity.

5|$|In {{terms of}} the broader {{evolutionary}} relationships between the giant freshwater whipray {{and the rest of}} the family Dasyatidae, a 2012 phylogenetic analysis based on mitochondrial DNA reported that it was most closely related to the porcupine ray (Urogymnus asperrimus), and that they in turn formed a clade with the mangrove whipray (H. granulata) and the tubemouth whipray (H. lobistoma). This finding adds to a growing <b>consensus</b> <b>that</b> the genus Himantura is paraphyletic.|$|E
5|$|Jesus {{grew up in}} Galilee {{and much}} of his {{ministry}} took place there.

5|$|Modern writers {{also argue}} that Black has certain countervailing advantages. The <b>consensus</b> <b>that</b> White should try to win can be a {{psychological}} burden for the white player, who sometimes loses by trying too hard to win. Some symmetrical openings (i.e. those where both players make the same moves) can lead to situations where moving first is a disadvantage, either for psychological or objective reasons.|$|E

5|$|There is {{a general}} <b>consensus</b> <b>that</b> B center (sometimes called B1) {{consists}} of a carbon vacancy surrounded by four nitrogen atoms substituting for carbon atoms.

Diamonds where most nitrogen forms B centers are rare and are classed as type IaB; most gem diamonds contain a mixture of A and B centers, together with N3 centers.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a general}} <b>consensus</b> <b>that</b> the {{cerebellum}} is involved in pain processing. The cerebellum receives pain input from both descending cortico-cerebellar pathways and ascending spino-cerebellar pathways, through the pontine nuclei and inferior olives. Some of this information is transferred to the motor system inducing a conscious motor avoidance of pain, graded according to pain intensity.|$|E

The atrocities in East Pakistan were the first instances of war rape to attract international media attention, and Sally J.

The women's human rights organisation Bangladesh Mahila Parishat took part in the war by publicising the atrocities being carried out by the Pakistani army.|$|E

5|$|Though {{different}} theories abound as to {{the exact}} centuries the kulintang was finally realized, there is a <b>consensus</b> <b>that</b> kulintang music developed from a foreign musical tradition which was borrowed and adapted to the indigenous music tradition already present in the area.

5|$|A {{year after}} he took office, Bruce began {{investigating}} whether there would be interest in building a religious center and chapel complex at the school. After several years of negotiations with the various religious denominations which had operated on and off campus, Bruce engineered a <b>consensus</b> <b>that</b> the university would build a center based {{on the model of}} the Armed Forces Base Chapel. The new religious center would have a single chapel which would be shared by all of the groups, and office space for each group. The center opened in 1965 and was named for Bruce.|$|E

5|$|Compared to {{most other}} {{important}} crops, {{little is known}} about the domestication, dispersal and cultivation history of the cowpea. Although there is no archaeological evidence for early cowpea cultivation the centre of diversity of the cultivated cowpea is West Africa, leading an early <b>consensus</b> <b>that</b> this is the likely centre of origin and place of early domestication. New research using molecular markers has suggested that domestication may have instead occurred in East Africa and currently both theories carry equal weight.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the general}} {{reputation}} as a mass producer and a <b>consensus</b> <b>that</b> the region {{is in the midst}} of an economic crisis, parts of the Languedoc wine industry are experiencing commercial success due to outside investment and an increased focus on quality. Sales have been improved by many vineyards that concentrate on creating a good brand name rather than relying on the sometimes infamous regional designations. Some vineyards have adopted the youngest batch of AOC classifications developed in the late 1990s, while other vineyards eschew designated blends entirely and are instead shifting toward bottling single varietal wines, a practice increasingly demanded by consumers in the large New World wine market.|$|E
5|$|From 1830 to 1833, {{geologist}} Charles Lyell {{published his}} multi-volume work Principles of Geology, which, building on Hutton's ideas, advocated a uniformitarian {{alternative to the}} catastrophic theory of geology. Lyell claimed that, rather than being the products of cataclysmic (and possibly supernatural) events, the geologic features of the Earth are better explained {{as the result of}} the same gradual geologic forces observable in the present day—but acting over immensely long periods of time. Although Lyell opposed evolutionary ideas (even questioning the <b>consensus</b> <b>that</b> the fossil record demonstrates a true progression), his concept that the Earth was shaped by forces working gradually over an extended period, and the immense age of the Earth assumed by his theories, would strongly influence future evolutionary thinkers such as Charles Darwin.|$|E

5|$|In the comitatus, {{there is}} <b>consensus</b> <b>that</b> vexillationes were c. 500 and legiones c. 1,000 strong. The {{greatest}} uncertainty concerns {{the size of}} the crack auxilia palatina infantry regiments, originally formed by Constantine. The evidence is contradictory, suggesting that these units could have been either c. 500 or c. 1,000 strong, or somewhere in between. If the higher figure were true, then there would be little to distinguish auxilia from legiones, which is the strongest argument in favour of c. 500.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{during this}} time of {{increased}} media publicity of the controversy, public health officials and institutions did little to rebut the concerns and speculative theories being offered. Media attention and polarization of the debate has also been fueled by personal injury lawyers who took out full-page ads in prominent newspapers and offered financial support for expert witnesses who dissented from the scientific <b>consensus</b> <b>that</b> there is no convincing evidence for a link between thiomersal and autism. Paul Offit, a leading vaccine researcher and advocate, {{has said that the}} media has a tendency to provide false balance by perpetually presenting both sides of an issue even when only one side is supported by the evidence and thereby giving a platform for the spread of misinformation.|$|E
5|$|The mid-1880s {{marked a}} turning point in Shaw's life, both {{personally}} and professionally: he lost his virginity, had two novels published, and began a career as a critic. He had been celibate until his twenty-ninth birthday, when his shyness was overcome by Jane (Jenny) Patterson, a widow some years his senior. Their affair continued, not always smoothly, for eight years. Shaw's sex life has caused much speculation and debate among his biographers, but there is a <b>consensus</b> <b>that</b> the relationship with Patterson was one of his few non-platonic romantic liaisons.|$|E
