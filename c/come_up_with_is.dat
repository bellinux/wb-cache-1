But the best they can <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>is</b> an assistant government whip". Tony Lloyd, chairman of the parliamentary Labour Party, called the rebellion a [...] "bit of a sideshow", and Emily Thornberry MP called Brown the [...] "best qualified" [...] to lead Britain through the economic crisis of 2008. The Labour Party said that it had received letters from a small number of MPs asking why no nomination papers had been released.

500|$|O'Reilly {{explained}} that Naomi's style was {{harder to get}} right and she worked with the producers, costume and make-up departments {{to find the right}} look. The actress said, [...] "she has {{to have a sense of}} sass and sexuality about her, but she's not cheap and she has worked very hard to shake off her trashy past. What we've <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>is</b> amazing. Some days I put my costume on for a scene and think, 'Oh Naomi, you're outrageous! I could never wear this! Oh well. Go get 'em girl!'" [...] O'Reilly thought some of Naomi's outfits complimented her [...] "quite sexual" [...] nature, especially the six-inch heels and small tops. O'Reilly admitted that she did not have too much in common with Naomi, but they could both be [...] "goofy and funny". She thought Naomi was definitely not as level-headed as she was in real life. She also said that she enjoyed playing a character who was different from herself. Executive producer Jason Herbison told Sarah Ellis from Inside Soap that he thought Naomi's type of character – a [...] "classic, troublemaking vixen, who underneath it all is just deeply insecure" [...] – had been missing from Neighbours for a few years.|$|E
500|$|... "Mutt Romney Blues" [...] is a three-chord, {{acoustic}} Delta blues song. Drawing {{parallels between}} the Mitt Romney dog incident and his political [...] "plans and schemes", the song criticizes Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and is sung {{from the perspective of}} the Romney family's dog. Cooder was inspired by Al Sharpton's quote [...] "how he treated his dog tells you a lot about him", and found the dog to be [...] "a useful character... when you view it in the light of the blues. Like a servant, a yardman, someone very low in the social order. He's just begging to be let down [...]" [...] Bud Scoppa of Uncut characterizes the song as [...] "the musical equivalent of a political cartoon". [...] "Brother Is Gone" [...] is poignantly styled as a sad folktale and features a haunting mandolin riff, a rueful tone, and wounded vocals. Its lyrics attribute the conservative Koch Brothers to the Deal with the Devil myth, which Cooder adapted from Robert Johnson's [...] "Cross Road Blues". The lyrics cite their [...] "crossroads" [...] as [...] "the prairie town of Wichita", where Koch Industries is headquartered. He said in an interview that [...] "the only logical explanation for the Brothers I could <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>is,</b> they made their deal at the crossroads with Satan."

50|$|There are {{currently}} multiple possible explanations {{as to how}} the Hemoglobin variant Hopkins-2 works. One explanation that scientists have <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>is</b> that Ho-2 is created due to a point mutation causing the substitution of histidine by aspartic acid. The other explanation is that there is an unequal crossing over between two α genes which explains the replacement of histidine by aspartic acid. This then led a deletion occurring within the chromosome housing Ho-2. This deletion removes the region where the N-terminus is located in the major α-chain and where the c-terminus is located on the minor α-chain. Deletion of the N-terminus inactivates enzymes and halting their ability to cut chains at certain areas, which inevitably damages the chain.|$|E

50|$|Cub Koda of AllMusic {{said the}} song was a record much bigger than his jazz recordings, and the {{subsequent}} trips back to the well that followed on album and singles are all collected here on a 1998 compilation album.

It doesn't necessarily mean Apollo is a Ray analogue, just that Monarch grouped him together with the other two." ...|$|R
5000|$|Surfside {{began her}} third {{season in the}} Grade I Santa Monica Handicap over seven furlongs at Santa Anita on January 27 in for which she started odds on {{favorite}} despite carrying top weight of 121 pounds. She finished third, beaten a length and three length by Nany's Sweep and Serenita. On February 18 at the same track, Surfside started 2/5 favorite for the Grade I Santa Maria Handicap, but after disputing the early lead she dropped back and finished last of the five runners behind the Argentinian mare Lovellon. Pat Day said [...] "I never had any horse today. The only thing I can <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>is</b> she just obviously doesn't like this racetrack. She trains well over the track in the mornings, but she's just not showing up in the afternoons".|$|E
5000|$|But reviews {{have noted}} {{more than just}} makeup. Phil Hardy writes that [...] "cinematographer Russel Metty and special effects man Clifford Stine {{make the most of}} the ape-man's path of {{destruction}} through the campus but the script lacks any sparkle." [...] Senn calls the film [...] "visually flat, with the 'action' taking place in labs, offices and cabins, and with exteriors consisting of one back-lot hillside." [...] And Warren says that the film is [...] "hampered by trivial locations and drab sets. The film has no arresting images. The best Arnold can <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>is</b> a swift glance the ape-man gives a mirror before smashing it and one shot of a woman dangling by her hair from a tree," [...] In summary, he calls the film [...] "routine, unimaginative and foolish ... Jack Arnold's worst science fiction film." ...|$|E
5000|$|Dahill {{stated that}} the {{spin-off}} would not be season two of Crownies {{and that it would}} take the characters in different directions. He told Knox that there were certain elements of Crownies that worked well and {{he did not want to}} lose them because of poor ratings. He continued [...] "So what Screentime have <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>is</b> a really great compromise that allows us to keep the best bits, and learn and move on." [...] Knox added that a spin-off is rare in Australian television drama, but not unprecedented. On 20 August 2012, ABC TV confirmed that it had commissioned the Crownies spin-off, Janet King. The series was billed as an 8-part legal and political thriller. Janet King was produced by Karl Zwicky, Jane Allen and Lisa Scott, with Hilary Bonney acting as story consultant. Greg Haddrick, Jane Allen, Kris Mrksa and Shaun Grant wrote the series.|$|E
5000|$|In a radio interview, {{director}} Ryan Davies said: [...] "The idea we <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>was</b> that of {{this guy}} who's completely mental playing the piano until his fingers bleed and attacking random people on the street. There's {{a lot of blood}} and gore. The band wanted the video to be juxtaposed to the song, because there's no piano in the actual song." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Philip The Ghost" [...] - In the 1970s, a {{group of}} Canadian parapsychologists wanted to attempt an {{experiment}} to create a ghost, proving their theory that the human mind can produce spirits through expectation, imagination and visualization. The experiment took place in Toronto, Canada, in 1972, {{under the direction of}} the world-renowned expert on poltergeists, Dr A. R. G. Owen. What they <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with...</b> <b>was</b> Philip.|$|R
25|$|In the mid-1950s, in Germany, Volkswagen Beetle {{production}} was increasing beyond {{the capacity of}} highway trucks (autocarriers). Volkswagen engineers worked with German railroads to design a railroad car that was basically an extra long version of a vehicle hauling trailer. The design they <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>was</b> able to carry 10 vehicles on one car. VW's two-level flatcar design effectively became the first autorack, entering service circa 1954.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the basic}} design for boardshorts remains largely the same, some {{manufacturers}} {{have taken advantage}} of new technology. Because surfers and other water-sports enthusiasts commonly wear boardshorts without underwear, one of the major complaints has been about the use of velcro for the fly closure which tends to entangle pubic hair. A solution that some manufactures have <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>is</b> to use a neoprene fly, which does not allow the fly to completely open, but provides enough stretch so that the shorts can be easily pulled on and off. Pubic hair does not get caught on the neoprene fly. To remedy another common complaint, about boardshorts stitching in the inseam area which would rub directly against the wearer's skin, many manufacturers switched to a seamless design, or use welding or glue, rather than stitches. Although it is very common for boardshorts to be worn without underwear, some male wearers prefer to wear compression shorts, boxers, a jockstrap or briefs under them. Some female surfers wear a swimsuit or bikini bottom under boardshorts.|$|E
50|$|Back {{in present}} time, Sara and Haider become good friends, and she becomes {{accustomed}} to living at Arfeen's home, though she still speculates {{about what happened}} between him and her mother. She visits {{the rest of her}} family, including her aunts and uncles, and each person she asks refuses to give her any details about what happened. Arfeen, meanwhile, is worried that Sara will eventually leave his house. The only solution he can <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>is</b> to have Haider married to Sara. Haider not being mentally ready for marriage, argues with his father but out of his loving father's earnest wish as also because he definitely had developed a fond feeling for Sara by now, he agrees. Sara agrees to the marriage as well. But {{on the day of the}} wedding, Sara goes missing. Arfeen panics and asks Sara's aunt Aqsa (Nausheen Shah) whether she told Sara what happened with her mother, and she says she did not. This prompts Haider to ask what happened, and Arfeen launches into the story.|$|E
5000|$|In his 2003 paper, [...] "Human Genetic Diversity: Lewontin's Fallacy", A. W. F. Edwards {{argued that}} rather than using a locus-by-locus {{analysis}} of variation to derive taxonomy, {{it is possible to}} construct a human classification system based on characteristic genetic patterns, or clusters inferred from multilocus genetic data. Geographically based human studies since have shown that such genetic clusters can be derived from analyzing {{of a large number of}} loci which can assort individuals sampled into groups analogous to traditional continental racial groups. Joanna Mountain and Neil Risch cautioned that while genetic clusters may one day be shown to correspond to phenotypic variations between groups, such assumptions were premature as the relationship between genes and complex traits remains poorly understood. However, Risch denied such limitations render the analysis useless: [...] "Perhaps just using someone's actual birth year is not a very good way of measuring age. Does that mean we should throw it out? ... Any category you <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>is</b> going to be imperfect, but that doesn't preclude you from using it or the fact that it has utility." ...|$|E
5000|$|Josh Klausner, one of {{the writers}} of Shrek Forever After, {{explained}} in 2010 the script's evolution: [...] "When I first came onto the project, it wasn't {{supposed to be the}} final chapter — there were originally going to be 5 Shrek movies. Then, about a year into the development, Jeffrey Katzenberg decided that the story that we'd <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>was</b> the right way for Shrek's journey to end." ...|$|R

5000|$|Reviewing {{the world}} premiere, Mark Swed of the Los Angeles Times called it [...] "a sonically {{spectacular}} concerto for organ and orchestra" [...] and wrote, [...] "What MacMillan has <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>is</b> a two-part, quirkily animated concerto. His bumptious bestiary is just that, a musical book of fanciful animals impersonated by organ and orchestra. In the first part, he introduces 'a cro-magnon hyena' and the 'red-handed, no surrender, howler monkey,' {{as well as}} buzzing bees, lumbering reptiles, the cuckoo. In the second part, he lets them loose." [...] Andrew Achenbach of Gramophone similarly described it as [...] "a caustic, loopy and exhilarating showpiece for organ and orchestra." [...] Stephen Johnson of BBC Music Magazine observed, [...] "...while the Concerto has its moments of spellbound celebration, like the strings' imitation of improvised Gallic psalm-singing (one of the loveliest things in all folk music) in the central slow movement, A Scotch Bestiary is full of a black vitality which always threatens to explode into pure chaos. Some of MacMillan's targets - indicated in titles like 'The red-handed, no-surrender, howler monkey' and 'Scottish Patriots' - are easy to identify. Others, as the work's subtitle implies ('Enigmatic variations on a zoological carnival at a Caledoninan exhibition'), are more elusive to outsiders, but even then the acrid caricature remains wickedly entertaining." ...|$|E
