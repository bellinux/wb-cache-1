40|$|AbstractA core {{mission of}} the U. S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Carbon Sequestration Program is to foster the {{development}} of commercially-ready technologies for CO 2 capture and sequestration. An R&D program goal of 90 % carbon capture, at {{an increase in the}} cost of electricity (<b>COE)</b> <b>no</b> greater than 10 % above current state-of-the-art designs without capture, has been established for electric power generation from next-generation Integrated-Gasification Combined-Cycle (IGCC) plants. Advanced gas separation membranes for separating H 2 from CO 2 are one possible technology for achieving these goals. For IGCC CO 2 -capture applications, membranes will need to out-perform existing chemical and physical absorption processes. Gas separation membranes, however, can be integrated into a number of different locations in the IGCC process in addition to post water-gas-shift (WGS), the preferred location for current absorption technologies. Due to the many integration options possible, membranes could potentially be required to operate over a wide range of conditions. It is preferred that the membrane operate at pressures and temperatures normally encountered at that point in the IGCC flowsheet where it is being placed. And, clearly it is beneficial that the membrane be placed in a location with relatively high pressure in order to maximize separation. If this is possible, the feed and product gases need not be compressed/expanded or heated/cooled. In addition, membrane materials being considered, whether ceramic, metallic or polymeric, have physical and chemical limitations in regards to operating temperature and tolerance to various compounds that might be present in synthesis gas. It is therefore unlikely that one type of membrane will be able to perform over the entire range of conditions possible. In this paper, we identify preferred membrane locations and quantify performance requirements {{for a wide range of}} membrane materials currently under consideration for H 2 /CO 2 separation...|$|E
40|$|Proceedings of the 1993 Georgia Water Resources Conference, April 20 - 21, 1993, Athens, Georgia. The Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (WRDA 86), Public Law 99 - 662, {{established}} {{new rules}} for the cost sharing of Federally authorized water resources projects. For the first time, sponsors are required {{to share in the}} cost of feasibility studies to ensure that dwindling Federal dollars are spent wisely with priority to those projects with strong sponsor support. Sponsors are also required to pay a share of the Planning, Engineering, and Design (PED) and project construction costs in addition to the traditional costs for lands, easements and rights-of way. With the passage of WRDA 86, the roles and responsibilities of both the Corps of Engineers (CoE) and the non-Federal sponsors changed radically. The <b>CoE</b> (<b>no</b> longer a sole benefactor) and the non-Federal sponsor (no longer a passive recipient) became partners in the development of water resources projects. This partnership brings along increased financial responsibilities to the non-Federal sponsor and increased management responsibilities to the CoE. The Project Cooperation Agreement (PCA), formerly LCA, details the responsibilities of all parties involved in project development. An important element of the PCA is a financial analysis package to ascertain the non-Federal sponsor's ability to meet financial requirements necessary for project implementation. New cost-sharing requirements under WRDA 86 and the elements of the financial analysis package are the two main topics of this paper. Sponsored and Organized by: U. S.

40|$|Currently, most micrositing {{techniques}} aim {{to maximize}} annual energy production (AEP) or minimize cost of energy (<b>COE)</b> with <b>no</b> direct regard to revenue. This research study developed {{a method that}} utilizes the seasonal electricity price and wind data to microsite wind farms in terms of profitability. To accomplish this, six candidate wind farms with differing layouts and spacing were selected at a given location. They were then simulated using a wake modeling software to produce expected power outputs at different wind speeds, wind directions, and turbulence intensities. By interpolating the power output tables with wind data, a power time-series was created for each wind farm over a multi-year period. Electrical price was then incorporated with the power time-series to produce a revenue time-series of the revenue produced at each hour over the same time-period. Each relative wind farm was then rotated in increments to evaluate new candidate wind farms and revenue totals. This method is site specific and results may differ dependent on location and seasonal correlation between wind and electrical data. Overall, the method looks to exploit {{a different approach to}} the micrositing problem...|$|R

DSBN+, a {{conjugated}} oligoelectrolyte (COE), {{was added}} to microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) to improve hydrogen recovery. The volume of hydrogen gas recovered in a fedbatch cycle of mixed culture MECs increased by 126 × compared to controls (<b>no</b> <b>COE</b> addition), mainly by preventing the loss of hydrogen to methane production. Performance in pure culture MECs fed with Geobacter sulfurreducens increased by factors of 10. 5 in terms of energy yield, 2. 1 in COD removal, and 11. 8 in hydrogen yield. Hydrogen gas recycling was reduced, and the volume of hydrogen gas recovered increased by 6. 5 × compared to controls. Minimal methane production {{and a lack of}} hydrogen gas uptake by G. sulfurreducens suggested that the COEs increased hydrogen recoveries by interfering with hydrogen uptake by hydrogenotrophic methanogens but also by exoelectrogenic bacteria. COEs may therefore be useful for inhibiting the activities of certain hydrogenases, although the mechanism of inhibition needs further investigation...|$|R

40|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{value of}} narrow band imaging (NBI) in the "optical biopsy" of leukoplakias (LP) and erythroplakias (EP) in different oral cavity (OC) and oropharyngeal (OP) subsites {{is still to}} be defined. We evaluated 128 unbiopsied and untreated OC/OP LP and EP by conventional oral examination (COE), white light (WL) endoscopy, and NBI and categorized them as "suspicious" or "innocuous". All lesions were treated by excisional biopsy. True positives were those considered as "suspicious" and with histopathology ranging from mild dysplasia to invasive carcinoma. Epithelia were classified as follows: type 1, keratinized thick stratified (gingiva, hard palate, dorsal tongue); type 2 a, non-keratinized thin stratified (floor of mouth, vestibule, ventral tongue, soft palate, palatine tonsils, base of tongue); type 2 b, non-keratinized, very thick stratified (retromolar trigon, lateral tongue, labial and buccal mucosa). Histopathology revealed 32  % benign lesions, 13  % mild to moderate dysplasias, 15  % severe dysplasias/carcinoma in situ, 16  % microinvasive, and 23  % invasive carcinomas. The false positive rates were 32  % at COE, 27  % at WL, and 15  % at NBI. The false negative rates were 49, 22, and 11  %, respectively. Diagnositic performance was higher for NBI compared to COE (p <  0. 001) and to WL (p =  0. 004). Comparison of the diagnostic value of NBI among different OC/OP subsites did not show statistically significant difference. NBI as an "optical biopsy" tool significantly reduces the rates of false positives and false negatives in diagnosis of OC/OP cancer compared with <b>COE</b> and WL. <b>No</b> statistically significant difference was noted in its diagnostic value among different OC/OP subsites...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a revised}} and {{extended}} version of “Compilation of Agricultural Production Data for India and Pakistan Areas, c. 1900 - 1990,” <b>COE</b> Discussion Paper <b>No.</b> D 99 - 24, February 2000, Hitotsubashi University. This paper presents estimates for agricultural production data in areas currently in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh from 1901 / 02 to 2001 / 02. A salient feature of these estimates {{is that they}} correspond to current international borders. The British Empire of India, which was broken up in 1947 (in the so-called “Partition” of the Indian subcontinent), covered areas of what are now India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Although a rich accumulation of statistical documents {{is available from the}} colonial period, there has been no rigorous attempt to compile statistics corresponding to the current borders during a period that includes years prior to 1947. This is because the Partition broke up the Empire of India not only at the provincial level (for which data are readily available) but also at the district or lower levels of administration. This paper is an attempt to fill this gap, focusing on production in crop farming in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Since neither the states of Pakistan and Bangladesh nor the concept of such nations existed during {{the early decades of the}} twentieth century, this exercise is hypothetical to some extent. Nevertheless, because farming activities are carried out on the soil of a region irrespective of its political designation, the estimates presented in this paper could shed new light on agricultural development in the three countries over the long term. グローバルCOEプログラム = Global COE Progra...|$|R

40|$|The {{partners}} in BioExcel {{are engaged in}} numerous projects, {{many of which have}} strong connections to the centre’s activities. The three core codes have been in development for many years and have been supported by many different projects over this time. It is the case however, that many of these funding streams are focused on specific scientific applications as opposed to other equally important aspects of research software development. Funding from proposals is necessary to support activities related to BioExcel, but individual projects alone cannot fully address the remit of the CoE, namely preparation for Exascale, improvements to software development processes, extensive support to the community and engaging with industry. BioExcel will support world leading European software whose development is funded through multiple sources. A CoE is needed to integrate these efforts into a coherent approach to maintain European leadership. If there was <b>no</b> <b>CoE,</b> the community would fragment and there would be a real risk that individual efforts would benefit only a subset of the user community. BioExcel is in a good position to support work related to the codes that other funding sources do not support directly, such as helping to prepare for Exascale, community building, and to help to provide continuity for code developers as they move between different funding streams. This document offers examples of project proposals that BioExcel has been involved in, and projects or initiatives that are already underway. These are classified as either focused on the project’s core codes or related to BioExcel’s activities on workflows and data integration. Examples include proposals for specific code enhancements, such as the GROMEX bid, and involvement in larger proposals such as the EGI/EUDAT/INDIGO: European Open Science Cloud proposal, in which the HADDOCK web portal has been included as a thematic service. In terms of workflows, there are several large projects that involve multiple BioExcel {{partners in}}cluding the ELIXIR Interoperability Platform, Multiscale Complex Genomics VRE and WestLife VRE. BioExcel partners are also involved in key development work with Open PHACTS and KNIME. Industry-related activities to date have focused around the establishment of the Interest Group, “Practical Applications for Industry”, which now has 30 signed up members from 23 companies. Work to explore future business models and sustainability plans is well underway in WP 5. Whilst it is not yet known exactly what the balance of future funding for the centre will look like, it is clear that whatever the future funding model for the CoE, it is unlikely that any single line of public funding would fully sustain the work of the centre. It is therefore expected that BioExcel will continue to explore options to apply for funding from multiple sources, and this work has begun under the auspices of Task 3. 6. Core BioExcel funding will provide continuity and stability, and serve to multiply the impact of the individual projects which could be, at least partially, coordinated by the CoE...|$|R
