5|$|Alternative views {{have been}} {{expressed}} that the amendments were not seeking {{to replace the}} <b>common</b> <b>law</b> of judicial review. Instead, they borrowed from the <b>common</b> <b>law</b> by turning the clock back, and merely clarified the limits of judicial power {{in relation to the}} ISA. It has also been noted that the amendments do not compel the application of Lee Mau Seng, a High Court decision. If Lee Mau Seng is wrong, the Court of Appeal can still overrule it now.|$|E
5|$|As Singapore is a <b>common</b> <b>law</b> jurisdiction, {{judgments}} {{handed down}} by the courts are considered a source of law. Judgments may interpret statutes or subsidiary legislation, or develop principles of <b>common</b> <b>law</b> and equity laid down, not by the legislature, but by previous generations of judges. Major portions of Singapore law, particularly contract law, equity and trust law, property law and tort law, are largely judge-made, though certain aspects have now been modified to some extent by statutes.|$|E

5|$|During the 15th century, the <b>common</b> <b>law</b> {{courts were}} {{challenged}} by the civil law and equity found in the Chancery and similar courts. These courts and legal methods were much faster than the <b>common</b> <b>law</b> courts, so lawyers and claimants flocked to them. This was perceived {{as a threat to}} the <b>common</b> <b>law</b> courts, for good reason; between 1460 and 1540, the business of the <b>common</b> <b>law</b> courts significantly dropped, while the Chancery's cases rose massively in number. In reaction to this, the Court of King's Bench developed its own, faster system, intent on winning cases back, and through procedures such as the Writ of Quominus and Bill of Middlesex acquired a wider jurisdiction. While this succeeded in forming an equilibrium between the old <b>common</b> <b>law</b> courts and the new courts, it was viewed with suspicion by the Common Pleas, who became highly reactionary to the changes the King's Bench attempted to introduce. When the King's Bench attempted to use the Bill of Middlesex to widen its jurisdiction, the Common Pleas became increasingly conservative in its attempts to avoid ceding cases. This was limited by the fact that the three Common Pleas prothonotaries could not agree on how to cut costs, leaving the court both expensive and of limited malleability while the King's Bench became faster, cheaper and more varied in its jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|Lim Chin Leng has {{opined that}} Taw Cheng Kong stands as {{authority}} for {{the proposition that the}} Singapore courts will apply in domestic law the rules and principles of public international law that have previously been received into the <b>common</b> <b>law.</b> The Court of Appeal recognized a rule of customary international law that had been received into the <b>common</b> <b>law,</b> that is, the presumption against extraterritoriality, and ascribed to Parliament the intent to uphold that rule for the purposes of construing a statutory provision.|$|E

5|$|The Chancery came to {{prominence}} after {{the decline of}} the Exchequer, dealing with the law of equity, something more fluid and adaptable than the <b>common</b> <b>law.</b> The early Court of Chancery dealt with verbal contracts, matters of land law and matters of trusts, and had a very liberal view when setting aside complaints; poverty, for example, was an acceptable reason to cancel a contract or obligation. Complaints were normally brought via a bill or petition, which had to show that the <b>common</b> <b>law</b> did not provide a remedy for the problem. The Chancery writs were in French, and later English, rather than the Latin used for <b>common</b> <b>law</b> bills. In the reign of Edward III, the Court found a fixed home at Westminster Hall, where it sat almost continually until its dissolution. Before this, justice was difficult to dispose because the Lord Chancellor had to travel with the King wherever he went.|$|E
5|$|The Chief Justice of the Common Pleas was {{the head}} of the Court of Common Pleas, also known as the Common Bench or Common Place, which was the second-highest <b>common</b> <b>law</b> court in the English legal system until 1875, when it, along with the other two <b>common</b> <b>law</b> courts and the equity and probate courts, became part of the High Court of Justice. As such, the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas was one of the highest {{judicial}} officials in England, behind only the Lord High Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice of England, who headed the Queen's Bench (King's when the monarch was male).|$|E
5|$|The Stewart dynasty, {{founded by}} King Robert II in 1371, {{was defined by}} the growing {{authority}} {{and power of the}} Scottish Kings in matters of law and the development of existing legal institutions. In 1469, the parliament of Scotland affirmed the ultimate authority of James III and rejected the authority of imperial notaries in Scottish civil matters. The recognition of the sovereign authority of the Scottish Kings was connected to the influence of the <b>common</b> <b>law</b> in Scots law. Customary laws, such as the Law of Clan MacDuff, came under attack from the Stewart Dynasty, which consequently extended the reach of Scots <b>common</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{main focus}} of the Exchequer was the {{collection}} of royal revenue {{as part of the}} greater Exchequer, which was officially undertaken by the Lord High Treasurer. The Exchequer was unique in having jurisdiction in matters of both equity and the <b>common</b> <b>law,</b> the latter initially curtailed after the Magna Carta and reserved for the Court of King's Bench and Court of Common Pleas, although it later grew back. This process of <b>common</b> <b>law</b> and equity was reversed; during the 16th century the Exchequer was solely a <b>common</b> <b>law</b> body, with the equity jurisdiction only again becoming relevant {{near the end of the}} Tudor period. W. H. Bryson argues that this happened during the reign of Edward I. By 1590 the Exchequer's jurisdiction over equity cases was confirmed, and it was handling a significant number a year, including disputes over trusts, mortgages, tithes and copyholds; since taxation was ever-present, it was not difficult to show that the dispute prevented the payment of a debt to the monarch, allowing the Writ of Quominus.|$|E

5|$|Tracing {{is divided}} into two forms, <b>common</b> <b>law</b> tracing and {{equitable}} tracing. <b>Common</b> <b>law</b> tracing relies on the claimant having legal ownership of the property, and will fail if the property has been mixed with other property, the legal title has been transferred to the defendant, or the legal title has been transferred by the defendant to any further recipient of the property. Equitable tracing, on the other hand, relies on the claimant having an equitable interest in the property, and can succeed where the property has been mixed with other property.|$|E

The ius gentium ("law of peoples") was {{the body of}} <b>common</b> <b>laws</b> that applied to foreigners, and their dealings with Roman citizens.

5|$|After the Chancery Regulation Act 1862 {{had gone}} some way toward {{procedural}} reform, in February 1867, Roundell Palmer again brought {{the problem of}} having two separate court systems to Parliament's attention, and in March 1870 Lord Hatherley introduced a bill to create a single, unified High Court of Justice. The bill was a weak one, not containing any provision addressing which court would deal with the <b>common</b> <b>law</b> and which with equity, and was also silent {{on the structure of}} the court, as Hatherley believed the difference between the <b>common</b> <b>law</b> and equity was one of procedure, not substance. As a result, the bill was heavily opposed from two sides: those who opposed fusion, and those who supported fusion but felt the provisions were too weak and vague to be of any use. As a result, the bill was eventually withdrawn.|$|E

Praetor Urbanus) were the people who had jurisdiction over cases involving citizens. The Ius Gentium ("Law of nations") was the body of <b>common</b> <b>laws</b> that applied to foreigners, and their dealings with Roman citizens. The Praetores Peregrini (sg. Praetor Peregrinus) were the people who had jurisdiction over cases involving citizens and foreigners. Ius Naturale encompassed natural law, the body of laws that were considered common to all beings.|$|R

What would be murder if the officer had the right to arrest might be reduced to manslaughter by the very fact that he had no such right. So an officer, at <b>common</b> <b>law,</b> was not authorized to make an arrest without a warrant, for a mere misdemeanor not committed in his presence.|$|E
