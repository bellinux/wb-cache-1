Sea salt aerosols influence the sulfate aerosol formation in different ways due to the different sizes. Very small sea salt aerosols, which are below the <b>critical</b> <b>diameter</b> for droplet activation at low supersaturations, can serve as nuclei for the growth of sulfate particles, while larger sea salt particles serve as a sink for gaseous hydrogen sulfate (H2SO4) molecules, reducing the amount of sulfate available for the formation of accumulation mode particles.|$|E

5000|$|Experimentally, it is {{observed}} that though the magnitude of the magnetization is uniform throughout a homogeneous specimen at uniform temperature, the direction of the magnetization is in general not uniform, but varies from one region to another, on a scale corresponding to visual observations with a microscope. Uniform of direction is attained only by applying a field, or by choosing as a specimen, a body which is itself of microscopic dimensions (a fine particle). The size range for which a ferromagnet become single-domain is generally quite narrow and a first quantitative result in this direction is due to William Fuller Brown, Jr. who, in his fundamental paper, rigorously proved (in the framework of Micromagnetics), though in the special case of a homogeneous sphere of radius , what nowadays is known as Brown’s fundamental theorem of the theory of fine ferromagnetic particles. This theorem states the existence of a critical radius [...] such that the state of lowest free energy is one of uniform magnetization if [...] (i.e. the existence of a critical size under which spherical ferromagnetic particles stay uniformly magnetized in zero applied field). A lower bound for [...] can then be computed. In 1988, Amikam A.
