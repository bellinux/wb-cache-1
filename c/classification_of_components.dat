40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} various <b>classifications</b> <b>of</b> <b>component</b> interoperability errors. These classifications aim at {{supporting the}} automation <b>of</b> <b>component</b> adaptation. The use <b>of</b> software <b>components</b> will only demonstrate beneficial, if the costs for component deployment (i. e., acquisition and composition) are considerably {{lower than those}} for custom <b>component</b> development. One <b>of</b> {{the main reasons for}} the moderate progress in component-based software engineering are the high costs for component deployment. These costs are mainly caused by adapting components to bridge interoperability errors between unfitting components. One way to lower the costs <b>of</b> <b>component</b> deployment is to support component adaptation by tools, i. e., for interoperability checks of (semi-) automated adaptor generation. This automation <b>of</b> <b>component</b> adaptation requires a deep understanding <b>of</b> <b>component</b> interoperability errors. In particular, one has to differentiate between different classes of interoperability errors, as different errors require different adaptors for resolving. Therefore, the presented <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>component</b> interoperability errors supports the automation <b>of</b> <b>component</b> adaptation by aiding automated interoperability problem detection and semi-automated adaptor generation. The experience gained from already implemented solutions for a specific class of interoperability errors provides hints for the solution of similar problems of the same class. ...|$|R
