30|$|Marasmiaceae species {{also have}} two {{different}} types of laccases in <b>sensu</b> <b>stricto</b> subfamily 2. One is a group including Lcc 12 and the other is a group including Lcc 9, Lcc 13 and Lcc 14. Interestingly, laccase <b>sensu</b> <b>stricto</b> subfamily 2 is generally conserved in limited species of the Agaricales, such as L. edodes, F. velutipes, C. cinerea, A. bisporus and P. ostreatus (Fig.  1). There is little information on laccase <b>sensu</b> <b>stricto</b> subfamily 2 in L. edodes. Furthermore, enzymatic characteristics and biological functions of laccases in this subfamily have not been well characterized. lcc 13 is transcribed fairly abundantly in sawdust medium (Fig.  4) and Lcc 13 secreted into the medium (Additional file 1 : Figure S 2). Three of four laccases in <b>sensu</b> <b>stricto</b> subfamily 2 in L. edodes are transcribed in mycelia and have a signal peptide for secretion; therefore, laccases in <b>sensu</b> <b>stricto</b> subfamily 2 are likely to function as extracellular enzymes for lignin degradation.|$|R
40|$|Restriction {{fragment}} length polymorphism (RFLP) {{analysis of}} the outer surface protein C (ospC) gene amplicon was used for rapid screening for genetic variability within Borrelia burgdorferi <b>sensu</b> <b>stricto</b> species and for detection of multiple borreliae in culture. Primers for the ospC gene amplified a fragment of about 600 bp from Borrelia cultures. After cleavage of the amplified products by MboI and DraI, eight different RFLP types were found among 13 B. burgdorferi <b>sensu</b> <b>stricto</b> strains from various sources and geographical areas, and three RFLP types were found among 10 representative isolates from skin biopsy specimens taken from patients residing on {{the eastern end of}} Long Island, New York (B. W. Berger, R. C. Johnson, C. Kodner, and L. Coleman, J. Clin. Microbiol. 30 : 359 - 361, 1992). These results suggested that the DNA organization of B. burgdorferi <b>sensu</b> <b>stricto</b> is heterogeneous not only globally but also within a localized geographical area and that the ospC-based typing approach could differentiate the B. burgdorferi <b>sensu</b> <b>stricto.</b> From the results obtained using mixed cultures of two different RFLP types of B. burgdorferi <b>sensu</b> <b>stricto,</b> contamination of at least 0. 5 % of different types of Borrelia cells in culture could be detected. This method could detect a multiple-B. burgdorferi <b>sensu</b> <b>stricto</b> infection in the bladders of mice experimentally infected with two different RFLP type strains. The present study showed that RFLP analysis of ospC-PCR products is a reliable method for epidemiological typing of B. burgdorferi <b>sensu</b> <b>stricto</b> and could be used for rapid detection of mixed Borrelia culture and multiple B. burgdorferi <b>sensu</b> <b>stricto</b> infections in animals, ticks, and patients...|$|R
30|$|The edible {{white rot}} fungus Lentinula edodes {{possesses}} {{a variety of}} lignin degrading enzymes such as manganese peroxidases and laccases. Laccases belong to the multicopper oxidases, which have {{a wide range of}} catalytic activities including polyphenol degradation and synthesis, lignin degradation, and melanin formation. The exact number of laccases in L. edodes is unknown, as are their complete properties and biological functions. We analyzed the draft genome sequence of L. edodes D 703 PP- 9 and identified 13 multicopper oxidase-encoding genes; 11 laccases in <b>sensu</b> <b>stricto,</b> of which three are new, and two ferroxidases. lcc 8, a laccase previously reported in L. edodes, was not identified in D 703 PP- 9 genome. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the 13 multicopper oxidases can be classified into laccase <b>sensu</b> <b>stricto</b> subfamily 1, laccase <b>sensu</b> <b>stricto</b> subfamily 2 and ferroxidases. From sequence similarities and expression patterns, laccase <b>sensu</b> <b>stricto</b> subfamily 1 can be divided into two subgroups. Laccase <b>sensu</b> <b>stricto</b> subfamily 1 group A members are mainly secreted from mycelia, while laccase <b>sensu</b> <b>stricto</b> subfamily 1 group B members are expressed mainly in fruiting bodies during growth or after harvesting but are lowly expressed in mycelia. Laccase <b>sensu</b> <b>stricto</b> subfamily 2 members are mainly expressed in mycelia, and two ferroxidases are mainly expressed in the fruiting body during growth or after harvesting, and are expressed at very low levels in mycelium. Our data suggests that L. edodes laccases in same group share expression patterns and would have common biological functions.|$|R

We investigated the distribution of C. parapsilosis complex species in 122 isolates from blood and other sources in a southern Spain tertiary-care hospital, and we {{examined the relationship between}} species, site of isolation and biofilm positivity. We also evaluated the planktonic MICs and sessile MICs (SMICs) of voriconazole, amphotericin B and anidulafungin. One hundred and eleven isolates (91 %) were categorized as C. parapsilosis <b>sensu</b> <b>stricto,</b> whereas ten isolates (8. 2 %) were categorized as C. orthopsilosis and one (0. 8 %) as C. metapsilosis. Biofilm positivity was observed in 58. 5 % (65 of 111) of C. parapsilosis <b>sensu</b> <b>stricto</b> isolates vs. 0 % (0 of 11) of C. orthopsilosis and C. metapsilosis isolates (p < 0. 01). There was no difference in biofilm production among C. parapsilosis <b>sensu</b> <b>stricto</b> isolates from blood and other sources. MIC values showed that all isolates were susceptible to voriconazole and amphotericin B, whereas two isolates (1. 8 %) of C. parapsilosis <b>sensu</b> <b>stricto</b> were non-susceptible to anidulafungin. However, the MIC 90 value of voriconazole was higher (0. 125 mg/L) for C. orthopsilosis than for C. parapsilosis <b>sensu</b> <b>stricto</b> (0. 03 mg/L). In contrast to planktonic cells, the SMICs show that amphotericin B and anidulafungin are moderately effective against the biofilm of C. parapsilosis <b>sensu</b> <b>stricto,</b> whereas voriconazole is ineffective...|$|R
