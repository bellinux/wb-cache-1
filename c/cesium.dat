5|$|European studies {{conducted}} after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster {{have shown that}} the fruit bodies have a high rate of accumulation of the radioactive isotope <b>cesium.</b>|$|E
5|$|The International System of Units {{standardized}} its unit of time, the second, on {{the properties}} of <b>cesium</b> in 1967. SI defines the second as 9,192,631,770 cycles of the radiation which corresponds to the transition between two electron spin energy levels of the ground state of the 133Cs atom. The <b>cesium</b> atomic clock, maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, is accurate to 30billionths of a second per year. Atomic clocks have employed other elements, such as hydrogen and rubidium vapor, offering greater stability—in the case of hydrogen clocks—and smaller size, lower power consumption, and thus lower cost (in the case of rubidium clocks).|$|E
5|$|Caesium {{fluoride}} or <b>cesium</b> fluoride is an {{inorganic compound}} usually encountered as a hygroscopic white solid. It {{is used in}} organic synthesis {{as a source of}} the fluoride anion. Caesium has the highest electropositivity of all non-radioactive elements and fluorine has the highest electronegativity of all elements.|$|E
5|$|The Beckman team {{eventually}} developed additional models, {{as well as}} {{a number}} of accessories or attachments which could be used to modify the DU for different types of work. One of the first accessories was a flame attachment with a more powerful photo multiplier to enable the user to examine flames such as potassium, sodium and <b>cesium</b> (1947).|$|E
5|$|The {{radio signals}} of WWV, WWVB and WWVH, {{along with the}} 4 atomic (<b>cesium)</b> clocks that their time signals derive from, are {{maintained}} by NIST's Time and Frequency Division, {{which is based in}} nearby Boulder, Colorado. The Time and Frequency Division is part of the NIST's Physics Laboratory, based in Gaithersburg, Maryland. NIST's predecessor, the National Bureau of Standards, previously maintained WWV {{as a part of the}} Department of Agriculture; NIST is currently part of the Department of Commerce.|$|E
5|$|An {{academic}} career required a doctorate, so in 1921 Urey {{enrolled in a}} PhD program at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied thermodynamics under Gilbert N. Lewis. His initial attempt at a thesis was on the ionization of <b>cesium</b> vapor. He ran into difficulties, and an Indian physicist published a better paper on the same subject. Urey then wrote his thesis on the ionization states of an ideal gas, which was subsequently published in the Astrophysical Journal. After he received his PhD in 1923, Urey was awarded a fellowship by the American-Scandinavian Foundation to study at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen, where he met Werner Heisenberg, Hans Kramers, Wolfgang Pauli, Georg von Hevesy, and John Slater. At the conclusion of his stay, he traveled to Germany, where he met Albert Einstein and James Franck.|$|E
5|$|Optical {{heterodyne}} detection {{is an essential}} technique used in high-accuracy measurements of the frequencies of optical sources, {{as well as in}} the stabilization of their frequencies. Until a relatively few years ago, lengthy frequency chains were needed to connect the microwave frequency of a <b>cesium</b> or other atomic time source to optical frequencies. At each step of the chain, a frequency multiplier would be used to produce a harmonic of the frequency of that step, which would be compared by {{heterodyne detection}} with the next step (the output of a microwave source, far infrared laser, infrared laser, or visible laser). Each measurement of a single spectral line required several years of effort in the construction of a custom frequency chain. Currently, optical frequency combs have provided a much simpler method of measuring optical frequencies. If a mode-locked laser is modulated to form a train of pulses, its spectrum is seen to consist of the carrier frequency surrounded by a closely spaced comb of optical sideband frequencies with a spacing equal to the pulse repetition frequency (Fig.16). The pulse repetition frequency is locked to that of the frequency standard, and the frequencies of the comb elements at the red end of the spectrum are doubled and heterodyned with the frequencies of the comb elements at the blue end of the spectrum, thus allowing the comb to serve as its own reference. In this manner, locking of the frequency comb output to an atomic standard can be performed in a single step. To measure an unknown frequency, the frequency comb output is dispersed into a spectrum. The unknown frequency is overlapped with the appropriate spectral segment of the comb and the frequency of the resultant heterodyne beats is measured.|$|E
25|$|As of October 2012, regular {{sampling}} {{of fish and}} other sea life {{off the coast of}} Fukushima showed that total <b>cesium</b> levels in bottom-dwelling fish were higher off Fukushima than elsewhere, with levels above regulatory limits, leading to a fishing ban for some species. <b>Cesium</b> levels had not decreased 1 year after the accident.|$|E
25|$|TEPCO {{began the}} (test) {{operation}} of SARRY, {{which is the}} second <b>cesium</b> adsorption apparatus (TOSHIBA).|$|E
25|$|TEPCO {{began the}} {{operation}} of the <b>cesium</b> adsorption apparatus (Kurion) and the decontamination apparatus (AREVA).|$|E
25|$|High {{levels of}} {{radioactive}} <b>cesium</b> {{were found in}} 23 varieties of freshwater fish sampled at five rivers and lakes in Fukushima Prefecture between December 2011 and February 2012 and in 8 locations on the open sea. On 2 July 2012 the Ministry of the Environment published that it had found radioactive <b>cesium</b> between 61 and 2,600 becquerels per kilogram. 2,600 becquerels were found {{in a kind of}} goby caught in Mano River, which flows from Iitate Village to the city of Minamisoma, north of the nuclear plant. Water bugs, common food for freshwater fish, also showed high levels of 330 to 670 becquerels per kilogram. Marine fish was found less contaminated and showed levels between 2.15 and 260 Bq/kg. Marine fish might be more capable of excreting <b>cesium</b> from their bodies, because saltwater fish have the ability to excrete salt. The Japanese Ministry of the Environment would closely monitor freshwater fish as radioactive <b>cesium</b> might remain for much longer periods in their bodies. According to Japanese regulations, food is considered safe for consumption up to a maximum of 100 Bq/kg.|$|E
25|$|On 16 November 630 becquerels per {{kilogram}} {{of radioactive}} <b>cesium</b> was detected in rice harvested in the Oonami district in Fukushima City.|$|E
25|$|It was {{reported}} that radioactive iodine was detected in the tap water in Fukushima, Tochigi, Gunma, Tokyo, Chiba, Saitama, and Niigata, and radioactive <b>cesium</b> in the tap water in Fukushima, Tochigi and Gunma. Radioactive <b>cesium,</b> iodine, and strontium were also detected in the soil in some places in Fukushima. There may be a need to replace the contaminated soil. Many radioactive hotspots were found outside the evacuation zone, including Tokyo. Food products were also found contaminated by radioactive matter in several places in Japan. On 5 April 2011, {{the government of the}} Ibaraki Prefecture banned the fishing of sand lance after discovering that this species was contaminated by radioactive <b>cesium</b> above legal limits. As late as July 2013 slightly elevated levels of radioactivity were found in beef on sale at Tokyo markets.|$|E
25|$|On 22 December 2011 the Japanese {{government}} announced new limits for radioactive <b>cesium</b> in food. The new norms would be enforced in April 2012.|$|E
25|$|On 21 February 2013 a greenling - 38 centimeters {{long and}} {{weighing}} 564grams - was caught near a water intake of the reactor units. It did {{set a new}} record: containing 740,000 becquerels radioactive <b>cesium</b> per kilogram, 7,400 times the Japanese limit deemed safe for human consumption. The previous record of <b>cesium</b> concentration in fish was 510,000 Bq/kg detected in another greenling. On the sea floor a net was installed by TEPCO, {{in order to prevent}} migrating fish to escape from the contaminated area.|$|E
25|$|On 31 March 2012 the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan {{published}} {{a report on}} radioactive <b>cesium</b> found in food. Between January and around 15 March 2012 at 421 occasions food was found containing more than 100 becquerels per kilogram <b>cesium.</b> All was found within 8 prefectures: Chiba, Fukushima Prefecture (285 finds), Gunma, Ibaraki (36 finds), Iwate, Miyagi, Tochigi (29 finds) and Yamagata. Most times it involved fish: landlocked salmon and flounder, seafood, after this: Shiitake-mushrooms or the meat of wild animals.|$|E
25|$|All rice of {{the fields}} nearby was stored and none of this rice had been sold to the market. On 18 November all 154 farmers in the {{district}} were asked to suspend all shipments of rice. Tests were ordered on rice samples from all 154 farms in the district. The result of this testing was reported on 25 November: five more farms were found with <b>cesium</b> contaminated rice {{at a distance of}} 56kilometers from the disaster reactors in the Oonami district of Fukushima City, The highest level of <b>cesium</b> detected was 1,270 becquerels per kilogram.|$|E
25|$|On 13 October 2011 {{the city}} of Yokohama {{terminated}} the use of dried shiitake-mushrooms in school lunches after tests had found radioactive <b>cesium</b> in them up to 350 becquerels per kilogram. In shiitake mushrooms grown outdoors on wood in a city in the prefecture Ibaraki, 170kilometers from the nuclear plant, samples contained 830 becquerels per kilogram of radioactive <b>cesium,</b> exceeding the government's limit of 500 becquerels. Radioactive contaminated shiitake mushrooms, above 500 becquerels per kilogram, were also found in two cities of prefecture Chiba, therefore restrictions were imposed on the shipments from these cities.|$|E
25|$|On 28 March 2012 smelt {{caught in}} the Akagi Onuma lake {{near the city of}} Maebashi in the {{prefecture}} Gunma was found to be contaminated with 426 becquerels per kilogram of <b>cesium.</b>|$|E
25|$|Radioactive <b>cesium</b> {{was found}} in high {{concentration}} in plankton in the sea near the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. Samples were taken up to 60kilometers from the coast of Iwaki city in July 2011 by scientists of the Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology. Up to 669 becquerels per kilogram of radioactive <b>cesium</b> was measured in samples of animal plankton taken 3kilometers offshore. The leader of the research-group Professor Takashi Ishimaru, said that the sea current continuously carried contaminated water southwards from the plant. Further studies {{to determine the effect}} on the food-chain and fish would be needed.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{objections}} from concerned residents {{it became more}} and more difficult to dispose of the ashes of burned household garbage in and around Tokyo. The ashes of waste facilities in the Tohoku, Kanto and Kōshin'etsu regions were proven to be contaminated with radioactive <b>cesium.</b> According to the guidelines of the Ministry of Environment, ashes radiating 8,000 becquerels per kilogram or lower could be buried. Ashes with <b>cesium</b> levels between 8,000 and 100,000 becquerels should be secured, and buried in concrete vessels. A survey was done on 410 sites of waste-disposal facilities, on how the ash disposal was proceeding. At 22 sites, mainly in the Tokyo Metropolitan area, the ashes with levels under 8000 becquerels could not be buried due to the objections of concerned residents. At 42 sites, ashes were found that contained over 8,000 becquerels of <b>cesium,</b> which could not be buried. The ministry made plans to send officials to meetings in the municipalities to explain to the Japanese people that the waste disposal was done safely, and to demonstrate how the disposal of the ashes above 8000 becquerels was conducted.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, {{the company}} entered the mobile phone market by {{launching}} {{a series of}} smartphone models in the market. Archos Titanium, Archos Platinum, Archos Neon, Archos Xenon, Archos <b>Cesium,</b> Archos Oxygen, Archos Helium, and Archos Diamond.|$|E
25|$|In a 'murasoi'-fish (or rock-fish Sebastes pachycephalus) {{caught in}} January 2013 at {{the coast of}} Fukushima an {{enormous}} amount of radioactive <b>cesium</b> was found: 254.000 becquerel/kilogram, or 2540 times the legal limitm in Japan for seafood.|$|E
25|$|TEPCO {{announced}} that extremely {{high levels of}} tritium and <b>cesium</b> were found in a pit containing about 5000 cubic meters water on the sea side of the Unit 2 reactor building. 8.7 MBq/liter of tritium and 2.35 GBq/liter of <b>cesium</b> was measured. The NRA was concerned that leaks from the pit could release high tritium levels into the sea {{and that there was}} still water flowing from the reactor into the turbine building and into the pit. However, TEPCO believed that this pollution was there from the first days in 2011, and had stayed there. Nevertheless, TEPCO would control the site for leaks, and seal the soil around the pit.|$|E
25|$|On 27 July 2013 was {{announced}} that extremely high levels of tritium and <b>cesium</b> were found in a pit containing about 5000 cubic meters water on the seaside of the unit 2 reactor building. 8.7 million becquerels/liter Tritium was found and 2.35 billion becquerels/liter <b>cesium.</b> The NRA was concerned that leaks from this place could cause the high tritium levels in sea, {{and that there was}} still water flowing from the reactor into the turbine building into the pit. But TEPCO thought that this pollution was there from the first days in 2011, and stayed there. Nevertheless, TEPCO would control the site for leaks, and seal the soil around the pit.|$|E
25|$|In August 2012, the Health {{ministry}} {{found that}} <b>cesium</b> levels {{had dropped to}} undetectable levels in most cultivated vegetables from the affected area, while food sourced from forests, rivers or lakes in the Tohoku and northern Kanto regions are showing excessive contamination.|$|E
25|$|For example, the {{biological}} half-life {{of water in}} a human being is about 9 to 10 days, though this can be altered by behavior and various other conditions. The biological half-life of <b>cesium</b> in human beings is between one and four months.|$|E
25|$|The {{intake of}} {{radioactive}} iodine was calculated {{based on the}} radioactive <b>cesium</b> intake and other factors: the airborne iodine-to-cesium ratio on the days that the people worked at the reactor compound and other data. For one worker a reading was found of more than 1,000 millisieverts.|$|E
25|$|These are high-precision {{timekeeping}} {{devices such}} as atomic (<b>cesium,</b> rubidium) clocks, GPS clocks or other radio clocks. They generate a very accurate pulse per second signal that triggers an interrupt and timestamp on a connected computer. Stratum 0 devices are also known as reference clocks.|$|E
25|$|The New York Times {{reported}} the whaling town of Ayukawa, in Ishinomaki, Miyagi Prefecture, was badly {{damaged by the}} 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. After the Fukushima Nuclear Disaster in 2011, radioactive <b>cesium</b> was found in two minke whales caught {{off the coast of}} Hokkaido.|$|E
25|$|Radioactive <b>cesium</b> {{was found}} in waste water {{discharged}} into Tokyo Bay from a cement factory in the prefecture Chiba east of Tokio. In September and October two water samples were taken, measuring 1,103 becquerels per liter and 1,054 becquerels per liter respectively. These were 14 to 15 {{times higher than the}} limit set by NISA. Ash from incinerators in the prefecture constituted the raw material to produce cement. In this process toxic substances are filtered out of the ashes, and the water used to clean these filters was discharged into Tokyo Bay. On 2 November 2011 this waste-water discharge was halted, and the Japanese authorities started a survey on the <b>cesium</b> contamination of the seawater of Tokyo Bay near the plant.|$|E
25|$|The {{degree of}} partial melting is {{critical}} for determining what type of magma is produced. The degree of partial melting required to form a melt can be estimated by considering the relative enrichment of incompatible elements versus compatible elements. Incompatible elements commonly include potassium, barium, <b>cesium,</b> and rubidium.|$|E
25|$|Second {{generation}} {{image intensifiers}} {{use the same}} multialkali photocathode that the first generation tubes used, however by using thicker layers of the same materials, the S25 photocathode was developed, which provides extended red response and reduced blue response, making it more suitable for military applications. It has a typical sensitivity of around 230 µA/lm and a higher quantum efficiency than S20 photocathode material. Oxidation of the <b>cesium</b> to <b>cesium</b> oxide in later versions improved the sensitivity {{in a similar way}} to third generation photocathodes. The same technology that produced the fiber optic bundles that allowed the creation of cascade tubes, allowed, with a slight change in manufacturing, the production of micro-channel plates, or MCPs. The micro-channel plate is a thin glass wafer with a Nichrome electrode on either side across which a large potential difference of up to 1,000 volts is applied.|$|E
25|$|A {{year after}} the disaster, in April 2012, sea fish caught near the Fukushima power plant still contain as much {{radioactive}} 134Cs and 137Cs compared to fish caught {{in the days after}} the disaster. At the end of October 2012 TEPCO admitted that it could not exclude radioactivity releases into the ocean, although the radiation levels were stabilised. Undetected leaks into the ocean from the reactors, could not be ruled out, because their basements remain flooded with cooling water, and the 2,400-foot-long steel and concrete wall between the site’s reactors and the ocean, that should reach 100feet underground, was still under construction, and would not be finished before mid-2014. Around August 2012 two greenling were caught close to the Fukushima shore, they contained more than 25,000 becquerels a kilogram of <b>cesium,</b> the highest <b>cesium</b> levels found in fish since the disaster and 250 times the government’s safety limit.|$|E
25|$|On 10 November 2011 some 120kilometers away {{southwest}} {{from the}} Fukushima-reactors in the prefecture Tochigi 649 becquerels of radioactive <b>cesium</b> per kilogram {{was measured in}} kuritake mushrooms. Four other cities of Tochigi did already stop with the sales and shipments of the mushrooms grown there. The farmers were asked to stop all shipments and to call back the mushrooms already on the market.|$|E
