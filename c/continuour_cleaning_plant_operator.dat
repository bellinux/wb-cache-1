40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if miners were at risk from exposures to chemicals used in the mining industry and determine the nature and sources of the illnesses and injuries. The U. S. Mine Safety and Health Administration s (MSHA) employment and accident, injury and illness database was reviewed. There were 2, 705 cases of chemical-related injuries and illnesses reported from 1999 through 2006, involving 66 different chemicals. The main source (cause) of chemical-related cases was acids/alkalis (about 39 %). The primary nature (effect) of chemical-related cases was chemical burns (about 57 %). The job classification where workers incurred the most chemical-related injuries and illnesses was <b>cleaning</b> <b>plant</b> operator/media operator/boney preparation <b>plant</b> operator/crusher worker (<b>cleaning</b> <b>plant</b> <b>operators</b> are responsible for maintenance of <b>plants,</b> media <b>operators</b> are responsible for handling reagents, boney preparation <b>plant</b> <b>operators</b> oversee removal of bone from coal, and crusher workers use large crushers to break mined material). From 1999 through 2006, the rate of nonfatal days lost and no days lost (resulting from injuries) did not change significantly; however, the rate of illnesses decreased significantly. Chemical burns accounted for a large number of injuries; mining companies should carefully examine their personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements, training methods and safety culture to ensure that their workers are protected...|$|R

40|$|Construction plant {{maintenance}} practice and its <b>plant</b> <b>operators</b> are inextricably linked. This is because, unlike plant operating within the manufacturing sector, construction plant is largely dependent upon operator skill and competence {{to maintain the}} item in a safe, fully operational condition. Research has previously successfully modelled machine breakdown, but revealed that the operator’s impact upon machine breakdown rates can be considerable. A conceptual model methodology with which to assess the maintenance proficiency of individual <b>plant</b> <b>operators</b> is presented. Specifically, an artificial intelligent classification model is proposed {{as a means of}} classifying <b>plant</b> <b>operator</b> maintenance proficiency into one of three bandings. These are good, average and poor. The results of such work will form the basis of new prescriptive guidelines, for incorporation into the new certificate of training achievement (CTA) scheme, available to inexperienced construction <b>plant</b> <b>operators.</b> The paper concludes with an indication of the palpable benefits of such research, to plant owners and the construction industry at large...|$|R

40|$|Master of EducationOn the 25 th September 1998 two <b>plant</b> <b>{{operators}}</b> {{were killed}} and a further eight operators were seriously injured when the Longford Gas Plant exploded and caught on fire. The Royal Commission that followed this disaster identified inadequate operator training and operator incompetence as a significant causal factor that contributed to this disaster. This study investigates the nature of process <b>plant</b> <b>operator</b> competence in the petrochemical industry in the `post Longford' environment. This study used qualitative research methods to study operator competence, specifically document analysis and in-depth interviews with <b>plant</b> <b>operators</b> and training managers. Data from the document analysis and interview transcripts were collected and analysed {{with a view to}} improving understanding of the factors that contribute to operator competence. The findings of this study indicated that operator competence involves formal learning and also informal and tacit knowledge that is learnt in `communities of practice' where experienced operators mentor and guide less experienced members of the shift team. This study suggests that genuine operator competence involves more than just an ability to manage routine duties but also involves an ability to respond effectively during non-routine situations and plant emergencies - these crises have the potential for catastrophic consequences if poorly managed. This study found that there are significant opportunities to improve the training strategies and the organisational support structures to enhance operator competence. This study has made a number of recommendations to improve the competence of petrochemical <b>plant</b> <b>operators.</b> A theoretical model has also been developed to enhance <b>plant</b> <b>operator</b> competence in the petrochemical industry. Suggestions for future research into the area of <b>plant</b> <b>operator</b> competence have been suggested. Restricted Access: Staff and Students of the University Onl...|$|R
