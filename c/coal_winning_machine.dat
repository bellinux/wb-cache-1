So it is necessary that analysis on the failure mechanical reason of guide shoes with the coal-winning machine by the modern mechanics analysis method. The stress diagram of guide shoes could be got by static analysis with MATLAB, and the dangerous parts of the finite element model with guide shoes appeared after loading. Finally, analysis on the fatigue strength and fatigue life of components under various complex condition, which provide some reference theory basis for the future related product designing, Manufacturing and maintenance. Lead Words With the expansion of coal carbon demand for the economy, the development of coal cutters directly affect the coal production and efficiency, which is the most important equipment of coal mine production, and the use efficiency of coal cutters depends on some parts of often failure. In this paper, Guide shoes of MG 500 / 1180 -WD were regarded as the research object Mechanical study by a variety of mechanics method. The stress distribution law of guide shoes was got and guide shoes fatigue stress and fatigue life was calculated. So fatigue damage is the main reason for the damage of guide shoes, which provide certain reference value for <b>coal</b> <b>winning</b> <b>machine</b> on design and maintenance to.

40|$|Discrete dynamic {{programming}} {{is used for}} the development of a computer simulation of armoured semiflexible conveyor (AFC) structures used in modern longwall coal mining. The object of the simulation is the investigation of the vertical steering characteristics of face installations, the potential long-term instability of which is a continuing problem underground. The way in which the AFC structure moulds itself to the undulating floor cut by the <b>coal</b> <b>winning</b> <b>machine</b> (the power-loader) between successive cuts is a crucial factor in the steering behaviour of the entire face system. This, the first of two companion papers, treats the AFC as a chain of loosely coupled piecewise rigid segments (trays) rcsting on a solid coal floor. Such a model is found not to greatly assist the stability of the multipass longwall process. An elastic model is examined in the companion paper.

Colliery companies such as the Butterley Company at Ollerton and the Stanton Company at Thoresby bought the rights.

40|$|AbstractSurface {{coal mining}} technology, {{practice}} {{and development of}} mining systems are introduced since the founding of China. The development of surface coal mining systems can be classified into two stages: shovel-train mining system used as the major mining technology before 1980, combined mining systems have been used since 1980, that is, shovel-truck mining system used as the major overburden removal system and the shovel truck/crusher/conveyor have been utilized as the major <b>coal</b> <b>winning</b> systems. The characteristics of the second stage in area mining methods include outside waste dumping and then gradually inside dumping in the mined out areas. After analyzing the coal occurrences in China, the practice and application of surface mining technology, it is proposed that the attention should {{be paid to the}} problems such as coal haulage system layout design and the reliability improvement of the system of shovel/truck/crusher in the future development of surface coal mining...|$|R
50|$|One {{of the few}} {{surviving}} {{remains of}} the coal industry is Scott's Pit, a fine Cornish-style pumping engine house. Its construction can be dated to about 1823/4. John Scott, {{the owner of the}} colliery, was a London solicitor who had taken a lease of the property in 1816. Coal started to be produced in 1819 and in the same year a locomotive was supplied by George Stephenson, although it did not prove successful and was soon withdrawn. Scott was unable to operate the pit profitably and pulled out in 1828. The pit then reverted to Charles Henry Smith. It continued in use, sometimes for <b>coal</b> <b>winning,</b> sometimes for pumping, until 1930. It was restored in the 1970s. It is often stated that the pit was sunk in the 1770s by a Captain John Scott, but there is no truth in this: it probably derives from a garbled oral tradition.|$|R

40|$|The Hazelwood Mine is an {{open cut}} coal mine, and to {{maintain}} the Mine stability while mining is in progress it is required to carry out depressurisation of two major aquifer systems- Morwell formation aquifer system (M 1) and Traralgon formation aquifer system(M 2).

In the assessment {{and management of the}} environmental impacts due to groundwater extraction from these two major aquifer systems regional groundwater monitoring, ground modelling and reporting has been undertaken. In addition land level monitoring is carried out every 5 years to estimate land subsidence due to groundwater extraction.
