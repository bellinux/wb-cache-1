2500|$|In 1970, Hawking {{postulated}} {{what became}} known as the second law of black hole dynamics, that the event horizon of a black hole <b>can</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> smaller. With James M. Bardeen and Brandon Carter, he proposed the four laws of black hole mechanics, drawing an analogy with thermodynamics. To Hawking's irritation, Jacob Bekenstein, a graduate student of John Wheeler, went further—and ultimately correctly—to apply thermodynamic concepts literally. In the early 1970s, Hawking's work with Carter, Werner Israel and David C. Robinson strongly supported Wheeler's no-hair theorem that no matter what the original material from which a black hole is created, it can be completely described by the properties of mass, electrical charge and rotation. His essay titled [...] "Black Holes" [...] won the Gravity Research Foundation Award in January 1971. Hawking's first book, The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time, written with George Ellis, was published in 1973.|$|E
2500|$|This idea {{of finding}} {{vertices}} adjacent to everything in one subset and nonadjacent to {{everything in a}} second subset {{can be used to}} build up isomorphic copies of any finite or countably infinite graph G, by adding one vertex at a time without backtracking. The extension property can be rephrased as stating that this greedy algorithm <b>can</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> stuck. [...] For, let G'i denote the subgraph of G induced by its first i vertices, and suppose that G'i has already been identified as an induced subgraph of a subset S of the vertices of the Rado graph. Let v be the next vertex of G, let U be the neighbors of v in G'i, and let V be the non-neighbors of v in G'i. If x is a vertex of the Rado graph that is adjacent to every vertex in U and nonadjacent to every vertex in V, then Snbsp&∪nbsp&{x} induces a subgraph isomorphic to G'inbsp&+nbsp&1.|$|E
