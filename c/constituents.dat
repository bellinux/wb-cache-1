40|$|Target date funds (TDFs) appear {{important}} {{in recent years}} because of its inclusion in the Qualified Default Investment Alternatives (QDIAs) in the defined contribution plans. This paper examines the selection of <b>constituent</b> funds, investor externality and possible beneficial “non-performance related flows ” of both target date funds and their <b>constituent</b> funds, and {{the survival of the}} <b>constituent</b> funds. We find that the <b>constituent</b> funds of TDFs exhibit features of weak past performance, low fund flows and high expense ratios, suggesting an adverse cost linked to the selection of <b>constituent</b> funds by TDF managers. Second, outflows from the <b>constituent</b> funds lead to underperformance of the TDFs, but the inclusion in a TDF mitigates the performance-to-outflow sensitivity for the <b>constituent</b> fund itself. Third, the <b>constituent</b> funds with lower investor externality, longer history, and better performance exhibit higher survival probabilities after their inclusion into the TDFs, indicating some extent of monitoring in TDFs. ...|$|R
