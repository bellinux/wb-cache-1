In-town check-in stations of Hong Kong Airlines are located at both Hong Kong and Kowloon Station of the Airport Express Line for passengers to proceed check-in one day before boarding. Moreover, Hong Kong Airlines provides through check-in service. Passengers with flight connections on the following carriers can obtain their boarding passes for their onward flights upon checking in on their departure city.|$|E
25|$|The current {{terminal}} building is largely {{the result of}} extensions designed by Hassell that were completed in 1999. This included construction of a 60-metre roof span above a new column free <b>checkin</b> hall and resulted in extending the terminal footprint to 80,000sqm. There are 14 parking bays served by aerobridges, including two served by dual aerobridges. Terminal 3 features a large Qantas Club lounge, along with a dedicated Business Class and Chairmans lounge. Terminal 3 also has a 'Heritage Collection' located adjacent to gate 13, dedicated to Qantas and including many collections from the airline's 90-plus years of service. It also has {{a view of the}} airport's apron and is used commonly by plane-spotters.|$|E

30|$|In {{terms of}} spatio-temporal {{features}} from Foursquare, we see importance assigned to many features derived from <b>checkins</b> data, like <b>checkins</b> {{in food and}} shops and <b>checkins</b> diversity index. We also see {{that the number of}} afternoon popular venues during the week receives a high weight for the grand larcenies category.|$|R
30|$|We then compute, analog to the {{previous}} section, the fraction of <b>checkins</b> of each category in the area. These {{can be seen as}} measurements of the intensity of the different activity contexts in which the population engages. For instance, an area with many <b>checkins</b> in the Residence category would correspond to a residential neighborhood, which is very different to an entertainment district, that would in turn be characterized by a high number of <b>checkins</b> in the Food, Nightlife Spot, and Shop and Service categories. We proceed by computing the <b>checkins</b> diversity index, as an index of the distribution of human activity within the census tract. It can be seen, that the venues and <b>checkins</b> diversity indexes are the best operationalization of Jacobs’ and Newman’s concept of mixed land use.|$|R

[...] Rather than filling out submission forms online, <b>checkins</b> allow Crowdmap users to expedite data entry to their deployment, focussing first on location and adding more detailed information later. Ushahidi describes the effort as [...] "checkins with a purpose".|$|R
30|$|Defining a venue’s {{stationary}} temporal profile. For {{each of the}} new venues in our set, {{we first}} examine {{the total number of}} <b>checkins</b> at each time step for each week after the venue opened (i.e. the weekly temporal profile). To avoid sparsity issues working at this level of granularity, we create a cumulative temporal profile per week, summing the total number of <b>checkins</b> at each time step with each consecutive week. Although the raw values of cumulative sums have little significance, the trend {{over the course of the}} week represents the characteristic curve of the venue and indicates the weekly demand trend. We normalize the curve for each week by dividing by the sum of all <b>checkins</b> for the venue, up to the time of observation. With each consecutive week, we expect this curve to show a higher degree of stationarity. We measure the stationarity of this temporal profile over time by calculating the variance of the temporal curve at time t relative to time t - 1.|$|R

30|$|The {{collected}} data consists of NYC venues with compact metadata like id, name, location, <b>checkins</b> count (total <b>checkins</b> {{ever done in}} that venue), users count (total users who have ever checked in), associated categories, menu, opening and popular hours, user-generated tips, etc. We have queried the API by searching for venues in the proximity of every incident location described previously, and this resulted into an extensive database of 273, 149 different venues, that have experienced in total over 122 million <b>checkins</b> since their creation on the platform until {{the time of the}} data collection (June 2016). From these, 250, 926 venues have an assigned category. The Foursquare categories span a broad ontology, headed by the following top ten categories: Arts and Entertainment (11, 794 venues), College and University (7082), Event (84), Food (47, 590), Nightlife Spot (11, 140), Outdoors and Recreation (18, 011), Professional and Other Places (64, 055), Residence (14, 632), Shop and Service (62, 627), Travel and Transport (13, 911). The distribution of the top categories across the venues is uneven and biased towards establishments where people go out for services, working, shopping, or dining.|$|R

40|$|Location sharing {{services}} (LSS) like Foursquare, Gowalla, and Facebook Places support {{hundreds of}} millions of userdriven footprints (i. e., “checkins”). Those global-scale footprints provide a unique opportunity to study the social and temporal characteristics of how people use these services and to model patterns of human mobility, which are significant factors for the design of future mobile+location-based services, traffic forecasting, urban planning, as well as epidemiological models of disease spread. In this paper, we investigate 22 million <b>checkins</b> across 220, 000 users and report a quantitative assessment of human mobility patterns by analyzing the spatial, temporal, social, and textual aspects associated with these footprints. We find that: (i) LSS users follow the “Lèvy Flight ” mobility pattern and adopt periodic behaviors; (ii) While geographic and economic constraints affect mobility patterns, so does individual social status; and (iii) Content and sentiment-based analysis of posts associated with <b>checkins</b> can provide a rich source of context for better understanding how users engage with these services. ...|$|R

30|$|We should {{acknowledge}} the geographical (more urban areas) [58] and social bias (younger, more educated, wealthier users) [12] of Foursquare in general, though {{the choice of}} NYC (as the city with most activity on Foursquare) and of the complete aggregated information on venues level (as opposed to incomplete extracts of <b>checkins</b> on users level which are common in literature) are good mitigation approaches. Quantifying such biases would become relevant once comparing different locations [59], but are for now out of scope for this study.|$|R
