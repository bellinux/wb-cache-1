5|$|By {{the early}} 1930s she was {{attending}} art {{classes at the}} Art Students League of New York, and in 1941 she had her first solo exhibition. A student of Hans Hofmann and Chaim Gross, Nevelson experimented with early conceptual art using found objects, and dabbled in painting and printing before dedicating her lifework to sculpture. Usually created out of wood, her sculptures appear puzzle-like, with multiple intricately <b>cut</b> <b>pieces</b> placed into wall sculptures or independently standing pieces, often 3-D. A unique feature of her work is that her figures are often painted in monochromatic black or white. A figure in the international art scene, Nevelson was showcased at the 31st Venice Biennale. Her work is seen in major collections in museums and corporations. Nevelson {{remains one of the}} most important figures in 20th-century American sculpture.|$|E
5|$|BK targets {{specific}} sub-groups {{within the}} adult market. Products like the BK Stacker and BK XXL {{are aimed at}} late teen to young adult males; health-conscious individuals are offered products such as salads, grilled chicken, and veggie burgers. Products such as the BK Veggie, a meatless burger initially introduced in 2002, target the female and health-oriented demographic using a co-branded marketing program and a patty produced by the Kellogg Company's Morningstar Farms division. Another sub-market in this group is on-the-go parents and commuters; The company's BK Chicken Fries—French-fry <b>cut</b> <b>pieces</b> of breaded chicken—is specifically targeted to this segment. First introduced in 2005, the product was successful enough that Burger King expanded the marketing of chicken fries to the children's demographic with a kid's meal version of the product in 2007. The meal was launched with a cross-promotion in conjunction with Nickelodeon's SpongeBob SquarePants. The series of commercials raised the ire of the American Family Association due to perceived nudity concerns.|$|E

25|$|The {{innovative}} {{new techniques}} specially improved tailoring trousers and tights which designs needed more differently <b>cut</b> <b>pieces</b> of cloth than most skirts. “Real” trousers and tights increasingly replaced the prevalent {{use of the}} hose (clothing) which like stockings covered only the legs {{and had to be}} attached with garters to underpants or a doublet. A skirt-like garment to cover the crotch and bottom was no more necessary.

25|$|In {{the first}} {{millennium}} BCE writing tablets were in use in Mesopotamia as well as Syria and Palestine. A carved stone panel dating to between 640-615 BCE that was excavated from the South-West Palace of the Assyrian ruler Sennacherib, at Nineveh in Iraq (British Museum, ME 124955) depicts two figures, one clearly clasping a scroll and the other bearing what {{is thought to be}} an open diptych. Berthe van Regemorter identified a similar figure in the Neo-Hittite Stela of Tarhunpiyas (Musée du Louvre, AO 1922.), dating to the late 8th century BCE, who is seen holding what may be a form of tablature with a unique button closure. Writing tablets of ivory were found in the ruins of Sargon's palace in Nimrud. Margaret Howard surmised that these tablets might have once been connected together using an ingenious hinging system with <b>cut</b> <b>pieces</b> of leather resembling the letter “H” inserted into slots along the edges to form a concertina structure.|$|E

40|$|This is {{a working}} paper. Clothing played an {{important}} role in a number of performance art events during the 1960 s and 1970 s. Performances such as Yoko Ono’s <b>Cut</b> <b>Piece</b> (1964), Marina Abramović’s Rhythm 0 (1974) and Hannah Wilke’s Super-T-Art (1974) implicated the viewer in an embodied relationship with the (un) dressed artist. In these works fabric was variously torn, bound, wrapped, folded and cut off the body. The movement of fabric as it is wrapped and gathered, the sound of cutting clothes away from the body and the charged atmosphere of a potentially violent encounter are all imagined in the photographs that exist of these works. This article explores the relationship between performance and photography in Yoko Ono’s <b>Cut</b> <b>Piece,</b> a performance in which members of the audience cut fragments of clothing away from Ono’s body. Far more than documents that record live events, as if supplementary to the real encounter, these photographs have their own aesthetic, which informs the way we ‘remember’ the performances and understand their significance. Using the dialogue Ono sets up between performance and photography, this article challenges the dominant feminist reading of scopic violence in <b>Cut</b> <b>Piece</b> and considers the work as an event scattered across time...|$|R

25|$|Other items {{brought to}} the altar during the Divine Liturgy include a gold or silver chalice with red wine, a small {{metallic}} urn of warm water, a metallic communion spoon, a little metallic spear, a sponge, a metal disk with <b>cut</b> <b>pieces</b> of bread upon it, and a star, which is a star-shaped piece of metal over which the priest places a cloth covering when transporting the holy gifts {{to and from the}} altar. Also found on the altar table is the antimins. The antimins is a silk cloth, signed by the appropriate diocesan bishop, upon which the sanctification of the holy gifts takes place during each Divine Liturgy. The antimins contain the relics of a saint. When a church is consecrated by a bishop, there is a formal service or prayers and sanctification {{in the name of the}} Saint that the church is named after. The bishop will also often present a small relic of a saint to place in or on the altar as part of the consecration of a new church.|$|E

Ostensibly Cassandra destroyed or censored her sister's letters to prevent their falling into the hands of relatives and ensuring that [...] "younger nieces did not read any of Jane Austen's sometimes acid or forthright comments on neighbors or family members". Cassandra believed that in the interest of tact and Jane's penchant for forthrightness, these details should be destroyed.

500|$|Ono was {{a pioneer}} of {{conceptual}} art and performance art. A seminal performance work is Cut Piece, first performed in 1964 at the Sogetsu Art Center in Tokyo. The piece consisted of Ono, dressed in her best suit, kneeling on a stage {{with a pair of}} scissors in front of her. She invited and then instructed audience members to join her on stage and <b>cut</b> <b>pieces</b> of her clothing off. Confronting issues of gender, class and cultural identity, Ono sat silently until the piece concluded at her discretion. The piece was subsequently performed at New York's Carnegie Hall in 1965 and London's Africa Center in 1966. Of the piece, John Hendricks in the catalogue to Ono's Japan Society retrospective wrote: [...] " [...] unveils the interpersonal alienation that characterizes social relationships between subjects, dismantling the disinterested Kantian aesthetic model..... It demonstrates the reciprocity between artists, objects, and viewers and the responsibility beholders have to the reception and preservation of art." ...|$|E
2500|$|The entire {{discussion}} in England was over by 1696, {{and yet it}} seems to have fired Swift's imagination. Swift saw in the opposing camps of Ancients and Moderns a shorthand of two general ways of looking at the world (see the historical background, below, for some of the senses in which [...] "new men" [...] and [...] "ancients" [...] might be understood). The Tale of a Tub attacks all who praise modernity over classical learning. Temple had done as much, but Swift, unlike Temple, has no praise for the classical world, either. There is no normative value in Rome, no lost English glen, no hearth ember to be invoked against the hubris of modern scientism. Some critics have seen in Swift's reluctance to praise mankind in any age proof of his misanthropy, and others have detected in it an overarching hatred of pride. [...] At the same time, the Tale revived the Quarrel of Ancients and Moderns at least enough to prompt Wotton to come out with a new edition of his pamphlet attacking Temple, and he appended to it an essay against the author of A Tale of a Tub. [...] Swift was able to <b>cut</b> <b>pieces</b> from Wotton's [...] "Answer" [...] to include in the fifth edition of the Tale as [...] "Notes" [...] {{at the bottom of the}} page. [...] Swift's satire also gave something of a framework for other satirists in the Scriblerian circle, and Modern vs. Ancient is picked up as one distinction between political and cultural forces.|$|E
