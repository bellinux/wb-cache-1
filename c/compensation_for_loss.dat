Seeking <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>loss</b> of income on their bridges, the corporations of Windsor and Maidenhead made claims to the Treasury. In 1708 Windsor was granted an ex-gratia payment of £55 (equivalent to £ today) plus £25 and £20 to two tenants (equivalent to £ and £ respectively). Maidenhead's complaint, not made until 1714, was noted but no compensation paid.|$|E

500|$|By {{the mid-1960s}} it was {{apparent}} that considerable subsidence was being caused by mining in the built-up area of Manchester around Bradford Colliery. Many buildings were affected, particularly in Bradford village and Miles Platting, where in 1962 eleven council houses were so severely damaged they had to be demolished. The government approved an order restricting mining operations and ordered an enquiry to determine whether mining should continue unhindered, and if not whether <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>loss</b> of production should be paid; for the first time, the NCB required planning permission to mine under the city of Manchester. The NCB gave evidence to the enquiry in 1966 stating that for each ton of coal extracted from the colliery 5s 2d had to be paid out in compensation for surface damage– the highest for any pit in the region– contrasted with a national average of 6d per ton. The NCB's plans for the colliery included extending the mines beneath Collyhurst, Cheetham, and Ancoats, but the risk of causing yet more subsidence proved to be unacceptable. Therefore, despite sitting on [...] "vast reserves of premium coal", Bradford Colliery was closed in 1968 as being uneconomic. In its final year of operation the 1500 workers employed produced 530,298 long tons (593,933 short tons) of coal. The [...] site, renamed Eastlands, was cleared and its two deep shafts capped with reinforced concrete in a scheme costing £8million before redevelopment. Part of the site is now occupied by the City of Manchester Stadium.|$|E
