40|$|The use of <b>chain</b> <b>indices</b> is {{recognized}} as representing a superior method for measuring the volume growth of National accounts aggregates, especially in periods of structural change and rapid movements of relative prices. So, if {{the objective is to}} measure the actual movements of prices and volumes from period to period (e. g. from t- 1 and t), indices should be compiled between consecutive time periods. Changes in prices and volumes between periods that are separated in time are then obtained by cumulating the short-term variations or, in other words, by linking the indices between consecutive periods, to form “chain indices”. In the context of the revision of the GDP estimates, carried out for the 2000 National accounts benchmark, the <b>chain</b> <b>indices</b> have been adopted to deflate National accounts aggregates. Even though they do not meet the prerequisite of additivity, there is a wide agree-ment {{on the fact that the}} <b>chain</b> <b>indices,</b> whose weighting structures are yearly updated, provide a more accurate measure of the actual movement of volumes (or prices) from period to period.

40|$|The paper {{criticizes the}} {{translation}} of the so called GEKS (Gini - Eltetö - Köves - Szulc) method to make consistent (transitive, or "drift free") international comparisons of price indices (parities), into the intertemporal framework. It shows that transitivity appears to be "over-ambitious" and too restrictive in this context, where <b>chain</b> <b>indices</b> possibly may suffice. Formulas of GEKS indices are complicated geometric averages of many (2 m- 3) direct Fisher indices relating to m periods in time. They are therefore {{much more difficult to}} compile in praxis than both, chained and direct Fisher indices. They are only transitive for a given m, but as we are free to choose different m's there is no unique, "drift free" index to compare any two periods, s and t. Instead there are many indices Pst depending on m. Moreover with new periods, t+ 1, t+ 2, … the method requires an updating (as m increases) and a re-computing of all previously compiled indices Pst. With <b>chain</b> <b>indices</b> the update is much easier and {{there is no need for}} a re-computing. To avoid such problems a "rolling" variant (RGEKS), a kind of moving average methodology, has been proposed. With RGEKS (of which <b>chain</b> <b>indices</b> are the limiting case of m = 2), however, desirable properties of (standard) GEKS, such as transitivity and proportionality get lost, and with a cyclical movement in the prices we can well generate a trend in the indices which is absent in the underlying price data. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes an empirically {{feasible}} {{method for}} correcting the path-dependence bias of <b>chain</b> <b>indices</b> {{of the cost}} of living. <b>Chain</b> <b>indices</b> are discrete approximations to Divisia indices and {{it is well known that}} the latter are path-dependent: the level of a Divisia index is affected not just by the level of prices at the two endpoints but also by the path between the endpoints. It is also well-known that a Divisia index {{of the cost of}} living is path-independent if and only if all income elasticities are equal to one, a restriction that is decisively rejected by studies of consumer demand. In theory, the true cost of living index (or Konüs price index) could be derived by estimating the expenditure function. But this seems impractical due to data limitations: the number of independent parameters rises roughly in proportion to the square of the number of commodities and consumer price indices contain hundreds of items. This paper shows how this problem can in fact be overcome empirically using a flexible model of demand like the "Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System". The proposed method requires data only on prices, aggregate budget shares and aggregate expenditure. The method is applied to estimate Konüs price indices for 70 products covering nearly all the UK's Retail Prices Index over 1974 - 2004, with each year in turn as the base. The choice of base year for utility is found to have a significant effect on the index, even in the low inflation period since 1990.

Empirically, space-time inconsistency is extensive. Theoretically, space-time consistency prevails if the consumer’s utility function (or the revenue (GDP) function) is homothetic and if Divisia price indices are used to deflate nominal consumption (or GDP), both over time and across countries.
