50|$|Coded wire tags {{were first}} {{introduced}} in the 1960s {{as an alternative to}} fin clipping. The first CWTs used colored stripes and allowed about 5000 different color combinations to uniquely identify groups of tags. The next development was binary codes marked on tags by electrical discharge machining in 1971. Binary <b>codes</b> <b>allowed</b> 250,000 unique code combinations. The sequentially coded wire tag was introduced in 1985, which allowed tags with sequentially increasing numbers, or codes, to be cut from the same spool of wire, so that individual or small groups of fish could be uniquely identified.|$|E

50|$|Two {{versions}} of the software were available for either Apple Macintosh, or Microsoft Windows. The audio portion had music and announcements from Club Kidsoft. The software portion of the CD-ROM was devoted to kid contributed content such as paintings and written stories.Software could be purchased by calling the company and paying {{with a credit card}} number. The service representative would then provide a unique serial number which could be typed into the launcher program. Once verified this would allow the full version of the purchased game to be installed. This action is provided through a specially coded program generated by the installer, which behaved like a disc image mounting utility - correct unlock <b>codes</b> <b>allowed</b> the utility to decrypt and mount the contents from the disc images as part of the CD-ROM's internal structure.

5000|$|The {{investigation}} of the transmitted signals started immediately after the launch of Compass -M1 on 14 April 2007. Soon after in June 2007, engineers at CNES reported the spectrum {{and structure of the}} signals. [...] A month later, researchers from Stanford University reported the complete decoding of the “I” signals components. The knowledge of the <b>codes</b> <b>allowed</b> a group of engineers at Septentrio to build the COMPASS receiver [...] and report tracking and multipath characteristics of the “I” signals on E2 and E5B.Characteristics of the [...] "I" [...] signals on E2 and E5B are generally similar to the civilian codes of GPS (L1-CA and L2C), but Compass signals have somewhat greater power. The notation of Compass signals used in this page follows the naming of the frequency bands and agrees with the notation used in the American literature on the subject, but the notation used by the Chinese seems to be different and is quoted in the first row of the table.|$|E

30|$|It is {{difficult}} to hack and alter records stored in a blockchain, but not the programming codes and systems that implement its technology. MtGox, once the largest Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange, was hacked in March 2014, and bitcoins worth $ 700 million were stolen. Poorly-maintained and outdated <b>codes</b> <b>allowed</b> malefactors to double-spend (Bitcointalk 2014). A more recent incident afflicted a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) that holds large quantities of Ethereum, a cryptocurrency similar to bitcoins (Price 2016).

30|$|Ouaret et al. [45] {{compared}} R-S coded JPEG 2000 to the Slepian-Wolf/Wyner-Ziv distributed video coding (DVC) approach. Their {{results show}} that JPEG 2000 results in better quality at high error rates, even if only an EEP scheme was used, whereas DVC performs better at lower packet loss rates. In [46], JPEG 2000 and H. 264 streams are protected with UEP and transmitted over lossy packet networks. A performance comparison with multiple description coding shows that UEP achieves better quality. Chen et al. [47], by using progressive digital fountain <b>codes,</b> <b>allowed</b> different users to receive broadcast video at different qualities, depending on the reliability of their UDP-based WiFi link. In [48], the authors describe the emerging MPEG multimedia transport standard for delivering high bit rate video over packet-lossy networks, using a low-density generator-matrix FEC. They show {{the effectiveness of their}} method on the streaming of JPEG 2000 digital cinema.|$|E
40|$|Project {{utilizing}} QR {{codes to}} better connect paralegal students to legal information was piloted in the Fall 2011 semester. Approximately 30 students {{enroll in the}} Legal Research methods course each fall semester. The course requires paralegal students to utilize print resources to answer legal homework questions. As the law librarian, I wanted to better integrate information about the print resources on the bookshelves with the course textbook and the extensive course LibGuide. This also provides point-of-need assistance when the law librarian is not available. QR <b>codes</b> <b>allowed</b> students to scan a bar code, on the bookshelf near the title or {{at the end of}} the book ranges, to find relevant information about the source in their textbook.

30|$|This {{simplified}} setting naturally {{comes with}} limitations. First and concretely, {{the number of}} possible PIN codes for a typical smart card would of course be {{much larger than the}} 6 ones we investigate (e.g., 10, 000 for a 4 -digit PIN). In this respect, we first insist that the primary goal of the following experiments is to investigate the information leakages in EEG signals thoroughly, and this limited number of PIN <b>codes</b> <b>allowed</b> us to draw conclusions with good statistical confidence. Yet, we also note that this setting could be extended to a reasonable threat model. For example, one could target ≈ 1000 different users by repeatedly showing them ≈ 10 PIN codes among the 10, 000 possible ones and recover one PIN with good confidence. Second, and since the attacks we carry out essentially test familiar versus unfamiliar information, there is also a risk of false positives (e.g., an all zero code or a close to correct code). In this respect, our mitigation plan is to exploit statistical tools minimizing the number of false negatives, therefore potentially allowing enumeration among the most likely candidates [18].|$|E
40|$|This project {{involved}} {{performing the}} nuclear design and safety analyses needed {{to modify the}} license issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to allow operation of the Texas A& M University Nuclear Science Center Reactor (NSCR) with a core containing low enrichment uranium (LEU) fuel. The specific type of LEU fuel to be considered was the TRIGA 20 - 20 fuel produced by General Atomic. Computer codes for the neutronic analyses were provided by Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and the assistance of William Woodruff of ANL in helping the NSCR staff to learn {{the proper use of}} the codes is gratefully acknowledged. The codes applied in the LEU analyses were WIMSd 4 /m, DIF 3 D, NCTRIGA and PARET. These <b>codes</b> <b>allowed</b> full three dimensional, temperature and burnup dependent calculations modelling the NSCR core to be performed for the first time. In addition, temperature coefficients of reactivity and pulsing calculations were carried out in-house, whereas in the past this modelling had been performed at General Atomic. In order to benchmark the newly acquired codes, modelling of the current NSCR core with highly enriched uranium fuel was also carried out. Calculated results were compared to both earlier licensing calculations and experimental data and the new methods were found to achieve excellent agreement with both. Therefore, even if an LEU core is never loaded at the NSCR, this project has resulted in a significant improvement in the nuclear safety analysis capabilities established and maintained at the NSCR...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, I {{examine the}} Beatlesâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 five feature films {{in order to}} argue how {{undermining}} generic convention and manipulating performance <b>codes</b> <b>allowed</b> the band to control their relationship with their audience and to gain autonomy over their output. Drawing from P. David Marshallâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s work on defining performance codes from the music, film, and television industries, I examine film form and style to illustrate how the Beatlesâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 filmmakers used these codes in different combinations from previous pop and classical musicals in order to illicit certain responses from the audience. In doing so, {{the role of the}} audience from passive viewer to active participant changed the way musicians used film to communicate with their fans. I also consider how the Beatlesâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 image changed throughout their career as reflected in their films as a way of charting the bandâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s journey from pop stars to musicians, while also considering the social and cultural factors represented in the bandâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s image. Such elements in the Beatlesâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 carefully constructed image reflected youth culture and countercultural thoughts and beliefs. Finally, through a close analysis of the Beatlesâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 musical sequences I have shown how experimentation with artistic synergy enabled the band to produce new and innovative films and lyrics while allowing each member to develop as individual musicians. This experimentation and willingness to undermine traditional film and pop music practices helped to change artistsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 approaches in the entertainment industries...|$|E
