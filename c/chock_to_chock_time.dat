A moving ramp, consisting of wooden slats with <b>chocks</b> <b>to</b> prevent rowing boats from rolling over, was constructed to bypass the lock. The ramp was similar to an escalator, and small boats simply rowed towards it, and were carried up to the higher level while the occupants remained seated in their boat. The boat lift opened in 1909, and was powered by an electric motor. The date of its demise is uncertain, but its location on Ray Mill island can still be visited.|$|R
50|$|The mining {{industry}} uses wheel <b>chocks</b> <b>to</b> protect lubrication trucks and heavy maintenance vehicles from slipping on off-road terrain when placed in Park. The huge haul trucks, which can weigh up to 450 tonnes, require {{a much larger}} wheel chock that itself will weigh almost 40 kilograms. These circumstances will benefit from urethane wheel chocks that are lightweight enough to be maneuvered, yet can withstand the responsibility of holding a truck if a brake should fail. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) has established standards that wheel chocks are used when a vehicle is parked on a grade, and OSHA has guidelines that require wheel chocks during loading or unloading of a heavy truck.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Todays {{guidelines}} for advanced CPR emphasize chest compressions with good quality and early defibrillation. Prehospital CPR performed by ambulance crew, an {{automated external defibrillator}} (AED) is used. The AED analyzes the heart rhythm and the performer is following the advice <b>to</b> <b>chock</b> the heart or not, given by the AED. During on-going CPR there are sequences when no chest compression is performed known as hands-off time. Hands-off time includes {{the time for the}} AED to analyze the heart rhythm and the time when advice is given to the crew. Studies show that prolonged hands-off time has a negative impact on survival after a sudden cardiac arrest.  Purpose The purpose with this study was to look into if the hands-off time could decrease with use of manual mode on the defibrillator by the ambulance crew. The crew had to analyze, make a decision <b>to</b> <b>chock</b> or not, charge the defibrillator and give the chock if appropriate. Furthermore, the crews’ knowledge in analyzing heart rhythms that can be defibrillate was investigated.   Method A quasi-experimental method was used. 38 participants, all ambulance crew, were included in the study. The participants were randomized into two groups. One group performed CPR with an AED, the second group used the manual mode on the defibrillator. The study data were processed in SPSS.  Results The time preceding the first defibrillation was significant shorter in the group using manual mode. There was no difference in total hands-off time between the two groups.  All heart rhythms were interpreted right and all defibrillation were done correctly.  Conclusions Time from establish cardiac arrest to first defibrillation was significant shorter in manual mode. Furthermore, all heart rhythms were interpreted right and all defibrillation were done correctly.  Time from first defibrillation to start of chest compressions was equal in the two groups.  There {{were no significant differences in}} hands-off time between the two groups.    Keyword: ambulance, cardiac arrest, automatic external defibrillator, manual defibrillator, manual rhythm analyze, hands-off time...|$|R
40|$|Rice {{production}} in Africa {{has tended to}} be low-yielding, geographically dispersed, and uncompetitive against low-cost Asian imports, even when protected by high freight costs and substantial trade barriers. Skyrocketing prices in world markets in 2007 - 08 were a <b>chock</b> <b>to</b> African consumers, producers, and governments alike. When international rice prices were relatively low, rice imports did not pose economic or political problems for West African governments. Extremely expensive imports reversed that equation. This paper addresses the response to that reversal first by presenting a historical review of trends in the West African rice sector and, second, by assessing the effect of world rice prices on domestic prices, primarily at the consumer level.

Parent´s need the right support from the {{healthcare}} staff for their own wellbeing, but also {{to be able to}} give good support for their child. Par-ent´s experiences are of importance for the nurse in the healthcare of the child and their families. The aim of this study was to describe parent´s experiences of living with a child with a deliberate self-harm behavior. In this literature study ten qualitative articles were analyzed using the method of Friberg (2012). Eight articles were found by a systematic search and two articles were found in an unsystematic search. This study showed four main themes and ten subthemes. Main themes were parent´s experience of support, parent´s experience of different feelings, parent´s experience of fam-ily relations and parent´s experience of parenting. Subthemes were to experience lack of support from healthcare staff, to need support from the environment, to feel guilt and shame, to feel concern and fear, <b>to</b> experience <b>chock,</b> <b>to</b> communicate with their child, to experience a different relation-ship in the family, to maintain trust in the relationship between parent and child, wanting to protect their child, to feel unsecure in their parenting.

40|$|In {{the present}} work a {{numerical}} {{analysis of the}} flow field in rough microchannels is carried out using two approaches: Navier-Stokes equations provided with first order slip boundary condition and kinetic S-model equation with Maxwell diffuse reflecting boundary condition. An implicit scheme {{is used for the}} solution of S-model equation and an algorithm allowing massive parallelization in both physical and velocity spaces has been developed. The roughness geometry is modelled as a series of triangular obstructions with relative roughness ε equals to 1. 25 %, 2. 5 % and 5 %. A wide range of Mach numbers is considered, from nearly incompressible <b>to</b> <b>chocked</b> flow conditions and a Reynolds number up to 170. To estimate rarefaction effect the flow at Knudsen number ranging from 0. 01 to 0. 08 and fixed pressure ratio has been considered. Accuracy and discrepancies between full Navier - Stokes and Smodel solutions are discussed, assessing the range of applicability of first order slip condition in rough geometries. The effect of the roughness is discussed via Poiseuille number as a function of local Knudsen and Mach numbers...|$|R

He {{had heard of}} the attempt to land an aircraft on Helvellyn earlier that month, but the flyers John F. Leeming and Bert Hinkler had been delayed by weather and mechanic problems. The earlier attempts would have been recorded by Mr. Sandham, the manager of Thirlmere reservoir, who made a previous reconnaissance visit with Leeming to clear a landing strip. He decided on another attempt, but unfortunately by this time Sandham had retired from the mountain. After an eventful bumpy flight over the Lake District they spiralled down to the summit. No doubt looking for the cleared strip. Leeming also noticed someone sheltering at the summit cairn. A witness (E.R. Dodds). The landing was easy as strong headwind and steep slope stopped them at once. Once down Hinckler had to use full throttle on the slope, whilst Leeming found rocks <b>to</b> <b>chock</b> the wheels <b>to</b> stop them rolling backwards.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{analysis of the}} flow field in rough microchannel is carried out with a finite volume compressible solver, including generalized Maxwell slip flow boundary conditions suitable for arbitrary geometries. Roughness geometry is modeled {{as a series of}} triangular obstructions. The relative roughness from 0 % to 2. 65 % was considered. Because for truly compressible flow we have no fully developed flow condition, the simulation is performed over the whole length of the channel. A wide range of Mach numbers is considered, from nearly incompressible <b>to</b> <b>chocked</b> flow conditions. Flow conditions with a Reynolds number up to around 200 were computed. The outlet Knudsen number corresponding to the chosen range of Mach and Reynolds number ranges from a very low value to 0. 0249. Performance charts are presented in terms of both average and local Poiseuille number as a function of local Knudsen, Mach, and Reynolds numbers. In particular, it appears that roughness strongly decreases the reduction in pressure loss due to rarefaction. Thus, the roughness effect is stronger at a high Knudsen. Furthermore, the compressibility effect has a major effect on pressure drop when the local Mach number exceeds 0. 3...|$|R

40|$|High {{pressure}} drop and high length to hydraulic diameter ratios yield significant compressibility effects in microchannel flows, which compete with rarefaction phenomena at the smaller scale. In such regimes, flow field and temperature field {{are no longer}} decoupled. In presence of significant heat transfer, and combined with the effect of viscous dissipation, this yields to a quite complex thermo-fluid dynamic problem. A finite volume compressible solver, including generalized Maxwell slip flow and temperature jump boundary conditions suitable for arbitrary geometries, is adopted. Roughness geometry is modeled {{as a series of}} triangular shaped obstructions, and relative roughness from 0 % to 2. 65 % were considered. The chosen geometry allows for direct comparison with {{pressure drop}} computations carried out, in a previous paper, under adiabatic conditions. A wide range of Mach number is considered, from nearly incompressible <b>to</b> <b>chocked</b> flow conditions. Flow conditions with Reynolds number up to around 300 were computed. The outlet Knudsen number corresponding to the chosen range of Mach and Reynolds number ranges from very low value to around 0. 05, and the competing effects of rarefaction, compressibility and roughness are investigated in detail. Compressibility is found to be the most dominant effect at high Mach number, yielding even inversion of heat flux, while roughness has a strong effect in the case of rarefied flow. Furthermore, the mutual interaction between heat transfer and pressure drop is highlighted, comparing Poiseuille number values for both cooled and heated flows with previous adiabatic computation...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{examined}} whether {{individuals can}} fake {{their responses to}} a personality inventory if instructed to do so. Between-subjects and within-subject designs were meta-analyzed separately. Across 51 studies, fakability did not vary by personality dimension; all the Big Five factors were equally fakable. Faking produced the largest distortions in social desirability scales. Instructions to fake good produced lower effect sizes compared with instructions to fake bad. Comparing meta-analytic results from within-subjects and between-subjects designs, we conclude, based on statistical and methodological consid-erations, that within-subjects designs produce more accurate estimates. Between-subjects designs may distort estimates due to Subject · Treatment interactions and low statistical power. Recent years have seen a resurgence of interest in personality variables in industrial-organizational psychology (cf. Barrick & Mount, 1991).

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{describe}} {{and evaluate the}} management of patients with motor neurone disease {{from the perspective of}} a hospice. DESIGN [...] Retrospective analysis of hospice medical and nursing notes. SETTING [...] Established 62 bed teaching and research hospice. SUBJECTS [...] 124 patients with motor neurone disease cared for by the hospice between January 1980 and November 1990. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Patient profile; functional status; symptom control and use of opioids; insight; mode and management of death. RESULTS [...] 124 patients (67 women, 57 men) had a mean age 63. 9 years. The median length of admission was 61. 5 days (range 1 to 2147). 84 patients (68 %) were aware of their diagnosis and its implications when first seen by a hospice doctor. Functionally, the patients were very dependent. Symptoms such as pain, dyspnoea, and insomnia were major problems that responded well to opioids. Many patients were noted to deteriorate "suddenly," and in 58 % of cases death occurred within 24 hours of this deterioration. When dying, 106 patients (94 %) were peaceful and settled. 101 patients (89 %) received opioids during this dying period. No patient <b>chocked</b> <b>to</b> death. CONCLUSIONS [...] Although motor neurone disease is an uncommon disorder, many of its symptoms occur commonly in medical practice and must be actively treated. Opioids are both safe and effective for such treatment. The term chocking is both inaccurate and inappropriate in describing the cause of death in motor neurone disease and its use should be abandoned...|$|R
50|$|The Burt strut was {{introduced}} to replace previous timing mechanisms, whereby a chock with a sensor was placed behind the rear wheel of a car at the start. Due <b>to</b> the <b>chock</b> being related <b>to</b> {{the rear of the}} car at the start, and readings being taken {{from the front of the}} car at the finish, the degree of precision within which cars could be timed was limited. As most British hillclimb courses are somewhat less than 1500 yards (1372 m) long, it is not uncommon for competitors' times to be separated by only a few hundredths of a second. The introduction of theoretically more accurate light beam timing required that all cars provide a consistent surface with which to break the beam at both start and finish of the timed section. However, owing to the variable shape of vehicles and inconsistencies in the placing of the beam sensors, this was not a simple condition to meet before the introduction of the Burt strut.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project work is to computationally analyze shock waves in the Convergent Divergent (CD) Nozzle. The commercial CFD code Fluent is employed to analyze the compressible flow through the nozzle. The analysis is about NPR (Nozzle Pressure Ratio) i. e., the ratio between exit pressure of the nozzle to ambient pressure. The various models of CD Nozzle are designed {{and the results are}} compared. The flow characteristic of shockwave for various design of CD Nozzle is also discussed. The purpose of this project is to investigate supersonic C-D nozzle flow for increasing NPR (Nozzle pressure ratio) through CFD. The imperfect matching between the pressures and ambient pressure and exit pressure leads to the formation of a complicated shock wave structure. Supersonic nozzle flow separation occurs in CD nozzles at NPR values far above their design value that results in shock formation inside the nozzle. The one-dimensional analysis approximations are not accurate, in reality the flow detaches from the wall and forms a separation region, subsequently the flow downstream becomes non-uniform and unstable. Shock wave affects flow performance of nozzle from NPR value 1. 63 for existing geometrical conditions of nozzle. Problem of using this nozzle above 1. 63 NPR is shock wave at downstream of throat. After shock wave, static pressure increases further downstream of flow. It leads to flow separation and back pressure effects. Back pressure makes nozzle <b>chocked.</b> <b>To</b> investigate this problem, geometry of divergent portion is introduced and analysed through CFD. This is expected in resulting of reduction of flow separation and back pressure effect as well as increase in nozzle working NPR...|$|R
