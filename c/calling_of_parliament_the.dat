50|$|Amasone v. Attorney General was a {{judgment}} of Ward CJ delivered on 6 August 2003. The {{leader of the}} opposition requested an order regarding the <b>calling</b> <b>of</b> <b>parliament.</b> <b>The</b> Chief Justice delivered directions as to how the governor-general should proceed to take any action he considers to be appropriate under Section 116(1) of the Constitution, acting in his own deliberate judgment, rather than as advised by the cabinet. That is, the governor-general could consider whether it was appropriate to exercise his reserve powers in calling parliament.|$|E

50|$|Over the centuries, <b>the</b> English <b>Parliament</b> {{progressively}} limited <b>the</b> {{power of}} the English monarchy which arguably culminated in the English Civil War and the trial and execution of Charles I in 1649.

60|$|The Barons {{advanced}} to London, and, quartering their followers in Holborn and Clerkenwell, spent a fortnight in deliberation. It {{appears that the}} token of adherence to their party was the wearing of a white favor, on which account the session <b>of</b> 1321 was <b>called</b> <b>the</b> <b>Parliament</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> White Bands. One day, when these white ensigns mustered strongly, the Barons brought forward an accusation on eleven counts against the two Despensers, and on their own authority, {{in the presence of}} the King, banished them from the realm, and pardoned themselves for their rising in arms. Edward had no power to resist, and, accordingly, the act was entered on the rolls, and the younger Hugh was driven from Dover, to join his father on the Continent.|$|R
40|$|The {{civil service}} {{system is the}} {{backbone}} of the administrative machinery of the Indian nation. India which is a union of states, has a democratic system. The political system of the country is pluralistic, having three tiers of administration, namely, central, provincial, and local. <b>The</b> federal <b>parliament</b> is bicameral. <b>The</b> lower house known as the Lok Sabha, constitutes elected members <b>of</b> <b>parliament.</b> <b>The</b> members <b>of</b> the upper house, known as the Rajya Sabha, are elected by the various provinces on the basis of an assigned strength. Together, the two houses constitute <b>parliament</b> and <b>the</b> members <b>of</b> these houses are <b>called</b> Members <b>of</b> <b>Parliament.</b> At <b>the</b> local level, the villages have Panchayats (council of villagers). Several villages constitute a block and the block-level councils are headed by Pradhans, known as chiefs of the blocks. These Pradhans constitute a district council which is headed by a district chief. The elections are governed by the principle of majority vote, which simply means that the elections are decided {{on the basis of the}} highest votes polled by a person. India is a multi-religious country. Its Constitution adopted in 1950 declared the country as a secular state. The Constitution recognised the special rights of minorities...|$|R
6000|$|Laud {{proposed}} that the council should recommend to the king <b>the</b> <b>calling</b> <b>of</b> a <b>Parliament.</b> At <b>the</b> same time, they passed a resolution that, in case <b>the</b> <b>Parliament</b> [...] "should prove peevish, and refuse to grant supplies, they would sustain the king in the resort to extraordinary measures." [...] This {{was regarded as a}} threat, and did not help to prepossess the members favorably in regard to the feeling with which the king was to meet them. The king ordered <b>the</b> <b>Parliament</b> to be elected in December, but did not call them together until April. In the mean time, he went on raising an army, so as to have his military preparations in readiness. He, however, appointed a new set of officers to the command of this army, neglecting those who were in command before, as he had found them so little disposed to act efficiently in his cause. He supplied the leader's place with Strafford. This change produced very extensive murmurs of dissatisfaction, which, added to all the other causes of complaint, made the times look very dark and stormy.|$|R
5000|$|In 1834, {{the primary}} Imperial yard {{standard}} was partially destroyed {{in a fire}} known as <b>the</b> Burning <b>of</b> <b>Parliament.</b> In 1838, a commission was formed to reconstruct the lost standards, including the troy pound, which had also been destroyed. In 1845, a new yard standard was constructed based on two previously existing standards known as A1 and A2, both {{of which had been}} made for the Ordnance Survey, and R.S. 46, the yard of the Royal Astronomical Society. All three had been compared to the Imperial standard before the fire. The new standard was made of Bailys metal No. 4 consisting of 16 parts copper, [...] parts tin, and 1 part zinc. It was 38 inches long and 1 inch square. The Weights and Measures Act of 1855 granted official recognition to the new standards. Between 1845 and 1855 forty yard standards were constructed, one of which was selected as the new Imperial standard. Four others, known as Parliamentary Copies, were distributed to The Royal Mint, The Royal Society of London, The Royal Observatory at Greenwich, and the New Palace at Westminster, commonly <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Houses <b>of</b> <b>Parliament.</b> <b>The</b> other 35 yard standards were distributed to the cities of London, Edinburgh, and Dublin, as well the United States and other countries (although only the first five had official status). The imperial standard received by the United States is known as [...] "Bronze Yard No. 11" ...|$|R
50|$|In 1355 Peter IV <b>called</b> a <b>parliament</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sard nobility {{in order}} to address the {{resistance}} to his rule of Judge Marianus IV of Arborea, but the greater nobles refused to attend. This was nevertheless <b>the</b> first Sardinian <b>parliament.</b> One <b>of</b> its acts was to exclude all those of non-noble birth from entering the nobility (heretats). Its role was formalised in the constitution promulgated by Alfonso V in 1421, after which it was convened (semi-)regularly every ten years. Many members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sardinian <b>parliament</b> visited <b>the</b> Corts <b>of</b> Catalonia and were familiar with its functioning. The Corts in turn seems to have regarded Sardinia as lying within its jurisdiction, for in 1366 it petition Peter IV to revoke the law of exclusion passed in 1355. The king refused {{on the grounds that it}} was not right for laws passed by <b>the</b> <b>parliament</b> <b>of</b> one kingdom to be revoked by <b>the</b> <b>parliament</b> <b>of</b> another. This was relevant to Peter's other dispute with the Catalans, who wished to be exempted from the Sardinian customs regime. So long as Catalans were residents of the island they were subject to its parliament's laws. In 1421, in imitation of the Corts, the Stamenti demanded the redress of grievances before voting on taxes. Establishing the priority of the former greatly augmented a <b>parliament's</b> power. When <b>the</b> taxes were approved, the Stamenti established a committee of three, one from each estate, to oversee their collection.|$|R
60|$|My Author is {{the happiest}} in one faculty, I ever knew. He is still {{advancing}} some new Position, which without proving, he slurs upon us for an Argument: though he knows, that Doctrines without proofs will edifie but little. That the Kings Prerogative is subservient, or {{in order to}} the ends of Government is granted him. But what strange kind of Argument is this, to prove that we are cheated of that Protection to which we are born. Our Kings have always been indued with <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> <b>calling</b> <b>Parliaments,</b> nominating <b>the</b> time, appointing of the Place, and Dissolving them when they thought it for the publick good: And the People have wisely consulted their own welfare in it. Suppose, for example, that there be a Jarring between the three Estates, which renders their sitting at that time Impracticable; since none of them can pretend to Judge the proceedings of the other two, the Judgment of the whole must either reside in a Superiour power, or the discord must terminate in the ruine of them all. For if one of the three incroach too far, there is so much lost in the Balance of the Estates, and so much more Arbitrary power in one; 'Tis as certain in Politiques, as in Nature; That where the Sea prevails the Land loses. If no such discord should arise, my Authors Argument is of no farther use: for where <b>the</b> Soveraign and <b>Parliament</b> agree, there can be no deluding of the People; So, that in short, his quarrel is to the constitution of the Government.|$|R
