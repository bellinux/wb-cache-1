40|$|This {{research}} {{attempts to}} create a recommended <b>digital</b> <b>marketing</b> strategy for Pan Macmillan, South Africa. As {{a result of the}} advance of technology and the increase of connectivity, <b>digital</b> <b>marketing</b> is becoming a highly important tool with regards to competitive advantage, differentiation and the overall marketing of a company and its product or service (Barwise and Farley, 2005, p. 68). <b>Digital</b> <b>marketing</b> is, in South Africa specifically, a relatively new concept (Sandmann, 2014, p. 1). If South African companies are able to efficiently utilise the gap in the market, they will ensure a significant competitive advantage (Sandmann, 2013, p. 1). In order to accomplish this successfully a <b>digital</b> <b>marketing</b> strategy must be created and adopted to ensure a full understanding of the requirements of effective <b>digital</b> <b>marketing.</b> This research focusses on understanding <b>digital</b> <b>marketing</b> requirements in relation to a South African book publisher and how those requirements can be met by the publisher through the development of a <b>digital</b> <b>marketing</b> strategy. The literature has been reviewed and previous research indicates that an established framework is needed to guide the development of a <b>digital</b> <b>marketing</b> strategy. The framework used in this research is the RACE framework (Chaffey and Bosomworth, 2013, p. 14) which is used in conjunction to the SOSTAC planning system (Chaffey and Bosomworth, 2014, p. 11) and the 7 steps to <b>digital</b> <b>marketing</b> strategy creation (Chaffey and Bosomworth, 2014, p. 2). The literature suggests that a combination of the established traditional marketing strategy of a company and current <b>digital</b> <b>marketing</b> practices and tools is the most practical with regards {{to the development of a}} successful <b>digital</b> <b>marketing</b> strategy, implementation and evaluation. In order to understand the current marketing strategy and practices of Pan Macmillan, interviews with the Marketing Manager of the company were conducted as well as an analysis of marketing documents relating to Pan Macmillan’s current marketing actions. Results of the interviews and documentation analysis showed that Pan Macmillan had many elements <b>digital</b> <b>marketing</b> but no decisive <b>digital</b> <b>marketing</b> strategy. Using the selected frameworks and information gathered on the company’s <b>marketing</b> practices, <b>digital</b> <b>marketing</b> goals were established and a <b>digital</b> <b>marketing</b> strategy was created. The goals of the research were reached as a recommended <b>digital</b> <b>marketing</b> strategy was developed for Pan Macmillan based on the assessment made, using RACE, SOSTAC and the 7 steps to <b>digital</b> <b>marketing</b> creation, of the company’s current practices, challenges and opportunities with regards to <b>digital</b> <b>marketing...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract The <b>digital</b> <b>marketing</b> {{environment}} is changing rapidly, and, for micro-enterprises, <b>digital</b> <b>marketing</b> {{is currently a}} vitally important opportunity. Attracting customers, engaging customers’ interest and participation, retaining customers, learning customers’ preferences and relating to customers are key strategies in building strong customer relationships. However, many enterprises ignore longer-term aspects of managing customer relationships. The study sought {{to contribute to a}} more in-depth understanding of micro-enterprises’ current strategies in terms of new <b>digital</b> <b>marketing</b> tools that foster stronger customer relationships. Based on interviews of two <b>digital</b> <b>marketing</b> service providers, this paper describes how their micro-enterprise clients use <b>digital</b> <b>marketing</b> tools through the five elements of building customer relationships. The findings highlight the importance of a practical understanding of <b>digital</b> <b>marketing</b> tools, as the <b>digital</b> <b>marketing</b> environment changes rapidly. The human capital and digital tool knowledge of micro-enterprises’ owner-managers have a great impact on these firms’ <b>digital</b> <b>marketing</b> and, ultimately, their success...|$|R

O presente estudo visa analisar as estratégias de <b>{{marketing}}</b> <b>digital</b> dos clubes catarinenses da Série A do Campeonato Brasileiro 2015, por meio da identificação das estratégias de <b>marketing</b> <b>digital</b> elaboradas pelos gestores dos clubes estudados e pela comparação entre essas estratégias de <b>marketing</b> <b>digital.</b> Sendo assim, fez-se levantamento bibliográfico baseado nas duas principais vertentes do estudo: <b>marketing</b> <b>digital</b> e <b>marketing</b> esportivo, assim como a relação de tais conceitos por meio da inserção do <b>marketing</b> <b>digital</b> no esporte. Posteriormente ao levantamento, realizou-se entrevistas com os principais responsáveis pelo marketing dos clubes: Avaí, Chapecoense, Figueirense e Joinville, em que utilizou-se o roteiro de entrevista a fim de identificar e posteriormente analisar as estratégias e ações dos clubes nas perspectivas de perfil dos gestores de marketing, ações de marketing e estratégias de <b>marketing</b> <b>digital.</b> Diante disso, pode-se verificar que o marketing dos clubes analisados atua de forma semelhante e, mesmo não obtendo vastos recursos financeiros para grandes ações, estão em constante busca por ações e estratégias de marketing que visam valorizar e melhorar cada vez mais o relacionamento com seus associados, assim como atrair novos sócios-torcedores, que são alguns dos principais geradores de receita regular. Verificou-se que os clubes enxergam a importância de estarem presentes e atuantes no ambiente digital, e que o Facebook tornou-se uma das principais ferramentas de interação e relacionamento com seus torcedores, fazendo do site oficial do clube um instrumento mais institucional e informativo. Ainda assim, os clubes também estão presentes e ativos nas outras principais redes sociais, como marketing direto no Twitter, vídeo marketing no YouTube, e conteúdo visual no Instagram. Além disso, pode-se verificar que também estão iniciando a expansão para redes sociais menos populares, mas com grande potencial de crescimento e possibilidades de atuação, como Whatsapp e Snapchat, assim como investindo em aplicativos. Por fim, percebe-se que os clubes analisados ainda tem muito a ser desenvolvido no <b>marketing</b> <b>digital,</b> embora venham atuando de maneira consistente e de acordo com as finalidades das ferramentas com o grande objetivo de satisfazer as necessidades e desejos de seus principais clientes, os torcedores. This monography aims {{to analyze}} the <b>digital</b> <b>marketing</b> strategy of Santa Catarina’s soccer clubs First Division in the Brazilian Championship 2015 through the identification of <b>digital</b> <b>marketing</b> strategies created by the marketing managers of the studied soccer clubs and also through the comparison between these <b>digital</b> <b>marketing</b> strategies. Therefore, the literature is based on two main fields of study: <b>digital</b> <b>marketing</b> and sports marketing, {{as well as the}} relationship of these concepts through the application of <b>digital</b> <b>marketing</b> in sports. Posteriorly, some interviews were held with the main responsible person of the marketing department at the following soccer clubs: Avaí, Chapecoense, Figueirense and Joinville. They were used as a guide in order to identify and analyze the clubs’ strategies and marketing actions profile through the marketing managers’ perspectives, <b>marketing</b> campaigns and <b>digital</b> <b>marketing</b> strategies. Therefore, can be perceived that the marketing of the analyzed soccer clubs operates similarly and even though they don’t get significant financial resources for investing on big marketing actions, they are constantly using marketing actions and strategies aiming to enhance and continuously improve the relationship between the soccer clubs and its associates, as well as attracting new members-supporters, who are among the main regular income generators. It was found that the soccer clubs perceive the importance of being present and active in the digital environment and that Facebook {{has become one of the}} main tools of interaction and relationship between the soccer clubs and its fans,making the soccer clubs’ official websites an institutional and informative resource. Besides that, the soccer clubs are also present and active in other major social networks such as Twitter’s direct marketing, video marketing on YouTube, and visual content on Instagram. Moreover, it is realized that the soccer clubs are starting to expand into less popular social networks, but with high growth potential and possibilities for marketing actions, such as Whatsapp and Snapchat, as well as investing in apps. Ultimately, although the analyzed soccer clubs still have a lot to develop in <b>digital</b> <b>marketing,</b> they have been consistently acting according to the purposes of the <b>digital</b> <b>marketing</b> tools with the ultimate goal of satisfying the wants and needs of its main customers, the fans...|$|R
