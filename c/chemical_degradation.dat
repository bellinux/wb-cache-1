25|$|<b>Chemical</b> <b>degradation</b> {{of objects}} occurs {{not in the}} {{physical}} structure of the object but rather in at the chemical or compound level. Compounds begin to breakdown into more simpler compounds and is often an undesired reaction. The degradation of the chemical component of an object will hinder or weaken {{the stability of the}} object when exposed to environmental factors such as water, air, pollution, heat, humidity, and the like.|$|E
25|$|Any storage or display {{situation}} {{must take}} into consideration the temperature at which collection permanence can be optimized, and systems should be in place that aim to meet that standard, ideally in conjunction with efficient use of energy and funds. Different materials react to temperature in different ways. For example, ceramics are vulnerable to direct heat on a mechanical level, but many organic materials are at greater risk of undergoing phase transition if the temperature becomes excessively cold. One rule of thumb applies across the board: the rate of chemical reactions is dependent upon temperature {{in such a way that}} higher temperatures reduce the activation energy and hasten <b>chemical</b> <b>degradation</b> processes.|$|E

25|$|Land transformation, {{the use of}} land {{to yield}} goods and services, is the most {{substantial}} way humans alter the Earth's ecosystems, and is considered the driving force {{in the loss of}} biodiversity. Estimates of the amount of land transformed by humans vary from 39 to 50%. Land degradation, the long-term decline in ecosystem function and productivity, is estimated to be occurring on 24% of land worldwide, with cropland overrepresented. The UN-FAO report cites land management as the driving factor behind degradation and reports that 1.5 billion people rely upon the degrading land. Degradation can be deforestation, desertification, soil erosion, mineral depletion, or <b>chemical</b> <b>degradation</b> (acidification and salinization).|$|E
25|$|The kinetic {{process of}} destabilisation can be rather long (up to several {{months or even}} years for some products) and it is often {{required}} for the formulator to use further accelerating methods in order to reach reasonable development time for new product design. Thermal methods are the most commonly used and consists in increasing temperature to accelerate destabilisation (below critical temperatures of phase inversion or <b>chemical</b> <b>degradation).</b> Temperature affects not only the viscosity, but also interfacial tension in the case of non-ionic surfactants or more generally interactions forces inside the system. Storing a dispersion at high temperatures enables to simulate real life conditions for a product (e.g. tube of sunscreen cream in a car in the summer), but also to accelerate destabilisation processes up to 200 times.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{structures}} of four new anthracyclines (rudolphomycin (1 1), collinemycin (12), mimimycin (13), alcindoromycin (14)) have been {{determined by a}} combination of <b>chemical</b> <b>degradations</b> and spectral interpretation. The use of 13 C NMR spec-troscopy has been extensive and assignments to the 13 C NMR spectra of these compounds have been made. The marked clinical effectiveness of the antitumor antibi-otics adriamycin and daunomycin (1 and 2) (Figure 1) has led to an intensive search for new members of this interesting class of compounds. * This search has resulted in the isolation and characterization of a number of new agents: carminomycin...|$|R

2500|$|The {{disposal}} of laboratory ethidium bromide remains a controversial subject. [...] Ethidium bromide can be degraded chemically, or collected and incinerated. [...] It {{is common for}} ethidium bromide waste below a mandated concentration to be disposed of normally (e.g., pouring it down a drain). [...] A common practice is to treat ethidium bromide with sodium hypochlorite (bleach) before disposal. [...] According to Lunn and Sansone, <b>chemical</b> <b>degradation</b> using bleach yields compounds which are mutagenic by the Ames test. [...] Data are lacking on the mutagenic effects of degradation products. [...] Lunn and Sansone describe more effective methods for degradation. Elsewhere, ethidium bromide removal from solutions with activated charcoal or amberlite ion exchange resin is recommended. [...] Various commercial products are available for this use.|$|E

40|$|The Dufour's gland {{secretion}} of C. scutellaris {{contains a}} series of C 23 long chain derivatives characterized {{by the presence of}} a cross-conjugated dienone linked to either a primary acetate, an aldehyde, or a carboxylic acid function. These compounds further differ from each other by the degree of unsaturation and (or) the position of an isolated double bond in the carbon atom chain. A combination of spectroscopic data and <b>chemical</b> <b>degradations</b> led to structures 1 a-c, 2 a-c, and 5 a-c for the major components of the secretion.

The protein concentration-dependency of the interaction and {{the effect on the}} {{interaction of}} various enzymic and <b>chemical</b> <b>degradations</b> of the polysaccharides were investigated by using a turbidimetric technique. The results indicate that, in addition to certain structural requirements, the molecular weight of the polysaccharides and the concentration of protein are important factors controlling the extent of interaction.

40|$|International audienceWe {{designed}} efficient precursors {{that combine}} complementary associative groups with exceptional binding affinities and thiocarbonylthio moieties enabling precise RAFT polymerization. Well defined PS and PMMA supramolecular polymers with molecular weights up to 30  kgmol(- 1) are synthesized and shown to form highly stable supramolecular diblock copolymers (BCPs) when mixed, in non-polar solvents {{or in the}} bulk. Hierarchical self-assembly of such supramolecular BCPs by thermal annealing affords morphologies with excellent lateral order, comparable to features expected from covalent diblock copolymer analogues. Simple washing of the resulting materials with protic solvents disrupts the supramolecular association and selectively dissolves one polymer, affording a straightforward process for preparing well-ordered nanoporous materials without resorting to crosslinking or invasive <b>chemical</b> <b>degradations...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceIt {{has been}} {{previously}} reported that α-lactose could be totally amorphized by ball milling. In this paper we report a detailed investigation of the structural and microstructural changes by which this solid state amorphization takes place. The investigations have been performed by Powder X-ray Diffraction, Solid State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ((13) C CP-MAS) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry. The results reveal the structural complexity of the material {{in the course of}} its amorphization so that it cannot be considered as a simple mixture made of a decreasing crystalline fraction and an increasing amorphous fraction. Heating this complexity can give rise to a fully nano-crystalline material. The results also show that <b>chemical</b> <b>degradations</b> upon heating are strongly connected to the melting process...|$|R

Wang (2000) reported {{that the presence of}} additives in an enzyme preparation may have adverse effects, which could be due to the crystallization of the additives during storage; the destabilization can be also attributed to the failure of the dextran to interact effectively, by hydrogen bonding, with the protein molecules. The stabilization mechanism of the additives could be attributed mainly to their ability to inhibit the aggregation of the protein by physical or chemical interactions, the <b>chemical</b> <b>degradations,</b> the deamination, the oxidation of side chains or the hydrolysis of the lyophilized protein formulations.|$|R

The two types of angular protons, which cannot be distinguished in the spectrum of dibenzo [g,p] chrysene, give rise to two distinct signals in the spectrum of quinone VII (H‐α 3 − and H‐α 4 − singlets separated by 4 c/s). The N. M.
