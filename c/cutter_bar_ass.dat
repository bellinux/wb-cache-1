(some col.) This research investigated bearing failures in {{a spur gear}} <b>cutter</b> <b>bar</b> used in the agricultural equipment sector for cutting forage crops. The <b>cutter</b> <b>bar</b> is under consideration by Case-New Holland (CNH) for use in their equipment. The primary focus {{of this investigation was}} to develop and test a real time monitoring system to monitor the health of the bearings during operation and alert the operator of the location of a pending bearing failure. This system uses temperature as the monitoring parameter and does not estimate the remaining useful life after the initial failure mode has been detected. The temperature profile of interest is that just before catastrophic failure and based on that is used to alert the operator. Causes of bearing failure within the <b>cutter</b> <b>bar</b> are also investigated theoretically to determine the effect that they would have on bearing life. Both <b>cutter</b> <b>bar</b> bending and bearing misalignment were analyzed from a theoretical perspective. Bending of the <b>cutter</b> <b>bar</b> was determined to not have a detrimental effect on the contact stresses within the bearings and thus no shortening of bearing life. Bearing alignment is a critical factor in bearing condition as excessive misalignment creates high contact stresses reducing the useful life. The gear train and bearings are retained between two steel halves creating a case, and to prevent excessive misalignment the case halves cannot shift by more than 0. 47 ± 0. 04 mm relative to the vertical axis of each bearing mount. Additional testing determined that operating the <b>cutter</b> <b>bar</b> on a hill has no effect on bearing life and that oil temperature can be used to monitor the correct amount of oil in the <b>cutter</b> <b>bar...</b>|$|R

40|$|Research and {{development}} of a reliable dry land production system for common bean (Phaseolus vulgarisL.) based on low-cost direct seeding and direct harvest methods was initiated at the Crop Development Centre at the University of Saskatchewan in the late 1980 s. The target production area is a dry land spring wheat farming region in which lentil and pea production is well established. Effort is focussed on production of the pinto class. Three major potential improvements to the production system were identified: harvest equipment modification to improve direct harvest capability, development of early maturing germplasm with reliable expression of a crop canopy suitable for direct harvesting systems, and appropriate agronomy to improve the reliability of production. The research effort in harvest equipment modifications resulted in commercialization of a new design of lifter and reel assembly for combines equipped with floating <b>cutter</b> <b>bar</b> headers. Field scale evaluations showed that a 50 % reduction in <b>cutter</b> <b>bar</b> loss is possible with cultivars with Type III growth habit. Agronomy research for new production systems has been limited to development of improved rhizobial strains, but new areas of research will be explored as appropriate cultivars become available. Research {{in the area of}} germplasm development is specifically focussed on gains in early maturity and improvements in canopy structure, particularly for the pinto class. The ideal canopy structure for the production system is one in which all pods are situated above the combine <b>cutter</b> <b>bar</b> at the time of harvest. Specific improvements to the canopy structure include development of early maturing genotypes with elongated Type I growth habit, Type II growth habit or Type III growth habit without basal clustering of pods. In addition, an effort is underway to develop genotypes with shorter pods to maximize <b>cutter</b> <b>bar</b> clearance are under development and with pods with reduced lignin to minimize shattering and maximize <b>cutter</b> <b>bar</b> clearance. Reduction of lignin in pods may help reduce shattering at the time of harvest due to reduced dehiscence. Pods with reduced lignin tend to curve upward at the time of maturity, allowing better clearance of the <b>cutter</b> <b>bar.</b> Agronomic comparisons of F 2 -derived F 4 and F 5 lines showed that in some populations <b>cutter</b> <b>bar</b> losses can be reduced by up to 50 %...|$|R

40|$|Oilseed {{rape seed}} loss during harvest can cause {{subsequent}} unwanted gene flow and thus give raise to management difficulties {{in order to}} keep segmented different productions. Furthermore, seed loss reduces benefits of producers. This loss was evaluated in different conditions and trials carried out in three French regions from 2002 to 2004. Seed loss was divided into three categories : before harvest, under the <b>cutter</b> <b>bar</b> and behind the combine harvester. Total loss represented on average 8, 2 % of the harvest for grain water content under 12 %. But this figure does not take an important variability into account. Indeed, an advanced <b>cutter</b> <b>bar</b> could reduce loss by 80 % and grain humidity at harvest plays an important part in the total loss level and its distribution. Before harvest low grain water content could make seed loss more sensitive to climatic events. Under the <b>cutter</b> <b>bar,</b> seed loss is inversely proportional to grain water content. On the contrary, it increases with grain water content behind the combine, due to loss in green siliquae. These studies can help improving advice to producers and contribute to improve gene flow models...|$|R

Every year {{a significant portion}} of edible oil is imported to the country from other countries. Despite this deficit, a great amount of canola is being lost every year. Therefore, in compliance with technical points, adding a suitable platform to the exisiting machineries may reduce the losses. A field study was conducted in Moghan Agricultural Research Centre to study the technical and economical characteristics of harvesting machineries and evaluate Canola harvesting losses in different maturity stages, using three different combine harvester heads. The experiments were conducted in a completely randomized	split split plot design with four replications. The main plot included seed maturity stage at three levels: A) 60 %, B) 70 % and C) 80 %, and the subplot was the harvester’s ground speed at three levels: A) 1. 5, B) 2. 5 and C) 3. 5 km h- 1. The sub-subplot was combine head type with three forms: A) Mechanical, B) Hydraulically Joybar and C) Hydraulically Biso's Head. The results of ANOVA showed that maximum <b>cutter</b> <b>bar</b> losses occurred with Mechanical Head (5. 36 %) while the loss of Hydraulically Joybar's and Biso's head were 4. 28 and 4. 13 %, respectively.

40|$|In recent decades, canola {{has been}} {{considered}} {{as the most important}} oilseed. Harvesting is the most major problem of canola cultivation, since canola pods are very sensitive to shocks and vibrations. Large amount of produce will fall on the ground especially when the combine's head is not adjusted properly. When canola harvested with a combine, the losses may reach up to 50 %. The yields can be improved by decreasing seed losses during the harvesting operation. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the optimal harvesting conditions of combine platform to minimize grain losses. In order to achieve this, a laboratory test stand platform was designed and built in the Department of Mechanics of Agricultural Machinery in Shiraz University. Three factors which are more effective on the losses were assessed to determine the best adjustments. These factors were combine forward speed at three levels; 1. 5, 2 and 2. 5 km h- 1, <b>cutter</b> <b>bar</b> speed at three levels; 800, 1100 and 1400 cycles per minute and the relative linear speed of reel in respect of forward speed also at three levels; 1, 1. 3 and 1. 5.

Only once Cyrus McCormick was able to acquire the rights to Hussey's cutter-bar mechanism (around 1850) did a truly revolutionary machine emerge. Other factors in the gradual uptake of mechanized reaping included natural cultural conservatism among farmers (proven tradition versus new and unknown machinery); the poor state of many new farm fields, which were often littered with rocks, stumps, and areas of uneven soil, making the lifespan and operability of a reaping machine questionable; and some amount of fearful Luddism among farmers that the machine would take away jobs, most especially among hired manual labourers.|$|R

Preface In practical production process, machining of internal thread for large diameter can be realized by using lathe tool for internal thread, but this method is difficult to machine internal thread of parts with small diameter, which is usually done by first drilling of base hole of the thread after machining process, and then using tapper to obtain the internal thread manually or with machine. By this traditional method for internal thread processing, the processes are distracted that increases time for handling, loading and unloading. It also lead to low efficiency, low accuracy of the perpendicularity error of thread. What’s more, tapper are always likely to break during tapping process, especially for parts with small diameter, and the depth of the thread is hard to control.
