25|$|The {{simplest}} single-engine {{steering system}} in mechanical terms, and almost universally used on early tank designs, was {{the combination of}} a brake and a <b>clutch</b> connected to <b>steering</b> controls. The controls were normally a pair of vertical handles, one for each track. Pulling on a handle disengaged the clutch, releasing that track and causing it to slow down. Further motion of the handle increasingly applied the brake to that track, allowing the turning circle to be adjusted.|$|R
25|$|The Chevette's 1.3 litre {{engine and}} {{relatively}} small bodyshell allowed for good performance. The Chevette had a light <b>steering,</b> <b>clutch</b> and gearchange, {{as well as}} good visibility and was spacious inside. The Chevette's success was probably due to its versatility, which compared well with larger cars like the Ford Escort. It was available in three-door hatchback for the single driver, and saloon models which suited families, estate car for the service fleets and the 'Chevanne', van version for all other utility purposes.|$|R
5000|$|The working Indigo had a 6.0L V12 48 valve DOHC [...] at 6100 rpm engine {{which used}} the parts and {{specifications}} from Ford's Duratec V6 engine {{found in the}} Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable.

This engine would later go on to power many cars by Aston Martin. The engine was bolted directly to the chassis, and is a load-bearing member for some suspension components, as is found with most Indy cars. The transaxle is a 6 speed unit with a manual <b>clutch,</b> and <b>steering</b> wheel mounted push button gear shifting, developed by Reynard for its Indy cars.

50|$|Cross-drive {{transmissions}} {{were developed}} from the earlier controlled-differential steering gearboxes. Their innovation was to cross-couple the two sides, so that excess power from the slow side of the gearbox could be supplied to the faster side. This reduced the power to be dissipated by braking and it increased the power available to drive the fast track. Implementing this was difficult for most transmissions as it required a varying gear ratio between the sides. Most gearboxes simply offered a single ratio, through fixed gears and <b>clutches,</b> which restricted <b>steering</b> to a single radius.|$|R
60|$|There {{had been}} a time when he could exhort himself to such {{fundamental}} charge and go through phases of the severest discipline. Always at last to be taken by surprise from some unexpected quarter. At last he had ceased to hope for any triumph so radical. He had been content to believe that in recent years age and a gathering habit of wisdom had somewhat slowed his leaping purpose. That if he hadn't overcome he had at least to a certain extent minimised it. But this last folly was surely the worst. To charge through this patient world with--how much did the car weigh? A ton certainly and perhaps more--reckless of every risk. Not only to himself but others. At this thought, he <b>clutched</b> the <b>steering</b> wheel again. Once more he saw the bent back of the endangered cyclist, once more he felt rather than saw the seething approach of the motor bicycle, and then through a long instant he drove helplessly at the wall....|$|R
25|$|The triple {{differential}} is {{a modification}} to the double differential, replacing the <b>steering</b> <b>clutches</b> {{with a single}} braked differential similar to controlled differential. This third differential produces any desired output speed in the steering shaft, compared to the double differential where {{the speed of the}} shaft is fixed. This output drives the steering idlers of an otherwise unchanged double differential, producing continuously variable steering. It has all the advantages of the double differential, with the only disadvantage is that the brake on the third differential dissipates some energy while slipping, but this is dependent only on the amount of energy being used to steer the vehicle, not the total energy being delivered to the tracks.|$|R
5000|$|The unique long-handled [...] "Thai" [...] type two-wheel tractor was {{developed}} in the late 1950s by M.R. Debriddhi Devakul (M.R. stands for Mom Rajawong, meaning that his great-grandfather was the King of Thailand, and that he could be properly addressed as [...] "Prince"), head of the Engineering Division of the Thai Rice Department, of the Thai Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives. As the early 2WTs did not have <b>steering</b> <b>clutches,</b> longer handles were provided for turning and controlling the tractor more easily in fields. Initially the engines were taken from kerosene engine powered irrigation pumps, but as the popularity of the tractor became obvious (known as the [...] "Iron Buffalo"), three Japanese firms set up diesel engine factories in Thailand with agreements to progressively increase local content. Later, <b>steering</b> <b>clutches</b> were provided on many companies' models. The tractor gear box and chassis are made by many local industries (Samakkee Lohakij Ltd., Agri-Mechanics Co Ltd., Ayutthaya Tractor Factory, Cosmonoki Thai International Co. Ltd., C.R. Tractor Co Ltd, Inter Kankaset Co. Ltd, Jakpetch Tractor Co. Ltd., Jor Charoenchai Tractor, Kor Rungruang, Muileng Industry Ltd., Samakkee Lohakij Ltd., Siam Kubota Industry Co. Ltd., etc.). Initially, factories copied from one another, and competing for sales {{to the point that the}} tractor's chassis without engine has become very inexpensive, about one third to one half the cost of the engine. The [...] "Thai tractor" [...] eventually evolved into a more general standard [...] "NC" [...] type models with three gears forward, one reverse, and <b>steering</b> <b>clutches.</b> Attachments that are available are moldboard and disc plows, spiked tooth harrows, trailed-type (non-powered) rotary puddlers (lateral drums with protruding paddles), various types of levelers and simple trailers (usually without brakes or lights). Recently (2010), a new NC Plus model offered by Siam Kubota comes with a [...] (PTO) that can drive a rotary tiller and other attachments. Additionally many farmers use V-belts to connect the stationary tractor engine to power centrifugal pumps and axial flow pumps, rice threshers, maize shellers etc. Recently inexpensive Chinese-made NC models have come on the international market but attempts by Siam Kubota and others to keep them out of Thailand, Cambodia and elsewhere due to claims of copyright infringement. Through the 1980s and 1990s, more than 50,000 tractors were reportedly being produced and sold each year and by 2006 more than 70,000 were being produced and even more imported so that estimates of 2WT population is between 1.7 - 2.0 million 2WTs in Thailand.|$|R
50|$|The Valentine was of {{conventional}} layout, divided internally into three compartments; {{from front to}} back the driver's position, the fighting compartment with the turret and then the engine and transmission driving the tracks through rear sprockets. The driver's area contained only the driver and the driving controls. The driver sat on hull centre line, entering through either of two angled hatches over the seat, though there was an emergency exit hatch beneath his seat. The driver had a direct vision port—cut in what was one of the hull's cross members—in front of him and two periscopes in the roof over his head. Driving was by <b>clutch</b> and brake <b>steering</b> through levers, whose control rods ran the length of the hull to the transmission at the rear.|$|R

6000|$|The engine {{began to}} make a chinking sound, and the car lost pace. And then Mr. Britling saw a {{pleading}} little white board with the inscription [...] "Concealed Turning." [...] For the moment he thought a turning might be concealed anywhere. He threw out his clutch and clapped on his brake. Then he repented {{of what he had}} done. But the engine, after three Herculean throbs, ceased to work. Mr. Britling with a convulsive <b>clutch</b> at his <b>steering</b> wheel set the electric hooter snarling, while one foot released the clutch again and the other, on the accelerator, sought in vain for help. Mr. Direck felt they were going back, back, in spite of all this vocalisation. He clutched at the emergency brake. But he was too late to avoid misfortune. With a feeling like sitting gently in butter, the car sank down sideways and stopped with two wheels in the ditch.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the heart}} of the system, acting as {{pressure}} sink as well as suspension elements, are the so-called spheres, five or six in all; one per wheel and one main accumulator as well as a dedicated brake accumulator on some models. On later cars fitted with Hydractive or Activa suspension, there may be as many as ten spheres. Spheres consist of a hollow metal ball, open to the bottom, with a flexible desmopan rubber membrane, fixed at the 'equator' inside, separating top and bottom. The top is filled with nitrogen at high pressure, up to 75 bar, the bottom connects to the car's hydraulic fluid circuit. The high pressure pump, powered by the engine, pressurizes the hydraulic fluid (LHM) and an accumulator sphere maintains a reserve of hydraulic power. This part of the circuit is at between 150 and 180 bars. It powers the front brakes first, prioritised via a security valve, and depending on type of vehicle, can power the <b>steering,</b> <b>clutch,</b> gear selector, etc.|$|R
5000|$|Because driver's hatch {{was moved}} from the glacis plate and {{positioned}} so that he exited the vehicle perpendicularly instead of crawling out of the hatch, his seat received an elevating mechanism. While in a relatively safe area the driver could elevate his seat to look outside of the tank, providing greater visibility and easier access to the controls. While in combat the driver lowered his seat back into the tank and {{had to rely on}} the vision slot protected by [...] (three-layer glass). While in this position the pedals of the main clutch, the fuel supply, and incline brake were positioned much higher and the levers of the <b>steering</b> <b>clutch</b> and gear shifting became inconvenient to operate. Early examples had transmission problems. While the driver was switching gears, two gears could engage simultaneously, which caused a broken gear pinion. This and other gearbox related problems were solved in a 1961 T-44M modernization with the introduction of a gearbox from the T-54 main battle tank.|$|R
5000|$|However, it was {{discovered}} that the rear of the vehicle was overloaded and that the vehicle's manoeuvrability was far from satisfactory. To counter the first problem, the rear tension wheels were enlarged, equipped with leaf springs and lowered to the ground, thus converting them to driving wheels. The problem with steering the tractor under heavy load was eventually solved by adding two <b>steering</b> <b>clutches</b> to both sides of the suspension system. The latter modification in 1938 was included also {{in the development of the}} TKS tankette (in the TKS-B variant). However, by then the serial production of TKS was stopped and in the end the C2P's undercarriage remained distinctive. However, as both designs were being developed simultaneously at the same facility, both were supervised by Rudolf Gundlach and their designers sometimes referred to the C2P as [...] "ciągnik TKS" [...] (TKS tractor), some sources call C2P a development version of TKS, which is not entirely true.|$|R
40|$|Due to {{environmental}} concern related to CO_{ 2 } emissions, automobile manufacturers has been increasingly engaging in electrifying multiples on-board applications. Functions {{that are being}} electrified involve crucial and complex applications such as <b>clutches,</b> power <b>steering,</b> assisted brakes and others. Furthermore, these functions are often placed in a particularly challenging environment in terms of spaces, thermal, vibration and acoustic. As results, research on electrical motors {{to find the most}} suitable motor to a given applications has been intensified. In this environment, machines optimal design requires simultaneous consideration of numerous physical phenomena; both in terms of expected performance and constraints to be respected. The physics that can be affected includes the electromagnetic / electromechanical performance, thermal behavior and vibro-acoustic behavior. Among a large choice of machine, with the manufacturer cost and manufacturing concern taken into account, the synchronous reluctance machine with segmented rotor {{has been found to be}} particularly interesting for application with severe ambient temperature and encumbrance limitation. This study has therefore as objectives to evaluate the capacity of the synchronous reluctance machine in all physics mentioned and eventually shows the interaction between these physics, thus performance alteration of the machine operated in automobile equipment environment. Multi-physics model were developed and confronted to experimental validations using a prototype machine that was designed for an electrical clutch. Using the validated model, different performance figures of synchronous reluctance machines with different rotor topologies were compared. Resulting from the study, valid electromagnetic, electromechanical, thermal and vibro-acoustic models are now available to be used as tools in future machine design. The synchronous reluctance with segmented rotor prototype machine has been shown to be capable to be used in the electrical clutch application studied in particular. Following performance evaluations in different physics, suggestions of improvements have also been proposed...|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to criticisms, the lighter KV-1S was developed, with thinner armour and a smaller, lower turret {{in order to}} reclaim some speed. Importantly, the KV-1S had a commander's cupola with all-around vision blocks. It also had a sophisticated planetary transmission that significantly increased the reliability, and allowed use of more efficient regenerative geared steering, unlike the solely <b>clutch</b> and brake <b>steering</b> systems used by the Panzer III, IV and T-34. Its reduced weight allowed it to achieve {{a top speed of}} 43.3 km/h. Over 1,300 were built before production ended in August 1943. Although the KV-1S was the best of the KV tanks, overcoming its predecessors' problems, more modern tanks were already in sight. Up-arming the regular turret of the KV-1S with an 85 mm S-31 resulted in the KV-1S-85. This was rejected as it came with the unacceptable loss of a dedicated commander, reducing the turret crew to two. However, the thinning-out of the armour called into question why the tank was being produced at all, when the T-34 could seemingly do everything the KV could do and much more cheaply. The Soviet heavy tank program was close to cancellation in mid-1943.|$|R

50|$|Morozov's {{new medium}} tank design {{received}} a skeptical response. It {{was believed that}} putting a high-speed 12-cylinder engine with a working displacement of almost 40 liters perpendicular to the direction of travel would cause problems, including breaking the connecting rods. It was believed that decreasing the displacement of the engine compartment {{for the purpose of}} enlarging the fighting compartment was unnecessary and that moving the turret rearwards would limit the elevation angle of the main gun. However, it turned out that even though rotating the engine complicated the transmission by introducing an additional reduction gear - gear-train and fan drive, it also solved many problems. The cover of the engine and transmission compartment turned along with the radiator; this allowed easier access to the engine, transmission and batteries. The significant decrease in the length of the engine compartment allowed the turret to be moved rearwards, which in turn moved its rotation axis and the center of mass {{to the center of the}} hull, increased the accuracy of the main gun and decreased a chance that the turret could get stuck after getting hit in the turret ring with a projectile that ricocheted. The thickness of the frontal armor protection more than doubled without disturbing the center of mass or drastically increasing the weight of the tank. At the beginning of World War II the thickness of T-34 armor was considered enough. Improvements made to the T-34 during World War II included increasing the caliber of the gun (from 76.2 mm to 85 mm) and thickening the armor of the turret. No significant improvements were made to the hull. Increasing the size of the fighting compartment allowed the removal of floor ammunition stowage. The height of the tank was decreased by 300 mm, even though the turret remained almost the same. Removal of the conical pair in the transmission permitted fitting a more compact gear box and improved the control of the brakes and the <b>steering</b> <b>clutch.</b> Visibility from the driver's position was improved. The driver was protected from being splashed by water while the vehicle was fording. The new torsion bar suspension allowed easier crossing of rough ground.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the result}} of the field {{experiment}} of the microcomputerized driverless combine is described. There are two ways of applying automatic control techniques to agricultural machinery. One of them can be applyed to unit farm machinery such as tractor and combine. The other is for agricultural facilities such as a green house or grain dryer plant. This research is included in the former category, and concerns control of a moving vehicle. For this kind of work, some difficulty is sometimes met in sensing and controlling optimally the actuator, because of the rapid and frequent change of circumstances under which the machine is running. In our former work, one of the authors reported on the programmed and feedback control systems of head feed type combine. However those controlling methods could not cover the multiple operation completely. The application of microcomputer not only to indutrial machines but also to agricultural machinery can solve this problem. The following advantages can be listed for the use of micro-computer with agricultural machinery : (1) Multi-input signals can be processed and controlled. (2) Software can easily help {{to solve the problem of}} changing the control process or procedure of routine work which was programmed and stored prior to the operation. (3) Time, labor and energy in agricultural operation can be saved. (4) Safety can be ensured. (5) Machinery can be systematically controlled. Based upon the above merits of using micro-computer with agricultural machinery, a micro-computerized driverless combine was constructed and its controllability was evaluated according to actual harvesting operation in the paddy field. From the test results, the following points are revealed. (1) The machine worked well and control was done satisfactorily, but the <b>steering</b> <b>clutches</b> should be adjusted for suitable braking force depending on the circumstances of steering and turning at the end of row of rice plants. (2) The hydraulic circuit should be modified to obtain the simultaneous control of the lifting motion of cutter bar and travelling, including the steering and turning. (3) The mechanical sensing device for detecting the cutting height did not work so well, especially in the muddy, wet field. A different type of sensor (such as ultrasonic or optical) is recommended, in addition to the consideration of the position or location of the sensor to be mounted. (4) The learning function should be added to improve the ease of adjustability of control factor referring to the field condition, etc. It can be concluded from this work that the possibility of applying the micro-computer control system to the combine was notably high, and this technique will probably be widely distributed for practical use and future commercial machines...|$|R
