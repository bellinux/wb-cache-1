40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the metal-ceramic bond strength (MCBS) of 6 metal-ceramic pairs (2 Ni-Cr alloys and 1 Pd-Ag alloy with 2 dental ceramics) and correlate the MCBS values with the differences between the coefficients of linear thermal expansion (CTEs) of the metals and ceramics. Verabond (VB) Ni-Cr-Be alloy, Verabond II (VB 2), Ni-Cr alloy, Pors-on 4 (P), Pd-Ag alloy, and IPS (I) and Duceram (D) ceramics were used for the MCBS test and dilatometric test. Forty-eight ceramic rings were built around metallic rods (3. 0 mm in diameter and 70. 0 mm in length) made from the evaluated alloys. The rods were subsequently embedded in gypsum cast in order to perform a tensile load test, which enabled calculating the CMBS. Five specimens (2. 0 mm in diameter and 12. 0 mm in length) of each material were made for the dilatometric test.

40|$|Purpose. The {{article is}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the influence of structural parameters of low-carbon steel on arcing process. Methodology. The values of the micro- and substructure characteristics of the electrode wire metal were changed by varying the parameters of heat treatment and cold deformation by drawing. The degree of plastic deformation was obtained by drawing blanks from different initial diameter to final dimension of 1 mm. The thermal treatment {{was carried out in}} electric chamber furnace of the SNOL- 1, 6. 2, 5. 1 / 11 -IZ type. The temperature was measured by <b>chromel-alumel</b> <b>thermocouple</b> and the electromotive force was determined using the DC potentiometer. In order to obtain the substructure of different dispersion degree the steel (after quenching from temperatures and tempering at 650 °C for 1 hour) was subjected to cold drawing to reduction 17 – 80 %. To form structure with different ferrite grain size the steel after drawing was annealed at 680 °C for 1 hour. The microstructure was examined under a light and electron transmission microscope UEMV- 100 K at the accelerating voltage 100 kV. The grain and subgrain sizes were evaluated using the methodologies of quantitative metallography. A welding converter of the PSG- 500 type was used to study the arc welding process of direct and reverse polarities. Findings. The experimentally detected value of the welding current, which depends on the degree of deformation during wire drawing, under conditions of stable arc burning of direct polarity is about an order of magnitude lower than the calculated value. Similar difference was found for the arc of reverse polarity: the experimental value of the welding current is 5 [...] . 6 times less than the calculated value. Dependence analysis shows that, regardless of the polarity of the welding arc, a good enough agreement between the calculated and experimental values of the welding current is limited to deformations of 60 %. For deformation degrees of more than 60 %, the differences are explained by qualitative changes in the dislocation cell structure. Originality. In the conditions of stable arcing of different polarity for the electrode of low-carbon steel, an extreme dependence of welding current on the degree of cold plastic deformation was observed. Practical value. Influence of ferrite grain size of electrode wire on the value of welding current is much greater than that from substructure presence...|$|E

These two facilities (the Radiant Heat Facility (RHF) and the Lurance Canyon Burn Site (LCBS)) routinely gather data from normal and abnormal thermal environment experiments. They are managed by Fire Science & Technology Department 09132. Uncertainty analyses were performed for several thermocouple (TC) data acquisition systems (DASs) used at the RHF and LCBS. These analyses apply to Type K, <b>chromel-alumel</b> <b>thermocouples</b> of various types: fiberglass sheathed TC wire, mineral-insulated, metal-sheathed (MIMS) TC assemblies, and are easily extended to other TC materials (e. g., copper-constantan). Several DASs were analyzed: (1) A Hewlett-Packard (HP) 3852 A system, and (2) several National Instrument (NI) systems. The uncertainty analyses were performed on the entire system from the TC to the DAS output file. Uncertainty sources include TC mounting errors, ANSI standard calibration uncertainty for Type K TC wire, potential errors due to temperature gradients inside connectors, extension wire uncertainty, DAS hardware uncertainties including noise, common mode rejection ratio, digital voltmeter accuracy, mV to temperature conversion, analog to digital conversion, and other possible sources. Typical results for 'normal' environments (e. g., maximum of 300 - 400 K) showed the total uncertainty to be about {+-} 1 % of the reading in absolute temperature. In high temperature or high heat flux ('abnormal') thermal environments, total uncertainties range up to {+-} 2 - 3 % of the reading (maximum of 1300 K).

Materials and Methods: A split-tooth model was built with a lateral groove at 3. 5 -mm from working length (WL) in order to insert a <b>Chromel-Alumel</b> K-type <b>thermocouple</b> placed in contact with gutta-percha. The thermocouple was connected to a digital thermometer. Sixty obturations were made with medium gutta-percha points. For 20 specimens the System B was used with the Buchanan fine plugger and the temperature was set at 200 C; for other 20 specimens the Endo-Twinn with a fine plugger was used and for the last 20 specimens we used the E-Fill with a 40. 04 plugger. All pluggers were pushed to 3. 5 mm from WL so that the tips were in contact to the probe. Results: The analysis of 60 samples showed the highest temperature average using the System B after 10 seconds (86. 85 C), after 15 seconds (94. 9 C), after 20 seconds (100. 4 C) and after 25 seconds (104. 5 C). The Endo-Twinn average values are similar to System-B ones. The E-Fill average values are lower (69. 9 C) than the other two systems evaluated only after 10 seconds due to limited working time. The temperatures average obtained using different systems of warm vertical compaction are lower than what was declared by the producing companies. Conclusion: Time is one the most important parameters to consider using these systems. Temperatures reached from the System B and Endo-Twinn after 25 seconds; however, seem to be sufficient to ensure an optimal adaptation of the gutta-percha in the anatomical complexity of root canals.

Since gasification is a complex thermochemical conversion process, {{it is difficult to}} distinguish the physical conditions during the gasification stages. And, gasification with different materials can result in different product yields. The main purpose of this research was to develop a downdraft gasifier system with a fully-equipped instrumentation system and a well-functioned tar measurement system, to evaluate temperature, pressure drop, and gas flow rate, and to investigate gasification performance using different biomass feedstock. <b>Chromel-Alumel</b> type K <b>thermocouples</b> with a signal-conditioning device were chosen and installed to monitor the temperature profile inside the gasifier.

A National Instruments (NI) USB- 6008 data acquisition board was used as the data-collecting device. As for the pressure, a differential pressure transducer was applied to complete the measurement. An ISA 1932 flow nozzle was installed to measure the gas flow rate. Apart from the gaseous products yield in the gasification process, a certain amount of impurities are also produced, of which tar {{is one of the main}} components.
