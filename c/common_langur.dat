40|$|The {{lion-tailed macaque}} (Macaca silenus), an {{endangered}} primate species, was surveyed {{in the tropical}} rainforests of Sringeri {{in the state of}} Karnataka, south India. A total of 10 groups and a solitary adult male were found in approximately 90 square kilometers of rainforest. The other sympatric arboreal mammals found included <b>common</b> <b>langurs,</b> bonnet macaques and Malabar giant squirrels. The liontailed macaques are sympatric with other primates and giant squirrels in the undisturbed core areas. More towards the human habitations and disturbed areas, the lion-tailed macaques are absent and the forest is occupied by commensal species. The habitat features and the population structure indicate that this region is a potential area for maintaining a biologically viable population of lion-tailed macaques. However, a number of factors such as extraction of fuel wood, collection of minor forest produce, grazing by domestic livestock and plantation of commercial tree species are causing a serious threat to the habitat. The effect of habitat degradation on arboreal wildlife is discussed and the steps are suggested to minimize the effect of human disturbance on habitat...|$|R

The new SRV is phylogenetically related to but distinct from the three molecularly characterized serotypes, SRV 1 – 3, of the five known serotypes of SRVs, based on sequence analyses from the 3 ′orf and env regions of the viral genome. The novel SRV isolated from the Indian Hanuman langur is provisionally named SRV- 6...|$|R
50|$|Until {{the age of}} seventeen, Walter Heape, born to {{a wealthy}} family, was taught by a private tutor and then was a student for one year at Owens College. From 1873 to 1879 {{he worked for a}} rice and sugar milling firm, then a {{merchant}} firm, and finally a cotton spinning mill before his health deteriorated and he decided to pursue a scientific career. After briefly studying physiology at Gamgee's laboratory in Owens College and then botany at Lawson's laboratory in Oxford, Heape went to Cambridge to study physiology under Foster, botany under Vines, and animal morphology under Balfour. Heape received an honorary M.A. from Cambridge on 10 December 1885. From 1879 to 1882 Heape concentrated under Balfour on mammalian embryology until Balfour's death age 30 in a mountain climbing accident. In 1882 Heape became an instructor and demonstrator in animal morphology as an assistant to Sedgwick and remained in that post until 1885. In May 1885 he was appointed the Assistant Secretary for the Marine Biological Association. On 14 December 1885 the Association appointed him Resident Superintendent to oversee the construction of the marine laboratory at Plymouth and also to conduct surveys of the marine life near Plymouth. He carried out these duties until his resignation on 1 September 1887 due to disagreements with the Association's Secretary E. Ray Lankester. Heape left Plymouth in March 1888 and then visited Egypt, Ceylon, India, Burma, and the Straits Settlements before returning to England in 1889. He was awarded a Royal Society Grant-in-Aid and a Balfour Studentship and in December 1889 left for India to collect early embryos from <b>common</b> <b>langurs</b> and rhesus monkeys. After only four months in India, Heape, suffering from illness, returned to England, having failed to collect any early embryos but being successful in preserving many female genital tract specimens of the primates.|$|R
25|$|Social {{hierarchies}} {{exist for}} all group types. In all-male groups, dominance is attained through aggression and mating success. With sexually mature females, rank {{is based on}} physical condition and age. The younger the female, the higher the rank. Dominance rituals are most <b>common</b> among high-ranking <b>langurs.</b> Most changes in social rank in males take place during changes in group members. An adult male may remain in a one-male group for 45 months. The rate of male replacement can occur quickly or slowly depending on the group.|$|R

5000|$|The Javan lutung (Trachypithecus auratus), {{also known}} as the ebony lutung and Javan langur, is an Old World monkey from the Colobinae subfamily.

It is found on and endemic to the island of Java, as well as on several of the surrounding Indonesian islands. The Latin word auratus in its scientific name means [...] "golden", and refers to a less common color variant. Note that the <b>common</b> name golden <b>langur</b> is used for a different species.|$|R
25|$|Infanticide is <b>common</b> among gray <b>langurs.</b> Most infanticidal langurs are males {{that have}} {{recently}} immigrated {{to a group}} and driven out the prior male. These males only kill infants that are not their own. Infanticide is more commonly reported in one-male groups, perhaps because one male monopolizing matings drives the evolution of this trait. In multiple-male groups, the costs for infanticidal males {{are likely to be}} high as the other males may protect the infants and they can't ensure that they'll sire young with other males around. Nevertheless, infanticide does occur in these groups, and is suggested that such practices serve to return a female to estrous and gain the opportunity to mate.|$|R
