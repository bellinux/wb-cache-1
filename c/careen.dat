5|$|In August 1718, Bonnet {{anchored}} the Royal James on an estuary of the Cape Fear River to <b>careen</b> {{and repair}} the ship. In late August and September, Colonel William Rhett, with the authorization of South Carolina governor Robert Johnson, led a naval expedition against pirates on the river. Rhett and Bonnet's men fought {{each other for}} hours, but the outnumbered pirates ultimately surrendered. Rhett arrested the pirates and brought them to Charles Town in early October. Bonnet escaped on 24October, but was recaptured on Sullivan's Island. On 10November, Bonnet was brought to trial and charged with two acts of piracy. Judge Nicholas Trott sentenced Bonnet to death. Bonnet wrote to Governor Johnson to ask for clemency, but Johnson endorsed the judge's decision, and Bonnet was hanged in Charles Town on 10December 1718.|$|E
5|$|While searching a motel for supplies, L.J. is {{bitten by}} a zombie, which he keeps secret. The next morning the convoy is {{attacked}} by crows that had been feeding on the infected. The crows almost overwhelm the convoy, killing Nurse Betty and Otto and taking out the flamethrower operator, causing the weapon to <b>careen</b> out of control. Alice finally appears and saves Carlos and the others from a fiery death, using her telekinesis to fill the sky with fire, killing the crows and leaving her unconscious. After recovering, Alice is introduced to Claire and gives her the diary she found, and she and Carlos then convince Claire to take her convoy to Alaska.|$|E
5|$|Bonnet's initial cruise {{took him}} to the coast of the Colony of Virginia, near the {{entrance}} of the Chesapeake Bay, where he captured and plundered four vessels, and burned the Barbadian ship Turbet to keep news of his crimes from his home island. He then sailed north to New York City, taking two more ships, and picking up naval supplies and releasing captives at Gardiners Island. By August 1717, Bonnet had returned to the Carolinas, where he attacked two more ships, a brigantine from Boston and a Barbadian sloop. He stripped the brigantine, but brought the cargo-filled Barbadian sloop to an inlet off North Carolina to use for careening and repairing the Revenge. After the Barbadian sloop's tackle was used to <b>careen</b> the Revenge, the ship was dismantled for timber, and the remains were then burned. In September 1717, Bonnet set course for Nassau, which was then an infamous pirate den on the island of New Providence in the Bahamas. En route, he encountered, fought, and escaped from a Spanish man of war. The Revenge was badly damaged, Bonnet was seriously wounded, and half the crew of the sloop was killed or wounded in the encounter. Putting in at Nassau, Bonnet replaced his casualties and refitted the Revenge, increasing the sloop's armament to twelve guns.|$|E

25|$|Any failure by {{the catcher}} can have dire {{consequences}} for his team. Passed balls are possible whenever {{one or more}} runners are on base. A failure to catch a ball thrown from the outfield on a play at home plate, or a failure to tag a runner, means that the defensive team fails to record an all-important out and, instead, it allows a run. On an attempt to prevent a stolen base, a catcher's bad throw might <b>careen</b> past the infielder and skip into the outfield, allowing an additional advance by the baserunner.|$|E
25|$|After failed {{attacks against}} San Juan de Puerto Rico and Panamá, during which Francis Drake and John Hawkins had perished from dysentery, the English fleet {{anchored}} in Portobello to reorganize and <b>careen</b> their ships {{prior to return}} to England. Sir Thomas Baskerville, Colonel-General of the landing forces, was then elected by his officers as the new commander of the retreating fleet, whose number of ships soon decreased to 18, as two of them, the Delight and the Elizabeth, had to be burned or sunk {{due to lack of}} crew. Two generals, 15 captains and 22 officers had died in combat or from disease; a loss which demoralized the men on board.|$|E

25|$|Due to the tritium {{contamination}} at Byron, Braidwood and Dresden {{nuclear power}} plants in Illinois, the state government passed a law requiring power plants to report the release of radioactive contaminants into the soil, surface water or ground water to the state within 24hours. Before the law was passed, companies operating nuclear plants were only required to report such releases to the federal NRC. The law was introduced by Illinois State Representative <b>Careen</b> Gordon and State Senator Gary Dahl, and was signed by Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich on June 11, 2006 and became effective immediately upon his signature. The state government only {{found out about the}} tritium releases at the Exelon-owned plants after local officials near the Braidwood plant informed them. Following that revelation, other information about spills at Braidwood, Byron, and Dresden came to light. The state of Illinois contended that it was not informed of the leaks by Exelon in a timely manner. The law also required all Illinois {{nuclear power plants}} to submit to quarterly inspections by the IEPA and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency.|$|E
25|$|Clarice is apprehended by Hartman and, upon disparaging both him and {{his dead}} daughter, is {{shot in the head}} as the others watch from a distance. Jackson and Bud {{continue}} on with Elizabeth in tow. As a Deputy passes, Elizabeth screams out, inadvertently leading to Bud getting shot. Bud's death sends Jackson into a rage, as he kills the Deputy and has Elizabeth drive them in the deputy's vehicle in attempt to reach safety. During their drive, the two are pursued by the deranged Hartman, who opens fire on the two with one of the bullets severing Jackson's face and causing the vehicle to <b>careen</b> {{off the side of the}} road. Later that night, Elizabeth awakes handcuffed in Hartman's car and answers a dispatch call, alerting Sorells to her location. Sorells visits Verna and reveals to her that Hartman has Jedidiah at the old barn where Betty was killed. Verna feeds Sorells to her pigs and then gathers the family to converge on Hartman's location. At the barn, Hartman takes Elizabeth and the injured Jackson hostage, revealing that Jackson is Jedidiah Sawyer. Verna arrives and Hartman is soon incapacitated by the other Sawyers.|$|E

Lana sees Shachath in the back seat of the car and the man shoots himself in the head, causing the car to <b>careen</b> wildly. Lana wakes up in Briarcliff, having been returned there after the crash was discovered. She frantically tells Sister Mary Eunice that Kit is innocent and that Bloody Face is Thredson, urging her to tell the police. Sister Mary Eunice – who has known this all along – says she believes her, and tells her she is safe in Briarcliff.

[...] Teach's {{flotilla}} sailed northward along the Atlantic coast and into Topsail Inlet (commonly known as Beaufort Inlet), {{off the coast}} of North Carolina. [...] There they intended to <b>careen</b> their ships to scrape their hulls, but Queen Anne's Revenge ran aground on a sandbar, cracking her main-mast and severely damaging many of her timbers. [...] Teach ordered several sloops to throw ropes across the flagship in an attempt to free her.

The prophecy was that the Virgin Mary (referred to as Our Lady of Fatima), would appear and perform miracles on that date. Newspapers published testimony from reporters and other people who claimed to have witnessed extraordinary solar activity, such as the sun appearing to [...] "dance" [...] or zig-zag in the sky, <b>careen</b> towards the earth, or emit multicolored light and radiant colors.

Unable to pay the remaining of his troops, Hussain was forced to pawn his own artillery pieces to Ayyaz himself. Presumably, only either the hope of fresh reinforcements or fear of the reaction of the Sultan now prevented him from returning to Egypt.|$|E
