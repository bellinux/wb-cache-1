5|$|The Great New York City Fire of 1845 {{broke out}} on July 19, 1845. The fire started in a whale oil and candle {{manufacturing}} establishment and quickly {{spread to other}} wooden structures in New York City the neighborhood. It reached a warehouse on Broad Street where <b>combustible</b> saltpeter was stored and caused a massive explosion that spread the fire even farther.|$|E
5|$|A {{wildfire}} or {{wildland fire}} is {{a fire in}} an area of <b>combustible</b> vegetation that occurs in the countryside or rural area. Depending on the type of vegetation where it occurs, a wildfire can also be classified more specifically as a brush fire, bush fire, desert fire, forest fire, grass fire, hill fire, peat fire, vegetation fire, or veld fire. Fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants 420 million years ago. Wildfire’s occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna.|$|E
5|$|Heating {{oil shale}} to a {{sufficiently}} high temperature causes the chemical process of pyrolysis {{to yield a}} vapor. Upon cooling the vapor, the liquid shale oil—an unconventional oil—is separated from <b>combustible</b> oil-shale gas (the term shale gas can also refer to gas occurring naturally in shales). Oil shale can also be burned directly in furnaces as a low-grade fuel for power generation and district heating or used as a raw material in chemical and construction-materials processing.|$|E

5|$|Highly <b>combustible</b> {{materials}} that leave little residue, such as wood or coal, {{were thought to}} be made mostly of phlogiston; non-combustible substances that corrode, such as iron, contained very little. Air did not play a role in phlogiston theory, nor were any initial quantitative experiments conducted to test the idea; instead, it was based on observations of what happens when something burns, that most common objects appear to become lighter and seem to lose something in the process.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} fire, NASA convened the Apollo 204 Accident Review Board to {{determine}} the cause of the fire, and both houses of the United States Congress conducted their own committee inquiries to oversee NASA's investigation. The ignition source of the fire was determined to be electrical, and the fire spread rapidly due to <b>combustible</b> nylon material, and the high pressure, pure oxygen cabin atmosphere. The astronauts' rescue was prevented by the plug door hatch, which could not be opened against the higher internal pressure of the cabin. A failure to identify the test as hazardous (because the rocket was unfueled) led to the rescue being hampered by poor emergency preparedness.|$|E
5|$|Once the fleets {{were close}} enough, exchanges of {{missiles}} began, ranging from <b>combustible</b> projectiles to arrows and javelins. The aim {{was not to}} sink ships, but to deplete {{the ranks of the}} enemy crews before the boarding actions, which decided the outcome. Once the enemy strength was judged to have been reduced sufficiently, the fleets closed in, the ships grappled each other, and the marines and upper bank oarsmen boarded the enemy vessel and engaged in hand-to-hand combat.|$|E

5|$|Sardinia and Libya {{were already}} conquered by Marcellinus and Heraclius, when Basiliscus cast anchor off the Promontorium Mercurii, now Cap Bon, {{opposite}} Sicily, about forty miles from Carthage. Geiseric requested Basiliscus {{to allow him}} five days to draw up the conditions of a peace. During the negotiations, Geiseric gathered his ships and suddenly attacked the Roman fleet. The Vandals had filled many vessels with <b>combustible</b> materials. During the night, these fire ships were propelled against the unguarded and unsuspecting Roman fleet. The Roman commanders tried to rescue some ships from destruction, but these manoeuvres were blocked by the attack of other Vandal vessels.|$|E
5|$|The L191 (also {{formerly}} {{called the}} SS191) is a tracer cartridge designed for easier bullet spotting in dim light. <b>Combustible</b> chemicals packed {{in the rear}} of the L191 projectile create a light trail visible up to 200m (219yd). The L191 has been manufactured with red and red-on-black tips. The performance and trajectory of the L191 is identical to the SS190. For this reason, it is also classified by the ATF as armor-piercing handgun ammunition, and its sale is currently restricted by FN to military and law enforcement customers.|$|E
5|$|Welders {{are also}} often exposed to {{dangerous}} gases and particulate matter. GMAW produces smoke containing particles {{of various types}} of oxides, {{and the size of}} the particles in question tends to influence the toxicity of the fumes, with smaller particles presenting a greater danger. Additionally, carbon dioxide and ozone gases can prove dangerous if ventilation is inadequate. Furthermore, because the use of compressed gases in GMAW pose an explosion and fire risk, some common precautions include limiting the amount of oxygen in the air and keeping <b>combustible</b> materials away from the workplace.|$|E

5|$|After an oil {{drilling}} operation in 1903 in Dexter, Kansas, produced a gas geyser {{that would not}} burn, Kansas state geologist Erasmus Haworth collected samples of the escaping gas and took {{them back to the}} University of Kansas at Lawrence where, with the help of chemists Hamilton Cady and David McFarland, he discovered that the gas consisted of, by volume, 72% nitrogen, 15% methane (a <b>combustible</b> percentage only with sufficient oxygen), 1% hydrogen, and 12% an unidentifiable gas. With further analysis, Cady and McFarland discovered that 1.84% of the gas sample was helium. This showed that despite its overall rarity on Earth, helium was concentrated in large quantities under the American Great Plains, available for extraction as a byproduct of natural gas.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Albright and Wilson built a {{chemical}} {{works on the}} opposite side of the dock from the power stations. The chemical works produced white phosphorus from phosphate rock imported, through the docks, into the UK. Phosphate rock was stored in concrete silos on the dockside until it was required. Electricity provided by the local power stations was used to run six 7.5megawatt electric arc furnaces (45MW total) that reduced the phosphate rock. The phosphorus was then moved in sealed railway tanks to Oldbury and to Kirkby. After the closure of the factory the decontamination included the removal of yellow (spontaneously <b>combustible)</b> and red allotropes of phosphorus. The site is now home to Portishead volunteer coastguard.|$|E
5|$|Maintenance problems. The chain driven {{valve gear}} {{proved to be}} {{expensive}} to maintain and subject to rapid wear. Leaks from the oil bath onto the wheels caused oil to splash onto the boiler lagging in service. Once saturated with oil, the lagging attracted coal dust and ash which provided a <b>combustible</b> material, {{and as a result}} of the heavy braking of the locomotives, sparks would set the lagging on fire underneath the air-smoothed casing. The fires were also attributed to oil overflowing from axlebox lubricators onto the wheels when stationary to be flung upwards into the boiler lagging in service. In either case, the local fire brigade would invariably be called to put the fire out, with cold water coming into contact with the hot boiler, causing stress to the casing. Many photographs show an unmodified with 'buckled' (warped) casing, the result of a lagging fire.|$|E

40|$|The {{tendency}} for the jet engine rotor {{to continue to}} rotate after crash presents the probability that crash-spilled <b>combustibles</b> suspended in the air or puddled {{on the ground at}} the engine inlet may be sucked into the engine.

Experiment showed that the gas flow through the engine is too rapid to permit the ignition of ingested <b>combustibles</b> on the hot metal in contact with the main gas stream. Ignition will occur on those hot surfaces not in the main gas stream. The portion of the engine airflow is diverted for cooling and ventilation to these zones where the gas moves slowly enough for ignition to occur...|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, in 2004 the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board {{conducted}} a study into the risks presented by dust explosions after three fatal accidents in the year before. The West Pharmaceutical Services explosion killed six persons, the CTA Acoustics fiberglass insulation manufacturing plant explosion killed seven, and the Hayes Lemmerz automotive parts plant explosion killed one, prompting the report.

If the player chooses to engage, some environmental {{elements such as}} <b>combustible</b> objects {{can be used to}} alter an enemy's statistics and grand the player an advantage in battle. When battle begins, the three-character player party and the enemy party fight in a dedicated combat arena. The combat is governed by a turn-based battle system. Each character has access to melee and ranged standard attacks, can use items to affect the party or enemies, and guard against attacks. The player party's attacks are determined through button combinations, with different combinations triggering different attack sequences that can have secondary effects on the party and neighboring enemies. Attack combinations can be customized by the player between battles.|$|E
