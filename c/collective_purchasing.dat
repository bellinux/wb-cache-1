40|$|Compared to its {{neighboring}} countries, The Netherlands lags {{far behind}} in capacity of installed PV systems. A popular way for private customers {{to buy a}} residential PV system nowadays is the <b>collective</b> <b>purchase.</b> In this way, a price reduction {{can be achieved by}} bundling customers, and the hassle of selecting a suitable system and installation company is taken {{out of the hands of}} the customer. This report explores these <b>collective</b> <b>purchases.</b> A theoretical section on PV and in particular residential PV provides the necessary background, after which two <b>collective</b> <b>purchases</b> are analyzed: 5576 applications for a PV system resulted in 3675 orders with a combined power rating of 10. 1 MWp, and an average projected performance ratio of 0. 8, while a price reduction for customers of 11 - 33 % was achieved. The process of this <b>collective</b> <b>purchase</b> as well as details of the customers, their applications and orders is analyzed. A distinction is made between tilted and flat roofs. The impact on household scale for the average participant was a reduction of 50 % of the electricity bill (50 % of electricity consumed will be produced by the newly acquired solar system). Combined, the solar systems sold during the two <b>collective</b> <b>purchases</b> are projected to produce 187. 7 GWh of electricity over the next 25 years...|$|R

50|$|The {{origins of}} the Co-op lie {{with a group of}} activists brought {{together}} by the successful campaign against the construction of a nuclear power plant at Carnsore Point in County Wexford. In 1983, a number of those involved met together to form an organisation through which members could 'shop in an ecologically sound way' and 'promote the rational use of the earth's resources'. Thus, a buying club for the <b>collective</b> <b>purchase</b> of wholefoods was established. For one Saturday each month, the Co-op used a succession of locations in Temple Bar as a focal point to allow members to collect pre-ordered wholefoods and to socialise. In 1986 some members who were also producers began to provide fresh organic produce for sale directly at the Saturday events.|$|R

5000|$|When Copeland {{decided to}} sell the Grill, after feeling a {{religious}} calling to Christian seminary, individual employees he approached {{were not interested in}} buying. He considered some sort of group ownership, and began researching models found in The Cheeseboard Collective in Berkeley, California and the Mondragon cooperatives in the Basque region of Spain; key features of a collective being a vote for each owner, and share of profits apportioned according to labor input (not capital). In 2002, regular meetings began with Grill workers with an aim toward forming a worker-owned corporation—which would ultimately be called The Little Grill Cooperative.

40|$|The authors draw {{attention}} to the creative possibilities offered by <b>collective</b> <b>purchase</b> as a mechanism to move local and organic foods beyond the niche market. The food-buying group and cooperative style of food purchasing has received only scant reference in the alternative food and ethical consumption literatures, but it offers much in terms of historical context and future lessons for growth in the sector. `We can do it better' is an experimental ethic of the 1960 s and 1970 s counterculture, but it resonates strongly with the present-day `alternatives' associated with the local and organic food movement. The authors use Gibson-Graham's notion of `diverse economies' to examine selected buying groups and food cooperatives in North America, Europe, and Japan. The results reveal a highly pixilated and evolving mix of motivations and ethics. The `ideology first, practicalities later' approach appears to be a powerful influence, symbolising the `becomingness' of ethical purchasing in these contexts...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to analyze factors that can {{influence}} the competitiveness of companies in the furniture cluster of Bento Gonçalves, Rio Grande do Sul. By a literature review, we identify four factors that can influence competition in clusters: the region's productivity, innovation, relationship with suppliers, and cooperation between companies. The research method is the single case study. The research techniques are the review of specific bibliographic and documentation of the studied cluster, and interviews with experts of the cluster. The main findings are: the cluster has high productivity, mainly by hi-tech machinery employed by the main companies; innovation is permanent and motivated by the imposition to medium and short companies of business goals by the main companies; the relationship with suppliers is problematic regarding the large-scale vendors by the lack of the practice of <b>collective</b> <b>purchases</b> in the area; and cooperation between enterprises is small, by the culture of the region that don´t appreciate depending on resources available outside the companies. Such factors can contribute to produce hypotheses for further research...|$|R

Under the aegis of Borrow Direct, Engineering Librarians at seven member institutions have engaged in a pilot project to explore the <b>collective</b> <b>purchase</b> of ebooks via demand driven acquisition (DDA). While neither consortia ebook purchasing nor DDA are unique concepts, what is novel is that this pilot was undertaken without the benefit of a central organization to coordinate this endeavour.
