5|$|The Exchequer {{stood on}} an equal footing with the other Westminster courts (the Court of Common Pleas, Court of King's Bench and Court of Chancery), with cases {{transferred}} easily from one to another, although there were problems {{in the case of the}} Court of King's Bench. The traditional method for moving a case was the writ of supersedeas, but the King's Bench represented the monarch, who could not have writs placed against him. Instead, a clerk would bring the Red Book of the Exchequer to the King's Bench and assert that the case's claimant was an officer of the Exchequer, necessitating his trial there rather than in the King's Bench. The Exchequer maintained a clear rule with the other equity court, the Court of Chancery; a case heard in one could not be re-heard in the other. Apart from that, cases of equity could be heard by either court. The Exchequer had superior status over inferior <b>courts</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity,</b> able to take cases from them and countermand their decisions. The jurisdiction of ecclesiastical courts also overlapped with that of the Exchequer, particularly in relation to the collection of tithes, and there are many records of disputes between the two.|$|E

50|$|When a <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> is {{presented}} with a good claim to equitable relief, {{and it is clear}} that the plaintiff also sustained monetary damages, the <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> has jurisdiction to render legal relief, e.g., monetary damages.

25|$|In English common law, the {{fiduciary}} relation {{is an important}} concept within {{a part of the}} legal system known as equity.

25|$|Brandeis cites an old maxim of unclean hands, {{inherited}} from <b>courts</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity,</b> whereby a court will not redress a wrong when he who has requested its aid has unclean hands.

The Court established a new rule to determine the form of relief: Relief should serve the ends of justice, and should be withheld if it appears likely to produce hardship or injustice to either party.|$|E
25|$|After US courts merged law and equity, American law courts adopted {{many of the}} {{procedures}} of equity courts. The procedures {{in a court of}} equity were much more flexible than the courts at common law. In American practice, certain devices such as joinder, counterclaim, cross-claim and interpleader originated in the <b>courts</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity.</b> Also, the modern class action evolved out of the equitable doctrine of virtual representation, which enabled a court of equity to fully dispose of an estate even though it might contain contingent interests held by persons over which the court did not have direct jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|This tension climaxed in the Earl of Oxford's case (1615) where a {{judgment}} of Chief Justice Coke was allegedly obtained by fraud. The Lord Chancellor, Lord Ellesmere, issued a common injunction from the Chancery prohibiting {{the enforcement of}} the common law order. The two courts became locked in a stalemate, and the matter was eventually referred to the Attorney-General, Sir Francis Bacon. Sir Francis, by authority of King James I, upheld the use of the common injunction and concluded that in the event of any conflict between the common law and equity, equity would prevail. Equity's primacy in England was later enshrined in the Judicature Acts of the 1870s, which also served to fuse the <b>courts</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> and the common law (although emphatically not the systems themselves) into one unified court system.|$|E
5|$|The Court's {{right to}} give damages was reiterated in Phelps v Prothero in 1855, where the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Appeal in Chancery held {{that if a}} {{plaintiff}} starts an action in a <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> for specific performance and damages are also appropriate, the <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> may choose to award damages. This authorisation was limited to certain circumstances, and was again not regularly used. Eventually, the Chancery Amendment Act 1858 gave the Court full jurisdiction to award damages; the situation before that was so limited that lawyers at the time commented as if the Court had not previously {{been able to do}} so.|$|R

25|$|The {{duty of care}} owed by {{trustees}} and fiduciaries has its partner in the common law of negligence, and was also long recognised by <b>courts</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity.</b> Millett LJ, however, in Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew emphasised that although recognised in equity, and applicable to fiduciaries, the duty of care is not itself a fiduciary duty, like the rule against conflicts of interest. This means that like ordinary negligence actions, the common law requirements for proving causation of loss apply, and the remedy for breach of duty is of compensation for losses rather than restitution of gains. In Mothew this meant that a solicitor (who occupies a fiduciary position, like a trustee) who negligently told a building society that its client had no second mortgage was not liable for the loss in the property's value after the client defaulted. Mr Mothew successfully argued that Bristol & West would have granted the loan in any case, and so his advice did not cause their loss.|$|E
25|$|English {{trust law}} {{concerns}} {{the creation and}} protection of asset funds, which are usually held by one party for another's benefit. Trusts were a creation of the English law of property and obligations, but also share a history with countries across the Commonwealth and the United States. Trusts developed when claimants in property disputes were dissatisfied with the common law courts and petitioned the King for a just and equitable result. On the King's behalf, the Lord Chancellor developed a parallel justice system in the Court of Chancery. Historically, trusts were mostly used where people left money in a will, created family settlements, created charities, or some types of business venture. After the Judicature Act 1873, England's <b>courts</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> and common law were merged, and equitable principles took precedence. Today, trusts {{play an important role}} in financial investments, especially in unit trusts and pension trusts, where trustees and fund managers usually invest assets for people who wish to save for retirement. Although people are generally free to write trusts in any way they like, an increasing number of statutes are designed to protect beneficiaries, or regulate the trust relationship, including the Trustee Act 1925, Trustee Investments Act 1961, Recognition of Trusts Act 1987, Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, Trustee Act 2000, Pensions Act 1995, Pensions Act 2004 and the Charities Act 2011.|$|E
25|$|When {{trustees}} fail {{in their}} main duties, the law imposes remedies {{according to the}} nature of the breach. In general, breaches of rules surrounding performance of the trust's terms can be remedied through an award of specific performance, or compensation. Breaches of the duty of care will trigger a right to compensation. Breaches of the duty to avoid conflicts of interest, and misapplications of property will give rise to a restitutionary claim, to restore the property taken away. In these last two situations, the <b>courts</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> developed further principles of liability that could be applied even when a trustee had gone bankrupt. Some recipients of property that came from a breach of trust, as well as people who had assisted in a breach of trust, might incur liability. Equity recognised not merely a personal, but also a proprietary claim over assets taken in breach of trust, and perhaps also profits made in breach of the duty of loyalty. A proprietary claim meant that the claimant could demand the thing in priority to other creditors of the bankrupt trustee. Alternatively, the courts would follow an asset or trace its value if the trust property was exchanged for some other asset. If trust property had been given to a third party, the trust fund could claim back the property as of right, unless the recipient was a bona fide purchaser. Generally, any recipient of trust property who knew about the breach of trust (or maybe ought to have known) could be made to give back the value, even if they had themselves exchanged the thing for other assets. Lastly, against people who may never have received trust property but had assisted in a breach of trust, and had done so dishonestly, a claim arose to return the property's value.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} {{consequence of}} the amalgamation of the superior common-law courts with the <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> (Chancery) was that, for the first time, the previously separate systems of common law and equity were merged.|$|R

2500|$|However, {{the system}} became overly systematized—overly rigid and inflexible. [...] As a result, {{as time went}} on, {{increasing}} numbers of citizens petitioned the King to override the common law, and on the King's behalf the Lord Chancellor gave judgment {{to do what was}} equitable in a case. From the time of Sir Thomas More, the first lawyer to be appointed as Lord Chancellor, a systematic body of equity grew up alongside the rigid common law, and developed its own Court of Chancery. At first, equity was often criticized as erratic, that it varied according to the length of the Chancellor's foot. Over time, <b>courts</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> developed solid principles, especially under Lord Eldon. In the 19th century in England, and in 1937 in the U.S., the two systems were merged.|$|E

2500|$|Justice Field {{concluded}} that contract law usually required courts {{to apply the}} terms of the contract as specified. But relief in cases of equity is a matter of discretion: [...] "When a contract is of this character, it is the usual practice of <b>courts</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> to enforce its specific execution upon the application of the party who has complied with its stipulations on his part or has seasonably and in good faith offered and continues ready to comply with them. But it is not the invariable practice. This form of relief {{is not a matter of}} absolute right to either party; it is a matter resting in the discretion of the court, to be exercised upon a consideration of all the circumstances of each particular case." [...] That the initial contract was a fair one was not in dispute, Field noted: The sale price ($22,500) was much higher than the assessed value ($15,000), and no one could have foreseen that property values would more than double over the next 10 years.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first was}} the nature of the [...] "cash" [...] which the {{contract}} specified be used as the down payment in 1854. Justice Field concluded that [...] "cash" [...] meant gold coin, as no other form of legal tender existed in 1854. The creation of paper currency subsequent to the 1854 contract did not alleviate Willard of the requirement that the down payment be made in [...] "cash" [...] (e.g., gold coin), Field held. But the issue did not end there. Had Willard acted in good faith in offering the U.S. Notes? [...] If not, then no relief was likely: The contract had expired, and Willard had not acted in a timely fashion to secure his rights under it by submitting a cash down-payment. But if he had acted in good faith, then Willard would be able to seek relief from <b>courts</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity.</b> The constitutionality of the National Banking Act was not at issue, the Court said, because the issue before the Court was not whether paper currency constituted [...] "cash" [...] but whether Willard acted in good faith (e.g., had assumed in good faith that U.S. Notes constitute cash, as Congress had said they did). Field laid out extensive reasons for why Willard had acted in good faith: ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{resulting}} trust is usually recognised when {{one person has}} given property to another person without the intention to benefit them. The recipient will be declared by the court to be a [...] "{{resulting trust}}ee" [...] so that the equitable property right returns to the person it came from. For some time, the <b>courts</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> required proof of a positive intention before they would acknowledge the passing of a gift, primarily {{as a way to}} prevent fraud. If one person transferred property to another, unless there was positive evidence that {{it was meant to be}} a gift, it would be presumed that the recipient held the property on trust for the transferee. It was also recognised that if money was transferred as part of the purchase of land or a house, the transferee would acquire an equitable interest in the land under a resulting trust. On the other hand, if evidence clearly showed a gift was intended, then a gift would be acknowledged. In Fowkes v Pascoe, an old lady named Mrs Baker had bought Mr Pascoe some company stocks, because she had become endeared to him and treated him like a grandson. When she died, the executor, Mr Fowkes, argued that Mr Pascoe held the stocks on resulting trust for the estate, but the Court of Appeal said the fact that the lady had put the stocks in Mr Pascoe's name was absolutely conclusive. The presumption of a resulting trust was rebutted.|$|E
