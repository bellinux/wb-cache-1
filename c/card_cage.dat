5|$|The NWA World Heavyweight and World Tag Team Championships were contested for in TNA {{until the}} morning of May 13, 2007. On that day, NWA's Executive Director Robert Trobich {{announced}} that the NWA were ending their five-year agreement with TNA, which had allowed them full control over both titles. Trobich went on to state that effective that morning, then-NWA World Heavyweight Champion Christian Cage and then-NWA World Tag Team Champions Team 3D were stripped of their respective championships. The alleged motivation behind these actions was because Cage refused to defend the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against wrestlers from NWA territories. That same day, TNA were scheduled to produce their Sacrifice event, in which both Cage and Team 3D were to defend their respective championships. On the <b>card,</b> <b>Cage</b> was scheduled to defend the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Kurt Angle and Sting in a match involving three competitors, {{also known as a}} three-way match.|$|E

25|$|The {{maximum width}} of a PCI card is 15.24mm (0.6inches). Two bracket heights have been specified, known as full-height and low-profile. The bracket or {{backplate}} is the part that fastens to the <b>card</b> <b>cage</b> to stabilize the card. It also usually contains external connectors, so it attaches in a window in the computer case so any connectors are accessible from outside. The backplate is typically fixed to the case by either a 6-32 or M3 screw, or with a separate hold-down bracket {{that is part of}} the case.|$|E

50|$|Moving on, PC systems did {{away with}} the need for <b>card</b> <b>cages</b> and {{backplanes}} by moving to the PC104 format where boards stack onto each other. While not as well designed as the STEbus, PC104 is good enough for many applications.|$|R
50|$|Below the <b>card</b> <b>cages</b> was {{the cooling}} system, which took {{up most of}} the volume in the cabinet. The bottom of the cabinet {{contained}} a provisions for an optional battery backup unit and two RA90 or RA92 hard disk drives. The battery backup unit could provide power to the system for one second {{in the event of a}} power failure, after which the system ceased to operate, but continued to preserve the data in the cache and memory for ten minutes.|$|R
500|$|When {{the first}} {{location}} opened in 1977, the animatronic characters were featured in framed portraits {{hanging on the}} walls of the main dining area, but they are no longer in use today. The show featured Crusty The Cat (the first character to face retirement as he was soon replaced with Mr. Munch in 1978), Pasqually the singing chef, Jasper T. Jowls, the Warblettes, and the main focus of the show, Chuck E. Cheese. Later, restaurants also added [...] "Cabaret" [...] shows in separate rooms of each restaurant. They also frequently changed out the sole female character, currently named Helen Henny, in the main show. They achieved this by applying a cosmetic change to the existing robot, as well as a change of stage backdrop, to match the performer. The in-house control system which consisted of a 6502-based controller in a <b>card</b> <b>cage</b> with various driver boards was called [...] "Cyberamics".|$|E

50|$|Electronic {{packaging}} {{is a major}} discipline {{within the}} field of electronic engineering, and includes a wide variety of technologies. It refers to enclosures and protective features built into the product itself, and not to shipping containers. It applies both to end products and to components. Packaging of an electronic system must consider protection from mechanical damage, cooling, radio frequency noise emission, protection from electrostatic discharge, maintenance, operator convenience, and cost. Prototypes and industrial equipment made in small quantities may use standardized commercially available enclosures such as <b>card</b> <b>cages</b> or prefabricated boxes. Mass-market consumer devices may have highly specialized packaging to increase consumer appeal. The same electronic system may be packaged as a portable device or adapted for fixed mounting in an instrument rack or permanent installation. Packaging for aerospace, marine, or military systems imposes different types of design criteria.|$|R

50|$|Level C was a <b>card</b> <b>cage</b> and S-100 bus {{expander}} card. This card would plug {{into one of}} the S-100 bus sockets on the motherboard. You could then plug up to five more S-100 bus cards into the expander card. One of the two original slots on the motherboard was still available for use, giving the Level C Explorer 85 a capacity of six S-100 bus cards. The <b>card</b> <b>cage</b> held all of the cards in place. In 1982 the Level C upgrade sold for $39.95, and $4.85 for each S-100 bus connector.|$|E

5000|$|The Multibus {{specification}} {{was important}} {{because it was a}} robust, well-thought out industry standard with a relatively large form factor, so complex devices could be designed on it. Because it was a well-defined and well-documented industry standard, it allowed a Multibus-compatible industry to grow around it, with many companies making <b>card</b> <b>cages</b> and enclosures for it. Many others made CPU, memory, and other peripheral boards. In 1982 there were over 100 Multibus board and systems manufacturers. [...] This allowed complex systems to be built from commercial off-the-shelf hardware, and also allowed companies to innovate by designing a proprietary Multibus board and then integrating it with other vendors' hardware to create a system. A good example of this was Sun Microsystems with their Sun 1 and Sun 2 workstations. Sun built custom-designed CPU, memory, SCSI, and video display boards, and then added 3Com Ethernet networking boards, Xylogics SMD disk controllers, Ciprico Tapemaster 1/2 inch tape controllers, Sky Floating Point Processor, and Systech 16-port Terminal Interfaces in order to configure the system as a workstation or a file server. Other workstation vendors who used Multibus-based designs included HP/Apollo and Silicon Graphics IRIS.|$|R
50|$|One is the PCMCIA module. There {{were three}} versions; RevA, RevB and RevC. The RevC {{is the most}} useful as it can take 16bit WiFi cards, {{allowing}} the possibility to get a Powerbook 5xx connected online or in the home network using a technology that was developed after the Powerbook 5xx's were discontinued by Apple. The different revisions of the PCMCIA module were released by Apple to accommodate the developing PCMCIA standard. These modules are difficult to find, and the RevC module is in particular demand because it alone works with 16-bit WiFi cards.

He fought and quickly defeated Johnathan Tsosie, an 0-3 fighter at the time, only eighteen seconds into round one. In April 2006, Griggs took his second fight against UFC veteran Homer Moore, on a Rage in the <b>Cage</b> <b>card.</b> Griggs again won via TKO.|$|R
5000|$|An {{extender}} board (or board extender, card extender, extender card) is {{a simple}} circuit board that interposes between a <b>card</b> <b>cage</b> backplane and the circuit board of interest to physically 'extend' the circuit board of interest out from the <b>card</b> <b>cage</b> allowing access to {{both sides of the}} circuit board to connect diagnostic equipment such as an oscilloscope or systems analyzer. For example, a PCI extender board can be plugged into a PCI slot on a computer motherboard, and then a PCI card connected to the extender board to 'extend' the board into free space for access. This approach was common in the 1970s and 1980s particularly on S-100 bus systems.|$|E
50|$|The PPC {{included}} standard connectors for RS-232, Centronics and CGA/MDA video, allowing existing peripherals to be used.

5000|$|As a mixed martial artist, Westbrook competes in {{the heavyweight}} (206-265 lbs.) division. He fought once in 2005 and {{defeated}} fellow NFL veteran Jarrod Bunch {{in the main}} event of a King of the Cage event in Cleveland, Ohio.After the Bunch fight, Westbrook was inactive for four years; and his return to professional MMA was less successful than his debut. In February, 2009, Travis Browne defeated Westbrook in San Bernardino, California, by technical knockout in the third round. [...] In July 2009, Westbrook squared off against Nick Gaston in the main event of a King of the <b>Cage</b> <b>card</b> in Lac du Flambeau, Wisconsin.

Appearance of the animal, social behavior with adopter, and personality were the top reasons for adoption across species and age groups. Most adopters stated that information about the animal from a staff member or volunteer was more important than information on <b>cage</b> <b>cards,</b> and health and behavior information was particularly important. Adopters found greater importance in interacting with the animal rather than viewing it in its kennel. The results of this study can be used by shelters to create better adoption matches, prioritize shelter resources and staff training, and potentially increase adoptions. Additionally, some simple training techniques are suggested to facilitate adopter-friendly behaviors from sheltered dogs and cats...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} and performance {{requirements of a}} backplane will define its physical layout and size. When the minimum physical structure requirements are known, the form factor can be selected. Application and performance requirements also help the designer decide if the backplane will be a full custom design, a completely packaged protocol, or some point in between. Performance requirements will also define minimum requirements for chassis or <b>cage,</b> <b>card</b> selection, and backplane connectors. The cage or chassis is the physical support system used to secure cards to the backplane. Connectors join the cards physically and electrically to the backplane. The card size selected will determine the spacing between cards and overall size of the backplane. Therefore, card size has a direct effect on backplane performance. The type of connector used can affect signal integrity because connectors have capacitance, increased rise time and flight time, increased noise (EMI and cross-talk), and effects on power consumption...|$|R
40|$|The mouse N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) {{mutagenesis}} {{program at}} the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation (GNF) uses MouseTRACS to analyze phenotype screens and manage animal husbandry. MouseTRACS is a Web-based laboratory informatics system that electronically records and organizes mouse colony operations, prints <b>cage</b> <b>cards,</b> tracks inventory, manages requests, and reports Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) protocol usage. For efficient phenotype screening, MouseTRACS identifies mutants, visualizes data, and maps mutations. It displays and integrates phenotype and genotype data using likelihood odds ratio (LOD) plots of genetic linkage between genotype and phenotype. More detailed mapping intervals show individual single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers {{in the context of}} phenotype. In addition, dynamically generated pedigree diagrams and inventory reports linked to screening results summarize the inheritance pattern and the degree of penetrance. MouseTRACS displays screening data in tables and uses standard charts such as box plots, histograms, scatter plots, and customized charts looking at clustered mice or cross pedigree comparisons. In summary, MouseTRACS enables the efficient screening, analysis, and management of thousands of animals to find mutant mice and identify novel gene functions.

40|$|Toe {{clipping}} {{is used as}} {{a method}} of identifying small rodents by using a predetermined numbering code 1 and may simultaneously be used as a method to obtain biopsy tissue for genotyping. It should only be used in pre-weaning rodents. Other methods of rodent identification include <b>cage</b> <b>cards,</b> colored stains, ear notches, punches or tags, tattoos and subcutaneous transponders. Although the “toe clipping ” method of animal identification has been considered to be a painful procedure producing a potentially long term impact on behavior, recently it was reported 2, 3 that toe clipping produces no more acute pain or distress than other commonly used rodent identification procedures when performed on mice from five to seven days of age. These studies also reported no long term effects of this procedure in test batteries evaluating physical and behavioral development. Despite these recent findings, a principal investigator must continue to justify to the Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) that no other methods of identifying the animal are feasible as required by the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals 4. The ACUC must also be satisfied that the procedure will be performed in the most painless and humane way possible and that all accepted veterinary procedures ar...|$|R

Styles, James Storm, and Team 3D). The {{duration}} of the contest was 26 minutes and 45 seconds. A Lethal Lockdown match is fought under no disqualification rules, in which weapons are legal and one wrestler from each team starts the match in the cage. Afterwards, members from each team enter at time intervals until all wrestlers {{are involved in the}} bout so a pinfall or submission can occur. Cage and Styles started the match. Brother Ray, Rhino, Storm, Nash, Brother Devon, Morgan, Tomko, and Sting were the order of entrances for the contest. Shortly after Sting's entrance, a roof covered in weapons was lowered onto the cage. With Sting's participation all men were involved in the match, as such a pinfall or submission could now occur. During the encounter, Cage set up a table on top of the roof of the cage. Later, he and Styles were fighting on top of a ladder on top of the cage, when Storm pushed over the ladder causing them both to crash through the table. Storm then climbed down from the roof into the cage, where Rhino tackled and pinned him to secure the victory for Team Cage.|$|R
