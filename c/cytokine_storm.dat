5|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} explanations for the high mortality rate of the 1918 influenza pandemic. Some {{research suggests that the}} specific variant of the virus had an unusually aggressive nature. One group of researchers recovered the original virus from the bodies of frozen victims, and found that transfection in animals caused a rapid progressive respiratory failure and death through a <b>cytokine</b> <b>storm</b> (overreaction of the body's immune system). It was then postulated that the strong immune reactions of young adults ravaged the body, whereas the weaker immune systems of children and middle-aged adults resulted in fewer deaths among those groups.|$|E

40|$|Current {{research}} in immunology shows that parasite evasion of host immunity is ubiquitous and involves {{a wide range}} of molecular mechanisms. Furthermore, immune evasion appears to generate a large spectrum of pathogenic effects, such as <b>cytokine</b> <b>storms</b> and inflammation. Understanding the relationships between the beneficial effects of immune evasion and its pathogenic consequences therefore provides a new framework to reassess many of the core questions of the evolutionary ecology of host–parasite interactions, such as the evolution of virulence, immune defence strategies, infective dose and host specificity, and to address questions that thus far could not be satisfactorily analysed...|$|R

25|$|By contrast, superantigens do {{not require}} {{processing}} by antigen-presenting cells but instead interact directly with the invariant region of the class II MHC molecule. In patients with TSS, up to 20% of the body's T-cells can be activated at one time. This polyclonal T-cell population causes a <b>cytokine</b> <b>storm,</b> followed by a multisystem disease. The toxin in S. aureus infections is TSS Toxin-1, or TSST-1. The TSST-1 is secreted as a single polypeptide chain.|$|E

500|$|This huge {{death toll}} {{was caused by}} an {{extremely}} high infection rate of up to 50% and the extreme severity of the symptoms, suspected {{to be caused by}} <b>cytokine</b> <b>storms.</b> Symptoms in 1918 were so unusual that initially influenza was misdiagnosed as dengue, cholera, or typhoid. One observer wrote, [...] "One of the most striking of the complications was hemorrhage from mucous membranes, especially from the nose, stomach, and intestine.

50|$|The <b>cytokine</b> <b>storm</b> is the {{systemic}} {{expression of a}} healthy and vigorous immune system resulting in the release of more than 150 known inflammatory mediators (cytokines, oxygen free radicals, and coagulation factors). Both pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, Interleukin-1, and Interleukin-6) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (such as interleukin 10 and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist) are elevated in the serum of patients experiencing a <b>cytokine</b> <b>storm.</b>|$|E
30|$|Another {{area that}} has not yet been fully {{investigated}} with respect to T cell redirection is the role of Fc functionality. The Triomab® platform, on which Removab® is designed, has a highly active Fc domain that interacts with human FcγRs to increase the immune response (Chelius et al., 2010; Hess et al., 2012). On the other hand, most of the current fragment-Fc, asymmetric IgG, or appended IgG platforms have used muted or silenced Fcs so as not to over stimulate the immune system via interactions with myeloid effector cells. Even with the absence of Fc activity, many treatments with T cell redirecting bispecific antibodies are accompanied by <b>cytokine</b> <b>storms</b> {{that need to be addressed}} as part of the therapeutic paradigm (Lee et al., 2016). Thus, it seems likely that most T cell redirecting antibodies made in the future will continue to avoid Fc activity in an effort to limit the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by T cells and other effector cells in the tumor microenvironment.|$|R
40|$|Background - Herpes simplex virus (HSV) {{infection}} carries one of {{the poorest}} outcomes of neonatal liver failure (NLF). Neonates with disseminated HSV infection can develop hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), and occasionally need orthotopic liver transplantation. Early interventions may be critical for the cure of NLF. Case Report - We describe herewith a 6 -day-old neonate with fulminant hepatic failure due to disseminated HSV- 1 infection, who successfully responded to high-dose corticosteroid therapy 72 hours after the onset of disease. Preceding acyclovir, gamma globulin, and exchange blood transfusion therapies failed to control the disease. Methylprednisolone pulse therapy led to a drastic improvement of liver function and <b>cytokine</b> <b>storms,</b> and prevented the disease progression to HLH. Sustained levels of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid HSV DNA declined after prolonged acyclovir therapy. Bilateral lesions of the periventricular white matter areas, assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, disappeared at 3 months of age. The infant showed normal growth and development at 4 years of age. Conclusion - Early anti-hypercytokinemia therapy using corticosteroid, and prolonged antiviral therapy might only provide the transplantation-free cure of NLF with HSV dissemination...|$|R

40|$|There is {{currently}} {{growing interest in}} retargeting of effector T cells to tumor cells via bispecific antibodies (bsAbs). Usually, bsAbs are directed {{on the one hand}} to the CD 3 complex of T cells {{and on the other hand}} to a molecule expressed on the surface of the target cell. A bsAb-mediated cross-linkage via CD 3 leads to an activation of CD 8 + T cells and consequently to killing of the target cells. In parallel, CD 4 + T cells including TH 1, TH 2, TH 17 cells and even regulatory T cells (Tregs) will be activated as well. Cytokines produced by CD 4 + T cells can contribute to severe side effects e. g. life-threatening <b>cytokine</b> <b>storms</b> and, thinking of the immunosupressive function of Tregs, can even be counterproductive. Therefore, we asked whether or not it is feasible to limit retargeting to CD 8 + T cells e. g. via targeting of the co-receptor CD 8 instead of CD 3. In order to test for proof of concept, a novel bsAb with specificity for CD 8 and a tumor-associated surface antigen was constructed. Interestingly, we found that pre-activated (but not freshly isolated) CD 8 + T cells can be retargeted via CD 8 -engaging bsAbs leading to an efficient lysis of target cells...|$|R

50|$|While eritoran did {{not perform}} well in the {{treatment}} of sepsis, it was shown to combat another, related phenomenon called <b>cytokine</b> <b>storm</b> in influenza cases involving certain virus strains (involving preliminary experimentation on mice, not in other animals or humans, led by a University of Maryland School of Medicine researcher).A further study in mice and rats by the same group showed it prevented acute lung injury. A <b>cytokine</b> <b>storm</b> can help to cause sepsis and can in concert with it or by itself cause serious illness or death if not soon controlled. Mortality rates for sepsis, <b>cytokine</b> <b>storm,</b> and especially septic shock and organ dysfunction are still quite high despite progress made. This is in no small part due to the prevalence of nosocomial (hospital-acquired) infections, as well as ongoing mutations which confer multi-drug resistance in pathological microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses (most strains of flu are resistant to amantadine and rimantadine, and some are resistant to oseltamivir), and delays and mistakes in the recognition and treatment of disease. New flu strains, such as the H7N9 strain, are always emerging.|$|E
40|$|Pulmonary {{exposure}} to the plant toxin ricin leads to respiratory insufficiency and death. To date, in-depth study of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) following pulmonary {{exposure to}} toxins is hampered {{by the lack of}} an appropriate animal model. To this end, we established the pig as a large animal model for the comprehensive study of the multifarious clinical manifestations of pulmonary ricinosis. Here, we report for the first time, the monitoring of barometric whole body plethysmography for pulmonary function tests in non-anesthetized ricin-treated pigs. Up to 30  h post-exposure, as a result of progressing hypoxemia and to prevent carbon dioxide retention, animals exhibited a compensatory response of elevation in minute volume, attributed mainly to a large elevation in respiratory rate with minimal response in tidal volume. This response was followed by decompensation, manifested by a decrease in minute volume and severe hypoxemia, refractory to oxygen treatment. Radiological evaluation revealed evidence of early diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates while hemodynamic parameters remained unchanged, excluding cardiac failure as an explanation for respiratory insufficiency. Ricin-intoxicated pigs suffered from increased lung permeability accompanied by <b>cytokine</b> <b>storming.</b> Histological studies revealed lung tissue insults that accumulated over time and led to diffuse alveolar damage. Charting the decline in PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio in a mechanically ventilated pig confirmed that ricin-induced respiratory damage complies with the accepted diagnostic criteria for ARDS. The establishment of this animal model of pulmonary ricinosis should help in the pursuit of efficient medical countermeasures specifically tailored to deal with the respiratory deficiencies stemming from ricin-induced ARDS...|$|R

A prospective observational study from a cohort of adult sepsis patients admitted to ICU between August 2013 and June 2016 at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan. We evaluated immune dysfunction status through measurement of baseline plasma Cytokine levels, Monocyte human leukocyte-DR expression by flow cytometry, and stimulated immune response using post LPS stimulated cytokine elevation ratio. An immune dysfunction score was created for 28 -day mortality prediction and was validated. A total of 151 patients were enrolled. Data of the first consecutive 106 septic patients comprised the training cohort, and of other 45 patients comprised the validation cohort. Among the 106 patients, 21 died and 85 were still alive on day 28 after ICU admission. (mortality rate, 19. 8 %). Independent predictive factors revealed via {{multivariate logistic regression analysis}} included segmented neutrophil-to-monocyte ratio, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, interleukin- 10, and monocyte human leukocyte antigen-antigen D-related levels, all of which were selected to construct the score, which predicted 28 -day mortality with area under the curve of 0. 853 and 0. 789 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively.

40|$|Most {{therapeutic}} monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) licensed {{for human}} use or in clinical development are indicated {{for treatment of}} patients with cancer and inflammatory/autoimmune disease and as such, are designed to directly interact with the immune system. A major hurdle for the development and early clinical investigation {{of many of these}} immunomodulatory mAbs is their inherent risk for adverse immune-mediated drug reactions in humans such as infusion reactions, <b>cytokine</b> <b>storms,</b> immunosuppression and autoimmunity. A thorough understanding of the immunopharmacology of a mAb in humans and animals is required to both anticipate the clinical risk of adverse immunotoxicological events and to select a safe starting dose for first-in-human (FIH) clinical studies. This review summarizes the most common adverse immunotoxicological events occurring in humans with immunomodulatory mAbs and outlines non-clinical strategies to define their immunopharmacology and assess their immunotoxic potential, as well as reduce the risk of immunotoxicity through rational mAb design. Tests to assess the relative risk of mAb candidates for cytokine release syndrome, innate immune system (dendritic cell) activation and immunogenicity in humans are also described. The importance of selecting a relevant and sensitive toxicity species for human safety assessment in which the immunopharmacology of the mAb is similar to that expected in humans is highlighted, as is the importance of understanding the limitations of the species selected for human safety assessment and supplementation of in vivo safety assessment with appropriate in vitro human assays. A tiered approach to assess effects on immune status, immune function and risk of infection and cancer, governed by the mechanism of action and structural features of the mAb, is described. Finally, the use of immunopharmacology and immunotoxicity data in determining a minimum anticipated biologic effect Level (MABEL) and in the selection of safe human starting dose is discussed...|$|R
