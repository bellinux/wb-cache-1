5|$|July 1992: The {{remnants}} of Hurricane Darby caused <b>cloudiness</b> in California. These clouds were also enough {{to delay the}} landing of the Space Shuttle Columbia for a day, and cause it to land in Florida instead of California.|$|E
5|$|Cold fronts may feature narrow {{bands of}} {{thunderstorms}} and severe weather, and may on occasion be preceded by squall lines or dry lines. Warm fronts are usually preceded by stratiform precipitation and fog. The weather usually clears quickly after a front's passage. Some fronts produce no precipitation and little <b>cloudiness,</b> {{although there is}} invariably a wind shift.|$|E
5|$|Cataracts {{can affect}} any breed of dog {{and is the}} same {{condition}} as seen in humans. Here {{the lens of the}} eye hardens and is characterised by <b>cloudiness</b> in the eye. Cataracts will blur the dog's vision and can lead to permanent blindness if left untreated. While considered mainly a hereditary disease, it can also be caused by diabetes, old age, radiation, eye injury or exposure to high temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Rick's {{ultimate}} origin was {{a tropical}} wave that left Africa on October 15. While crossing the Atlantic, the wave was mainly tracked by continuity {{due to its}} lack or organization. After entering the Pacific, part of it developed <b>cloudiness</b> on November 5 when it was south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Organization and a circulation developed, and satellite tracking began on November 6. The disturbance became better organized and formed into Tropical Depression Nineteen-E on November 7.|$|E
5|$|Since Bret {{remained}} {{over the}} open Atlantic {{for most of}} its existence, its effects on land were limited. While moving little, the storm produced inclement weather and widespread <b>cloudiness</b> over much of the north-central Bahamas. Squalls off the eastern coast of Florida generated rough seas along coastlines, injuring a number of people. Although it stayed well offshore, the storm enhanced tropical moisture over Bermuda, causing beneficial rainfall in dry areas.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave moving westward off the African coast on October 1, 2001 {{entered the}} tropical Atlantic. The wave's organization changed little until October 4 {{as it moved}} westward, when curved banding features began to increase. However, little improvement in the wave's organization occurred until October 6 after continuing to move westward for two days, when an {{area of low pressure}} was identified by the National Hurricane Center. Afterward, the <b>cloudiness</b> became more concentrated, and the system organized into a tropical depression by noon on October 6, shortly after the first advisory from the NHC was issued at 11 a.m. AST.|$|E
5|$|Early on August28, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began {{monitoring}} {{an unusually}} vigorous tropical wavean elongated area of low air pressureinland over West Africa. Trailed by widespread <b>cloudiness,</b> the wave tracked {{toward the open}} Atlantic as it developed a broad cyclonic rotation within the lower atmosphere near Guinea's coastline. The disturbance veered toward the northwest and entered the ocean off Conakry around 18:00UTC, August29. By that time, the NHC was predicting a favorable environment for tropical cyclone development within the next 48hours; heavy thunderstorms thrived overnight and consolidated near a well-defined low-pressure center. Around midnight August30, satellite images and scatterometer data confirmed that a tropical depression had formed about 300miles (480km) west-northwest of Conakry, with wind speeds of 35mph (55km/h).|$|E
5|$|Extratropical cyclones, {{sometimes}} called mid-latitude cyclones or wave cyclones, are low-pressure areas which, {{along with the}} anticyclones of high-pressure areas, drive the weather {{over much of the}} Earth. Extratropical cyclones are capable of producing anything from <b>cloudiness</b> and mild showers to heavy gales, thunderstorms, blizzards, and tornadoes. These types of cyclones are defined as large scale (synoptic) low pressure weather systems that occur in the middle latitudes of the Earth. In contrast with tropical cyclones, extratropical cyclones produce rapid changes in temperature and dew point along broad lines, called weather fronts, about the center of the cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Lily was a {{short-lived}} Category 1 hurricane of August 1971 that devastated {{the city of}} Puerto Vallarta in Mexico. Forming from an area of <b>cloudiness</b> associated with former Atlantic Tropical Storm Chloe, the storm slowly intensified, building to peak intensity just before landfall northwest of Manzanillo, Colima on August 31. The hurricane quickly weakened and became extratropical. After leaving land, the extratropical remnants of Lily dissipated on September 1. The storm's movement close to land affected shipping due to the limited warning, which was partially set back due to difficulties in clarifying the hurricane's position on radar from reconnaissance aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In mid-June, a broad {{cyclonic}} area of <b>cloudiness</b> persisted to {{the south}} of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. A low-level circulation and banding features became more prominent on June16, and further development was aided by the presence of a tropical wave that first departed the western coastline of Africa on June5. As extremely deep convection festered within a band west of the disturbance's center, it is estimated the first tropical depression of the season formed around 06:00UTC on June18, located about 260mi (420km) southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. The newly-formed cyclone tracked west-northwest parallel to the coastline, steered by a strong area of high pressure to its north and east.|$|E
5|$|Winters are mild with {{frequent}} frosts and cold spells. Temperatures are usually mild {{during the day}} and cold during the night. Most precipitation results from frontal systems associated with cyclogenesis and sudestada, which bring long periods of precipitation, <b>cloudiness</b> and cooler temperatures, particularly in the southern and eastern parts. Dull, gray and damp weather characterize winters in the Pampas. Occasionally, tropical air masses from the north may move southward, providing relief from the cool, damp temperatures. Snowfall is extremely rare. When it does snow, it usually lasts for only a day or two.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa on August 6. It moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean without development, and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on August 16 after crossing Central America. <b>Cloudiness</b> and convection gradually increased along the wave axis and organized into a distinct area of disturbed weather on August 20 while located a short distance south of Manzanillo, Mexico. It slowly became better organized as it moved northwestward in an area favorable for continued development. With light vertical wind shear and warm water temperatures, the convection concentrated around a developing low-level circulation, and on August 22 it organized enough for the National Hurricane Center to classify it as Tropical Depression Nine-E while it was located about 115miles (185km) west of the Mexico mainland or about 220miles (345km) southeast of {{the southern tip of}} the Baja California Peninsula. With an anticyclone located over the southwestern United States and a ridge extending southward into northwestern Mexico, the National Hurricane Center initially predicted the depression to track generally west-northwestward out to sea and reach peak winds of 50mph (85km/h).|$|E
5|$|After being {{classified}} as a hurricane, Karl gradually strengthened, and its circulation became more distinguished from the surrounding <b>cloudiness.</b> A trough that emerged from North America steered the hurricane eastward, and on November 26, it reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 85mph (140km/h) and a central barometric pressure reading of 985 mbar (hPa; 29.09 inHg). Karl maintained this strength for approximately 18 hours until beginning to weaken slightly as it accelerated towards the northeast. On November 27, the storm's eye became more ragged as the cyclone passed within 230miles (370km) of the Azores and started {{to show signs of}} deterioration. The trough over the North Atlantic developed into the dominant low pressure area, and Karl turned northward around its periphery. It merged with another approaching system and was declared dissipated by November 28.|$|E
5|$|An area of <b>cloudiness</b> and rainshowers {{developed}} {{several hundred}} miles east-southeast of Bermuda on August 25, likely {{in association with}} a low-level disturbance that formed along a cold front. For several days, it moved southwestward, and, while located on the southwestern end of an upper-level trough {{to the north of}} Puerto Rico, deep convection throughout the system increased. The system tracked westward, and initially remained disorganized while surface pressures remained high. The system turned to a northwest drift, and began to slowly organize on August 30 while located a few hundred miles northeast of the Bahamas. A broad low-pressure area developed on August 31 though convection remained disorganized as winds of 20 to 25mph (32 to 40km/h) were reported in squalls. Conditions remained favorable for continued organization, and convection increased and persisted across the system. The system developed into Tropical Depression Five on September 1 after developing a low-level circulation while located about 140miles (225km) east of Daytona Beach, Florida.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Katrina was a late-forming {{tropical}} cyclone that impacted {{portions of the}} Greater Antilles and Bahamas in November1981. The twenty-first {{tropical cyclone}}, eleventh named storm, and seventh hurricane of the 1981 Atlantic hurricane season, Katrina developed from an area of <b>cloudiness</b> in the western Caribbean Sea early on November3. The initial tropical depression deepened slowly, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Katrina on November5. About six hours later, Katrina peaked with sustained winds of 85mph (140km/h). The storm made landfall along the south coast of Camagüey Province in Cuba early on November6. Katrina quickly weakened to a tropical storm, before emerging into the Atlantic Ocean hours later. The system then accelerated northeastward and crossed the Bahamas late on November6. Katrina dissipated late on November7, shortly before merging with a frontal system.|$|E
5|$|A {{cold front}} moved off the {{southeast}} {{coast of the}} United States on September 1. Gradually decaying, the front degenerated into an area of <b>cloudiness</b> and showers {{just east of the}} Georgia coast on September 2. Tracking eastward, a weak low-pressure area developed the next day. It slowly became better organized as its motion became erratic, and by late on September 4 the convection had become concentrated to the east of the center. On September 5, a Hurricane Hunters flight indicated the system had not acquired the characteristics of a tropical or subtropical cyclone. Interaction with an upper-level trough resulted in moderate wind shear which suppressed further development, and by September 6 the thunderstorm activity lost much organization. Upper-level winds became increasingly favorable, allowing the convection to concentrate about halfway between North Carolina and Bermuda. With a deep-layer ridge to its north, the system turned to a steady west-northwest track. A reconnaissance aircraft flight late on September 7 reported a very elongated center, with peak flight winds of 55mph (90km/h) about 100miles (160km) northeast of the center. Subsequent to the flight, the center became slightly better organized, and based on the large wind field and the presence of an upper-level low to its west-southwest, the National Hurricane Center classified the system as Subtropical Storm Gabrielle early on September 8 while located about 385miles (625km) southeast of Cape Lookout, North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the centre}} {{and the eastern}} {{parts of the country}} are mostly flat, the west is mountainous. Both the Andes and Sierras Pampeanas affect the climate of Argentina, leading to {{differences}} in temperature, pressure, and spatial distribution of precipitation depending on the topography and altitude. Here, the Andes exert an important influence on the climate. Owing to the higher altitudes of the Andes north of 40oS, they completely block the normal westerly flow, preventing low pressure systems containing moisture from the Pacific Ocean from coming in. Thus, much of Argentina north of 40oS is dominated by wind circulation patterns from the South Atlantic High. South of 40oS, the Andes are lower in altitude, allowing much of Patagonia to be dominated by westerly winds and air masses from the Pacific Ocean. However, the north–south orientation of the Andes creates a barrier for humid air masses originating from the Pacific Ocean. This is because they force these air masses upwards, cooling adiabactically. Most of the moisture is dropped on the Chilean side, causing abundant precipitation and <b>cloudiness</b> while on the Argentine side, the air warms adiabatically, causing it to become drier as it descends. Thus, an extensive rain–shadow is present in much of Patagonia, causing it to receive very little precipitation. The Sierras Pampeanas influences the climate on a much smaller scale than the Andes.|$|E
5|$|Similar to {{previous}} storms Antoinette and Bellamine, Tropical Storm Chantelle originated from the ITCZ in the Australian region. On November23, the MFR began tracking {{the system as}} a tropical disturbance off the west coast of Sumatra. The system fluctuated in intensity while moving westward, entering the south-west Indian as a tropical depression on November24. Around that time, the JTWC had begun classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 7S. On November26, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Chantelle, and the convection continued to organize despite the presence of wind shear. That day, the JTWC estimated peak 1minute winds of 120km/h (75mph). On November27, the MFR estimated peak 10minute winds of 95km/h (60mph). An approaching trough imparted significant weakening, and Chantelle weakened to tropical depression status 18hours after it was at peak intensity. A ridge behind the trough steered the weakening system to the northwest, causing Chantelle to reach the low latitude of 5°S. Widespread <b>cloudiness</b> made it difficult for MFR to continue tracking the circulation, and the agency issued the final advisory on November30 northwest of Diego Garcia. The JTWC continued tracking the storm for several more days, and the remnants of Chantelle likely contributed to the formation of the subsequent Tropical Cyclone Daniella.|$|E
5|$|Mireille was {{the strongest}} typhoon to hit Japan since Typhoon Nancy in 1961, causing heavy damage in 41 of 47 prefectures. It was the third storm to strike Japan in two weeks. Damage was {{heaviest}} on Kyushu where the storm made landfall. Because the storm moved northeastward through the Sea of Japan, the eastern quadrant of the storm crossed {{over much of the}} country, which is where the strongest winds in tropical cyclones are located. The high winds downed trees, damaged roofs, and left record power outages, affecting 7.36million people, or about 13% of total customers. In some areas, the power outages lasted as little as three minutes. The storm damaged over 670,000houses, of which 1,058were destroyed, and another 22,965were flooded. Power outages caused at least five factories to shut down production. Along the coast, the typhoon damaged 930ships, with dozens sunk or blown ashore. Most of the damage was related to agriculture or forests. Sea spray heavily damaged fruit trees and rice paddies. Crop damage amounted to $3billion, mostly to the apple industry, after 345,000tons of apples fell to the ground and another 43,000 were damaged on the trees. Most farms lost 80% of their crop, potentially taking 10years to regrow. Persistent <b>cloudiness</b> and rainfall following the storm diminished sunlight by 50%, furthering crop damage. There were 62deaths in Japan and 2,862injuries, including the deaths on the South Korean freighter, making it the deadliest typhoon there in 10years. About 80% of the deaths were male, and 70% were over 60years old. Most of the deaths were related to wind-blown debris, falling due to the wind, or being trapped or struck by fallen objects. The $6billion in insured losses and $10billion in overall damage made Mireille the costliest typhoon on record as of May 2014, according to Munich Re.|$|E
25|$|Tapirs have brown eyes, {{often with}} a bluish cast to them, which has been {{identified}} as corneal <b>cloudiness,</b> a condition most commonly found in Malayan tapirs. The exact etiology is unknown, but the <b>cloudiness</b> may be caused by excessive exposure to light or by trauma. However, the tapir's sensitive ears and strong sense of smell help to compensate for deficiencies in vision.|$|E
25|$|Malayan tapirs {{have very}} poor eyesight, making them rely greatly on their {{excellent}} {{sense of smell}} and hearing to go about in their everyday lives. They have small, beady eyes with brown irises {{on either side of}} their faces. Their eyes are often covered in a blue haze, which is corneal <b>cloudiness</b> thought to be caused by repetitive exposure to light. Corneal <b>cloudiness</b> is when the cornea starts to lose its transparency. The cornea is necessary for the transmitting and focusing of outside light as it enters the eye, and <b>cloudiness</b> can cause vision loss. This causes the Malayan tapir to have very inadequate vision, both on land and in water, where they spend the majority of their time. Also, as these tapirs are most active at night and since they have poor eyesight, it is harder for them to search for food and avoid predators in the dark.|$|E
25|$|It is {{less clear}} how <b>cloudiness</b> would respond to a warming climate; {{depending}} {{on the nature of}} the response, clouds could either further amplify or partly mitigate warming from long-lived greenhouse gases.|$|E
25|$|Neuberger {{analysed}} 12,000 paintings, held in American and European {{museums and}} dated between 1400 and 1967, for <b>cloudiness</b> and darkness. His 1970 publication shows {{an increase in}} such depictions that corresponds to the Little Ice Age, peaking between 1600 and 1649.|$|E
25|$|Oxygen-depleting {{substances}} may {{be natural}} {{materials such as}} plant matter (e.g. leaves and grass) as well as man-made chemicals. Other natural and anthropogenic substances may cause turbidity (<b>cloudiness)</b> which blocks light and disrupts plant growth, and clogs the gills of some fish species.|$|E
25|$|As {{a complex}} {{chemical}} mixture {{dependent on the}} activity of microorganisms, wine can be unstable and reactive to changes in its environment. Once bottled, a wine may be exposed to extremes of temperature and humidity, as well as violent movement during transportation and storage. These may cause <b>cloudiness,</b> sedimentation and/or the formation of tartrate crystals; more seriously, they may also cause spoilage or the production of carbonic gas.|$|E
25|$|Egyptians {{reportedly}} {{used the}} coagulant alum {{as early as}} 1500 BC to reduce the visible <b>cloudiness</b> (turbidity) in the water. Alum was imported into England mainly from the Middle East, and, from the late 15th century onwards, the Papal States for hundreds of years. Its use there was as a dye-fixer (mordant) for wool (which was one of England's primary industries, the value of which increased significantly if dyed). These sources were unreliable, however, {{and there was a}} push to develop a source in England especially as imports from the Papal States were ceased following the excommunication of Henry VIII.|$|E
25|$|Relative {{humidity}} {{is always}} very high, {{particularly in the}} mornings. High humidity produces brief morning fog in the early summer and a usually persistent low cloud deck during the winter (generally developing in May and persisting into late November or even early December). The predominantly onshore flow makes the Lima area one of the cloudiest among the entire Peruvian coast. Lima has only 1284 hours of sunshine a year, 28.6 hours in July and 184 hours in April, which is exceptionally little for the latitude. Winter <b>cloudiness</b> prompts locals to seek for sunshine in Andean valleys located at elevations generally above 500 meters above sea level.|$|E
25|$|October is the {{transition}} month between the summer rainy {{season and the}} cold, dry winter. The predominantly tropical cloudy weather of the summer is replaced by cooler, drier, and less cloudy conditions. The primary weather producers during October are cold frontal systems from the Asian mainland. On the average, one frontal passage per week can be expected during the month. A typical frontal passage is proceeded by increasing middle and high <b>cloudiness</b> with light rain. Following the frontal passage, mostly clear skies can be expected for 3 or 4 days. During this clear period {{it is very likely}} for fog to form. Fog is especially prevalent in river valleys and in low-lying areas.|$|E
25|$|The main forces {{influencing}} the climate are the glaciation and sea ice. At 81° north the archipelago experiences 141 annual days of midnight sun, from 12 April to 30 August. During the winter it experiences 128 days of polar night from 19 October to 23 February. Even during summer {{the angle of}} the sun ray spreads the limited radiated energy over a large area. Further cooling is caused by the high amount of <b>cloudiness.</b> The sea starts to freeze in late September and reaches its annual maximum in March, at which time ninety-five percent of the sea is ice-covered. The ice starts to decrease in May and suffers a major melting in June, with the minimum occurring in August or early September.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the impacts}} of deep sea mining, {{sediment}} plumes could have the greatest impact. Plumes are caused when the tailings from mining (usually fine particles) are dumped back into the ocean, creating a cloud of particles floating in the water. Two types of plumes occur: near-bottom plumes and surface plumes. Near-bottom plumes occur when the tailings are pumped {{back down to the}} mining site. The floating particles increase the turbidity, or <b>cloudiness,</b> of the water, clogging filter-feeding apparatuses used by benthic organisms. Surface plumes cause a more serious problem. Depending {{on the size of the}} particles and water currents the plumes could spread over vast areas. The plumes could impact zooplankton and light penetration, in turn affecting the food web of the area.|$|E
25|$|The city {{experiences}} a southwest monsoon-influenced Subtropical highland climate (Cwb) of a warm, temperate climate. The southwest monsoon rainfall occurs during mid-June to September. Lightning and thunder often precedes rainfall {{in the region}} with cumulonimbus clouds and light showers dominating the weather. Continuous rainfall for several days occurs resulting in landslides and blockage of roads. Streams and rivers swell up carrying huge amounts of debris from forests. Deep puddles, thick mud, and landslides along roads form barriers to transportation. Cold winds, low temperatures at night, and moderate temperatures during the day, <b>cloudiness,</b> light showers and snowfall mark winter weather in this zone. Fog causes poor visibility, which {{poses a threat to}} vehicular traffic in the city. As spring approaches, the landscape is marked by violent winds and relatively dry and clear skies.|$|E
25|$|The {{winter in}} Seoul is {{controlled}} by the large Siberian high pressure system (the Asiatic high), which results in predominantly cold, dry north-westerly winds. The influence of the Siberian high leads to significantly colder winter temperatures than would be expected at this latitude. About every 4 to 6 days a low-pressure trough will move through South Korea, bringing with it <b>cloudiness</b> and light precipitation. The amount of precipitation locally depends mostly on the elevation of the station and the length of time that the air has been over the Yellow Sea. Maximum snowfall occurs over the northwest coast, which is the most exposed to the northwesterly flow, and in the mountain areas. Normally less than 10 percent of the annual precipitation falls during the winter. Frequently the weather is cloudless, clear, and dry, except for the southwestern region of the peninsula. The mean January temperature in Seoul is -2.4°C (27°F). January, is the coldest month in Seoul.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} {{disinfection}} {{in the treatment}} of waste water is to substantially reduce the number of microorganisms in the water to be discharged back into the environment for the later use of drinking, bathing, irrigation, etc. The effectiveness of disinfection depends {{on the quality of the}} water being treated (e.g., <b>cloudiness,</b> pH, etc.), the type of disinfection being used, the disinfectant dosage (concentration and time), and other environmental variables. Cloudy water will be treated less successfully, since solid matter can shield organisms, especially from ultraviolet light or if contact times are low. Generally, short contact times, low doses and high flows all militate against effective disinfection. Common methods of disinfection include ozone, chlorine, ultraviolet light, or sodium hypochlorite. Chloramine, which is used for drinking water, is not used {{in the treatment of}} waste water because of its persistence. After multiple steps of disinfection, the treated water is ready to be released back into the water cycle by means of the nearest body of water or agriculture. Afterwards, the water can be transferred to reserves for everyday human uses.|$|E
25|$|The surface {{reflectance}} {{of incoming}} solar radiation {{is important for}} the surface energy balance (SEB). It is the ratio of reflected to incident solar radiation, commonly referred to as albedo. Climatologists are primarily interested in albedo integrated over the shortwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum (~300 to 3500nm), which coincides with the main solar energy input. Typically, albedo values for non-melting snow-covered surfaces are high (~80-90%) except in the case of forests. The higher albedos for snow and ice cause rapid shifts in surface reflectivity in autumn and spring in high latitudes, but the overall climatic significance of this increase is spatially and temporally modulated by cloud cover. (Planetary albedo is determined principally by cloud cover, and by the small amount of total solar radiation received in high latitudes during winter months.) Summer and autumn are times of high-average <b>cloudiness</b> over the Arctic Ocean so the albedo feedback associated with the large seasonal changes in sea-ice extent is greatly reduced. Groisman et al. (1994a) observed that snow cover exhibited the greatest influence on the Earth radiative balance in the spring (April to May) period when incoming solar radiation was greatest over snow-covered areas.|$|E
500|$|Cold fronts may feature narrow {{bands of}} {{thunderstorms}} and severe weather, and may on occasion be preceded by squall lines or dry lines. Warm fronts are usually preceded by stratiform precipitation and fog. The weather usually clears quickly after a front's passage. Some fronts produce no precipitation and little <b>cloudiness,</b> {{although there is}} invariably a wind shift.|$|E
500|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} with maximum sustained winds between [...] and [...] {{can have}} their center of circulations obscured by <b>cloudiness</b> within visible and infrared satellite imagery, which makes diagnosis of their intensity a challenge. [...] Winds within tropical cyclones can also be estimated by tracking features within the CDO using rapid scan geostationary satellite imagery, whose pictures are taken minutes apart rather than every half-hour.|$|E
