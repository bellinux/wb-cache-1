The CIRSE registry of <b>closure</b> <b>devices</b> with an anchor and a plug started in January 2009 and ended in August 2009. A total of 1, 107 patients were included in the registry.

There was no difference in deployment failure related to local PVD at the access site. Calcification was a reason for deployment failure in only 5. 9 cm, and two vessel occlusions. The conclusion of this registry of <b>closure</b> <b>devices</b> with an anchor and a plug is that the use of this device in interventional radiology procedures is safe, with a low incidence of serious access site complications.

Recent data, however, suggest that VCD are improving, complication rates associated with their use may be decreasing, and their utilization may improve the process of care after femoral artery access. Challenges in the second decade of VCD experience will include performing definitive randomized trials, evaluating outcomes in higher-risk patients, and developing more ideal <b>closure</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{report the}} outcome of a {{prospective}} randomized safety and performance trial of 2 access site <b>closure</b> <b>devices</b> versus a wound dressing. METHODS: Between October 2005 and July 2006, 852 consecutive patients (605 men; mean age 67 years) undergoing diagnostic or interventional catheterization procedures thru a 5 - or 6 -F femoral sheath were randomized to one of the 3 closure methods: a collagen plug device (Angio-Seal), a clip (StarClose), or a wound dressing (D-Stat Dry). The efficacy of the devices was assessed, as well as the complications occurring at the puncture site during the hospital stay. The primary endpoint of the study was the cumulative incidence of access site pseudoaneurysm, major access site bleeding requiring transfusion, access site vascular surgery, or death from all causes. RESULTS: There {{were no significant differences in}} baseline characteristics between the 3 treatment groups. The primary endpoint was reached in 20 (7. 1 %) of 281 patients treated with D-Stat Dry and in 11 (1. 9 %) of 571 patients treated with the mechanical <b>closure</b> <b>devices</b> (p> 0. 0001). There was no significant difference among the mechanical <b>closure</b> <b>devices</b> concerning the incidence of the primary endpoint (Angio-Seal 1. 1 % versus StarClose 2. 8 %; p = 0. 13). CONCLUSION: The collagen plug device had the lowest rates of major and minor access site-related complications after removal of 5 - or 6 -F femoral sheaths. The difference between the mechanical <b>closure</b> <b>devices</b> concerning the incidence of the primary endpoint did not reach statistical significance.

40|$|Background: We {{evaluated}} {{the long term}} clinical outcomes of femoral vascular <b>closure</b> <b>devices</b> following its deployment in coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures. Methods: From June 2000 to September 2004, 265 patients who received femoral vascular <b>closure</b> <b>devices</b> after coronary angiography and PCIs were enrolled into the study. Patients' medical records were reviewed and vascular complications within 1 year of follow-up period were recorded. Rutherford's categories of claudication were used to quantify different degrees of claudication and leg ischaemia. Duplex ultrasonography of both femoral arteries (using the nonaccessed site as control) was performed at 1 year after deployment of vascular <b>closure</b> <b>devices.</b> Vessel diameter and flow velocities for both common femoral arteries were obtained. Results: There was no occurrence of late vascular complications like arteriovenous fistula, pseudoaneurysm, surgical repair of access site complications, late groin bleeding and infection. By Rutherford categories of claudication, 99. 2 % of patients had grade 0 claudication while the remaining 0. 8 % was in grade 1. By arterial Duplex ultrasonography, the peak systolic velocity of the accessed femoral artery (predominantly right side) was nonsignificantly higher, 94. 9 ± 26. 0 cm/s when compared to 91. 5 ± 24. 8 cm/s in the control site (P = 0. 12). As for vessel diameter, no {{significant difference was found}} in the mean end-diastolic vessel diameter 8. 8 6 1. 3 mm (puncture site) versus 8. 7 ± 4. 4 mm (control site) (P = 0. 72).

All patients should remain on blood thinner medication for at least 6 months and up to a year unless the patient had a stoke in which they would always be on blood thinners. Patients with coronary artery disease or pulmonary hypertension will take additional medicines described by their physician. For patients who had heart surgery to repair the defect or received a transcatheter <b>closure</b> <b>device,</b> they will need to take some form of antibiotics to prevent infections such as endocarditis for at least 6 months following the procedure.|$|E
5000|$|In 2000, Wilmshurst {{published}} a paper linking migraine to patent foramen ovale, a common cardiac condition affecting {{up to one}} in four people. This led NMT Medical to develop a PFO <b>closure</b> <b>device</b> branded STARflex. Wilmshurst was recruited {{as part of the}} [...] "Migraine Intervention with STARflex Technology" [...] (MIST) trial. The number of patients and potential value of the market (estimated in excess of $15bn) drove NMT's stock price to $25/share. A substantial discrepancy emerged between echocardiogram result interpretations of the implanting cardiologists and Wilmshurst's review. Wilmshurst reported a significantly higher proportion (one in three versus four in sixty-five) with residual cardiac shunts. An independent review backed Wilmshurst's figures. Less than a fortnight after returning from a conference in Washington where he discussed his results, Wilmshurst was contacted by lawyers for NMT making accusations of [...] "seriously defamatory allegations". The first NMT libel suit was lodged in 2007, and drew media attention. NMT served four separate writs on Wilmshurst. The courts demanded that they lodge £200,000 due to their parlous financial state and the likelihood of failing in the action. NMT declared bankruptcy after pursuing Wilmshurst for over three years.|$|E
