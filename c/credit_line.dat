I show that when information is perfect, <b>credit</b> <b>lines</b> can reduce contagion because lenders are able to disconnect from distressed borrowers.

Using data for 939 {{publicly}} listed firms from 17 European countries {{over the period}} from 2004 to 2013, we investigate the effect of used <b>credit</b> <b>lines</b> on R & D investments, controlling for other determinants of R & D investments, i. e., cash flows, cash holdings, sales growth, equity financing, and Tobin's Q. Our estimation results, based on the system-GMM method, show that used <b>credit</b> <b>lines</b> have a positive and significant impact on R & D investments. In addition, we find that this impact is more pronounced for small and young firms than for large and mature firms. These results show that firms use <b>credit</b> <b>lines</b> {{as part of their}} liquidity management tools for supporting their R & D investments. Finally, we provide evidence that European firms in bank-based countries increased their use of <b>credit</b> <b>lines</b> for financing their R & D investments during the financial crisis of 2007 – 2009, while the link between R & D investments and used <b>credit</b> <b>lines</b> became weaker during the European sovereign debt crisis of 2010 – 2013...|$|R

Firms with prior defaults access their <b>credit</b> <b>lines</b> less, suggesting that bank monitoring influences firms' usage decisions. Line usage has an aging effect that causes it to decrease by roughly 10 % per year of its life.

25|$|Trump's {{first big}} deal in Manhattan was the {{development}} of the Grand Hyatt Hotel in 1978 next to Grand Central Terminal. The aging brick facade of the Commodore Hotel was sheathed in glass, and the existing lobby of the hotel was replaced by an atrium. The Commodore was thus presented as a remodeled Hyatt hotel at its opening in September 1980, helping to bring Trump to public prominence. Part of this deal was a $1million loan Fred Trump's Village Construction Corp. made to help repay draws on a Chase Manhattan <b>credit</b> <b>line</b> Fred had arranged for Donald as he built the hotel, as well as a $70million construction loan jointly guaranteed by Fred and the Hyatt hotel chain. Fred was a silent partner in the initiative, due to his reputation having been damaged in New York real estate circles, after investigations into windfall profits and other abuses in his real estate projects, making Donald the front man in the deal. According to journalist Wayne Barrett, Fred's two-decade friendship with a top Equitable officer, Ben Holloway, helped convince them to agree to the project. Donald negotiated a 40-year tax abatement for the hotel with the city, in exchange for a share of the venture's profits. The deal helped reduce the risk of the project and provided an incentive for investors to participate.|$|E
25|$|On February 27, 2009, Citigroup {{announced}} that the U.S. government would take a 36% equity {{stake in the company}} by converting US$25 billion in emergency aid into common stock with a United States Treasury <b>credit</b> <b>line</b> of $45 billion to prevent the bankruptcy of the company. The government guaranteed losses on more than $300 billion of troubled assets and injected $20 billion immediately into the company. The salary of the CEO was set at $1 per year and the highest salary of employees was restricted to $500,000. Any compensation amount above $500,000 had to be paid with restricted stock that could not be sold by the employee until the emergency government aid was repaid in full. The U.S. government also gained control of half the seats in the Board of Directors, and the senior management was subjected to removal by the US government if there were poor performance. By December 2009, the U.S. government stake was reduced from a 36% stake to a 27% stake, after Citigroup sold $21 billion of common shares and equity in the largest single share sale in U.S. history, surpassing Bank of America's $19 billion share sale 1 month prior. By December 2010, Citigroup repaid the emergency aid in full and the U.S. government had made a $12 billion profit on its investment in the company. Government restrictions on pay and oversight of the senior management were removed after the U.S. government sold its remaining 27% stake in December 2010.|$|E

40|$|The current {{financial}} crisis {{has given rise}} to a new type of bank run, one that affects both the banks' assets and liabilities. In this paper we combine information from the commercial paper market with loan level data from the Survey of Terms of Business Loans to show that during the 2007 - 2008 financial crises banks suffered a run on <b>credit</b> <b>lines.</b> First, as in previous crises, we find an increase in the usage of <b>credit</b> <b>lines</b> as commercial spreads widen, especially among the lowest quality firms. Second, as the crises deepened, firms drew down their <b>credit</b> <b>lines</b> out of fear that the weakened health of their financial institution might affect the availability of the funds going forward. In particular, we show that these precautionary draw-downs are strongly correlated with the perceived default risk of their bank. Finally, we conclude that these runs on <b>credit</b> <b>lines</b> have weakened banks further, curtailing their ability to effectively fulfill their role as financial intermediaries.
