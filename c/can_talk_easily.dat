40|$|Now {{days the}} role of the {{consumer}} in the economy is taken very seriously and, in some cases, we <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> <b>talk</b> about the consumer’s “supremacy”. All the efforts of the companies are concentrated on the consumers and finding the best way to attract them, but gaining their trust and building a longterm relationship is even more difficult now due to a very intense competition on all the markets. Client service can always help a company to differentiate itself from the others, this including the management of customer complaints. The subject is still very sensible because many consumers are not aware of the complaining system or are shy in displaying this kind of behaviour, so companies can develop strategies to educate and council clients regarding the complaining process, managing in this way to gain trust and also to increase profitability. Behaviour, complaints, consumer, satisfaction, politeness, service quality...|$|R
40|$|Altmann (1968) {{presented}} {{a list of}} what they found to be the distinctive characteristics which, collectively, define {{what it is to be}} a human language. Among the characteristics is the phenomenon of "aboutness", that is, in using a human language we talk about things that are external to ourselves. This not only includes things that we find in our immediate environment, but also things that are displaced in time and space. For example, at this moment I <b>can</b> just as <b>easily</b> <b>talk</b> about Tahiti or the planet Pluto, neither of which are in my immediate environment nor ever have been, as I can about this telephone before me or the computer I am using at this moment. Temporal displacement is similar: it would seem I <b>can</b> as <b>easily</b> <b>talk</b> about Abraham Lincoln or Julius Caesar, neither a contemporary of mine, as I can of former president Bill Clinton, or my good friend John, who are contemporaries of mine. This notion of aboutness is, intuitively, lacking in some contrasting instances. For example, it is easy to think that animal communication systems lack thi...|$|R

They added in that bit about how she has this technique. They're quite frightening, state troopers. I don't think you <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> <b>talk</b> your way out of anything with them. She has this trick where she has a veteran's ring ... which is actually a really terrible thing to do. She has the notion that, if it will help her out, she will go to extremes. At the same time, you don't feel judgment for her, and she doesn't do it out of any disrespect." [...] Negga concluded that, [...] "... I think that she’s really good at getting herself out of sticky situations, mainly because she’s really good at getting herself into sticky situations. There’s something about her. Even though she’s quite irreverent and loud, you can’t help but have affection for her.|$|R

[...] "From the {{day that}} you {{captured}} me I {{made up my mind}} that I would escape sooner or later, whatever the risk; but I knew well that I could never traverse the country until I could speak the language like a native. I have made great progress, and can now understand all that is said and <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> freely and <b>easily,</b> but not so that I could travel alone as a native. It will be months yet before I can do that. Nor, after the kindness with which you have treated me, would I leave you suddenly without warning. When I feel that I can safely travel alone I shall give you fair warning. I shall say to you, Sheik, if you will now travel with me to Suakim or some other port where I can obtain money for paying you a fair ransom I will remain with you until such ransom is paid into your hands; if you will not do so I shall consider myself free to escape when I can. Of course it will be open to you to treat me again as a slave, and to use all vigilance to prevent my leaving you, but I shall consider that by giving you fair warning I shall be free to use my best endeavours to get away." ...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} this symposium, 2 ̆ 2 law and {{cultural}} conflict, 2 ̆ 2 is wide-ranging and various. Even if we sharply narrow our focus to the judicial institutions by which the state declares and enforces its official vision of social order, 2 ̆ 2 law 2 ̆ 2 is multifarious in its purposes and functions. 2 ̆ 2 Cultural conflicts 2 ̆ 2 also come in radically diverse forms. Taken together, the permutations are staggering in their array and complexity. It {{is not surprising that}} debates about 2 ̆ 2 law and cultural conflict 2 ̆ 2 sometimes lose traction, because participants <b>can</b> so <b>easily</b> <b>talk</b> past each other by emphasizing different aspects of the larger subject. The most useful contribution I can make as an introductory speaker, therefore, is to chart the overall contours of the topic which this conference seeks to address. My effort shall be to sketch an analytic framework that is sufficiently general to mediate usefully among the widely disparate views that participants in this conference will no doubt bring to bear on its three major topics: family, expression, and religion...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of parents}} is crucial {{when it comes}} to the sexual {{development}} of youth. The present cross-sectional study examined the relationships between parent-adolescent communication, parental monitoring and the sexual risk behavior of adolescents, and tested whether these relations were moderated by gender and education level. While most studies of parental communication have focused on communication in general, this study specifically focused on the quality of communication. Data from the large-scale study HBSC (Health Behaviour in School-aged Children) was used. Participants were 5, 719 Dutch secondary school students, aged 12 to 18 (M = 15. 05) and lived in intact or single-parent families. Results of a hierarchical binary logistic regression analysis indicated that stronger parental monitoring was related to less sexual risk behavior whereas the quality of parent-adolescent communication was not, while both controlled for family situation and age. No interaction effects were found. These findings indicate that adolescents who feel they <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> <b>talk</b> to their parents do not display less sexual risk behavior. Instead, parental monitoring shows to be a crucial factor in preventing children from behaving in sexually risky ways. Implications of these specific characteristics for adolescents’ sexual development are discussed. Further research is needed to identify the topics parents use to communicate with their children on subjects concerning sexual development and behavior...|$|R
