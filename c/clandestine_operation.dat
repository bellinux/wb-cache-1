2500|$|The boat's repairs {{took longer}} than {{expected}} {{and instead of}} being completed by 4 April, {{it was not until}} the 10th that the boat was ready to depart on its third patrol. Nevertheless, when she left, she did so with repairs incomplete and a number of dock workers remained on board to finish these off while at sea. Departing Lorient with an armed escort known as a Sperrbrecher and three anti-submarine vessels, U-175 proceeded independently after passing Ile de Groix. In the days that followed, a number of radar contacts sent the boat below the surface. However, by 15 April they had arrived in the Mid-Atlantic air gap where they were out of range of Allied aircraft, allowing them to operate on the surface with less circumspection. The following day, BdU ordered U-175 to join an attack on convoy HX-233, a Liverpool-bound convoy which had departed Halifax and New York City earlier in the month, which had been spotted by [...] while on a <b>clandestine</b> <b>operation</b> to pick up German prisoners-of-war.

2500|$|In April 1961 Stevenson {{suffered}} the greatest humiliation of his diplomatic {{career in the}} Bay of Pigs invasion. After hearing rumors that [...] "a lot of refugees {{wanted to go back}} and overthrow Castro", Stevenson voiced his skepticism about an invasion, but [...] "he was kept on the fringes of the operation, receiving...nine days before the invasion, only an unduly vague briefing by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr." [...] and the CIA. [...] Senior CIA official Tracy Barnes told Stevenson and his staff that [...] "there {{was going to be a}} <b>clandestine</b> <b>operation</b> in Cuba...it was strictly a Cuban affair. It would have some American cooperation, but only with the training and financing." [...] According to historian Peter Wyden, Barnes did not tell Stevenson that there would be a large-scale invasion of Cuba, nor did he provide details about the full extent of American support for, and involvement with, the Cuban rebels, nor did he tell Stevenson about the planned air strikes to destroy Castro's air force. Assistant Secretary of State Harlan Cleveland, who attended the briefing, felt that Barnes was [...] "too evasive", that he had been sent to reassure Stevenson that Kennedy [...] "knew what he was doing", and that [...] "evidently Stevenson was not to be told" [...] the full details of the invasion plan. Historian Garry Wills has written that [...] "news of the invasion was leaking out...Castro knew the landings would occur; only Adlai Stevenson was kept in the dark" [...] about the invasion by President Kennedy and his aides. Kennedy, anticipating that Stevenson might be angered at being left out of the discussions over whether to invade Cuba, told Schlesinger that [...] "the integrity and credibility of Adlai Stevenson constitute one of our great national assets. I don't want to do anything to jeopardize that", and he asked Schlesinger to let Stevenson know that the president was shielding him from many of the details to protect him in case the <b>clandestine</b> <b>operation</b> failed. Instead, as Robert Dallek has written, [...] "by leaving him out of the discussion it led to his humiliation." [...] Unaware that the anti-Castro Cuban exiles landing at the Bay of Pigs were being armed and assisted directly by the CIA and US Navy, and that American pilots were participating in bombing raids of Cuban targets, Stevenson unwittingly [...] "repeated a CIA cover story in a speech before the UN General Assembly." [...] He argued that the rebels were not assisted in any way by the U.S. government; when this claim was proven to be false Stevenson complained that [...] "I took this job on the understanding that I would be consulted and kept fully informed on everything. Now my credibility has been compromised and therefore my usefulness." [...] When he told his friend Harlan Cleveland that his own government had [...] "deliberately tricked" [...] him into believing there was no direct American involvement in the invasion, Cleveland replied [...] "I feel as betrayed as you do." [...] Stevenson seriously considered resigning, but was convinced by his friends and President Kennedy to stay.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the context}} of tradecraft, covert and clandestine are not synonymous. As noted in the {{definition}} (which {{has been used by}} NATO since World War II) in a covert operation the identity of the sponsor is concealed, but in a <b>clandestine</b> <b>operation,</b> the operation itself is concealed. At least insofar as someone or something that is known to exist by at least two individuals can be [...] "concealed". Put differently, clandestine means [...] "hidden", and covert means [...] "deniable". The adversary is aware that a covert activity is happening, but theoretically and hypothetically does not know who is doing it and certainly not the sponsorship. Separating action from [...] "sponsorship" [...] is a technicality hopefully (for the [...] "sponsor") providing sufficient distance from the action so that the sponsor can claim ignorance in the event the [...] "covert" [...] plot is discovered. Clandestine activities, however, if successful, are completely unknown to the adversary, and their function, such as espionage, would be neutralized if there was any awareness of the activity. Such [...] "neutralization" [...] of the intended goal, actions or results does not grant the sponsor deniability of responsibility, blame and guilt and is not a legal, ethical or moral defense if negative consequences have resulted from the operation. Espionage is espionage {{regardless of whether or not}} the intelligence and information provided to the sponsor – friend or foe – is of benefit or use or not. Even if the information was intentionally misleading, fake or inaccurate the crime is in passing it to a foreign government.|$|E
