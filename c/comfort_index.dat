40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} the experimentation on environmental high performance urban paving for open space re- design in Urban Barriera program framework in Turin (Italy). Urban Barriera is a program designed to trigger a process of improvement of the “Barriera di Milano” area, the historical neighborhood in the northern part of the city. It was supported by the City of Turin, the Piedmont Region and the European Community, in order to operate on physical, economic, social aspects of the city by encouraging collaboration and proactive interaction between all actors and beneficiaries of urban redevelopment. Particular attention is given to the issue of re-design of urban open spaces, as an instrument for regeneration of the district also from the social point of view. The phase of competitive tender was preceded by a research on environmental high performance paving characterized by good properties related to solar absorption/reflection and permeability, selecting one of this materials for the redevelopment of public open space. In this work, the microclimate conditions of three urban areas were compared, with similar characteristics of morphological urban shape of buildings’ surround but different paving materials. The experimentation started with microclimate monitoring to evaluate outdoor thermal comfort; interviews on citizens and the calculation of thermal <b>comfort</b> <b>indexes</b> completed the analysis. Some of the thermal <b>comfort</b> <b>indexes</b> used are intended for outdoors spaces, but others were developed starting from indoor indexes. A first investigation on the correlation between outdoor thermal <b>comfort</b> <b>indexes</b> and subjective thermal perception have been conducted.

Considering climatic conditions and characteristics, examining {{the effect of these}} elements on architecture and its interactive relationship with buildings are inevitable. This study examined the thermal <b>comfort</b> <b>indices</b> and corresponding climatic factors in Babolsar. In order to determine the comfort conditions in buildings of Babolsar, this research has been conducted based on bioclimatic indices and aims to use environmental potentials in order to save energy and improve comfort in the built environments. Accordingly, the required climate data over a 60 -year period (1951 - 2010) were collected according to the climate center of Babolsar and Meteorological Organization website of Iran.

40|$|Vehicle {{vibration}} mostly originates {{from the}} road excitation and causes discomfort, fatigue and even injury to a driver. Vehicle ride comfort {{is one of the}} most important performance indices to achieve a high-quality vehicle design. Since design parameter tolerances inevitably result in the vehicle ride comfort variance, the variance characteristics should be analyzed in the early design stage of the vehicle. The vehicle ride comfort is often defined by an index whichemploys a weighted RMS value of the acceleration PSD of a seat position. The design solution is obtained through two steps in this study. An optimization problem to obtain a minimum ride <b>comfort</b> <b>index</b> is solved first.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{investigate}} driver seat comfort and discuss some of the subjective and objective factors that impact it. Comfort describes {{the nature of the}} interaction between a human being and a specific environment and is characterized as a feeling of pleasure and satisfaction or discontent and pain. Driver seat design for comfort is complex and challenging because it is somewhat subjective in nature (e. g. mood, culture & car brand). However, there are certain aspects of a seat comfort, which are objective (e. g. anthropometrics, pressure distribution on seat) and can be modeled mathematically. This paper discuses some of the objective and subjective measures which influence seat comfort. In addition, it provides a mathematical model of seat <b>comfort</b> <b>index</b> based on neural networks in terms of some of the objective measures, which influence it. The results of this work show that the objective measures included lead to a correlation of 0. 794 to the overall <b>comfort</b> <b>index</b> identified by twelve drivers testing five different types of seats. This implies that our selected objective measures/inputs can capture about 80 % of the <b>comfort</b> <b>index</b> identified by test drivers. The remaining 20 % variation in <b>comfort</b> <b>index</b> not captured by the model utilized in this work can be attributed to subjective measures and/o...|$|E

Cities like Melbourne, Australia have experienced urban revitalisation through the transformation of its street precincts, laneways, arcades, promenades and micro open spaces. A feature {{in the design of}} these urban outdoor spaces is microclimate. The evaluation of urban microclimates by means of comfort sensation and physiological temperature generally quantify the effects of urban environments with the use of thermal environmental indices. However, these outdoor <b>comfort</b> <b>indices</b> are underpinned by steady state models primarily developed for indoor applications and have been modified for outdoor use to account for outdoor effects such as solar radiation. This paper is a proof of concept study via continuous monitoring of microclimate conditions and usage patterns of an urban outdoor space located at an inner city university campus. Preliminary analysis of results of the pilot study show observations of the usage patterns of the university outdoor space pointing to a pronounced relationship between the thermal sense of people using the space and the environmental elements of thermal radiation, convection, and contact thermal conductivity not considered by the widely used outdoor thermal <b>comfort</b> <b>indices...</b>|$|R
40|$|Acoustic Comfort and Acoustic Silence are {{determinants}} of tranquility in a worship space. The results presented here {{are part of}} a study that investigates the behaviour of acoustically constituted worship parameters in six Catholic churches (Goa, India). Acoustic comfort is quantified through an Acoustic <b>Comfort</b> Impression <b>Index</b> which measures the net comfort induced through the optimization of the desired subjective acoustic impressions for different types of music and different music sources. Silence Factor is constituted through the normalization of equivalent noise level (LAeq) and the subjective acoustic impressions of background noise and echoes. Regression analyses of the derived acoustic parameters generate significant results. Acoustically, the Silence Factor quadratically decays with LAeq and the Acoustic <b>Comfort</b> Impression <b>Index</b> is predicted as a multiregression on the subjective acoustic impressions of balance and clarity. Architecturally, the Silence Factor linearly grows with the width of the nave (of the church) whereas, the Acoustic <b>Comfort</b> Impression <b>Index</b> does not significantly relate with any of the tested architectural parameters. Silence Factor was found to linearly grow with Acoustic <b>Comfort</b> Impression <b>Index</b> in a church. The predictability of acoustic comfort and acoustic silence from acoustic and architectural measures can be developed into a design tool for the prediction of a tranquility factor in worship spaces. ...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{comfort in}} hot and arid outdoor environments is an {{industrial}} challenging field. An outdoor air-conditioned area {{was designed and}} built to host sport and social events during summers 2014 and 2015 in Qatar. This article presents a thermal comfort analysis of the outdoor air-conditioned area using computational fluid dynamics, on-site spectators surveys, and on-spot climatic measurements. The study utilized computational fluid dynamics to develop a thermal comfort model of the outdoor air-conditioned area to predict the thermal comfort of the occupants. Five different thermal comfort indices; mean comfort vote, cooling power index, wet-bulb globe temperature index, Humidex, discomfort index, were utilized to assess the thermal comfort of spectators within the conditioned space. The indices utilized different on site measurements of meteorological data and on-site interviews.
