In 1994 Business interests within the Group were demarcated. The eldest son, Mr. L N Mittal continued managing the international operations while Mr. Pramod Mittal and Mr. Vinod Mittal, the younger brothers focused on steel and other businesses in India. In 1994, it commissioned the world's largest gas-based single mega module plant for manufacturing direct reduced iron (sponge iron), at its Maharashtra-based Dolvi plant. In 1995 hot strip mill with Continuous Strip Processing (CSP) technology was installed at Dolvi. In 1998, integrated steel plant for the production of hot rolled coils was launched, using technologies such as the Conarc Process for steel making and the Compact Strip Process. Year 2000 saw the erection and commissioning of a 2 MTPA blast furnace at the Dolvi steel complex. Sponge iron capacity was increased from 1.2 MTPA to 1.4 MTPA in the year 2003. Year 2004 saw the increase in capacity of Hot rolled coil from 1.5 MTPA to 2.4 MTPA and Sponge iron from 1.4 MTPA to 1.6 MTPA.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIncreasing the {{productivity}} of rolling mills requires improving surface properties of roll surface and prolonging roll life. The properties of interest are anti-adhesion to avoid catastrophic adhesive transfer, and wear resistance. Hard Cr coatings provides such properties for Al and <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> rolling, but should be replaced {{in the long run}} due to health/environmental issues. Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) and Plasma-Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) of ceramic coatings are promising substitutes. In the context of high <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> rolling, TiN, TiBN, and CrN are tested here in terms of adhesive properties under large sliding conditions (plate-on-ring test) at increasing load. They are compared with a naked High Speed Steel (HSS) surface and a hard chromium coating. A 3 -stage evolution is found as load increases, the last stage being characterized by massive adhesive transfer (severe wear) and high, irregular friction. TiN is shown to perform poorly under these conditions and does not bring an alternative solution to HSS steel. On the contrary, TiBN and CrN provide anti-adhesion protection up to the maximum load of the test, like C...|$|R

Major part was casting of strip at the experiment casting facility. A new caster, capable of producing direct cast strip of up to 12 in. wide in heats of 1000 and 3000 lb, was used. A total of 81 1000 - 1200 lb heats were cast as well as one test heat of 3000 lb. Most produced strip of from 0. 016 to 0. 085 in. thick.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the potential for}} strip casting in the steel industry and to develop the fundamental knowledge necessary to allow the role of strip casting in the modern steel industry to be understood. Based upon a study of <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> castings that were either produced for the program at British Steel or were received from a pre-commercial production machine, the following conclusions were made. <b>Strip</b> casting of <b>carbon</b> <b>steels</b> is technically feasible for sheet material from slightly less than 1 mm thick to 3 mm thick, and, assuming that it is economically viable, it will be first applied in <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> markets {{that do not require}} stringent surface quality or extensive forming. The potential of strip casting as a casting process to be developed for steel castings is very high as the cast strip has some very novel characteristics. Direct cast carbon strip has better surface quality, shape and profile than any other casting process currently available. The more rapidly solidified structure of direct cast strip tends to be strong with low ductility; however, with adequate thermal treatment, it is possible to develop a variety of properties from the same grade. The process is more amenable at this time to production tonnages per year of the order of 500, 000 tons and as such will first find niche type applications. This technology is an additional technology for steel production and will be in addition to, rather than a replacement for, current casting machines...|$|R

The figure of the residual stress distribution along the width direction is like the shape of the letter “M”. Residual stress of the strip is reduced after tempering. When tempering at 450 °C or 500 °C, evolution {{of residual}} stress is caused by changes of thermal stress. Distribution of residual stress becomes gentle.

40|$|AbstractThe {{abundance}} {{of iron and}} aluminum raw materials is often quoted as a strategic advantage of iron aluminides against other competing materials (not only stainless steels, but also nickel and titanium aluminides). These raw materials, however, are not only abundant {{in the form of}} ores in earth's crust, but also as scrap produced in the extensive technological activity associated with these base metals. The present work reports results of two prospective experiments designed for obtaining iron aluminides exclusively from readily available scrap (aluminum cans, <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> <b>strips</b> and stainless steel sheet metal forming residues, this last as a source of chromium and molybdenum). Two base alloys with nominal composition Fe– 30 Al– 6 Cr and different carbon contents were molten in a laboratory induction furnace with no atmosphere protection other than blowing Argon over the melt surface. The produced ingots were characterized concerning their microstructures and final composition, which allows estimating the incorporation efficiency of the alloying elements using this processing route. Oxidation tests at the temperature range of 800 – 1100 °C under air were performed to demonstrate that these alloys show similar behavior as the ones obtained using conventional processing routes. The results are discussed concerning the viability of this low-cost processing route for the industrial production of iron aluminides...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Steel strips {{covered by}} a {{tertiary}} thermal oxide scale from a hot rolling process were studied in this research work. In case that the clean strip is required, i. e. for the cold rolling process, this tertiary scale formed on the steel surface is typically removed by a pickling process. In this work, a finishing temperature – the temperature at the exit of strip from a finishing mill – was kept constant at 830 ˚C. A coiling temperature – the temperature that the strip was coiled at a down coiler – was varied in a real hot rolling line to obtain different types of tertiary scales formed on low <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> <b>strips.</b> Physico-chemical characteristics and pickling behaviour of the scales were further investigated. It was found from a scanning electron microscope (SEM) that the thickness of scale at the centre of strip was {{in the range of}} 3 - 5 µ m and reduced with the decrease in coiling temperature. A laser Raman spectroscopy was also applied to make a depth profile of scale. Additionally, with the results observed from SEM and X-ray diffraction (XRD), it is concluded that the tertiary scale is a non-homogeneous single layer of a eutectoid structure consisting of magnetite and iron. Moreover, the samples were further immersed in a 10 %v/v HCl pickling solution at 80 ˚C. It was found that the time needed to remove the tertiary scale was reduced with the decreased scale thickness, which was obtained by lowering the coiling temperature. Kinetics of scale removal during pickling is discussed in the paper...|$|E

A unique automated impact fatigue test system has been designed and produced, which enables to carry out impact fatigue tests of the compressor valve leaves under the desired impact velocities. The test system serves investigations on the impact fatigue characteristics with the ability of crack detection and as the subsequent step of automatically terminating the test. The crack detection technique incorporates a non-contact actuation, a data acquisition system and a microphone. The investigation relates the impact fatigue lifetime of the valve leaves with the impact velocity, asymmetrical impact, operation temperature, material type (<b>carbon</b> <b>strip</b> <b>steel,</b> stainless <b>strip</b> <b>steel</b> and new stainless <b>strip</b> <b>steel</b> grade) and tumbling operation duration.

As the crack propagates, branching along the crack path is caused by the geometrical shape and stress waves on the valve leaves.

40|$|AbstractReactive {{annealing}} of semi-processed electrical steels is {{an important}} process to reduce electro-magnetic losses. The annealing process involves heating of the <b>steel</b> <b>strip,</b> which is passed continuously through the furnace, to a certain temperature. The heated <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> gets decarburised and annealed in a warm gas atmosphere containing N 2 -H 2 -H 2 OCO-CO 2 mixture. The composition of the warm gas atmosphere {{plays a major role}} in both the decarburisation and selective oxidation of <b>carbon</b> from the <b>steel</b> <b>strip.</b> The furnace settings are often changed to cater for products with different metallurgical properties and varying dimensions. Often the line speed of the process too needs to be changed to cater to varying input parameters of the <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> such as composition, width, thickness etc. Thus an advanced mathematical model based system is desired to optimize the running of the furnace to achieve the desired properties at improved productivity. For effective control of system, mathematical model for the heating of the <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> is developed. Decarburisation model for the <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> has been coupled with the thermal model. The model takes in various inputs like line speed, composition of the <b>steel</b> <b>strip,</b> width and its thickness. Temperatures in the different zones of the furnace along with the decarburising gas flow rate, H 2 /H 2 O ratio etc, are taken as input parameters. The model predicts the thermal profile of the <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> inside the furnace. It also predicts the carbon composition in the <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> along the length of the furnace. Based on optimized temperature and carbon profile for different grades, the model suggests the desired line speed and the temperature settings in the different zones of the furnace. If there is a mismatch in the desired and the actual line speed the model also generates the desired set points of temperature for increasing or decreasing the furnace temperature which is downloaded to PLC in order to control the furnace parameters in real-time...|$|R
