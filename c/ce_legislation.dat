40|$|Singapore is a late adopter of {{compulsory}} education (CE). Six {{years of schooling}} for all children became compulsory in Singapore in 2003 (Ministry of Education, 2009). Surrounding Southeast Asian countries passed {{compulsory education}} legislation in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. Countries such as the Philippines adopted compulsory education in 1899, and Thailand in 1921. However, Malaysia, similar to Singapore, adopted <b>CE</b> <b>legislation</b> in the early-twenty-first century. In order to explain Singapore 2 ̆ 7 s adoption of <b>CE</b> <b>legislation,</b> we must look further into each country 2 ̆ 7 s reasons for implementing it. Singapore reported in 2000 that its dropout rate was 0. 4 percent at the primary level and 3. 5 percent {{at the secondary level}} (Committee on Compulsory Education, 2000). These findings indicate that school attendance was virtually universal even before the time <b>CE</b> <b>legislation</b> was implemented. By one measure, then, CE may be considered unnecessary; however, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong stressed the importance of every child attending school and being granted the 2 ̆ 2 same head start to developing her or his potential to the fullest 2 ̆ 2 (Committee on Compulsory Education, 2000). His concerns were dealing with two emerging trends during 1999, which would undermine Singapore 2 ̆ 7 s efforts to become a world-class economy and home to its citizens (Committee on Compulsory Education, 2000). One trend reported the population rate was declining. A second trend reported an increase in Singaporeans living overseas. The prime minister believed that enacting <b>CE</b> <b>legislation</b> would reverse the aforementioned trends by requiring children to attend school. The research question of this thesis is 2 ̆ 2 How do we explain Singapore 2 ̆ 7 s adoption of <b>CE</b> <b>legislation</b> in 2003 ? 2 ̆ 2 In order to answer my question, I will provide some background and context to the Singaporean case by first discussing the passage of <b>CE</b> <b>legislation</b> in four other Southeast Asian countries. I will compare and contrast each case by examining the different roles that <b>CE</b> <b>legislation</b> has played in each country for the purpose of better understanding Singapore 2 ̆ 7 s implementation of <b>CE</b> <b>legislation.</b> Another way to further my comprehension of Singapore 2 ̆ 7 s adoption of <b>CE</b> <b>legislation</b> is to examine general reasons for the adoption of <b>CE</b> <b>legislation</b> through analyzing theoretical perspectives based on Western ideologies. The thesis will also include a literature review, which will provide background information on the past two decades of the educational systems in Singapore to reveal further details on Singapore 2 ̆ 7 s education and how <b>CE</b> <b>legislation</b> is related. I will analyze policy statements, speeches, and popular press releases to illuminate the implications of <b>CE</b> <b>legislation</b> in Singapore...|$|E
40|$|Mycotoxins are {{chemical}} substances produced by fungal species belonging mostly to Aspergillus, Penicillium and Fusarium, {{and having a}} toxic effect on humans and farm animals. In recent years health authorities have dedicated much attention to food contamination by mycotoxins, especially with regards to aflatoxins, fumonisin, ocratoxin A, patulin, trichothecenes e zearalenone. The current European <b>legislation</b> <b>CE</b> n. 1881 / 2006 and n. 1126 / 2007 establish the maximum levels of mycotoxins allowed in human food. Despite {{the existence of such}} legislation, regulations regarding certain products are not very clear (i. e. milk products). More interest should be paid to these food products in terms of regulations and testing...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{license plates}} have likely been used since the {{promulgation}} of the Motor Vehicle Act, Rattanakosin Era 128 (1910 <b>CE),</b> the earliest <b>legislation</b> of which details are available is from 1967. The size of license plates was specified at 11 by 39 centimeters, with white text {{on a black}} background. A two-letter abbreviation of the province name, arranged vertically, was displayed to the left, and the registration ID, consisting of either a five-digit serial number or a single series letter and a four-digit serial number, was displayed to the right, e.g., [...] "(ก.ท.) 01234" [...] or [...] "(ก.ท.) ก-0123". This was changed in 1975 to black-on-white plates with a size of 15 by 30 centimeters. The series identifier for Bangkok was also changed to consist of one-digit number plus one letter, e.g., [...] "1ก-0123". The province name was given in full under the ID, as in the current system. The serial number was displayed with leading zeros, which were dropped, along with the dash, when the current format was adopted in 1997.|$|R
