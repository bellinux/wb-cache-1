40|$|<b>Conical</b> <b>wedge</b> {{anchorages}} {{are frequently}} used to anchor steel tendons in prestressing applications within the construction industry. To replace the steel tendons with non-corrosive and low weight FRPs (Fiber Reinforced Polymers), the different mechanical {{interactions between the}} steel and FRPs call for further development of the anchorage. In this paper, we derive and examine an analytical model for the internal stresses and strains within the anchorage for a prescribed presetting distance. This model {{is derived from the}} theory of thick walled cylinders under the assumptions regarding plane stress and axial symmetry. We simplify the resulting system of ten nonlinear equations and derive a method for solving them numerically. A comparison of plotted results for three different angles on the wedge's outer surface and six different presetting distances follows. These results are also compared to both axi-symmetric and 3 D FE (Finite Element) models. Analytical and FE axi-symmetric models show good correspondence, though compared to the 3 D FE model, they show a clear difference in the predicted radial stress distribution on the FRP. Thus, the derived analytical model can be a useful and fasteralternative to FE modeling of axi-symmetric anchorages. However, the model is of more restricted value and should be complemented by, for example, 3 D FE models for other designs.

40|$|During Compression Testing, a solid {{specimen}} (Hexagonal in Cross-Section) is compressed axially {{between the}} punch {{and the bottom}} plates. As a result of this, the work piece material undergoes deformation which basically is Bulging at its centre position. This test can further be carried out at different temperatures to record the nature of compression for different ranges of temperatures. In Compression or Upsetting, the presence of frictional constraints between the dies and the work piece directly affects the plastic deformation of the work piece. The friction at the faces of contact retards the plastic flow of metals around the surface and in its vicinity. A <b>conical</b> <b>wedge</b> of a relatively undeformed metal is formed directly below it {{while the rest of}} the cylindrical metal suffers high strain hardening and subsequently bulges out. However, in practice, the use of lubricants greatly reduces the degree of bulging to a great extent. Hence it is necessary to apply a correction factor for the purpose of bulging design of die. For a ductile material like Aluminium used here lateral distortion takes place and due to restraining influence of friction of the load faces, the cross section becomes greater at the centre, the test piece taking up a barrel shape. Hence this is also termed as Barreling. In this particular experimentation the behavior of Aluminium specimen under different loading conditions and at room temperature is recorded and the data thus generated is utilized in predicting the behavior of Aluminium and other metals under cold loading conditions...|$|E

In this paper, a finite element model for predicting the reflection characteristics of a wedge in an impedance tube is proposed.

The theoretical predictions are compared with those of the experimental results reported elsewhere.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets during the afterglow phase is most reliably and accurately modeled using hydrodynamic simulations. All published simulations so far, however, have considered only a uniform external medium, while a stratified external medium is expected around long duration GRB progenitors. Here, we present simulations of the {{dynamics of}} GRB jets and the resulting afterglow emission for both uniform and stratified external media with rho(ext) alpha r(-k) for k = 0, 1, 2. The simulations are performed in two dimensions using the special relativistic version of the Mezcal code. Common to all calculations is the initiation of the GRB jet as a <b>conical</b> <b>wedge</b> of half-opening angle theta(0) = 0. 2 whose radial profile is taken from the self-similar Blandford-McKee solution. The dynamics for stratified external media (k = 1, 2) are broadly similar to those derived for expansion into a uniform external medium (k = 0). The jet half-opening angle is observed to start increasing logarithmically with time (or radius) once the Lorentz factor G drops below theta(- 1) (0). For larger k values, however, the lateral expansion is faster at early times (when Gamma >theta(- 1) (0)) and slower at late times with the jet expansion becoming Newtonian and slowly approaching spherical symmetry over progressively longer timescales. We find that, contrary to analytic expectations, there is a reasonably sharp jet break in the light curve for k = 2 (a wind-like external medium), although the shape of the break is affected more by the viewing angle (for theta(obs) <= theta(0)) than by the slope of the external density profile (for 0 <= k <= 2). Steeper density profiles (i. e., increasing k values) are found to produce more gradual jet breaks while larger viewing angles cause smoother and later appearing jet breaks. The counterjet becomes visible as it becomes sub-relativistic, and for k = 0 this results in a clear bump-like feature in the light curve. However, for larger k values the jet decelerates more gradually, causing only a mild flattening in the radio light curve that might be hard to discern when k = 2. Late-time radio calorimetry, which makes use of a spherical flow approximation near the non-relativistic transition, is likely to consistently overestimate the true energy by up to a factor of a few for k = 2, but likely to either overpredict or underpredict it by a smaller factor for k = 0, 1...|$|E
40|$|The nanoindentation {{fracture}} {{behavior of}} gallium arsenide (GaAs) is examined from two perspectives in two parent papers. The first paper (part I) focuses on in situ nanoindentation within a {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM) and on fractographic observations of cleaved cross-sections of indented regions to investigate the crack field under various indenter geometries. In the second parent paper (part II), cathodoluminescence and transmission electron microscopy are used to investigate the relationship between dislocation and crack fields. The combination of instrumented in situ scanning electron microscopy nanoindentations and cleavage cross-sectioning allows us to establish a detailed map of cracking in the indented region and cracking kinetics for <b>conical</b> and <b>wedge</b> indenter shapes. For wedge nanoindentations, {{the evolution of the}} half-penny crack size with the indentation load is interpreted using a simple linear elastic fracture model based on weight functions. Fracture toughness estimates obtained by this technique fall within the range of usual values quoted for GaA...|$|R
40|$|We {{show how}} the {{infinite}} color-Coulomb energy of color-charged states is related to enhanced density of near-zero modes of the Faddeev-Popov operator, and calculate this density numerically for both pure Yang-Mills and gauge-Higgs systems at zero temperature, and for pure gauge theory in the deconfined phase. We find that the enhancement of the eigenvalue density {{is tied to the}} presence of percolating center vortex configurations, and that this property disappears when center vortices are either removed from the lattice configurations, or cease to percolate. We further demonstrate that thin center vortices have a special geometrical status in gauge-field configuration space: Thin vortices are located at <b>conical</b> or <b>wedge</b> singularities on the Gribov horizon. We show that the Gribov region is itself a convex manifold in lattice configuration space. The Coulomb gauge condition also has a special status; it is shown to be an attractive fixed point of a more general gauge condition, interpolating between the Coulomb and Landau gauges.

40|$|This {{work was}} carried out to {{describe}} the morphological characteristics of the choanal slit of the turkey through gross, light, and scanning electron microscopy. The choanal slit measures 27. 62 mm long, and constitutes 38. 30 % of the total length of the palate. The edges of the narrow part of the choanal slit is smooth rostrally but slightly thickened caudally due {{to the presence of}} 2 - 3 small papillae. The edge of the wide part is thickened because of presence of 5 - 7 <b>conical</b> and <b>wedge</b> shaped papillae. SEM indicates the presence of median fold within the choana, which represents the direct continuation of the median palatine ridge. After a short distance, this fold bifurcates into right and left folds. Several openings of the palatine salivary glands are demonstrated on the palate {{at the level of the}} choanal slit. The epithelium of the oral roof at the level of the choanal slit is stratified squamous epithelium showing intraepithelial sensory corpuscles. This epithelium transforms at the edge of the choanal slit into pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium that interrupted by intraepithelial mucous glands surrounded by lymphatic infiltration and nodules. Altogether, this study provides inclusive information on the macroscopic and microscopic morphological features of the choana in the turkey in comparing with those of the other birds...|$|R

30|$|In {{the theory}} of pseudo-differential {{equations}} the main difficulty is studying model operators in canonical domains according to a local principle. It shows that for a Fredholm property of a general pseudo-differential operator on a compact manifold one needs the invertibility of its local representatives in each point of a manifold [1, 2]. The author wrote many times {{on the nature of}} these local representatives, these are distinct in dependence on a point of a manifold. Each ‘singularity’ of a compact manifold (a half-space is a model situation for the smooth part of a boundary, cone for the <b>conical</b> point, <b>wedge,</b> etc.) corresponds to a certain distribution, and a convolution operator with this distribution describes a local representative of an initial pseudo-differential operator in a corresponding point of the manifold. All details can be found in [3 – 5]. But singularities can be of distinct dimensions and it is possible that such singularities of a low dimension can be obtained from analogous singularities of full dimension. This means we need to find distributions for limit cases when some of the parameters of the singularities tend to zero. This approach was partially realized in [6, 7], and [5] is devoted to multi-dimensional constructions. Our idea is the following. Limiting operators for thin singularities obtained in [6] may be a zero approximation for such thin singularities. It is desirable to obtain an asymptotic expansion with a small parameter for the distribution corresponding to such a singularity. We will consider here a two-dimensional case and hope these studies will help us to transfer such constructions to multi-dimensional situations [5].|$|R
40|$|We use a mix {{of field}} theoretic and {{holographic}} techniques to elucidate various properties of quantum entanglement entropy. In (3 + 1) -dimensional conformal field theory we study the divergent terms in the entropy when the entangling surface has a <b>conical</b> or a <b>wedge</b> singularity. In (2 + 1) -dimensional field theory with a mass gap we calculate, for an arbitrary smooth entanglement contour, {{the expansion of the}} entropy in inverse odd powers of the mass. We show that the shape-dependent coefficients that arise are even powers of the extrinsic curvature and its derivatives. A useful dual construction of a (2 + 1) -dimensional theory, which allows us to exhibit these properties, is provided by the CGLP background. This smooth warped throat solution of 11 -dimensional supergravity describes renormalization group flow from a conformal field theory in the UV to a gapped one in the IR. For this flow we calculate the recently introduced renormalized entanglement entropy and confirm that it is a monotonic function.
