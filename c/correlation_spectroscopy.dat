After elucidating the detailed molecular structure of two gum ghatti fractions, the structure of its component glycoprotein was investigated whereby, the protein sequence and hydrophobicity were identified, followed by the conformational analysis of the gum and its fractions. Many techniques were used for the elucidation of the fine structures, which included methylation analysis-GC-MS, Maldi-TOF MS and 2 D NMR <b>spectroscopy,</b> homonuclear ¹H/¹H <b>correlations</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (COSY, TOCSY), heteronuclear ¹³C/¹H multiple-quantum coherence spectroscopy (HMQC) and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC).

25|$|PICS is a {{powerful}} analysis tool that resolves correlations on the nanometer length and millisecond timescale. Adapted from methods of spatio-temporal image <b>correlation</b> <b>spectroscopy,</b> it exploits the high positional accuracy of single-particle tracking. While conventional tracking methods break down if multiple particle trajectories intersect, this method works in principle for arbitrarily large molecule densities and dynamical parameters (e.g. diffusion coefficients, velocities) as long as individual molecules can be identified. It is computationally cheap and robust and allows one to identify and quantify motions (e.g. diffusion, active transport, confined diffusion) within an ensemble of particles, without any a priori knowledge about the dynamics.|$|E
25|$|Nonlinear {{two-dimensional}} {{infrared spectroscopy}} is the infrared version of <b>correlation</b> <b>spectroscopy.</b> Nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy {{is a technique}} that has become available {{with the development of}} femtosecond infrared laser pulses. In this experiment, first a set of pump pulses is applied to the sample. This is followed by a waiting time during which the system is allowed to relax. The typical waiting time lasts from zero to several picoseconds, and the duration can be controlled with a resolution of tens of femtoseconds. A probe pulse is then applied, resulting in the emission of a signal from the sample. The nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectrum is a two-dimensional correlation plot of the frequency ω1 that was excited by the initial pump pulses and the frequency ω3 excited by the probe pulse after the waiting time. This allows the observation of coupling between different vibrational modes; because of its extremely fine time resolution, {{it can be used to}} monitor molecular dynamics on a picosecond timescale. It is still a largely unexplored technique and is becoming increasingly popular for fundamental research.|$|E
2500|$|With unlabelled protein {{the usual}} {{procedure}} is {{to record a}} set of two dimensional homonuclear nuclear magnetic resonance experiments through <b>correlation</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (COSY), of which several types include conventional <b>correlation</b> <b>spectroscopy,</b> total <b>correlation</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (TOCSY) and [...] nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY). A two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance experiment produces a two-dimensional spectrum. The units of both axes are chemical shifts. The COSY and TOCSY transfer magnetization through the chemical bonds between adjacent protons. The conventional <b>correlation</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> experiment is only able to transfer magnetization between protons on adjacent atoms, whereas in the total <b>correlation</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> experiment the protons are able to relay the magnetization, so it is transferred among all the protons that are connected by adjacent atoms. Thus in a conventional <b>correlation</b> <b>spectroscopy,</b> an alpha proton transfers magnetization to the beta protons, the beta protons transfers to the alpha and gamma protons, if any are present, then the gamma proton transfers to the beta and the delta protons, and the process continues. In total <b>correlation</b> <b>spectroscopy,</b> the alpha {{and all the other}} protons are able to transfer magnetization to the beta, gamma, delta, epsilon if they are connected by a continuous chain of protons. [...] The continuous chain of protons are the sidechain of the individual amino acids. Thus these two experiments are used to build so called spin systems, that is build a list of resonances of the chemical shift of the peptide proton, the alpha protons and all the protons from each residue’s sidechain. Which chemical shifts corresponds to which nuclei in the spin system is determined by the conventional <b>correlation</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> connectivities and the fact that different types of protons have characteristic chemical shifts. To connect the different spinsystems in a sequential order, the nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy experiment has to be used. Because this experiment transfers magnetization through space, it will show crosspeaks for all protons that are close in space regardless of whether they are in the same spin system or not. The neighbouring residues are inherently close in space, so the assignments can be made by the peaks in the NOESY with other spin systems.|$|E

The polymeric materials, having a molar content of photochromic units comprised between 5 and 100 % and molecular weights of about 15000, were characterized by an almost random distribution of monomeric units and a glass transition temperature ranging from 35 to 131 degrees C. Polymer samples having a content of aromatic units larger than 75 % were characterized by a thermotropic liquid crystalline structure, as evidenced by optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction and DSC measurements.

40|$|The {{movement}} of macromolecules in cells {{is assumed to}} occur either through active transport or by diffusion. However, {{the determination of the}} diffusion coefficients in cells using fluctuation methods or FRAP frequently give diffusion coefficient that are orders of magnitude smaller than the diffusion coefficients measured for the same macromolecule in solution. It is assumed that the cell internal viscosity is partially responsible for this decrease in the apparent diffusion. When the apparent diffusion is too slow to be due to cytoplasm viscosity, it is assumed that weak binding of the macromolecules to immobile or quasi immobile structures is taking place. In this article, we derive equations for fitting of the RICS (Raster-scan Image <b>Correlations</b> <b>Spectroscopy)</b> data in cells to a model that includes transient binding to immobile structures, and we show that under some conditions, the spatio-temporal correlation provided by the RICS approach can distinguish the process of diffusion and weak binding.

2500|$|<b>Correlation</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> is one {{of several}} types of {{two-dimensional}} nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy or 2D-NMR. This type of NMR experiment is best known by its acronym, COSY. Other types of two-dimensional NMR include J-spectroscopy, exchange spectroscopy (EXSY), Nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY), total <b>correlation</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (TOCSY) and heteronuclear correlation experiments, such as HSQC, HMQC, and HMBC. In <b>correlation</b> <b>spectroscopy,</b> emission is centered on the peak of an individual nucleus; if its magnetic field is correlated with another nucleus by through-bond (COSY, HSQC, etc.) or through-space (NOE) coupling, a response can also be detected on the frequency of the correlated nucleus. Two-dimensional NMR spectra provide more information about a molecule than one-dimensional NMR spectra and are especially useful in determining the structure of a molecule, particularly for molecules that are too complicated to work with using one-dimensional NMR. [...] The first two-dimensional experiment, COSY, was proposed by Jean Jeener, a professor at Université Libre de Bruxelles, in 1971. [...] This experiment was later implemented by Walter P. Aue, Enrico Bartholdi and Richard R. Ernst, who published their work in 1976.|$|E

In this work the ferromagnetic semiconductors were investigated by the hyperfine interactions of implanted nuclear probes using the PAC (perturbed angular <b>correlations)</b> <b>spectroscopy.</b> In such compounds both magnetic hyperfine fields (Bhf) and electric field gradients (efg) allow a detailed study {{of the behavior of}} probes, which can additionally represent essential doping atoms in these substances.

40|$|The SrMO 3 {{compounds}} with M = Ru, Zr ó Hf display similar structures. They are orthorhombic at {{room temperature}} (RT) and transform into tetragonal (14 /mcm) and cubic (Pm 3 m) at higher temperatures. These structures are characterized by rotations of the quasi-rigid oxygen octahedron through different axes. As temperature increases the rotation axes changes at the transition temperature but the M-O distances remain almost constant (1 %) in the whole temperature range. The crystallographic study of the tetragonal to cubic transformation shows that it occurs by the rotation ø(T C) → 0 of the rigid oxygen octahedron about the c axis. This transition is of second order and can be described by ø(T) ∼ ø 0 (T C -T) β. β is the critical exponent and was fitted to 1 / 2, 1 / 4 and 1 / 8 for M = Hf, Zr and Ru, respectively.

2500|$|Heteronuclear <b>correlation</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> gives signal {{based upon}} {{coupling}} between nuclei {{of two different}} types.

[...] For historical reasons, experiments which record the proton rather than the heteronucleus spectrum during the detection period are called [...] "inverse" [...] experiments. [...] This is because the low natural abundance of most heteronuclei {{would result in the}} proton spectrum being overwhelmed with signals from molecules with no active heteronuclei, making it useless for observing the desired, coupled signals. [...] With the advent of techniques for suppressing these undesired signals, inverse correlation experiments such as HSQC, HMQC, and HMBC are actually much more common today.

2500|$|When {{the motion}} is slow (in biology, for example, {{diffusion}} in a membrane), getting adequate statistics from a single-point FCS experiment {{may take a}} prohibitively long time.
