According to Universal Studios, the ride is able to save over 55,000 watts on average and 662,000 watt-hours per day.

5|$|During {{the course}} of the thirteenth century, the Bilwis is less and less {{frequently}} treated as the personification of a supernatural power but becomes increasingly identified as a malevolent human being, a witch. Still later, with the rise of the witch persecution {{at the end of the}} Middle Ages, the Bilwis was demonized; she becomes an incarnation of the devil for the witch and sorcerer. A final development has taken place since the sixteenth century, especially in northeast Germany, the Bilwis has been conceived of as a grain spirit bringing wealth; yet this latest manifestation of the Bilwis has its harmful side, the Bilwis-cutter, who is blamed for the unexplained patterns that are formed among the rows of standing grain. The cutter is a sorcerer or witch that <b>cuts</b> <b>down</b> the corn with sickles that are fastened to its feet. He is classified as an essentially malevolent Corn Spirit. Thus, the Bilwis is exceedingly polymorphous, taking on many appearances and meaning in all German-speaking areas throughout the Middle Ages. The Bilwis is one of the strangest and most mysterious beings in all folklore; its varying forms reflect the concerns of a farm culture, and it serves to explain the eerie appearance of turned-down rows of plants in cornfields.|$|E
25|$|Green {{publishing}} means {{adapting the}} publishing process to minimise environmental impact.

25|$|When photographing or {{shooting}} {{video of}} shy animals which are easily disturbed, {{it is more}} likely to be successful if there is only one diver potentially disturbing the subjects. The disturbance can also be reduced by buddy diving on rebreathers, which <b>cuts</b> <b>down</b> on bubble noise, but at the cost of increased risk due to the inherently higher number of failure modes characteristic of rebreathers. It is not clear which system has the lower overall risk.|$|E
25|$|Further {{down in the}} Kobuk watershed, {{the river}} worked {{in concert with the}} wind to create one of the more famous landforms in Alaska: the Kobuk Dunes. These large sand dunes are the modern {{ancestor}} of alluvial deposits that became shaped and dominated by an exchange of aeolian and fluvial processes. In moister climates, the river has more water, and thus more power, and <b>cuts</b> <b>down</b> through a sandy bed. In times of drier climate, wind dominates and blows a lot of sediment into a weaker fluvial system, leading to aggradation and floodplain re-distribution.|$|E
25|$|Linerlock {{mechanisms}} are most commonly composed of titanium alloy or steel. The linerlock's locking side liner is split {{from the top}} toward the bottom, similar to an automotive leaf spring (also called a lock bar) that butts up against the tang of the blade to prevent the blade from closing. In an interview with Blade in 1988, Walker stated, “This long leaf-spring effect <b>cuts</b> <b>down</b> on stress on the locking mechanism". As the lock on the original electrician's knife was mostly to hold a screwdriver blade open (the knife blade, itself was secured by a slip joint method), Walker's refinements prevented the knife blade from closing on the user's hand and converted it into a true lock.|$|E

He invites Plog and the actors to shelter in his castle, where he believes they will be safer from the plague. Along the way, the party encounters Skat and Lisa in the forest. Dissatisfied with her new lover (and well aware that her husband will rapidly forgive her), Lisa rapidly abandons Skat and returns to Plog, while Skat uses his acting skills—and possibly Jof's collusion—to fake a remorseful suicide. Once the group has moved on, Skat climbs a tree for the night. Appearing and informing the actor that his time is up, Death then <b>cuts</b> <b>down</b> the tree and kills him.|$|E
25|$|When {{dragged through}} a field the coulter <b>cuts</b> <b>down</b> {{into the soil}} and the share cuts {{horizontally}} from the previous furrow to the vertical cut. This releases a rectangular strip of sod that is then lifted by the share and carried by the mouldboard up and over, so that the strip of sod (slice of the topsoil) that is being cut lifts and rolls over as the plough moves forward, dropping {{back to the ground}} upside down into the furrow and onto the turned soil from the previous run down the field. Each gap in the ground where the soil has been lifted and moved across (usually to the right) is called a furrow. The sod that has been lifted from it rests at about a 45 degree angle in the next-door furrow and lies up the back of the sod from the previous run.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, New York City cut {{funding for}} the state's 76 zoos, aquariums, and botanical gardens. The Wildlife Conservation Society as a whole {{suffered}} a $15-million deficit and the zoo was forced to downsize its staff and animal collection. The budget cuts forced the buyouts of over 100 employees and layoffs of dozens more {{as well as the}} closure of four sections of the zoo: World of Darkness, Rare Animal Range, the Skyfari, and a small section of the overall still-open African Plains exhibit which featured endangered antelope. In the end, 186 staff positions (15%) were cut within the WCS. In 2012, Mayor Michael Bloomberg passed another budget cut that took $4.7-million from the funding of the zoo and the New York Aquarium, which is also run by the WCS. This cut represented more than half of what the collections were receiving. However, he also passed an energy subsidy that brought the <b>cuts</b> <b>down</b> to $3.7-million.|$|E

25|$|The Prince {{then takes}} Elika's body outside. There are four Fertile Grounds there, {{each with a}} tree, that {{according}} to what Elika had told him, channel the power of all the Fertile Grounds to the Tree of Life. He is given a vision {{which is the same}} one both he and Elika shared much earlier that shows her father's deal with Ahriman to revive her. When they shared the vision at that time she told the Prince that visions come from Ormazd, not Ahriman. The vision (just like the main debate throughout the game between Elika and the Prince was all about Destiny vs Free Will) is all about choice. The Prince re-creates the deal made by Elika's father. He destroys the four Fertile Grounds around the Temple and returns inside. He <b>cuts</b> <b>down</b> the Tree of Life and takes the light power Elika used to heal the Tree. The Prince returns the Light to Elika's body, and she returns to life. The game ends with the Prince carrying Elika across the desert while Ahriman's darkness envelops the world.|$|E
