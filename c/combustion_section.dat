40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{environmental}} aspects of combustor modification on Nuovo Pignone gas turbines. The mentioned company is engaged in the transport of natural gas to the Slovak Republic and further to other European markets. Legislation considering emissions is getting stricter every year. Original Nuovo Pignone gas turbines {{would not be able}} to meet the required emission limits for NOx and COr determined by legislation. Therefore, the company decided to modify seven gas turbines. Due to this reason, the <b>combustion</b> <b>sections</b> had to be replaced with a dry low emission system. These modifications were aimed at improvement of impacts of temperature on the emissions of NOx, since the NOx emissions are defined as thermal (there is an increase in emissions with the increase in temperature). Emissions were monitored continuously by an emission monitoring system (these data are continuously sent to the Office of Environment) and manually by a HORIBA PG- 250 analyser. Gas delivery point is located in the flue pipeline, and data was processed by means of PC after reaching this point. The results lead us to conclusion that modification was an efficient and good solution in terms of economy, because this solution reduced emissions (from 300 mg·m− 3 to 50 mg·m− 3) and contributed to meeting of the stricter emission limits (from 370 mg·m− 3 to 100 mg·m− 3).

40|$|A {{variety of}} novel {{processes}} are being proposed {{in order to}} face global challenges such as {{degradation of the environment}} and the efficient utilization of energy. Modeling and simulation tools {{play a crucial role in}} the understanding and enhancing of the execution, design and construction of these processes. Although different computational tools are available to quantify the process at different levels, they are normally utilized independently and on a stand-alone basis. This decoupled approach may undermine the true potential of these tools. The present study highlights the advantages of interlinked process modeling at different levels. This study focuses on a promising gasification technology, namely the dual fluidized bed gasifier. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was used to understand the flow patterns inside a fluidized bed. This elevated the understanding of the hydrodynamics of the gasifier freeboard, which is neglected by the conventional two-phase methodology. The CFD simulation was utilized to perform a residence time distribution (RTD) analysis of the reactor. Four tracer approaches namely the frozen velocity approach, the snapshot approach, the data sampling approach and the transient approach, were compared. The RTD analysis formed the basis of a steady-state compartment model that was developed in ASPEN Plus simulation software. The ASPEN Plus gasifier model decoupled the pyrolysis, gasification, and <b>combustion</b> <b>sections</b> of the gasifier to affect a better comprehension of the process and results. The model predicated satisfactory results upon validation. Additionally, the model could also be used to predict the output for different biomass feedstocks.

40|$|Flame structures, blowout {{limits and}} {{emissions}} of swirlstabilized premixed methane-air flames were studied experimentally {{in a small}} atmospheric combustor rig. <b>Combustion</b> <b>sections</b> with rectangular cross section (30 mm by 40 mm) and circular cross section (inner diameter = 39 mm) were used to investigate effects of combustor geometry on the flame's performance. Flame structures and instabilities were obtained from CH∗ chemiluminescence captured by a high speed intensified CMOS camera. Maps of flame blowout limits (ΦBO) versus total mass flow rates (m = 70 ∼ 130 standard liter per minute, SLPM) were obtained with the combustor inlet flow temperature (Tin) kept at Tin = 397 ± 5 K and a flow swirl number of S = 0. 6. Emission data of mole fraction of CO in the exhaust gas versus equivalence ratio was obtained under the conditions of Tin= 293 ± 5 K and S = 0. 66. It is found that the flame became longer and more unstable with decreasing equivalence ratio or increasing total mass flow rates. A strong high-amplitude and low-frequency oscillation {{was found to be}} the reason for the flame blowout. A possible reason for flame instability and blowout is presented in the paper. Within the parameters investigated in this study, the equivalence ratio had the strongest impact on flame stabilities and CO emission. Both in the rectangular and circular combustors, when the flame length increased to a critical value (LIBO, which was approximately the same for these two combustors), flame could not be stabilized anymore and blowout occurred.

The combustion changes that occur for alteration of the operating conditions by changing the equivalence ratios (φ) for CH 4 as fuel at different sections of the burner, were optically investigated. The burner assembly has three concentrically arranged premixed burner sections: an outer Main section, an intermediate section (Pilot) and a central pilot body or pre-chamber combustor, called RPL (Rich-Pilot-Lean) section. All sections are facilitated to vary equivalence ratios to achieve optimal combustion. Planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) of OH radicals and flame chemiluminescence imaging were applied to study the local flame characteristics in order to investigate turbulence-flame interaction and formation of reaction zone at the burner exit. The {{results show that the}} position and shape of the flame are clearly affected by the variation of equivalence ratios at different sections of the burner. During the experiments, first the RPL, then the Pilot and the Main flame were added in a step wise manner keeping constant the total air flow for the global φ= 0. 5 {{in order to understand the}} flame contributions from the different <b>combustion</b> <b>sections.</b> It is observed that for the RPL fuel lean conditions, the primary combustion starts and reaches completion before exiting the burner throat while for rich conditions, the residual fuel escapes out through the RPL exit with primary combustion products and starts secondary combustion along with the Pilot and Main combustion. At the global φ= 0. 5, for changing the RPL φ from lean to rich conditions, the flame stabilization region moves downstream of the burner exit and the flame front fluctuation along inner shear layer increases. For increasing the global φ and increasing the Pilot fuel ratio (PFR) without changing the RPL and the global φ, the total extension of the flame becomes shorter and the flame stabilization region moves upstream...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the extreme}} {{operating}} conditions present in the <b>combustion</b> <b>sections</b> of gas turbines, designers have relied heavily on specialized engineering materials. For blades, which must retain substantial strength and resistance to fatigue, creep, and corrosion at high temperatures, directionally-solidified (DS) nickel-base superalloys have been used extensively. Complex thermomechanical loading histories makes life prediction for such components difficult and subjective. Costly product inspection and refurbishment, as well as capital expense required in turbine forced outage situations, are significant drains on the resources of turbine producers. This places a premium on accurate endurance prediction {{as the foundation of}} viable long-term service contracts with customers. In working towards that end, this work characterizes the behavior of the blade material CM 247 LC DS subjected to a variety of in-phase (IP) and out-of phase (OP) loading cycles in the presence of notch stress concentrations. The material response to multiaxial notch effects, highly anisotropic material behavior, time-dependent deformation, and waveform and temperature cycle characteristics is presented. The active damage mechanisms influencing crack initiation are identified through extensive microscopy as a function of these parameters. This study consisted of an experimental phase as well as a numerical modeling phase. The first involved conducting high temperature thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) tests on both smooth and notched round-bar specimens to compile experimental results. Tests were conducted on longitudinal and transverse material grain orientations. Damage is characterized and conclusions drawn in light of fractography and microscopy. The influences of microstructure morphology and environmental effects on crack initiation are discussed. The modeling phase utilized various finite element (FE) simulations. These included an anisotropic-elastic model to capture the purely elastic notch response, and a continuum-based crystal visco-plastic model developed specifically to compute the material response of a DS Ni-base superalloy based on microstructure and orientation dependencies. These FE simulations were performed to predict and validate experimental results, as well as identify the manifestation of damage mechanisms resulting from thermomechanical fatigue.

50|$|One {{problem with}} both of these early designs, which are called centrifugal-flow engines, was that the {{compressor}} worked by accelerating air outward from the central intake to the outer periphery of the engine, where the air was then compressed by a divergent duct set-up, converting its velocity into pressure. An advantage of this design {{was that it was}} already well understood, having been implemented in centrifugal superchargers, then in widespread use on piston engines. However, given the early technological limitations on the shaft speed of the engine, the compressor needed to have a very large diameter to produce the power required. This meant that the engines had a large frontal area, which made it less useful as an aircraft powerplant due to drag. A further disadvantage of the earlier Whittle designs was that the air flow was reversed through the <b>combustion</b> <b>section</b> and again to the turbine and tailpipe, adding complexity and lowering efficiency. Nevertheless, these types of engines had the major advantages of light weight, simplicity and reliability, and development rapidly progressed to practical airworthy designs.|$|E
