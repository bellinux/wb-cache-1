His trial, compared to the other Plot trials, was reasonably fair, but as in all cases of alleged treason at that date the absence of defence counsel was a fatal handicap, and while Oates' credit had been seriously damaged, the evidence of the principal prosecution witnesses, Turberville and Dugdale, struck even fair minded observers like John Evelyn as being credible enough. Stafford, denied counsel, failed to exploit several inconsistencies in Tuberville's testimony, which a good lawyer might have turned to his <b>client's</b> <b>advantage.</b>|$|R

With music providing the much needed relaxing and bonding factor, the drug dependent person feels more comfortable in the group, free to express feelings and therefore more motivated towards treatment. Following a theoretical motivation, the authors provide useful guidelines for utilizing specific music to gain specific results during group work with drug dependant persons. Articl...|$|R

30|$|The {{challenge}} of a routing protocol is selecting the optimum or minimal path {{to communicate the}} source (e.g., the video server) and the destination (e.g., the mesh <b>client).</b> Taking <b>advantage</b> from the static backbone, the focus of routing protocols for WMNs should be on achieving higher throughput rather than saving energy or improving resiliency for mobility [15]. There are three general categories of routing protocols namely: reactive, proactive, and hybrid [16 – 18]. Reactive protocols only search for a path between two nodes when there are data to send. This method {{has the advantage of}} not wasting network bandwidth with control messages when data transmission is not required. Reactive protocols are ideally suited to an ad hoc network with mobile nodes where data path may change continuously whereas proactive protocols actively establish and maintain data paths for nodes whether data are needed to be transferred or not. The advantage of this kind of protocol is a low latency in sending data through the network since an optimized data path is already known before the transmission. Nevertheless, this comes at a price in terms of higher cost of network overhead associated to both network control messages and computational processing.|$|R
