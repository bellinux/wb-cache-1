40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{investigate the}} impact of visibility of information about <b>contributors</b> on contributions in the public goods game. We systematically consider several treatments {{that are similar to}} a wide range of situations in practice. First, we vary the cost of viewing identifiable information about <b>contributors.</b> Second, we vary recognizing all, top or bottom <b>contributors.</b> We find that recognizing all <b>contributors</b> significantly increases contributions relative to the baseline. Recognizing only the top <b>contributors</b> is not significantly different from not recognizing <b>contributors,</b> but recognizing only the bottom <b>contributors</b> is as effective as recognizing all <b>contributors.</b> When viewing information about <b>contributors</b> is costly, there is no significant difference in contributions as compared to the case where all <b>contributors</b> are displayed by default.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to identify the <b>contributors</b> to optimal sexual experiences. At present, {{there is a lack of}} clinical knowledge, research knowledge and in-depth public discourse concerning the nature of healthy sexuality. The theoretical and research literature in this area has focused almost exclusively on defining and conceptualizing sexual dysfunctions with little attention paid to either normal or satisfactory experiences. Very little theory exists on the nature and components of optimal sexuality. To date, no empirical investigations have been done to determine the <b>contributors</b> to optimal sexual experiences. In order to identify the <b>contributors</b> to optimal sexual experiences, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 individuals who reported having experienced “great sex”. A phenomenologically-oriented content analysis was performed on interview transcripts to determine the <b>contributors</b> to optimal sexual experiences. Analysis led to the identification of seven major <b>contributors,</b> two pathways towards optimal sexual experiences and two minor <b>contributors.</b> The major <b>contributors</b> included developmental <b>contributors,</b> individual qualities overall, individual qualities in-the moment, skills, relationship qualities overall, relationship qualities in-the-moment and environmental, situational and preparatory <b>contributors.</b> Each of these larger themes was also characterized by a variety of more specific themes. The two pathways that led to optimal sexual experiences included individual qualities that facilitated relationship qualities and relationship qualities that facilitated individual qualities. Finally, the minor <b>contributors</b> consisted of personal proclivities and miscellaneous <b>contributors.</b> Noteworthy findings of this investigation are discussed and then compared and contrasted with existing research and theory. The implications of this work for the general public, sex therapy, sex education, theory and research are considered as well as the strengths and limitations of this study...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the origin}} of agile methods and open source development, code {{ownership}} {{tends to be more}} widely distributed over multiple <b>contributors</b> than before. The question is to what extent a component is a↵ected when several developers contribute to it. Does several <b>contributors</b> provide better solutions than a sole developer or does multiple <b>contributors</b> generate additional defects? Although some previous research results point to the fact that more <b>contributors</b> do expose a project to higher risk, surprisingly little has been done to validate this hypothesis. An answer to this question is highly relevant since it provides organizations with the option to adjust development teams and contribution levels accordingly, in order to assure software quality. By empirically studying a large data set from a proprietary telecommunications company, we examine the relationship between the number of <b>contributors</b> and the number of defects in closed source industrial projects. In addition, we are the first to investigate the e↵ect that multiple <b>contributors</b> have on defect density and defect severity. We find the correlation between <b>contributors</b> and defect density to be statistically significant and we find that the number of <b>contributors</b> and the number of defects has a near perfect positive relationship...|$|R
