Approximately 54% of The Colbert Report and The Daily Show viewers scored in the high knowledge range, followed by Jim Lehrer's program at 53% and Bill O'Reilly's program at 51%, significantly higher than the 34% of network morning show viewers. The survey shows that changing news formats have not made much difference on how much the public knows about national and international affairs, but adds that there is no clear connection between news formats and what audiences know. The Project for Excellence in Journalism released a <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> report suggesting that The Daily Show comes close to providing the complete daily news.|$|E

Specifically, the time series analysis presented by Wallsten shows evidence of a “Drudge effect” on print and broadcast coverage for only five of the 10 political scandals that received the most attention on the Drudge Report between September 30 and November 3, 2008.|$|E

The trophic level {{is equal to}} one more than the chain length, which {{is the number of}} links connecting to the base. The base of the food chain (primary producers or detritivores) is set at zero.

25|$|Moore's {{connection}} with the poem has been questioned by Professor Donald Foster, who used textual <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> and external evidence to argue that Moore {{could not have been}} the author. Foster believes that Major Henry Livingston, Jr., a New Yorker with Dutch and Scottish roots, should be considered the chief candidate for authorship, a view long espoused by the Livingston family. Livingston was distantly related to Moore's wife. Foster's claim, however, has been countered by document dealer and historian Seth Kaller, who once owned one of Moore's original manuscripts of the poem. Kaller has offered a point-by-point rebuttal of both Foster's linguistic analysis and external findings, buttressed by the work of autograph expert James Lowe and Dr. Joe Nickell, author of Pen, Ink and Evidence.|$|E

His ethnographic study of the advent of political consultants and spot-centered campaigns in the 1996 Japanese national elections were highly supportive of creeping convergence, as was his <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> {{of what he has}} labeled “adentity”. In the latter case, messages of self-identification in Japan, while becoming more locally profuse and variegated, have also become exogenously-homogeneous—insofar as their self-orientation appears more similar to ad messages from the West. Appraising the implications of Holden's grounded theorization, Kenji Kosaka observed that such adentifications reflect a departure from the past, where identity was often mediated by the group. To Kosaka, Holden's study was further evidence that Japanese society had evolved from its original collectivistic values to more individualistic values.|$|E

The presented research examines whether the mathematics textbooks in use in Hungarian primary schools in Romania meet those requirements. We used documentation, <b>contents</b> <b>analysis</b> and surveys as research methods. We examined the mathematics textbooks against requirements in appearance, style and language, editing, approach and contents material. Following <b>contents</b> <b>analysis</b> we can state as a positive result that the textbooks provide {{a great variety of}} problem solving tasks, while meeting the principle of progressivity. Nevertheless, they contain mathematical mistakes, scientific inaccuracies, are not in total agreement with the curriculum and their language is inappropriate. These findings are supported by the results of our survey. The hundred and two teachers asked in the survey gave a medium qualification to the primary school mathematics textbooks. The most often quoted flaws are the lack of differentiated, layered and task based teaching material, as well as the inappropriate language owed to bad translation of the textbooks originally written in Romanian...|$|R

The topic of media influence is currently {{one of the}} very often discussed topics in public. People discuss this influence on children mainly in the negative association with agressivness, violence or negative sexual motivation. Rarely the positive influence as providing information, an opportunity for relaxing or providing amusement in the leisure time is mentioned. The aim of this work was to describe character of the leisure time of children at the age of 11 to 15 and the media influence that children perceive on themselves and on their school-mates and friends as well. There was also the <b>contents</b> <b>analysis</b> of the television broadcast completed that should validate the hypothesis saying that there are violent and sexual scenes shown on television in the time period 14. 00 [...] 22. 00.
