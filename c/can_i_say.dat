Not for nothing have we scored 18 goals against two (both of them freaks) conceded in five ties all away from home. What <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> to do justice to that {{brilliant}} goalkeeper Gil Merrick, to wonderful young Trevor Smith and to the matchless Jeff Hall and Ken Green? Once again they mixed the old cement and constructed that brilliant wall of a defence. Sunderland would have needed to call in a firm of demolition contractors to destroy it.|$|E

Hugo Strange then accuses him of having fabricated a series of events in order to conceal the truth about his condition, as he has read 12 different accounts of his past, all different, except for one detail: Batman. Joker then paraphrases a line from the book: [...] "What <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>say?</b> I like to keep things interesting.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band." [...] The band themselves have regarded it as a [...] "huge turning point" [...] in their career, marking {{a change in the}} way they write and record music, as well as view themselves. In his memoir <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>Say,</b> Barker writes: [...] "It {{had a little bit of}} everything: we ventured far enough outside our genre to make ourselves happy, but not so far that we offended our fan base. It was a perfect happy medium, and it's the Blink album that Mark, Tom, and I are most proud of." ...|$|E
500|$|Box Car Racer was {{conceived}} by Blink-182 guitarist/vocalist Tom DeLonge and formed {{during a break}} from touring. The trio's European tour {{in the winter of}} 2001 was delayed {{in the aftermath of the}} September 11 attacks, and rescheduled dates in early 2002 were also canceled due to DeLonge's back problems, the result of a herniated disc. He began taking painkillers and developed [...] "neurosis-inducing side effects." [...] DeLonge had felt [...] "bummed out" [...] and creatively stifled while recording the group's previous album, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket. On the ensuing tour, he and Blink drummer Travis Barker would jam [...] "every day," [...] and Barker introduced him to post-hardcore music. [...] DeLonge had previously been derisive of any other styles of music, but soon embraced acts like Fugazi, Quicksand, Rocket from the Crypt, and Pitchfork. He began writing heavier-sounding guitar riffs; the first riff he created became part of the song [...] "All Systems Go". Barker, in his 2015 memoir <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>Say,</b> maintains that he asked DeLonge if they should use the riffs for a new Blink album. [...] "I honestly thought that Tom had already had a conversation with [...] about this. They were so tight—inseparable—I couldn't imagine Mark didn't know," [...] Barker writes.|$|E
500|$|The {{reunion of}} the band has been {{characterized}} as dysfunctional by both Barker and DeLonge. Hoppus commented on this era {{of the band}} in a later interview: [...] "Everything was always very contentious. There was always just a strange vibe. [...] I {{knew there was something}} wrong." [...] In his memoir, <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>Say,</b> Barker claims DeLonge's behavior on tour was [...] "introverted" [...] until [...] "money started coming in," [...] after which [...] "he'd get excited about Blink." [...] He states DeLonge abruptly quit sometime in mid-2014, and rejoined the following day. The group planned to begin writing their seventh album in January 2015, which had continually seen delays. [...] "I'd do interviews and I just felt awful for fans because they were promised albums for years and we couldn't do it," [...] Barker later said. A record deal was finalized and sessions were booked before DeLonge's manager informed the band he intended to spend more time on [...] "non-musical activities" [...] and indefinitely depart the group. In his own statement, DeLonge remarked that he [...] "Never planned on quitting, just find it hard as hell to commit." [...] After these events, Barker summarized the band's reunion: [...] "Why Blink even got back together in the first place is questionable." ...|$|E

500|$|The Broadway {{production}} {{opened on}} October 30, 2003, to mixed to positive reviews from theatre critics. Menzel and Chenoweth received nearly unanimous praise for their performances as Elphaba and Glinda. Both USA Today and Time Magazine gave the Broadway production of Wicked very positive reviews, with Richard Zoglin of Time saying, [...] "If every musical had a brain, a {{heart and the}} courage of Wicked, Broadway really would be a magical place." [...] Elysa Gardner of USA Today described it as [...] "the most complete, and completely satisfying, new musical I've come across in a long time." [...] Conversely, Ben Brantley in the New York Times loved the production but panned the show itself, calling it a [...] "sermon" [...] that [...] "so overplays its hand that it seriously dilutes its power," [...] with a [...] "generic" [...] score. He noted that Glinda is such a showy role that the audience ends up rooting for her rather than the [...] "surprisingly colorless" [...] Elphaba, who is [...] "nominally" [...] the hero. Despite these mixed reviews, interest in Wicked spread quickly by word-of-mouth, leading to record-breaking success at the box office, as described below. Speaking to The Arizona Republic in 2006, Schwartz commented, [...] "What <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>say?</b> Reviews are reviews.... I know we divided the critics. We didn't divide the audience, and that's what counts." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to some contradicting sources, {{the title}} of the album (or lack thereof) is debated. Travis Barker, in his memoir <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>Say,</b> writes that [...] "Some people think it's a {{untitled}} album, called Blink-182, but Mark [...] has always insisted it was actually untitled." [...] A 2003 interview and article from MTV News discussing the naming of the pending album repeatedly refers to the release as the [...] "untitled album," [...] while a press release from that time period confirms the same. Despite this, several critics have used the terms [...] "eponymous", [...] "untitled", and [...] "self-titled" [...] in describing the album. In a 2009 MTV News article, James Montgomery refers to the album as self-titled, joking, [...] "Or untitled … It's never really been clear." [...] The title for the album was originally rumored to be Use Your Erection I & II, a parody of the Guns N' Roses albums Use Your Illusion I and II, but was revealed to be a joke Barker made to [...] "get a rise out of people." [...] DeLonge, in reference to previous joke album titles (such as Enema of the State), stated, [...] "We didn't want to label it with a joke title that people might expect." [...] As such, a Billboard article from the week of the album's release lists three rejected joke titles: Diarrhea de Janeiro, Vasectomy, Vasect-a-you and [...] "Our Pet Sounds".|$|E
500|$|At {{the heart}} of this scene is Cable's song [...] "You've Got to Be Carefully Taught", in which Cable realizes the sources of his own racism. [...] Its frank lyrics made it perhaps the most {{controversial}} element of the show. Michener recalled in his memoirs that a delegation of New Englanders had approached him after a New Haven tryout and urged him to recommend the song's removal to Rodgers and Hammerstein. [...] When Michener told Hammerstein, he laughed and replied, [...] "That's what the show is about!" [...] Boston drama critic Elliot Norton, after seeing the show in tryouts, strongly recommended its removal, or at least that Cable sing it less [...] "briskly", as there was much bigotry in Boston; Logan replied that that was all the more reason for leaving it unaltered. Several New York reviewers expressed discomfort with the song; Wolcott Gibbs wrote of [...] "something called 'You've Got to Be Taught', a poem in praise of tolerance that somehow I found a little embarrassing" [...] while John Mason Brown opined that he was [...] "somewhat distressed by the dragged-in didacticism of such a plea for tolerance as 'You've Got to Be Taught'". After the Broadway opening, Hammerstein received a large number of letters concerning [...] "You've Got to Be Carefully Taught". [...] Judging by the letters that remain among his papers in the Library of Congress, the reaction was mixed. One correspondent wrote [...] "What <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> to a man who writes, 'You've got to be taught to hate and fear?'... Now that I know you, I feel that my informants didn't praise you enough." [...] Nevertheless, another wrote, [...] "I feel the inclusion of the song particularly in the album and to some extent in the show itself is not helpful to the cause of brotherhood, your intent to the contrary notwithstanding".|$|E
