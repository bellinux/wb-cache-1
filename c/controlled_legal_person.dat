We focus on two very different industries: the manufacturing industry [...] the largest (relatively) competitive industry in China [...] and the basic material industry [...] the largest industry protected and closely monitored by the central government. We find that privatization to the domestic public has only a small positive effect on corporate performance for the manufacturing industry, but {{does not have any}} effect for the basic material industry, suggesting that privatization does not work when competition does not prevail. We also find that privatization to institutions hurts corporate performance for the manufacturing industry, but not for the basic material industry, suggesting that <b>control</b> by <b>legal</b> <b>person</b> shares often means additional layers of bureaucracy and higher agency costs, unless the central government closely monitors the firms, mitigating the agency problems. ...|$|R
40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{examined}} the relationship between gender diversity on the board and firm performance for developed countries, but similar efforts for developing countries are rare. Employing a panel of over 1, 000 listed firms for a period from 1999 to 2007, this study assesses the impact of women directors on the performance of listed firms in China. Our main results suggest that: 1) The percent of women directors has a positive impact on firm performance as measured by return on sales (ROS) or return on assets (ROA), 2) The number of women directors matters: A board with three or more women directors has a much stronger impact on firm performance than a board with one or two women directors, 3) The positive impact of women directors on firm performance is significant among firms <b>controlled</b> by <b>legal</b> <b>person</b> owners but not significant among firms controlled by state owners. This result corroborates the view that <b>legal</b> <b>person</b> owners tend to monitor the listed firms in China more effectively than state owners (Chen, Firth, Gao and Rui, 2006, Sun and Tong, 2003). In sum, this study indicates that in China, women directors {{have a positive impact on}} firm performance, contingent on the ownership structure of listed firms...|$|R
40|$|In Chapter 1, we {{investigate}} the shareholder and creditor protection {{and look into}} the dividend policy implement in the stock market. The investor protection was analyzed based on the China company law and our result shows that the shareholder (creditor) protection is weak (strong) compared {{with the rest of}} the world. In China, a firm can issue as many as five different classes of shares: state shares, <b>legal</b> <b>person</b> shares, A-shares, foreign shares and employee shares. Under the weak shareholder protection in China, A-shareholders are categorized to the disadvantage group in corporate structure which demonstrates the classic free-rider problem. With the expertise and knowledge to monitor the management, <b>controlling</b> <b>legal</b> <b>person</b> not only enhance the corporate performance, but also expecting dividend payout as the reward. In our study, we have strong evidence on the <b>legal</b> <b>person</b> share ownership positively related to the dividend payout decision, while the A-shares and state shares ownership are negatively related to the decision on dividend payout. The Japanese stock market provide a reasonable setting for studying intermediate-horizon price momentum effect, because Japan has the largest equity market aside from the U. S. in terms of both capitalization and number of securities. In Chapter 2, by measuring the relative strength of portfolio on the Japanese market, we found that the price momentum does not exist in the Japanese market. Further, the momentum returns keep always negative on any horizon, which is coherent in keiretsu and non-keiretsu grouping and in different trading volume. The decomposition on the expected average returns of different investment period in Japanese market shows that the price reversals is not capable to overwhelm the losses from the cross-sectional differences in mean returns and cannot yield statistically significant net momentum profits in the Japanese market. This paper consists of two separate projects: (1) The investor protection and dividend policy in China, (2) Price momentum in Japan. Wong Chin Pang, Antonio. "April 2003. "Adviser: Jia He.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine whether the {{ownership}} structure affects the corporate performance of publicly listed companies in China within the framework of corporate governance. I will use a sample of 37 manufacturing firms and 35 retailing companies in the Chinese stock exchanges. Two tests are carried out to exam whether the relationships are positive or negative. One test is the regression analysis of the relationship between ownership concentration variables and corporate performance. The next test is the regression analysis of the relationship between different types of ownership variables and corporate performance. The corporate performance is measured by Tobin's Q. The ownership concentration variables are the fraction of the largest shareholdings (T 1) and the fraction of the top 10 shareholdings (T 10). The different types of ownership variables include the fraction of state agencies, state wholly <b>controlled</b> institutions, domestic <b>legal</b> <b>persons,</b> top management and tradable shares. Other control variables are also taken into account, such as ages of companies listed on the stock exchanges, the size of firms and etc. In this study, I will compare my findings in manufacturing industry with Chen's (2001).
