40|$|In {{order to}} sustain human {{life in an}} {{isolated}} environment, an efficient conversion of wasted nutrients to food might become mandatory. This is particularly the case for space missions where resupply from earth or in-situ resource utilization is not possible or desirable. A combination of different technologies is needed to allow full recycling of e. g. nitrogenous compounds in space. In this review, an overview is given of the different essential processes and technologies that enable closure of the nitrogen cycle in Bioregenerative Life Support Systems (BLSS). Firstly, a set of biological and physicochemical refinery stages ensures efficient <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> <b>products</b> into the building blocks, followed by the production of food {{with a range of}} biological methods. For each technology, bottlenecks are identified. Furthermore, challenges and outlooks are presented at the integrated system level. Space adaptation and integration deserve key attention to enable the recovery of nitrogen for the production of nutritional food in space, but also in closed loop systems on earth...|$|E
30|$|The present {{investigation}} describes the <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> <b>product</b> into effective adsorbent and its application {{for the treatment}} of wastewater, i.e., chemically modified solid waste from paper industry has been tested for its adsorption ability for the successful removal of Rhodamine B dye from its aqueous solution. The adsorption isotherm, kinetics and thermodynamic parameters of process have been determined by monitoring the different parameters, such as effect of pH, amount of adsorbent dose, concentration, contact time and temperature. The equilibrium data has been well described on the basis of various adsorption isotherms, namely Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin adsorption isotherm. From Langmuir isotherm, the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity {{has been found to be}} 6.711  mg g− 1 at 308  K temperature. The kinetics of adsorption has been studied using pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order and intra-particle diffusion model and the results show that kinetics has been well described by pseudo-second order. Thermodynamic parameters, such as free energy change (ΔG), enthalpy change (ΔH) and entropy change (ΔS), have been evaluated. The free energy has been obtained as − 11.9452  kJ mol− 1 for 75  mg L− 1 concentration at 308  K temperature. Desorption and recycling efficiency of adsorbent has been studied and the adsorbent shows good recycling efficiency.|$|R
40|$|Many {{by-products}} of {{our economy}} are considered ""waste"" and are disposed of as landfill or by incineration. A shortage of landfill sites and increasingly higher fuel prices have stimulated interests in the <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> burnable <b>waste</b> <b>products</b> into heat for process and the generation of power. Interest in the combustion {{of the most widely}} distributed <b>waste</b> <b>products,</b> household and industrial municipal refuse, is rapidly escalating. The assembly of a large complex for power and steam production by the combustion of municipal refuse, however, is a very complex process requiring the cooperation of many governmental, private, industrial, environmental and financial entities. A number of refuse burning plants have been and are being built. Many projects are in the planning stage. This paper reviews the background available in the combustion for steam generation of municipal refuse in shredded form on spreader stokers. This paper also provides up-to-date information regarding the design, construction, and operational status of the two large steam generating units for the combustion of municipal refuse presently being completed at the Hooker Chemical installation in Niagara Falls, New York. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{two-level}} filter system {{to evaluate the}} potential for alternative waste management practices by <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> locally-generated <b>waste</b> <b>products</b> such as animal mortality, manure, and wood <b>waste</b> into beneficial <b>products</b> such as energy in Tillamook county of Oregon. At the first level - coarse grained filter, three basic factors, technical readiness level (TRL), scaling capacity, and feedstock, are used to initially filter out the scanned technologies which can be potentially used in waste management. At the secondary level filter - fine grained filter, a numeric scoring model is created to evaluate technologies from {{the output of the}} first level filter. Since many factors will impact the selection of a technology, HDM (Hierarchical decision model) is used to score technologies. From technical, economic, social, and environmental perspectives, hierarchical multi-criteria factor structure is created, and constant-sum and pair-wise comparison are used to subjectively create the priority probability list about technologies. Composting technology, rendering technology, and hydrolysis are analyzed in detail. This developed alternative strategy will help to mitigate local liabilities, promote green jobs, develop clean energy, and reduce the carbon footprint in Tillamook County...|$|R
30|$|India is {{the largest}} {{consumer}} and second largest producer of sugar in the world after Brazil. The sugar industry is the second largest agro-processing industries in India next to textiles industry with total sugar production of about 283 lakhs tonnes from 538 sugar factories during 2015 – 2016. The pressmud and molasses are the important by products of sugar industries, and the production is {{to the tune of}} 8.7 and 8.5 million tonnes per annum, respectively (National Federation of Co-operative Sugar Factories Ltd 2016; Dotaniya et al. 2016). The production of pressmud cake amounts to about 3  % of cane crushed in the sugar factory. Pressmud is the compressed sugar industry waste produced from the filtration of the cane juice. Molasses is utilized in the distillery for the production of alcohol. The distilleries release a huge quantity of spent wash. These waste products cause disposal and pollution problems. Pressmud cake (PMC) is one such source of organic matter and nutrients (rich in potassium and phosphorus) which can be profitably utilized for crop production. PMC like other organic manures has great potential to supply nutrients in addition to its favourable effects on physico-chemical and biological properties of soil. The value of pressmud as an organic manure has been well recognized for utilizing in agriculture, as it contains valuable plant nutrients in organic form besides being a very effective soil ameliorant (Singh et al. 2015 a, b). Rice is the stable food crop in India with world ranking one in area (42.6  Mha) and second to China in production (104.80  Mt) during 2014 – 15. India needs to produce about 325  million tonnes of food grains to feed an expected population of about 1.5  billion by 2025 (Swaminathan and Bhavani 2013). Keeping in view of the average annual population growth rate of 1.5  % and per capita consumption estimate of about 400  g of rice per day, demand of rice is expected to be around 140  Mt by 2025 (Singh et al. 2015 a, b). As the pressmud and distillery effluents contain plant nutrients, these could be converted into nutrient-rich organic manure. <b>Conversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> <b>products</b> into rich organic manures not only solves the problems of disposal and pollution, but also replenishes the soils and reduces the fertilizer cost (Selvamurugan et al. 2013). Although substantial work has been done on the utilization of raw pressmud in rice cultivation, the effect due to composting and enrichment of pressmud on nutrient availability, growth, yield parameters, yield and efficiency parameters of rice is very much limited. Hence a study was made to know the effect of enriched pressmud compost on growth, yield parameters and yield of rice.|$|E

The improvement of lactic acid production from glucose by solid catalyst such as feldspar was investigated. Nowadays, the <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> into high-value <b>products</b> or particularly fuels has attracted considerable attention. In all high-value products, lactic acid is the main target product in this study because lactic acid is a commodity chemical. The lactic acid yield from this study are 12. 37 % and 10. 84 % when using Albite and Potassium feldspar respectively. The catalytic activity of Albite before and after experiments didn’t change but Potassium feldspar has changed in the first one.
