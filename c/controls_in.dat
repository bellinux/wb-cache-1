40|$|At {{present the}} problem of {{internal}} <b>control</b> <b>in</b> budgetary institutions is being studied by {{a large number of}} scientists, but as the data analysis demonstrated, they are purely theoretical. At the same time, the need for practical guidance of internal <b>control</b> <b>in</b> the public sector stipulates the development and justification of scientific and methodological aspects of the organization's internal control. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to develop and support scientific and methodical approach of internal <b>control</b> <b>in</b> budgetary institutions. In order to achieve this goal in the following article scientific and practical problems were solved: the necessity of internal <b>control</b> <b>in</b> the public sector, general structure of internal control, stages of internal <b>control</b> <b>in</b> budgetary institutions, a model of internal <b>control</b> <b>in</b> the public sector institutions as a sequence of three separate blocks: the preparatory, organizational and diagnostic, the content of each unit of the proposed model is detailed. It is proved that the key to the model of internal <b>control</b> <b>in</b> budgetary institutions is the principle of efficiency and economy. The model of internal <b>control</b> <b>in</b> the public institutions includes the stages of an organization's internal control, principles of organization, organizational support, which in turn is divided into regulatory, metho­dological, human, technical, informational, material. The content developed model of internal <b>control</b> <b>in</b> budgetary institutions is reflected in a generalized methodological approach to the organization of internal <b>control</b> <b>in</b> the public sector. The proposed scientific and methodical approach is versatile and can be used for the organization of internal <b>control</b> <b>in</b> the public institution within the Concept of the Public Internal Financial Control Development to enhance legitimacy and effectiveness of the public institution. Scientific novelty of the results of this study is developing and substantiating scientific and methodological approach to internal <b>control</b> <b>in</b> budgetary institutions by developing a model of such an organization. However, the need to develop a model taking into account the human factor in the formation of internal <b>control</b> <b>in</b> public institutions should be defined as the direction of future research...|$|R

Despite the failure to control inflation, controls were slowly ended, and on April 30, 1974, their statutory authorization lapsed.|$|E

40|$|The learned {{helplessness}} theory asserts that depressed individuals unrealistically {{believe that they}} have little to no control over aversive outcomes in their lives. Paradoxically, research on judgment of control has demonstrated that depressed individuals are not necessarily pessimistic, but rather more realistic than non-depressed individuals. Most of the research on depressive realism has investigated individual’s perceived <b>control</b> <b>in</b> situations in which they have no actual control. Few studies have investigated perception of <b>control</b> <b>in</b> situations where <b>control</b> is possible. Considering that many circumstances in life are controllable, it is important to examine how different personality variables contribute to accurate judgments of <b>control</b> <b>in</b> controllable situations. In addition, many studies have found a negative correlation between optimism and depression and the positive correlation between depression and pessimism, yet the research on control lacks information on optimistic and pessimistic individuals’ perception of control. Using a computerized judgment of control task, the current study examined perception of <b>control</b> <b>in</b> both no-control and control situations among participants classified as either optimistic or pessimistic and as dysphoric or non-dysphoric. Measures of optimism and pessimism used in this study were the Attributional Style Questionnaire and the Life Orientation Test-Revised and the Beck Depression Inventory-II was used to assess depressogenic symptoms. Participants were 88 undergraduate students. It was hypothesized that optimistic participants would exhibit illusory <b>control</b> <b>in</b> both contingent and non-contingent situations, while the pessimistic participants would provide accurate judgments of <b>control</b> <b>in</b> the no-control situation and underestimate <b>control</b> <b>in</b> the iv <b>control</b> situations. Additionally, it was hypothesized that dysphoric participants would provide accurate <b>control</b> judgments <b>in</b> the no-control situation and underestimate <b>control</b> <b>in</b> the <b>control</b> conditions. The results provided mixed support for the study’s hypotheses. Participants with optimistic explanatory styles provided accurate <b>control</b> judgments <b>in</b> the high contingency task and overestimated <b>control</b> <b>in</b> noncontingent and low contingent tasks. Participants with pessimistic explanatory styles underestimated <b>control</b> <b>in</b> the high contingency task and overestimated in noncontingent and low contingent tasks. Contrary to the depressive realism hypothesis, dysphoric participants did not provide accurate judgments of control regardless of the contingency situation. Dysphoric participants underestimated <b>control</b> <b>in</b> the high contingency situation and overestimated <b>control</b> <b>in</b> noncontingent and low contingent tasks.
