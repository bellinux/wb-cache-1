40|$|Designing {{efficient}} and facile recoverable catalysts is desired for sustainable biomass valorization. This work reports the one-pot synthesis {{of a novel}} magnetic Fe(NiFe) O- 4 -SiO 2 nanocatalyst for hydrogenation of biomass-derived furfural into valuable furfuryl alcohol. Various techniques were used to systematically analyze the physicochemical properties of the Fe(NiFe) O- 4 -SiO 2 nanocatalyst. Vibrating sample magnetometer analysis reveals low coercivity of Fe(NiFe) O- 4 -SiO 2 (6. 991 G) {{compared with that of}} Fe 3 O 4 -SiO 2 (27. 323 G), which is attributed to highly dispersed Ni species in the Fe(NiFe) O- 4 -SiO 2 catalyst. HRTEM images indicated the nanosized nature of the Fe(NiFe) O- 4 -SiO 2 catalyst with an average diameter of similar to 44. 32 nm. The Fe(NiFe) O- 4 -SiO 2 <b>catalyst</b> <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> superior <b>BET</b> surface area (259 m(2) /g), which is due to the formation of nanosized particles. The magnetic Fe(NiFe) O- 4 -SiO 2 nanocatalyst <b>shows</b> <b>a</b> remarkable performance with 94. 3 and 93. 5 % conversions of furfural and similar to 100 % selectivity of furfuryl alcohol at 90 degrees C and 20 H- 2 bar and 250 degrees C and 5 H 2 bar, respectively. Using heptane as a solvent, the effect of temperature, pressure, reactant amount, and catalyst loading were investigated to optimize the reaction conditions. A probable mechanism via a non -hydrogen spillover route was proposed for the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol over the magnetic Fe(NiFe) O- 4 -SiO 2 nanocatalyst. The efficiency of the magnetic Fe(NiFe) O- 4 -SiO 2 nanocatalyst is attributed to highly dispersed nickel species, which {{plays a key role in}} the dissociation of H 2 into a proton and a hydride in the furfural hydrogenation. The superior performance of the magnetic Fe(NiFe) O- 4 -SiO 2 nanocatalyst, along with the advantages of low cost and easy recoverability, could make it a new appealing catalyst in various selective hydrogenation reactions...|$|R
