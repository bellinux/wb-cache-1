40|$|We {{have shown}} that the descent of the {{nanocrystal}} symmetry from spherical to point group Cs, which is characterized by just one mirror plane symmetry element, leads step by step to activation of all five F = 2, Fz= 2, 1, 0 excitons. Even the ground exciton becomes optically active, which should be observable in low-temperature photoluminescence measurements. For several intermediate symmetries the band edge exciton fine structure consists of sets of three linearly polarized mutually orthogonal dipoles plus a dark exciton, one of which is always the ground state. We quantify the effect of symmetry descent on the exciton fine structure by introducing a charged Coulomb impurity in the nanocrystals. The calculations show that the nanocrystal symmetry breaking by a Coulomb impurity, particularly a positively charged <b>center,</b> <b>shortens</b> the radiative decay of nanocrystals even at room temperatures in qualitative agreement with the increase in PL efficiency observed in nanocrystals doped with positive Ag charge centers...|$|R

40|$|Maritime domain {{awareness}} (MDA) entails {{knowing what}} is happening in the oceans and waterways that could affect the security or environment of the United States. With a focus on potential attack vessels (PAV) as threats in the maritime domain, a multi-domain SoS is needed to exploit and integrate information from multiple sources, including sensors, databases, and intelligence, to provide reconnaissance, surveillance, and information used in the formulation of a common operational picture (COP), a tool to effect maritime domain awareness. In this thesis the best architecture of net-centric operations (NCO) multidomain system of systems (SoS) for MDA is determined, employing an integrated systems engineering methodology for analyzing and ranking systems of systems architectures. This methodology involves the use of process modeling, modeling of an SoS with the systems modeling language (SysML), and subsequent conversion of the resulting SysML diagrams into an ExtendTM executable simulation model, used in a simulative study carried out to evaluate three multi-domain awareness SoS architecture alternatives in terms of the time to establish a COP and the probability of COP accuracy. Of the three architecture alternatives, a conceptual SoS whose constituting systems are connected in a distributed network with a high degree of connectivity is found to take the least amount of time to establish a COP and to have a high probability of COP accuracy. It can thus be considered to be the best of the three MDA SoS architecture alternatives. The results indicate that, in a distributed network, which is the backbone of net-centric operations, direct links between the sensors and the coalition C 2 <b>center</b> <b>shorten</b> the communications delay and hence reduce the time to establish a COP. The accuracy of the information to be combined at the coalition C 2 center is necessary for having a high probability of COP accuracy. Furthermore, the integrated systems engineering methodology for analyzing SoS architectures provides an effective framework and tool for designing and analyzing complex SoS in general and NCO MDA SoS in particular.

40|$|The strict {{divisions}} of city spaces created by physical urban planning disintegrated under transformations {{of capitalism and}} its accompanying crises of overaccumulation, social urban planning was elaborated to more effectively control the capitalist city and to reintegrate the increasingly blighted areas of the once popular amusements into the economy. This disciplined reintegration, unsuccessfully attempted in New York City's Times Square since the late 1920 s. is finally being realized by the redevelopment forces that began shaping the city's spatial practices {{in the wake of}} the fiscal crisis of 1975. The development projects undertaken in midtown Manhattan following the recovery from the fiscal crisis are transforming the renowned Times Square theater district into a strikingly different urban environment. The new politics of redevelopment under the regime of flexible accumulation are almost exclusively oriented towards economic development that is equated with speculative property investments, rebuilding Times Square to promote the global city's finance monopoly.

Narrow-bandgap InAs/GaSb type-II superlattices (T 2 SLs) have shown great promise as next generation materials, due to superior intrinsic properties and versatility. Unfortunately, InAs/GaSb T 2 SLs are plagued by parasitic Shockley-Read-Hall recombination <b>centers</b> that <b>shorten</b> the carrier lifetime and limit device performance.

Measurements of unintentionally doped MWIR and LWIR InAs/InAs₁₋xSbx T 2 SLs demonstrate minority carrier (MC) lifetimes of 18. 4 µs and 4. 5 µs at 77 K, respectively. This represents a more than two order of magnitude increase compared to the 90 ns MC lifetime measured in a comparable MWIR and LWIR InAs/GaSb T 2 SL. Through temperature-dependent differential-transmission measurements, the various carrier recombination processes are differentiated and the dominant recombination mechanisms identified for InAs/InAs₁₋xSbx T 2 SLs.

In this paper, the rider upper body lean control system is considered as the only control action to analyze and simulate the stability and the perception of riding comfort of the rider-motorcycle system in different riding conditions and parameter designs. The equations of lateral motion of an electrical motorcycle, which includes the rider upper body leaning motion, are derived first from Newton mechanics. Via this dynamics model and its associated transfer functions at various speeds, perception of riding comfort is defined as the damping ratio of frequency domain Bode plots in classical control theory. By the analysis, we find that the tendency of the stability is the same under the straight-line and the cornering motions, but shows significant differences for different parameter designs of the electrical motorcycle. We discuss the effect on the perception of riding comfort issue for changing mass center position, total weight of the motorcycle, the wheelbase, the front fork rake angle and the front wheel trail distance of the motorcycle. On the premise of the stability, we use the maximum damping ratio to represent the riding response of the motorcycle to find the best perception of riding comfort. By the analysis results, if we move the mass <b>center</b> forward, <b>shorten</b> the wheelbase, steepen the front fork rake angle and shorten the front wheel trail distance of the current design of electrical motorcycles in the market, a better perception of riding comfort is achieved.

A well-planned region strives to be a “community of short distances. ” A wide range of housing choices located close to employment <b>centers</b> could <b>shorten</b> commuting distances and substantially reduce government outlays for transportation facilities, reduce household transportation expenses, and increase feasibility of pedestrian movement. These needs are particularly important to families earning modest wages. CURA, with support from The Community Foundation Serving Richmond and Central Virginia and the Richmond Association of Realtors, has analyzed the spatial pattern of lower-wage jobs and lower-cost housing within the Richmond Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). The analysis reveals how low-cost housing and modest-wage jobs in the Richmond region are not well-balanced. Few areas in which modest-wage jobs cluster have comparable levels of low-cost housing. The established suburban areas north, west, and south of Richmond’s urban center have a large number of retail and service jobs that pay modest wages, yet these areas provide few affordable-dwelling units for these wage earners. The second part of this study addressed a major obstacle to the construction of new, affordable-housing units: fears. Many new, affordable dwelling units, by financial necessity, will be built at higher densities and smaller size to reduce cost. Homeowners in nearby neighborhoods often oppose construction of these units over fear of reduced property values, higher crime, and other factors. Six higher-density, 3 lower-cost housing projects were studied for their impact on the nearby middle-income neighborhoods.

Methods 　Referring to the international association of chest pain centers, the chest pain center was established in the hospital the authors served, and the corresponding management system and treatment process were worked out. A total of 576 patients with acute STEMI, admitted after the establishment of the chest pain center (May 2015 Mar. 2016), were recruited as the observation group, and 512 STEMI patients admitted before the establishment of the chest pain center (Jan. -Dec. 2014) were enrolled as control group. Patients in observation group were treated in the chest pain center, and those in control group received conventional treatment. The general situation, basic diseases, the finishing time of the first ECG and the completed number of ECG within 10 minutes, the success rate of stent implantation in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), the time of door-to balloon expansion (D 2 B), the length of hospital stay and in-hospital mortality were compared between the two groups. Results 　No significant difference existed between the two groups in the species composition of diseases, age and sex. The average finishing time of the first ECG was shorter in observation group than in control group (P= 0. 001), the success rate of stent implantation in PCI was higher in observation group than in control group, but without statistical significance (P= 0. 222). The time of D 2 B and of hospital stay was shorter in observation group than in control group (P 0. 05).

Measurements at 77 K provided minority carrier lifetimes of 9 μs and 3 μs for an unintentionally doped mid-wave infrared (MWIR) InAs/InAsSb T 2 SL and InAsSb alloy, respectively; a two order of magnitude increase compared to the 90 ns minority carrier lifetime measured in a comparable MWIR InAs/GaSb T 2 SL. Through temperature-dependent lifetime measurements, the various carrier recombination processes are differentiated and the dominant mechanisms identified for each material. These results demonstrate that these Ga-free materials are viable options over InAs/GaSb T 2 SLs for potentially improved infrared photodetectors. In addition to carrier lifetimes, the drift and diffusion of excited charge carriers through the superlattice growth layers (i. e. vertical transport) directly affects the performance of photodetectors and emitters. Unfortunately, {{there is a lack of}} information pertaining to vertical transport, primarily due to difficulties in making measurements on thin growth layers and the need for non-standard {{measurement techniques}}. However, all-optical ultrafast techniques are successfully used here to directly measure vertical diffusion in MWIR InAs/GaSb T 2 SLs. By optically generating excess carriers near one end of a MWIR T 2 SL and measuring the transit time to a thin, 2 lower-bandgap superlattice placed at the other end, the time-of-flight of vertically diffusing carriers is determined. Through investigation of both unintentionally doped and p-type superlattices at 77 K, the vertical hole and electron diffusion coefficients are determined to be 0. 04 ± 0. 03 cm 2 /s and 4. 7 ± 0. 5 cm 2 /s, corresponding to vertical mobilities of 6 ± 5 cm 2 /Vs and 700 ± 80 cm 2 /Vs, respectively. These measurements are, to my knowledge, the first direct measurements of vertical transport properties in narrow-bandgap superlattices. Lastly, the widely tunable two-color ultrafast laser system used in this research allowed for the investigation of nonlinear optical properties in narrow-bandgap semiconductors. Time-resolved measurements taken at 77 K of the nondegenerate two-photon absorption spectrum of bulk n-type GaSb have provided new information about the nonresonant change in absorption and two-photon absorption coefficients in this material. Furthermore, as the nondegenerate spectrum was measured over a wide range of optical frequencies, a Kramers-Kronig transformation allowed the dispersion of the nondegenerate nonlinear refractive index to be calculated...|$|R
40|$|In multiagent systems, {{computational}} agents {{search for}} and make contracts {{on behalf of}} the real world parties that they represent. This dissertation analyses negotiations among agents that try to maximize payoff without concern of the global good. Such a self-interested agent will choose the best negotiation strategy for itself. Accordingly, the interaction protocols need to be designed normatively so that the desired local strategies are best for the agents [...] and thus the agents will use them [...] then certain desirable social outcomes follow. The normative approach allows the agents to be constructed by separate designers and/or to represent different parties. Game theory also takes a normative approach, but full rationality of the agents is usually assumed. This dissertation focuses on situations where computational limitations restrict each agent 2 ̆ 7 s rationality: in combinatorial negotiation domains computational complexity precludes enumerating and evaluating all possible outcomes. The dissertation contributes to: automated contracting, coalition formation, and contract execution. ^ The contract net framework is extended to work among self-interested, computationally limited agents. The original contract net lacked a formal model for making bidding and awarding decisions, while in this work these decisions are based on marginal approximations of cost calculations. Agents pay each other for handling tasks. An iterative scheme for anytime task reallocation is presented. Next it is proven that a leveled commitment contracting protocol enables contracts that are impossible via classical full commitment contracts. Three new contract types are presented: clustering, swaps and multiagent contracts. These can be combined into a new type, CSM-contract, which is provably necessary and sufficient for reaching a globally optimal task allocation. Next, contracting implications of limited computation are discussed, including the necessity of local deliberation scheduling, and tradeoffs between computational complexity and monetary risk when an agent can participate in multiple simultaneous negotiations. Finally, issues in distributed asynchronous implementation are discussed. ^ A normative theory of coalitions among self-interested, computationally limited agents is developed. It states which agents should form coalitions and which coalition structures are stable. These analytical prescriptions depend on the performance profiles of the agents 2 ̆ 7 problem solving algorithms and the unit cost of computation. The prescriptions differ significantly from those for fully rational agents. The developed theory includes a formal application independent domain classification for bounded rational agents, and relates it precisely to two traditional domain classifications of fully rational agents. Experimental results are presented. ^ Unenforced exchange methods are particularly desirable among computational agents because litigation is difficult. A method for carrying out exchanges without enforcement is presented. It is based on splitting the exchange into chunks that are delivered one at a time. Two chunking algorithms are developed, as well as a nontrivial sound and complete quadratic chunk sequencing algorithm. Optimal stable strategies for carrying out the exchange are derived. The role of real-time is also analyzed, and deadline methods are developed that do not themselves require enforcement. All of these analyses are carried out for isolated exchanges as well as for exchanges where reputation effects prevail. Finally, it is argued that the unenforced exchange method hinders unfair renegotiation. ^ The developed methods in all three subareas are domain independent. The possibility of scaling to large problem instances was shown experimentally on an NP-complete distributed vehicle routing problem. The large-scale problem instance was collected from five real-world dispatch <b>centers.</b> (Abstract <b>shortened</b> by UMI.) ...|$|R
