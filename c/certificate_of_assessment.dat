40|$|In Ralph Lauren 57 Pty Ltd v Conley [2016] QSC 149 {{the court}} gave a {{direction}} requiring the costs assessor to file his <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>assessment.</b> The judgment considered {{a number of}} rules in Part 3 of Chapter 17 A of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 1999 (Qld) relating to the assessment of costs other than under the Legal Profession Act 2007 (Qld). Some observations {{were made in the}} judgment about the time when a costs assessment is completed. The question of when a costs assessment is completed will determine whether interest is payable on those costs under s 59 of the Civil Proceedings Act 2011 (Qld). The article suggests that current practice in relation to the time from which most practitioners seek interest on unpaid costs may not be consistent with the now substantive law on the issue...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the {{primary health care}} information system from the general practitioner's (GP) point of view. [...] - METHODS: Sixty-seven Croatian GPs were distributed a questionnaire about characteristics of the GP's office, overall impression of the application, handling of daily routine information, more sophisticated information needs, and data security, and rated their satisfaction with each component from 1 to 5. We also compared two most frequently used applications [...] application with distantly installed software (DIS) and that with locally installed software (LIS, personal computer-based application). [...] - RESULTS: GPs were most satisfied with the daily procedures and the reminder component of the health information system (rating 4. 1). The overall impression ranked second (3. 5) and flexibility of applications followed closely (3. 4). The most questionable aspect of applications was data security (3. 0). LIS system received better overall rate than DIS (4. 2 vs 3. 2). [...] - CONCLUSION: Applications received better ratings for daily routine use than for overall impression and ability to get specific information according the GPs' needs. Poor ratings on the capability of the application, complaints about unreliable links, and doubts about data security point to {{a need for more}} user-friendly interfaces, more information on the capability of the application, and a valid <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>assessment</b> for every application...|$|E

40|$|Several U. S. states enforce <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> Need (CON) regulations, which {{limit the}} number of {{hospitals}} performing open heart surgery or coronary angioplasty. CON regulations were intended to restrain cost growth and improve quality of care. This study compares mortality rates and costs for cardiac care in states with and without CON. CON appears to raise hospital procedure volume and lower the average cost of care. However, CON is associated with little reduction in inpatient mortality, and it may lead hospitals to operate on more patients than they would otherwise. The claimed welfare benefits of CON regulations require careful reconsideration.
