50|$|A dropped {{ceiling is}} a {{secondary}} ceiling, hung below the main (structural) ceiling. It {{may also be}} referred to as a drop ceiling, T-bar ceiling, false ceiling, suspended ceiling, grid <b>ceiling,</b> <b>drop</b> in <b>ceiling,</b> <b>drop</b> out ceiling, or ceiling tiles and is a staple of modern construction and architecture in both residential and commercial applications.|$|E
5000|$|Barney sings {{two songs}} (If You're Happy and You Know It/Imagine a Place) before Baby Bop and BJ make their appearances. Soon after that, They sing [...] "Mr. Knickerbocker" [...] "Down on Grandpa's Farm" [...] and [...] "If All the Raindrops". During the latter song, air {{fans in the}} <b>ceiling</b> <b>drop</b> mist and streams {{of water on the}} audience, and small pieces of what is {{imagined}} to be snow (soap flakes) on the crowd. After the song, Barney mentions how he has had a wonderful time with all of the guests, and says that only one song is left to finish off the day. The characters hold hands, and wrap the show the way they do on the television series with the song [...] "I Love You". Baby Bop and B.J. make their exits on one of the ramps while Barney ends the show by saying, [...] "And remember, I love you," [...] and blows a kiss goodbye as streamers shoot from confetti cannons behind the hills. As children pick up confetti and streamers from the ground (they are allowed to), Peek-A-Boo then escorts the entire audience to Barney's Backyard, where everyone soon exits.|$|E

50|$|The {{building}} {{does not}} resemble any one architectural style, but {{is reminiscent of}} a bungalow or cottage. Aside from {{the removal of the}} terrace, the exterior of the building resembles what the building looked like in 1927. The interior is less preserved; the floor plan is intact, but floors have been carpeted and <b>ceilings</b> <b>dropped.</b>|$|R
50|$|Modern <b>dropped</b> <b>ceilings</b> were {{initially}} created {{to hide the}} building infrastructure, including piping, wiring, and/or ductwork, by creating a plenum space above the <b>dropped</b> <b>ceiling,</b> while allowing access for repairs and inspections. <b>Drop</b> <b>ceilings</b> may {{also be used to}} hide problems, such as structural damage. Further, <b>drop</b> out <b>ceilings</b> can also conceal the sprinkler systems while still providing full fire suppression functionality.|$|R

50|$|<b>Dropped</b> <b>ceilings</b> {{and ceiling}} tiles {{were being used}} in Japan for {{aesthetic}} reasons {{as early as the}} Muromachi Period (1337 to 1573). Blackfriars Theater in London, England, built in 1596, had <b>dropped</b> <b>ceilings</b> to aid acoustics.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} ceiling that {{contributes}} to fire-resistance ratings in commercial and residential construction is the <b>dropped</b> <b>ceiling.</b> In {{the case of a}} <b>dropped</b> <b>ceiling,</b> the rating is achieved by the entire system, which is both the structure above, from which the ceilings is suspended, which could be a concrete floor or a timber floor, as well as the suspension mechanism and, finally the lowest membrane or <b>dropped</b> <b>ceiling.</b> Between the structure that the <b>dropped</b> <b>ceiling</b> is suspended from and the dropped membrane, such as a T-bar ceiling or a layer of drywall, there is often some room for mechanical and electrical piping, wiring and ducting to run.|$|R
50|$|The former school teacher's {{residence}} {{is situated}} {{east of the}} office and west of the garage. It is a small timber-framed building set on concrete flooring. It has a hipped bungalow roofline clad in corrugated galvanised iron. The core of the cottage is single skin with exposed studding lined with vertical jointed tongue and groove boarding, the <b>ceiling</b> <b>dropped</b> with battens. The cottage has casement windows with decorative window hoods and glazed and metal louvres.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} type of <b>ceiling</b> is the <b>dropped</b> <b>ceiling</b> which is {{suspended}} from structural elements above. Pipework or ducts can be run in the gap above the ceiling, and insulation and fireproofing material can be placed here. Other types of ceiling include the cathedral ceiling, the concave or barrel-shaped ceiling, the stretched ceiling and the coffered ceiling. Coving often links the ceiling to the surrounding walls. Ceilings can play a part in reducing fire hazard, and a system is available for rating the fire resistance of <b>dropped</b> <b>ceilings.</b>|$|R
50|$|This finish is also {{an option}} with <b>dropped</b> <b>ceilings.</b>|$|R
50|$|Approved Drop out (or drop-out) {{ceilings}} {{allow the}} installation of a <b>dropped</b> <b>ceiling</b> beneath existing fire sprinklers because the tiles, sometimes called melt-out ceiling tiles, are heat sensitive and designed to fall from the <b>dropped</b> <b>ceiling</b> suspension grid {{in the event of}} a fire, allowing the sprinklers to do their job.|$|R
50|$|Over the years, the {{original}} building was renovated many times. The 20 foot <b>ceilings</b> were <b>dropped</b> to 8 and 9 foot ceilings to accommodate {{air conditioning and}} had multiple uses throughout its history.|$|R

2500|$|After parking their cars—each {{containing}} concealed bombs {{timed to}} detonate at 12:00— the duo met near Harris' car and armed two [...] propane bombs {{before entering the}} cafeteria a few minutes prior {{to the beginning of}} the [...] "A" [...] lunch shift. The youths placed the duffel bags containing the bombs—set to explode at approximately 11:17a.m.—inside the cafeteria before returning to their separate vehicles to await the explosion and shoot survivors fleeing the building. Had these bombs exploded with full power, they would have killed or severely wounded all 488 students in the cafeteria and possibly collapsed the <b>ceiling,</b> <b>dropping</b> part of the library into the cafeteria.|$|R
5000|$|You Have to Burn the Rope is a {{platform}} {{game in which}} the player must guide a character through a short level through which text on how to beat the game is clearly visible. At {{the end of the}} level, the player has a boss fight against the [...] "Grinning Colossus". To beat the boss, the player must jump to one of the torches on the wall and use it to burn the rope attaching a chandelier to the <b>ceiling,</b> <b>dropping</b> it on the boss. The character can throw axes which lower the Grinning Colossus' health bar. However, the health bar regenerates too fast for the player to drain it completely.|$|R

5000|$|Many {{manufacturers}} of modern <b>dropped</b> <b>ceilings</b> include sustainability as an objective. Sustainable features may include: ...|$|R
60|$|As {{the door}} closed on him, Delly dropped on her knees. She lifted {{her head toward the}} <b>ceiling,</b> but <b>dropped</b> it again, as if tyrannically awed downward, and bent it low over, till her whole form tremulously cringed to the floor.|$|R
50|$|Lighting {{fixtures}} {{and other devices}} installed in a <b>dropped</b> <b>ceiling</b> are required to be firmly secured to the <b>dropped</b> <b>ceiling</b> framework. In {{the event of a}} fire above a <b>dropped</b> <b>ceiling</b> it is often necessary for firemen to have to pull down the ceiling in a hurry to quickly gain access to the conflagration. Loose fixtures merely resting in the framework by force of gravity can become unseated and swing down on their armorflex power cables to hit the firemen below. Binding the fixtures to the framework assures that if the framework must be pulled down the fixture will come down with it and not become a pendulous swinging hazard to the firemen.|$|R
5000|$|Most phone systems {{use this}} type of cable. The common color is gray and made of {{polyvinyl}} chloride (PVC). Most manufactures have standardized on this color for this material. Another standardized color is white, usually associated with plenum cable. Plenum cable is cable used in plenum spaces of buildings. The plenum [...] is the space used for air circulation for {{heating and air conditioning}} systems, by providing a location for ductwork. Space between the structural <b>ceiling</b> and the <b>dropped</b> <b>ceiling</b> or under a raised floor is typically considered plenum. Some <b>drop</b> <b>ceiling</b> designs create a tight seal that does not allow for airflow and therefore may not be considered a plenum air-handling space.|$|R

40|$|Since the 12 th century, pulpits and pulpit reflectors (canopies) {{were widely}} used in churches. This paper studies the {{acoustic}} effectiveness of such devices based on in site measurements (STI and D 50) in four (unoccupied) churches with pulpits with and without the canopy. The pulpit reflector can remove the late reflection resulting from a high ceiling and makes possible to improve the listening conditions at medium distance from the pulpit. The pulpit reflector effectiveness decreases and becomes even unfavourable when {{the height of the}} <b>ceiling</b> <b>drops</b> (h < 10 m) and when the distance to the speaker increases. The absolute variations of speech intelligibility ratings are generally rather weak (average STI variation from + 0. 01 to- 0. 03), but can increase in the presence of an assembly...|$|R
50|$|A plenum {{space is}} a part of a {{building}} that can facilitate air circulation for heating and air conditioning systems, by providing pathways for either heated/conditioned or return airflows, usually at greater than atmospheric pressure. Space between the structural <b>ceiling</b> and the <b>dropped</b> <b>ceiling</b> or under a raised floor is typically considered plenum; however, some drop-ceiling designs create a tight seal that does not allow for airflow and therefore may not be considered a plenum air-handling space.|$|R
50|$|Another {{advantage}} of a <b>dropped</b> <b>ceiling</b> is that the easily removed ceiling panels offer instant access to the plenum, greatly simplifying repairs or alterations.|$|R
50|$|Kahn {{left the}} {{carefully}} organized pipes and ducts in the ceilings of each floor fully exposed to view, partly as an architectural statement and partly {{to make it}} easier to reconfigure laboratory equipment when necessary. Several departments installed <b>dropped</b> <b>ceilings</b> anyway; the microbiology labs, which require strict dust control, were especially in need of them. The partitions and <b>dropped</b> <b>ceilings</b> together interfered with the planned air circulation patterns in the towers, a problem that was not resolved until a renovation in the 1980s.|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the ideas of}} ?<b>drop</b> <b>ceilings?,</b> that full-time employees who switch to reduced hours thereafter face an hours ceiling such that a return to full-time employment is difficult, and of ?trap-door floors?, that full-time employees may be denied the opportunity to reduce their hours and instead face a choice between full-time employment and quitting the job. These ideas derive from the potential existence of norms around the ideal worker and motherhood. Relevant hypotheses are developed and tested using information on usual and preferred working time from the first two waves of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey. The key findings are that women face <b>drop</b> <b>ceilings</b> significantly more often than men; that professionals and managers confront trap-door floors significantly more often than employees in other occupations; and that trap-door floor effects are generally stronger than <b>drop</b> <b>ceiling</b> effects in the data...|$|R

50|$|On July 10, 2006 at {{approximately}} 11 p.m. four three-ton sections of a concrete <b>drop</b> <b>ceiling</b> inside the I-90 Fort Point Channel tunnel {{leading to the}} Ted Williams Tunnel collapsed. A section of ceiling fell {{on top of a}} car traveling through the connector tunnel, killing 38-year-old passenger Milena Del Valle and slightly injuring her husband Angel Del Valle, who was driving. The cause of the collapse was later determined to be the failure of adhesives connecting a steel tieback suspending the concrete <b>drop</b> <b>ceiling</b> to the main ceiling above.|$|R
