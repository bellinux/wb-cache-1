40|$|Abstract—Green paver blocks is an {{ecofriendly}} {{method of}} making <b>concrete</b> <b>paver</b> block using geopolymer <b>concrete.</b> <b>Paver</b> blocks {{have been in}} use since thousands of years. Due to rapid infrastructure development cement concrete {{is the second most}} consumed commodity on earth today. Portland cement generates large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO 2) which is responsible for global warming since it is a greenhouse gas. Environmental responsibility has initiated research in sustainability and ecofriendly methods for infrastructure development. The other great problem today is disposal of solid waste. Coal fired thermal power plants generate solid waste in the form of fly ash and pond ash. Disposal of these wastes is a major engineering challenge today with more stringent environmental laws. Today research has combined sustainability with waste management leading to a wonderful product called geopolymer concrete. This paper reports on the use of geopolymer concrete in precast <b>concrete</b> <b>paver</b> blocks and compares the performance with the commercial available OPC paver blocks of the same mix proportions. The mix design with a target strength of 47 MPa was developed to create paver blocks suitable for highways. The tests were done and the results tabulated.

40|$|This paper {{examined}} the factors influencing the long-term hydraulic performance of some stormwater infiltration systems (swale and {{two types of}} permeable pavements) in Växjö, southern Sweden. The infiltration capacities of 9 permeable pavements and 2 swales sites, all with different ages ranging from 1 year to 14 years, were measured using replicate double ring infiltrometers. The sites were either constructed of swale (2), interlocking <b>concrete</b> <b>pavers</b> (ICP) filled with gravel (2), <b>concrete</b> grid <b>pavers</b> (CGP) filled with gravel (3), or <b>concrete</b> grid <b>pavers</b> (CGP) filled with grass (4).

40|$|<b>Concrete</b> <b>paver</b> blocks {{are special}} pre-cast pieces of {{concrete}} blocks of non-interlocking or interlocking types, {{commonly used in}} exterior landscaping pavement applications. Properly designed and constructed paver blocks give excellent performance at locations where conventional pavement systems have lower service life due {{to a number of}} environmental, geological constraints. But with the use of high performance concrete they can be designed to sustain light, medium, heavy and very heavy traffic conditions under any constraints.

The process of groove determination was first performed before the USCP were tested for compression and flexural strength. The groove was determined based on the theory of bending stress. Combined with several factors, the basic groove shapes chosen were rectangular and triangular.

40|$|The {{addition}} of artificial resources (nest boxes, shelter sites) to degraded habitats may help reverse {{the decline of}} species that rely on these structures. In south-eastern Australia, the endangered broad-headed snake (Hoplocephalus bungaroides) and its major prey, the velvet gecko (Oedura lesueurii), use exposed sandstone rocks for diurnal shelter sites. Removal of these sandstone “bush-rocks” for landscaping urban gardens {{has contributed to the}} decline of both species, and recent studies suggest that rock removal affects broad-headed snakes indirectly, via a decline in prey numbers. Thus, one way to restore degraded sandstone habitat is to provide artificial rocks for the snakes 2 ̆ 7 major prey, the velvet gecko. To investigate this possibility, we placed 128 square <b>concrete</b> <b>pavers</b> (19 cm wide, 5 cm thick) at three study sites in Morton National Park, where velvet geckos and broad-headed snakes are relatively common. We manipulated crevice width (4 vs 8 mm) and temperature of <b>concrete</b> <b>pavers</b> (shaded vs exposed) to determine how these factors influence retreat-site selection by velvet geckos. We monitored the usage of these artificial habitats by geckos and invertebrates over a 1 -year period. During the cooler months most velvet geckos selected exposed pavers with narrow crevices. Larger geckos used wider crevices than did smaller conspecifics. Our results show that habitat restoration with appropriate-sized <b>concrete</b> <b>pavers</b> may be a feasible conservation technique for degraded rock outcrops. We recommend the use of large pavers (30 – 45 cm wide, 5 – 10 cm thick) with a variety of crevice sizes (up to 10 mm) to maximize the diversity of retreat-sites for broad-headed snakes and saxicolous lizards...|$|R
