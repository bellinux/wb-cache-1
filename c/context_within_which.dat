25|$|One however {{needs to}} view these {{issues from the}} <b>context</b> <b>within</b> <b>which</b> Pozderac operated. Being part of the {{communist}} system Pozderac saw political ascendance possible only within the system. If one adds to this the patriarchic nature of the Balkans, his strong leadership was proven {{to be the only}} potent power that could make the difference in Bosnia and Herzegovina of the communist era. He was the follower of the conviction that political, legal, philosophical, religious, literary, artistic and other progress is based on the economic progress. He is credited for implementing processes that led the economic revitalization of Bosnia and Herzegovina that contributed to strengthening of the cultural independence and identity of Bosnia within Yugoslav federation.|$|E
25|$|Unger’s aim is twofold. First, {{to level}} a critique, expansion, and defense of modern {{thinking}} about the human and society “so that this practice can better withstand the criticisms that philosophy since Hume and Kant has leveled against it.” And second, to develop a prescriptive theory of human identity centered on what Unger calls the passions—our raw responses {{to the world that}} are ambivalent towards reasons but also act in the service of reason. He outlines nine passions that organize and are organized by our dealings with others: lust, despair, hatred, vanity, jealousy, envy, faith, hope, and love. While these emotional states may be seen as raw emotion, their expression is always conditioned by the <b>context</b> <b>within</b> <b>which</b> the individual mobilizes or learns to mobilize them.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, Rimé et al. {{noted that}} in {{contemporary}} scientific research, emotions {{were considered to be}} responses to preceding events that are then restrained by self-control and self-restoration. As such, emotions were generally regarded as ephemeral and intrapersonal experiences. Rimé also later pointed out that attachment theory rendered emotional regulation to be of an interpersonal nature for children, yet to become mature adults one must become autonomous and capable of regulating emotions independently. In the field of psychology a healthy individual is typically seen as “self-contained, independent and self-reliant, capable of asserting himself and influencing his environment”. Riger also suggests that this individualistic view of emotional regulation could have been influenced by the <b>context</b> <b>within</b> <b>which</b> it had been studied, i.e. the United States.|$|E

Recognizing the {{temporary}} and circulatory nature of biennales, which by definition reflect shifting curatorial themes and structures in rotation, Kataoka's work {{as part of}} the ROUNDTABLE curatorial team confronted the diverse inter-connectivities of different <b>contexts</b> <b>within</b> <b>which</b> we can find our own temporal positioning.|$|R
25|$|In general, the {{determinants}} of splicing work in an inter-dependent manner that depends on context, so that the rules governing how splicing is regulated from a splicing code. The presence of a particular cis-acting RNA sequence element may increase {{the probability that a}} nearby site will be spliced in some cases, but decrease the probability in other cases, depending on context. The <b>context</b> <b>within</b> <b>which</b> regulatory elements act includes cis-acting context that is established by the presence of other RNA sequence features, and trans-acting context that is established by cellular conditions. For example, some cis-acting RNA sequence elements influence splicing only if multiple elements are present in the same region so as to establish context. As another example, a cis-acting element can have opposite effects on splicing, depending on which proteins are expressed in the cell (e.g., neuronal versus non-neuronal PTB). The adaptive significance of splicing silencers and enhancers is attested by studies showing that there is strong selection in human genes against mutations that produce new silencers or disrupt existing enhancers.|$|E
25|$|In the 18th century, {{the bishops}} of Râmnic, {{witnessing}} two decades of Austrian domination {{and a number of}} Austro-Turkish confrontations in Oltenia, visibly acquired a national identity and a feeling of cultural, linguistic and religious cohesion with other Romanians. This helps explain why in their town more than in the national capital Bucharest, where Ottoman pressures and the financial interests of Phanariote Princes and dignitaries restricted such sentiments, printing activity in Romanian was done with the intention of aiding the popular masses, and why in spite of the difficulties involved, they strove to preserve traditional cultural and spiritual ties to areas inhabited by Romanians. With this goal in mind, they took care to print the most needed religious texts in the best translations, to present and comment on them in careful prefaces, to promote notions of spiritual, religious, cultural and political unity and to enrich a literary Romanian language with a basis in liturgical use. Each of the ten bishops involved (as well as Galaction, after 1800) had his own particular merits shaped by the <b>context</b> <b>within</b> <b>which</b> he operated. While the writing of Anthim, defrocked and assassinated, were forbidden, those of Damaschin took on his literary and liturgical prestige. Chesarie, although only bishop for a short while, had original ideas on Romanian history, accounting for Iorga's appreciation.|$|E

500|$|The {{sociology}} {{of knowledge is}} the study of the relationship between human thought and the social <b>context</b> <b>within</b> <b>which</b> it arises, and of the effects prevailing ideas have on societies. The term first came into widespread use in the 1920s, when a number of German-speaking theorists, most notably Max Scheler, and Karl Mannheim, wrote extensively on it. With the dominance of functionalism through the middle years of the 20th century, the {{sociology of}} knowledge tended to remain on the periphery of mainstream sociological thought. It was largely reinvented and applied much more closely to everyday life in the 1960s, particularly by Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann in The Social Construction of Reality (1966) and is still central for methods dealing with qualitative understanding of human society (compare socially constructed reality). The [...] "archaeological" [...] and [...] "genealogical" [...] studies of Michel Foucault are of considerable contemporary influence.|$|E
500|$|The neo-classical monuments that proliferated {{at the end}} of the 18th {{century and}} the start of the 19th, such as The Kymin at Monmouth, were {{attempts}} to meld the concepts of Britishness with the Greco-Roman empires of classical antiquity. The new and expanding British Empire provided [...] "unprecedented opportunities for upward mobility and the accumulations of wealth", and so the [...] "Scottish, Welsh and Irish populations were prepared to suppress nationalist issues on pragmatic grounds". The British Empire was [...] "crucial to the idea of a British identity and to the self-image of Britishness". Indeed, the Scottish welcomed Britishness during the 19th century [...] "for it offered a <b>context</b> <b>within</b> <b>which</b> they could hold on to their own identity whilst participating in, and benefiting from, the expansion of the [...] Empire". Similarly, the [...] "new emphasis of Britishness was broadly welcomed by the Welsh who considered themselves to be the lineal descendants of the ancient Britons – a word that was still used to refer exclusively to the Welsh". For the English, however, by the Victorian era their enthusiastic adoption of Britishness had meant that, for them, Britishness [...] "meant the same as 'Englishness'", so much so that [...] "Englishness and Britishness" [...] and [...] "'England' and 'Britain' were used interchangeably in a variety of contexts". Britishness came to borrow heavily from English political history because England had [...] "always been the dominant component of the British Isles in terms of size, population and power"; Magna Carta, common law and hostility to continental Europe were English factors that influenced British sensibilities.|$|E
2500|$|To {{amplify the}} <b>context</b> <b>within</b> <b>which</b> {{polygyny}} occupies an Islamic relevance, one should {{look to the}} current debates surrounding polygyny in Islam, and more broadly, polygamy, and the implications that emerged from their contextual transition from the jahiliyya to the Islamic era. Two highly dichotomous views on the social significance of the institutionalization of polygyny by Islam are provided by Leila Ahmed and Asghar Ali Engineer, and their views differ {{on the question of}} women. How did the establishment of polygyny in Islam as the only alternative to monogamy change the social condition of women? ...|$|E
40|$|Socio-economic <b>context(s)</b> <b>within</b> <b>which</b> apocalyptic texts flourished {{during the}} inter-testamentary period Social {{contexts}} form the perspective or symbolic framework of interpretation in which texts {{are to be}} read and understood because these texts originated <b>within</b> these <b>contexts.</b> An important question in the research into Jewish apocalyptic texts which originated in the period from 200 BCE to 100 CE is: What were the socio-economic <b>context</b> or <b>contexts</b> <b>within</b> <b>which</b> these texts originated and functioned? Various answers have been given: Apocalyptic has been viewed {{as the result of}} the wisdom tradition, of a pessimistic view of history, as a continuation and discontinuation with prophecy, as a reinstitution of myth in Hebrew thinking, as a result of orientation to a symbolic universe oriented to a supernatural world, and as a sociological matrix of alienation. Today many researchers agree that the origins of apocalyptic can only be described in terms of each apocalypse itself, in the light of Jewish experience during the Seleucid and Hasmonean periods...|$|R

He further stated that an inquiry would be held to {{determine the cause of}} the incident. [...] However, the inquiry was not empowered {{to take into account the}} promotion of terrorism and jihad by the Pakistani government itself, especially by various arms of the Pakistan Army, which contributed to the socio-cultural <b>context</b> <b>within</b> <b>which</b> terrorists are often seen as 'heroes' and 'patriots'.|$|E

2500|$|As {{described}} above, many animal gestures, postures, and sounds, convey {{meaning to}} nearby animals. These signals are often easier to describe than to interpret. It is tempting, especially with domesticated animals and apes, to anthropomorphize, that is, to interpret animal actions in human terms, but {{this can be}} quite misleading; for example, an ape's [...] "smile" [...] is often a sign of aggression. Also, the same gesture may have different meanings depending on <b>context</b> <b>within</b> <b>which</b> it occurs. [...] For example, a domestic dog's tail wag and posture {{may be used in}} different ways to convey many meanings as illustrated in Charles Darwin's The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals published in 1872.

2500|$|The {{history of}} {{meditation}} is intimately {{bound up with}} the religious <b>context</b> <b>within</b> <b>which</b> it was practiced. Some authors have even suggested the hypothesis that the emergence of the capacity for focused attention, an element of many methods of meditation, {{may have contributed to the}} latest phases of human biological evolution. Some of the earliest references to meditation are found in the Hindu Vedas of India. Wilson translates the most famous Vedic mantra [...] "Gayatri" [...] as: [...] "We meditate on that desirable light of the divine Savitri, who influences our pious rites" [...] (Rigveda : Mandala-3, Sukta-62, Rcha-10). Around the 6th to 5th centuries BCE, other forms of meditation developed via Confucianism and Taoism in China as well as Hinduism, Jainism, and early Buddhism in Nepal and India.|$|E
2500|$|On 15 July 2014, {{following}} {{his visit to}} Kiev, Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs Radosław Sikorski warned about the dangers posed by the continued Russian military support for pro-Russian separatists, especially ground-to-air missiles. On 17 July, an Associated Press journalist saw a Buk launcher in Snizhne, a town in Donetsk Oblast, [...] southeast of the crash site. The reporter also saw seven separatist tanks near the town. Associated Press journalists reported that the Buk M-1 was operated by a man [...] "with unfamiliar fatigues and a distinctive Russian accent" [...] escorted by two civilian vehicles. The battle around Saur Mogila has been suggested as the possible <b>context</b> <b>within</b> <b>which</b> the missile that brought down MH17 was fired, as separatists deployed increasingly sophisticated anti-aircraft weaponry in this battle, and had brought down several Ukrainian jets in July. A Ukrainian An-26 was scheduled to deliver paratroopers to the battle arena on 17 July and, according to Russian expert Vadim Lukashevich, the separatists [...] "might have been waiting just for them". According to the final report of the Dutch Safety Board, no An-26 was downed in Eastern Ukraine that day.|$|E
2500|$|But {{the ladies}} of Winchester had brought some of this harsh {{treatment}} on themselves. From the very first Union occupation, they had treated Federal soldiers despicably. Going to church one Sunday, one woman accidentally dropped her Bible or prayer brook. A passing soldier immediately {{picked it up and}} offered it to her. She glared at him hatefully and refused it. When the Union army was retreating through town during the First Battle of Winchester, the civilians, but most particularly the women, uttered the vilest language, hurling at them anything that came to hand. Then they began shooting from their windows or yards. Any of a number of soldiers were killed by women firing at them. One cavalryman, wounded in the foot, sat on a doorstep. The woman of the house opened the door and asked him if he could walk. [...] "No," [...] he told her. Could she see his pistol she asked. Innocently, he gave it to her. She put it to his head and told him to get off her doorstep. As he tried to limp away, she shot him in the back. That night, several young soldiers took a vow to punish the women of Winchester for murdering their comrades when they returned. This is the <b>context</b> <b>within</b> <b>which</b> Milroy was operating.|$|E
