In the first part we explain how the <b>collective</b> management of <b>intellectual</b> <b>property</b> rights can be used to facilitate arm’s length technology transfers. Its objective is then to facilitate the access to information about variety, to reduce negotiation costs and to optimize the management of prices. In the second part we explain how the <b>collective</b> management of <b>intellectual</b> <b>property</b> rights can be used to improve the innovation production processes by proposing a wide set of organizational structures ranging from centralized organizations that rely heavily on planning, to decentralized organizations that use incentives to motivate participants. As a conclusion, we highlight new challenges for competition policy generated by those tools. <b>INTELLECTUAL</b> <b>PROPERTY</b> RIGHT;CONSORTIA;BIOTECHNOLOGY;OPEN SOURCE;SOFTWARE...|$|R

40|$|Our {{contribution}} aims at introducing {{and discussing}} <b>Collective</b> <b>Intellectual</b> <b>Property</b> Rights as a juridical framework for economic development, that could mark {{a step forward}} in tourism planning {{in the sense of}} supporting a higher degree of creativity in tourist activity. Our approach is {{based on the idea that}} local creative knowledge can be used in the production of a valuable tourist experience. Since the main components of creative knowledge are heritage, identity, material culture, lifestyle and savoir faire, the local issue is clearly very important. However, local creative knowledge needs to be embedded into a full-fledged economic production process in order to become a development asset for the community. The possibility of defending and strengthening creative clusters as pillars of tourist production faces two major challenges: the structure of the market to which it is directed (tourism), and the global development of the world economy, which tends to disenfranchise production processes from locally embedded knowledge, dissipating place advantages. The viability of a process of “commodification” of creative knowledge can then be viewed in the light of such turbulent environment, focusing on regions where the pressure to market local resources to visitors is higher. There especially, a specific tool as the institution of <b>Collective</b> <b>Intellectual</b> <b>Property</b> Rights on culture-based goods and landscape elements may contribute towards the stated aims...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Developing and {{delivering}} appropriate, affordable, well-adapted medicines for HIV/AIDS remains an urgent challenge: as first-line therapies fail, {{increasing numbers of}} people require costly second-line therapy; one-third of ARVs are not available in pediatric formulations; and certain key first- and second-line triple fixed-dose combinations do not exist or sufficient suppliers are lacking. UNITAID aims to help solve these problems through an innovative initiative for the <b>collective</b> management of <b>intellectual</b> <b>property</b> (IP) rights – a patent pool for HIV medicines. The idea behind a patent pool is that patent holders- companies, governments, researchers or universities- voluntarily offer, under certain conditions, the IP related to their inventions to the patent pool. Any company that wants to use the IP to produce or develop medicines can seek a license from the pool against the payment of royalties, and may then produce the medicines for use in developing countries (conditional upon meeting agreed quality standards). The patent pool will be a voluntary mechanism, meaning its success will largely depend on the willingness of pharmaceutical companies to participate and commit their IP to the pool. Generic producers must also be willing to cooperate. The pool {{has the potential to}} provide benefits to all...|$|R

Classification of <b>intellectual</b> <b>property</b> objects depending on their most essential features is analyzed. Different approaches to classification of <b>intellectual</b> <b>property</b> subjects are considered.

40|$|Origin labels, more {{specifically}} Geographical Indications (GIs), allow organised producers to define quality standards and defend their food products’ reputation while highlighting their geographical origin and value to consumers. Café de Colombia {{was the first}} non-European food product registered as Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) under EU legislation (510 / 2006, followed by 1151 / 2012). This paper aims to identify the dynamics of collective efforts and {{the rules of the}} game developed by coffee growers to protect the <b>collective</b> <b>intellectual</b> <b>property</b> right. Our guiding research questions are: i) to what extent can the Ostrom’s design principles explain effective collective action for GI registration and implementation? and ii) can collective action for GIs re-shape relations between supply chain actors and support producers in gaining control over origin products? We collected data using semi-structured interviews and document analysis, which we then processed in a qualitative text analysis. Results show that the principles are very helpful for understanding the internal collective action of coffee growers and also clearly show the challenges in the interaction with industrial coffee processors (e. g. international roasters, brand owners). A pure focus on the producers’ collective action for establishing and managing the origin protection does not give a full picture, since green coffee beans are roasted and commercialised abroad. The GI has already re-shaped the relationships along the supply chains, as international roasters sign the producers’ rules governing the PGI use. The commercial GI impact however, will depend on consumers’ willingness to appreciate and pay extra for high quality origin coffee as well as the readiness of international roasters or brand owners to emphasise on origin coffee, in addition to their brands of blended coffee...|$|E
40|$|New {{crops are}} {{regularly}} being introduced into cultivation, typically {{accompanied by a}} very small agricultural knowledge base. Often, {{there is a lack}} of agronomic research information or production experience upon which to rely, nor plant varieties optimised for an agricultural system. The challenges of a new industry may be compounded by a lack of consumer awareness of the new product and value-chain models need to be developed to suit the product. Frequently the plant species being developed into a new crop is one traditionally used as a food source or for medicinal or other applications by Indigenous people. Thus a complex series of additional factors comes into play – consent of the original custodians, respect and acknowledgement of their traditional knowledge that may be exploited, and totemic, kinship and spiritual associations that may be impacted. Establishing benefit sharing for the hereditary stewards, and protection of traditional <b>collective</b> <b>intellectual</b> <b>property</b> is an important ethical consideration. In the 21 st century, the previous unjust exploitation of the traditional knowledge of the original custodians without acknowledgement or benefit sharing, is no longer accepted. However, prevailing strategies to safeguard intellectual property and traditional knowledge associated with native plants, for instance, to ensure that benefit is captured for Indigenous hereditary custodians may be lacking or may contravene Indigenous customary law. Where scientific, cultural, ethical, legal and commercial issues interact at the emergence of a new crop industry, stakeholders from various perspectives will bring critical, sometimes conflicting, impediments to resolve. The challenges that arise in the commercial exploitation of the Australian Bush Tomato, Solanum centrale, and its horticultural development, are reviewed and the approaches to their resolution are discussed...|$|E

Thus, GIs {{can contribute to the}} transmission and retention of culinary heritages and historical production practices. Based on an analysis of application documents, we compare the historical linkages of all the Japanese and Austrian GIs’ products. Although more than one-half of the Japanese applications refer to historical roots in the 20 th century, the median of the Austrian GIs’ linkages is in the 17 th century. To closely examine these GIs’ linkages, and to better understand their relevance to current cultivation practices, we compare three Japanese cases with roots of diverging depth to the first Austrian GI regarding motivations, geographical and historical linkages, and current cultivation practices and governance. The comparison found that all four products refer to the historical roots of the product name, the product varieties, or cultivation techniques. However, deeper roots do not automatically translate into higher priorities of protecting these historical linkages. The four in-depth case studies found that historic provenance and traditional production methods, although prominently highlighted in the official GI documents of all four GIs, are eclipsed by commercial motivations for GI protection and/or current production practices. In the cases analyzed, we find some potential mismatch between GI historical claims in registration documents and actual GI cultivation and GI management practices.
