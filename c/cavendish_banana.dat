5|$|Fungi are {{important}} crop pathogens, as they reproduce rapidly, affect {{a wide range}} of crops around the world, cause some 85% of plant diseases, and can create serious economic losses. The range of types of fungi involved is also wide, including Ascomycetes such as Fusarium causing wilt, Basidiomycetes such as Ustilago causing smuts and Puccinia causing cereal rusts, and Oomycetes such as Phytophthora causing potato late blight and the resulting Great Irish Famine of 1845-1849. Where crop diversity is low, and in particular where single varieties of major crops are nearly universal, fungal diseases can cause the loss of an entire crop, as with the potato in Ireland, and as with the monocultured crop of maize (corn) in the USA in 1970, where over a billion dollars' worth of production was lost. Similarly, the 'Gros Michel' seedless banana crop was essentially completely destroyed worldwide in the 1950s by the wild fungus, Fusarium oxysporum. It was replaced by the <b>Cavendish</b> <b>banana,</b> which in turn was in 2015 facing total destruction by the same disease.|$|E

5000|$|The {{fruits of}} the <b>Cavendish</b> <b>bananas</b> are eaten raw, used in baking, fruit salads, fruit compotes, and to {{complement}} foods. The outer skin is partially green when sold in food markets, and turns yellow when it ripens. As it ripens the starches turn to sugar making a sweeter fruit. When it reaches its final stage (stage 7), brown/black [...] "sugar spots" [...] develop. When overripe, the skin turns black and the flesh becomes mushy. Bananas ripen naturally until they are picked. Once picked they no longer turn yellow on their own, {{and need to be}} gassed with ethylene gas to start up ripening again. Bananas which are turning yellow emit ethylene. Most retailers sell bananas in stages 3-6, with stage 4 being the most ideal.The PLUs used for <b>Cavendish</b> <b>bananas</b> are 4011 (yellow) and 4186 (small yellow).

5000|$|There is {{a belief}} that {{artificial}} banana flavour tastes [...] "fake" [...] because {{it was intended to}} mimic the flavour of the 'Gros Michel' and not the <b>Cavendish</b> <b>banana.</b> This is due to the main chemical in banana flavoring being isoamyl acetate, the same chemical found in all bananas. Isoamyl acetate is popular due to it being a versatile and easy to work with compound. It is perceived to be closer in taste to a Gros Michel banana due to that strain having a higher concentration of that chemical and fewer [...] "volatile components" [...] that are found in other bananas. The <b>Cavendish</b> <b>banana</b> has a lot more complexity in its makeup, and therefore tastes less like pure isoamyl acetate. Whether or not banana flavorings were purposely designed to taste more like Gros Michel is unknown.|$|E
