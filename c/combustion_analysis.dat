HVAC contractors, firemen and engineers use combustion analyzers to test the efficiency of a burner during the combustion process.

50|$|Applications for <b>combustion</b> <b>analysis</b> involve {{only the}} {{elements}} of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), and sulfur (S) as combustion of materials containing them convert these elements to their oxidized form (CO2, H2O, NO or NO2, and SO2) under high temperature high oxygen conditions. Notable interests for these elements involve measuring total nitrogen in food or feed to determine protein percentage, measuring sulfur in petroleum products, or measuring total organic carbon (TOC) in water.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} form of {{elemental}} analysis, CHNS analysis, is accomplished by <b>combustion</b> <b>analysis.</b> In this technique, a sample is burned in an excess of oxygen and various traps, collecting the combustion products: carbon dioxide, water, and nitric oxide. The masses of these combustion products can be used to calculate the composition of the unknown sample. Modern elemental analyzers are also capable of simultaneous determination of sulfur along with CHN in the same measurement run.|$|E

50|$|Gravimetric {{analysis}} {{usually only}} {{provides for the}} analysis of a single element, or a limited group of elements, at a time. Comparing modern dynamic flash combustion coupled with gas chromatography with traditional <b>combustion</b> <b>analysis</b> will show that the former is both faster and allows for simultaneous determination of multiple elements while traditional determination allowed only for the determination of carbon and hydrogen. Methods are often convoluted and a slight mis-step in a procedure can often mean disaster for the analysis (colloid formation in precipitation gravimetry, for example). Compare this with hardy methods such as spectrophotometry and one will find that analysis by these methods is much more efficient.|$|E
50|$|Liebig {{reaffirmed the}} {{importance}} of De Saussures' findings, and used them to critique humus theories, while regretting the limitations of De Saussure's experimental techniques. Using more precise methods of measurement {{as a basis for}} estimation, he pointed out contradictions such as the inability of existing soil humus to provide enough carbon to support the plants growing in it. By the late 1830s, researchers like Karl Sprengel were using Liebig's methods of <b>combustion</b> <b>analysis</b> to assess manures, concluding that their value could be attributed to their constituent minerals. Liebig synthesized ideas about the mineral theory of plant nutrition and added his own conviction that inorganic materials could provide nutrients as effectively as organic sources.|$|E

[...] The substance was always found at the interface between the charcoal and silica particles.

50|$|In the mid 19th century, {{investigators}} proposed {{several possible}} structures for benzene which {{were consistent with}} its empirical formula, C6H6, which had been determined by <b>combustion</b> <b>analysis.</b> The first, which was proposed by Kekulé in 1865, later proved to be closest to the true structure of benzene. This structure inspired several others to propose structures that were consistent with benzene's empirical formula; for example, Ladenburg proposed prismane, Dewar proposed Dewar benzene, and Koerner and Claus proposed Claus' benzene. Some of these structures would be synthesized in the following years. Prismane, like the other proposed structures for benzene, is still often cited in the literature, because {{it is part of}} the historical struggle toward understanding the mesomeric structures and resonance of benzene. Some computational chemists still research the differences between the possible isomers of C6H6.|$|E
50|$|Once separated, each {{material}} {{phase is}} itself a chemical mixture to be further analyzed. A second-order analysis of each phase will typically involve a selection among available analytical methods to further separate these components. Analytical methods used on liquid phases might include distillation or one {{of a variety of}} chromatographic separation methods. Distillation separates the components of a liquid mixture according to differences in their boiling points. Chomatography separates components of a liquid or gaseous mixture according to differences in retention time as the mixture interacts with a stationary phase. Individual components thus separated can then be identified by a variety of detection methods, including infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry. Methods used to further analyze solids might include thermal analysis (such as thermogravimetric analysis or differential scanning calorimetry), x-ray diffraction to characterize crystalline solids, microscopy, pyrolysis, <b>combustion</b> <b>analysis,</b> or surface spectroscopic methods.|$|E

To decrease the errors, {{it is necessary to}} ensure rapid quenching of combustion gases and freezing of the composition of <b>combustion</b> products. <b>Analysis</b> is performed using a simple analytic model for heat transfer in a sampling probe. Results are given in the form of temperature time dependences, temperature profiles, and quench rates inside the probe.

50|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 20th century Heraeus became a pioneer in the automatization of <b>combustion</b> <b>analysis</b> for the determination of non-metallic elements like carbon, nitrogen, sulphur, hydrogen and oxygen in chemicals, pharmaceuticals and environmental samples. This development was made possible through the experience gained in the high temperature furnace technology needed for melting of platinum, which has a high melting point of 1770 degrees Celsius. Building on the know-how in handling high temperatures for chemical processes, Richard Küch, a researcher at the Heraeus Platinum Smelting Factory, was able to produce quartz glass of very high purity, which is still the material of choice for combustion tubes used in modern combustion analyzers. Richard Küch’s invention together with the experience in high temperature furnace technology resulted in the commercial production of automated and semi-automated elemental analyzers. Due to the too low profitability and different nature compared to the precious metal core business of Heraeus, the Analytical Technology Division was sold in 1995 to form Elementar.|$|E
50|$|The {{hydrogen}} isotope {{effect for}} the replacement of δ-H in the decomposition of 10 was determined by analyzing the mixture of 1,2-dimethylpyrrolidine 11 and 1,2-dimethylpyrrolidine-2-d 12 for deuterium content. <b>Combustion</b> <b>analysis</b> {{of the mixture of}} deuterated and undeuterated 1,2-dimethylpyrrolidines gave the value of 0.78 atom of deuterium per molecule, which corresponds to an isotope effect (kH/kD) of 3.54. The value of the isotope effect was verified by an independent method of deuterium analysis which relied on the comparison of the intensity of the C-D stretching absorptions in the infrared spectra of mixed 1,2-dimethylpyrrolidines from the cyclization of 10 with the pure sample of 1,2-dimethylpyrrolidine-2-d 12; the IR-based analysis produced kH/kD of 3.42, which is in good agreement with the combustion analysis.Studies performed to determine kH/kD for cyclization to a primary carbon also gave kH/kD>>1, which strongly suggested that the breaking of the C-H bond proceeds to a rather considerable extent in the transition state.|$|E
5000|$|Purification steps always {{lower the}} yield, through losses {{incurred}} during {{the transfer of}} material between reaction vessels and purification apparatus or imperfect separation of the product from impurities, which may necessitate the discarding of fractions deemed insufficiently pure. The yield of the product measured after purification (typically to >95% spectroscopic purity, or to sufficient purity to pass <b>combustion</b> <b>analysis)</b> is called the isolated yield of the reaction. Yields can also be calculated by measuring the amount of product formed (typically in the crude, unpurified product) relative to a known amount of an added internal standard, using techniques like gas / liquid chromatography, or NMR spectroscopy. A yield determined using this approach is known as an internal standard yield. Yields are typically obtained in this manner to accurately determine the quantity of product produced by a reaction, irrespective of potential isolation problems. Additionally, they can be useful when isolation of the product is challenging or tedious, or when the rapid determination of an approximate yield is desired. Unless otherwise indicated, yields reported in the synthetic organic and inorganic chemistry literature refer to isolated yields, which better reflect the amount of pure product one is likely to obtain under the reported conditions, upon repeating the experimental procedure.|$|E
