40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} were {{undertaken to}} identify {{the effect of the}} secondary flow driven by Coriolis force on heat transfer in a rotating cooling channel. Experiments were carried out using a square channel simulating sudden entry condition. The Reynolds number was varied in the range of 6, 500 - 14, 000, with the rotation number in the range 0 - 0. 33. The heat transfer coefficient was obtained using a transient technique from the temperature response of cylindrical <b>copper</b> <b>plugs</b> embedded in the channel walls. Due to the low thermal conductivity of the wall material, the wall temperature follows the freestream temperature closely, resulting in small buoyancy effects. The results indicate a large reduction in the heat transfer coefficient on the leading surface and a small increase on the trailing surface. The change observed in the developing flow region and the developed flow region was different. On both surfaces a reduction in heat transfer coefficient was observed at rotation number less than 0. 06. The results indicate that the heat transfer coefficient on the leading surface may be reduced by as much as 50 percent of stationary channel value...|$|R

50|$|The Emmons {{cemetery}} site {{is located}} on the top and along the slope of a section of bluff on the western bank of the Illinois River. At the time of its discovery it was owned by Merrill Emmons of Astoria, Illinois, who undertook extensive excavations of the site. The burials were in several small burial mounds located on the lower slope. The cemetery area measures about 50 ft square. Eighty three burials were found at the site, most in an extended position and oriented on a north to south axis with their heads to the south, although a few were oriented east to west. Five of the burials were flexed, one was semi-flexed and one was a bundle burial. The burials contained many grave goods, including fifty five examples of Mississippian culture pottery (including some imported exotic varieties), stone ear <b>plugs,</b> <b>copper</b> and copper covered objects, marine shell objects and pearl beads. It is considered a rather rich collection of grave goods by the standards of other local sites. The site is possibly associated with two nearby village and platform mound sites, Rose Mounds and the Fiedler Site.|$|R

50|$|The Gw Pat 90 was {{designed}} for the SIG SG 550 when it came into production in 1987, replacing the SIG SG 510. Previous experience {{of a change in}} standard rifle had proved that changing the distance of fire for the training ranges was more expensive than the design of a new ammunition; this prompted the design of a cartridge nominally capable at 300 meters. The cartridge was also designed to reduce pollution by controlling lead emissions. The bullet was originally clad with a nickel alloy jacket, however, this was found to cause excessive barrel wear, so in 1998 the nickel jackets were replaced with tombac jackets. In addition, in 1999 a <b>copper</b> <b>plug</b> was added {{to the base of the}} bullet to address environmental concerns.|$|E
5000|$|The {{history of}} marking the Western Australian border {{on the ground}} states that the [...] "Austral Pillar" [...] and the [...] "Deakin Pillar" [...] are points used to {{determine}} their position east of Greenwich and then fix a border from, in this case {{used to determine the}} line of the 129th meridian east longitude, as the Western Australian border.

3000|$|The Seebeck {{coefficient}} (S) is {{a measure}} of the magnitude of an induced thermoelectric voltage in response to a temperature difference across the material (i.e., S[*]=[*]−[*]ΔV/ΔT). We measured S by using the setup shown in Fig.  1 a. For creating a temperature difference between the bottom <b>copper</b> <b>plug</b> and the top <b>copper</b> <b>plug,</b> a TEG was plugged into a DC voltage source and set at 2.334  V (Fig.  2 a). The thermocouples, along with soldered copper wires, were connected to a data collection unit interfaced to LabVIEW to allow measurement of voltage and temperature difference between the copper plugs (Fig.  2 a). The source was then turned on for 90  s. After 90  s, measurements of voltage and temperature difference were taken until the temperature difference between the copper plugs was ΔT[*]≥[*] 5  K (Fig.  2 a). The thermocouples monitored the temperature gradient across the particles, and the copper wires soldered to the plugs read the S voltage produced.

30|$|Resistive {{random access}} memory (RRAM), relying on the {{reversely}} switching between high resistance state (HRS) and low resistance state (LRS), has been widely explored {{as one of the}} most promising candidates due to its key advantages, such as simple structure, scalability potential, and complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatibility [1 - 6]. Nevertheless, the deficient switching mechanisms and ungenerous reliability still present a significant barrier to implement RRAM into large-scale commercial applications. Cation-based electrochemical metallization cell (ECM) and anion-based valence change memory (VCM) are two main categories of RRAM [1]. The ECM device also called as conductive bridge {{random access memory}} (CBRAM), whose switching mechanism is governed by creation (SET operation) and dissolution (RESET operation) of the metallic conductive filament (CF), likely related with the active metal species such as Ag or Cu [5, 6]. On the other hand, the switching behavior of VCM is triggered by the drift of oxygen anions [7, 8]. The copper-based CBRAM, which takes the advantage of the <b>copper</b> <b>plug</b> or copper line as the electrode, is a favorable choice with respect to cost-effective fabrication [9 - 11]. According to the CF model of CBRAM, the data retention is related with the diffusion of metal species [12, 13]. In the case of LRS, the lateral diffusion of metal ions out of the CF causes a decrease of CF diameter or metal concentration in the CF, resulting in the degradation of LRS retention, whereas the degradation of HRS retention stems from the reconstruction of CF due to the vertical ions diffusion from the residual CF to the rupture region [12 - 14]. It has been reported that the retention of HRS or LRS was highly dependent on the resistance value of HRS or LRS, respectively [14 - 16]. The activation energy required for metal species diffusing in the electrolyte also affected the HRS and LRS retention greatly [16 - 22]. However, none of the prior arts has addressed the topic of LRS-dependent HRS retention yet.|$|E
40|$|The line N is {{a special}} superconducting line in the LHC, which is {{external}} to the cold mass. The line {{is connected to the}} cold mass every half cell, and due to this it will have the same operating pressure and temperature as the magnets. In the dispersion suppressor zones the cool down of the line N is slightly delayed with respect to the magnets, due to its geometrical design. As this delay may affect the readiness of the accelerator for operating, it is desired that it is reduced to less than two hours. In a test called String 2 a full scale model of the LHC cell was built to validate the LHC systems in working condition, and to investigate the collective behavior under various conditions. During this test, there was installed a <b>copper</b> <b>plug</b> in line N. The result showed that the cool down time of the line was delayed by more than two hours. After this test there has been designed a new copper heat exchanger that is used in the line N to make additional lambda fronts, and by this lower the cool down time of the line. The design of this heat exchanger has been chosen by mathematical models that were compared to the String 2. The finished heat exchanger has never been tested, but it is presumably that it will reduce the cool down time in line N to less than two hours. The goal of this project is to follow up a test of the heat exchanger at the cryogenic laboratory at CERN. I will also try to make a computer model of the heat exchanger, which can be verified by the result of the test. The results from this computer model can later be used to calculate the cool down time of line N, and then see if the target for the cool down time is reached...|$|E
40|$|The current {{trend in}} {{electronic}} packaging {{research is to}} integrate more functions into one package, reduce electrical path parasitic, and increase the heat conduction {{in order to make}} the final packaged system smaller, more reliable, more functional and more complete, while keeping the packaging cost low. In this trend, unconventional devices (such as MEMS and optoelectronic devices) and various substrate materials (e. g., InP, GaAs, etc.) are integrated into a single package together with conventional silicon-based ICs. The resulting novel packages are produced by both wafer-level batch processes as well as many multichip 2 D/ 3 D serial assembly processes. Therefore a complete functional unit can be built in a single package. This feature is particularly valuable in space-constrained environments such as mobile phones, as it increases the packaging efficiency while decreasing complexity of the PCB and overall design. In this thesis, the development of wafer-level fabrication processes and supplemental techniques for applications in hybrid wafer-level packaging for MEMS and optoelectronic devices is presented. Hybrid wafer-level packaging makes it possible to integrate a variety of dies (i. e., silicon IC, MEMS, optoelectronic) into one final package, while using potentially economical wafer-level batch processing. Chapter 1 introduces the concept of hybrid wafer-level packaging and the research trends in relation to MEMS and optoelectronic packaging. The scope and outline of this thesis work is also outlined. In Chapter 2, the development of the through-silicon via (TSV) fabrication process using deep reactive ion etching process is presented. First, the Bosch process is characterized with emphasis on overcoming the non-uniform etching effects, such as ARDE, to fabricate simultaneously through-silicon features with a large aspect ratio difference. Via-first and via-last fabrication methods were developed. The via-first approach involves wafer backside lapping and ultrasonic break off, while in the via-last approach an Al etch stop layer is used. Both methods are demonstrated by forming 50 -?m diameter through-silicon vias and 2 x 5 mm 2 cavities. The cavities can be used for the alignment and insertion of additional IC dies. Chapter 3 presents the development of copper electroplating for TSV filling and gold and tin plating for fabricating solder bumps. The TSV filling with copper forms a low-resistivity through-silicon interconnect which enables hybrid (RF-) MEMS wafer-level packaging. Cu-filled TSVs with a diameter of less than 50 µm and an aspect ratio of more than 5 : 1 are successfully demonstrated. The developed processing module is based on Cu electroplating in two steps in combination with a chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP). In the first electroplating step, which is performed on the wafer front side, a <b>copper</b> <b>plug</b> in the via and front-side copper structures in a photo resist mold are formed. In the second step, the wafer is turned back side up and the TSVs are filled in a bottom-up approach. The overplating features that only occur on the wafer back side are then removed in a CMP step. In the Au and Sn electroplating, the aiming application is bump fabrication. Sequential Au/Sn plating in a resist mold on an Au/Cr seed/adhesion layer was successfully used for Au 80 Sn 20 solder-bump formation. Using reflow at 300 °C, the AuSn bumps were bonded to another substrate. An electrical resistivity of 189 ???cm, and a bonding tensile strength of 36. 4 MPa were measured. Chapter 4 presents adhesive wafer-level bonding for packaging applications with a focus on electrically conductive adhesives (ECA). An ECA is basically an epoxy filled with metal flakes, such as Ag. Depending on the metal flake concentration, an ECA can further classified as an ACA (anisotropic conductive adhesive, low metal flake concentration), and an ICA (isotropic conductive adhesive, high metal flake concentration). In this chapter, the electrical resistivity of the ECA (CE 3103 WLV) with respect to the curing temperature and bonding pressure is studied. Chapter 5 describes a novel hybrid wafer-level packaging solution that is applicable to RF-MEMS devices and is based on the fabrication techniques described in the previous chapters of this thesis. In this packaging concept, a capping HRS substrate with copper-filled through-silicon vias and pre-etched cavities is wafer-level bonded to an RF-MEMS device wafer using an electrically conducted adhesive. This RF-MEMS packaging solution minimizes the packaging design effort in the RF-MEMS device design and fabrication while keeping the packaging cost low. An important aspect of this package is the possibility to include through-substrate cavities for aligned insertion of control ICs on the die-to-wafer level making it a hybrid WLP solution. Furthermore, the applied adhesive wafer-level bonding provides a low thermal budget and fewer stringent requirements on the surface quality, which might be attractive in many applications. Next to the fabrication process development, this chapter also focuses on design optimization and RF characterization. The Ansoft HFSS full 3 D EM simulation tool was used to predict and optimize the RF behavior of a packaged system. The electrical measurement data obtained from packaged CPWs are promising (i. e., insertion loss of 0. 11 dB at 10 GHz). Chapter 6 presents the initial study on thermal and thermo-mechanical aspects of a SiP-based optoelectronic package to be used in an optical network unit. A finite-element model representing the relevant parts of the package structure was built and extensive thermal and thermo-mechanical simulations were carried out. The gold bumps (i. e., their geometry and count) used to flip-chip the InP optical transceiver chip to the silicon platform represent the main optimizing parameter. The simulation results show that by increasing the bump count and decreasing the height, a sufficiently low thermal resistance between the SOA active region and the heat sink can be realized. The FEM thermal simulation results were validated by designing, fabricating and measuring flip-chip bonded micro-hotplate and resistive temperature sensor (phosphorus-doped polysilicon) arrays.
