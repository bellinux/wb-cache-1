5|$|Shortly after returning, Heather {{slips into}} a trance so John makes his excuses and quickly leaves. Upon <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> she pleads {{with her sister}} to go after John, sensing that {{something}} terrible is about to happen, but Wendy is unable {{to catch up with}} him. Meanwhile, John catches another glimpse of the mysterious figure in red and this time pursues it. He corners the elusive figure in a deserted palazzo and approaches it, believing it to be a child. Instead, it is revealed to be a hideous female dwarf, and while John is frozen in terror the dwarf pulls out a meat cleaver and cuts his throat. As the life drains from him, John realises too late that the strange sightings he has been experiencing were premonitions of his own murder and funeral.|$|E
5|$|The {{video is}} {{centered}} on Maroon 5 playing in a dimly-lit house/factory. Throughout {{the course of the}} video, items such as darts on a dart board, candles, pictures, and even members of the band with their instruments are shown fading in and out. Towards the end of the video, Adam Levine is seen walking through a narrow corridor dragging a guitar with pictures {{on both sides of the}} wall fading in and out. When he reaches the end of the corridor, he is face to face with a wall with a small light <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> and then flings his guitar backwards and then pounds on the wall. The camera then quickly moves to a scene of the band playing and the lights suddenly flickering on.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Grewgious was {{discovered}} by his ward, much discomfited by being in Miss Twinkleton’s company in Miss Twinkleton’s own sacred room.

500|$|On 11 October 2013, it was {{announced}} Halfpenny would be leaving Emmerdale. The actress said she had had [...] "an amazing experience" [...] with the show and added [...] "It's completely changed my life, as it's given me confidence and I'm <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> having learnt so much.

500|$|Giancarlo Esposito {{said that}} when he first read the script for [...] "Box Cutter", he was so shocked that he had to put it down and walk away from it. Esposito said {{he did not want to}} [...] "take any of [...] home with me" [...] and had [...] "some deep concern about being able to do it and <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> unscathed, without really hurting my spirit and my soul". He worked through these {{concerns}} by justifying Gus' actions in that, by killing Victor, he was protecting everyone else who works for him. Nevertheless, he said it was [...] "a difficult moment for me" [...] to slit Victor's throat, and that during one take he tried to hush the character to make him die more calmly. That scene took two days to film, and Esposito remained silent and focused during filming, rarely speaking to the others on set. The boots he was originally given were too large and he was concerned that he would slip, which would be out of character for Gus, who was otherwise completely calm and in control. A costume designer quickly procured the right-sized boots for him.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Sheffield University Paper in May 1965, Dylan explained the change that had occurred in his songwriting over the previous twelve months, noting [...] "The big difference is that the songs I was writing last year ... they were what I call one-dimensional songs, but my new songs I'm trying to make more three-dimensional, you know, there's more symbolism, they're written on more than one level." [...] In late 1965, Dylan commented on the writing of [...] "My Back Pages" [...] specifically during {{an interview}} with Margaret Steen for The Toronto Star: [...] "I was in my New York phase then, or at least, I was just <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> I was still keeping the things that are really really real out of my songs, for fear they'd be misunderstood. Now I don't care if they are." [...] As Dylan stated to Nat Hentoff at the time that [...] "My Back Pages" [...] and the other songs on Another Side of Bob Dylan were written, [...] "There aren't any finger pointing songs ... Now {{a lot of people are}} doing finger pointing songs. [...] You know, pointing to all the things that are wrong. [...] Me, I don't want to write for people anymore. You know, be a spokesman." ...|$|E

She heard his words in her unconscious self, CONSCIOUSLY she was as if deafened, she paid no heed to them.|$|R

Granted, Merlin wasn’t {{the most fascinating}} character going into tonight’s show, but he’s far more interesting <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> I’m interested to see how his character evolves, and if it evolves. I’m also far more compelled by Emma’s commitment to darkness, {{and whether or not}} it’s one big misdirect. After all, Emma has a new opponent {{in the form of the}} newly-heroic Rumplestiltskin. That’s going to be a showdown for the ages, I’d wager. Can’t wait." ...|$|E
