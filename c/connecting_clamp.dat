2500|$|On April 27, 1997, a {{group of}} amateur daredevils, led by {{bartender}} and stuntman Steve Trotter and composed of a mix {{of male and female}} participants, performed an unannounced guerrilla [...] "pendulum swing" [...] bungee jump off the bridge, wherein they planned to swing back and forth on a home-made bungee cord made of steel cable attached to the cast-off point. Arriving by stretch limousine, the group unexpectedly pulled over at the apex of the bridge, quickly rigged up their cable, tethered themselves to it with harnesses, and jumped over the edge. This stunt failed when the plastic sheathing on the steel cable, unable to handle the increase in forces exerted on it by the initial pendulum swing, sheared off and allowed the <b>connecting</b> <b>clamps</b> to slide freely off the cable, plunging the jumpers [...] into the water, leading to broken bones and neck injuries.

The RNAP β′-subunit Switch- 2 (SW 2) region {{is part of}} a protein network that <b>connects</b> the <b>clamp</b> domain with the RNAP body and mediates opening and closing of the active center cleft. SW 2 interacts with the template DNA near the RNAP active center and is a target for antibiotics that block DNA melting during initiation. Here, we show that substitutions of a conserved Arg 339 residue in the Escherichia coli RNAP SW 2 confer diverse effects on transcription that include defects in DNA melting in promoter complexes, decreased stability of RNAP/promoter complexes, increased apparent KM for initiating nucleotide substrates (2 - to 13 -fold for different substitutions), decreased efficiency of promoter escape, and decreased stability of elongation complexes. We propose that interactions of Arg 339 with DNA directly stabilize transcription complexes to promote stable closure of the clamp domain around nucleic acids. During initiation, SW 2 may cooperate with the σ 3. 2 region to stabilize the template DNA strand in the RNAP active site.

We then combine our asymptotic formulae for arrays of DCR and thin-bars to design a composite structure that displays a negative refraction effect and has a negative phase velocity in a frequency band, and thus behaves in many ways as a negative refractive acoustic medium (NRAM).

40|$|This thesis first {{develops}} a bistable mechanism {{that does not}} rely on internal stress or hinges for its bistability, which is then combined with transient electrothermal actuation and contact structure to develop a MEMS relay for power switching. The relay components, fabricated by a through etch of a silicon wafer using deep reactive ion etch (DRIE), move laterally in {{the plane of the}} wafer. The synthesis, analysis, design, fabrication and testing of the relay are all described in this thesis. The bistable mechanism comprises two parallel cosine curved clamped-clamped beams that are also clamped together at their centers. If designed properly it exhibits a second stable deflected shape that is nearly a mirror image of its as-fabricated shape mirrored through the centerline <b>connecting</b> its <b>clamped</b> ends. Both theoretical and finite-element analyses are applied to the modeling, design and optimization of the force-displacement characteristic of the curved beam mechanism. The analyses results agree well with experimental measurement after accounting for fabrication variations. If fabricated properly, the mechanism is mechanically robust; some mechanisms have been switched between their bistable states one million times without sign of failure. The bistable mechanism is combined with two contacts to form a crossbar relay. The contact structure is designed with flat shape and additional compliance; and proper metalization process is developed for its DRIE etched sidewalls; both contributing to a more reliable and low resistance contact. Because of bistability this relay requires no actuation power in either its on or off states. Therefore, transient electrothermal actuators to switch its states are designed, partially with a mechanical model developed for cantilevers subjected to both lateral and axial forces. (cont.) These actuators typically require 1 -ms 50 -V pulses to switch the relay. In the off state, the relay contacts stand off more than 200 V. In the on state the best relay contacts exhibit a total resistance of 60 mfQ and a current carrying capacity of 3 A. The relay can switch at a maximum 5 Hz rate. These characteristics make it a good candidate for power protection applications. by Jin Qiu. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, 2003.

The bottom and side planks of the barge were made of beech wood (Fagus sylvatica). The wood could be dendrochronologically dated using local reference chronologies with a post quem end date of AD 3. The high maximum water content of the wood (690 %), erosion of wood cell walls and degradation of the main cell-wall constituents observed under the microscope using various techniques, indicate poor preservation of the barge wood. Use of beech wood, which has good mechanical properties but very low resistance against decay organisms, and unique coupling with iron clamps indicate that the barge was solidly built.

40|$|STUDY DESIGN: Cadaver and {{preliminary}} clinical study. OBJECTIVES: To {{enhance the}} precision of screw positions for posterior transarticular fixations according to Magerl at C 1 -C 2. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The vertebral arteries are at risk during the Magerl operation and may be damaged in up to 4. 1 % of cases. Even intraoperative navigation, as often used nowadays, does not provide optimal screw positioning in all patients. METHODS: According to the three-dimensional CT data obtained for every individual cadaver or patient, a template was designed for the posterior course of C 2 : the template contains a drill guide allowing navigated screw positioning inside {{the left and right}} isthmus of C 2. For a first series of five cadavers a template with <b>clamps</b> <b>connecting</b> only to the lamina of C 2, excluding the spinous process from the interface, was carried out. For a second series of three cadavers the template was connected not only to the lamina but also to the spinous process of C 2. Both cadaver series were performed without any fluoroscopic control at surgery. Eventually the technology was applied in two clinical cases. RESULTS: The rotational stability of the template toward the lamina C 2 was insufficient in the first series, but for the second series both the entry points and screw trajectories were very satisfactory. CONCLUSIONS: Although the actual experience is limited, the idea of using a template with drill guide might simplify and shorten the surgical act {{and at the same time}} enhance the accuracy of C 1 -C 2 transarticular screw positioning. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} thesis {{presents an}} analysis of the torsional loads on V-band clamps. In some applications, the relative rotational movement of the flanges <b>connected</b> by V-band <b>clamps</b> can result in catastrophic system failure. The ability to understand the factors impacting on torsional load capacity is therefore essential. In this research project, a theoretical model of a V-band joint subjected to torsional loads was developed. This model is used to identify those parameters that will impact on the joint’s reliability. An experimental investigation was conducted to validate a theoretical model using a newly developed test rig. The development and features of this test rig are presented in this report. This experimental investigation also allowed the impact of those parameters that are difficult to control, to be determined. A total of three V-bands were used with different diameters but nominally identical cross sections were studied. In the research results, the initial slip point between flanges and the V-band clamp was identified by experimentation within this research project. Different sizes of Vbands were used under boundary conditions and loads. From the simulation results it was determned that the friction effect on the V-band depends {{on the size of the}} V-band. For the largest size of V-band, there was moderate correlation of the experimental and theoretical results. For the smallest size, the results suggest that with band tightening, flange contact is localised, rather than being throughout the band’s entire circumference. The research demonstrated the significant relevance of the band and flanges’ contact points and the coefficient of friction, especially that between the flanges, on the V-band clamp’s theoretical torsional load capacit...|$|R
