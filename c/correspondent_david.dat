25|$|Dec 19, 2006: According to CBS News report, the Pentagon is {{planning}} to bolster its presence in the Persian Gulf {{as a warning to}} Iran's continuously defiant government. CBS News national security <b>correspondent</b> <b>David</b> Martin says the U.S. military build-up, which would include adding a second aircraft carrier to the one already in the Gulf, is being proposed as a response to what U.S. officials view as an increasingly provocative Iranian leadership.|$|E
500|$|Nigel Winterburn {{were all}} on the scoresheet and the 5–0 victory opened up a six-point gap {{at the top of}} the table. The Guardian <b>correspondent</b> <b>David</b> Lacey opined that the {{combination}} play between Smith and Merson was [...] "crucial to Arsenal's momentum" [...] as was Rocastle's athleticism down the right. Martin Hayes made a rare start for Arsenal and crucially scored the winner against Middlesbrough, all but relegating the North-East side. The absence of Davis, out with an injury, was felt as Arsenal unexpectedly lost at home to Derby County. In their final home match of the season Arsenal were held to a 2–2 draw by Wimbledon, paving the way for Liverpool to leapfrog them into first place and move three points clear. With one game remaining, Arsenal's title chances were as good as over.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditionally}} strong journalistic bench of CBS News {{was changed}} in 1984 when new owner Lawrence Tisch oversaw layoffs {{of thousands of}} CBS News employees, including <b>correspondents</b> <b>David</b> Andelman, Fred Graham, Morton Dean and Ike Pappas. Fewer videotape crews were dispatched to cover stories and numerous bureaus were closed. This eventually caused CBS News to fall into third place in the ratings.|$|R

500|$|The deal {{attracted}} mass {{attention from}} the media. Neil Harman, then of the Daily Mail, questioned the power broadcasters and Premier League chairman now had over fixture scheduling. He concluded his piece with a warning: [...] "The game has already reached saturation coverage, now {{it is likely to}} be choked. Football on six days out of seven per week will be good for no-one." [...] The Independent noted that this was a [...] "remarkable coup" [...] for BSkyB, given the company's fluctuating fortunes. The Guardian <b>correspondent</b> <b>David</b> Lacey suggested that fans were the biggest losers: [...] "A lot of people who want to watch matches regularly in future are going to have to buy a bond or a dish." [...] Bryan Davies, Baron Davies of Oldham described the arrangement as [...] "absolutely appalling" [...] and Football Supporters' Association chairman Craig Brewin criticised the [...] "obscene" [...] amounts of money clubs earned as part of the deal.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal did {{not play}} another game for a {{fortnight}} because of the international football break. On the resumption of club football, they played Birmingham City away from home. As suspensions came into action and there were injuries to first-team players, Wenger was forced to reshuffle his team. Clichy was handed his full debut and Pascal Cygan made his first start of the season, partnering Campbell. Ljungberg opened the scoring for Arsenal inside four minutes and further goals by Bergkamp and Pirès ensured the team won their third straight match of November. By extending their unbeaten run {{from the start of}} the season to 13 league matches, Arsenal set a new Premier League record. They were then held by Fulham to a goalless draw who became the first team to deny Arsenal from scoring in 46 league matches at Highbury. The Guardian <b>correspondent</b> <b>David</b> Lacey summarised Arsenal's football on the day as [...] "strong in the string section but short on percussion" [...] and noted they reverted to the pattern of scoring a perfect goal, instead of being efficient. Chelsea's 1–0 win over Manchester United meant Arsenal moved down to second place on the final day of November.|$|E
500|$|Journalists and pundits {{reviewing}} the final praised Liverpool's tenacity; radio commentator Alan Green {{wrote in his}} News Letter column of 14 May 2001: [...] "Simply, they never give up {{and when you have}} a player like Michael Owen within your ranks you believe that any situation can be rescued, {{as it was in the}} magnificent Millennium Stadium." [...] The Guardian <b>correspondent</b> <b>David</b> Lacey declared [...] "The Owen of France '98 was reborn in Cardiff," [...] while Hugh McIlvanney of The Sunday Times called Owen [...] "the master executioner of English football." [...] McIlvanney felt over the 90 minutes the Arsenal team were [...] "unlucky to lose," [...] lauding Vieira's show in midfield. James Lawton's match report in The Independent was not as empathetic; although in praise of Henry's performance his indecision compared to Owen, demonstrated how [...] "effect, not style, is everything" [...] in football. Clive White of The Herald criticised Henry's lack of end product, using the final and Arsenal's European failure against Valencia to demonstrate how he would never be considered a [...] "natural goalscorer". Ron Atkinson, writing in his tactics column for The Guardian noted Liverpool's winning goal only came about because of Arsenal's eagerness to attack, which left gaps in defence.|$|E

2500|$|Vieira's {{performance}} against Charlton on 14 September 2002 – incidentally his 200th league appearance for Arsenal – [...] "justified Wenger's {{faith in}} his captain's fitness".

[...] Vieira sustained a groin injury against Valencia in December 2002, returning on Boxing Day to face West Bromwich Albion. In May 2003, Vieira was fined £2,300 by UEFA, having criticised the organisation for not doing enough on racism – the player was subject to racist abuse against Valencia. Vieira missed Arsenal's title run-in, which saw Manchester United overtake them in first place, due to sustaining a knee injury. Vieira was also ruled out of the 2003 FA Cup Final which Arsenal won, but jointly lifted the trophy with captain for the day, David Seaman.|$|E
50|$|The Camel News Caravan or Camel Caravan of News was a 15-minute American {{television}} news program aired by NBC News from February 14, 1949 to October 26, 1956. Sponsored by the Camel cigarette brand and anchored by John Cameron Swayze, {{it was the}} first NBC news program to use NBC filmed news stories rather than movie newsreels. On February 16, 1954, the Camel News Caravan became the first news program broadcast in color, making use of 16mm color film. In early 1955, the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, maker of Camel cigarettes, cut back its sponsorship to three days a week. Chrysler's Plymouth division sponsored the other days, and on those days, the program was labelled the Plymouth News Caravan. The program featured a young Washington <b>correspondent</b> named <b>David</b> Brinkley, and competed against Douglas Edwards with the News on rival CBS. With greater resources, the News Caravan attracted a larger audience than its CBS competition until 1955.|$|R
50|$|In 1968, Arledge was {{formally}} appointed {{as president of}} ABC Sports.

2500|$|On February 8, Clinton's Communications Director Howard Wolfson Clinton criticized MSNBC's <b>correspondent</b> <b>David</b> Shuster [...] "for {{suggesting}} the Clinton campaign had 'pimped out' 27-year old Chelsea by having her place {{phone calls to}} celebrities and Democratic Party 'superdelegates' on her mother's behalf." [...] Shuster apologized [...] "on the air" [...] and was temporarily suspended from the network. Wolfson argued that {{this was part of}} [...] "a pattern of tasteless comments by MSNBC anchors about the Clinton campaign" [...] and suggested that Clinton's participation in the scheduled, MSNBC-sponsored Cleveland debate could be jeopardized. The Clinton campaign agreed to continue with the debate after the apology was offered. In a February 12 interview with Chris Plante on WMAL-AM, [...] "former President Bill Clinton implied the media has been unfair to his wife, stated that she was standing up to sexism when she took on NBC, and -- when asked about MSNBC's David Shuster's comments about his daughter, Chelsea -- said there was a double standard." [...] Other critics have also argued that this incident {{was part of a larger}} pattern of [...] "sexist coverage." ...|$|E

This campaign involved organized groups of civilians, or kebeles, which within a month's time began to receive arms from the Derg. [...] "Contrary to expectations," [...] note researcher Marina Ottaway and then Washington Post <b>correspondent</b> <b>David</b> Ottaway in their account, [...] "these squads did not all side with the Derg or heed its call to track down 'reactionaries' and 'anarchists'. Rather, many followed their own whim and law, in accordance to the political faction that controlled each kebele or factory. Not only had numerous defense squads been infiltrated by the EPRP, but also those controlled by the Political Bureau were often bent on furthering the interests of MEISON rather than the Derg." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, Friendly was an {{experienced}} radio producer. It {{was in this}} role that Friendly first worked with Murrow on the Columbia Records historical albums, I Can Hear It Now. The first entry in the series, released on Thanksgiving Day 1948, covered the crisis and war years 1933–1945. It was a ground-breaker in that it used clips of radio news coverage and speeches of the major events from that twelve-year time span. Friendly created the concept after noticing the new use of audiotape in regular radio news coverage, as opposed to wire or disc recordings that had been an industry standard. Periodically, Friendly created recordings of news events when such recordings didn't exist or, recreated ones that were considered too chaotic to use on an album [...] CBS <b>correspondent</b> <b>David</b> Schoenbrun, in his memoir On and Off the Air, said he once was forced by Friendly to ask Charles de Gaulle if he would recreate the speech he gave upon his return to Paris (de Gaulle refused). The recreations never were identified as such, and trying to separate the real from the recreated, continues to be problematic for radio historians.|$|E

50|$|Smyth's {{theories}} {{were later}} expanded upon by early 20th century British Israelites such as Colonel Garnier (Great Pyramid: Its Builder & Its Prophecy, 1905), {{who began to}} theorise that chambers within the Great Pyramid contain prophetic dates which concern {{the future of the}} British, Celtic, or Anglo-Saxon peoples. However this idea originated with Robert Menzies, an earlier <b>correspondent</b> of Smyth's. <b>David</b> Davidson with H. Aldersmith wrote The Great Pyramid, Its Divine Message (1924) and further introduced the idea that Britain's chronology (including future events) may be unlocked from inside the Great Pyramid. This theme is also found in Basil Stewart's trilogy on the same subject: Witness of the Great Pyramid (1927), The Great Pyramid, Its Construction, Symbolism and Chronology (1931) and History and Significance of the Great Pyramid... (1935). More recently a four-volume set entitled Pyramidology was published by British Israelite Adam Rutherford (released between 1957-1972). British Israelite author E. Raymond Capt also wrote Great Pyramid Decoded in 1971 followed by Study in Pyramidology in 1986.|$|R
2500|$|In 1958, Brando {{appeared}} in The Young Lions, dyeing his hair blonde and assuming a German accent for the role, which he later admitted was not convincing. The film {{is based on}} the novel by Irwin Shaw, and Brando's portrayal of the character Christian Diestl was controversial for its time. He later wrote, [...] "The original script closely followed the book, in which Shaw painted all Germans as evil caricatures, especially Christian, whom he portrayed as a symbol of everything that was bad about Nazism; he was mean, nasty, vicious, a cliché of evil... I thought the story should demonstrate that there are no inherently 'bad' people in the world, but they can easily be misled." [...] Shaw and Brando even appeared together for a televised interview with CBS <b>correspondent</b> <b>David</b> Schoenbrun and, during a bombastic exchange, Shaw charged that, like most actors, Brando was incapable of playing flat-out villainy; Brando responded by stating [...] "Nobody creates a character but an actor. I play the role; now he exists. He is my creation." [...] The Young Lions also features Brando's only appearance in a film with friend and rival Montgomery Clift (although they shared no scenes together). Brando closed out the decade by appearing in The Fugitive Kind (1960) opposite Anna Magnani. The film was based on another play by Tennessee Williams but was hardly the success A Streetcar Named Desire had been, with the Los Angeles Times labeling Williams's personae [...] "psychologically sick or just plain ugly" [...] and The New Yorker calling it a [...] "cornpone melodrama".|$|E
