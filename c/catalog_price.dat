50|$|The {{resulting}} {{houses were}} indistinguishable in quality and appearance from those built by traditional methods, if not better, yet were often significantly cheaper to build {{because of the}} savings on carpenters' and contractors' wages; {{and the cost of}} high-quality lumber bought from a large kit house company often was lower than at the local lumber yard. In addition, some companies, including Sears, Montgomery Ward, Gordon-Van Tine, and Harris Brothers, offered cash discounts and generous mortgage terms. For most homeowners, the complete cost of building a kit house was about double the <b>catalog</b> <b>price,</b> allowing {{for the construction of a}} foundation and labor costs.

50|$|FAR 2.101 {{provides}} that“a commercial item means - (6) {{services of}} a type offered and sold competitively in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace based on established catalog or market prices for specific tasks performed or specific outcomes to be achieved and under standard commercial terms and conditions. This does not include services that are sold based on hourly rates without an established catalog or market price for a specific service performed or specific outcomes to be achieved. For purposes of these services -(i)catalog price means a price included in a <b>catalog,</b> <b>price</b> list, schedule or other form that is regularly maintained by the manufacturer or vendor, is either published or otherwise available for inspection by customers and states prices at which sales are currently, or were last, made to {{a significant number of}} buyers constituting the general public; and(ii) Market prices means current prices that are established in the course of ordinary trade between buyers and sellers free to bargain and that can be substantiated through competition or from sources independent of the offerors."Note the emphasis in the FAR 2.101 definition for commercial items on established market prices. The reason why simplified acquisition is permitted for items above the $100,000 simplified acquisition procedure threshold for commercial items is there is an efficient market pricing mechanism which pressures market participants to provide goods and services at a fair and reasonable price which represents very efficient / non-wasteful pricing mechanisms. Generally, the more efficient and well developed markets have a large number of participating vendors and information is freely available to consumers in that market on the relative merits of each vendor's products and pricing which permits easy comparison of each vendor's products to each other. FAR Part 12 commercial items acquisition authority was intended {{to take advantage of the}} WalMart's (R) and Microsoft's (R) of the world where there is no need to go through the extensive, formalistic and resource/time consuming process of a fully negotiated procurement, which requires vendors provide cost and pricing information, to verify a fair and reasonable price. In other words, FAR Part 12 was intended to increase the number of competitors available to the US Government by jettisoning all of the unique requirements, including cost accounting systems, which are forced upon Federal contractors by acquisition processes such as FAR Parts 14, 15, 36 etc.; instead, the Federal Government could act more like a normal buyer in a fully functioning commercial market where the Government was but one of a large number of consumers seeking the same or highly similar products or services. However, FAR Part 12 was never intended to apply where the US Government was the only or one of a very few buyers for an item or service not in demand by the commercial market place.|$|E

40|$|For {{the past}} 15 years, {{there has been}} a tacit {{expectation}} among many health policymakers that the financing of childhood immunizations would be a shared responsibility of the private and public sectors. Employers and private health insurance would cover the costs of immunizing children of workers, and the federal and state governments would be responsible for financing the immunizations of low-income uninsured and underinsured children, as well as children covered by Medicaid. Until 15 years ago, the costs of immunizing a child were relatively low. In 1987, the combined <b>catalog</b> <b>price</b> of all childhood vaccines was $ 116; ten years later, the total price was between $ 332 and $ 370 (IOM, Calling the Shots, p. 57). Since 1985, the number of recommended childhood vaccines has doubled, helping to drive the total price of the recommended vaccines up. The rising costs and number of current childhood vaccines have raised concern that the shared private-public responsibility for childhood immunizations may be shifting from a 50 - 50 split to one where the private sector is reducing its commitment to financing immunizations. This concern has been partly fueled by anecdotal stories related to the recent shortages of vaccine supplies to private and public providers. The anecdotes describe physicians in privat...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Managed care {{organizations}} (MCOs) joined {{local and state}} public health agencies in a pilot effort to improve hepatitis B immunization rates of adolescents in an urban and a suburban/rural school district. The pilot also explored issues inherent {{in public and private}} collaboration on population health improvement. Local public health agencies provided links to schools in their communities, took the lead in implementing school-based immunization programs, and provided health education materials. MCOs contributed financial support necessary for the project. The final cost per fully vaccinated student, not taking into account the work group 2 ̆ 7 s planning and coordination time, was little more than the <b>catalog</b> <b>price</b> of the vaccine alone. Managed {{care organizations}} face challenges that complicate their participation and funding of school-based vaccinations: 1) Limited data on health plans of participating students complicate allocation of costs to each MCO; 2) Double-paying occurs for MCOs paying clinics a monthly, per-member rate that already includes adolescent immunizations; 3) When schools provide adolescent immunizations, MCOs lose the “hook” that draws adolescents to clinics for comprehensive health services. When self-consenting is permitted, schools can achieve a high consent and completion rates for multi-dose adolescent immunizations such as hepatitis B. At the same time, MCOs have the responsibility to provide members with comprehensive care and should continue to examine both internal modifications and external partnerships as opportunities to improve their services to adolescents...|$|E

The subjects were also investigated in terms of demographics and socioeconomic status in an attempt to find reasons why they prefer to shop from catalogs as opposed to retail stores, or why they prefer to shop from retail stores as opposed to catalogs. One hundred and thirty-one women were surveyed. Sixty-nine were employed and working in downtown Chicago, and 62 were unemployed and living in DeKalb, Illinois. The data were analyzed by t-tests and analysis of variance. The findings indicated that catalog shoppers are risk takers in that they do not consider getting money back, fit of clothing, merchandise quality, or waiting time a problem when ordering from a catalog. The unemployed non-catalog shoppers were least likely to order from a catalog in that they are concerned about incurring a financial loss {{as a result of a}} <b>catalog's</b> <b>prices.</b> The unemployed respondents spend a great deal of time with their families, and consider television their primary source of entertainment.

(Isn’t this what librarians inevitably do with other librarian’s lists anyway?) Space limitations preclude the inclusion of detailed descriptions, annotations and commentary; the user can find these details in the producer’s catalogs, a collection of which is essential to nonprint selection. The subject groupings correspond to common elementary science curricular areas, and naturally there is some overlapping. In general, sets of materials rather than individual items are listed (1) to save space and thus include more items, and (2) because audiovisual materials are generally purchased this way (although often cataloged, housed and circulated as individual items).

40|$|During {{the past}} 20 years liver {{transplantation}} {{has become the}} definitive treatment for most severe types of liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma, in both children and adults. In the U. S., roughly 16, 000 individuals are on the liver transplant waiting list. Only 38 % of them will receive a transplant due to the organ shortage. This paper explores another option: bioengineering an autologous liver graft. We developed a 20 -year model projecting future demand for liver transplants, along with costs based on current technology. We compared these cost projections against projected costs to bioengineer autologous liver grafts. The model was divided into: 1) the epidemiology model forecasting the number of wait-listed patients, operated patients and postoperative patients; and 2) the treatment model forecasting costs (pre-transplant-related costs; transplant (admission) -related costs; and 10 -year post-transplant-related costs) during the simulation period. The patient population was categorized using the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score. The number of patients {{on the waiting list}} was projected to increase 23 % over 20 years while the weighted average treatment costs in the pre-liver transplantation phase were forecast to increase 83 % in Year 20. Projected demand for livers will increase 10 % in 10 years and 23 % in 20 years. Total costs of liver transplantation are forecast to increase 33 % in 10 years and 81 % in 20 years. By comparison, the projected cost to bioengineer autologous liver grafts is $ 9. 7 M based on current <b>catalog</b> <b>prices</b> for iPS-derived liver cells. The model projects a persistent increase in need and cost of donor livers over the next 20 years that’s constrained by a limited supply of donor livers. The number of patients who die while on the waiting list will reflect this ever-growing disparity. Currently, bioengineering autologous liver grafts is cost prohibitive. However, costs will decline rapidly with the introduction of new manufacturing strategies and economies of scale...|$|R
