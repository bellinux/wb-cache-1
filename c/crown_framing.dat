40|$|Statement of Problem: A general {{process in}} implant design is to {{determine}} the reason of possible problems and to find the relevant solutions. The success of the implant depends on the control technique of implant biomechanical conditions. Objectives: The goal {{of this study was to}} evaluate the influence of both abutment and framework materials on the stress of the bone around the implant by using threedimensional finite element analysis. Materials and Methods: A three-dimensional model of a patient’s premaxillary bone was fabricated using Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT). Then, three types of abutment from gold, nickel-chromium and zirconia and also three types of <b>crown</b> <b>frame</b> from silver-palladium, nickel-chromium and zirconia were designed. Finally, a 178 N force at angles of zero, 30 and 45 degrees was exerted on the implant axis and the maximum stress and strain in the trabecular, cortical bones and cement was calculated. Results: With changes of the materials and mechanical properties of abutment and frame, little difference was observed in the level and distribution pattern of stress. The stress level was increased with the rise in the angle of pressure exertion. The highest stress concentration was related to the force at the angle of 45 degrees. The results of the cement analysis proved an inverse relationship between the rate of elastic modulus of the frame material and that of the maximum stress in the cement. Conclusions: The impact of the angle at which the force was applied was more significant in stress distribution than that of abutment and framework core materials...|$|R

The ornamentation is moderate; the massing is well balanced and the symmetrical movement of the columns and openings are almost neoclassic. The facade is divided by single and coupled Doric columns in three segments, and is dominated by large semi-circular arches of the openings in the first level, and the smaller ones superimposed on the second level which are alternately semicircular and segmented. The triangular pediment strongly outlined by heavily projecting broken cornices is topped by a sort of acroteria {{in the center and}} torch-like finials. A statued niche flanked by fluted pilasters topped by a segmented canopy <b>crowns</b> the silted <b>frame</b> of the center window. Triglypha decorate the frieze and a stylized Augustinian emblem decorates the center of pediment.

This included the restoration of deteriorated elements of the architecture of the building: expanding the rooms, transforming the basement into a library/archive, and dividing the pantry space into two washrooms. On the first floor a metal staircase was installed in the east wing and the attic was expanded, particularly in the north section. Attempts were made to restore the ceiling paintings (in the gold hall, dining room, music room and gallery), in addition to ceramic panels and dining room light fixture, a work by Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro. Other repairs included painting the walls, doors and window frames and restoration of the decorative stucco on the ceilings and the <b>crown</b> moulding. <b>Frames</b> and awnings of the old games room were replaced and the patio around the palácio was repaved. Meanwhile, landscape architect Luisa Ferraz (commissioned by the Lisbon city council) began to restore the plant species, and re-establish the paths and circulatory routes, based on the old photographs of Beau-Séjour. At the same time, the small building constructed by the Marist Brothers was demolished (thereby leaving the small fern-encircled waterfall unrestricted), while the doorway to the Estrada de Benfica in the wall was unblocked. In 1992, the GEO occupied and installed their offices in the building following extensive renovation work.|$|R

40|$|The {{political}} {{economies of}} the oil rich GCC countries are generally contextualized {{within the framework of}} rentier state theory. The picture the theory portrays is that of an autonomous state with abundant revenues generated from oil which are in turn distributed to the larger population to gain political legitimacy within prevailing non-democratic cultures. Albeit having a democratically elected parliament with a vibrant political environment for a comparatively long time, rentierism is also applied to the political economy of Kuwait. This study, hence, aims to explore the development of Kuwait into a rentier constitutional state beyond the generally accepted notions put forward by rentier state theory. Its focus is to understand the perceptions and ideas behind the economic and political policy decisions {{in the context of the}} oil boom of the 1950 s and early 1960 s. Economically, therefore, the main aim is to explore and critically analyze why distributive policies, which constitute a main feature characterizing the country’s economy, were initiated in the post-oil era. The study also critically analyzes the diverse influences oil had on the concurrent rise in political activity and direction towards democratization, <b>crowned</b> by the <b>framing</b> of the constitution in 1962. In examining these developments, the study stresses the importance of looking not only at internal factors, but also at foreign and international influences that are brought about by oil booms. In the case of Kuwait, these include the primary role Britain played, in light of its oil interests, in the country’s internal affairs, and the ways in which oil sparked, for a small and newly rich Arab state, international dynamics that shaped the thinking of policymakers as to the importance of undertaking certain crucial reforms. An examination of the relevant archival record makes it is clear that the framework provided by rentier state theory is insufficient in capturing the complex factors that influence the economic and political decisions of policymakers in countries experiencing oil booms. The findings, therefore, challenge rentier state theory’s core assumptions, such as its stress on ‘political utility’ as the main, if not sole, driver of socioeconomic policy, and the ‘materialistic approach’ in which political activity is contextualized. The study shows that much of the socioeconomic policies that created what is referred to as a ‘distributive state’ stemmed from much deeper influences than those postulated by the theory, such as certain perceptions of tradition and culture; views of citizen ‘rights’ and social justice in a specific historical context; and influences of social currents overtaking the region at the time. Furthermore, the study demonstrates how, in the period concerned, contrary to the position of the rentier state literature, oil played a significant role in the democratization of Kuwait, transforming it from a primitive patriarchal autocracy to a modern ‘rentier constitutional state’. The latter embodies, as the study argues, the concept of a rentier state combined with a constitutional form of government in which citizens are directly involved in the economic and political decision-making process. The study concludes that Eurocentric theoretical frameworks as expressed in rentier state theory may not always be sufficient in explaining the complex realities of countries such as Kuwait. There is a need, therefore, for a new approach that engages directly with the internal and external dynamics of individual countries in order to understand their respective political economies beyond assumptions imported largely from foreign experiences. ...|$|R
