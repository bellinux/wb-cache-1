50|$|The neighourhood's first {{residents}} were largely Irish and Anglo-Saxon, followed eventually by immigrants of Eastern European origin. In the 2006 Census of Canada, 10.7% of immigrants identified {{their place of}} Origin as the United Kingdom, 11.4% said Polish, and 9.6% said Ukrainian. 18.8% of residents (omitting those whose first language was English or French) identified Ukrainian as their first language. This {{is the most common}} non-official language spoken in the neighbourhood. This census estimated the number of residents within the neighbourhood as 9,565. 37% are between the ages of 30 to 49, 26% between the ages of 0 to 19, 11% between the ages of 20-29 and 15% are 60+. From the total population only 13% of the residents do not belong to a <b>census</b> <b>family.</b> This indicates that one of the main characteristics of Bloor West is that it is largely made up of young families.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Family {{planning}} programmes {{initiated in}} the Islamic Republic of Iran from 1966 met with limited success. Following the 1986 <b>census</b> <b>family</b> planning {{was considered a}} priority and {{was supported by the}} country’s leaders. Appropriate strategies based on the principles of health promotion led to an increase in the contraceptive prevalence rate among married women from 49. 0 % in 1989 to 73. 8 % in 2006. This paper reviews the family planning programmes in the Islamic Republic of Iran and their achievements during the last 4 decades and discusses the principles of health promotion and theories of behaviour change which may explain these achievements. Successful strategies included: creation of a supportive environment, reorientation of family planning services, expanding of coverage of family planning services, training skilled personnel, providing free contraceptives as well as vasectomy and tubectomy services, involvement of volunteers and nongovernmenta...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{very large}} {{literature}} that examines the relationship between health and income. Two main hypotheses have been investigated: the income inequality hypothesis and the absolute income hypothesis. Most of previous studies that used mortality data have been criticized for estimating an aggregate model that does not account for non-linear links between health and income at the individual level. In this paper we follow a novel approach to avoid this bias, combining aggregate mortality data with individual-level data on socio-economic characteristics. We test the income inequality and absolute income hypotheses using county-level mortality data from Life Statistic of Department of Health and individual-level data from Taiwan <b>census</b> <b>Family</b> Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) for 1976 - 2004. We find the evidence to support the absolute income hypothesis but not income inequality hypothesis {{in the case of the}} general population. We also find strong evidence that education does have significant effects on individuals' health and the estimates are not sensitive to income equivalent scales.

40|$|Registration as a {{statistical}} operation, reveals the real {{situation of the}} population in a certain time and serves as a base to conduct further demographic assessments by using the data on natural increment and migration balance. A Census is real picture of the territory of a country expressing the real situation over everything that deals with numbers and statistics of a country. In 2011, from the date 1 - 30 th of April, Kosovo realized its first <b>census,</b> <b>family</b> economies and dwellings after 20 years. After the independence of Republic of Kosovo in 2008, the census was considered to have been the most important event and the most serious project of Kosovo institutions toward international obligations. The Kosovo Census has been a long journey toward its realization. Preparations for this registration started in 2003 and ended in year 2011. After the realization of the population census, many debates were initiated regarding its success and if the process had failed in different cities of Kosovo. The most contested issue was the case with Municipality of Prishtina, where the number of registered inhabitants was lower than expected, and as a result, it was questioned by the expert expectations for demography...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays {{the most}} {{affordable}} means to bring wide band connectivity to rural areas {{is represented by}} wireless technology, which guarantees flexibility, scalability, ease of installation and low investments. Wireless technology in the unlicensed bands presents some disadvantages, when intended to cover large areas. Commercial operators indeed might deploy wireless networks in digital-divided areas exploiting licensed bands or hybrid configurations where the backhaul is realized by high performance licensed links. In the recent years, several Wireless Community Networks have been created and grown all over Europe, with some relevant cases represented by the deployments in Athens, Barcelona, Vienna. A Wireless Community Network is created by citizens interested to exchange knowledge, contacts and information on a transversal infrastructure, thanks {{to the use of}} wireless equipment working in the unlicensed frequency spectrum. As a matter of fact, such experiences must be started by skilled people, living in places characterized by dense urbanization. Wireless Community Networks could be regarded as a means to overcome the digital dived in countryside, but exporting a Wireless Community Network in rural areas is difficult because of lack of technical skills, and economic conditions not comparable to those found in a big city. In this contest, the research work has been dedicated to support the startup and consolidation of a social-based wireless network operator in a rural quasi-remote area. The idea is to realize network infrastructures capable to reduce the infrastructural digital divide, create technical skills and increase the digital culture of the population, with a low economic effort compared to what should be spent to commercial operators. Technologically speaking, the most efficient and affordable solution is represented by the exploitation of Wi-Fi technology. The latest version of the IEEE 802. 11 standard offers exceptional possibilities in terms of throughput and latency, even if regulatory limitations and interferences may lower down the capabilities of the network, especially when it is intended to cover large areas. For this reason, a model for a managed deployment has been identified. The model has been realized following two major criteria. The first one is an efficient reuse of frequency channels and the protection from interferences in order to provide a good coverage of the territory taking into account the presence of self-generated and external noise. The second one is an efficient algorithm for channel access. Its goal is to avoid redundancy, minimize the latency and increase the throughput. This has been achieved through an hybrid system that accesses the channel with a combination of contention-free and contention-based protocols. The alternation between the two is based on the traffic load in the network. This model has been applied to a Wireless Community Network, that has been modified from an earlier version based in a single municipality (16 km 2) where six base stations were mounting a total of 13 radios, to reach a dimension of 115 base stations with 346 radios, covering to 45 municipalities over 646 km 2. The system alternates 11 channels offering consistent download and upload throughputs (12 Mbps and 8 Mbps respectively). This network is managed by an association for social promotion "Senza Fili Senza Confini", the first non-profit Internet Service Provider in Italy, which nowadays counts 2842 members, without any saturation or bottleneck. Senza Fili Senza Confini is a successful project, where the growth of the members' number has been statistically analyzed: it has been noticed that the subscription rate depends on the number of families of each village. Municipality counting less than 250 <b>census</b> <b>families</b> exhibit a 7 % of the <b>census</b> <b>families</b> subscription at the first month and a constant subscription rate of 0. 9 % per month. Whereas, if the municipality counts more than 250 <b>census</b> <b>families</b> the subscriptions at first month are 4 % of the <b>census</b> <b>families</b> and the average subscription rate is of 0. 7 % per month...|$|R
