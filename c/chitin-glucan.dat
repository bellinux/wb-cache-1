50|$|<b>Chitin-glucan</b> complex {{consists}} of chitin, 1,3/1,6-ß-D-glucan, and melanin. Rather than being produced from animal parts, the chitin {{used for this}} purpose is extracted from the cell walls of the fungus Fomes fomentarius. Unlike chitin extracted from crustaceans, for example, this chitin contains no heavy metals. It possesses immunostimulant properties.|$|E
40|$|<b>Chitin-glucan</b> is an {{insoluble}} biopolymer, {{composed of}} chitin and beta-(1, 3) -d-glucan, {{that is a}} component of the fungal cell wall. This study was conducted to assess the safety of <b>chitin-glucan</b> from the mycelium of Aspergillus niger (Artinia™ brand) for use as dietary supplement and food ingredient. <b>Chitin-glucan</b> was fed to Wistar rats (20 /sex/group) at dietary levels of 0, 1, 5 and 10 % for 13. weeks. Clinical and neurobehavioural observations, growth, feed and water consumption, ophthalmoscopy, haematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, organ weights, necropsy and histopathological examination revealed no adverse effects of <b>chitin-glucan.</b> Rats fed <b>chitin-glucan</b> at 10 % consumed more feed than controls, probably due to lower energy density of their diet. Water intake was increased slightly at all dose levels. These changes were not toxicologically significant. Full and empty caecum weights were increased in mid-dose males and high-dose males and females. This caecal enlargement was a physiological response to the consumption of a high amount of poorly digestible carbohydrate and considered of no toxicological concern. In conclusion, feeding <b>chitin-glucan</b> at dietary levels up to 10 % for 13. weeks was tolerated without any signs of toxicity. This level corresponded to 6. 6 and 7. 0. g chitin-glucan/kg body weight/day in male and female rats, respectively. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{a great deal}} of {{attention}} has been paid to the use of Aspergillus niger biomass- the product of citric acid- as a raw material source of chitin. However, the difficulty lies in the fact that chitin in cell walls of fungi Aspergillus niger is covalently bonded with glucans, which can be completely separated by means of enzymes only. <b>Chitin-glucan</b> complex obtained contains about 15 - 20 % glucan, but its presence results in important changes of consumer product qualities in comparison with chitin shells of crustaceans. So, chitosan-glucan complex, produced by deacetylation of <b>chitin-glucan,</b> exhibits smaller solubility in weak organic acids. The aim of this work is to obtain soluble derivatives of <b>chitin-glucan</b> complex by means of chemical modifications of its hydroxyl groups. As a result of interactions of <b>chitin-glucan</b> complex with propylene oxide, alkyls halide, dimethyl sulphate and acetic oxide, the derivatives of <b>chitin-glucan</b> complex and chitosan-glucan complex have been obtained. They possess a broad spectrum of solubility. Research of these compounds had shown that in all cases, excepting interaction with benzyl chloride, the derivatives with the degree of substitution 2 are obtained. In the reactions o...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of the}} biomass of Aspergillus niger fungus- a {{producer}} of a citric acid as a raw source of chitin, demands carrying out a thorough investigation {{of the structure of}} <b>chitin-glucan</b> complex (ChGC), in the form of which chitin is present in the cellular wall of this fungus. The objective of the present work is to reveal the characteristic features of hydrolysis of ChGC by the concentrated acids. By hydrolysis of <b>chitin-glucan</b> and chitosan-glucan complexes in concentrated hydrochloric and 55 % sulfuric acids {{it has been shown that}} degradation of these polymers results in isolation of ammonia and formation of D-glucosamine, glucose, fructose, acetic acid, as well as chitooligosacharides and aminoacid fragments. Detection of D-glucosamine, glucose, and fructose in hydrolysates was carried out with the use thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on silica plates "Silufol " in various systems of solvents. As a result it has been revealed that: • in the products of ChGC hydrolysis the intensity of fructose stain is insignificant as compared to the intensity of glucose stain...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Corneocyte {{accumulation}} (hyperkeratosis, xerosis) commonly {{occurs in}} the stratum corneum (SC) of the feet of diabetic patients, as well as menopausal women. OBJECTIVE: To compare {{the effects of a}} 2. 5 % <b>chitin-glucan</b> formulation with its placebo, and commercially available glycerol formulations. METHODS: This two-step controlled double-blind, randomized, intra-individual study was performed in 30 type 1 and 2 diabetic menopausal women suffering from xerosis of the feet. The formulations were applied once daily for 3 weeks. Electrometric assessments were performed on three sites of the feet at entry in the study, at weekly intervals during the treatment phase, and in a 2 -week follow-up out of treatment. Positive controls consisted in two commercially available formulations enriched in glycerol. RESULTS: Data revealed an unequivocal benefit provided by the 2. 5 % <b>chitin-glucan</b> formulation compared with placebo. The electrometric values were significantly higher at each evaluation time during both treatment and follow-up phases. The two glycerol-enriched formulations showed slightly different kinetics of SC moisturization. A steep increase was followed by a plateau level and a rapid decline after stopping the treatments. CONCLUSION: The increased moisturization of the SC of the sole probably improves the desquamation process and reduces xerosis of the soles. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Two novel {{processes}} {{based on}} ionic liquid methodology, including steps {{to recover the}} ionic liquids for reuse and recycle, are developed for the recovery of key value components from food wastes: namely glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) from seafood waste (scallop gut) and <b>chitin-glucan</b> complexes from cider yeast wastes. Both these components are high-added value materials in nutraceuticals and the chitin- glucan complexes are of particular interest because they are recovered from a vegetarian source. GAG recovery from scallop gut involves treatment of the wet waste with the ionic liquid, HBetNTf 2, in a low temperature (30 oC) process to separate the insoluble GAG mixture from other components of the waste, which are soluble. The important aspects of this process {{from the point of}} view of economic viability are: (i) it is a low-temperature process, (ii) the extraction of the unwanted components occurs quickly, (iii) the product GAGs are obtained in good yield, and (iv) all solvents used can be recovered. The recovery of <b>chitin-glucan</b> involves enzymatic pre-treatment of the cider yeast waste to give a digested pellet from which the complex can be recovered by treatment with the IL, BMIMCl. Two low temperature ionic liquid processes (TESA/TESAC and P 6, 6, 6, 14 Cl) for re-refining waste lubricant oils to recover base oils, of sufficient quality to be reused in lubricant applications, are also developed. The TESA/TESAC process is based on a reversible reaction from a solvent, TESA, in which the base oil is soluble to an ionic liquid, TESAC in which the base oil is insoluble. The conversion occurs when carbon dioxide is passed through the solvent and reversed by heating above 50 oC. In the P 6, 6, 6, 14 Cl process the base oils are recovered from a direct solution of the hydrocarbon content of the waste in the ionic liquid. In both processes all solvents used can be recovered for reuse. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|Purified <b>chitin-glucan</b> complex (CGC(pure)) was {{extracted}} from Komagataella pastoris biomass using a hot alkaline treatment, followed by neutralization and repeated washing with deionized water. The copolymer thus obtained had a beta-glucan:chitin molar ratio of 75 : 25 and low protein and inorganic salts contents (3. 0 and 0. 9 wt%, respectively). CGC(pure) {{had an average}} molecular weight of 4. 9 x 10 (5) Da with a polydispersity index of 1. 7, and a crystallinity index of 50 %. Solid-state NMR provided structural insight at the co-polymer. X-ray diffraction suggests that CGC(pure) has alpha-chitin in its structure. CGC(pure) presented an endothermic decomposition peak at 315 degrees C, assigned to the degradation of the saccharide structures. This study revealed that K. pastoris CGC has properties similar to other chitinous biopolymers and may represent an attractive alternative to crustacean chitin derived-products, being a reliable raw material {{for the development of}} new/improved pharmaceutical, cosmetic or food products.

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{regeneration}} of soft tissues, wound coatings were developed, containing nanofibres, different in composition and functional features. The work concentrates on chitosan and composite scaffolds containing chitosan. Porous nanofiber materials based on chitosan {{are the most}} promising nanofibers for the regeneration of soft tissues. Chitosan exhibits pH-sensitive behavior due to {{the large number of}} amino groups on its chains, which makes chitosan nanofibers promising carriers for the delivery of macromolecules. To increase the efficiency and accelerate the regeneration of soft tissues, nanofibers are functionalized with bioactive substances of various types: antimicrobial, analgesic, growth factors, etc., as well as functional polymers. To stabilize nanofibers and to improve the physical characteristics, treatment using glutaraldehyde, glyoxal, genipin or heat treatment are used. Chitosan is used to inhibit fibroplasia during wound healing and to promote tissue growth and differentiation in tissue culture. The efficiency of antibacterial activity of <b>chitin-glucan</b> complex with nanofibers for wound healing was shown. Reconstruction of deeper wounds, in which skin and soft tissues are damaged, requires measures for spatial reconstruction and stimulation of regeneration processes in the [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The GDP-mannose {{transporter}} gene VRG 4 {{has been}} identified {{from a number of}} yeasts including Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The vrg 4 - 2 allele of the GDP-mannose transporter of S. cerevisiae has been primarily characterized as having general phenotypes affecting glycosylation. In this study, vrg 4 - 2 was characterized, specifically with regard to defects in cell wall biosynthesis. The cell wall in vrg 4 - 2 mutants was found to be profoundly compromised, as measured by the spheroplast lysis assay. These mutant cells exhibited increased sensitivity to Congo red which is believed to interfere with <b>chitin-glucan</b> assembly in the cell wall. An increased level of cell wall fluorescence was also observed when the cells were incubated with Calcofluor white suggesting an increased level of chitin in the wall. Despite these apparent major alterations in the cell wall, the vrg 4 - 2 mutants exhibited near normal growth relative to the wild-type. All together, these results suggest that vrg 4 - 2 mutation affects the cell wall structure, but less so in general cellular metabolism...|$|E
40|$|The {{maintenance}} of cell wall integrity in fungi {{is required for}} normal cell growth, division, hyphae formation, and antifungal tolerance. We observed that endoplasmic reticulum stress regulated cell wall integrity in Candida glabrata, which possesses uniquely evolved mechanisms for unfolded protein response mechanisms. Tetracycline-mediated suppression of KRE 5, which encodes a predicted UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, significantly increased cell wall chitin content and decreased cell wall β- 1, 6 -glucan content. KRE 5 repression induced endoplasmic reticulum stress-related gene expression and MAP kinase pathway activation, including Slt 2 p and Hog 1 p phosphorylation, through the cell wall integrity signaling pathway. Moreover, the calcineurin pathway negatively regulated cell wall integrity, but not the reduction of β- 1, 6 -glucan content. These results indicate that KRE 5 is required for maintaining both endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis and cell wall integrity, and that the calcineurin pathway acts as a regulator of <b>chitin-glucan</b> balance in the cell wall and as an alternative mediator of endoplasmic reticulum stress in C. glabrata...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEctomycorrhizal mycelial necromass is an {{important}} source of carbon for free-living microorganisms in forest soils, yet we know little either of its fate when it enters soil or of the identity of microbes that are able to utilise mycelium as their energy source. Here we used 13 C-labelled mycelium of the ectomycorrhizal fungus Pisolithus microcarpus in laboratory incubations in combination with DNA-stable isotope probing (SIP) to determine the identity of functionally active soil fungi that can utilise dead mycelium. We also used solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to detect parallel changes in the abundance of key biochemical constituents of soil. A decrease in bulk soil 13 C concentration together with rapid loss of glycogen and <b>chitin-glucan</b> during the 4 week incubations suggested that dead mycelium was rapidly turned over. Further, 13 C was incorporated into fungal DNA within 7 days of addition to soil. DNA-SIP also revealed a dynamic community of functionally active soil fungi. By applying DNA-SIP and NMR in parallel, our data show that carbon from decaying ectomycorrhizal mycelium is rapidly transformed and incorporated into free-living soil fungi. This finding emphasises that dead extra-matrical mycelium is {{an important}} source of labile carbon for soil microorganisms...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{provided}} {{new evidence that}} alterations {{in the composition of}} the gut microbiota [...] known as dysbiosis [...] participate in the development of obesity. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the ability of <b>chitin-glucan</b> (CG) from a fungal source to modulate both the gut microbiota and glucose and lipid metabolism in high-fat (HF) diet-induced obese mice. Supplementation of the HF diet with fungal CG (10 % w/w) induced caecal enlargement with prominent changes in gut microbiota: it restored the number of bacteria from clostridial cluster XIVa including Roseburia spp., which were decreased due to HF feeding. Furthermore, CG treatment significantly decreased HF-induced body weight gain, fat mass development, fasting hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, hepatic triglyceride accumulation and hypercholesterolemia, independently of the caloric intake. All those parameters were negatively correlated with specific bacteria of clostridial cluster XIVa, i. e., Roseburia spp. (Pearson's correlations analysis). In contrast to prebiotics that more specifically target the bifidobacteria species, CG effects on obesity appear to be independent of the incretin glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP- 1) production, since portal GLP- 1 and proglucagon (its precursor) expression were not modified by the dietary intervention. In conclusion, our findings support the view that chronic consumption of CG has potential beneficial effects with respect to the development of obesity and associated metabolic diabetes and hepatic steatosis, through a mechanism related to the restoration of the composition and/or the activity of gut bacteria, namely, bacteria from clostridial cluster XIVa...|$|E
40|$|The Entomophthorales {{were studied}} to {{determine}} whether a new criterion could be introduced into their scheme of classification to help clarify some of the synonymy within the group. An attempt was also made to see if differences in the cell wall carbohydrates showed any correlation with the differences in mycelial lipids within the group. It was also desirable {{to find out if the}} Entomophthorales were of similar cell wall composition to the Mucorales, and if not to which chemical category they should be assigned. [...] Several media were tested to see which one supported the best fungal growth, and several extraction techniques were tested to see which gave the most useful cell wall preparations free of cytoplasm. The efficiency of the cell wall extractions was determined histochemically. [...] A histochemical study of the cell wall was made to provide qualitative data on the constituent polysaccharides in the cell walls. Further qualitative data was gained by hydrolysing the cell walls and analysing by chromatography the monosaccharides so released. Quantitative data were gathered by analysing the hydrolysates by colourimetric techniques. [...] It was shown as a result of this study that qualitative differences occur between the genera tested, and that quantitative differences occur between the species of one genus. The glucose: mannose ratio is the most useful taxonomic criterion at the species level, as it remains constant on a variety of media. [...] The sub-grouping of the Entomophthorales by their lipid composition seems to be reflected in the cell wall carbohydrate composition. [...] The Entomophthorales should not be classed chemically with the Mucorales; they should be separated into a category of <b>chitin-glucan</b> fungi...|$|E
