5|$|Exponentiating a {{real number}} {{to a complex}} power is {{formally}} a different operation from that for the corresponding <b>complex</b> <b>number.</b> However, in the common case of a positive real number the principal value is the same.|$|E
5|$|Linear {{combinations}} combine multiplication and summation; {{they are}} sums {{in which each}} term has a multiplier, usually a real or <b>complex</b> <b>number.</b> Linear combinations are especially useful in contexts where straightforward addition would violate some normalization rule, such as mixing of strategies in game theory or superposition of states in quantum mechanics.|$|E
5|$|The {{powers of}} {{negative}} real numbers {{are not always}} defined and are discontinuous even where defined. In fact, they are only defined when the exponent is a rational number with the denominator being an odd integer. When dealing with complex numbers the <b>complex</b> <b>number</b> operation is normally used instead.|$|E

50|$|Quaternions can be {{represented}} as pairs of <b>complex</b> <b>numbers.</b> From this perspective, quaternions {{are the result of}} applying the Cayley-Dickson construction to the <b>complex</b> <b>numbers.</b> This is a generalization of the construction of the <b>complex</b> <b>numbers</b> as pairs of real numbers.|$|R
5|$|The set of nth {{roots of}} a <b>complex</b> <b>number</b> w is {{obtained}} by multiplying the principal value w1/n {{by each of}} the nth roots of unity. For example, the fourth roots of 16 are 2, −2, 2i, and −2i, because the principal value of the fourth root of 16 is 2 and the fourth roots of unity are 1, −1, i, and −i.|$|E
5|$|Any nonrational {{power of}} a <b>complex</b> <b>number</b> has an {{infinite}} number of possible values because of the multi-valued nature of the complex logarithm. The principal value is a single value chosen from these by a rule which, amongst its other properties, ensures powers of complex numbers with a positive real part and zero imaginary part give the same value as does the rule defined above for the corresponding real base.|$|E
5|$|The {{inner product}} between two state vectors is a <b>complex</b> <b>number</b> {{known as a}} {{probability}} amplitude. During an ideal measurement of a quantum mechanical system, {{the probability that a}} system collapses from a given initial state to a particular eigenstate is given by the square of the absolute value of the probability amplitudes between the initial and final states. The possible results of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator—which explains the choice of self-adjoint operators, for all the eigenvalues must be real. The probability distribution of an observable in a given state can be found by computing the spectral decomposition of the corresponding operator.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} {{generalization of}} the derivative concerns complex functions of complex variables, such as functions from (a domain in) the complex numbers C to C. The {{notion of the}} derivative of such a function is obtained by replacing real variables with complex variables in the definition. If C is identified with R2 by writing a <b>complex</b> <b>number</b> z as , then a differentiable function from C to C is certainly differentiable as a function from R2 to R2 (in the sense that its partial derivatives all exist), but the converse is not true in general: the complex derivative only exists if the real derivative is complex linear and this imposes relations between the partial derivatives called the Cauchy–Riemann equations – see holomorphic functions.|$|E
5|$|In the mathematically {{rigorous}} {{formulation of}} quantum mechanics, developed by John von Neumann, the possible states (more precisely, the pure states) of a quantum mechanical system {{are represented by}} unit vectors (called state vectors) residing in a complex separable Hilbert space, known as the state space, well defined up to a <b>complex</b> <b>number</b> of norm 1 (the phase factor). In other words, the possible states are points in the projectivization of a Hilbert space, usually called the complex projective space. The exact nature of this Hilbert space {{is dependent on the}} system; for example, the position and momentum states for a single non-relativistic spin zero particle is the space of all square-integrable functions, while the states for the spin of a single proton are unit elements of the two-dimensional complex Hilbert space of spinors. Each observable is represented by a self-adjoint linear operator acting on the state space. Each eigenstate of an observable corresponds to an eigenvector of the operator, and the associated eigenvalue corresponds to the value of the observable in that eigenstate.|$|E
5|$|On 11 September 1940, George Stibitz {{transmitted}} {{problems for}} his <b>Complex</b> <b>Number</b> Calculator in New York using a teletype, {{and received the}} computed results back at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. This configuration of a centralized computer (mainframe) with remote dumb terminals remained popular well into the 1970s. However, already in the 1960s, researchers started to investigate packet switching, a technology that sends a message in portions to its destination asynchronously without passing it through a centralized mainframe. A four-node network emerged on 5 December 1969, constituting {{the beginnings of the}} ARPANET, which by 1981 had grown to 213 nodes. ARPANET eventually merged with other networks to form the Internet. While Internet development was a focus of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) who published a series of Request for Comment documents, other networking advancement occurred in industrial laboratories, such as the local area network (LAN) developments of Ethernet (1983) and the token ring protocol (1984).|$|E
