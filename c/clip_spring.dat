50|$|Orthodontic {{separators}} (commonly {{known as}} spacers) are rubber bands or metal appliances used in orthodontics. Spacers are placed between the molars {{at the second}} orthodontic appointment, before molar bands are applied. Spacers are either circular rubber bands about a centimeter in diameter placed between top and bottom molars; there may be 1-12 spacers applied or small metal <b>spring</b> <b>clips</b> (<b>spring</b> separators) that push the molars apart. The spacers stay between the teeth for one to two weeks and move the teeth apart slowly until they are far apart enough so that orthodontists can fit a tooth brace or molar band in between them or fit an expander with rubber rings.|$|R
5000|$|The grip/trigger housing {{assembly}} {{is held in}} place with a rather fragile leaf <b>spring</b> <b>clip</b> instead of the captive pins used in other designs. The <b>spring</b> <b>clip</b> {{has been known to}} be prone to breakage since the first trials at Aberdeen Proving Ground. Duct tape and cable ties have been seen on M60s in the field, placed there by their crews in case the <b>spring</b> <b>clip</b> breaks. The sear in the trigger mechanism gained a reputation for wearing down, and a malfunction could cause the gun to [...] "run away". A second sear notch was eventually added to the operating rod to reduce the chance of this happening.|$|R

50|$|To {{prevent a}} joint from {{separating}} during a reaction process, {{various types of}} plastic or metal <b>clips</b> or <b>springs</b> {{can be used to}} secure the two sides together. They are available in a variety of materials for different temperature and chemical environments.|$|R
5000|$|A {{crocodile}} clip (also alligator <b>clip</b> or <b>spring</b> <b>clip)</b> is a <b>sprung</b> metal <b>clip</b> with long, serrated jaws {{which is used}} for creating a temporary electrical connection. This simple mechanical device gets {{its name from the}} resemblance of its jaws to that of an alligator's or crocodile's. It is used to connect an electrical cable to a battery or some other component. Functioning much like a spring-loaded clothespin, the clip's tapered, serrated jaws are forced together by a spring to grip an object. When manufactured for electronics testing and evaluation, one jaw of the clip is typically permanently crimped or soldered to a wire, or is bent to form the inner tubular contact of a ~4 mm female banana jack, enabling quick non-permanent connection between a circuit under test and laboratory equipment or to another electrical circuit. The clip is typically covered by a plastic shroud or [...] "boot" [...] to prevent accidental short-circuits.|$|R
2500|$|There {{were two}} visibly {{different}} styles of mechanical design for the elements. The original models had a metal <b>spring</b> <b>clip</b> with two wire wings that were squeezed together to release the element from the typewriter. [...] Later models had a plastic lever molded around a metal axle which pried apart the now-internal <b>spring</b> <b>clip.</b> This {{had a tendency to}} break where the lever joined the axle. The Selectric element was later redesigned to have an all-plastic lever.|$|R
25|$|As power {{dissipation}} of components increases and component package size decreases, thermal engineers must innovate to ensure components won't overheat. Devices that run cooler last longer. A heat sink design must fulfill both its thermal {{as well as}} its mechanical requirements. Concerning the latter, the component must remain in thermal contact with its heat sink with reasonable shock and vibration. The heat sink could be the copper foil of a circuit board, or a separate heat sink mounted onto the component or circuit board. Attachment methods include thermally conductive tape or epoxy, wire-form z <b>clips,</b> flat <b>spring</b> <b>clips,</b> standoff spacers, and push pins with ends that expand after installing.|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY A {{synopsis}} {{of the types}} of vascular clips (malleable clips, screw <b>clips,</b> and <b>spring</b> <b>clips)</b> used by neurosurgeons during this century is presented. A review of the pertinent literature is in-cluded. THE INCREASING IMPORTANCE of small vascular clips in the surgical treatment of stroke is apparent from the large numbers of such clips used by neurosurgeons in this century. 1 " There are more than 40 types used for vascular occlusion, obliteration of aneurysms and arteriovenous mal-formations, and temporary occlusion of vessels during sur-gery of vascular anomalies or microvascular anastomoses. More recently there has been a particular interest in types of microvascular clips which are too weak to effectively clip an aneurysm but satisfactory for nontraumatic, temporary occlusion of 1 -mm vessels...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{the rail}} {{fastening}} systems {{play an important}} role for preserving the connection between the rails and sleepers in various conditions. In this paper, stress based concept is used to develop a comprehensive approach for fatigue reliability analysisof fastening <b>spring</b> <b>clip.</b> Axle load, speed and material properties are assumed to be random variables. First, track and train models are analyzed dynamically in order to achieve displacement time history of fas-tening <b>spring</b> <b>clip.</b> Then this displacement time history is applied to the fastening <b>spring</b> <b>clip</b> in FE software to obtain variable ampli-tude of stresses. Crack nucleation life is calculated by rain-flow method and Palmgren-Miner linear damage rule. First Order Relia-bility Method (FORM) and Monte-Carlosimulation technique are employed for the reliability index estimations. The influences of various random variables on the probability of failure are investi-gated by sensitivity analysis. The results show that the equivalent stress range and material parameter have significant effect on fa-tigue crack nucleation...|$|R

50|$|Although the inquest {{recorded}} a verdict of misadventure, the jury were informed of several failures {{on the part}} of the BBC. Graham Games of the Health and Safety Executive stated that the clip could have been opened by the weight of a bag of sugar, and demonstrated that the <b>clip</b> <b>sprang</b> loose 14 times in 20. David Kirke, a bungee specialist from the Dangerous Sports Club, stated that a similar stunt he had been involved with used three ropes, as opposed to the one rope used by the BBC, and shackles in the place of carabiner clips. The safety officer, Andrew Smith, was not on hand, and no supervision or demonstration from a trained stuntman had occurred. There was also no way for Lush to contact the ground once he was in the air, and nobody in the air with him in case he changed his mind; the jury heard that he delayed for almost two minutes before finally being instructed to make the jump. Furthermore, despite advice against it, the BBC production team had insisted on the use of an elasticated bungee rope.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of agronomic practices on forage production and chemical composition of grass-legume pasture mixture was {{studied at the}} Utah State University Dairy Farm, North Logan, Utah, during spring and summer, 1970. The soil is a well-drained Millville silt loam that has about a 1 percent slope. It is high in potash, phosphorus, and lime, having a pH of 7. 9. Analysis of the clipping management showed that the early <b>spring</b> <b>clipping</b> decreased the yield of forage. The losses in total yield due to <b>spring</b> <b>clipping</b> were approximately {{four to five times}} the yields received in early <b>spring</b> <b>clipping.</b> The grasses were affected more than the legumes. The yields of dry forage increased with the increase in fertilizer rates from 0 through 300 pounds of nitrogen per acre. There was no advantage to splitting the nitrogen fertilizer of 300 pounds per acre into three applications. Most of the effects of spring clipp 1 ng and nitrogen fertilization were re fleeted in the first summer harvest. The plots fertilized with nitrogen produced a higher yield and nitrate content than the check plots. Legumes were higher in nitrate on the unfertilized plots than the grasses, but lower on the fertilized plots...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} study the influence of cutting treatments on the yield and quality of non-irrigated alfalfa in western Oregon. <b>Spring</b> <b>clipping</b> treatments included (1) not clipped, (2) clipped when 6 inches high and (3) clipped when 12 inches high. The hay harvest criteria were (1) near full light interception by the vegetative canopy, (2) crown bud stage and (3) one-tenth bloom stage. Combinations of these criteria included first hay harvest based on light interception followed by either of the other criteria at subsequent harvests, and first harvest based on crown bud development in combination with one-tenth bloom criterion for subsequent harvest. Two alfalfa varieties, Vernal and Du Puits, were subjected {{to each of the}} 18 treatments (6 x 3 in all combinations). Results of one growing season indicated that the influence of <b>spring</b> <b>clipping</b> was not reflected in yield of dry matter (hay) except at the relatively small third harvest when <b>spring</b> <b>clipping</b> showed a deleterious effect. The yields obtained by the <b>spring</b> <b>clipping</b> were sufficient to offset the reduction at the third hay harvest. It was observed that the total yields for the season did not differ. Cutting at the one-tenth bloom stage showed an advantage in yield but with a greatly reduced crude protein percentage. Cutting on the basis of nearly complete light interception resulted in harvest at an immature stage in early May and at a very mature stage in late season. Highest yields, with leafiness and crude protein suitable for high quality hay, were obtained by cutting at the crown bud stage throughout the season, or by taking the first harvest on the basis of light interception and subsequent harvests on the basis of either crown buds or one-tenth bloom. The varieties produced approximately the same total for the season. Vernal was slightly leafier than Du Puits at the second and third hay harvests. A highly significant negative correlation was found between yield of dry matter and percentage protein and between yield of dry matter and leaf-stem ratio. The correlation between percentage protein and leaf-stem ratio was significant and positive...|$|R
