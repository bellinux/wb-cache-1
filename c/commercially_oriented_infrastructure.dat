The analyses of variance on the unsegmented data elements determined no difference between corporation groups, however analyses of segmented data elements resulted in significant variations. Segmented data appears to be necessary to explain the variations due to either type of corporation or time period. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|In Australia, as in {{many parts}} of the western world, {{financial}} reporting in all levels of government has seen the rise of <b>commercially</b> <b>oriented</b> accounting requirements which are assumed to capture and report on accountability and performance. However, there is a growing belief that financial accountability does not represent the full spectrum of accountability relationships. Moreover, <b>commercially</b> <b>oriented</b> accounting systems have some serious shortcomings when used in government circles. New public management, whilst including a focus on performance, emphasises outputs and resource efficiency, not outcomes and community needs. In local government in particular, there is a need to focus on internal financial management, as opposed to financial reporting. It has been suggested that the focus on financial accounting systems in the npm does not result in enhanced performance and may even be injurious. Research undertaken in australian local government points to serious shortcomings in internal financial control systems, even while commercial accounting practices have been imposed on the sector. Budgets alone have come in for some stinging criticism in the state which has been at the forefront of reform and restructure. The situation in other states is likely to be much worse. Other research has identified a lack of strategic orientation in financial management and control systems (fmcs) in local government. Those who suggest <b>commercially</b> <b>oriented</b> accounting systems as a panacea for accountability have also ignored the impact of organisational culture in developing fmcs. This research suggests a conceptual model for fmcs in local government which takes a strategic focus and impounds the effects of organisational culture...|$|R
