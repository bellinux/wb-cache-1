5|$|Apple's {{litigation}} over {{object code}} {{contributed to the}} development of contemporary copyright law because the company's object code cases brought different results in different courts, creating a conflict of laws that resulted in international litigation. In the 1980s, Apple litigated two copyright cases with central issues that included the question of whether object code (as contrasted with source code) of a <b>computer</b> program is subject to copyright laws. A third case in which Apple was not a party but that involved the Apple decisions followed in New Zealand. The specific cases were <b>Computer</b> Edge Pty. Ltd. v Apple <b>Computer</b> Inc. (1986, Australia) ("Computer Edge"), Apple <b>Computer</b> Inc. v Mackintosh Computers Ltd., (Canada, 1987) ("Apple v. Mackintosh"), and IBM v. <b>Computer</b> Imports Ltd.

5|$|In 1971, DEC {{employee}} David H.

In 1973, he released the book 101 BASIC <b>Computer</b> Games, containing descriptions and the source code for video games written in BASIC. The games included were written by both Ahl and others, and included both games original to the language and ported from other languages such as FOCAL. Many of these ports were originally mainframe <b>computer</b> games. 101 BASIC <b>Computer</b> Games was a landmark title in <b>computer</b> games programming, and was a best-selling title with more than 10,000 copies soldâ€”more sales than computers in existence at the time. Its second edition in 1978, titled BASIC <b>Computer</b> Games, was the first million-selling <b>computer</b> book. As such, the BASIC ports of mainframe <b>computer</b> games included in the book were often more long-lived than their original versions or other mainframe <b>computer</b> games.|$|E
