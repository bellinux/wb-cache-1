40|$|This paper {{presents}} a performance analysis for star trackers that adopt Active Pixel Sensor photodetector technology. They have many advantages on <b>Charge</b> <b>Coupled</b> <b>Devices</b> such as low power consumption, single voltage supply needed (3. 3 V or 5 V), increased radiation hardness, simplified qualification procedures, capability of local reset and readout, onchip integrated timing, control, and analog-to-digital conversion. Unfortunately, their noise level {{is higher than}} in <b>Charge</b> <b>Coupled</b> <b>Devices.</b> Anyway, this effect can be compensated {{by taking advantage of}} their capability to manage different local exposure times. This allows for tracking bright stars at a faster tracking frequency than the one that is selected for <b>Charge</b> <b>Coupled</b> <b>Devices,</b> whereas a slower frequency is set for dim stars. The resulting temporal average of the number of observed stars is closer than the one of single shutter systems to the number of stars observed by <b>Charge</b> <b>Coupled</b> <b>Devices.</b> As a consequence, also the accuracy in attitude determination increases because it {{is a function of the}} number of detected stars. An analytical investigation of the attainable accuracy is discussed. All sensor noise sources are considered and their effects are evaluated as a function of the exposure time. The resulting accuracy turns out to be in the range 1 - 3 arcsec that is the one requested for low cost star sensors...|$|R

2500|$|A {{charge-coupled}} device (CCD) is a device {{for the movement}} of electrical charge, usually from within the device to {{an area where the}} charge can be manipulated. This is achieved by [...] "shifting" [...] the signals between stages within the device one at a time. CCDs move charge between capacitive bins in the device, with the shift allowing for the transfer of charge between bins. Often the device is integrated with an image sensor, such as a photoelectric device to produce the charge that is being read, thus making the CCD a major technology for digital imaging. First conceived in its usefulness for computer memory, the <b>charge</b> <b>coupled</b> <b>device</b> was co-invented in 1969 by American physicist George E.

40|$|Abstract—Electron {{multiplying}} <b>charge</b> <b>coupled</b> <b>devices</b> (EMCCDs) have {{revolutionized the}} world of low light imaging by introducing on-chip multiplication gain based on the impact ionization effect in the silicon. They combine the sub-electron readout noise with high frame rates. Signal-to-noise Ratio (SNR) is an important performance parameter for low-light-level imaging systems. This work investigates the SNR performance of an EMCCD operated in Non-inverted Mode (NIMO) and Inverted Mode (IMO). The theory of noise characteristics and operation modes is presented. The {{results show that the}} SNR of is determined by dark current and clock induced charge at high gain level. The optimum SNR performance is provided by an EMCCD operated in NIMO in short exposure and strong cooling applications. In contrast, an IMO EMCCD is preferable.
