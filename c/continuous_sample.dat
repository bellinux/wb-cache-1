40|$|In this paper, a {{modification}} is proposed on the tightened two-level <b>continuous</b> <b>sampling</b> plan. The tightened two-level plan {{is one of}} the three tightened multi-level <b>continuous</b> <b>sampling</b> plans of Derman et al. (1957) with two sampling levels. A modified tightened two-level <b>continuous</b> <b>sampling</b> plan is considered, for which the rules concerning partial inspection depend, in part, on the length of time it takes to decide that the process quality is good enough that 100 % inspection may be suspended (e. g. the time required to find i consecutive items free of defects). Using a Markov chain model, expressions for the performance measures of the modified MLP-T- 2 plan are derived. The modified MLP-T- 2 plan is shown to be identical to the MLP-T- 2 plan.

50|$|The {{flow cell}} format is most {{commonly}} implemented in hematology instruments, and sometimes flow cytometers.

Further, the use of a flow cell lends itself to addition of a sheath flow, which keeps particles centered {{in the middle of the}} flow channel. This allows measurements to be performed simultaneously, such as probing the object with a laser. The major disadvantages of the flow cell format are that it is much more expensive to manufacture and is typically fixed to one channel width, whereas the aperture format offers a wide variety of aperture sizes.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the leading}} groups in academy for {{creating}} ion-trap MMS is Prof. Graham Cooks with his associate Professor Zheng Ouyang at Purdue University. They have built a series of mini mass spectrometer based on quadrupole ion trap called Mini 10, Mini 11, Mini 12. The group used Mini 10 mass spectrometer weighing 10 kg to analyze proteins, peptides and alkaloids in complex plant materials with electrospray ionization ESI. The group used low radio frequency of resonant ion ejection to increase mass range up to 17,000 Da proteins. For interfacing ESI source with MMS, a 10 cm stainless steel capillary was fabricated to transfer the ions directly into the vacuum manifold. The resulting high pressure of 20 mTorr, which is several orders of magnitude higher than that used in lab-scale mass spectrometers is compensated by using the pressure-tolerant rectilinear ion trap (RIT). One of the key component of this MMS is the commercial turbo-bump and the MS can be operated at 10−3 torr. To overcome the problem of <b>continuous</b> <b>sample</b> introduction {{because of the small}} size of the pump, the group developed a technique called discontinuous atmospheric pressure introduction (DAPI). This technique performs direct chemical analysis without sample pretreatment and enables the coupling of miniature mass spectrometers to atmospheric pressure ionization sources, including ESI, atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), and various ambient ionization sources. The ions are transferred from ionization source and hold at a punch-valve and injected to MS periodically. The performance of a hand-held Mini-10 mass spectrometer was upgraded with negative ion mode for detecting explosive compounds and hazardous mateirals at picogram level which is highly applicable for airport luggage checking.|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of antibiotics {{in the environment}} and their subsequent impact on resistance development has raised concerns globally. Hospitals are {{a major source of}} antibiotics released into the environment. To reduce these residues, research to improve knowledge of the dynamics of antibiotic release from hospitals is essential. Therefore, we undertook a study to estimate seasonal and temporal variation in antibiotic release from two hospitals in India over a period of two years. For this, 6 sampling sessions of 24 hours each were conducted in the three prominent seasons of India, at all wastewater outlets of the two hospitals, using <b>continuous</b> and grab <b>sampling</b> methods. An in-house wastewater sampler was designed for <b>continuous</b> <b>sampling.</b> Eight antibiotics from four major antibiotic groups were selected for the study. To understand the temporal pattern of antibiotic release, each of the 24 -hour sessions were divided in three sub-sampling sessions of 8 hours each. Solid phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to determine the antibiotic residues. Six of the eight antibiotics studied were detected in the wastewater <b>samples.</b> Both <b>continuous</b> and grab <b>sampling</b> methods indicated that the highest quantities of fluoroquinolones were released in winter followed by the rainy season and the summer. No temporal pattern in antibiotic release was detected.
