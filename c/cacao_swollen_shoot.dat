The partially effective methods of management mentioned above were not realized until the late 1960s and 1970s.

40|$|Background: <b>Cacao</b> <b>swollen</b> <b>shoot</b> virus (CSSV), <b>Cacao</b> <b>swollen</b> <b>shoot</b> CD virus (CSSCDV), and <b>Cacao</b> <b>swollen</b> <b>shoot</b> Togo A virus (CSSTAV) cause <b>cacao</b> <b>swollen</b> <b>shoot</b> disease (CSSD) in West Africa. During 2000 - 2003, {{leaf and}} shoot-swelling {{symptoms}} and rapid tree death {{were observed in}} cacao in Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana. Molecular tests showed positive infection in only similar to 50 - 60 % of symptomatic trees, suggesting the possible emergence of an unknown badnavirus. Methods: The DNA virome was determined from symptomatic cacao samples using Illumina-Hi Seq, and sequence accuracy was verified by Sanger sequencing. The resultant 14, and seven previously known, full-length badnaviral genomic and RT-RNase H sequences were analyzed by pairwise distance analysis to resolve species relationships, and by Maximum likelihood (ML) to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships. The viral coding and non-coding sequences, genome organization, and predicted conserved protein domains (CPDs) were identified and characterized at the species level. Results: The 21 CSSD-badnaviral genomes and RT-RNase H sequences shared 70 - 100 % and 72 - 100 % identity, respectively. The RT-RNase H analysis predicted four species, based on an >= 80 % species cutoff. The ML genome sequence tree resolved three well-supported clades, with >= 70 % bootstrap, whereas, the RT-RNase H phylogeny was poorly resolved, however, both trees grouped CSSD isolates within one large clade, including the newly discovered Cacao red vein virus (CRVV) proposed species. The genome arrangement of the four species consists of four, five, or six predicted open reading frames (ORFs), and the CPDs have similar architectures. By comparison, two New World cacao-infecting badnaviruses encode four ORFs, and harbor CPDs like the West African species. Conclusions: Three previously recognized West African cacao-infecting badnaviral species were identified, and a fourth, previously unidentified species, CRVV, is described for the first time. The CRVV is a suspect causal agent of the rapid decline phenotype, however Koch's Postulates have not been proven. To reconcile viral evolutionary with epidemiology considerations, more detailed information about CSSD-genomic variability is essential. Also, the functional basis for the multiple genome arrangements and subtly distinct CPD architectures among cacao-infecting badnaviruses is poorly understood. New knowledge about functional relationships may help explain the diverse symptomatologies observed in affected cacao trees...|$|E

The CSSV groups in Ghana are very divergent and correspond to at least five different putative species, according to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses recommendations (A, B-C complex, G, E, and M), with the M species only being detected in the alternate host Ceiba pentandra.

CSSV populations in West African countries are highly variable and genetically structured into several different groups based on the diversity in the first part of ORF 3 which encodes the movement protein. To unravel the extent of isolate diversity and address the problems of low titer and mixed viral sequences in samples, we used Illumina MiSeq and HiSeq technology. We were able to reconstruct de novo 20 new complete genomes from cacao samples collected in the Cocoa Research Institute of Ghana (CRIG) Museum and from the field samples collected in Côte d’Ivoire or Ghana. Based on the 20 % threshold of nucleotide divergence in the reverse transcriptase/ribonuclease H (RT/RNase H) region which denotes species demarcation, we conclude to the existence of seven new species associated with the <b>cacao</b> <b>swollen</b> <b>shoot</b> disease.

This study characterised {{the current status}} of the disease in the major cacao growing States in Nigeria and attempted a clarification on the manner of CSSV transmission. Two separate field surveys and sample collections were conducted in Nigeria in summer 2012 and spring 2013. PCR-based screening of cacao leaf samples and subsequent DNA sequencing showed that the disease continues to persist in Ondo and Oyo States and in new cacao sites in Abia, Akwa Ibom, Cross River and Edo States. Mealybug samples collected were identified using a robust approach involving environmental scanning electron microscopy, histology and DNA barcoding, which highlighted the importance of integrative taxonomy in the study. The results show that the genus Planococcus (Planococcus citri (Risso) and/or Planococcus minor (Maskell)) was the most abundant vector (73. 5 %) at the sites examined followed by Formicococcus njalensis (Laing) (19. 0 %). In a laboratory study, the feeding behaviour of Pl. citri, Pseudococcus longispinus (Targioni-Tozzetti) and Pseudococcus viburni (Signoret) on cacao were investigated using electrical penetration graph (EPG) analysis. EPG waveforms reflecting intercellular stylet penetration (C), extracellular salivation (E 1 e), salivation in sieve elements (E 1), phloem ingestion (E 2), derailed stylet mechanics (F), xylem ingestion (G) and non-probing phase (Np) were analysed. Individual mealybugs exhibited marked variation within species and significantly differed (p ≤. 05) between species for E 1 e and E 1. PCR-based assessments of the retention time for CSSV in viruliferous Pl. citri, Ps. longispinus and Ps. viburni fed on a non-cacao diet showed that CSSV was still detectable after 144 hours.

40|$|<b>Cacao</b> <b>swollen</b> <b>shoot</b> virus (CSSV) is {{the only}} virus disease of cacao that is {{prevalent}} and damaging. CSSV is a dsDNA virus of the genus Badnavirus and the family Caulimoviridae transmitted by several species of mealybugs. The historical emergence of the disease is {{closely associated with the}} establishment of cacao cultivation in West Africa as it appeared soon after the introduction of the cacao in West Africa and remains endemic to this area. The disease is likely due to several host shifts from indigenous hosts. We can additionally conclude from the high molecular variability of the virus that the disease consists of a complex of viral species. Although the disease spreads slowly, eradication campaigns have failed to contain the disease which continues to emerge in new West African regions. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

30|$|It is {{well known}} that many serious {{diseases}} of crop plants are caused by viruses. For severe cases, plant diseases have caused large-scale damage to various crops, which resulted in a diminished output in whole regions; for instance, cocoa <b>swollen</b> <b>shoot</b> in Ghana [1, 2] and banana bunchy top in Australia [3 – 5]. When a crop is widely planted in a new area, plant disease prevention usually becomes important. In most cases, we rogue (remove) infected plants as a control strategy when disease breaks out. Since 1946, 190 million infected trees have been removed in Ghana [6]. In addition, we can also rogue not only visibly infected plants but also other neighboring plants which do not yet show symptoms [2, 7], but this measure may be unpopular with farmers since it involves removal of apparently healthy plants which may still be highly productive [8].|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Mealybugs (Hemiptera: Coccoidea: Pseudococcidae) are key vectors of badnaviruses, {{including}} <b>Cacao</b> <b>Swollen</b> <b>Shoot</b> Virus (CSSV) {{the most}} damaging virus affecting cacao (Theobroma cacao L.). The effectiveness of mealybugs as virus vectors is species dependent and it is therefore vital that CSSV resistance breeding programmes in cacao incorporate accurate mealybug identification. In this work the efficacy of a CO 1 -based DNA barcoding approach to species identification was evaluated by screening a range of mealybugs collected from cacao in seven countries. RESULTS: Morphologically similar adult females were characterised by scanning electron microscopy and then, following DNA extraction, were screened with CO 1 barcoding markers. A high degree of CO 1 sequence homology was observed for all 11 individual haplotypes including those accessions from distinct geographical regions. This has allowed {{for the design of}} a High Resolution Melt (HRM) assay capable of rapid identification of the commonly encountered mealybug pests of cacao.

ORF III is closely linked to ORF II and overlaps ORF IV out of frame in the CaMV genome. A new CaMV-derived vector (CaΔ) devoid of ORF III and containing unique restriction sites between ORFs II and IV was designed. Introduction of the wild-type CaMV ORF III into CaΔ results in a clone (Ca 3) infectious in turnip plants. Truncated or point-mutated versions of ORF III were then inserted into CaΔ and testedin vivo. Inoculation of the different mutants into turnip revealed that the four C-terminal amino acid residues of PIII are dispensable for infectivity {{as well as an}} internal domain (amino acids 61 to 80). Taken together the results show that PIII possesses a functional two-domain organization. Moreover, the CaMV PIII function(s) cannot be replaced either by the PIII protein of another caulimovirus, the figwort mosaic virus, or by the P 2 protein of the <b>cacao</b> <b>swollen</b> <b>shoot</b> badnavirus, a member of the second plant pararetrovirus group...|$|E

Since there are alternative host species that could also serve as inoculum, their removal has been advised too.

We have genetically transformed three non-host species with an infectious form of the CSSV genome: two experimental hosts widely used in plant virology (Nicotiana tabacum and N. benthamiana) and the model species Arabidopsis thaliana. In transformed plants of all three species, the CSSV genome was able to replicate, and in tobacco, CSSV particles could be observed by immunosorbent electron microscopy, demonstrating that the complete virus cycle could be completed in a non-host plant.

40|$|<b>Cacao</b> <b>swollen</b> <b>shoot</b> virus (CSSV) {{is a major}} {{pathogen}} {{that has}} seriously constrained cocoa production in West Africa, particularly Ghana and Nigeria. To date, cordon sanitaire control measures in Ghana have failed {{to prevent the spread}} of the condition caused by the virus, <b>Cacao</b> <b>swollen</b> <b>shoot</b> virus disease (CSSVD). The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of cocoa somatic embryogenesis to produce virus-free clonal propagation material both for replanting and to facilitate the safe international exchange of germplasm. CSSVD detection in the field is hampered by the sometimes slow appearance of visual symptoms and their complete absence in mild strains. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) -based screening, a sensitive tool for microbial pathogen identification, is employed in this study because of its capacity for CSSV detection prior to the appearance of visual symptoms. Degenerate PCR primers were developed in order to improve the CSSV-strain dependence of earlier tests. Accordingly it was found that these primers (comprising a mixture of 48 variable redundant nucleotide bases) were capable of detecting 37 out of a putative 56 CSSV strains maintained at the Cocoa Research Institute of Ghana, four more than the sequence specific primers. For tissue culture studies, cocoa staminodes cultures were established from flowers of CSSV-infected cocoa genotypes CL 19 / 10 strain 1 A and Amelonado Plant 2 to produce callus, primary and secondary somatic embryos, with genotype AMAZ 15 from the Intermediate Cocoa Quarantine Facility used as a virus-free control. In terms of primary somatic embryo production tested across five cocoa genotypes the Nestle protocol proved to be more efficient than the Penn State protocol, although the distinction was less clear with virus-infected donor trees. PCR- based CSSV detection proved that virus could be detected at callus, primary somatic embryos and secondary somatic embryo stages, although the frequency of CSSV was reduced, indicating that the progress of the virus was progressively impeded. Assessment on the presence of plasmodesmata within CSSV-infected cocoa tissues by using transmission electron microscopy was hampered with the presence of artefacts in all sections mounted on Formvar films. Plasmodesmata were not detected may be indicative of a low frequency of plasmodesmata and may also be due to the techniques and methods used. Trials were conducted to assess Nicotiana benthamiana plantlets as alternate CSSV indicators and while they did receive viral DNA this was at too Iowa frequency to make them a viable option for glasshouse- based viral screening. The overall findings of this work do, however, support the use of somatic embryogenesis as a means of improving CSSV-free clonal propagation of cocoa.

30|$|According to Dormon et al. (2004), the {{incidence}} of insect pests and diseases is a major challenge in cocoa production in Ghana and has resulted in low yields due to inadequate management. Duguma et al. (1998), Lass (2004) and Dormon et al. (2007) estimate losses by insect pests and diseases to be 30  % of global yields of cocoa annually, whereas site-specific losses ranging from 10 to 80  % annually have been reported. In Ghana, the mirids (capsids) and the black pod disease are the most destructive {{of the number of}} insect pests and diseases which attack the developing cocoa tree and the development or ripening of cocoa pod. Farmers in the study area identified mirids as the major insect pest. Other insect pests of cocoa mentioned included termites, mealy bugs, ants, mites, shield bugs, stem borers, and pod borers. This confirms the fact that marids remain the insect pest of economic importance in Ghana (Antwi-Agyakwa 2013). The major cocoa disease mentioned by farmers was the black pod followed by the cocoa <b>swollen</b> <b>shoot</b> virus. Mistletoe a parasitic plant and rodents were also mentioned by some farmers to cause decline in cocoa production in the study area. According to the farmers, capsid and black pod attacks were the major causes of pre-harvest losses in their cocoa farms (65 and 45  % of the respondents respectively). On the other hand, 17  % of the respondents reported that rodents were among the pests of cocoa causing pre-harvest losses and this could be attributed to poor maintenance of farms. However, some farmers could not differentiate between damages caused by these insect pest and diseases and as such misinterpreted the damage of one insect pest or disease for the other.|$|R

Its importance is {{not only in the}} contribution of about 25 % annually of the total foreign exchange earnings but also on account of being the source of livelihoods for many rural farmers and the related actors in the value chain. The critical actors in the innovation system are the farmers, the researchers, the buyers, the transporters, public officers, consumers and the policy makers. By the roles and functions they perform, they impact on the dynamics of the cocoa industry. The paper describes the trends in cocoa production and processing and highlights the key characteristics and implications. It discusses the policy reforms in the cocoa industry and the major drivers of the reforms. The Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) {{is one of the biggest}} public institutions in Ghana and its subsidiaries are major actors in the production process of cocoa for export. The key reforms in the policies governing the industry were the dissolution of the monopoly of Produce Buying Company and the deregulation of cocoa purchasing to allow Licensed Buying Companies (LBCs) to enter the business in 1992 / 93 crop season.

40|$|Cocoa <b>Swollen</b> <b>Shoot</b> Virus Disease (CSSVD) {{is one of}} {{the major}} factors {{limiting}} cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) productivity in West Africa. The only cure for CSSVD is to cut out visibly infected trees and the official eradication campaign in Ghana has cut out more than 200 million trees since 1946. 80 years of research on preventive control measures have mainly focused on resistance breeding, mild strain cross-protection (inoculation of cocoa seedlings with a mild strain of the virus to protect against the severe strain) and control of mealybug vectors. Meanwhile, diversification measures such as agroforestry (for shading) or barrier (strip) cropping have received less attention. Despite promising results, CSSVD is more prevalent in the field than ever before. The large body of knowledge on preventive control measures for CSSVD is fragmented and many publications are not easily accessible. Furthermore, the literature has never been systematically evaluated and quantitatively assessed. Hence, we consolidated this knowledge with an extensive literature review followed by meta-analysis to identify the pertinent research gaps. Out of 423 publications on CSSVD-related issues, we selected 34 studies, which contained 52 datasets on seven different preventive control measures. Results showed that resistance breeding and mild strain crossprotection may reduce CSSVD infection by 30 percent, while the potential of diversification measures (shading/agroforestry and barrier (strip) cropping) seems to be considerably higher (40 and 85 percent, respectively). However, there is a lack of evidence because of a low number of studies about diversification measures, indicating that our results have to be interpreted with care and calling for more research in this area. Future testing is needed to evaluate the efficacy of barrier (strip) cropping to reduce CSSVD, and address the effect of shade on CSSVD symptom severity. Furthermore, the practical relevance of different preventive control measures for farmers needs to be assessed, and shade should be considered in current breeding programs for CSSVD resistance...|$|R
40|$|The need to {{conserve}} biodiversity of cocoa has become paramount {{due to the}} action {{of a range of}} diseases, pests and environmental hazards. In 1983 bushfire destroyed 60, 000 ha of cocoa plantation in Ghana and as of 1982 185. 5 million trees have been cut down in Eastern region of Ghana alone due to <b>Cacao</b> <b>Swollen</b> <b>Shoot</b> Virus (CSSV) infection. In order to safeguard germplasm of cocoa there is the need to use in vitro-based techniques to support in situ conservation. Successful cryopreservation of cocoa has already been demonstrated using an encapsulation-dehydration method but this is a labour intensive protocol requiring a relatively high level of technical skill and the objective of the current work is to explore the efficacy of a vitrification-based approach. Floral-derived secondary somatic embryos (SSE) of cocoa genotype AMAZ 15 were utilised. In order to optimise the vitrification procedure the effect of preculturing SSEs on sucrose and dehydration with plant vitrification solution 2 (PVS 2) was studied. SSEs were precultured on embryo development (ED) medium supplemented with either 0. 5 or 0. 75 M sucrose for 3 or 5 d and dehydrated with cold PVS 2 for 45 - 105 rin before storage in liquid nitrogen (LN). Preculturing the embryos on 0. 5 M sucrose for 5 d and dehydrating them in PVS 2 for 60 min led to significantly higher post-cryo survival than any other treatment (74. 5 ± 6. 4 %). So as to minimise cryo-injury due to cation- induced free radical formation, nutrient cation sources were removed from the ED solution and/or the recovery medium (ED), the former treatment resulting in a significant benefit. The influence of size of cotyledonary stage SSEs on postcryo' survival was studied for two size ranges. SSEs between 2 - 3 mm survived better than those between 4 - 5 mm. The protocol was effective across five other genotypes so far tested without further procedural variation. In order to accelerate bulking up of clones, embryos regenerated following cryopreservation were used as explant sources and the freezing process was not found to have any inhibitory effect on their embryogenic potential. In order to optimise the dehydration process Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was used to examine SSEs during cooling and warming. Partial vitrification, as evidenced by glass transition and ice melting, was achieved when embryos were exposed to PVS 2 for 45 and 60 min which correlated with higher post- cryo survival. Application of somatic embryogenesis and cryopreservation to eradicate <b>Cacao</b> <b>Swollen</b> <b>Shoot</b> Virus (CSSV) was also studied. While somatic embryogenesis was able to reduce CSSV transmission in genotypes studied the assessment of any 'cryotherapy' effect was limited by the availability of post-cryo regenerants.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of new outbreaks caused by <b>Cacao</b> <b>swollen</b> <b>shoot</b> virus (CSSV) in Côte d'Ivoire in 2003, when this disease {{seemed to have}} been eradicated {{since the end of the}} 1950 s in that country, casts doubt on the sustainability of Ivorian cocoa production. The aims of this study were, first, to carry out a molecular characterization of CSSV isolates from the main outbreaks in Côte d'Ivoire; second, determine their phylogenetic position in relation to isolates already discovered in Togo and Ghana; and, finally, study their geographical distribution to understand the dispersal of the virus. Additionally, this study was intended to enable the implementation and validation of a polyvalent molecular diagnosis assay for CSSV. Sequences analyses, corresponding to a fragment located at the 5 ? end of open reading frame (ORF) 3 of the CSSV genome, revealed three new CSSV groups (D, E, and F) distinct from the A, B, and C groups already identified in Togo. Only group B was detected in all the outbreaks, whereas groups A and C were not identified in Côte d'Ivoire. In addition, a polymerase chain reaction diagnostic using the ORF 3 A F/R primer pair was polyvalent, because it enabled the detection of CSSV in 90 % of the plots in all the cocoa regions analyzed by this study.

40|$|DNA- and RNA-based {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} (PCR) systems were used with <b>Cacao</b> <b>swollen</b> <b>shoot</b> virus (CSSV) primers designed from conserved regions of the six published genomic sequences of CSSV to investigate whether the virus is transmissible from infected trees through cross-pollination to seeds and seedlings. Pollen was harvested from CSSV infected cocoa trees and used to cross-pollinate flowers of healthy cocoa trees (recipient parents) to generate enough cocoa seeds for the PCR screening. Adequate precautions were taken to avoid cross-contamination during duplicated DNA extractions and only PCR results accompanied by effective positive and negative controls were scored. Results from the PCR analyses showed that samples of cocoa pod husk, mesocarp and seed tissues (testa, cotyledon and embryo) from the cross-pollinations were PCR negative for CSSV DNA. Sequential DNA samples from new leaves of seedlings resulting from the cross-pollinated trees were consistently PCR negative for presence of portions of CSSV DNA for over 36 months after germination. A reverse transcription-PCR analysis performed on the seedlings showed negative results, indicating absence of functional CSSV RNA transcripts in the seedlings. None of the seedlings exhibited symptoms characteristic of the CSSV disease, and all infectivity tests on the seedlings were also negative. Following these results, the study concluded that although CSSV DNA was detected in pollen from CSSV infected trees, {{there was no evidence}} of pollen transmission of the virus through cross-pollination from infected cocoa parents to healthy cocoa trees.

40|$|AbstractA {{diagnostic}} {{study was conducted}} to identify the major constraints on organic cocoa production at Brong-Densuso and surrounding communities in the Suhum-Kraboa-Coaltar District, Eastern Region, Ghana. The study followed a technographic study that highlighted cocoa as a public crop requiring broad techno-social innovations. In the technographic study, problems identified included low yields, persistent pest management constraints and a low adoption rate of technologies developed by the Cocoa Research Institute of Ghana. The {{diagnostic study}} adopted a Participatory Learning and Action Research approach to set up and implement fieldwork with relevant stakeholders leading to problem identification, prioritization, and collective design of an action plan (research agenda). Cocoa farmers within the study area are conscious of the environmental problems {{associated with the use of}} inorganic pesticides and the high cost of using them. Hence, they produce cocoa without applying any pesticides. Quite recently, however, their association with an organic marketing company led to a search for non-chemical pest and disease control measures and for ways to certify their cocoa beans as organic. A misconception as to what species of cocoa pests constitute ‘capsids’ was settled between farmers and scientists using a cage experiment on capsid damage. The farmers became convinced that the Cocoa Mosquito (Helopeltis spp.) (Hemiptera: Miridae), which they had previously considered an important pest, was a capsid species that caused little or no damage to the beans inside the pods. After this clarification, damage caused by the Brown Capsid (Sahlbergella singularis; Hemiptera: Miridae) and the Black Capsid (Distantiella theobroma; Hemiptera: Miridae) emerged as the most serious production constraint, followed by Black Pod disease (caused by Phytophtora palmivora). The malfunctioning of tenure agreements and the mistrust between landlords, who are mainly absentee farmers, and their caretaker cocoa farmers pose a serious threat to pest management innovations, especially where pruning to control Black Pod disease and uprooting trees infected with <b>Swollen</b> <b>Shoot</b> disease are concerned. The key stakeholders involved in the study agreed on three innovative (organic) capsid control methods for further research: the use of sex pheromone traps, crude aqueous neem (Azadirachta indica) seed extracts, and the use of ant (Oecophylla longinoda) colonies as biological control agents, the latter being proposed by farmers. The paper reflects on the diagnostic study as a continuous process in response to a continually changing context even beyond the end of the diagnostic research phase...|$|R
40|$|Cocoa <b>swollen</b> <b>shoot</b> {{virus disease}} (CSSVD) seriously affects cocoa {{production}} in Ghana, {{particularly in the}} areas of mass infection (AMI) in the Eastern Region whilst the disease continues spreading to areas with scatter outbreaks especially in the Western Region. Reports utilising visible diagnostic symptoms on whether the virus is seed-borne and transmissible to seedlings of cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) have been conflicting. Studies show that visible viral symptoms are not always manifested on all affected parts of infected cocoa trees due to a period of CSSV latency. In this work, molecular diagnostic techniques involving DNA and RNA based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods were utilised with CSSV primers designed from conserved regions of published CSSV sequences to investigate whether CSSV is sexually transmissible from infected parents to developing seeds and seedlings through a series of pollination experiments. The study also evaluated whether pollen could be a source of CSSV infection into seeds and seedlings through cross pollination experiments by using pollen from CSSV infected cocoa trees onto healthy recipients. Robust precautions were taken to avoid cross contamination during duplicated DNA extractions and only those PCR results accompanied by effective positive and negative controls (from CSSV symptomatic and quarantine assured CSSV free trees respectively) were scored. Following DNA extraction all pods obtained from the self pollination experiments involving CSSV infected cocoa trees were found to contain seeds that were PCR positive for CSSV DNA. The pith (mesocarp) of each of the self pollination generated pods was similarly PCR positive for CSSV DNA, though not all seeds from the pods were positive for the PCR screening. Seed components showed diminishing frequencies of CSSV DNA presence in the order: testa> cotyledon> embryo. Sequential DNA samples from new leaves of some of the seedlings derived from the self-pollinated trees are consistently PCR positive for CSSV DNA over 24 months after germination. Nonetheless, a reverse transcription (RT) PCR screening test has been negative for all those PCR positive seedlings indicating absence of CSSV RNA transcripts in the seedlings. None of the seedlings have exhibited symptoms characteristic of CSSV and infectivity tests on them have been negative. Seeds and seedlings from the cross pollination experiments have also been negative for the PCR analysis implying that pollen could not to be a potential route for CSSV infection. Possible explanations for these events including viral DNA integration into the cocoa genome and possible methylation-directed inactivation of the CSSV DNA are discussed.
