40|$|In {{an effort}} to improve {{productivity}} and profits many farmers have replaced traditional livestock breeds with higher yielding alternatives. While such changes may bring about short-term economic gains, the loss of traditional livestock breeds {{could result in the}} loss of an important genetic resource as a variety of important genetic traits adapted to local conditions gradually become less common in the population. This is a particular problem in Africa, where livestock make a substantial contribution to human livelihoods. Using the example of cattle in Kenya’s pastoral livestock markets this study uses a choice experiment approach to investigate buyers’ preferences for indigenous breeds such as the Maasai Zebu. The analysis employs a latent class approach to characterize heterogeneity in valuations both within and across respondents buying <b>cattle</b> <b>for</b> <b>breeding,</b> slaughter or resale. The results show that {{there are at least three}} classes of buyers with distinct preferences for cattle traits and that most buyers favor exotic rather than indigenous breeds. Such preferences have implications for the conservation of indigenous cattle in Kenya and in other developing countries and suggest that some form of intervention may be required to ensure the preservation of this important animal genetic resource. animal genetic resources; economic valuation; choice experiments; latent class models;indigenous livestock; Maasai Zebu cattle...|$|E

Fundamental to this has been the establishment of the central cattle breeding database, which allows ICBF quickly expand into new technological opportunities, e. g., EDIY milk recording, Handheld technology and Image data from abattoirs. In addition, a strong emphasis is placed on business partnerships, where the overall goal is to “add value ” to information collected on Irish cattle, by linking together systems from across the industry, e. g., marts and abattoirs.

40|$|AbstractDuring cytological {{analysis}} of microsporogenesis in 28 polyploid accessions of Brachiaria humidicola (Poaceae) from the Embrapa Beef <b>Cattle</b> germplasm collection <b>for</b> <b>breeding</b> purposes, cell fusions {{were recorded in}} two accessions and chromosome transfer among meiocytes in one of them. Cell fusion between two to more than ten cells was recorded from prophase I to telophase II. In the syncyte, each nucleus maintained its integrity. In one of these accessions, cytomixis with characteristics never reported in any other plant species was recorded. It occurred among very small meiocytes that transferred the entire genome or part of it to normal meiocytes. Chromosome transfer occurred preferentially during telophase I and, during migration, chromatin showed structural alteration. Both abnormalities compromise pollen fertility. In the Brachiaria genus, polyploid accessions are, in general, apomictic, albeit pseudogamous. Consequently, fertile pollen is essential to fertilize the central nucleus of the embryo sac and ensure viable seeds production. Thus, accessions with high frequencies of meiotic abnormalities might be eliminated early from the breeding program...|$|R

50|$|According to him, the Arabs {{were beyond}} the {{formation}} of “primitive patriarchal nomadism”; rather, they possessed a “developed”, modified cattle breeding economy. By the 7th century, Arabia suffered from a scarcity in land <b>for</b> <b>cattle</b> <b>breeding.</b> The Byzantine and Persian empires in the North, and the Persian and Ethiopian interventions in Yemen, resulted in an isolation ofCentral Arabia, {{as well as in}} a heightened competition for the available pastures. Due to this scarcity and competition, Arabtribes now occupied the oases and towns of the Hijaz, like Mecca and Medina, which had hitherto been inhabited mainly by Jews and other settled populations. The Arabic tribes that conquered these settlements took over the agricultural and merchant activities that had been in place. Some Bedouin tribes, like the Quraysh, thereforeturned into trading tribes. Due to the increased mutual raiding and warfare among cattle-breeders, more and more Arab nomads lost their livestock, settled around these settlements as pauperized and dependant clans, and took on agricultural work to make a living.|$|R
