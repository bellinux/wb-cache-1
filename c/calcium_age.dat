We also wanted to investigate whether (and if so, to what extent) calcium metabolism is altered by treatment with lithium or not. Therefore, a t test was used to compare both groups in terms of interesting laboratory parameters such as albumin-adjusted calcium, 25 -hydroxycholecalciferol, and intact parathyroid hormone. Pearson correlation coefficients and accordant test statistics with the parathyroid hormone concentration were calculated for albumin-adjusted <b>calcium,</b> <b>age,</b> 25 -hydroxycholecalciferol, lithium level, lithium dose, and duration of lithium therapy.|$|E
40|$|Objective—Complex {{atherosclerotic}} lesions contain radio-opaque {{calcium hydroxyapatite}} deposits with {{the degree of}} calcification correlating with the extent of atherosclerosis. In this study, we aim to determine the patterns of systemic atherosclerotic calcification. Methods and Results—Whole-body electron beam computed tomography scans were performed on 650 asymptomatic subjects to assess the carotid, coronary, proximal, and distal aorta and iliac vessels for atherosclerotic calcification. The mean age was 57. 3 and 53 % were male. Correlation patterns were similar in both genders, with the largest interbed correlations between the distal aorta and iliac vessels (r 0. 51 to 0. 60). The average man and woman had calcium earliest in the coronaries (younger than age 50 years) and the distal aorta (age 50 to 60), respectively. The prevalence of calcium was greater than 80 % for most beds in men older than age 70 and greater than 60 % in all beds for women. Approximately on third of subjects younger than 50 were free of calcified disease, whereas all subjects older than 70 {{were found to have}} some <b>calcium.</b> <b>Age</b> and hypertension were the dominant risk factors for systemic calcified atherosclerosis.

We therefore aimed {{to test the hypothesis}} that circulating markers of bone turnover correlate with LV function in a cohort of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT). Cross-sectional data of 155 subjects with pHPT were analyzed who participated in the "Eplerenone in Primary Hyperparathyroidism" (EPATH) Trial. Multivariate linear regression analyses with LV ejection fraction (LVEF, systolic function) or peak early transmitral filling velocity (e', diastolic function) as dependent variables and N-terminal propeptide of procollagen type 1 (P 1 NP), osteocalcin (OC), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP), or beta-crosslaps (CTX) as the respective independent variable were performed. Analyses were additionally adjusted for plasma parathyroid hormone, plasma <b>calcium,</b> <b>age,</b> sex, HbA 1 c, body mass index, mean 24 -hours systolic blood pressure, smoking status, estimated glomerular filtration rate, antihypertensive treatment, osteoporosis treatment, 25 -hydroxy vitamin D and N-terminal pro-brain B-type natriuretic peptide. Independent relationships were observed between P 1 NP and LVEF (adjusted β-coefficient = 0. 201, P = 0. 035) and e' (β = 0. 188, P = 0. 042), respectively. OC (β = 0. 192, P = 0. 039) and BALP (β = 0. 198, P = 0. 030) were each independently related with e'. CTX showed no correlations with LVEF or e'. In conclusion, high bone formation markers were independently and paradoxically related with better LV diastolic and, partly, better systolic function, in the setting of pHPT. Potentially cardio-protective properties of stimulated bone formation in the context of hyperparathyroidism should be explored in future studies...|$|E

The exposed alloys were characterized by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Optical Microscopy (OM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) techniques. The microstructural refinement due to <b>calcium</b> addition and <b>ageing</b> treatment results in the improvement of corrosion resistance of the experimental alloy. Corrosion rate decreases due to fine precipitation of the β (Mg 17 Al 12) phase distributed along the α-grain boundaries during ageing. Intermetallic phases act as a barrier, which makes the alloy more resistant to corrosion. Results found that better corrosion resistance of the alloy was observed in Mg– 6 Al– 1 Zn +  1. 5  wt. % Ca with 180  °C ageing temperature.

40|$|Impaired {{metabolism}} of {{high density}} lipoprotein in uremic patients. We measured lipoproteins, apolipoproteins, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), hepatic triglyceride lipase (HTGL), lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) and parameters of calcium metabolism {{to evaluate the}} roles of these enzymes and hypertriglyceridemia for impaired high-density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism in chronic renal failure, and to {{examine the impact of}} altered calcium homeostasis on the lipoprotein-regulating enzymes. The subjects were 25 healthy volunteers and 66 uremic patients, 24 treated with hemodialysis (HD) and 42 with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Lipoprotein analysis revealed: (1) reduction in HDL cholesterol especially in HDL 2 subfraction; (2) increase in HDL triglyceride; and (3) decreased ratio of HDL 2 cholesterol to HDL 3 cholesterol in both HD and CAPD patients. Simple regression analysis showed: (1) a positive correlation between VLDL triglyceride and triglycéride/cholestérol ratio of HDL; (2) positive correlations of LPL level in post-heparin plasma to cholesterol concentrations in HDL 2, HDL 3 and total HDL, and to apolipoproteins A-I and A-II; and (3) inverse correlations of HTGL to HDL 2 cholesterol and to the ratio of HDL 2 cholesterol/HDL 3 cholesterol. Multiple regression analysis of HDL cholesterol indicated positive association with LPL and inverse correlation with VLDL triglyceride. Four variables including LPL, HTGL, LCAT and VLDL triglyceride explained 51. 5 % of the variation of HDL cholesterol. HDL 2 cholesterol was associated positively with LPL and negatively with VLDL triglyceride in the model. HDL 3 cholesterol was associated positively with LPL, HTGL and LCAT and inversely with VLDL triglyceride. Stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that independent predictors of HTGL were gender, parathyroid hormone levels by a mid-portion assay, ionized <b>calcium</b> and <b>age,</b> and that those of LCAT were ionized <b>calcium</b> and <b>age.</b> These results suggest that elevated VLDL and alterations in the enzyme levels contributed to deranged HDL metabolism in uremic patients, and that changes in the enzyme levels were associated with impaired calcium homeostasis...|$|R

Measurements of adhering cells showed that adhesion to bovine serum albumin-, type IV collagen- or laminin 1 -coated plastic surfaces initially increased until donor age reached 30 y and then decreased. Specific adhesion to type IV collagen and laminin 1 did not vary with age, but the increase in adhesion to type IV collagen produced by manganese ions increased with age, suggesting an age-dependent feature of βl integrin. Synthesis of type VII collagen, increased or not by TGFβ 1 (10 ng per ml), did not vary with the donor age. Global normalized principal component analysis showed that variables related to integrins were strongly correlated, as were those of adhesion. Pre-embedding immunoelectron microscopy of freshly isolated keratinocytes showed that certain hemidesmosomes from aged cells had little or no reaction with anti-β 4 -chain antibody. Post-embedding type IV collagen immunostaining and image analysis showed less type IV collagen in adult dermo-epidermal junctions. These findings indicate that there are structural and functional changes in the dermo-epidermal junction components with aging, probably giving a less effective epidermal anchoring system.

The extracellular α-amylase was purified 48 -fold and was free of transglucosylase activity. The α-amylase (amylose substrate) required Cl− for maximum activity; ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) partially inhibited activity, but CaCl 2 prevented EDTA inhibition. The temperature optimum was 38 C at pH 7. 0, and the pH optimum was 7. 0 at 37 C {{in the presence of}} CaCl 2. Predominant final products of amylose hydrolysis, in order of decreasing prevalence, were maltose, maltotriose, maltotetraose, and glucose. The α-amylase showed no evidence of multiple attack.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} influence of gestational age, maternal, and neonatal variables on reference intervals for cord blood bone minerals (calcium, phosphate, magnesium) and related laboratory tests (alkaline phosphatase, and albumin-adjusted calcium), and to develop gestational age specific reference intervals based on infants without influential pathological conditions. Methods Cross-sectional study. 702 babies were identified as candidates for this study in a regional referral neonatal unit. After exclusions (for anomalies, asphyxia, maternal magnesium sulfate administration, and death), relationships were examined between cord blood serum laboratory analytes (calcium, phosphate, magnesium, alkaline phosphatase, and albumin-adjusted <b>calcium)</b> with gestation <b>age</b> and also with maternal and neonatal variables using multiple linear regression. Infants with influential pathological conditions were omitted from the development of gestational age specific reference intervals for the following categories: 23 - 27, 28 - 31, 32 - 34, 35 - 36 and > 36 weeks. Results Among the 506 preterm and 54 terms infants included in the sample. Phosphate, magnesium, and alkaline phosphatase in cord blood serum decreased with gestational <b>age,</b> <b>calcium</b> increased with gestational age. Those who were triplets, small for gestational age, and those whose mother had pregnancy-induced hypertension were influential for most of the analytes. The reference ranges for the preterm infants ≥ 36 weeks were: phosphate 1. 5 to 2. 6 mmol/L (4. 5 to 8. 0 mg/dL), calcium: 2. 1 to 3. 1 mmol/L (8. 3 to 12. 4 mg/dL); albumin-adjusted calcium: 2. 3 to 3. 2 mmol/L (9. 1 to 12. 9 mg/dL); magnesium 0. 6 to 1. 0 mmol/L (1. 4 to 2. 3 mg/dL), and alkaline phosphatase 60 to 301 units/L.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Fructus ligustri lucidi (FLL) is {{a widely}} used herb in China that is classically {{included}} in antiaging formulas {{for the treatment of}} age-related symptoms. Our laboratory previously showed that FLL could regulate calcium balance in young ovariectomized (OVX) rats. In the present study, we aimed to determine whether FLL could regulate <b>calcium</b> balance in <b>aged</b> OVX rats and to study the potential mechanisms that mediate its action in vivo. DESIGN: Aged OVX rats were orally administered an ethanol extract of FLL and its vehicle and fed with diets containing different levels of calcium [low calcium diet (LCD), 0. 1 % Ca; medium calcium diet (MCD), 0. 6 % Ca; and high calcium diet (HCD), 1. 2 % Ca] for 12 weeks. RESULTS: Significant reductions in urinary and fecal calcium excretion were found in the FLL-treated animals, resulting in a significant induction of calcium retention in rats fed with the MCD and HCD. FLL treatment significantly increased the serum 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 level and slightly decreased the serum parathyroid hormone level in OVX rats fed with the MCD and HCD. When OVX rats were challenged by LCD, the inductions of serum parathyroid hormone and 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 were decreased by FLL administration. FLL treatment significantly up-regulated duodenal vitamin D receptor and calcium transport protein 1 mRNA expression in rats fed with the HCD. FLL treatment reduced the expression of renal vitamin D receptor and 25 -hydroxyvitamin D- 24 -hydroxylase mRNA in OVX rats fed with the LCD and MCD. CONCLUSIONS: Twelve weeks of FLL treatment could reduce calcium loss, modulate the parathyroid hormone-vitamin D axis, and increase vitamin D-dependent <b>calcium</b> transport in <b>aged</b> OVX rats, suggesting that FLL might be useful as an alternative medicine for improving calcium balance in postmenopausal women.

40|$|Induction of {{heat shock}} {{proteins}} (hsp) most likely is a homeostatic mechanism {{in response to}} metabolic and environmental insults. We have investigated signal transduction mechanisms involved in alpha 1, adrenergic receptor stimulation of hsp 7 O gene expression in isolated aortas with age. We found that alpha 1 adrenergic agonists directly induced hsp 70 mRNA in rat aorta in vitro; the alpha 1, selective antagonist prazosin blocked this effect whereas chloroethylclonidine, an antagonist which has some selectivity for alpha 1 B receptors, was ineffective. This response was insensitive to pertussis toxin and was partially blocked by the protein kinase C inhibitor H 7. Removal of extracellular calcium attenuated induction of hsp 70 mRNA but not the induction of c-fos or c-myc. The induction of hsp 70 mRNA by either norepinephrine or by phorbol dibutyrate was blunted in aortas from old (24 - 27 mo) rats whereas c-fos responses were not diminished in the older vessels. The hsp 70 response to elevated temperature (42 degrees C) was not changed with age. Activation of hsp 70 expression most likely involves a pertussis toxin insensitive G protein which activates protein kinase C, and requires extracellular <b>calcium.</b> With <b>age,</b> hsp 70 gene expression induced by stimulation of alpha 1 adrenergic receptors is markedly attenuated, which could modify responses to stress or vascular injury with aging...|$|R

40|$|SummaryIn the {{neurology}} literature it is {{well established}} that anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) lead to bone loss (osteopenia and osteoporosis). Several large epidemiologic studies have found twice the fracture rate in persons with epilepsy compared to the non-epilepsy population. While an increasing level of awareness for preventative measures and screening by neurologists and primary care physicians are recommended, so far no one has attempted to address how knowledge related to calcium and exercise, health beliefs (based on the Health Belief Model) and self-efficacy (confidence in abilities) impact osteoprotective behaviors in epilepsy, based on the Precaution Adoption Process Model (PAPM). The seven-stage PAPM, unlike other health behavior theories where a person is either practicing or not practicing the behavior, conceptualizes behavior change as dynamic and occurring over time. Validated instruments {{were used to assess}} knowledge, health beliefs, self-efficacy and stages of the precaution adoption process for four osteoprotective behaviors.

Half of the birds in each age group were chilled 24 hr in slush ice, {{and the other half}} were hot packed. Immediately after processing, skin was removed from the legs and the {{composite}} sample analyzed for moisture, protein, fat, ash, and elemental composition. Moisture in broiler skin decreased with age of the bird, while fat content increased. Nonchilled skin also had a higher moisture and ash content than chilled skin. Percent protein remained rather constant as the birds increased in <b>age.</b> <b>Calcium,</b> potassium, and sulfur contents were not affected by age or chill method, but nonchilled skin had higher magnesium and sodium levels. The 3 -week-old broilers had significantly greater phosphorus than broilers of other ages. (Key words: broiler, composition, broiler skin, age, chilling...|$|R
40|$|Bone {{health is}} an {{important}} issue in <b>aging.</b> <b>Calcium</b> and vitamin D currently have the most focus in published research on nutrition and bone health in aging, although evidence from published research is not conclusive. A systematic review was conducted to determine the impact of dietary and supplemental interventions focused on calcium and vitamin D over the past 10 years. Using key words to search, and search limits (aging population, English), 62 papers were found related to diet, nutrition, and bone; and 157 were found related to calcium and bone. Our review found a positive effect on bone health for supplements; food-based interventions; and educational strategies. Although there may be a publishing bias related to non-significant findings not being published, our results suggest the effectiveness of food based and educational interventions with less economic impact to the individual, as well as less risk of physiological side effects occurring...|$|R
40|$|Background: Clinical {{guidelines}} emphasize {{risk assessment}} as vital to patient selection for medical primary intervention. However, risk assessment methods are restricted {{in their ability}} to predict further coronary events. The most widely accepted tool in the United States is the Framingham risk score. In these equations age is a powerful risk factor. Although the extent of coronary atherosclerosis increases with age, there is large inter-individual variability in the rate of development and progression of this disease. This fact limits the utility of Framingham scoring when applied to individuals. Electron beam tomography (EBT), which measures coronary calcium, provides a non-invasive method for assessing coronary plaque burden, thus offering the possibility of providing a more accurate estimate of an individual 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 arterial age 2 ̆ 2 than from chronological age alone. Methods: In this paper we discuss a new and simple method for incorporating the coronary calcium score (CCS) to modify the Framingham Risk Assessment (FRA). Using this method, a coronary artery <b>calcium</b> (CAC) <b>age</b> equivalent is generated that replaces chronological age in Framingham scoring. Results and discussion: Using a percentile table of CCS scores by age group and sex, individuals are matched to the <b>age</b> group whose <b>calcium</b> score most closely approximates their own individual score. The original 10 -year absolute risk score of a 65 -year old man with a CCS of 6 based on chronological age is 10...|$|R
40|$|MyPyramid is a {{guide to}} help people of any age plan a healthy diet. As we age, we need to plan more {{carefully}} the food that we choose {{in order to stay}} healthy. Individual calorie and nutrient needs change over time. This series of Putting MyPyramid on Your Table can help you choose foods that fit into a daily food plan to maintain good health. <b>Calcium</b> As we <b>age,</b> our need for calcium increases. Men and women over age 50 should consume at least 1, 200 milligrams of calcium a day to help maintain bone mass and reduce the risk of osteoporosis. One cup of milk provides about 300 milligrams of calcium. Studies have shown that calcium offers many other health benefits and may {{play an important role in}} reducing the risk for high blood pressure and obesity.

40|$|International audienceThe carrageenan-induced {{stabilization}} and gelation of ultra-high-temperature-treated milk was studied during long storage. Severe heating (causing increased protein denaturation), lowering of the pH, {{or the use}} of kappa-carrageenan (instead of kappa-carrageenan) led to excessive gelation. It is suggested that the balance between carrageenan-carrageenan interactions and carrageenan-protein interactions determines the gel strength. If the interactions between carrageenan and proteins are decreased, more carrageenan is available for carrageenan-carrageenan interactions, leading to a stronger gel. This is the case if kappa-carrageenan is used instead of kappa-carrageenan because the former forms weaker interactions with proteins than the latter. Also, heating and pH influence the attachment of whey proteins to the casein micelle surface, hindering the attachment of carrageenan to the casein proteins. Upon storage, gel strength increased. Particle size and rheology measurements indicated that upon storage, tenuous carrageenan-protein aggregates are formed. The firming of the gel was probably related to slow structural arrangements of the gel and not related to slowly changing <b>calcium</b> equilibria or <b>age</b> gelation...|$|R
40|$|Predictors of distal and {{proximal}} forearm bone density, {{measured by}} photon absorbtiometry, were investigated in 248 premenopausal women aged 39 - 56 years. Only one strong predictor of lower bone density was found [...] history of previous fracture at any site (P less than 0. 001). Two other factors showed a weaker association with density, {{but only at}} the distal site [...] history of diuretic use showed a positive association (P less than 0. 02) whereas alkaline phosphatase level was inversely correlated with density (P less than 0. 01). Other factors were not significant predictors: these included <b>age,</b> <b>calcium</b> intake, level of exercise, anthropometric measures of obesity, serum calcium level, parity, lactation history, a menopausal symptom history, use of the contraceptive pill, smoking and alcohol intake. These results contrast with the far stronger predictors found for postmenopausal women and suggest that genetic endowment rather than lifestyle may be the major determinant of bone density before the menopause...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{meta-analysis}} {{of the most}} representative Spanish nutrition studies was carried out to identify inadequate intakes of vitamins A, B 1, B 6, C, E, folate, iron, and <b>calcium</b> in children <b>aged</b> 4 to 18. Information on vegetable, fruit and fruit juice/beverage intake was also solicited. Data drawn from the selected studies yielded a total of 6540 children and adolescents in eight geographical areas. The sample was stratified by age (children: 4 to 14 years old and adolescents: 13 – 18 years old) and sex. Inadequate intakes (below two-thirds of the recommended values) were notable in children for vitamin E, vitamin C, and vitamin A and in girls, iron. In adolescents, low intakes were especially marked for vitamin E and vitamin A, and in girls, calcium, folate, and iron. Adolescents consumed more vegetables, fruit juice, and fruit drinks whereas children had higher fruit intakes. Regional differences in consumption were also detected. Strategies for improving nutrient intake in these vulnerable populations are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the quantity of calcium intake among adults, the sources of calcium, differences among seasons, as well as the differences between sexes, correlation with body mass index (BMI), and age. The study included 161 healthy volunteers from the eastern part of Croatia. Each subject completed three food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) with 150 items, at an interval of 3 – 4 months. The mean calcium intake for whole population for all three FFQs was 965 mg/day. At the same time, the quantity of calcium for all subjects was 14. 2 mg/kg, women 14. 5 mg/kg, and men 13. 6 mg/kg, respectively. There was an inverse relation between <b>calcium</b> intake and <b>age</b> for men (r=– 0. 32 p= 0. 028), but not for women. Correlation between calcium intake and BMI was negative, but not significantly. Milk and dairy products were the main source of calcium. Marginally low mean calcium intake goes to show the needful to educate the population...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This study {{attempted}} {{to determine the}} prognostic value for survival of various pretreatment characteristics in patients with nonresectable non-small-cell lung cancer {{in the context of}} more than 10 years of experience of a European Cooperative Group, Patients and Methods: We included in the analysis all eligible patients (N = 1, 052) with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer registered onto one of seven trials conducted by the European Lung Cancer Working party (ELCWP) during one decode, The patients were treated by chemotherapy regimens based on platinum derivatives. We prospectively collected 23 variables and analyzed them by univariate and multivariate methods. Results: The global estimated median survival time was 29 weeks, with a 95 % confidence interval of 27 to 30 weeks. After univariate analysis, we applied two multivariate statistical techniques. In a Cox regression model, the selected explanatory variables were disease extent, Karnofsky performance status, WBC and neutrophil counts, metastatic involvement of skin, serum <b>calcium</b> level, <b>age,</b> and sex. These results were confirmed by application of recursive partitioning and amalgamation algorithms (RECPAM), which led to classification of the patients into four homogeneous subgroups. Conclusion: We confirmed by our analysis the role of well-known independent prognostic factors for survival, but also identified the effect of the neutrophil count, rarely studied, with the use of two methods: a classical Cox regression model and a RECPAM analysis. The classification of patients into the four subgroups we obtained needs to be validated in other series. (C) 1995 by American Society of Clinical Oncology...|$|R
