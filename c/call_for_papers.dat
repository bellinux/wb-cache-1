2500|$|At the 2004 Annual Conference of the American Culture Association, their <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>papers</b> was {{specifically}} about such conspiracy theories {{relating to the}} Templars and their association with other legends and mysterious organizations. [...] Literary theorists puzzle over Umberto Eco's use in his novel Foucault's Pendulum, of the Templars {{as a symbol of}} postmodernist rewriting of history. Historian Malcolm Barber writes that [...] "Mystic Templars are omnipresent in all good conspiracy theories." [...] On Day to Day, a program on American NPR, host Alex Chadwick discussed [...] "the literary fascination with the Knights Templar." [...] In Poland, the Toruń Museum had an exhibition entitled [...] "The Knights Templar - History and Myth" [...] which offered a description, [...] "Apart from pieces of [...] "high art", the exhibit will grant equal importance to [...] "popular culture" [...] items (literature, film, Internet content) exploring the subject of the Knights Templar." [...] And in 2007, a National Post editorial noted that [...] "the Templars remain a living presence in popular culture. This has happened precisely because the historical record concerning their sudden annihilation in the early-14th century at the hands of Philip IV ("the Fair") of France has been so sparse and ambiguous. [...] Time and revolution have damaged and dispersed the sources, and made the Templars a magnet for speculation and imagination." ...|$|E
