50|$|Chatlines {{are most}} {{popular in the}} United States and Canada as an {{alternative}} to online dating. Some of the most popular chatlines include QuestChat, Livelinks and Fonochat. Both male and female callers dial in and through a common access number. As soon as a caller is connected into the system, he is prompted to record his name and a brief greeting describing himself and what he is looking for. The phone systems will usually allow users hear a <b>chatline</b> greeting example so the caller can get an idea of what he is expected to say. Profanity and sexual references are typically not allowed, the <b>chatline</b> moderator's job is to listen and approve every greeting that is recorded. Once the greeting is recorded, the caller is allowed into the live chat area (or live connector).|$|E
40|$|Online {{paedophile}} {{activity in}} social media {{has become a major}} concern in society as Internet access is easily available to a broader younger population. One common form of online child exploitation is child grooming, where adults and minors exchange sexual text and media via social media platforms. Such behaviour involves a number of stages performed by a predator (adult) with the final goal of approaching a victim (minor) in person. This paper presents a study of such online grooming stages from a machine learning perspective. We propose to characterise such stages by a series of features covering sentiment polarity, content, and psycho-linguistic and discourse patterns. Our experiments with online chatroom conversations show good results in automatically classifying <b>chatlines</b> into various grooming stages. Such a deeper understanding and tracking of predatory behaviour is vital for building robust systems for detecting grooming conversations and potential predators on social media...|$|R
40|$|Objectives Suicide is {{the tenth}} {{leading cause of}} death in the US, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has labeled more than 125 {{prescription}} drugs for potential adverse effects of suicidal ideation and behavior. Several are in the top 200 for highest dispensed volume, including the entire class of antiepileptics. Also included are drugs used to treat urinary incontinence, an antibiotic, and smoking cessation agents. We describe the importance of pharmacists 2 ̆ 7 identification and management of these complex adverse events and conclude with the potential for Department of Veterans Affairs and other big data longitudinal clinical research projects to provide additional insight into the complex causes of this adverse event. Summary Questions persist about causality (pharmacologic provocation of suicide) in the context of psychiatric treatment response (treatment emergence) and the multifactorial pathogenesis of suicidal behavior, which is distinct from suicidal ideation. In the future, big data with the use of medical records (rather than claims) may provide valuable insights into this question. Conclusion Pharmacists are encouraged to file adverse event reports for suicide and suicide attempts resulting in death, disability, or hospitalization via MedWatch even if the reports are incomplete. Resources to support pharmacists managing patients at risk include hotlines, <b>chatlines,</b> texting, and free federally funded online training...|$|R
50|$|Many people confuse phone chat {{lines with}} adult {{hotlines}} or phone sex lines, {{so it is}} worth it to clarify the difference. Unlike phone sex lines, the users on a <b>chatline</b> are not professionals phone sex operators (PSOs). Foul language and sexual references are prohibited on recorded greetings and private messages.|$|E
50|$|Chatlines: Users could post {{messages}} that other users {{could see and}} respond to. Celebrity <b>Chatline</b> was a weekly feature conceived by Publisher Ian Rock and implemented by Sid Smith in which a prominent person was interviewed by Micronet users whose questions appeared onscreen, with Micronet personnel usually typing the answers (if the 'celebrity' couldn't type or format the text themselves). Early 'celebrities' included Sir Clive Sinclair, Feargal Sharkey, Fatima Whitbread and Lord Cardigan.|$|E

Thwaites {{is shown to}} have romantic history with the {{headmistress}} of St Trinian’s, Camilla Fritton (Rupert Everett). Annabelle is forced to face her former bullies, including captain Verity Thwaites (Lucy Punch). The hockey match is violent, ending in Kelly shooting a winning goal for St Trinians, which {{is followed by a}} brawl between the two schools. As the match is being played, Geoffrey Thwaites inspects the school, finding the illegal vodka-making business and the <b>chatline</b> being run by the Posh Totty clique.|$|E
50|$|Mo, who {{previously}} lived in Walford, returns there after almost forty years away, with her son-in-law, Charlie Slater (Derek Martin) and granddaughters, Lynne Hobbs (Elaine Lordan), Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace), Little Mo Morgan (Kacey Ainsworth) and Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan). Mo's rivalry with her former best friend Pat Butcher (Pam St. Clement) arises, but they reconcile at Mo's former husband and Pat's brother, Jimmy Harris's (Alex King) grave. Much of Mo's {{time is spent}} selling poor quality stolen goods and she trades with Fat Elvis (Shenton Dixon). She is assisted by Mickey (Joe Swash) and Darren Miller (Charlie G. Hawkins) {{and for a while}} sets up a sex <b>chatline.</b> She also works with Charlie's great-niece, Stacey (Lacey Turner), on her market stall, selling clothes. She has a brief relationship with Bert Atkinson (Dave Hill), but ends it because Bert is also seeing her friend, Ina Foot (Ina Clare). They reconcile, but break up again when Bert's ex-wife, Evie (Marji Campi), arrives in Walford, terminally ill. Mo begins selling cigarettes that she bought in Spain and two of her customers turn out to be Revenue and Customs officers. She is sentenced to 100 hours of community service, for tax evasion. After Stacey marries Bradley Branning (Charlie Clements), Mo tries to sell their wedding gifts.|$|E
40|$|Beyond {{their common}} use for {{interpersonal}} communication, chatlines (also chatrooms) can be formalised as dynamic systems with heuristics. We have studied chatlines {{in the framework}} of social networks. The design and data analysis of chatlines opens a new interesting research direction in social network studies. It provides the opportunity of studying the dynamics of human social behaviour in experimental ?controlled? (or nearly controlled) conditions. Our study aims to point out both the analogy with physical systems of interacting objects and the social network emerging properties linked to the existence of different communication patterns and usage of different heuristics in the participants. We describe guidelines for effective implementation of a <b>chatline</b> in controlled experimental conditions. We identified several parameters which represent meaningfull statistical estimators of the activity of the network and we computed the correlation of these parameters and measures of network statistics...|$|E
40|$|International audienceME (Myalgic Encephalomyelitis) or CFS (chronic fatigue syndrome) is a {{debilitating}} illness {{for which no}} cause or medical tests have been identified. Debates over its nature have generated interest from qualitative researchers. However, participants are difficult to recruit {{because of the nature}} of their condition. Therefore, this study explores the utility of the internet as a means of eliciting accounts. We analyse data from focus groups and the internet in order to ascertain the extent to which previous research findings apply to the internet domain. Interviews were conducted among 49 members of internet groups (38 <b>chatline,</b> 11 personal) and 7 members of two face-to-face support groups. Discourse analysis of descriptions and accounts of ME or CFS revealed similar devices and interactional concerns in both internet and face-to-face communication. Participants constructed their condition as serious, enigmatic and not psychological. These functioned to deflect problematic assumptions about ME or CFS and to manage their accountability for the illness and its effects...|$|E
