40|$|Quick {{test for}} quality check of {{processed}} food will be handy for Defence Forces. Acidity {{being one of}} the most important quality parameters, as per the ASC, BIS, PFA specifications, limits have been laid down as not to exceed 2 per cent in meat and fish products, 0. 1 per cent in cereal products, 1. 25 per cent in ice <b>cream</b> <b>powder,</b> 1. 5 per cent in milk powder, 0. 3 per cent in sweetened condensed milk, and 0. 15 per cent in butter. In the present study, a simple, quick, semi-quantitative test has been developed for checking acidity in processed foods to ascertain their quality. The test is based on a colour reaction with the sample. The test solution gives blue to green to yellow colour depending on the concentration of acid in the sample. Green colour is the cut-off point for non-acceptance. The large number of samples of meat (155), fish products (48), cereal products (222), ice <b>cream</b> <b>powder</b> (200), butter (200), milk powder (200) and sweetened condensed milk (202) were analysed by the quick test method and the results were compared with those from the standard titrimetric method. Acidity ranged form 0. 68 per cent to 2. 40 per cent in meat products, 0. 70 per cent to 2. 50 per cent in fish products, 0. 06 per cent to 1. 25 per cent in butter, 0. 60 per cent to 1. 91 per cent in milk powder, 0. 05 per cent to 0. 54 per cent in ice <b>cream</b> <b>powder,</b> 0. 32 per cent to 0. 60 per cent in sweatened condensed milk, 0. 05 per cent to 1. 10 per cent in cereal products. Some samples were found to be unacceptable having acidity more than the specified limits. The data were analysed statistically and the quick test was found to correlate very well with the standard titrimetric method...|$|E
40|$|Lipid {{oxidation}} in <b>cream</b> <b>powder</b> and {{rapeseed oil}} was studied at different oxygen {{concentrations in the}} presence or absence of the catalytic factors light and copper. The oxygen concentrations in the headspace of the product ranged from 21 % down to 0. 03 %, but particular emphasis was laid on oxygen concentrations below 2 %. Lipid oxidation was followed by measuring oxygen consumption, hydroperoxide production, tocopherol consumption and production of secondary oxidation products. Oxygen consumption and hexanal production in both <b>cream</b> <b>powder</b> and rapeseed oil were found to be influenced by oxygen concentration changes almost in the whole concentration range studied. However, the influence of oxygen concentration changes decreased with increasing oxygen concentration. Hexanal production was more influenced by oxygen concentration changes at levels between 2 and 21 % than was oxygen consumption. This result showed that not only hydroperoxide production but also the further production of secondary oxidation products is dependent on the oxygen concentration. Oxygen concentration had a large impact on the rate of oxidation for samples stored in light or in the presence of copper. Thus, for samples stored in the presence of catalytic factors, such as light or copper, it is especially important to keep the oxygen concentration as low as possible, in order to maintain the quality of the product. The production of secondary oxidation products in rapeseed oil was related to oxygen concentration in different ways. At 50 °C, most aldehydes, alcohols and ketones were produced in lower amounts at decreasing oxygen concentrations. However, the alkanes measured were produced in higher amounts with decreasing oxygen concentrations. At 35 °C, some compounds that were positively correlated to oxygen concentration at 50 °C were instead found to be negatively correlated. Small differences between <b>cream</b> <b>powder</b> samples stored at different oxygen concentrations below 2 %, which could be detected by hexanal analysis, could not be detected by sensory analysis. However, even samples stored at 0. 03 % oxygen showed flavour changes compared to a non-stored sample after 25 weeks of storage. Since the rate of lipid oxidation in all products studied in this thesis was influenced by oxygen concentration in almost the whole oxygen concentration range studied, a decrease in oxygen concentration will almost certainly lead to better storage stability of the product. Changes below 1 % will, however, have a larger relative effect on the rate of oxidation than changes above this level. For slow-oxidising samples, there will probably only be small differences in flavour between samples stored at different oxygen concentrations below 2 %. The time to reach the end of shelf life will, however, be much longer for samples stored at oxygen concentrations below 0. 1 %...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this work}} was to develop frozen yogurt {{formulations}} from powdered yogurt of sheep milk, through an experimental design of 2 ², with a triplicate at the central point. The variables studied were emulsifier/stabilizer (0. 50 %, 0. 75 %, and 1. 00 %) and powder for cream (2. 75 %, 3. 00 % and 3. 25 %). The parameters evaluated were sensory characteristics, texture, and microbiological counts. The {{results showed that the}} formulations had counts of S. aureus and fecal coliforms at 45 °C, lactic acid bacteria and Salmonella sp within the limits established by legislation. Instrumental analysis of texture-related parameters (firmness, cohesiveness, adhesiveness, and consistency) of the formulations with different concentrations of emulsifier/stabilizer and <b>cream</b> <b>powder</b> showed no significant differences (p > 0. 05). In sensory analysis, Formulations 3 and 4 with lower concentrations of emulsifier/stabilizer scored the highest values, thus indicating good acceptability...|$|E

40|$|Changes in the {{consumption}} {{habits of the}} population forces food industry to produce traditional products in modern ways, sometimes not {{taking into account the}} modified safety issues. The aim of this study has been to compare hazards and critical control points for traditional and industrial cremeschnitte production. The result shows that the traditional cremeschnitte production includes two additional critical control points, cooking and moulding of egg cream basis, which is essential for safety. In addition, the results of microbial analysis pointed out that the traditional cremeschnitte is safer than the industrial one produced from dried <b>cream</b> <b>powder</b> when comparing Escherichia coli, total aerobic count, and mould contamination (P< 0. 05). Moreover, our controlled contamination test with E. coli of raw material shows that the traditional cremeschnitte production process reduces microbiological hazard even in the worst-case scenario.

40|$|Dental caries is {{a highly}} {{prevalent}} disease caused by colonisation of tooth surfaces by cariogenic bacteria, such as Streptococcus sobrinus and Streptococcus salivarius. Reducing initial adherence of such bacteria to teeth may delay onset of caries. Many foods, such as milk, can inhibit microbial adherence. In this investigation, the effect of untreated (UT) and enzyme-treated (ET) dairy powders on adherence of S. sobrinus and S. salivarius to hydroxylapatite (HA), an analogue of tooth enamel, was examined. Untreated (UT) acid whey protein concentrate (AWPC) 80 inhibited streptococcal adherence to phosphate-buffered saline-coated HA (PBS-HA) and saliva-coated HA (S-HA) by > 80 % at ⩾ 31. 25 μg mL− 1. UT sweet WPC 80, buttermilk powder and <b>cream</b> <b>powder</b> also significantly reduced adherence (P < 0. 05). Enzyme-treatment of all dairy powders reduced their anti-adhesion activity. However, ET sweet WPC 80 significantly inhibited growth of these streptococci (P < 0. 05) at ⩾ 0. 6 mg mL− 1. Therefore, dairy powders may reduce progression of dental caries by their anti-adhesion and/or antibacterial activity...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the inhibitory effect of various dairy powders and milk constituents on the adhesion of a clinical isolate of Streptococcus mutans to hydroxylapatite (HA), an analogue of tooth enamel. Adhesion of a microorganism to a cell surface such as epithelial cells or tooth enamel is considered to be the first step in pathogenesis. Inhibiting this process may have therapeutic effects in vivo. The adherence assays were performed by incubating S. mutans with HA in the presence of each test material for 45 min, followed by centrifugal separation of the HA. Unbound bacteria were then quantified using a fluorescent dye. Sweet and Acid WPC 80, buttermilk powder and <b>cream</b> <b>powder</b> were found to very effectively inhibit adherence of S. mutans to phosphate-buffered saline coated HA (PBS-HA). Sodium caseinate and the casein fractions a-,b- and j-casein were also found to show high levels of anti-adhesive activity. A selection of test materials were assessed using saliva-coated HA (S-HA), and similar trends were observed. The results suggest commercial dairy powders, and certain milk proteins, can inhibit adhesion of S. mutans to HA and may have potential to control dental caries...|$|E
40|$|Phenylketonuria (PKU) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prevalent}} types of hereditary metabolic disorders which is caused due to an absence or reduction of the activity of the Phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme in the liver which in turn, inhibits the transformation of phenylalanine (Phe) to tyrosine. In clinical terms, this disorder is displayed with severe, permanent and irreversible mental retardation. This research was aimed at development of a highly nutrient and acceptable suitable analogue Kefir drink for these patients. The mentioned drink is based on milk permeate, <b>cream</b> <b>powder</b> and includes glycomacropeptide (GMP) as a source of protein, starter as a fermentation source, the trance glutamines (TG) enzyme, dough stabilizer and modified corn starch as tissue maker, salt and water. The GMP used in this analogue drink is intended for enrichment of the product and therefore it was added by 3 % to one formula. The aforementioned sample had a lower calculated amount of pH and alcohol percentage in comparison with the 16 samples which did not have GMP. The results of this study showed that the analog kefir has a low level of phenylalanine (30. 40 mg/ 100 g) and in that regard, it can be considered to be useful for patients with PKU...|$|E
40|$|Dental caries is {{a common}} {{bacterial}} infection, but the progression of this disease can be delayed by preventing initial attachment of cariogenic bacteria such as Streptococcus mutans to tooth surfaces. This study firstly compares the effect of untreated (UT) and enzyme-treated (ET) dairy powders on the adherence of S. mutans to hydroxylapatite (HA), an analogue of tooth enamel. A fluorescence-based method was used to quantify adherence of S. mutans to HA both in the presence (S-HA) and absence (PBS-HA) of saliva. Secondly, binding of proteins present in the test materials to HA was quantified using bicinchonic acid assays and SDS-PAGE. In addition, the effect of UT and ET dairy powders on growth of S. mutans was examined using an optical-density based assay. UT acid whey protein concentrate (WPC) 80, sweet WPC 80, buttermilk powder (BMP) and <b>cream</b> <b>powder</b> (CP) significantly (P < 0. 05) inhibited adhesion of S. mutans at ≥ 31. 25 μg mL− 1 in the presence and absence of saliva. ET dairy powders were less effective inhibitors of adhesion, but ET sweet WPC 80 significantly (P < 0. 05) inhibited growth of S. mutans at ≥ 0. 6 mg mL− 1. Therefore, due to their adherence- and growth-inhibitory properties, dairy powders may be beneficial {{in the treatment of}} dental caries...|$|E
