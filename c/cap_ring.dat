50|$|The {{original}} full-sized Duofold {{was soon}} {{joined by the}} smaller Duofold Junior, Duofold Special, and Lady Duofold. While the Junior and special could also be fitted with Parker’s Washer Clip, the Lady Duofold was available with a Chatelaine, or Ring Top for hanging around one's neck. The Ring Top would also appear on Parker's Vest Pocket models, for being attached to a watch fob. Matching pencils would come with either clip or ring, depending on the pen selected. The pen was available only in black and red hard rubber until 1926, when Parker introduced the “unbreakable Permanite” Duofold (Permanite was Parker’s trade name for a plastic manufactured by DuPont). The first new hue was the now traditional red, followed by Jade green (made to compete with Sheaffer's revolutionary Jade Radite Lifetime pens) which was not originally {{referred to as a}} Duofold, but rather the Black Tipped Jade (changed shortly thereafter). This was followed by Lapis Lazuli blue and Mandarin Yellow. In 1928, Moderne black and pearl (black lined pearl) was introduced as a Deluxe model and Parker signified this by the addition of a third <b>cap</b> <b>ring</b> to the cap band instead of the usual two found at the time. In 1930 the Duofold line was streamlined with tapered ends replacing the familiar “flat-top” style. Additional varieties were introduced: burgundy (red and black pearl); Moderne green and pearl (green lined pearl); and finally, green and black pearl (black lined green pearl).|$|E

5000|$|... ==History== A cap gun is a toy {{gun that}} creates a loud sound {{simulating}} a gunshot and {{a puff of smoke}} when the percussion cap is exploded. Cap guns were originally made of cast iron, but after World War II were made of zinc alloy, and most newer models are made of plastic. The [...] "Golden Age" [...] of cap guns was roughly a 20-year period following World War II when television became popular and such companies as Nichols, Hubley, Kenton, Kilgore, Wyandotte, Classy, Mattel, Actoy, Esquire, George Schmidt, and Stevens made millions of cap guns in various versions. While many had their names patterned after a hero or heroine, many cap guns also were named with western-sounding names, like: [...] "Stallion 45", [...] "Pony", [...] "Mustang", [...] "Pioneer", [...] "Cowboy", [...] "Texan", [...] "Colt 45", [...] "Rodeo", and such.Ring cap guns are usually modelled after revolver pistols, with the <b>cap</b> <b>ring</b> placed in the cylinder section of the toy gun. Like its real-world counterpart, when the trigger is pulled, the cylinder rotates a new cap into place, the hammer is drawn back, and then released; the shock causes the cap to explode harmlessly, producing the noise and smoke.Strip or paper cap guns use the aforementioned cap strip in lieu of the <b>cap</b> <b>ring.</b> As in the ring style of gun, each pull of the trigger advances the cap strip forward, pulls back the hammer {{to the point where it}} releases, striking the cap.Potato or spud guns occasionally use a cap to provide a burst of gas to fire the projectile, a small cutting of potato. One design employs a small reusable metal [...] "cartridge" [...] which has a recess for a cap at one end and a small drilling through to the other end, which holds the potato. Due to the low energy contained in a paper cap and the poor seal around the cartridge, these spud guns usually have very modest range, barely enough to eject the potato cutting.Mattel introduced a modified type of roll cap that used sprocket feed instead of simple friction feed.Today, cap guns and other toy guns in the United States must be manufactured with a bright orange, red, or yellow tip placed over the [...] "muzzle" [...] of the cap gun, or with the entire gun made in these or other bright colors. Laws requiring these markings were made because of incidents where civilians - usually children or teenagers - were killed by police officers when the officers thought they saw real guns. While these incidents were rare, lawmakers decided that toy guns must be marked so they cannot be mistaken for real guns.2 It is also possible to commit acts of robbery with a replica gun, since no shots need to be fired from a gun that looks real.There are many collectors throughout the world who collect all types of cap guns, even though restrictive laws in some areas may make it difficult. Whereas the toy guns brought small prices originally, they now command significant prices for many models, with some of the most famous sets of holsters, guns and original boxes selling for high prices at auctions and toy gun shows. Some collectors will collect all types of cap guns, but many collectors specialize in either guns named after a famous western hero or a particular company's set, like the Nichols Industries or Hubley cap guns.Caps have occasionally been used in toys other than cap guns where an explosive effect is desired. One example would be the [...] "Thunder Punch" [...] version of the He-Man action figure from the original 1980s Masters of the Universe toy line. Ring caps were placed in a [...] "backpack" [...] integrated into the figure, which contained the striking mechanism for the caps (as well as tiny vents to allow smoke from a triggered cap to escape). This mechanism was triggered by drawing the figure's spring-loaded right arm back and releasing it to swing forward; the explosion of the cap was intended to simulate a thunderous noise caused by the superhuman power of the character's punch. Another example is a relatively new type of Airsoft, called Hybrid Guns. Hybrid guns use small round BBs in the tip of a casing, usually designed to mimic that of its respective magazine. The caps are placed behind the casing. In electric models, the caps are burst, and the pressure is used to propel the BB forward in a manner similar to real firearms. The leftover energy is then sometimes put to use simulating recoil and a blowback system that ejects the casings Another use is in so-called [...] "cap bombs"; devices roughly in the shape of an aerial bomb that contain a firing mechanism in the nose capable of holding a single cap, either plastic or paper (cut from a strip), though types are not interchangeable due to the mutually exclusive design. With the newer designs they have both the paper cap or plastic cap. When dropped they hit a hard surface and explode.|$|E

5000|$|The {{tamper-evident}} band (also {{known as}} the pilfer-proof ring -however considered a misnomer given that pilfering is still technically possible) is a plastic or metal ring that is often found attached below a screw cap in bottles, connected by thin bridges. They can be molded along with the cap or slit afterwards. [...] When unscrewing the <b>cap,</b> the <b>ring</b> breaks: the ring can separate from the cap, and two separate pieces remain, the sealing piece and the leftover ring; or the broken ring can form a [...] "pigtail" [...] still attached to the <b>cap.</b> [...] The <b>ring</b> therefore is a tamper warning: if the seal between the <b>ring</b> and the <b>cap</b> is broken, it {{is an indication that}} the cap has been opened.|$|R

40|$|A {{study is}} made of certain {{elementary}} source distributions {{on the surface of}} a rigid sphere for a fairly extensive range of frequencies. The elementary systems considered consist of a point source, uniformly vibrating <b>caps</b> and <b>rings,</b> and plane line sources.

Combinations of the elementary <b>rings</b> and <b>caps</b> are examined with a view to producing desired directional patterns and the results for a particular directional beam are presented. Taking a sphere {{as a model for the}} human head, the results for a point source are used to examine possible mechanisms for the binaural localization of sources of sound. These results indicate that, due to non-linear variation of phase with frequency, a pulsed sound should appear in a somewhat different form at each ear. It is suggested that localization is achieved by the brain in reconciling such pulse forms and that time and intensity differences are elements in a much more general process. Another possible application of the results involves the particular line source considered which could be taken to represent a human mouth...|$|R

The aim of the proposed research work {{was to develop a}} novel dual-compartment capsule (NDCC) with polymeric disc for gastroretentive dosage form, which will ultimately result in better solubility and bioavailability of Ofloxacin. Floating <b>ring</b> <b>caps</b> were formulated by using different natural polymers, separating ring band and swellable polymer located at the bottom of capsule. Formulated <b>ring</b> <b>caps</b> were assessed for coating thickness, In vitro buoyancy, In vitro drug release, release kinetics and stability studies.

Developed formulation demonstrated considerably higher drug release up to 9 hrs. The developed formulation FE 2 depicted the drug release according to Korsmeyer-Peppas model. There was not any significant change in performance characteristics of developed <b>ring</b> <b>caps</b> after subjecting them to stability studies.

50|$|The exact {{origins of}} the art of khanandas have not been studied {{thoroughly}} however it is likely that it emerged during the urbanization in the medieval epoch.

With Persian being the main language of the local literature at the time (mugham lyrics were based on Classical Islamic poetry), khanandas used it in their performance and therefore gained popularity mostly among the aristocracy. Small town and village-dwellers to whom the Persian language was alien preferred the music of the ashigs (traveling bards singing in a vernacular language, i.e. Azeri). Classical khanandas followed a specific dress code which included a chokha, an arkhalig, an astrakhan <b>cap</b> (papag), <b>rings</b> and a belt decorated with gold.
