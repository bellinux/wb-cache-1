40|$|A {{relation}} on a hypergraph is a binary {{relation on}} the set consisting of all the nodes and the edges, and which satisfies a constraint involving the incidence structure of the hypergraph. These relations correspond to join preserving mappings on the lattice of sub-hypergraphs. This paper introduces a generalization of a relation algebra in which the Boolean algebra part {{is replaced by a}} Heyting algebra that supports an order-reversing involution. A general construction for these symmetric Heyting relation algebras is given which includes as a special case the algebra of relations on a hypergraph. A particular feature of symmetric Heyting relation algebras is that instead of an involutory converse operation they possess both a left <b>converse</b> and a <b>right</b> <b>converse</b> which form an adjoint pair of operations. Properties of the converses are established and used to derive a generalization of the well-known connection between converse, complement, erosion and dilation in mathematical morphology. This provides part of the foundation necessary to develop mathematical morphology on hypergraphs based on relations on hypergraphs...|$|R

In 1938, after the PNC fell in disfavor with the monarch, Ion Sân-Giorgiu rallied with the latter's National Renaissance Front, becoming its official journalist. Goga's dismissal caught Ion Sân-Giorgiu on a theatrical tour of Germany. Sebastian, who <b>conversed</b> with him <b>right</b> after, mentions him being [...] "unrecognizable", and records his claims that the PNC was responsible for a series of mistakes, and notes that Sân-Giorgiu took no apparent displeasure in talking to a Jew, being [...] "friendly and communicative". Also according to Sebastian, Sân-Giorgiu claimed to have registered major successes in Germany, having stated: [...] "Not even Ibsen had such a triumph; not one unfavorable review." ...|$|R

An oval engraving depicts African Americans with stereotypical features in a plantation setting, with musicians playing fiddle and banjo at the left, two men <b>conversing</b> at the <b>right</b> (watched by a dog), and a group of "slaves" returning from the fields in the distance. The musical programme consists of "Part 1, Salon d'Ethiope": "La Perichole" (Orchestra), "Stars of the Midnight" (W. Ball), "Rock and Roll me" (S. Keenan), "Little Ones Begging"(C. S. Fredericks), "Lucinda Long" (Al. Moynham), "Happy New Year" (T. Bergin), and "Pretty Blue Eyes" (Beaumont Read). Part II lists The Marvellous Girards; Bella, Willie & Percy in their Triple Sand Jig; and Keenan's Sketch, Am-u-let!

6000|$|It quite fell in {{with this}} {{intensity}} that one day, on {{returning from a}} walk with the housemaid, Maisie should have found her in the hall, seated on the stool usually occupied by the telegraph-boys who haunted Beale Farange's door and kicked their heels while, in his room, answers to their missives took form {{with the aid of}} smoke-puffs and growls. It had seemed to her on their parting that Mrs. Wix had reached the last limits of the squeeze, but she now felt those limits to be transcended and that the duration of her visitor's hug was a direct reply to Miss Overmore's veto. She understood in a flash how the visit had come to be possible--that Mrs. Wix, watching her chance, must have slipped in under protection of the fact that papa, always tormented in spite of arguments {{with the idea of a}} school, had, for a three days' excursion to Brighton, absolutely insisted on the attendance of her adversary. It was true that when Maisie explained their absence and their important motive Mrs. Wix wore an expression so peculiar that it could only have had its origin in surprise. This contradiction indeed peeped out only to vanish, for at the very moment that, in the spirit of it, she threw herself afresh upon her young friend a hansom crested with neat luggage rattled up to the door and Miss Overmore bounded out. The shock of her encounter with Mrs. Wix was less violent than Maisie had feared on seeing her and didn't at all interfere with the sociable tone in which, under her rival's eyes, she explained to her little charge that she had returned, for a particular reason, a day sooner than she first intended. She had left papa--in such nice lodgings--at Brighton; but he would come back to his dear little home on the morrow. As for Mrs. Wix, papa's companion supplied Maisie in later <b>converse</b> with the <b>right</b> word for the attitude of this personage: Mrs. Wix [...] "stood up" [...] to her in a manner that the child herself felt at the time to be astonishing. This occurred indeed after Miss Overmore had so far raised her interdict as to make a move to the dining-room, where, in the absence of any suggestion of sitting down, it was scarcely more than natural that even poor Mrs. Wix should stand up. Maisie at once enquired if at Brighton, this time, anything had come of the possibility of a school; to which, much to her surprise, Miss Overmore, who had always grandly repudiated it, replied after an instant, but quite as if Mrs. Wix were not there: ...|$|R
