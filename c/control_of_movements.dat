5000|$|Few {{studies of}} complex motor control have {{distinguished}} between sequential and spatial organization, yet expert musical performances demand not only precise sequencing but also spatial organization of movements.

50|$|Related, yet {{distinct}} from {{the issue of how}} the processing of sensory information affects the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>movements</b> and actions is the question of how the perception of the world structures action.

What is perceived and how the subsequent information is used to organize the motor system is a current and ongoing area of research.|$|E

50|$|The {{supplementary}} motor area (SMA) {{is a part of}} the primate {{cerebral cortex}} that contributes to the control of movement. It is located on the midline surface of the hemisphere just in front of (anterior to) the primary motor cortex leg representation. In monkeys the SMA contains a rough map of the body. In humans the body map is not apparent. Neurons in the SMA project directly to the spinal cord and may play a role in the direct control of movement. Possible functions attributed to the SMA include the postural stabilization of the body, the coordination of both sides of the body such as during bimanual action, the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>movements</b> that are internally generated rather than triggered by sensory events, and the control of sequences of movements.

40|$|Why do {{movements}} take {{a characteristic}} amount of time, {{and why do}} diseases that affect the reward system alter <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>movements?</b> Suppose {{that the purpose of}} any movement is to position our body in a more rewarding state. People and other animals discount future reward as a hyperbolic function of time. Here, we show that across populations of people and monkeys there is a correlation between discounting of reward and <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>movements.</b> We consider saccadic eye movements and hypothesize that duration of a movement is equivalent to a delay of reward. The hyperbolic cost of this delay not only accounts for kinematics of saccades in adults, it also accounts for the faster saccades of children, who temporally discount reward more steeply. Our theory explains why saccade velocities increase when reward is elevated, and why disorders in the encoding of reward, for example in Parkinson’s disease and schizophrenia, produce changes in saccade. We show that delay of reward elevates the cost of saccades, reducing velocities. Finally, we consider coordinated movements that include motion of eyes and head and find that their kinematics is also consistent with a hyperbolic, reward-dependent cost of time. Therefore, each voluntary movement carries a cost because its duration delays acquisition of reward. The cost depends on the value that the brain assigns to stimuli, and the rate at which it discounts this value in time. The motor commands that move our eyes reflect this cost of time...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Neural <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> is {{typically}} studied in constrained environments {{where there is}} a reduced set of possible behaviors. This constraint may unintentionally limit the applicability of findings to the generalized case of unconstrained behavior. We hypothesize that examining the unconstrained state across multiple behavioral contexts will lead to new insights into the neural <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> and help advance the design of neural prosthetic decode algorithms. However, to pursue electrophysiological studies in such a manner requires a more flexible framework for experimentation. We propose that head-mounted neural recording systems with wireless data transmission, combined with markerless computer-vision based motion tracking, will enable new, less constrained experiments. As a proof-of-concept, we recorded and wirelessly transmitted broadband neural data from 32 electrodes in premotor cortex while acquiring single-camera video of a rhesus macaque walking on a treadmill. We demonstrate the ability to extract behavioral kinematics using an automated computer vision algorithm without use of markers and to predict kinematics from the neural data. Together these advances suggest that a new class of “freely moving monkey ” experiments should be possible and should help broaden our understanding <b>of</b> the neural <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement.</b> I...|$|R

40|$|Neural {{coupling}} {{between the}} central nervous system and the periphery is essential for the neural <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement.</b> Corticomuscular coherence is a popular linear technique to assess synchronised oscillatory activity in the sensorimotor system. This oscillatory coupling originates from ascending somatosensory feedback and descending motor commands. However, corticomuscular coherence cannot separate this bidirectionality. Furthermore, the sensorimotor system is nonlinear, resulting in cross-frequency coupling. Cross-frequency oscillations cannot be assessed nor exploited by linear measures. Here, we emphasise the need of novel coupling measures, which provide directionality and acknowledge nonlinearity, to unveil neural coupling in the sensorimotor system.
