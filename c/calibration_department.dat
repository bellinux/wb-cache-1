40|$|Latvian National Metrology Centre is {{a public}} {{organization}} with legal liability. Its main task is to ensure uniformity of measurement {{throughout the country and}} provide metrological services to persons and organizations. The Latvian law currently in force is “Law of traceability”. The objective of the law is to defend people’s life, health and environment. In Latvia, there is highest metrological institute: The Latvian National Metrology Centre, State agency. Main tasks of State Agency are to maintain uniformity and traceability of physical units, verification and calibration of measuring instruments and standards (weights etc.). Department of mass measurement of State Agency is a holder of national mass standards. These are 1 kg mass standard in stainless steel and two sets of mass standards (from 1 mg to 500 g). Laboratory performs periodic calibration and statistical analysis of mass standards. The Department of mass measurement ensures traceability between national mass standards (with values derived from the International Prototype of the kilogram) and weights of class E 1 and lower. Once in two years national mass standards are carried to DFM (Dansk Fundamental Metrologi, Denmark) or other laboratory for <b>calibration.</b> <b>Department</b> of mass measurement of State Agency has probably the best mass measurement equipment in Latvia, such as “Sartorius” comparator (high-precision mass measurement instrument). ScalesNet 32 is the software used for data acquisition and analysis. Computer running ScalesNet 32 is connected to both comparator and climate control system of the lab. This equipment allows LNMC to perform calibration of E 1 class weights (most accurate ones). Department of mass measurement of State Agency does participate in various international interlaboratory comparisons schemes: “ 839 EUROMET”, “EUROMET 786 ”, “LNMC (Latvia) -METROSERT (Estonia) - MIKES (Finland) ”, “ 832 EUROMET” and others. At present, the laboratory is planning interlaboratory comparison of mass measurement capability between various Latvian laboratories. Department of mass measurement will be the pilot laboratory of the comparison. Comparisons like this have never been carried out before. This comparison will be first such project in Latvia. We have to adapt existing methods and procedures for our needs or develop new ones. Major complication is that there is strong competition between some of participants. However, small size of Latvia makes transfer of standards less complex and expensive task. Interlaboratory comparisons allow laboratories to validate measurement capability, identify and correct measurement errors, assess technical proficiency and calibration procedures, verify adequacy of laboratory environment, provide evidence of measurement traceability and demonstrate measurement comparability between laboratories...|$|E

40|$|Liquid crystal {{thermography}} (LCT) {{has been}} widely used for the determination of surface heat transfer distribution. However, this technique is sensitive to illumination and viewing angle and therefore limited to surfaces with only slight curvature. A liquid crystal calibration technique using true-colour image processing system has now been developed to alleviate the effect of viewing angle on oblique/curved surfaces. Application of the calibration and transient liquid crystal thermographic techniques and uncertainty analysis to a heated air slot jet impinging on a semi-cylindrical convex surface has been demonstrated. It is shown that the local heat transfer coefficient may be overestimated by up to 39. 1 % at a viewing angle of 69 ° from the normal under test conditions. However, the overall uncertainty in heat transfer coefficient can be significantly reduced from the maximum value of 36. 3 % to within 11. 1 % by using the implemented viewing <b>calibration</b> technique. <b>Department</b> of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Current {{methods for}} the {{detection}} and quantitation of airborne asbestos are either tedious, time consuming, subjective, or too expensive for routine analysis. A FT-IR spectroscopic method for the identification and quantitation of airborne asbestos samples provides a relatively inexpensive, fast, and non-subjective alternative for routine analysis. Three methods are investigated for {{the separation of the}} asbestos fibers from the matrix of the collection filter, (a mixed cellulose ester) for infrared analysis: spectral subtraction, chemical digestion, and ashing. Problems associated with the handling of asbestos (sample loss and contamination), and band anomalies encountered during spectral subtractions are discussed. Calibration curves are presented using the asbestos Si-O absorptions to quantitate the amount of asbestos. The spectral subtraction method yields linear calibration curves down to 0. 3 % asbestos by weight (6 mg) for tremolite asbestos. Tremolite and amosite asbestos calibration curves are linear down to 8 µg and 3 µg asbestos respectively using the ashing method. The spectral subtraction method and the ashing method are applied to NIOSH prepared PAT samples previously analyzed by phase contrast microscopy. The spectra are analyzed for asbestos by band identity, and once identified, quantitated from the appropriate <b>calibration</b> curve. <b>Department</b> of ChemistryThesis (M. S. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNon-contact 3 D {{digitizing}} scanners {{based in}} structured light projection are increasingly more accurate, fastest and affordable. The {{purpose of this}} work {{was to determine the}} quality, accuracy and traceability of the data provided by new LED technology scanner of structured light Comet L 3 D (Steinbichler) acquired by the <b>Department.</b> <b>Calibration</b> of the equipment and accuracy analysis was carried out with a calibration plate and a number of gauge blocks of different sizes. The accuracy range of the scanner has been established through multiple digitizations showing the dependence on influential factors such as the characteristics of the object and scanning procedure. Although many factors influence, accuracies announced by manufacturer have been achieved under optimal conditions and it has been noted that the quality of the point clouds (density, noise, dispersion of points) provided by Comet L 3 D system is higher than that obtained with laser technology devices...|$|R
40|$|Prior to April 2007, {{acceptance}} and performance {{testing of the}} various Special Nuclear Material (SNM) monitoring devices at the Nevada Test Site (NTS) was performed by the Radiological Health Instrumentation <b>department.</b> <b>Calibration</b> and performance testing on the PM- 700 personnel portal monitor was performed, {{but there was no}} test program for the VM- 250 vehicle portal monitor.

5000|$|Eimert invited Stockhausen {{to become}} his {{assistant}} at the Cologne studio, and he arrived in March 1953 [...] In Paris, Stockhausen had already acquired some experience with various sound and tape editing processes. From this he knew that pitches, durations, and amplitudes could in fact be determined very accurately, but timbre eluded serial organisation. Soon after his arrival, Stockhausen came to regard the Monochord and Melochord (which had been purchased {{on the recommendation of}} Meyer-Eppler) as useless for the production of music that was to be organised in all its aspects, especially timbre. He turned to Fritz Enkel, the head of the <b>calibration</b> and testing <b>department,</b> and asked for a sine-wave generator or a beat-frequency oscillator capable of producing sine waves, from which Stockhausen intended to build sound spectra. Enkel was shocked, since the two recently acquired keyboard instruments, which Stockhausen was now telling him were of no use at all, had cost 120,000 Marks. Besides, Enkel told him, “It will never work!” Stockhausen responded, [...] "Maybe you're right, but I want to try it all the same" [...]|$|R
