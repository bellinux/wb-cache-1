A variety of species remain {{important}} sources of edible oil, thatch, edible seeds and fibre. The leaves of Attalea butyracea and A.maripa are used extensively for thatching. Several species are oil palms, with A.speciosa among the most important economically. Products extracted from A.speciosa were reported to support over 300,000 households in the Brazilian state of Maranhão in 2005, and in 1985 it was estimated to support over 450,000 households throughout the Brazil. Piassava fibres, extracted from the leaf bases of A.funifera, are commercially important, and generated about US$20 million in annual income to Brazilian farmers in 1996.|$|E

The remains of <b>carbonised</b> seeds thought to belong to A.horrida have been found in archaeological sites in Colombia dating back to about 2800 BP; seeds of this species are still {{consumed}} and are traded in local markets. Aiphanes horrida is also widely planted as an ornamental, as is A.minima. [...] The fruit or seeds of A.deltoidea, [...] A.eggersii, A.linearis and A.minima are all consumed locally.

30|$|Recently, a {{new form}} of {{intumescent}} fire retardant coatings for wood-based materials was introduced (Chou et al. 2009). The authors investigated the usefulness of an artificial graphite powder and a sericrite (Al 4 (OH) 4 (KAl-Si 3 O 10) 2), and a mixture of the two on plywood. The intumescent fire retardant coating contained 19.8 % of the fire retardant, 15 % of the dehydration agent, 18 % of the foaming agent, 7.2 % of the resin binder and 40 % of the solvent, was prepared and applied to the surface of plywood.

"In June (1928) the Franco British Co. {{acquired}} the Argyll colliery {{and at a}} Campbeltown Town Council meeting on 13th August, Mr. Maisel, a director, said that gas could be got from a proposed coal distillation plant and bought by the town.

40|$|ABSTRACT Six {{hundred and}} ten coke oven {{personnel}} were studied retrospectively {{over a period}} of 11 years (1954 - 65). During this time 82 died, 88 retired and 80 left, but all were traced. The Standard-ised Mortality Ratios (SMRs) have been calculated for four principal causes which have then been further analysed into 30 subgroups. The work was limited because the population was small and the records not detailed enough to analyse the mortality rates according to environmental exposures. Differences between SMRs obtained at the two works were quite marked (73 and 98) and the overall SMR of 85 % was better than expected. The observed number of deaths from respiratory disease, malignant neoplasms and all other causes excluding cardiovascular, was very near that expected, but the numbers of deaths from cardiovascular disease and in particular arteriosclerotic disease, showed a significant deficit.

40|$|Background: The holotype of the {{theropod}} non-avian dinosaur Microraptor gui {{from the}} Early Cretaceous of China shows extensive preservation of feathers in a halo {{around the body}} and with flight feathers associated with both the fore and hindlimbs. It has been questioned {{as to whether or}} not the feathers did extend into the halo to reach the body, or had disassociated and moved before preservation. This taxon has important implications for the origin of flight in birds and the possibility of a four-winged gliding phase. Methodology/Principal Findings: Examination of the specimen under ultraviolet light reveals that these feathers actually reach the body of the animal and were not disassociated from the bones. Instead they may have been chemically altered by the body tissues of the animal meaning that they did not <b>carbonise</b> close into the animal or more likely were covered by other decaying tissue, though evidence of their presence remains.

40|$|Protein-based animal fibres of {{commercial}} importance are frequently exposed to elevated temperatures during processing treatments. Hydrothermal processes cause protein deterioration, impacting negatively {{on the value}} or condition of these materials. This {{study was designed to}} investigate hydrothermal damage in wool proteins at the molecular level. The effect of hydrothermal damage on Type I and II intermediate filament proteins (keratins) extracted from wool was characterised using advanced quantitative techniques based on isobaric iTRAQ labelling and mass spectrometry. Many native peptides were observed to be degraded and modified. Amongst these, twenty keratin peptides were observed to consistently degrade during hydrothermal exposure. These peptides acted as molecular markers of damage – specific indicators of the extent of heat-induced protein damage. This technology will be of value in assessing the severity of damage imparted after high temperature exposure of protein-based animal fibres such as wool and cashmere during processes such as dyeing and <b>carbonising,</b> or even after high temperature human hair treatments. The identification of molecular damage markers identified within wool and other materials provides a new route to sensitive and specific evaluation of the effects of protein deterioration. It is anticipated that the utilisation of such markers will facilitate the development of targeted approaches to minimising processing damage to high-value fibres and protein-based biomaterials...|$|R
30|$|RFA {{was first}} {{reported}} in liver tumours in the 1990 s [18], {{and is the}} most widely used and most investigated method for the treatment of small renal masses [17, 19]. RFA uses an alternating current (460 – 500  kHz) delivered through the lesion with the use of straight or expandable applicators known as electrodes. RFA requires the use of grounding pads on the skin to allow for a closed electrical circuit between the body and the RFA generator. Circulation of the alternating current causes high-frequency agitation of the ionic molecules contained within the tissues and thereby frictional heat is produced. Temperatures between 60  °C and 100  °C produce immediate cell death by protein denaturation and coagulative tumour necrosis. However, in temperatures above 100  °C, water vaporises and tissue adjacent to the electrode may <b>carbonise,</b> this way degrading the electrical conductance properties and increasing tissue impedance; the latter may result in a suboptimal treatment effect; electrodes with a circulating cooling saline chamber have been developed to limit this phenomenon. The efficacy of RFA is also limited by adjacent high-flow vascular structures, producing the well-known energy-sink or heat-sink effect; this occurs more frequently in the liver where major vascular structures may be located adjacent to the ablated areas, whereas in the kidney it may be encountered only for the very central tumours.|$|R
