40|$|One {{constraint}} {{facing the}} pig industry is that {{ad libitum feeding}} can often result in high levels of body fat and technologies which can reduce the ratio of lean to fat deposition in the pig are continually being explored. <b>Conjugated</b> <b>linoleic</b> <b>acids</b> {{have been shown to}} decrease body fat content in pigs. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether dietary <b>conjugated</b> <b>linoleic</b> <b>acids</b> supplementation has any effect on meat quality and carcass characteristics in finisher pigs. Sixty female crossbred (Large White × Landrace) pigs (average initial weight 56. 6 ± 1. 9 kg and average initial P 2 backfat 11. 4 ± 1. 3 mm) were used in the present study. Pigs were individually housed and randomly allocated to 1 of 6 dietary treatments: 0, 0. 125, 0. 25, 0. 50, 0. 75 or 1. 0 % (w/w) of <b>conjugated</b> <b>linoleic</b> acids- 55. The wheat-based diets were formulated to contain 14. 3 MJ DE and 9. 3 g available lysine per kg and were fed ad libitum for 8 weeks. Pigs were slaughtered and meat quality was determined on the longissimus thoracis using standard techniques. Dietary <b>conjugated</b> <b>linoleic</b> <b>acids</b> reduced subcutaneous back fat in a linear manner with effects being most pronounced in the middle back fat layer. There was also a linear (P < 0. 001) decrease in intramuscular fat with increasing dietary <b>conjugated</b> <b>linoleic</b> <b>acids</b> supplementation. However, there was no effect of <b>conjugated</b> <b>linoleic</b> <b>acids</b> on subjective measures of marbling of the loin. Also, loin muscle ultimate pH (P = 0. 94), lightness values (P = 0. 46) subjective colour scores (P = 0. 79), cooking loss (P = 0. 71), drip loss (P = 0. 40), shear force (P = 0. 61) and subjective measures of wetness/firmness (P = 0. 19) were unaffected. Dietary <b>conjugated</b> <b>linoleic</b> <b>acids</b> did not alter oxidation, as measured by the level of TBARs at day 1 post-slaughter (P = 0. 38) or after 9 days of simulated retail display (P = 0. 35).

40|$|<b>Conjugated</b> <b>linoleic</b> <b>acids</b> (CLA) {{belong to}} the family of {{recently}} discovered anti-cancer factors found in milk fat. In order to exert a significant protection against the development of cancer, intake of CLA should be increased, which can be accomplished with the consumption of food products with enhanced CLA level. The increase of CLA content in milk fat can be obtained through feeding by modification of the biological hydrogenation processes in the rumen. The factors which exert an effect on the amount of CLA formed in conjunction with feeding are the amount and composition of the oil supplementation, the stage of the fat in the diet (e. g. free fat addition or fat within seeds), the structure of the fat-carrier, the fiber content and energy level of feed and the feeding regimen. While assembling diets the above factors should be applied in such a manner that paralell with the increase of CLA content of milk fat possible negative effects due to emerged oil consumption e. g. milk fat depression, decrease of the digestibility of nutrients and that of feed intake would be minimized.

2500|$|A {{molecule}} {{of dietary}} fat typically consists of several fatty acids (containing long chains of carbon and hydrogen atoms), bonded to a glycerol. They are typically found as triglycerides (three fatty acids attached to one glycerol backbone). Fats may {{be classified as}} saturated or unsaturated depending on the detailed structure of the fatty acids involved. Saturated fats {{have all of the}} carbon atoms in their fatty acid chains bonded to hydrogen atoms, whereas unsaturated fats have some of these carbon atoms double-bonded, so their molecules have relatively fewer hydrogen atoms than a saturated fatty acid of the same length. Unsaturated fats may be further classified as monounsaturated (one double-bond) or polyunsaturated (many double-bonds). Furthermore, depending on the location of the double-bond in the fatty acid chain, unsaturated fatty acids are classified as omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids. Trans fats are a type of unsaturated fat with trans-isomer bonds; these are rare in nature and in foods from natural sources; they are typically created in an industrial process called (partial) hydrogenation.

40|$|<b>Conjugated</b> <b>linoleic</b> <b>acids</b> (CLA) are a {{group of}} {{molecules}} that has attracted strong interest in medicine because of the important physiological functionalities {{of some of their}} isomers. The discovery of their beneficial properties has led to an escalating interest on the production of commercial CLA preparations, which is mostly carried out by chemical synthesis. Consequently, there has been an increasing on the demand of suited techniques to analyze CLA. This thesis evaluates the potential of Fourier transform Raman spectroscopy (FT-Raman) for the determination of <b>conjugated</b> <b>linoleic</b> <b>acids</b> in samples containing complex blends of positional and geometrical CLA isomers. To take into account the spectral interferences between CLA isomers and further test the capabilities of FT-Raman spectroscopy to distinguish them, samples of I 2 -photoisomerized <b>linoleic</b> <b>acid</b> were analyzed. This photochemical method of synthesis was selected because of its capacity of producing samples with a complex CLA isomeric profile but without a dominant CLA isomer. Our results show that the information contained in the band corresponding to the symmetric stretching vibration of the C=C groups can be reliably used for the determination of total CLA by FT-Raman spectroscopy. In addition, other experiments demonstrate that FT-Raman spectroscopy coupled with PLS regression analysis is a reliable technique to monitor a single isomer in blends containing a dominant CLA isomer. To our knowledge, the present study is the first successful attempt to determine the total CLA content of oils and fats by Raman spectroscopy. (AGRO 3) [...] UCL, 201...|$|R

Rumen ciliate {{protozoa}} contain {{high concentrations}} of <b>conjugated</b> <b>linoleic</b> <b>acids</b> and vaccenic acid, yet do not hydrogenate <b>linoleic</b> <b>acid</b> or desaturate stearic acid. British Journal of Nutrition, 96 (4), 697 - 704. <b>Conjugated</b> <b>linoleic</b> <b>acids</b> (CLA) {{have been shown to}} improve human health. They are derived from the microbial conversion of dietary <b>linoleic</b> <b>acid</b> (cis- 9,cis- 12 - 18 : 2 (LA)) in the rumen. An investigation was undertaken to determine the role of ruminal ciliate protozoa v. bacteria in the formation of CLA and its precursor in animal tissues, vaccenic acid (trans- 11 - 18 : 1 (VA)). Mixed protozoa from the sheep rumen contained at least two to three times more unsaturated fatty acids, including CLA and VA, than bacteria. Different species had different composition, with larger fibrolytic species such as Epidinium ecaudatum caudatum containing more than ten times more CLA and VA than some small species, including Entodinium nanellum. In incubations with ruminal microbial fractions (bacterial fraction (BAC), protozoal fraction (PRO)), LA metabolism was very similar in strained ruminal fluid (SRF) and in the BAC, while the PRO had LA-metabolising activity an order of magnitude lower. Using PCR-based methods, no genes homologous to fatty acid desaturase genes were found in cDNA libraries from ruminal protozoa. The absence of an alternative route of VA/CLA formation via desaturation of stearate was confirmed by incubations of SRF, BAC or PRO with [C- 14] stearate. Thus, although protozoa are rich in CLA and VA, they appear to lack the ability to form these two fatty acids from LA or stearate. The most likely explanation is that protozoa preferentially incorporate CLA and VA formed by bacteria. The implication of the present findings is that the flow of unsaturated fatty acids, including CLA and VA, from the rumen could depend on the flow of protozoa rather than bacteria.
