25|$|A summability method M is regular if it {{agrees with}} the actual limit on all <b>convergent</b> <b>series.</b> Such a result is called an Abelian theorem for M, from the prototypical Abel's theorem. More interesting, and in general more subtle, are partial {{converse}} results, called tauberian theorems, from a prototype proved by Alfred Tauber. Here partial converse means that if M sums the series Σ, and some side-condition holds, then Σ was convergent in the first place; without any side-condition such a result would say that M only summed <b>convergent</b> <b>series</b> (making it useless as a summation method for divergent series).|$|E

25|$|Remark 2. Due to {{absolute}} convergence, {{expected value}} {{does not depend}} on the order in which the outcomes are presented. By contrast, a conditionally <b>convergent</b> <b>series</b> can be made to converge or diverge arbitrarily, via the Riemann rearrangement theorem.|$|E

25|$|If {{a series}} is {{convergent}} but not absolutely convergent, {{it is called}} conditionally convergent. An example of a conditionally <b>convergent</b> <b>series</b> is the alternating harmonic series. Many standard tests for divergence and convergence, most notably including the ratio test and the root test, demonstrate absolute convergence. This is because a power series is absolutely convergent on the interior of its disk of convergence.|$|E

25|$|The {{function}} {{giving the}} sum of a <b>convergent</b> <b>series</b> is linear, and it follows from the Hahn–Banach theorem {{that it may be}} extended to a summation method summing any series with bounded partial sums. This fact is not very useful in practice, since there are many such extensions, inconsistent with each other, and also since proving such operators exist requires invoking the axiom of choice or its equivalents, such as Zorn's lemma. They are therefore nonconstructive.|$|E
25|$|Before the 19th century, {{divergent}} series were widely used by Leonhard Euler and others, but often led to confusing and contradictory results. A major problem was Euler's idea that any {{divergent series}} {{should have a}} natural sum, without first defining {{what is meant by}} the sum of a divergent series. Augustin-Louis Cauchy eventually gave a rigorous definition of the sum of a (<b>convergent)</b> <b>series,</b> and for some time after this, divergent series were mostly excluded from mathematics. They reappeared in 1886 with Henri Poincaré's work on asymptotic series. In 1890, Ernesto Cesàro realized that one could give a rigorous definition of the sum of some divergent series, and defined Cesàro summation. (This was not the first use of Cesàro summation, which was used implicitly by Ferdinand Georg Frobenius in 1880; Cesàro's key contribution was not the discovery of this method, but his idea that one should give an explicit definition of the sum of a divergent series.) In the years after Cesàro's paper, several other mathematicians gave other definitions of the sum of a divergent series, although these are not always compatible: different definitions can give different answers for the sum of the same divergent series; so, when talking about the sum of a divergent series, it is necessary to specify which summation method one is using.|$|E

500|$|In 1918 Hardy and Ramanujan {{studied the}} {{partition}} function [...] extensively. They gave a non-convergent asymptotic series that permits exact computation {{of the number}} of partitions of an integer. Hans Rademacher, in 1937, was able to refine their formula to find an exact <b>convergent</b> <b>series</b> solution to this problem. Ramanujan and Hardy's work in this area gave rise to a powerful new method for finding asymptotic formulae called the circle method.|$|E
