50|$|The EUROP {{grid method}} of carcass {{classification}} was implemented in 1981. European Economic Community Regulations (EEC) No. 1208/81 and No. 2930/81 were enacted to facilitate <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> a community scale for <b>the</b> classification <b>of</b> <b>carcases</b> of {{adult bovine animals}}. This was to ensure <b>the</b> uniform classification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carcases</b> <b>of</b> adult bovine animals in the EEC and make <b>the</b> definitions <b>of</b> conformation classes and fat classes more precise. The need arose for a common grading scale when member states <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EEC began operating in the common beef market in 1968 (EEC) No. 805/68 and price reporting to the EC became mandatory.|$|R

40|$|CystiCerCus bovis is <b>the</b> {{larval stage}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human beef tapeworm, taenia saginata. Cattle {{act as the}} {{intermediate}} host for the parasite.

50|$|In the UK, the Meat and Livestock Commission (MLC Services Ltd) is {{responsible}} for <b>the</b> classification <b>of</b> over 80% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cattle slaughtered in Britain. The EUROP grid consists of a 5-point scale in which each conformation and fat class is subdivided into low medium and high classes resulting in 15 classes. In the UK, the fat classes range from 1-5 with classes 4 and 5 having a high and low sub-class which results in a seven-point scale for fatness (figure 1). It is argued by the MLC that this subdivision allows a more precise description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carcase.</b>|$|R

40|$|Chlamydiae are obligate {{intracellular}} {{bacteria that}} infect {{a broad range}} of host species, including sheep. Two species of Chlamydia infect sheep, C. abortus, which is a major cause of abortion in both sheep and goats, and C. pecorum, which causes pneumonia, arthritis/polyarthritis, encephalomyelitis, conjunctivitis, enteritis, abortion and metritis and infertility in domestic ruminants and pigs. <b>The</b> prevalence <b>of</b> faecal shedding of C. pecorum is relatively common amongst lambs in Australia. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work presented here was to use qPCR to determine <b>the</b> prevalence <b>of</b> C. pecorum in synovial samples obtained from abnormal joints trimmed from lamb carcases at one abattoir in southern Australia. The study included 53, 131 carcases screened for arthritis, of which 369 had at least one abnormal joint trimmed. One hundred and forty eight trimmed joints were undamaged and suitable for PCR testing. <b>The</b> prevalence <b>of</b> C. pecorum in synovial tissue collected from the abnormal joints was 6. 1 % and the bacterial concentration ranged from 6 × 103 to 7. 6 × 105 /g of synovial tissue. Five <b>of</b> <b>the</b> positive joint samples were from carcases that had one joint trimmed for arthritis and four were from carcases from which two joints had been trimmed. None <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carcases</b> from which <b>the</b> positive joint samples originated were condemned. The average arthritis trim weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carcases</b> from which synovial tissue tested positive for C. pecorum was 1. 112 kg (95 % confidence interval 0. 637 - 1. 586 kg) and this did not differ from <b>the</b> <b>carcases</b> from which synovial tissue was not positive for C. pecorum.
