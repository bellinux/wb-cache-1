500|$|Pure {{platinum}} is a lustrous, ductile, and malleable, silver-white metal. Platinum is more ductile than gold, silver or copper, thus {{being the}} most ductile of pure metals, but it is less malleable than gold. The metal has excellent resistance to corrosion, is stable at high temperatures and has stable electrical properties. Platinum reacts with oxygen slowly at very high temperatures. It reacts vigorously with fluorine at [...] to form platinum tetrafluoride. It is also attacked by chlorine, bromine, iodine, and sulfur. Platinum is insoluble in hydrochloric and nitric acid, but dissolves in hot aqua regia(nitric acid hydrochloride), to form <b>chloroplatinic</b> <b>acid,</b> H2PtCl6.|$|E
500|$|Rubidium {{is a minor}} {{component}} in lepidolite. Kirchhoff and Bunsen processed 150kg of a lepidolite containing only 0.24% rubidium oxide (Rb2O). Both potassium and rubidium form insoluble salts with <b>chloroplatinic</b> <b>acid,</b> but those salts show a slight difference in solubility in hot water. Therefore, the less-soluble rubidium hexachloroplatinate (Rb2PtCl6) could be obtained by fractional crystallization. After reduction of the hexachloroplatinate with hydrogen, the process yielded 0.51grams of rubidium chloride for further studies. Bunsen and Kirchhoff began their first large-scale isolation of caesium and rubidium compounds with [...] of mineral water, which yielded 7.3grams of caesium chloride and 9.2grams of rubidium chloride.

50|$|An ecologically-friendly {{synthesis}} of platinum nanoparticles from <b>chloroplatinic</b> <b>acid</b> was achieved {{through the use}} of a leaf extract of Diospyros kaki as a reducing agent. Nanoparticles synthesized as such were spherical with an average diameter ranging from 2-12 nm depending on reaction temperature and concentration of leaf extract used. Spectroscopic analysis suggests that this reaction is not enzyme-mediated and proceeds instead through plant-derived reductive small molecules. Another eco-friendly synthesis from <b>chloroplatinic</b> <b>acid</b> was reported using leaf extract from Ocimum sanctum and tulsi as reducing agents. Spectroscopic analysis suggested that ascorbic acid, gallic acid, various terpenes, and certain amino acids were active in the reduction. Particles synthesized as such were shown through scanning electron microscopy to consist in aggregates with irregular shape.

50|$|Platinum {{nanoparticles}} {{of controlled}} {{shape and size}} have also been accessed through varying the ratio of polymer capping agent concentration to precursor concentration. Reductive colloidal syntheses as such have yielded tetrahedral, cubic, irregular-prismatic, icosahedral, and cubo-octahedral nanoparticles, whose dispersity is also dependent on the concentration ratio of capping agent to precursor, and which may be applicable to catalysis. The precise mechanism of shape-controlled colloidal synthesis is not yet known; however, {{it is known that}} the relative growth rate of crystal facets within the growing nanostructure determines its final shape. Polyol syntheses of platinum nanoparticles, in which <b>chloroplatinic</b> <b>acid</b> is reduced to PtCl42− and Pt0 by ethylene glycol, have also been a means to shape-controlled fabrication. Addition of varying amounts of sodium nitrate to these reactions was shown to yield tetrahedra and octahedra at high concentration ratios of sodium nitrate to <b>chloroplatinic</b> <b>acid.</b> Spectroscopic studies suggest that nitrate is reduced to nitrite by PtCl42− early in this reaction, and that the nitrite may then coordinate both Pt(II) and Pt(IV), greatly slowing the polyol reduction and altering the growth rates of distinct crystal facets within the nanoparticles, ultimately yielding morphological differentiation.|$|E
