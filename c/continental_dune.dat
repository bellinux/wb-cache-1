50|$|The park boasts unique {{residual}} Lake Plazė (Plocis), <b>continental</b> <b>dunes,</b> an 18-20 m high bluff on the Baltic Sea, glacial boulder {{fields on}} the coast, and Olando kepurė Hill, which is {{and has been}} a navigational guide for sailors and fishermen. It also has flora and fauna specific to the fields and forests of the dunes and the coastal plains. Water birds nest and make migratory stopovers in the Baltic Sea, Lake Kalotė, and Lake Plazė.|$|R
5000|$|In South America, {{the word}} médanos refers to <b>continental</b> <b>dunes</b> whereas dunas refers to dunes of coastal origin. Médanos may be vegetated or unvegetated. For example, the médanos of La Pampa Province in Argentina are mostly vegetated dunes with {{occasional}} blowouts. On the other hand, the dunes of Médanos de Coro National Park in Venezuela are mostly unvegetated. An early description of unvegetated médanos in Peru {{is provided by}} the Swiss naturalist and explorer Johann Jakob von Tschudi (1847): ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. — In the B 2 il. - B 4 {{horizon of}} a podzol on the <b>continental</b> <b>dunes</b> of Linkhout a small {{concentration}} of prehistoric artifacts was found. Nearly {{the totality of}} these artifacts are made from Wom- mersom quartzite. The most caracteristic feature of this industry consists in the numerous perforators. This industry is tentatively ascribed to an old Mesolithic. Vermeersch P. -M., Carolus J. Un site mésolithique à Linkhout-Kampbergen (Limbourg belge).

50|$|Her {{research}} {{resided around}} the fungal flora of the <b>continental</b> sand <b>dune</b> systems in Hungary. She performed extensive field work and collecting of fungi in several sites with moving sand dunes, dry sandy grasslands, wet and marshy interdune habitats and dry steppe forests in Hungary. Many of her research sites {{belonged to the}} Kiskunság National Park or the Hortobágy National Park and the knowledge gathered still forms {{the basis of our}} understanding of the European <b>continental</b> sand <b>dune</b> mycoflora. She made extensive comparisons with coastal, halophilic sand dunes and was always delighted by the high species overlap between these habitats despite great geography distances. She has reported the occurrence in Hungary many of the species described from coastal sand dunes in France and Spain, most of which were new for the Hungarian mycoflora.|$|R
40|$|The inland dunes of {{the young}} moraine area (=area {{formerly}} covered by the Weichselian ice cap) of the former GDR, south of the Pomeranian terminal moraine, have never {{been the subject of}} an overall treatment, that means, a review of existing publications is missing. In this article a review of literature from 1945 onwards is presented, with emphasis on the dating of the inland dunes {{due to a lack of}} knowledge on this subject. Most authors accept a periglacial genesis of the majority of the inland dunes ("Altdünen"). During the Holocene a transformation of a part of those Late Glacial <b>continental</b> <b>dunes</b> took place ("Jungdünen mit Altdünenkern"), and also new forms developed ("Jungdünen"). The grain-size distribution, forms and geographical distribution of the inland dunes in the study area are relatively well described by Seeler (1962), Noack (1965) and others. The inland dunes were mainly formed by westerly winds. They can reach heights from 15 up to 25 m. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{potential}} for aeolian abrasion of natural dune sands to produce fine dust particles. Particular attention is given to how the particle size, sorting, colour, shape {{and the presence of}} iron oxide coatings and clay skins affect the rate of dust production. Natural dune sand samples were obtained from the crests of active <b>continental</b> <b>dunes</b> from the Simpson Desert and the Channel Country and abraded for 72 hours using a large glass 'test-tube' chamber. The chipping, spalling and breakage of sand grains and the removal of iron oxide coatings and clay skins from grain surfaces produced between 0. 41 - 0. 98 % fine particles. Statistical analysis identified that the degree of sorting and grain roundness of a sand sample are the major influences on the dust production rate. Well-sorted, sub-rounded sand samples yielded less dust than poorly sorted angular sand grains. Comparison with previous studies of aeolian abrasion of crushed quartz sands, these natural dune sands produced very low quantities of fine material, but the widespread geographical distribution of desert dune fields makes them potentially a significant source of dust-sized particles on a global scale...|$|R
40|$|The nanuzae {{group of}} lizards {{includes}} three species, Tropidurus nanuzae, T. divaricatus and T. amathites. The first species is found along Serra do Espinhaço, in eastern Brazil, {{and the other}} two in the northern region of the Brazilian State of Bahia, in <b>continental</b> <b>dunes</b> on both margins of the São Francisco River. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) of the mtDNA in these species were detected in 53 restriction sites. Site and fragment length polymorphisms were characterized, and cases of heteroplasmy involving length variation were observed. In T. divaricatus, these variations involved changes of 50 - 200 bp, probably in the control region of the molecule. In T. amathites, variation was apparently due to duplication/deletion of a 400 -bp segment. Fragment length mutation rate varied among the species, being smaller in T. amathites than in T. divaricatus. Relatively low nucleotide diversity values were detected in these populations, the smallest being found in T. nanuzae. The most polymorphic population was T. divaricatus from Alagoado, followed by that of the same species from Ibiraba, suggesting both probable recovery of mtDNA genetic diversity after putative reductions in population size, and recent population expansion...|$|R
50|$|The {{nature reserve}} {{encompasses}} {{a portion of}} a large area of wetlands, and the landscape is dominated by bogs; however it is also the location of the only system of <b>continental</b> sand <b>dunes</b> in Estonia, overgrown with rare old-growth forest. The area has traditionally been difficult to access and therefore the traces of human influence are very limited. It even served as a refuge for local people during times of war. Oil shale mining in the vicinity, as well as intensified forestry, are today the major threats to the area's unique environment.|$|R

The database comprises information on the site location (including coordinates), dune type, and stratigraphic context, pertinent analytical information (e. g. luminescence procedures), and literature citations to the original data source. This paper discusses the background to the project, the concept {{and structure of the}} chronologic database that forms its core, and gives some examples of the scope of the database and ways in which it can contribute to greater understanding of the spatial and temporal variability in dune development.

50|$|Marine transgression, and {{continental}} wind-blown sand, {{laid down}} the three units of Kaibab, Toroweap, and Coconino. The oceanic sea came from the west, and receded and re-transgressed. The Coconino Sandstone being made of sand <b>dunes,</b> <b>continental,</b> means that near-shore Toroweap deposits, and off-shore Kaibab Limestone, can {{all have the same}} actual ages in different regions where they were deposited, (continental, near-shore, open sea). In Arizona, the Toroweap formation is found in two transgessions eastwards, with easternmost 'strand-lines' locating the shoreline, Toroweap west, and Coconino sand dunes or beach deposits, east.|$|R
40|$|Insect {{herbivory}} is common, but {{the conditions}} under which it reduces the fitness and population size of plants remain poorly understood. We quantified populationlevel impacts of floral herbivory by specialized insects on cobweb thistle (Cirsium occidentale var. occidentale) in a California coastal dune ecosystem, and then compared these demographic effects to those published for Platte thistle (Cirsium canescens) in similarly designed exclusion experiments in the <b>continental</b> sand <b>dune</b> ecosystem in the Great Plains. As a separate test of the strength of the seed-to-seedling linkage, we quantified seedling establishment rates in seed addition plots and compared these results to those obtained in herbivore exclusion experiments. This is the first test of direct vs. indirect methods of evaluating the potential impact of seed loss in plant dynamics. Floral herbivory on cobweb thistle in coastal dunes substantially reduced key components of plant fitness. Reduction of insect feeding within flower heads with insecticide increased mean per capita seed production by 144 – 316...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{contains}} {{an approach to}} systematize {{the study of the}} State of Paraná coastal plains, {{in the southern part of}} Brazil. It contains in general some geographical and geological data, documented by maps, sketches and photographs. In the initial stage the coastal plain represents a marine ingression, caused by faulting. This ingression penetrated the valleys of a not yet determinated geological landscape. Ended the movement of deeping by faulting begins the epirogenic ascension and building of the barriers and beach ridges. An intensive sedimentation caused the lagoons and bays obstruction. This work refers mainly to t 33 he sedimentary formations and the coastal plains is classified in the following way for the study in consideration to the morphology and origin: Marine sedimentation - shore, barrier and beach ridge; Intermediary sedimentation - mangrove swamps, mud and sand banks and mangrovito; <b>Continental</b> sedimentation - <b>dunes</b> and terrestrial alluvion. There are also presented some data about the rocky coast and vegetation...|$|R
