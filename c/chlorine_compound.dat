However, much less is known of mechanisms of defense against halogens such as <b>chlorine</b> <b>compounds.</b> Although chlorine-based oxidants may oxidize {{a number of}} cellular components, sulfhydrl groups are particularly reactive. We have, therefore, assessed the importance of intracellular glutathione in protection of Escherichia coli cells against hydrogen peroxide, hypochlorous acid, and chloramines. Employing a glutathione-deficient E. coli strain (JTG 10) and an otherwise isogenic glutathione-sufficient E. coli strain (AB 1157), we find that glutathione-deficient organisms are approximately twice as sensitive to killing by both hydrogen peroxide and <b>chlorine</b> <b>compounds.</b> However, the mode of protection by glutathione in these two cases appears to differ: exogenous glutathione added to glutathione-deficient E. coli in amounts equal to those which would be present in a similar suspension of the wild-type bacteria fully restored resistance of glutathione-deficient bacteria to chlorine-based oxidants but did not change resistance to hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, in protection against <b>chlorine</b> <b>compounds,</b> oxidized glutathione is almost as effective as reduced glutathione, implying that the tripeptide and/or oxidized thiol undergo further reactions with <b>chlorine</b> <b>compounds.</b> Indeed, in vitro, 1 mol of reduced glutathione will react with approximately 3. 5 to 4. 0 mol of hypochlorous acid.

The chlorine is removed as chloride salt waste. The diisocyanate reacts with a diol to produce polyurethane, which contains no chlorine.
