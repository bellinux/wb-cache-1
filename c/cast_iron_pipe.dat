Though {{the steel industry}} no longer has the same prominence it once held in Birmingham, steel production and processing continue to play a key role in the economy. Steel products manufacturers American <b>Cast</b> <b>Iron</b> <b>Pipe</b> Company (ACIPCO) and McWane are based in the city. Several of the nation's largest steelmakers, including CMC Steel, U.S. Steel, and Nucor, also have a major presence in Birmingham.

Vulcan Materials Company, a major provider of crushed stone, sand, and gravel used in construction, is also based in Birmingham.|$|E
25|$|In 1857 the South Staffordshire Waterworks Co. {{proposed}} {{to fill in}} the pool {{and replace it with a}} public gardens. This was proposed, as it was undesirable to have an open area of water in the middle of a city, which would be used for domestic supply. This proposal was very unpopular among the citizens and the proposal was amended to retain the pool. Instead a <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipe</b> supported by brick piers was laid along the bed of the pool extending under Dam Street and into Stowe Pool. The pipe would carry water from Leamonsley and Trunkfield Brooks through the Museum Gardens in Beacon Park, under Bird Street through Minster Pool and into Stowe Pool. When water was being conveyed in the opposite direction from Stowe Pool to Sandfields Pumping Station the outflow of the brooks would be turned into Minster Pool from where it would outflow into Stowe Pool.|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{corrosion}} is the predominant mechanism for the deterioration of <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipes,</b> leading to the reduction of pipe capacity and ultimate collapse of the pipes. In order to assess the remaining service life of corroded <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipes,</b> it is imperative to understand the mechanisms of corrosion over a long term and to develop models for pipe deterioration. Although many studies have been carried out to determine the corrosion behavior of <b>cast</b> <b>iron,</b> little research has been undertaken to understand how <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> behave over a longer time scale than hours, days, or weeks. The present paper intends to fill the gap regarding the long-term corrosion behaviour of <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> in the absence of historical data. In this paper, a comprehensive experimental program is presented in which the corrosion behaviour of three exservice pipes was thoroughly examined in three simulated service environments. It has been found in the paper that localised corrosion is the primary form of corrosion of <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> water <b>pipes.</b> It has also been found that the microstructure of <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> is a key factor that affects the corrosion behaviour of <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipes.</b> The paper concludes that long-term tests on corrosion behaviour of <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> can help develop models for corrosion-induced deterioration of the pipes for use in predicting the remaining service life of the pipes...|$|R

25|$|The 1853 lease {{gave the}} company {{the right to}} extract water from Red Tarn and Keppelcove Tarn. In the late 1860s both tarns were {{modified}} by building dams. A dam was built in 1868 to increase the capacity of Red Tarn and to regulate the beck supplying water to the Low Mill. In Keppel Cove a natural tarn had formed behind a glacial moraine across {{the floor of the}} valley. To draw on this water in times of low rainfall, a tunnel was made through the moraine and an 18-inch <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipe</b> laid through it to extract water {{from the bottom of the}} tarn. The top of the moraine was flattened and widened, and the work completed in 1871. Catchment of the tarn was increased by diverting two streams into it, include the one out of Brown Cove and at some point a dam was built to create a reservoir in Brown Cove. Its remains can still be seen, though the wall was cut down in 1936 when it was no longer needed.|$|E

40|$|<b>Cast</b> <b>iron</b> was the {{dominant}} material for buried pipes for water networks {{prior to the}} 1970 s in Australia and overseas. At present, many water utilities still have {{a significant amount of}} ageing <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipes.</b> <b>Cast</b> <b>iron</b> is a brittle material and when large diameter <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> (diameters above 300 mm) further deteriorate, the consequences of failure can be substantial. Focusing on the likelihood of failure to assist risk assessment, this paper examines the performance of large-diameter <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> using probabilistic analysis, incorporating uncertainties of governing variables. Finite element analysis is first conducted to study the physical mechanism of buried pipes subjected to complex environmental conditions. The deterioration of <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> due to corrosion is considered on the basis of recent research. The uncertainties of governing variables, such as the physical properties of soil, <b>cast</b> <b>iron,</b> water pressure and corrosion patterns, in pipe failure risk assessment are considered. Using probabilistic physical modelling, the lifetime probability of failure is derived and a time-dependent sensitivity analysis is presented. The results of this probabilistic physical modelling are compared with cohorts of failure data from two Australian water utilities to examine the underlying trends from both physical modelling and statistical analysis...|$|R

2500|$|Edwin Drake, {{a former}} {{conductor}} for the New York and New Haven Railroad, invested $200, his entire savings, into the Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company. Drake became {{more involved in}} the company and traveled to Titusville, Pennsylvania and the Brewer and Watson Farm in December1857. His report prompted Bissell and Eveleth to organize the Seneca Oil Company in Connecticut in March1858 and to place Drake in charge of producing petroleum. Because Drake decided that drilling in the manner of salt wells would yield more petroleum than conventional digging, he hired William A. Smith, a Tarentum blacksmith and salt-well driller, to aid in the endeavor. An engine house and derrick were constructed, and Drake purchased a , horizontal steam engine. The steam engine was used to ram the drill through the soil until it reached bedrock [...] down. After it was found that groundwater would cause the walls of the hole to collapse, Drake acquired [...] of <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipe</b> to stabilize the hole. After reaching bedrock, Drake and Smith were able to drill at a rate of [...] per day. Drake's colleagues back in Connecticut gave up on finding any oil by April1859 and after spending $2,500, Drake took out a $500 loan to keep the operation going. The drill reached its maximum depth of [...] on August27, 1859. Smith visited the well the next day and found oil visible on top of the water [...] {{from the top of the}} well.

40|$|Longitudinal {{fracture}} is one predominant observed {{failure mode}} in large diameter <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> installed between 1850 and early 1960 s. Some of these failures occur {{where there is}} evidence of some corrosion activity. This paper addresses three specific issues, namely, (1) review of expected loads, i. e., internal pressure, earth loads, traffic loads, (2) estimated pipe failure load (pipe resistance), and (3) estimated structural factor of safety. The second and third issues can be equally applicable to non-deteriorated and deteriorated pipes. The procedures described in this paper were motivated by the need to purposefully use the information derived from pipe inspection to assess the margin of safety of deteriorated large diameter <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipes.</b> A mechanistic model that accounts for <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> material non-linearity is described. The model is validated using data obtained from experimental tests conducted in the mid 1930 s on undamaged (new) pipes. The model is subsequently extended to permit the analysis of pipes with corrosion pits or corroded areas. Reliability analysis using Monte Carlo simulations is proposed to account for uncertainties in input data. Illustrative analyses of 162 ̆ 033 and 482 ̆ 033 diameter pipes subjected to vertical loads and internal pressure showed that significantly high margins of safety exist in <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> with no damage (due to corrosion and or casting voids) while this margin of safety is meaningfully reduced in the presence of corrosion pits or corroded areas. The methodology described should enable engineers to realistically assess the pipe resistance capacity and hence the corresponding margin of safety of undamaged or damaged <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> encountered in current operational conditions.

40|$|<b>Cast</b> <b>iron</b> water {{distribution}} <b>pipes</b> exist widely in UK and elsewhere. As these <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> were traditionally directly buried into local soil, where {{the soil is}} chemically aggressive (as {{in the case of}} some clays) corrosion of the pipes often occurs due to an electrochemical process, which both changes the pH environment and releases iron ions into the clay. This can cause chemical alteration to clay minerals and ‘corrosion products’, such as iron oxide, hydroxide and aqueous salts, to form in the soil. These chemical interactions are complex and time dependent, and can result in failure, and thus the conditions under which they occur need to be understood. Ground Penetration Radar (GPR) has been proposed for routinely detecting, assessing and monitoring buried <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipes,</b> and thus {{it is important to know}} how these chemical changes affect the electromagnetic properties of soil.
