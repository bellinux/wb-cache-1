40|$|A {{mathematical}} model {{was applied to}} predict energy used by <b>cold</b> <b>stores.</b> This was compared with actual energy consumption data collected {{in a survey of}} <b>cold</b> <b>stores.</b> The model was used to investigate different usage scenarios and varied ambient conditions around the chilled and frozen <b>cold</b> <b>stores.</b> This indicated that many chilled and frozen stores had very high usage and/or inefficient refrigeration systems. Less than 13 % of chilled and 12 % of frozen stores used less energy than an efficiently used store with an efficient refrigeration system. The model indicated that smaller stores of less than 25, 000 m 3 tended to use more energy than the model predicted, even at the least efficient, highest usage scenario. With further validation the model could be used to benchmark the energy usage of <b>cold</b> <b>stores</b> and help identify where energy savings could be best achieved...|$|R

40|$|Significant {{differences}} were found in sugar content and carbohydrate splitting enzyme activities in tubers of ten indigenous potato varieties at harvesting and after keeping at cold storage. The activities of invertase, amylase, β-galactosidase and cellulase in all varieties were found to be increased by 2 - 12, 1. 2 - 4, 1. 9 - 4. 5, and 1. 1 - 3. 7 folds, respectively from harvesting to <b>cold</b> <b>stored</b> potatoes. The amount of starch and sucrose were found to be decreased by 1. 15 - 2. 8 and 1. 02 - 1. 4 folds, respectively from harvesting to <b>cold</b> <b>stored</b> in all varieties.

5|$|As the Market {{was being}} built, a {{cut and cover}} railway tunnel was {{constructed}} underground City street level to create a triangular junction with the railway between Blackfriars and Kings Cross through Snow Hill Tunnel — closed in 1916, it has been revived and is now used for Thameslink rail services. The construction of extensive railway sidings, beneath Smithfield Park, facilitated the transfer of animal carcases to its <b>Cold</b> <b>Store,</b> and directly up to the Meat Market via lifts. These sidings closed in the 1960s, and are now used as a car park, accessed via a cobbled descent at the centre of Smithfield Park. Today, much of the meat is delivered to market by road.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, a large {{underground}} <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> at Smithfield was {{the theatre}} of secret experiments led by Dr Max Perutz on pykrete, {{a mixture of}} ice and woodpulp, believed to be possibly tougher than steel. Perutz's work, inspired by Geoffrey Pyke and part of Project Habakkuk, was meant to test the viability of pykrete as a material to construct floating airstrips in the Atlantic to allow refuelling of cargo planes in support of Admiral the Earl Mountbatten's operations. The experiments were carried out by Perutz and his colleagues in a refrigerated meat locker in a Smithfield Market butcher's basement, behind a protective screen of frozen animal carcasses. These experiments became obsolete {{with the development of}} longer range aircraft and the project was then abandoned.|$|E

40|$|Organic foods {{represent}} a significant market segment within the global food industry, since these prod-ucts are often {{believed to be}} safer and more nutritious than their conventional counterparts. Due to the growing importance of organic strawberry cultivation for several agricultural areas in Italy, we carried out a four year research (2008 – 2011) on Fragaria × ananassa grown under tunnel in Campania (southern Italy), {{with the purpose of}} assessing the effects of two farming systems (organic or conventional) combined with propagation material (fresh or <b>cold</b> <b>stored</b> plants) and crop duration (annual or biennial) on yield and quality. The experimental treatments were randomized in a split-plot design, assigning the farming systems to the main plots and the propagation material in factorial combination with the crop duration to the subplots, with three replicates. The conventional system produced the highest yield, {{as a consequence of the}} higher fruit number per plant, while the organic management resulted in increased berry mean weight. Organic fruits showed higher values of dry and optical residue and higher content of glucose, sucrose, vitamin C and ß-carotene but lower nitrate. Fresh plant crops produced a lower yield than the <b>cold</b> <b>stored</b> ones; moreover, the fruit production of fresh plants was higher when grown as an annual crops compared with a biennial cycle, independently on the farming system. In the case of <b>cold</b> <b>stored</b> plants, no yield differences were recorded between annual and biennial cultivations under conventional management, whereas organic crops from <b>cold</b> <b>stored</b> plants showed higher yields as annual crops compared with the biennial cycle. Fruit dry residue as well as sucrose, malic acid and mineral element content attained higher values in the fruits harvested from biennial crops than from the annual ones. The choice of organic system as an alternative to the conventional practice could be justified by the better fruit quality, lower environmental impact and higher market prices. Moreover, the biennial crop duration could be a cost effective option when the crop is started from <b>cold</b> <b>stored</b> plants under organic management...|$|R

40|$|Cold storage has {{not only}} been a good method to overwinter {{strawberry}} plants safely and {{to compensate for the}} lack of natural chilling. Initially <b>cold</b> <b>stored</b> plants were used for early spring cropping only. Meanwhile this technique has become a normal commercial practice among growers in central Europe and has given them the opportunity to extend the strawberry production season from July until January. <b>Cold</b> <b>stored</b> waiting bed plants have been used since the early seventies in The Netherlands and Belgium and currently represent an important part of strawberry production. These sixty-day-plants are planted mainly outdoors in the soil for a production from July until September. More recently waiting bed plants have gained popularity in the UK, Germany and northern Italy to extend the season. Alternatively in France and Germany <b>cold</b> <b>stored</b> runner (A+) plants are traditionally being used for a summer production outdoors followed by a spring crop. During the last decade module or tray plants have gained popularity for autumn cropping on substrate culture in plastic tunnels and greenhouses. During the most recent years the programmed ¿out of season¿ production of strawberries has become more important in several European countries.
