40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate the damage caused by defoliation in maize. The experiment was carried out in 2005 / 2006 at Roma Farm, Ituverava-SP, using the triple hybrid CODETEC 304 ®. The experiment consisted of split plots (split-plot), which were distributed at random in three blocks, with the main treatment manual defoliation (30 %, 40 %, 60 % and 80 % defoliation) in the plots and as the secondary treatment the phenological phases (D 1, D 2 and D 3) with three replicates for each treatment and a control plot (0 % defoliation) for each block. It was evaluated the production of plots (g/m 2), the average size of the spikes (cm) and the average weight of thousand grains (g). According to the results, it was concluded that the source-sink relations were negatively affected, and the treatment with 80 % defoliation was the one that most affected all variables, thus, it is a level of defoliation that is responsible for the largest losses, with no means of <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> the <b>maize</b> crop...|$|R

40|$|In South Sulawesi, {{the program}} <b>for</b> <b>maize</b> {{development}} (called Gong) {{has recently been}} implemented by the provincial government, as part of promoting regional food security program. In {{some parts of the}} region, cultivation of maize (Zea mays L.) has long been practiced in different soil environments including marginal land. To help address this phenomenon, {{there is a need for}} information that will allow land managers to identify both the inherent suitability of land <b>for</b> <b>maize</b> production and development, and the spatial distribution of land areas where possible development can be implemented taking into account present land use types. This paper describes a spatial based qualitative suitability evaluation of marginal soils <b>for</b> <b>maize</b> production and development at a region where marginal land predominates. The research project implements land suitability evaluation method based on the spatial-qualitative query approaches in Geographical Information Systems (GIS). The main sources of data bases used include digital topographic map, soil map and soil characteristics derived from available data at reconnaissance level and semi detailed survey, climate data, and satellite imagery. The results of analysis of potential development area <b>for</b> <b>maize</b> cultivation show that more than 90 percent of study region are suitable (at S 2 and S 3 classes) <b>for</b> <b>maize</b> cultivation. Comparing to the existing maize cultivation and land use types on the ground, about one third of the area is available <b>for</b> <b>maize</b> cultication (extensification). This study reveals that there are some limiting factors in term of chemical soil characteristics that can still be improved, but there will be almost no limitation in terms of land cover type <b>for</b> <b>maize</b> development.

40|$|Rice, a cash crop, {{was grown}} in the {{alluvial}} valley bottom (fadama) of an inland valley region of central Nigeria. The main staple crop, maize, was grown on the adjacent upland areas. Both oxen and manual labour were used for initial cultivation (ploughing and harrowing for rice and ridging <b>for</b> <b>maize).</b> Times spent were 94 • 3 and 315 • 2 h/ha respectively for rice and 28 • 2 and 65 • 5 h/ha <b>for</b> <b>maize.</b> Plots cultivated by animal traction (AT) produced more weeds and required more time for weeding than manually cultivated ones. Thus although animal traction saved time at the most critical time of year, it did not save time overall. Total time values were 1045 and 1064 h/ha for rice using animal traction and manual cultivation respectively. Corresponding values <b>for</b> <b>maize</b> were 654 and 484 h/ha.

40|$|This study {{examined}} whether <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> coarticulation in fricative–vowel syllables is phonologically mediated or {{a consequence of}} auditory processes. Smits (2001 a) had shown that <b>compensation</b> occurs <b>for</b> anticipatory lip rounding in a fricative caused by a following rounded vowel in Dutch. In a first experiment, the possibility that compensation is due to general auditory processing was investigated using nonspeech sounds. These did not cause context effects akin to <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> coarticulation, although nonspeech sounds influenced speech sound identification in an integrative fashion. In a second experiment, a possible phonological basis <b>for</b> <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> coarticulation was assessed by using audiovisual speech. Visual displays, which induced the perception of a rounded vowel, also influenced <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> anticipatory lip rounding in the fricative. These results indicate that <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> anticipatory lip rounding in fricative–vowel syllables is phonologically mediated.
