60|$|A {{triangular}} recess communicating by {{a heavily}} <b>curtained</b> <b>arch</b> {{with the huge}} ballroom of the palace. The light is subdued by red shades on the candles. In the wall adjoining that pierced by the arch is a door. The only piece of furniture is a very handsome chair on the arch side. In the ballroom they are dancing a polonaise {{to the music of}} a brass band.|$|R
50|$|It has 142 folios and 19 miniatures, and {{measures}} 372mm by 321mm. It {{is thought to}} have originally included as many as 68 full page miniatures. A full page table containing the Latin names of the books and Latin transliterations of the Hebrew names serves as a front piece to Genesis. The table is enclosed within a <b>curtained</b> <b>arch.</b> Some of the full page miniatures, such as that containing the miniature of Noah's Ark (folio 9r), contain a single scene. Other full page miniatures, such as that telling the story of Cain and Abel, contain many scenes which are placed in a register, with each scene having a different color background.|$|R
6000|$|The boy bowed again, {{and going}} to an archway, held aside the {{curtains}} for them. They first swam into a small anteroom which led into a long corridor, {{at the end of}} which was another <b>curtained</b> <b>arch.</b> Through this Sacho also guided them, and now they found themselves in a cleverly constructed maze. Every few feet were twists and turns and sharp corners, and sometimes the passage would be wide, and again so narrow that they could just squeeze through in single file. [...] "Seems like we're gettin' further into the trap," [...] growled Cap'n Bill. [...] "We couldn't find our way out o' here to save our lives." ...|$|R
40|$|Photograph of the {{interior}} of Mission Santa Inez in Solvang, showing choir loft, ca. 1904. The <b>curtain</b> forming the <b>arches</b> {{at the top of}} the loft is made of rawhide painted by the Indians. The open main entry is directly below the loft. Pictures hang on both side walls. A few pews are visible in the foreground...|$|R
5000|$|Though talking {{pictures}} {{had been}} successfully introduced in 1927 {{and the new}} Orpheum Theatre was equipped with talking picture equipment on its opening in October 1928, it was still common for vaudeville and movie theatres to be equipped with a theatre pipe organ for use either alone or {{in combination with other}} instruments. The theatre owners contracted with the Wurlitzer Company for a three manual, 13 rank pipe organ, style 240. The instrument was shipped from the factory on September 25, 1928, and given opus number (serial number) 1956. [...] The pipes are located in two purpose-built, hidden chambers behind the large <b>curtained</b> <b>arches</b> flanking the proscenium, at approximately the height of the forward-most chandeliers. The [...] "Main Chamber" [...] is on house right with eight ranks (sets) of pipes, and the [...] "Solo Chamber" [...] has five ranks of pipes on the house left side. In total there are just over 1,100 pipes, ranging from approximately 16 ft {{to the size of a}} pencil. Additionally, most of the organ's percussion instruments, marimba, xylophone, drums and so forth, are placed in the Solo Chamber. The organ is also equipped with a number of sound effects to accompany silent movies: bird whistles, fire alarms, horse hoofs, etc. The organ console was placed on a screw-drive lift at the left side of the orchestra pit allowing the organist to raise the console into the audience's view while playing or lower it out-of-sight when not in use. Additionally, a large electric blower to provide the organ's compressed air, is placed in a sound-proof room below the stage.|$|R
2500|$|The {{proscenium}} arch housed a [...] drop <b>curtain.</b> The <b>arch</b> itself was not {{integral to the}} theatre but was constructed with a lightweight, plastered curtain wall made of wood. The drama was entirely lit with gaslight controlled by a man at a gas table, who could light a lamp through an electric spark and vary {{the intensity of the}} light through gas flow. Arrayed {{on the side of the}} {{proscenium arch}} were gas-lit border lamps, equipped with tin reflectors that cast light backstage and onto the borders. Each border lamp was in a wire cage intended to keep the canvas borders at least a foot (...) away from the gas lamps within. Personnel were forbidden to ignite gaslights with matches or smoke anywhere on the stage.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{offended}} you again, Mr. Bradley," [...] she said. [...] "Please be Christian, and pardon me. You {{know this}} is a season of peace and goodwill." [...] She raised her blue eyes at the same moment to the Christmas decorations on the ceiling. They were standing before the parted drapery of the lance window. Midway between the <b>arched</b> <b>curtains</b> hung a spray of mistletoe--the conceit of a mischievous housemaid. Their eyes met it simultaneously.|$|R
50|$|The {{proscenium}} arch housed a 35 x 50 ft drop <b>curtain.</b> The <b>arch</b> itself was not {{integral to the}} theatre but was constructed with a lightweight, plastered curtain wall made of wood. The drama was entirely lit with gaslight controlled by a man at a gas table, who could light a lamp through an electric spark and vary {{the intensity of the}} light through gas flow. Arrayed {{on the side of the}} {{proscenium arch}} were gas-lit border lamps, equipped with tin reflectors that cast light backstage and onto the borders. Each border lamp was in a wire cage intended to keep the canvas borders at least a foot (1 ft) away from the gas lamps within. Personnel were forbidden to ignite gaslights with matches or smoke anywhere on the stage.|$|R
60|$|The {{morning was}} hot and Betty had pulled the <b>curtains</b> across the <b>arch.</b> She typed an English letter and thought about Kit. Although she knew {{he had gone to}} Mrs. Austin's, it was some days since she had seen him and his steamer would soon sail. Betty had {{expected}} him to say good-bye to her and was hurt because he had not. Presently she heard Jefferson's step in the patio. He stopped and somebody crossed the flags.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of {{two views}} of the {{proscenium}} arch in the Mayan Theater, ca. 1925. The image is a composite of two photographs: the top photo shows the main stage from the balcony, its curtain depicting {{what appears to be}} a jungle scene. The lower image depicts the same stage in three-quarters profile with a different, more abstract <b>curtain</b> lowered. The <b>arch</b> itself is decorated with faux-Mayan relief carvings. The orchestral pit can be seen in both photos, although it is more prominent in the lower image...|$|R
5000|$|The {{church is}} made of brick on a stone {{foundation}} and covered in a tin roof. The nave is rectangular, the altar arched. The bell tower sits atop the foyer; it is prism-shaped, with a square base, and has four <b>curtained</b> windows. An <b>arch</b> separates the vestibule from the nave, and both have half-sphere ceilings. Another arch, above the iconostasis, separates the nave from the altar. The church is sometimes called Prepodobna (Slavonic for [...] "most holy"), Sf√¢nta Vineri or Vinerea Mare (another name for Parascheva).|$|R
50|$|The {{striking}} {{building with}} its crimson paint and extensive decoration, is situated with its eaves to the Minster Square (Freiburg im Breisgau).The high housetop with two attic stories is lined by crow-stepped gables. From the outside the four arcades with an access balcony facing the Minster are an eye-catching {{feature of the}} building. At ground level one enters through a gate a hall, which opens onto an inner courtyard. This hall is only {{open to the public}} on special occasions. Situated above the hall is one room that takes up the entire upper floor. The room has so-called <b>arched</b> <b>curtain</b> windows in the late Gothic style with the windows opening onto the market place. Two delicate, polygonal bay windows with colored tiles flank the <b>arched</b> <b>curtain</b> windows {{on the outside of the}} building. The front of the building is decorated with sculptures and the crest of the House of Habsburg, which were carved by Hans Sixt von Staufen between 1520 and 1531. The sculptures all have a baldachin and depict Maximilian I (Holy Roman Emperor), Philip I of Castile, Charles V (Holy Roman Emperor) and Ferdinand I (Holy Roman Emperor). The statues are replicas as the originals are stored away from the elements in the Basler Hof. The five emblems under each of the bay windows depict territorial dominions belonging to the House of Habsburg.|$|R
60|$|Betty's {{typewriter}} stopped. The {{light in}} the patio was strong and to sit in her dark office and study the group outside was like watching a play on an illuminated stage. The <b>curtains</b> at the <b>arch</b> narrowed her view, and the figures of the actors, sharply distinct, occupied the opening. Betty's sense of the dramatic was keen, and she had remarked that Wolf sat down where a beam shone over his shoulder. Then when Jefferson talked about Chicago and Munich she thought he tried to study Wolf's face, but could not. Wolf had {{hesitated for a moment}} before he admitted that he knew the cities. Betty rested her face in her hand and resolved to watch. For one thing, Wolf was Kit's employer.|$|R
50|$|Within the building, {{much was}} {{accomplished}} {{in addition to}} the structural restoration. The box seats, <b>curtain</b> and proscenium <b>arch</b> were restored to their original appearance. Actual dressing rooms were built, along with a crossover behind the stage. The second story was finally established as the lobby and the corner space at street level was set aside for a bar. To its west, the entry space was converted into a box office, which the building had previously lacked. A passenger elevator was built to make the theater wheelchair accessible. That allowed the addition of an interior fire stair, which in turn led to the much-desired removal of the fire escape. A restaurant, Bentley's, opened in the ground floor space where the Wheeler Bank had once been, with an art gallery in the corner space. Both businesses leased the space on an annual basis at below-market rates; the proceeds were used by the city to fund an annual arts grant program.|$|R
50|$|In the past, artists used natural colours like {{vegetable}} and mineral dyes, whereas {{the present day}} artists use chemical paints. For outlines dark brown or red was usually used. Red was favoured for the background, though blue and green were also used. Lord Vishnu, was coloured blue, and Lord Nataraja chalk white, and his consort Goddess Sivakami was green. The sky, of course, was blue, but black was also employed on occasions. The portrayal of figures in the paintings was also typical with almost all the figures having rounded faces with almond-shaped eyes and smooth, streamlined bodies. The composition is static and two-dimensional with the figures placed within <b>arches,</b> <b>curtains</b> and decorative borders. The main subject is {{much larger than the}} other subjects and occupies the centre of the painting. Seraphs or angels resembling those in European paintings and Islamic miniatures were also shown flanking the main figure. The figures were painted with bright flat colours except for the face where shading was shown. The shading in Thanjavur art was more to create a feeling of depth than to conform to the European conventions of lighting and perspective.|$|R
60|$|The {{interior}} of Westminster Abbey (for the reader recognized it, no doubt, {{the moment we}} entered) is built of rich brown stone; and the whole of it--the lofty roof, the tall, clustered pillars, and the pointed arches--appears to be in consummate repair. At all points where decay has laid its finger, the structure is clamped with iron or otherwise carefully protected; and being thus watched over,--whether {{as a place of}} ancient sanctity, a noble specimen of Gothic art, or an object of national interest and pride,--it may reasonably be expected to survive for as many ages as have passed over it already. It was sweet to feel its venerable quietude, its long-enduring peace, and yet to observe how kindly and even cheerfully it received the sunshine of to-day, which fell from the great windows into the fretted aisles and arches that laid aside somewhat of their aged gloom to welcome it. Sunshine always seems friendly to old abbeys, churches, and castles, kissing them, as it were, with a more affectionate, though still reverential familiarity, than it accords to edifices of later date. A square of golden light lay on the sombre pavement of the nave, afar off, falling through the grand western entrance, the folding leaves of which were wide open, and afforded glimpses of people passing to and fro in the outer world, while we sat dimly enveloped in the solemnity of antique devotion. In the south transept, separated from us by the full breadth of the minster, there were painted glass windows of which the uppermost appeared to be a great orb of many-colored radiance, being, indeed, a cluster of saints and angels whose glorified bodies formed the rays of an aureole emanating from a cross in the midst. These windows are modern, but combine softness with wonderful brilliancy of effect. Through the pillars and arches, I saw that the walls in that distant region of the edifice were almost wholly incrusted with marble, now grown yellow with time, no blank, unlettered slabs, but memorials of such men as their respective generations deemed wisest and bravest. Some of them were commemorated merely by inscriptions on mural tablets, others by sculptured bas-reliefs, others (once famous, but now forgotten generals or admirals, these) by ponderous tombs that aspired towards the roof of the aisle, or partly <b>curtained</b> the immense <b>arch</b> of a window. These mountains of marble were peopled with the sisterhood of Allegory, winged trumpeters, and classic figures in full-bottomed wigs; but it was strange to observe how the old Abbey melted all such absurdities into the breadth of its own grandeur, even magnifying itself by what would elsewhere have been ridiculous. Methinks it is the test of Gothic sublimity to overpower the ridiculous without deigning to hide it; and these grotesque monuments of the last century answer a similar purpose with the grinning faces which, the old architects scattered among their most solemn conceptions.|$|R
