60|$|Long {{before getting}} your most {{excellent}} letter of Feb. 21st I had been pricked with shame and remorse at my long silence; you may imagine then how this pang sharpened when, {{three or four}} days ago, that letter arrived. There were all sorts of reasons for my silence which I won't take up time now with narrating--further than to say that they were not reasons of misfortune or discomfort--but only of other-engagement-and-occupation pressure--connected with arrears of writing, <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> in furnishing and preparing my new habitation, and the constant old story of London interruptions and distractions. Thank God I am out of them far more now than I have ever been before--in my chaste and secluded Kensington quatrième. I moved in here definitely only three days ago, and am still rather upside down. The place is excellent in every respect, improves on acquaintance every hour and is, in particular, flooded with light like a photographer's studio. I commune with the unobstructed sky and have an immense bird's-eye view of housetops and streets. My rooms are very pretty as well as very convenient, and will be more so when little by little I have got more things. When I have time I will make you a diagram, and later, when the drawing-room (or library: meantime I have a smaller sitting-room in order) is furnished (I have nothing for it yet), I shall have the place photographed. I shall do far better work here than I have ever done before.|$|E

Of these 2 are very interested, 8 become interested,the rest {{are not interested}} but may read {{all or part of}} the message anyway, spending their time.Some of these 20 people will forward the message to their friends. The process repeats - resultingin an exponentially increasing <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> by those uninterested in the message (as wellas an exponentially increasing <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> by people who are or become interested - which maydistract them from other more productive tasks). Eventually, when the expected number of people forwardinga message drops below 1, the process dies out, but in the interim it may circulate widely - resultingin a potentially massive waste of resources. Much of the time wasted will be due to a senseof social obligation to at least scan or check on the title of the message.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the effects of}} industrial policies in dynamic economy with international trade and monopolistic competition. Special {{attention is paid to}} saving, international capital flow, and welfare of all the trading economies. The effects of industrial policies in one country spill over to its trading partners through changes in terms of trade and productivity. Considering such effects, the paper shows that industrial policies in one country increase <b>consumption</b> and saving <b>of</b> all the trading countries. The effects on welfare of foreign coun¬tries are identical to those of domestic economy. If the movement of capital among countries is perfect, the movements <b>of</b> <b>consumption</b> over <b>time</b> <b>of</b> all countries also become identical...|$|R
50|$|Theoretically, the {{consumption}} of luxury products (goods and services) {{is limited to the}} leisure class, because the working classes have other, more important, things and activities on which to spend their limited income, their wages. Yet, such is not the case, because the lower classes consume expensive alcoholic beverages and narcotic drugs. In doing so, the working classes seek to emulate the standards of life and play of the leisure class, because they are the people “at the head of the social structure in point of reputability”. In that emulation of the leisure class, social manners are a result of the non-productive, <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> by the upper social classes; thus the social utility of conspicuous consumption and of conspicuous leisure lies in their wastefulness of time and resources.|$|E
50|$|Veblen defines leisure as the non {{productive}} <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> The wealthy consume time unproductively {{due to a}} disgust of menial labor but also as evidence of their pecuniary ability to live idle lives. But {{there are moments when}} even the noble is not viewed publicly and then he must give a satisfactory account of his use of time. Often his account will manifest through the appearance of servants or some sort of craftsmen. A material proof of leisure is another way that the noble demonstrates his wealth even when he is out of the public's eye. Objects or trophies or knowledge that has no real-world application are all examples {{of the things that the}} wealthy use to demonstrate their wealth and their leisure. Displaying rules of etiquette and breeding, and formal and ceremonial observances are other demonstrations of unproductive (and therefore leisurely) uses of time.|$|E
5000|$|Economists {{typically}} use {{the term}} consumption {{in a way that}} is far broader than merely purchasing something. It is quite common to talk about the <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Many of the items on this list can still be considered either production or consumption, or to involve production or consumption at some stage to be accomplished. For example, cooking a meal is production of food for someone's consumption, and it involves consuming (cooking) raw materials previously purchased or gathered; and, writing is production of material for someone to consume through reading. Both of these activities are often done for some return in value, whether it is for respect or monetary payment. In a similar way, some of these items are replacements for consumption [...] - [...] for example, rather than purchase a meal, you can cook the meal yourself. In cooking the meal, you have now in effect paid for the meal with your own labor rather than earning wages and paying for a meal with those wages. In this way, economists, and in general anyone, could view this list as containing nothing that is not consumption or production, other than possibly turning around in a circle, though this involves consuming calories that would, at some point, have been consumed. For example, even window shoppers are consuming [...] - [...] the product is marketers’ production (specifically in this case, the window dresser's creation). Possibly, only in death are we neither consuming nor producing, but merely being consumed, though it could be argued that one's body is consuming space, particularly in a cemetery plot (real estate), but even if cremated and scattered. Gary Becker's household production functions and similar topics note that people often purchase goods and then combine them with time to produce something that has meaning or practicality to them (which produce utility).|$|E

We propose and discuss the use of the concurrency control support of the local DBMS for detecting conflicts between local transactions and writesets of remote transactions. This allows to simplify many database replication protocols and to enhance their performance. ...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a number}} of models and {{strategies}} for {{improving the quality of}} care such as total quality management, continuous quality improvement and clinical governance. The policy of clinical governance is part of the governments overall strategy for monitoring, assuring and improving in the national health services organization. Clinical governance has been introduced as a bridge between managerial and clinical approaches to quality. For successful implementing of clinical governance, it is necessary to pay attention to firm foundations of the structure, including equipment, staffing arrangement, supporting specialties, and staff training. Therefore, as clinical governance improves safety and quality in health care services, the current situation in hospitals should be evaluated before any intervention while barriers and blocks on structure and process should be determined to select a method for changing them. Considering these points could guarantee success in implementation of clinical governance; otherwise there would be a little chance to achieve the desired results despite <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> plenty <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and huge paper works...|$|R
