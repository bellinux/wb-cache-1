5|$|In places, the {{seemingly}} at odds architectural styles {{can be viewed}} simultaneously; this is particularly so in the chimney stacks which resemble Islamic minarets. These coupled with the <b>castellated</b> parapets add {{what appears to be}} an almost Moorish element to the late English Renaissance air of the northern facade.|$|E
5|$|While {{the designs}} for the corps de logis were {{confined}} by the foundations of Harrison's earlier plan, the secondary wings and precincts were not. Abandoning completely Harrisons concept of bedrooms set in terraces beneath the corp de logis, Blore's assistant architect, Hunt, opted for the typical vast sprawling wings and servants' quarters of the 19th century English country house. These took {{full advantage of the}} gradients and topography of the site, and with their courtyards came to resemble a small medieval, fortified town of towers and high <b>castellated</b> walls. Nowhere is this more evident than the Shuvalov Passage, an enclosed carriage drive squeezed between the high walls of two wings, leading from the <b>castellated</b> Western Gatehouse to the forecourt before the northern facade. The passage, which twists and turn beneath high wall and towers and even passes under a bridge, resembles the street of a medieval town, rather than the approach to a country house.|$|E
5|$|Luscombe Castle is {{a country}} house {{situated}} near the resort town of Dawlish, in the county of Devon in England. Upon purchasing the land at Luscombe in 1797, Charles Hoare demolished the existing house and commissioned architects John Nash and Humphrey Repton to design a new house and gardens at the site. Nash and Repton {{came up with an}} asymmetrical designed building made from Portland stone, with <b>castellated</b> parapets, turrets and pinnacles to create the feel of a picturesque castle.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} was constructed of Portland stone, largely over two storeys {{but with a}} three story octagonal tower between the two wings, {{as well as a}} square tower to the north above the porte-cochère. The walls feature <b>castellated</b> parapets, turrets and pinnacles, giving the building the feel of a castle in the gothic style. The building has an asymmetric feel, in a picturesque style, with varying shapes and elevations to different sections. The intent was to give a castle style to the building, reminiscent of historical fortresses, but with the comfortable interior of a house.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower at}} {{the west end of}} the church dates from the early 17th century. It sits next to the {{south-west}} corner of the nave, aligned with the south wall, because the former church plan included a north aisle; the north wall of the tower meets the nave at its roof ridge. It is <b>castellated</b> and constructed of coursed roughly-dressed stone. It has two diagonal buttresses, two angled buttresses and four corner pinnacles. There are slate belfry louvres {{on each side of the}} tower and clock faces on the north and south sides.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the period}} of {{absolute}} monarchy, from 1782 to 1932, the Grand Palace was both the country's administrative and religious centre. As the main residence of the monarch, the palace was also the seat of government, with thousands of inhabitants including guardsmen, servants, concubines, princesses, ministers and courtiers. The palace's high whitewashed <b>castellated</b> walls and extensive forts and guard posts mirrored those of the walls of Bangkok itself, and thus the Grand Palace was envisioned as a city within a city. For this reason a special set of Palace Laws were created to govern the inhabitants and to establish hierarchy and order.|$|E
5|$|The Manor of Deptford or West Greenwich was {{bestowed}} by William the Conqueror upon Gilbert de Magminot or Maminot, {{bishop of}} Lisieux, {{one of the}} eight barons associated with John de Fiennes for the defence of Dover Castle. Maminot held the head of his barony at Deptford and according to John Lyon writing in 1814, he built himself a castle, or <b>castellated</b> mansion at Deptford, of which all traces had by then long since been buried in their ruins, but from the remains of some ancient foundations which had been discovered the site was probably on the brow of Broomfield, near the Mast Dock and adjacent to Sayes Court.|$|E
5|$|The house, {{along with}} Dinefwr Castle, {{have since been}} {{restored}} by the National Trust and Cadw respectively. It is a three-storey <b>castellated</b> structure, built from grey stone, with four tall towers in each corner, with sloping slate roofs. The front features a grand central porch. Two rooms {{are open to the}} public, including a tearoom and exhibition in the basement and ground floor which contain numerous displays related to the history of the estate and occupants. The deer park which surrounds the property was landscaped by Capability Brown in 1775. The surrounding woodland consists mainly of oak and wych elm. Newton House is cited {{as one of the most}} haunted houses in Wales, noted in particular for its ghost of Walter the Butler, a former employee whose tobacco smoke purportedly wafts through the air.|$|E
5|$|Nineteenth-century {{interiors}} could {{often be}} lavish and eclectic. The origins of this style were in Scott's Abbotsford, where the author began {{the incorporation of}} actual old architectural fragments and pieces of furniture on a lavish scale (the effective beginning of 'antique' collecting in Scotland). He also initiated the treatment of new surfaces so as to resemble old ones, with new wood darkened to resemble old oak. The Adam solution of a <b>castellated</b> exterior with a neo-classical interior was abandoned and in Baronial revival houses this change was extended to create a synthesised Victorian style that combined elements of the Renaissance, such as plastered or rubble walls, unpainted stone fireplaces and pitch pine timberwork, with seventeenth-century style plaster ceilings. To this were added symbols of landed power and national affiliation, including displays of tartan, weaponry and stuffed animals' heads. Integrated into these traditional materials and styles were modern fittings such as sprung upholstery, gaslighting and water-closets.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Henry's expansion, StPeter ad Vincula, a Norman chapel which had {{previously}} stood outside the Tower, was incorporated into the castle. Henry decorated the chapel by adding glazed windows, and stalls {{for himself and his}} queen. It was rebuilt by EdwardI at a cost of over £300 and again by HenryVIII in 1519; the current building dates from this period, although the chapel was refurbished in the 19thcentury. Immediately west of Wakefield Tower, the Bloody Tower was built {{at the same time as}} the inner ward's curtain wall, and as a water-gate provided access to the castle from the River Thames. It was a simple structure, protected by a portcullis and gate. The Bloody Tower acquired its name in the 16thcentury, as it was believed to be the site of the murder of the Princes in the Tower. Between 1339 and 1341, a gatehouse was built into the curtain wall between Bell and Salt Towers. During the Tudor period, a range of buildings for the storage of munitions was built along the inside of the north inner ward. The castle buildings were remodelled during the Stuart period, mostly under the auspices of the Office of Ordnance. In 1663 just over £4,000 was spent building a new storehouse (now known as the New Armouries) in the inner ward. Construction of the Grand Storehouse north of the White Tower began in 1688, on the same site as the dilapidated Tudor range of storehouses; it was destroyed by fire in 1841. The Waterloo Block, a former barracks in the <b>castellated</b> Gothic Revival style with Domestic Tudor details, was built on the site and remains to this day, housing the Crown Jewels on the ground floor.|$|E

25|$|The rectory is {{immediately}} {{to the south of}} the church and dates from around 1890. It is in the Tudor style, of red brick with stone dressings and a <b>castellated</b> slate roof. It is a Grade II listed building.|$|E
25|$|Broadward Hall is a Grade II Listed building, {{largely a}} 19th-century remodelling of an 18th-century house, with a <b>castellated</b> Gothic appearance. Broadward dates back much earlier however, {{and was a}} medieval {{settlement}} with township status within the Clungunford parish. The hall is a private residence and is not open to visitors.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} is a three-level red-brick structure with limestone footings and Donnybrook stone trimmings. There is a square tower, originally intended to be central, with <b>castellated</b> parapets. The interiors exhibit fine craftsmanship in joinery, with jarrah timber panelling and art nouveau leadlighting and glass. A grand staircase of jarrah connects the three levels of the building.|$|E
25|$|Arrows {{were used}} as a remembrance of the first Christian place of worship {{established}} in the region which was dedicated under the patronage of St. Sebastian. There are pineapples interspersed to reflect the native agriculture. A <b>castellated</b> wall surmounts the shield to show the city's having been granted status as a municipality by the Spanish Crown.|$|E
25|$|Jezreel {{wanted the}} new HQ to {{be a perfect}} cube, each side 144ft long. The architects, however, persuaded him the design was {{impractical}} and he agreed to modified version — 124ft on each side and 120ft high at each corner. It was to be built of steel and concrete with yellow brick walls and eight <b>castellated</b> towers. The trumpet and flying roll, crossed swords of {{the spirit and the}} Prince of Wales feathers (signifying the Trinity), were to be engraved on the outer walls.|$|E
25|$|Timothy Pont's map, c.1604, as {{published}} by Joan Blaeu in Amsterdam (1654) , shows Kilbirnan Castle (sic), as this date precedes {{the building of}} the mansion house wing. John Adair's map of c.1685 shows a <b>castellated</b> structure recorded as Kilburny. Roy's map of 1747 shows the castle and the landscaped avenue feature. A Mains Farm is shown located near to Kilbirnie Kirk. The 1832 Thomson map records 'Killbirny House' and shows a lane running directly from the house to the kirk. The 1856 OS map of refers to 'Kilbirnie House'.|$|E
25|$|In about 1835, Scott took on William Bonython Moffatt as his {{assistant}} and later (1838–1845) as his partner. Over {{ten years or}} so, Scott and Moffatt designed more than forty workhouses, during the boom in building such institutions {{brought about by the}} Poor Law of 1834. In 1837 they built the Parish Church of St John in Wall, Staffordshire. At Reading, they built the prison (1841–42) in a picturesque, <b>castellated</b> style. Scott's first church, St Nicholas', was built at Lincoln, after winning a competition in 1838. With Moffat he built the Neo-Norman church of St Peter at Norbiton, Surrey (1841).|$|E
25|$|Penny {{made a few}} {{alterations}} to the mansion: {{he added}} the <b>castellated</b> and glazed porch to the South front, removing the earlier porch to the garden where it became a clock tower. He also and made a new entrance to the priest house. Penny then suffered a blow to his own fortunes: he {{was found to be}} rather cavalier in his passing on the taxes he collected to the crown, and was dismissed from office. He died in 1730 having executed no further work to the estate. The house and estate were then put up for auction in 1731 and sold for a price of £15,492.10s.|$|E
25|$|An Caisteal, which {{qualifies as}} a Munro, {{is located in a}} popular area for hill walking within a group of seven Munros and {{fourteen}} tops which stand on the eastern side of Glen Falloch in the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park. The mountain reaches a height of 995 metres (3,264 feet) and is usually climbed in conjunction with the neighbouring Munro of Beinn a' Chroin to which it is connected by a high col to the south east. The mountains name translates from the Gaelic as “the castle” and is believed to refer to the prominent <b>castellated</b> rocks close to the mountain's summit which serve as an easy way of identifying the mountain from a distance.|$|E
25|$|Stoke Newington East and West Reservoirs, to {{the north}} of Clissold Park, are quite {{substantial}} for urban facilities. Stoke Newington Reservoirs were constructed in 1833 to purify the New River water and to act as a water reserve. The West Reservoir is now a leisure facility, offering sailing, canoeing and other water sports, plus Royal Yachting Association-approved sailing courses. On its western edge stands the former filter house, now set out as a visitor centre with a café; some of the old hydraulic machinery can be viewed in the main hall. The pumping station at the reservoir gates, converted to a climbing centre in 1995 was designed in a distinctive <b>castellated</b> style by Robert Billings under the supervision of William Chadwell Mylne and built in 1854–56.|$|E
25|$|Both {{north and}} south chapels have canopied niches: the south chapel one each {{either side of a}} c.1916 stained glass window; the north, one at the {{north-east}} corner. The north chapel also contains a piscina. In the south chapel at the east wall, in an opening leading from the chapel to the chancel, is a blind doorway. At the south side is a piscina, an aumbry and a stoup. There is an elaborate canopied relief tomb niche, without tomb, with internal arch, with decorative bosses above, holding a cinquefoil with foliate bosses attached, and spandrels containing shields. The south chapel west stained glass window is c.1892. The north chapel has mirrored a more elaborate tomb niche including spandrels containing angels holding shields, and a <b>castellated</b> top with foliate cross.|$|E
25|$|Above {{the west}} tower door {{is a large}} blocked pointed arch, {{chamfered}} above the spring, and vertically edged with round moulded jambs ending in open cusped devices. Around the arch is a hood mould. Within the arch is a 14th-century (Pevsner) or late 15th-century (National Heritage) window surrounded by a hood mould. The window opening jambs are single-chamfered, with the arch double-chamfered, and lead to a Perpendicular window. The {{lower part of the}} window is of three lights, separated by chamfered mullions and divided and topped by transoms containing <b>castellated</b> details, with tracery of trefoil heads and spandrels. Two further ranks of lights above are subdivided vertically into panel tracerya Perpendicular style of upright straight openings above lower lightswith 'Y' tracery, trefoil heads, and quatrefoil openings. All lights are clear glazed within diamond leading.|$|E
25|$|Ghan House. A Georgian House {{built by}} William Stannus in 1727 it is {{surrounded}} by <b>castellated</b> walls and a guard tower. The first floor contains the drawing room which has a decorative ceiling of rococo plasterwork of flower garlands and medallion busts reputed to be of Stannus ladies. The basement contains two underground passageways (now blocked) {{that led to the}} Heritage Centre and the bakers (now chemist). The latter tunnel was reportedly used by a silent order of monks who once lived on the site and apparently supplied the local bakery but wished to avoid contact with townspeople. Today Ghan House is used as a guest house (with wine bar), ballroom, meeting room and cookery school. The current chefs of Ghan House are Stephane Le Sourne and Allan Maynard.|$|E
25|$|Neo-Gothic and Arts and Crafts artists {{working in}} {{northern}} England {{in the last}} half of the 19thcentury were in some ways rebelling against the uncontrolled progress, noise, smoke, mechanisation and materialism of the Industrial Revolution. They looked back to a more spiritual Golden Age of Romantic fairy stories of magic, knights and castles, and revelled in hand-made artefacts. Many of Barber's works reflect this, with their <b>castellated</b> towers and interiors of elegant carvings and jewel-coloured glass, all of which he designed and commissioned himself. However all this had to be paid for, and clients' money was often ultimately sourced from the great mills and sweated labour of Victorian West Yorkshire; an example of this is Spring Hall, Halifax, designed by Barber and funded by Tom Holdsworth of John Holdsworth & Co. Ltd.|$|E
25|$|The Brushes {{was located}} at the {{junction}} of Longley Lane and Barnsley Road. It was built in 1790, however Brushes Farm existed on the site in the 1640s, {{at the time of}} the English Civil War when its first resident Captain Burley was executed in 1646 for siding with the Royalists. The Booth family bought the farm in 1708 and John Booth who had made his wealth through iron and steel production built The Brushes mansion next to the farm in 1790. Charles Kayser became the owner in 1888 and he demolished the farm and built a <b>castellated</b> tower to complement the mansion. In 1920 the building became Firth Park Grammar School after being purchased by Sheffield Corporation for £22,000. The building was demolished in 2002-03 and Longley Park Sixth Form College now stands in its place.|$|E
25|$|Traces {{of these}} {{activities}} remain today, mainly as building foundations and pottery fragments. Waugh was also responsible for expanding the number of buildings on the island – creating the now ruined village of Maryland (named after Waugh's wife), as well as adding a new gatehouse and tower in the Tudor style. Waugh also paid {{for the construction of}} a new pier, adorned with <b>castellated</b> watch towers. Another large expenditure was the construction of St Mary's church, built in the Gothic style and also was named for his wife. The foundation stone was laid by Sir Harry Smith in 1853 and construction was completed a year later. Inside the church there is a monument to Waugh as well as the tomb of the late owner Charles van Raalte. Part of the church is dedicated to the Scouting movement and the flags of the Scout and Girl Guide movements line either side of the main altar.|$|E
25|$|The tracks from Glasgow {{enter at}} {{the east end of}} the wide {{concourse}} which is flanked to the north and south by high stone walls, each capped {{at the east}} end by a <b>castellated</b> turret. A glazed roof between these walls sheltered the concourse until recently, but it has been removed and small shelters introduced. The northernmost line stops as a bay platform and is not in use, and platform 1 serving eastbound trains opens directly to the top of Station Avenue which slopes down to Cathcart Street through stone archways marking the station entrance. The two tracks in use continue westwards through a tunnel which is capped by the parapet wall to Terrace Road, which leaves Cathcart Street further to the west and rises steeply towards the station before turning south over the tunnel entrance and continuing to {{rise to the level of}} the Well Park. Doorways in the parapet wall lead to staircases down to each platform, and to a steel ramp down to Platform 2 serving westbound trains. Originally, there was only one doorway, which led to a sloping passageway which in turn connected with the (now removed) station's internal steel lattice footbridge.|$|E
25|$|Unlike his similar {{project at}} Beaulieu Abbey, {{which he had}} also been granted by King Henry, Wriothesley chose to convert the main abbey buildings, {{including}} the church, into his house. It was an imaginative scheme, built {{under the direction of}} master mason Thomas Bartewe, a prominent contractor for King Henry's contemporary fortification works along the South Coast. He constructed a spectacular <b>castellated</b> gatehouse with four octagonal turrets which was forced through the middle of the nave to provide the appropriate seigneurial emphasis needed for a classic Tudor courtyard house. The cloister became the central courtyard of the house (a magnificent fountain was placed in the middle), the old refectory, {{with the addition of a}} grand porch, became the great hall, while the rest of the abbey was turned into fine apartments for the family. The church tower was initially kept as part of the house but it was soon demolished on the advice of John Crayford, one of the king's commissioners who helped to oversee the reconstruction on behalf of Wriothesley. Crayford was anxious to see the tower pulled down as, if it was left standing, the chimneys would have to be raised some twenty feet higher - and at great cost - to avoid defacing the church tower with their smoke. Other features of the mansion included a private indoor theatre and a deer park.|$|E
25|$|For {{the purpose}} of writing The Manxman Caine rented Greeba Castle for six months, a <b>castellated</b> house in the Isle of Man {{overlooking}} the Douglas to Peel road. It was this book, published as one volume in August 1894 by Heinemann, that ended the outdated system of three-volume novels. It {{is the story of}} Pete, a fisherman, considered by Kate’s father as too poor to marry her. Pete leaves to make his fortune, and is reported dead. Kate falls in love with Philip, Pete’s cousin and friend. Pete returns, creating a dilemma. The character of Pete was based on the Peel fishermen Caine mixed with and Joseph Mylchreest, a Manxman who made his fortune diamond mining in South Africa. Caine took full advantage of the subsequent Press attention. He was photographed and interviewed for the monthly magazines. The British sales of The Manxman totalled nearly 400,000. It was translated into twelve languages, selling over half a million copies by 1913. While in London in June and July 1984, Caine wrote a dramatic version of The Manxman, with Philip as the main character. Caine offered it to Herbert Beerbohm Tree, who refused it as being unlikely to appeal to the Haymarket Theatre audiences. On 22 August 1894, three weeks after the book was published, Wilson Barrett’s adaptation opened at the Grand Theatre, Leeds. Caine bought the Greeba Castle estate in 1896 with part of his earnings from The Manxman.|$|E
