5|$|The Puerto Rico Department of the Family {{currently}} {{provides the}} benefits to each participating family through a debit card, which replaced the physical cheques in the early 2000s. The monthly benefit is deposited through an electronic benefit transfer (EBT) system into a government-designated personal bank account, which can be accessed at any time with the debit card to withdraw cash or to make food purchases from authorized retailers. Since September 2001, 75% of each family’s monthly benefit has been designated exclusively for making direct food and grocery purchases, while the remaining 25% can be withdrawn as a <b>cash</b> <b>benefit.</b> The EBT debit card system has improved the program’s payment accuracy rate to 96.4% in 2003, 4 years ahead of its 2007 goal of 95% accuracy.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, the Social Security Administration (SSA) {{has placed}} a greater {{emphasis}} on increasing employment among people who receive federal disability benefits while also reducing their reliance on those benefits. SSA’s efforts have led to a growing interest among policymakers in exactly how many disability beneficiaries forgo <b>cash</b> <b>benefits</b> because they are working and how long they are able to remain off <b>cash</b> <b>benefits.</b> In this brief, we summarize findings from a longer report by Stapleton et al. (2010 a), who used a newly developed indicator to determine how many beneficiaries receiving Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) forgo <b>cash</b> <b>benefits</b> because of work. 1 Each year, SSA publishes information about work activity among beneficiaries. Those statistics tend to show relatively little beneficiary employment; indeed, only about one percent of beneficiaries each year have had their <b>cash</b> <b>benefits</b> suspended or terminated because of work. 2 However, the statistics do not paint a complete picture of the number who forgo <b>cash</b> <b>benefits</b> for work because they exclude beneficiaries who have worked {{for a long time and}} are therefore no longer formally connected to SSA programs. To develop a better idea of how many beneficiaries work, SSA and Mathematica Policy Research developed an indicator for “nonpayment status following suspension or termination for work ” (NSTW), based on a complex set of SSA administrative data. 3 This indicator captures all months that beneficiaries have given up <b>cash</b> <b>benefits</b> specifically because of work (as opposed to other factors such as medical improvement), even if they have not received benefits in years. Using the NSTW indicator, we produced statistics on the beneficiaries in each year from 2002 through 2006 who had at least one month without <b>cash</b> <b>benefits</b> because of work. 4 We also determined the amount of time these individuals remained in NSTW. ...|$|R

40|$|Parental leave {{regulations}} in most OECD countries have two key policy instruments: job protection and <b>cash</b> <b>benefits.</b> This paper studies how mothers 9 ̆ 2 {{return to work}} behavior and labor market outcomes are affected by alternative mixes of these key policy parameters. Exploiting a series of major parental leave policy changes in Austria, we find that longer <b>cash</b> <b>benefits</b> lead to a significant delay in return to work and that {{the magnitude of this}} effect depends on the relative length of job protection and <b>cash</b> <b>benefits.</b> However, despite their impact on time on leave, we do not find a significant effect on mothers 9 ̆ 2 labor market outcomes in the medium run, neither of benefit duration nor of job-protection duration. To understand the relative importance (and interaction) of the two policy instruments in shaping mothers 9 ̆ 2 return to work behavior, we set up a non-stationary job search model in which <b>cash</b> <b>benefits</b> and job protection determine decisions of when to return to work and whether or not to return to the pre-birth employer. Despite its lean structure, the model does surprisingly well in matching empirically observed return to work profiles. The simulation of alternative counterfactual regimes shows that a policy that combines both job protection and benefits payments succeeds to induce mothers {{to spend some time with}} the child after birth without jeopardizing their medium run labor market attachment...|$|R
40|$|Welfare state {{models have}} focused almost {{exclusively}} {{on the study of}} <b>cash</b> <b>benefits,</b> and typologies established on this limited basis have been used to generalise about all forms of welfare state provision.

This article explores the cash and services mix in, and between, welfare states with reference to recent welfare state typologies, most notably Esping-Andersen's decommodification-centred ‘worlds of welfare’. It compares the decommodification levels of the main <b>cash</b> <b>benefits</b> with the main area of service provision: health care. The resulting analysis suggests that when services are added into the comparative analysis of welfare state regimes there are five welfare state clusters: Social Democratic, Liberal, Conservative, and sub-groups within both the Liberal and Conservative regimes.
