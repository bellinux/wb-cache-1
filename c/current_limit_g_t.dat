Petersen proved that if c {{is in the}} p/q -limb of the Mandelbrot set, then tends to infinity in as λ tends to radially. Epstein showed that after normalizing and passing to a subsequence, the q -th iterate converges to a degree two rational map of the form.      Our main goal is {{to determine how the}} <b>limiting</b> map <b>G</b> <b>T</b> depends on c.

40|$|Measuring {{spectral}} {{distortions of}} {{the cosmic microwave background}} (CMB) is attracting considerable attention as a probe of high energy particle physics in the cosmological context, since PIXIE and PRISM have recently been proposed. In this paper, CMB distortions due to resonant conversions between CMB photons and light axion like particles (ALPs) are investigated, motivated by the string axiverse scenario which suggests the presence of a plenitude of light axion particles. Since these resonant conversions depend on the strength of primordial magnetic fields, constraints on CMB distortions can provide an upper limit on the product of the photon-ALP coupling constant g and the comoving strength of primordial magnetic fields B. Potentially feasible constraints from PIXIE/PRISM can set a <b>limit</b> <b>g</b> B < 10 ^- 16 GeV^- 1 nG for ALP mass, m_ϕ < 10 ^- 14 eV.

40|$|We show that, by {{studying}} the arrival times of radio pulses from highly-magnetized pulsars, {{it may be possible}} to detect light spin- 0 bosons (such as axions and axion-like particles) with a much greater sensitivity, over a broad particle mass range than is currently reachable by terrestrial experiments and indirect astrophysical bounds. In particular, we study the effect of splitting of photon-boson beams under intense magnetic field gradients in magnetars and show that radio pulses (at meter wavelengths) may be split and shift by a discernible phase down to a photon-boson coupling constant of g ~ 1 e- 14 [1 /GeV]; i. e., about four orders of magnitude lower than <b>current</b> upper <b>limits</b> on <b>g.</b> The effect increases linearly with photon wavelength with split pulses having equal fluxes and similar polarizations.
