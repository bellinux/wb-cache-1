50|$|Crown shyness (also canopy disengagement, canopy shyness, or intercrown spacing) is a {{phenomenon}} observed in some tree species, in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not touch each other, forming a canopy with <b>channel-like</b> gaps. The phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of the same species, but also occurs between trees of different species. There exist many hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavior, and research suggests that it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.|$|E

50|$|The stylostome is {{a funnel}} or <b>channel-like</b> {{structure}} formed {{in response to}} trombiculid mites. The formation is not caused by the mouthparts of the mites, because these mites do not have needle-like mouthparts as other hematophagous animals {{have been known to}} have, but have chelicerae, which only pierce the skin. The tube is formed by the digestive enzymes in the saliva, which is the same salivary secretions that break down cells that is causing the surrounding tissue to harden. As the mite feeds longer, the saliva seeps farther down, and digesting more tissue, therefore causes the stylosome to penetrate to lower layers of skin.|$|E
50|$|Transmembrane <b>channel-like</b> protein 1 is {{a protein}} that in humans is encoded by the TMC1 gene. TMC1 {{contains}} six transmembrane domains {{with both the}} C and N termini on the endoplasmic side of the membrane, {{as well as a}} large loop between domains 4 and 5. This topology {{is similar to that of}} transient receptor potential channels (TRPs), a family of proteins involved in the perception of senses such as temperature, taste, pressure, and vision. TMC1 has been located in the post-natal mouse cochlea, and knockouts for TMC1 and TMC2 result in both auditory and vestibular deficits (hearing loss and balance issues) indicating TMC1 is a molecular part of auditory transduction.|$|E

50|$|Maruyama et al. {{showed that}} MgtE {{exhibits}} the <b>channel-like</b> electrophysiological properties, i.e., Mg2+ transport occurs {{in accordance to}} the electrochemical potential of Mg2+. The Mg2+-permeation pathway opens {{in response to a}} decrease of the intracellular Mg2+ concentration, while it is completely closed at the intracellular Mg2+ concentration of 10 mM. The crystal structures of the MgtE dimer reveal that the Mg2+-sensing cytoplasmic region consists of the N and CBS domains. The Mg2+-bound state adopts a compact, globular conformation, which is stabilized by the coordination of a number of Mg2+ ions between these domains. On the other hand, in the Mg2+-unbound state, these domains are far apart, and fixed by the crystal packing.|$|E

Globules (probably made of water ice) 10-15 cm in size lie above darker, finer-grained substrate in a variable spatial distribution. Brightening {{of the upper}} left side of several rocks suggests solar illumination from that direction, implying a southerly view, which agrees with preliminary evidence from other data sets. A region with a relatively low number of rocks lies between clusters of rocks in the foreground and the background and matches the general orientation of <b>channel-like</b> features in the low-altitude images taken from under 7km altitude.|$|E

50|$|Guppies {{are highly}} {{prolific}} livebearers. The gestation {{period of a}} guppy is typically 21-30 days, varying considerably. Reproduction typically continues through the year, and the female becomes ready for conception again quickly after parturition. Male guppies, like {{other members of the}} Poeciliidae family, possess a modified tubular anal fin called the gonopodium, located directly behind the ventral fin. The gonopodium has a <b>channel-like</b> structure through which bundles of spermatozoa, called spermatozeugmata, are transferred to females. In courted mating, where the female shows receptive behavior following the male's courtship display, the male briefly inserts the gonopodium into the female's genital pore for internal fertilization. However, in the case of sneaky mating where copulation is forced, the male approaches the female and thrusts the gonopodium at the female's urogenital pore.|$|E
5000|$|NCS1 {{proteins}} are H+/Na+ symporters specific for the uptake of purines, pyrimidines {{and related}} metabolites. Krypotou et al. 2015 studied the origin, diversification and substrate specificities of fungal NCS1 transporters, {{suggesting that the}} two fungal NCS1 subfamilies, Fur and Fcy, and plant homologues, originated through independent horizontal transfers from prokaryotes. [...] Expansion by gene duplication led to functional diversification of fungal NCS1 porters. They characterized all Fur proteins in Aspergillus nidulans. Homology modelling, substrate docking, molecular dynamics and systematic mutational analysis in three Fur transporters with distinct specificities identified residues critical for function and specificity, located within a major substrate binding site, in transmembrane segments TMS1, TMS3, TMS6 and TMS8. They predicted and confirmed that residues determining substrate specificity are located {{not only in the}} major substrate binding site, but also in a putative outward-facing selectivity gate. Their evolutionary and structure-function analyses led to the concept that selective <b>channel-like</b> gates may contribute to substrate specificity.|$|E
50|$|Depth {{filters are}} {{the variety of}} filters that use a porous {{filtration}} medium to retain particles throughout the medium, rather than just {{on the surface of}} the medium. These filters are commonly used when the fluid to be filtered contains a high load of particles because, relative to other types of filters, they can retain a large mass of particles before becoming clogged.Depth filtration typified by multiple porous layers with depth are used to capture the solid contaminants from the liquid phase. Due to the tortuous and <b>channel-like</b> nature of the filtration medium, the particles are retained throughout the medium within its structure, as opposed to on the surface. Depth filters pose the added advantage that they are able to attain a high quantity of particles without compromising the separation efficiency. Depth filters are commonly characterised by the sand filter and have the ability to be used with substantially higher filter rates than in other designs. It is these characteristics that have cemented the use and popularity of depth filters as an effective medium for separation. With ongoing advances in process technologies depth filter designs are continuously adapting and improving to meet the needs of industry.|$|E
50|$|Both ends of {{the channel}} are obscured, however, so its {{original}} length is unknown. The channel was initially discovered by the Soviet Venera 15 and 16 orbiters which, {{in spite of their}} one-kilometer resolution, detected more than 1,000 km of the channel. These <b>channel-like</b> features are common on the plains of Venus. In some places they appear to have been formed by lava which may have melted or thermally eroded a path over the plains' surface. Most are 1 to 3 kilometers (0.6 to 2 miles) wide. They resemble terrestrial meandering rivers in some aspects, with meanders, cutoff bows and abandoned channel segments. However, Venus channels are not as tightly sinuous as terrestrial rivers. Most are partly buried by younger lava plains, making their sources difficult to identify. A few have vast radar-dark plains units associated with them, suggesting large flow volumes. These channels with large deposits appear to be older than other channel types, as they are crossed by fractures and wrinkle ridges, and are often buried by other volcanic materials. In addition, they appear to run both upslope and downslope, suggesting that the plains were warped by regional tectonism after channel formation.|$|E
50|$|The Müritz Basin {{is divided}} into several large bays. Unlike the shallow {{eastern part of the}} lake, the western side {{is divided into}} several <b>channel-like</b> inlets like the Bays of Röbel and Sietow (Röbeler Bucht and Sietower Bucht). By the town of Waren on the {{northern}} shore of the lake is the Binnenmüritz, which contains the deepest point of the lake (−31 metres), and only has a narrow strait connecting it to the main basin of Lake Müritz. At the southern shore is the Little Müritz (Kleine Müritz) from which the Müritzarm and the Müritzsee branch off further to the south. Lake Müritz measures about 29 km from north to south and about 13 km from east to west; and has a catchment area of about 663 km2. The Müritz is crossed by the River Elde from south to north and has a link to the Kölpinsee in the west from the Binnenmüritz via the Reeck Canal (also Eldenburg Canal) which is a good two kilometres long. Because it also feeds the River Havel to the east via the Mirow Canal, {{which is part of the}} Müritz-Havel Waterway, and the Bolter Canal as well as via the chains of adjoining lakes, it has artificially been turned into a bifurcated waterway.|$|E

40|$|Remarkable polygenetical {{structures}} were observed at a refinery rehabilitation site in Wedel/Holstein. The polygonal shaped, <b>channel-like</b> structures are incised in mid-Saalian clayey, chalk-rich till. They are symmetrically semicircular shaped {{and filled with}} calcareous, silty sands that {{can be interpreted as}} sandy reworked till with aeolian components. The width reaches from approx. 0. 3 to 1. 5 metres, the depth up to approx. 0. 8 metres. Horizontal cracks up to more than 10 meters in lengths, occurring as narrow belts of sand with reddish colour, are often centrally aligned in the <b>channel-like</b> structures. The present-day red colour is not natural but related to pollution. These belts reach {{down to the bottom of}} the channel like structures. At the lower site of the <b>channel-like</b> structures glacitectonic fissures with a width up to a few centimetres were to be traced into a depth of several metres to the basis of the excavat ion.

40|$|Drugs of abuse, {{including}} cocaine, amphetamine (AMPH), and heroin, elevate extracellular dopamine (DA) {{levels in}} the brain, thereby altering the activity/plasticity of reward circuits and precipitating addiction. The physiological release of DA occurs through the calcium-dependent fusion of a synaptic vesicle with the plasma membrane. Extracellular DA is cleared by uptake through the Na+/Cl [...] dependent DA transporter (DAT). In contrast, the substrate AMPH induces nonvesicular release of DA mediated by DAT. Extracellular AMPH is generally believed to trigger DA efflux through DAT by facilitating exchange for cytosolic DA. Here, in outside-out patches from heterologous cells stably expressing DAT or from dopaminergic neurons, by using ionic conditions in the patch pipette that mimic those produced by AMPH stimulation, we report that AMPH causes DAT-mediated DA efflux by two independent mechanisms: (i) a slow process consistent with an exchange mechanism and (ii) a process that results in rapid (millisecond) bursts of DA efflux through a <b>channel-like</b> mode of DAT. Because <b>channel-like</b> release of DA induced by AMPH is rapid and contains {{a large number of}} DA molecules, with a single burst of DA on par with a quantum of DA from exocytotic release of a vesicle, this burst mode of release {{may play a role in}} the synaptic actions and psychostimulant properties of AMPH and related compounds. Unlike AMPH, the endogenous substrate DA, when present on both sides of the plasma membrane, inhibits this <b>channel-like</b> activity, thereby suggesting that the DAT <b>channel-like</b> mode cannot accumulate DA against a concentration gradient...|$|E

The resulting solid catalyst showed higher activity (TOF: 4800 vs. 936 h(- 1)) and enantioselectivity (96. 0 % vs. 94 % ee) than its homogeneous counterpart in the asymmetric hydrogenation of itaconic acid dimethyl ester under similar conditions, {{probably due to}} the high dispersion of Rh-MonoPhos on mesoporous silicas. Significant rate enhancement was observed with Rh-MonoPhos immobilized on mesoporous silicas with cage-like pores in comparison with <b>channel-like</b> pores, reflecting that cage-like pores could facilitate the mass transport.

40|$|A {{model of}} {{porosity}} {{development has been}} developed to investigate general relationships between simple fracture aperture growth laws and fracture porosity in evolved fracture arrays in aquifers. The growth of fracture apertures in two-dimensional orthogonal arrays with initially spatially uncorrelated lognormal aperture distributions has been studied, where aperture growth rate is proportional to an exponent of the flow rate through each fracture. The evolved arrays show geometrical phase changes {{as a function of}} the aperture growth rate exponent, e, and the standard deviation of the initial aperture distribution, ?z. Low values of e and ?z lead to bimodal aperture distributions, where apertures parallel to flow are preferentially enlarged. At moderate values of e and ?z, there is a transition to a regime of more complex geometries consisting of networks of <b>channel-like</b> structures of preferentially enlarged apertures. At larger values of e, array-spanning <b>channel-like</b> paths of preferentially enlarged apertures develop, where the tortuosity of the <b>channel-like</b> paths is a linear function of ?z. Following an initial growth phase, during which dynamically stable aperture configurations develop, arrays undergo simple amplification. The geometry of the evolved aperture fields is diverse and they can be highly complex; consequently, parameterization and prediction of their evolution in terms of the initial aperture distributions and growth rate laws is not trivial. <br/...|$|E
