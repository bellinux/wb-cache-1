25|$|Agriculture’s role in {{developed}} countries has drastically <b>changed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> century due to many factors, including refrigeration. Statistics from the 2007 census gives information on the large concentration of agricultural sales coming from {{a small portion of}} the existing farms in the United States today. This is a partial result of the market created for the frozen meat trade by the first successful shipment of frozen sheep carcasses coming from New Zealand in the 1880s. As the market continued to grow, regulations on food processing and quality began to be enforced. Eventually, electricity was introduced into rural homes in the United States, which allowed refrigeration technology to continue to expand on the farm, increasing output per person. Today, refrigeration’s use on the farm reduces humidity levels, avoids spoiling due to bacterial growth, and assists in preservation.|$|E

25|$|Much about Canadian {{federalism}} has undoubtedly <b>changed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> fifteen years, {{although it}} is also true that much remains the same. The foundations of Canadian federalism were laid at the Quebec Conference of 1864. The Quebec Resolutions were a compromise between those who wanted sovereignty vested in the federal government and those who wanted it vested in the provinces. The compromise based the federation on the constitution of the British Empire, under which the legal sovereignty of imperial power was modified by the conventions of colonial responsible government, making colonies of settlement (such as those of British North America) self-governing in domestic affairs. A protracted political process ensued before the Quebec Resolutions became the British North America Act of 1867. This process was dominated by John A. Macdonald, who joined British officials in attempting to make the federation more centralized than that envisaged by the Resolutions.|$|E

2500|$|Reflectors and {{reflective}} tape provide additional visibility (especially {{when applied to}} moving parts of the bicycle) and are mandatory in many jurisdictions. Pedal reflectors in particular are very visible to following traffic as they move up and down; unfortunately they are not compatible with most clipless pedal systems, although adaptors are available for some, mainly older SPD models, and a few single-sided designs are available with built-in reflectors. [...] In the UK, where front and rear pedal reflectors are compulsory after dark, most cyclists with clipless pedals are therefore riding illegally. [...] The law is rarely if ever enforced, but could potentially be used in court to reduce financial compensation if the cyclist were {{to be hit by}} another vehicle. [...] The CTC have suggested that the requirement should be waived if the cyclist fits an additional rear reflector or lighting, but this was not <b>changed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> revision of the UK vehicle lighting laws (which permitted flashing LEDs). [...] Riders of recumbent bicycles have pointed out that the pedal reflector requirement is nonsensical for them, since the reflectors point straight up and down in use, and are invisible from other vehicles. [...] As of 2008, California law allows white or yellow shoe reflectors (front and back), or reflective ankle bands, in lieu of pedal reflectors.|$|E

60|$|A {{few days}} before, and while staying with his Castlewood relatives, Harry, who loved cards, and cock-fighting, and betting, and every {{conceivable}} sport himself, {{would have laughed}} very likely at this confession. Amongst that family into whose society he had fallen, many things were laughed at, over which some folks looked grave. Faith and honour were laughed at; pure lives were disbelieved; selfishness was proclaimed as common practice; sacred duties were sneeringly spoken of, and vice flippantly condoned. These were no Pharisees: they professed no hypocrisy of virtue, they flung no stones at discovered sinners:--they smiled, shrugged their shoulders, and passed on. The members of this family did not {{pretend to be a}} whit better than their neighbours, whom they despised heartily; they lived quite familiarly with the folks about whom and whose wives they told such wicked, funny stories; they took their share of what pleasure or plunder came to hand, and lived from day to day till their last day came for them. Of course there are no such people now; and human nature is very much <b>changed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> hundred years.

6000|$|You next {{remark that}} Abolitionism does not predominate at the North. I admit {{that for many}} years it did not, but lately it has {{acquired}} an ascendency & is now wielding its baneful influence {{on the minds of}} the masses. It is true there are many good people there whose minds are too pure to be tainted by such an almost infidel spirit as pervades the breasts of Abolitionists; yet the party in power has been elevated by such vast majorities of the people, in that section, that, to one investigating the matter, it seems the public sentiment at the North has greatly <b>changed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> few years. In such a country as ours--a democratic one--the masses are governed by a few great leaders; these leaders, whether in power or not, are still the almost despots who rule us. Their actions give fruit and coloring to the character of the sections over which they sway their autocratic sceptres. Who then can doubt the Aboli^n propensities of the N. when such men as Beecher, Greeley, Webb, Phillips, Sumner, & a host of kindred spirits, are the giant levers in the machinery of their society? It will not do to say that these are disregarded by sensible people there, for I know too well their power for evil. I know that Dr. Hodge--a man whom I love next to my Father--stated, in his article on [...] "the state of the Country," [...] {{that he did not know}} of 12 abolitionists [...] "within the circle of his acquaintance." [...] But the Dr. was either woefully mistaken or he didn't consider his pupils as belonging to that circle; for to my certain knowledge there were twice that number within the walls of [...] "Princeton" [...] at the time he made the assertion, and many of these avowedly such--men who, I was astonished to see, withheld their names when the same Dr. H. came round with a petition to Congress for [...] "the restoration of the Mis. Comp." [...] & the repeal of the [...] "Personal Liberty Bills." [...] These young men were embryo Ministers--men whose moral influence must be powerful for good or for evil. How is it then you can assert that the North don't want the extinction of slavery when such men as I have mentioned exert every effort to prevent its extension & not that only, but the operation of the fugitive S. law? I am aware that you stated the contrary in your letter--that the North are ever [...] "rigorous" [...] in its execution; nor am I so ungallant as to doubt your veracity; but I think you have not fully informed yourself on this point, else you would have learned that in scarcely an isolated case has the Master ever recovered his property without being put to more expense & trouble than the negro was worth; although I am free to admit, that at the same time it cost the U.S. gov. an equal if not greater Amount. Of course I refer to those negroes who have not merely crossed the limits of a Slave State, & thus been caught, but gone some distance North. Now the obligation to restore a fugitive Slave is a constitu^l. & moral obligation; and those laws designed to prevent such restoration are unconst^l & criminal--and worthy of all condem^n.--and unbecoming the dignity of any Sov^n. State. If people of any State can't conscientiously submit to the Constitution there are only 2 courses: they should endeavor to have it peaceably altered, or should move out of the Country. This is the opinion of the most learned and liberal men. They have no right to live under the protec^n. of a Const^n. & yet refuse to submit to its stipulations. True enough, as you say, the North wish not to have the Negroes set free in their midst, to overrun and disturb them--this they declare by their actions, for they take no care for or interest in the poor free (almost) brutes in their midst;--yet how soon will they be ready to resist you most violently should you attempt to take even one of them back, from his then wretched abode, to his former happier place in the service of a kind Master? [...] "Oh! consistency, thou art a jewel!" [...] This then has been one of the two great causes of the present troubles. The other--the denial of equal rights in the Territories--is still a greater, because it involves a principle; the former was more a matter of personal interest. The territories being purchased in common, were the com. pos. of North and South. Each had a Const^l right to emigrate thither with their property & demand for it the protection afforded by the Const^n. It became, in course of time, a matter of dispute whether the South could take their slaves there as property. (As a matter of course this arose from jealousy--the N. having no such prop, to take.) This great quest. was decided, however, by the Chief Justice in the highest Tribunal in the world, in favor of the South; viz. that slaves were property. I refer to the [...] "Dred Scott" [...] Case. This should have been sufficient, as it came from the highest authority in the Gov^t. But some parties and people are never satisfied. Full in the face of this high official the Repub^n Party declare by their Platform orators, & Press, that slavery shall never enter another foot of territory. Now if the South admit this principle they acknowledge their inferiority to the North--an act that, even in the eyes of the North, would not comport with their dignity & honor as an independent & free people. The South being thus oppressed then I assert they have a right (not to secede, for no such right exists in my conception, as it would be an element subversive of any, & especially of a Repub^ln gov.,) to revolt--a right inherent in & beyond the control of all earthly govern^ts. Yes I coincide with the great Lord Chatham when he says that [...] "Rebellion against oppression is obedience to God." [...] Our Ancestors rebelled against the tyranny of British usurpation, & the Texans revolted against a like despotism exercised by a Mexican Autocrat. Why then are the Sovereign States of America not justifiable in throwing off the yoke or rather resisting to have put upon them, the yoke, of Northern Tyranny? To make the argument still clearer, however, as to the Territories, let us illustrate it: Suppose a Repub^n. Congress decides that slavery shan't be protected in the Ter. as prop. I take my slave thither. An indictment is brought against me. I am tried and condemned by the territorial court. I appeal from its decision to the Sup. Court of the U.S. What then? From analogy I conclude that I shall be acquitted, i.e., recover my property. For one Chief Justice has already decided thus; and is not his decision final? Here then is an end of the matter; since the Sup. Court is the Sole Arbiter in determining the Constitutionality of any of Congress' acts.|$|E
