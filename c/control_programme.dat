5|$|In 1994, when Bakili Muluzi became president, he {{addressed}} the nation's need for a coordinated response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In 2000, Muluzi introduced another five-year policy known as the National Strategic Framework, but, like Banda's five-year World Bank Medium Term Plan, this plan was largely ineffective. In 2001, in response to problems within the National AIDS <b>Control</b> <b>Programme</b> established by Banda, Muluzi created the National AIDS Commission. Unlike Banda, who prevented the public from accessing information about the epidemic, Muluzi ensured that information about HIV/AIDS was available {{on the radio and}} television, in newspapers, and on billboards. However, despite Muluzi's efforts, HIV prevalence was already significantly influencing national agricultural productivity during this period, and Malawi experienced an AIDS-related nationwide famine in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The {{first case}} of HIV/AIDS in Malawi was {{reported}} at Lilongwe's Kamuzu Central Hospital in 1985. President Hastings Banda, {{who was in}} power at the time, responded with several small-scale prevention initiatives and created the National AIDS <b>Control</b> <b>Programme,</b> {{a division of the}} Ministry of Health, to manage the growing epidemic. Banda believed that issues relating to sex, including HIV transmission, should not be addressed in the public sphere; during this time, it was illegal for Malawian citizens to discuss the epidemic openly. In 1989, Banda introduced a five-year World Bank Medium Term Plan to combat the epidemic, but HIV prevalence had already increased drastically at this point.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} decades, many {{regional}} and country-wide <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> for Johne's disease (JD) were developed due to associated economic losses, {{or because of}} a possible association with Crohn's disease. These <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> were often not successful, partly because management protocols were not followed, including the introduction of infected replacement cattle, because tests to identify infected animals were unreliable, and uptake by farmers was not high enough because of a perceived low return on investment. In {{the absence of a}} cure or effective commercial vaccines, control of JD is currently primarily based on herd management strategies to avoid infection of cattle and restrict within-farm and farm-to-farm transmission. Although JD <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> have been implemented in most developed countries, lessons learned from JD prevention and <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> are underreported. Also, JD <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> are typically evaluated in a limited number of herds and the duration of the study is less than 5 year, making it difficult to adequately assess the efficacy of <b>control</b> <b>programmes.</b> In this manuscript, we identify the most important gaps in knowledge hampering JD prevention and <b>control</b> <b>programmes,</b> including vaccination and diagnostics.

25|$|Workshops that {{involved}} key government agencies were also held within China to further foster cross-sector communications. The organization of Chinese government services is traditionally hierarchical and departmentalized, not directly cultivating cooperation and collaboration across sectors.

The WHO Global Programme on AIDS, and subsequently UNAIDS, together with other UN agencies in Asia and the Pacific, such as the UN Drugs <b>Control</b> <b>Programme</b> (now the UN Office of Drugs and Crime), had important roles in working {{with the government of}} China to organize and facilitate cross-sector discussions.|$|E

A public interest litigation was filed in the Supreme court in 1996 to abolish the practice of selling blood which became effective on 1 January 1998.

40|$|Integrated vector {{management}} (IVM) {{is defined}} as "a rational decision-making process for the optimal use of resources for vector control" and includes five key elements: 1) evidence-based decision-making, 2) integrated approaches 3), collaboration within the health sector and with other sectors, 4) advocacy, social mobilization, and legislation, and 5) capacity-building. In 2004, the WHO adopted IVM globally for the control of all vector-borne diseases. Important recent {{progress has been made}} in developing and promoting IVM for national malaria <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> in Africa at a time when successful malaria <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> are scaling-up with insecticide-treated nets (ITN) and/or indoor residual spraying (IRS) coverage. While interventions using only ITNs and/or IRS successfully reduce transmission intensity and the burden of malaria in many situations, it is not clear if these interventions alone will achieve those critical low levels that result in malaria elimination. Despite the successful employment of comprehensive integrated malaria <b>control</b> <b>programmes,</b> further strengthening of vector control components through IVM is relevant, especially during the "end-game" where control is successful and further efforts are required to go from low transmission situations to sustained local and country-wide malaria elimination. To meet this need and to ensure sustainability of control efforts, malaria <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> should strengthen their capacity to use data for decision-making with respect to evaluation of current vector <b>control</b> <b>programmes,</b> employment of additional vector control tools in conjunction with ITN/IRS tactics, case-detection and treatment strategies, and determine how much and what types of vector control and interdisciplinary input are required to achieve malaria elimination. Similarly, on a global scale, there is a need for continued research to identify and evaluate new tools for vector control that can be integrated with existing biomedical strategies within national malaria <b>control</b> <b>programmes.</b> This review provides an overview of how IVM programmes are being implemented, and provides recommendations for further development of IVM to meet the goals of national malaria <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> in Africa...|$|R
40|$|Since 2004 the West African {{countries}} of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger have implemented national schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> with financial and technical {{support from the}} Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI). In {{the first three years}} of the <b>control</b> <b>programmes,</b> nearly 13 · 5 million doses of praziquantel and albendazole have been administered against schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis with coverage rates varying between 67 · 0 % and 93 · 9 %. These treatments have resulted in a reduction of the prevalence and intensity of Schistosoma infection in the sentinel cohorts that were set up to monitor and evaluate the national <b>control</b> <b>programmes.</b> The challenges currently faced by these national <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> are the ability to maintain the reduction in morbidity achieved thus far due to the mass treatment campaigns and ensuring sustainability. For reinforcement of surveillance, the establishment of a geographical information system is suggested in order to contribute towards enhanced sustainability of these programmes. Our new working hypothesis is that targeted control accompanied by periodic mass treatment campaigns (every two to three years) can contribute to maintaining the low levels of morbidity achieved thus far. The implementation of integrated neglected tropical disease <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> in these countries will provide means to ensure the financial sustainability of control activities for the years to come...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Considerable {{declines in}} malaria have {{accompanied}} increased funding for control since the year 2000, but historical failures to maintain gains against the disease underscore {{the fragility of}} these successes. Although malaria transmission can be suppressed by effective control measures, {{in the absence of}} active intervention malaria will return to an intrinsic equilibrium determined by factors related to ecology, efficiency of mosquito vectors, and socioeconomic characteristics. Understanding where and why resurgence has occurred historically can help current and future malaria <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> avoid the mistakes of the past. Methods A systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify historical malaria resurgence events. All suggested causes of these events were categorized according to whether they were related to weakened malaria <b>control</b> <b>programmes,</b> increased potential for malaria transmission, or technical obstacles like resistance. Results The review identified 75 resurgence events in 61 countries, occurring from the 1930 s through the 2000 s. Almost all resurgence events (68 / 75 [*]=[*] 91 %) were attributed at least in part to the weakening of malaria <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> for a variety of reasons, of which resource constraints were the most common (39 / 68 [*]=[*] 57 %). Over half of the events (44 / 75 [*]=[*] 59 %) were attributed in part to increases in the intrinsic potential for malaria transmission, while only 24 / 75 (32 %) were attributed to vector or drug resistance. Conclusions Given that most malaria resurgences have been linked to weakening of <b>control</b> <b>programmes,</b> there is an urgent need to develop practical solutions to the financial and operational threats to effectively sustaining today’s successful malaria <b>control</b> <b>programmes.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Control {{operations}} targeting Animal African Trypanosomiasis and {{its primary}} vector, the tsetse, were covering approximately 128, 000 km 2 of Africa in 2001, {{which is a}} mere 1. 3 % of the tsetse infested area. Although extensive trypanosomiasis and tsetse (T&T) control operations have been running {{since the beginning of}} the 20 th century, Animal African Trypanosomiasis is still a major constraint of livestock production in sub-Saharan Africa. We performed a systematic review of the existing literature describing T&T <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> conducted in a selection of five African countries, namely Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Uganda and Zambia, between 1980 and 2015. Sixty-eight documents were eventually selected from those identified by the database search. This was supplemented with information gathered through semi-structured interviews conducted with twelve key informants recruited in the study countries and selected based on their experience and knowledge of T&T control. The combined information from these two sources was used to describe the inputs, processes and outcomes from 23 major T&T <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> implemented in the study countries. Although there were some data gaps, involvement of the target communities and sustainability of the control activities were identified as the two main issues faced by these programmes. Further, there was a lack of evaluation of these <b>control</b> <b>programmes,</b> as well as a lack of a standardised methodology to conduct such evaluations. Past experiences demonstrated that coordinated and sustained control activities require careful planning, and evidence of successes, failures and setbacks from past <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> represent a mine of information. As there is a lack of evaluation of these programmes, these data have not been fully exploited for the design, analyses and justification of future <b>control</b> <b>programmes...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Jon Gettman, in Science and the End of Marijuana Prohibition, {{claims that}} [...] "if {{prohibition}} {{ends in the}} U.S. it must also end world-wide because U.S. law requires that we amend international drug control treaties to correspond with our own findings on scientific and medical issues". This is at least partially correct; 21 U.S.C. § 811(d)(2)(B) of the Controlled Substances Act states that if the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs proposes rescheduling a drug, the HHS Secretary [...] "shall evaluate the proposal and furnish a recommendation to the Secretary of State which shall be binding on {{the representative of the}} United States in discussions and negotiations relating to the proposal".

40|$|Funding {{agencies}} are dedicating substantial resources to tackle helminth infections. Reliable {{maps of the}} distribution of helminth infection can assist these efforts by targeting control resources to areas of greatest need. The ability to define the distribution of infection at regional, national and subnational levels has been enhanced greatly by the increased availability of good quality survey data and the use of model-based geostatistics (MBG), enabling spatial prediction in unsampled locations. A major advantage of MBG risk mapping approaches is that they provide a flexible statistical platform for handling and representing different sources of uncertainty, providing plausible and robust information on the spatial distribution of infections to inform the design and implementation of <b>control</b> <b>programmes.</b> Focussing on schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis, with additional examples for lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis, we review the progress made to date with the application of MBG tools in large-scale, real-world <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> and propose a general framework for their application to inform integrative spatial planning of helminth disease <b>control</b> <b>programmes...</b>|$|R
