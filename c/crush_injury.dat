500|$|The muscle {{damage is}} most often {{the result of a}} <b>crush</b> <b>injury,</b> strenuous exercise, medications, or drug abuse. Other causes include infections, {{electrical}} injury, heat stroke, prolonged immobilization, lack of blood flow to a limb, or snake bites. Some people have inherited muscle conditions that increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis. The diagnosis is supported by a urine test strip which is positive for [...] "blood" [...] but the urine contains no red blood cells when examined with a microscope. Blood tests show a creatine kinase greater than 1,000 U/L, with severe disease being above 5,000 U/L.|$|E
500|$|The {{structures}} in the tracheobronchial tree are well protected, so it normally takes {{a large amount of}} force to injure them. In blunt trauma, TBI is usually the result of violent compression of the chest. Rapid hyperextension of the neck, usually resulting from vehicle crashes, can also injure the trachea, and trauma to the neck can crush the trachea against the vertebrae. A <b>crush</b> <b>injury</b> of the larynx or cervical trachea can occur in head-on collisions when the neck is hyperextended and strikes the steering wheel or dashboard; this has been called a [...] "dashboard injury". The larynx and cervical trachea may also be injured in front-on collisions by the seat belt.|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} rapid urine test for myoglobin in early detection of renal involvement in <b>crushing</b> <b>injury,</b> we underwent a prospective investigation to study a urine rapid test specific for myoglobin in the specific population. Fifty-four consecutive patients presenting with <b>crushing</b> <b>injury</b> and a serum creatine kinase (CK) of> 5000 IU/L from 1999 to 2001 have been enrolled as study population. Serum CK and its isoenzyme CK-MB, serum and urine myoglobin were also measured. A urine rapid myoglobin test was also performed as comparisons. All of the victims with <b>crushing</b> <b>injury</b> accepted standard medical and surgical treatment as indicated. The rate of renal involvement was about 56 % (30 out of 54 patients). Urine myoglobin was present in 29 of these 30 victims (97 %) with renal involvement and 2 of 24 patients (8 %) without it by the rapid urine myoglobin test. The cut-off value of positive rapid urine myoglobin test was around 50 nmol/L by the ROC analysis with the sensitivity of 98 % [95 % CI 92 - 100 %] and the specificity 86 % [95 % CI 80 - 92 %].
