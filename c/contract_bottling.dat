40|$|The UK brewing {{industry}} {{is valued at}} £ 28 bn per year and provides over 700, 000 jobs in the UK. A growing sector of this market (7 % growth p. a.) is comprised of microbrewers who brew cask ale, a product worth £ 1. 8 bn and responsible for 45, 000 jobs. There are now over 100 microbrewers in the East Midlands. In the UK, the domestic market for cask ale is extremely saturated and brewers are looking to expand their market by selling bottled beer in the same market and exporting abroad. However, bottling beer is currently extremely expensive and time consuming for microbrewers in the East Midlands region, since it is either bottled by hand or sent a considerable distance, {{as there is no}} <b>contract</b> <b>bottling</b> facility in the region. Recent research indicates that about 25 % of the regional craft brewers in the East Midlands now bottle condition beer and others have expressed an interest in doing so. However, there are no <b>contract</b> <b>bottling</b> companies that are central to the East Midlands area and so beer is transported significant distances to be bottled and returned to the production brewery for distribution. This makes the process costly and environmentally less sustainable than it could be if a local facility were available. The scope of this dissertation is to identify the optimal solution for a fleet of vehicles, which will provide a collection and delivery service of beer, from a centralised Bottling Plant. The objective is to achieve reduction in CO 2 emissions potentially generated by the introduction of a service of collection and delivery of beer from the Bottling Facilities. This dissertation explains why this problem is considered a Vehicle Routing Problem and how was resolved using the Cost Saving heuristic introduced by Clarke and Wright (1964), and later the Tabu Search metaheuristic introduced by Glover (1986). It is later explained how this heuristics were implemented using a macro in Microsoft Excel and the simulations obtained. The results show that the heuristic and metaheuristic combined generate a high quality solution, reducing considerable the CO 2 emissions projected. However, some considerations before using the tool designed must be contemplated, therefore recommendations are given in this document. Finally, guidance, for the future end-user of the software implemented, is presented and future research directions are addressed...|$|E

Legal matters were not helped by the decision of the bottlers to subcontract to other companies, effectively becoming parent bottlers. This <b>contract</b> specified that <b>bottles</b> would be sold at 5¢ each and had no fixed duration, leading to the fixed price of Coca-Cola from 1886 to 1959.|$|R

5000|$|The {{fixed price}} of Coca-Cola from 1886 to 1959 {{refers to a}} period in the United States during which the price of 6.5 oz of Coca-Cola fluctuated very little to consumers. There were many reasons for this lack of movement, {{including}} <b>bottling</b> <b>contracts</b> signed by The Coca-Cola Company in 1899, advertising, vending machine technology, and the lower rate of inflation relative to more recent times. The fixed price of Coca-Cola from 1886 to 1959 is especially significant given the potentially influential events {{that occurred during the}} same time period, including the founding of Pepsi, World War I, prohibition, changing taxes, a caffeine and caramel shortage, and World War II. Much of the research on this subject comes from [...] "The Real Thing": Nominal Price Rigidity of the Nickel Coke, 1886-1959, a 2004 paper by economists Daniel Levy and Andrew Young.|$|R
50|$|Although Candler {{predicted}} differently, bottling {{did indeed}} become popular (surpassing fountain sales in 1928), and the non-expiring contract meant that Coca-Cola {{had to sell}} their syrup for a fixed price. That meant Coca-Cola's profits could be maximized only by maximizing the amount of product sold and that meant minimizing the price to the consumer. Toward this end, Coca-Cola began an aggressive marketing campaign to associate their product with the five-cent price tag, providing incentive for retailers to sell at that price even though a higher price at a lower volume might have made them more profit otherwise. The campaign proved successful, and bottlers did not increase prices. Coca-Cola was able to renegotiate the <b>bottling</b> <b>contract</b> in 1921. However, {{in part because of}} the costs of rebranding (changing all of their advertisements as well as the psychological associations among consumers) the price of Coca-Cola remained at five cents for over three more decades.|$|R
5|$|The temperance {{movement}} {{of the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth century, and emergency laws aimed at restricting drinking during the First World War created difficult trading conditions for brewers. In 1919 net profit was reported at £22,325 (£900,000 at 2010 prices). Samuel Wentworth Webster, a director of the company and grandson of the founder, died in 1928 with a personalty of £45,000 (£2.2million in 2010). In 1928, one of the brewery's most successful beers was launched; Webster's Green Label, a light mild ale. In 1929 the company's entire stock of properties, land and brewery buildings was valued at £468,833 (£23.2million in 2010). The company took over Joseph Stocks of Halifax in December 1932, which could trace its origins back to 1790. In 1957, Webster's took over the brewer, John Ainley & Sons of Huddersfield and Woodhead Brothers of Elland, near Halifax, a mineral water manufacturer. The company dray horses, used for local beer deliveries, were retired by the end of the 1950s. In 1961 Webster's bought Daniel Fielding & Sons of Halifax, which added 19 public houses to their tied estate. The same year the company sought out partnership with the national brewer Watney Mann in order to benefit from the technical knowledge of the much larger company. In return Webster's brewed and sold the brewery conditioned Watney's Red Barrel ale throughout their tied estate. In 1962, a reciprocal trading agreement was reached with Ind Coope's North East division which saw Webster's houses stock lager for the first time. That same year the group won the <b>contract</b> to <b>bottle</b> Tuborg for West Yorkshire.|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} founded as a brewpub in Louisville, Kentucky in 1993 by chief brewer David Pierce {{and a small}} group of beer investors. In the late 1990s Pipkin Brewing Co began <b>contract</b> brewing and <b>bottling</b> BBC beers. In 2001 the BBC {{purchased}} the Pipkin Brewing Company located at 636 East Main St Louisville, KY while the brewpub continued to operate at 3929 Shelbyville Rd, both are still operating in those locations today. In 2001 the brewpub and brewery split into two separate companies with a mutual name due to irreconcilable differences between owners. The Main St brewery now packages and distributes regionally, and the brewpub packages 750ml bottles for distribution, {{but for the most part}} produces beer for the pub and a non-brewing satellite location located at 660 4th st in Louisville. The Main St location is the home of the Louisville Beer Museum and Taproom which does not offer food. Award-winning brewer Jerry Gnagy is the head brewer for the brewpub. Joel Halbleib is the Master Brewer at the production facility on Main Street. David Pierce departed the BBC in April of 09' to brew for the New Albanian Brewing Co.|$|R
