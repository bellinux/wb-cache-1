Ideally, the antennas used in these applications should be frequency-independent to avoid signal distortion.

40|$|We {{study the}} spin-Hall {{magnetoresistance}} (SMR) and spin Seebeck effect (SSE) in a noncollinear insulating magnet-Pt heterostructure. We show that SMR {{can be used}} as an all-electric probe of complex spin states exhibited by the chiral magnet, Cu 2 OSeO 3, under an applied magnetic field. The slope of the magnetic field dependence of the SMR signal changes sign at the transition between the helical and <b>conical</b> <b>spiral</b> states and shows another discontinuity when the <b>conical</b> <b>spiral</b> turns into a collinear ferromagnetic state. We demonstrate that the amplitude of the SMR signal is controlled by the cone angle theta, and that it changes sign at theta similar to 55 degrees. The angular dependence of the SMR in the multidomain helical spiral state is markedly different from the simple sinusoidal dependence observed in the monodomain <b>conical</b> <b>spiral</b> and ferromagnetic states. This complex behavior is explained {{within the framework of the}} SMR theory initially developed for collinear magnets. The SSE displays unconventional behavior where not only the magnitude but also the phase of the angular dependence of the SSE varies with the applied magnetic field...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Conical spiral antennas {{can have}} an input {{impedance}} and gain that are nearly frequency independent over a wide bandwidth. However, these antennas normally have dispersive properties that produce significant distortion when {{they are used to}} radiate a pulse. In this paper, we examine this dispersion in detail and the possibility of compensating for the dispersion so that the antenna can be used for pulse radiation. First, a simple, qualitative model for this antenna is described. This model provides physical insight into the causes for the dispersion. Next, the antenna is examined using an accurate, full electromagnetic analysis done with the finite-difference time-domain method. Results from this analysis support the conclusions reached with the simple model and provide additional insight into the dispersion. Finally, an approach for compensating for the dispersion in the antenna is described, and the interesting features of the pulse radiated from this antenna, after compensation, are discussed.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between the itinerant spins in metals and localized spins in magnetic insulators thus far has only been explored in collinear spin systems, such as garnets. Here, we report the spin-Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) sensitive to the surface magnetization of the spin-spiral material, Cu_ 2 OSeO_ 3. We experimentally demonstrate that the angular dependence of the SMR changes drastically at the transition between the helical <b>spiral</b> and the <b>conical</b> <b>spiral</b> phases. Furthermore, the sign and magnitude of the SMR in the <b>conical</b> <b>spiral</b> state are controlled by the cone angle. We show that this complex behaviour can be qualitatively explained within the SMR theory initially developed for collinear magnets. In addition, we studied the spin Seebeck effect (SSE), which is sensitive to the bulk magnetization. It originates from the conversion of thermally excited low-energy spin waves in the magnet, known as magnons, into the spin current in the adjacent metal contact (Pt). The SSE displays unconventional behavior where not only the magnitude but also the phase of the SSE vary with the applied magnetic field...|$|R

3000|$|With {{respect to}} the heat {{transfer}} performance and pressure drop required in the system, the [...] "Figure of Merit" [...] concept is introduced {{as a measure of}} the heat transferred per unit pumping power (see Equation 14 for details). Figure 12 c presents the computed figures of merit for various tube geometries, nanofluid concentrations and nanofluid types. It is found that apart from the higher heat transfer rate, the coiled tubes have lower figures of merit than those of the straight tube. This {{can be explained by the}} higher pressure drops required in the coiled systems (see Figure 12 b). Among all coiled tubes tested, the <b>conical</b> <b>spiral</b> tube gives the highest figure of merit, followed by in-plane <b>spiral</b> and <b>conical</b> <b>spiral</b> tubes. Furthermore, for the straight tube, the addition of nanoparticles improves the figure of merit significantly, albeit it decreases with increasing concentration. For coiled tubes filled with nanofluids, on the other hand, the improvement of figure of merit is only shown at low particle concentration of 1 % and then it drops lower than that of water when more nanoparticles are added. Clearly, these results suggest that one can add nanoparticle up to 1 % volumetric concentration to water to enhance heat transfer performance in coiled tubes; higher nanoparticle concentrations are not recommended.|$|R

Furthermore, Al 2 O 3 nanofluid gives slightly better heat transfer performance than CuO nanofluid in coiled tubes.

The second unit is a planar spiral antenna; it generates directional beams by a summation of the azimuthal modes.
