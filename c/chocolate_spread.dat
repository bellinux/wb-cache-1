25|$|Over a 100-year period {{since its}} first {{appearance}} in the ports of Andalusia, chocolate became popular as a drink in Spain, where it was served to the Spanish monarchy.

2500|$|Brussels waffles are {{prepared}} with an egg-white-leavened or yeast-leavened batter, traditionally an ale yeast; occasionally {{both types of}} leavening are used together. They are lighter, crisper and have larger pockets compared to other European waffle varieties, and are easy to differentiate from Liège Waffles by their rectangular sides. In Belgium, most waffles are served warm by street vendors and dusted with confectioner's sugar, though in tourist areas they might be topped with whipped cream, soft fruit or <b>chocolate</b> <b>spread.</b> Variants of the Brussels waffles – with whipped and folded egg whites cooked in large rectangular forms – date from the 18th century. However, the oldest recognized reference to [...] "Gaufres de Bruxelles" [...] (Brussels Waffles) by name is attributed from 1842/43 to Florian Dacher, a Swiss baker in Ghent, Belgium, who had previously worked under pastry chefs in central Brussels. Philippe Cauderlier would later publish Dacher's recipe in the 1874 edition of his recipe book [...] "La Pâtisserie et la Confiture". Maximilien Consael, another Ghent chef, had claimed to have invented the waffles in 1839, though there's no written record of him either naming or selling the waffles until his participation in the 1856 Brussels Fair. It {{should be noted that}} neither man created the recipe; they simply popularized and formalized an existing recipe as the Brussels waffle.|$|E

Marmalade/jams or even <b>chocolate</b> <b>spreads</b> are also common on bread or toast. Today cereal bars are also becoming a common type of breakfast on the island. The traditional English breakfast of eggs, sausages and fried bacon was also popular among the Maltese, especially on Sundays, due to the strong British influence on the island but this has diminished almost completely, as locals have rediscovered a more Mediterranean and continental diet over the recent years. Hotels usually serve both a continental as well as a full English breakfast. Prayers are often said before breakfast in order to bless the meal.|$|R

40|$|According {{to recent}} {{research}} {{it can be}} assumed that expenditures for organic food in families with children are declining as children get older. For organic food marketing this raises the question which kind of changes in families’ organic food consumption appear over time and why they appear. For this purpose qualitative interviews with juveniles and parents were conducted and phenomenon-based relationship models designed. The phenomenon „parent’s dealing with changed food preferences of juvenile children“, which is presented here, provides an insight into juveniles’ demands regarding organic food products and parents’ strategies and actions to deal with these. Thereby sweets, salty food snacks and <b>chocolate</b> <b>spreads</b> {{turn out to be}} organic food products mainly rejected by juveniles. As main reason for rejection the criteria of taste can be identified. Dealing with their children’s preferences, parents follow the two strategies „making concessions“ and „not making concessions“. Product type, product attributes, consumption situation and price emerge as subjectively meaningful conditions for the interviewed parents. According to the results, marketing strategies for the organic food products concerned should mainly be targeted to juveniles’ demands on taste {{on the one hand and}} parents’ demands on ingredients on the other...|$|R

40|$|Sugar and {{sweetened}} beverages {{are increasingly}} {{present in the}} nutrition of adolescents. Sugars added to food usually do not contain essential nutrients and inhibit the consumption of nutritionally rich foods. The aim of this diploma thesis is {{to determine how much}} sugar is present in the diets of adolescents, how and when most frequently adolescents eat sugar and whether the consumption of sweet foods among adolescents vary according to gender, age, and body weight. Data were collected using a questionnaire that was returned by 210 freshman and junior secondary school students attending Education Centre Novo mesto. The results showed that adolescents frequently consume chocolate, cookies, and <b>chocolate</b> <b>spreads.</b> One quarter of the respondents consumed these food types 5 to 6 times or more a week. Year of education and gender did not affect the frequency of eating sweets. However, gender revealed differences in the frequency of consumption of carbonated soft drinks and iced-tea. Adolescents consumed tea with sugar more often than tea without sugar. From sweetened beverages adolescents most often drank flavoured water. Flavoured water also was the drink that adolescents bought most frequently by themselves. Among adolescents with normal weight and those that were overweight, there were no differences in the frequency of consumption of sugary foods. Most often, the respondents consumed sugary foods at special occasions and at home. Boys, unlike girls drank more fluids per day, and they also drank more sweetened beverages. Quantity of fluid with added sugar represented half of the drinks they had during the day. Foods with high sugar content are commonly found in the diets of adolescents. To achieve dietary recommendations among adolescents, we have to inform young people about the effects of food and sweetened beverages on their health and we have to ensure adequate availability and accessibility of healthy foods. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{food consumption}} {{in relation to}} clustered cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Methods: Children (n= 5548, 51. 6 % boys) from eight European countries participated in the IDEFICS study baseline survey (20072008). Z-scores of individual CVD risk factors were summed to compute sex- and age-specific (2 < 6 years/ 69 years) clustered CVD risk scores A (all components, except cardiorespiratory fitness) and B (all components). The association of clustered CVD risk and tertiles of food group consumption was examined. Results: Odds ratio (OR) of having clustered CVD risk A increased in older children with higher consumption of <b>chocolate</b> and nut-based <b>spreads</b> (boys: OR= 0. 46; 95 % CI= 0. 320. 69; girls: OR= 0. 60; 95 % CI= 0. 420. 86), jam and honey (girls: OR= 0. 45; 95 % CI= 0. 260. 78) and sweets (boys: OR= 0. 69; 95 % CI= 0. 480. 98). OR of being at risk significantly increased with the highest consumption of soft drinks (younger boys) and manufactured juices (older girls). Concerning CVD risk score B, older {{boys and girls in}} the highest tertile of consumption of breakfast cereals were 0. 41 (95 % CI= 0. 210. 79) and 0. 45 (95 % CI= 0. 220. 93) times, respectively, less likely to be at risk than those in tertile 1. Conclusions: High consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and low intake of breakfast cereals, jam and honey, sweets and <b>chocolate</b> and nut-based <b>spreads</b> seem to adversely affect clustered CVD risk...|$|R
