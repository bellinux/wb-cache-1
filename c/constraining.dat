Theoretically, all five can decay into isotopes of element 72 (hafnium) by alpha emission, but only 180W has been observed to do so with a half-life of (1.8 ± 0.2)×1018 years; on average, this yields about two alpha decays of 180W in one gram of natural tungsten per year. The other naturally occurring isotopes have not been observed to decay, <b>constraining</b> their half-lives to be at least 4×1021 years.|$|E

40|$|In a <b>constrained</b> {{pseudorandom}} function (PRF), {{the holder}} {{of the master}} secret key can derive <b>constrained</b> keys {{with respect to a}} boolean circuit C. The <b>constrained</b> key can be used to evaluate the PRF on all inputs x for which C(x) = 1. In almost all existing constructions of <b>constrained</b> PRFs, the <b>constrained</b> key itself reveals its constraints. We introduce the concept of private <b>constrained</b> PRFs, which are <b>constrained</b> PRFs with the additional property that the <b>constrained</b> keys do not reveal their constraints. Our main notion of privacy captures the intuition that an adversary, given a <b>constrained</b> key for one of two circuits C 0 and C 1, is unable to tell which circuit is associated with its key. As a primitive, private <b>constrained</b> PRFs have many natural applications in searchable symmetric encryption, deniable encryption, and more. We then show how to instantiate private <b>constrained</b> PRFs. Our first construction uses indistinguishability obfuscation and achieves our strongest notions of functionality and privacy. We also give two constructions based on concrete assumptions on multilinear maps which achieve slightly weaker notions of privacy and for more limited classes of constraints: namely, for the class of bit-fixing constraints and puncturing constraints. ...|$|R
