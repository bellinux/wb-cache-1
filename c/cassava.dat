5|$|<b>Cassava</b> {{chips are}} a common food in much of Africa, {{including}} the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana and Malawi. In Ghana, <b>cassava</b> chips are called konkonte. Dried <b>cassava</b> chips are also used to supplement the carbohydrate content of livestock feed in Ghana. In Malawi, <b>cassava</b> chips are prepared by soaking <b>cassava,</b> slicing it, and then letting it dry. This is the primary means by which <b>cassava</b> is transported to markets from production areas.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to prepared <b>cassava</b> chips from thinly sliced raw <b>cassava</b> root that is then immediately fried or deep-fried, chips may be prepared in a multi-stage process, {{starting with a}} dough made from <b>cassava</b> flour. The dough is steamed, thinly sliced, dried, and then fried in oil. This style of <b>cassava</b> flour chips is a popular food in India, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.|$|E
5|$|Reports from Burundi and Angola warn of {{a threat}} to food {{security}} caused by the African <b>Cassava</b> Mosaic Virus (ACMD). ACMD is responsible for the loss of a million tons of <b>cassava</b> each year. CMD is prevalent in all the main cassava-growing areas in the Great Lakes region of east Africa, causing between 20 and 90 percent crop losses in the Congo. The FAO emergency relief and rehabilitation program is assisting vulnerable returnee populations in the African Great Lakes Region through mass propagation and distribution of CMD resistant or highly tolerant <b>cassava.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Africa, where batik was {{originally}} imported by Dutch merchants from Indonesia (then the Netherlands East Indies), paste made from starch or mud {{is used as}} a resist instead of wax. The most developed resist-dyeing skills {{are to be found in}} Nigeria where the Yoruba make adire cloths. Two methods of resist are used: adire eleso which involves tied and stitched designs and adire eleko that uses starch paste. The paste is most often made from <b>cassava</b> starch, rice, and other ingredients boiled together to produce a smooth thick paste. The Yoruba of West Africa use <b>cassava</b> paste as a resist while the Soninke and Wolof people in Senegal uses rice paste. The Bamana people of Mali use mud as a resist.|$|E
5|$|Banton has a {{primarily}} agricultural economy, with copra {{farming and}} fishing {{as the main}} sources of livelihood. There is also an indigenous raffia palm handicraft industry. Other crops grown in the island are root crops (such as <b>cassava,</b> sweet potatoes), fruits and vegetables. The locals also engage in livestock raising for local consumption, and small-scale shipbuilding of wooden boats and launches.|$|E
5|$|Cowpeas {{thrive in}} poor dry conditions, growing well in soils up to 85% sand. This makes them a {{particularly}} important crop in arid, semi-desert regions where not many other crops will grow. As {{well as an}} important source of food for humans in poor arid regions the crop can also be used as feed for livestock. Its nitrogen fixing ability means that as well as functioning as a sole-crop, the cowpea can be effectively intercropped with sorghum, millet, maize, <b>cassava</b> or cotton.|$|E
5|$|Cuisine {{varies by}} region, but a large, one-course, evening meal is common {{throughout}} the country. A typical dish {{is based on}} cocoyams, maize, <b>cassava</b> (manioc), millet, plantains, potatoes, rice, or yams, often pounded into dough-like fufu. This is served with a sauce, soup, or stew made from greens, groundnuts, palm oil, or other ingredients. Meat and fish are popular but expensive additions, with chicken often reserved for special occasions. Dishes are often quite hot, spiced with salt, red pepper sauce, and Maggi.|$|E
5|$|However, {{vegetables}} often {{also contain}} toxins and antinutrients which {{interfere with the}} absorption of nutrients. These include α-solanine, α-chaconine, enzyme inhibitors (of cholinesterase, protease, amylase, etc.), cyanide and cyanide precursors, oxalic acid, and others. These toxins are natural defenses, used {{to ward off the}} insects, predators and fungi that might attack the plant. Some beans contain phytohaemagglutinin, and <b>cassava</b> roots contain cyanogenic glycoside as do bamboo shoots. These toxins can be deactivated by adequate cooking. Green potatoes contain glycoalkaloids and should be avoided.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the pessimistic view of the south taken by the Khartoum administration, he was enthusiastic about the wealth and diversity of plants. He noted that the people had adapted to cultivating non-native plants such as <b>cassava,</b> maize, sweet potato and groundnuts. He {{also noted that the}} government was restricting commercial development of sugarcane, tobacco and coffee, which grew wild, and thus preventing economic development.|$|E
5|$|The cuisine of Rwanda {{is based}} on local staple foods {{produced}} by subsistence agriculture such as bananas, plantains (known as ibitoke), pulses, sweet potatoes, beans, and <b>cassava</b> (manioc). Many Rwandans do not eat meat {{more than a few}} times a month. For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, tilapia is popular. The potato, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian colonialists, is very popular. Ubugari (or umutsima) is a paste made from <b>cassava</b> or maize and water to form a porridge-like consistency that is eaten throughout the African Great Lakes. Isombe is made from mashed <b>cassava</b> leaves and served with dried fish. Lunch is usually a buffet known as mélange, consisting of the above staples and sometimes meat. Brochettes are the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat but sometimes tripe, beef, or fish. In rural areas, many bars have a brochette seller responsible for tending and slaughtering the goats, skewering and barbecuing the meat, and serving it with grilled bananas. Milk, particularly in a fermented yoghurt form called ikivuguto, is a common drink throughout the country. Other drinks include a traditional beer called urwagwa, made from sorghum or bananas, which features in traditional rituals and ceremonies. The major drinks manufacturer in Rwanda is Bralirwa, which was established in the 1950s and is now listed on the Rwandan Stock Exchange. Bralirwa manufactures soft drink products from The Coca-Cola Company, under license, including Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite, and a range of beers including Primus, Mützig, Amstel, and Turbo King. In 2009 a new brewery, Brasseries des Mille Collines (BMC) opened, manufacturing Skol beer and a local version known as Skol Gatanu; BMC is now owned by Belgian company Unibra. East African Breweries also operate in the country, importing Guinness, Tusker, and Bell, as well as whisky and spirits.|$|E
5|$|After 1492, {{a global}} {{exchange}} of previously local {{crops and livestock}} breeds occurred. Maize, potatoes, sweet potatoes and manioc were the key crops that spread from the New World to the Old, while varieties of wheat, barley, rice and turnips traveled from the Old World to the New. There had been few livestock species in the New World, with horses, cattle, sheep and goats being completely unknown before their arrival with Old World settlers. Crops moving in both directions across the Atlantic Ocean caused population growth {{around the world and}} a lasting effect on many cultures. Maize and <b>cassava</b> were introduced from Brazil into Africa by Portuguese traders in the 16th century, becoming staple foods, replacing native African crops.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{depend on}} plants for food, either {{directly}} or as feed for domestic animals. Agriculture deals with the production of food crops, and has {{played a key role}} in the history of world civilizations. Agriculture includes agronomy for arable crops, horticulture for vegetables and fruit, and forestry for timber. About 7,000 species of plant have been used for food, though most of today's food is derived from only 30 species. The major staples include cereals such as rice and wheat, starchy roots and tubers such as <b>cassava</b> and potato, and legumes such as peas and beans. Vegetable oils such as olive oil provide lipids, while fruit and vegetables contribute vitamins and minerals to the diet.|$|E
5|$|Kitti's hog-nosed bat has a brief {{activity}} period, leaving its roost {{for only}} 30 {{minutes in the}} evening and 20 minutes at dawn. These short flights are easily interrupted by heavy rain or cold temperatures. During this period, the bat forages within fields of <b>cassava</b> and kapok or around the tops of bamboo clumps and teak trees, within one kilometre of the roosting site. The wings seem to be shaped for hovering flight, and the gut contents of specimens include spiders and insects that are presumably gleaned off foliage. Nevertheless, most prey is probably caught in flight. Main staples of the bat's diet include small flies (Chloropidae, Agromyzidae, and Anthomyiidae), hymenopterans, and psocopterans.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{provide the}} greater part of food for humans, and for their {{domestic}} animals. They have {{played a key role in}} the history of world civilizations.

About 7,000 species of plant have been used for food, though most of today's food is derived from only 30 species. The major staples include cereals such as rice and wheat, starchy roots and tubers such as <b>cassava</b> and potato, and legumes such as peas and beans. Vegetable oils such as olive oil provide lipids, while fruit and vegetables contribute vitamins and minerals to the diet.|$|E
5|$|RNAi {{has been}} used to genetically {{engineer}} plants to produce lower levels of natural plant toxins. Such techniques take advantage of the stable and heritable RNAi phenotype in plant stocks. Cotton seeds are rich in dietary protein but naturally contain the toxic terpenoid product gossypol, making them unsuitable for human consumption. RNAi {{has been used}} to produce cotton stocks whose seeds contain reduced levels of delta-cadinene synthase, a key enzyme in gossypol production, without affecting the enzyme's production {{in other parts of the}} plant, where gossypol is itself important in preventing damage from plant pests. Similar efforts have been directed toward the reduction of the cyanogenic natural product linamarin in <b>cassava</b> plants.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{ingredients}} of beer are water; a starch source, such as malted barley, {{able to be}} saccharified (converted to sugars) then fermented (converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide); a brewer's yeast to produce the fermentation; and a flavouring such as hops. A mixture of starch sources may be used, with a secondary starch source, such as maize (corn), rice or sugar, often being termed an adjunct, especially when used as a lower-cost substitute for malted barley. Less widely used starch sources include millet, sorghum and <b>cassava</b> root in Africa, and potato in Brazil, and agave in Mexico, among others. The amount of each starch source in a beer recipe is collectively called the grain bill.|$|E
5|$|The former Eastern Region {{was once}} famed for {{producing}} half the world's total output of palm kernels. Since the Nigerian Civil War production has markedly declined {{largely because the}} plantations and processing equipment were either damaged or destroyed. The production of other important cash crops such as cocoa, groundnut and groundnut oil, rubber, <b>cassava,</b> cotton and cotton seed and timber tumbled {{after the civil war}} and the subsequent oil boom years. Consequently, the area called Enugu State as well as the rest of Nigeria, which was once a self-sufficient net exporter in agricultural produce, must import food.|$|E
5|$|Wax {{resist dyeing}} of fabric {{is an ancient}} art form. It already existed in Egypt in the 4th century BC, where {{it was used to}} wrap mummies; linen was soaked in wax, and {{scratched}} using a stylus. In Asia, the technique was practised in China during the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD), and in India and Japan during the Nara Period (645-794 AD). In Africa it was originally practised by the Yoruba tribe in Nigeria, Soninke and Wolof in Senegal. These African version however, uses <b>cassava</b> starch or rice paste, or mud as a resist instead of beeswax.|$|E
5|$|Diego Velázquez, the {{governor}} of Cuba, was enthused by Hernández de Córdoba's report of gold in Yucatán. He organised a new expedition consisting of four ships and 260 men. He placed his nephew Juan de Grijalva in command. Francisco de Montejo, who would eventually conquer much of the peninsula, was captain {{of one of the}} ships,; Pedro de Alvarado and Alonso d'Avila captained the other ships. Bernal Díaz del Castillo served on the crew; he was able to secure a place on the expedition as a favour from {{the governor}}, who was his kinsman. Antón de Alaminos once again served as pilot. Governor Velázquez provided all four ships, in an attempt to protect his claim over the peninsula. The small fleet was stocked with crossbows, muskets, barter goods, salted pork and <b>cassava</b> bread. Grijalva also took one of the captured Indians from the Hernández expedition.|$|E
5|$|Khmer Loeu diets in Ratanakiri {{are largely}} {{dictated}} by the food that is available for harvesting or gathering. Numerous food taboos also limit food choice, particularly among pregnant women, children, and the sick. The primary staple grain is rice, though most families experience rice shortages during the six months before harvest time. Some families have begun to plant maize to alleviate this problem; other sources of grain include potatoes, <b>cassava,</b> and taro. Most Khmer Loeu diets are low in protein, which is limited in availability. Wild game and fish are major protein sources, and smaller animals such as rats, wild chickens, and insects are also sometimes eaten. Domestic animals such as pigs, cows, and buffaloes are only eaten when sacrifices are made. In the rainy season, many varieties of vegetables and leaves are gathered from the forest. (Vegetables are generally not cultivated.) Commonly eaten fruits include bananas, jackfruit, papayas, and mangoes.|$|E
5|$|Msambweni {{grew from}} a small village into a bustling little town. Fishing is {{important}} to the local community of Msambweni and is the primary source of income. The area is mainly Muslim and inhabited by Digo peoples. The Kwake District Development Plan 2002–2008 attempted to improve fish landing sites and beach access for fisherman on the coast of Msambweni. Coconut palm is grown, as are cashew nuts, fruits and buxa coloring. Maize, <b>cassava,</b> cowpeas and rice are grown for domestic consumption. There are numerous stalls along the main road in the town selling fruit and vegetables. Silica sand is mined at Msambweni and transported to Nairobi to make bottle glass. Beekeeping and seaweed farming are also local occupation and its commercialization in the area has been supported by ACT! Kenya with financial assistance from the European Union.|$|E
5|$|Subsistence crops {{grown in}} the country include matoke (green bananas), which occupy {{more than a third}} of the country's farmland, potatoes, beans, sweet potatoes, <b>cassava,</b> wheat and maize. Coffee and tea are the major cash crops for export, with the high altitudes, steep slopes and {{volcanic}} soils providing favourable conditions. Reports, have established that more than 400,000 Rwandans, make their living from coffee plantation. Reliance on agricultural exports makes Rwanda vulnerable to shifts in their prices. Animals raised in Rwanda include cows, goats, sheep, pigs, chicken, and rabbits, with geographical variation in the numbers of each. Production systems are mostly traditional, although there are a few intensive dairy farms around Kigali. Shortages of land and water, insufficient and poor-quality feed, and regular disease epidemics with insufficient veterinary services are major constraints that restrict output. Fishing takes place on the country's lakes, but stocks are very depleted, and live fish are being imported in an attempt to revive the industry.|$|E
5|$|The {{advent of}} the trans-Atlantic slave trade {{increased}} maritime trade at Malagasy ports, including food products. In 1696, a trading vessel {{en route to the}} American colonies reportedly took a stock of local Malagasy rice to Charleston, South Carolina, where the grain formed the basis of the plantation industry. Trading ships brought crops from the Americas—such as sweet potato, tomato, maize, peanuts, tobacco and lima beans—to Madagascar in the 16th and 17thcenturies; <b>cassava</b> arrived after 1735 from a French colony at nearby Réunion Island. These products were first cultivated in coastal areas nearest to their ports of arrival, but soon spread throughout the island; within 100years of their introduction they were widespread throughout the central highlands. Similarly, pineapple and citrus fruits such as lemons, limes, oranges, consumed by sailors to ward off scurvy on long cross-Atlantic trips, were introduced at coastal Malagasy ports. Local cultivation began soon afterward.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Imerina was governed through {{a mixture of}} traditional practices and innovative measures. While all land technically belonged to the sovereign, its administration {{was carried out by}} andriana who were assigned a menakely (subdivision of land) to govern. These administrators were themselves overseen by roving royal advisers. The land was cultivated by commoners, who were given a parcel to farm based {{on the size of the}} family it was meant to feed, and each family paid taxes to the king in return. Andrianampoinimerina passed laws giving children the right to claim meat from the butcher that had not been sold by the day's end, and allowing the poor to eat <b>cassava</b> from others' fields, provided they took only what they could cook and consume on the spot. In this way, the basic nutritional needs of most citizens were met.|$|E
5|$|Upon making {{landfall}} in Nicaragua, Bret caused severe flooding {{along the}} coast that left 25villages isolated. Rains continued following the storm, preventing areas from being reached, and Tropical Storm Gert brought additional rainfall to the area in early September. Throughout Nicaragua, Bret destroyed 12bridges and disrupted the drainage systems along the regional road network. Heavy rainfall also caused rivers to overflow, causing heavy damage in adjacent fields that affected rice, <b>cassava,</b> and bananas; about 1,800hectares (4,500acres) of rice fields were destroyed. Two villages of the Miskito people were washed away, leaving 500residents homeless. The storm damaged at least 1,500houses and destroyed another 850, leaving around 60,000people temporarily homeless. Bret also destroyed ten churches and ten schools, as well as 25medical centers. The storm killed nine people offshore when a boat sank in the Corn Islands, and there were 31deaths overall in the country. The preliminary damage total was around US$3million, although it did not include crop or infrastructure damage.|$|E
5|$|Termites can {{be major}} {{agricultural}} pests, particularly in East Africa and North Asia, where crop losses can be severe (3–100% in crop loss in Africa). Counterbalancing {{this is the}} greatly improved water infiltration where termite tunnels in the soil allow rainwater to soak in deeply, which helps reduce runoff and consequent soil erosion through bioturbation. In South America, cultivated plants such as eucalyptus, upland rice and sugarcane can be severely damaged by termite infestations, with attacks on leaves, roots and woody tissue. Termites can also attack other plants, including <b>cassava,</b> coffee, cotton, fruit trees, maize, peanuts, soybeans and vegetables. Mounds can disrupt farming activities, {{making it difficult for}} farmers to operate farming machinery; however, despite farmers' dislike of the mounds, it is often the case that no net loss of production occurs. Termites can be beneficial to agriculture, such as by boosting crop yields and enriching the soil. Termites and ants can re-colonise untilled land that contains crop stubble, which colonies use for nourishment when they establish their nests. The presence of nests in fields enables larger amounts of rainwater to soak into the ground and increases the amount of nitrogen in the soil, both essential for the growth of crops.|$|E
5|$|The Congo Free State was a {{corporate}} state in Central Africa privately owned by King Leopold II of Belgium founded and recognised by the Berlin Conference of 1885. What {{would later become}} Abir Company territory was the land between the Lopori and Maringa river basins, tributaries of the Congo River, {{in the north of}} the state. The local populace here were yam and <b>cassava</b> farmers who engaged in trade with river fishermen and pygmy hunters. In 1885 a force of the Manyema people, followers of Tippu Tip, the Swahili-Zanzibari slave trader, arrived {{at the head of the}} Lopori River from Stanley Falls. They took hostages from nearby villages to ransom in return for ivory. By 1892 they had enrolled local people into their army and controlled the entire eastern half of the basin. The Free State was concerned by this development and in 1889 had enacted the Monopoly Act which declared that all products in the area were to be under their jurisdiction alone. The Free State also began a campaign to drive the slavers, traders and the Manyema from the region, the first stage of which was the establishment of a supply post at Basankusu in May 1890. The campaign would be long but eventually successful and the entire basin was under Free State control by 1898.|$|E
25|$|The <b>cassava</b> mosaic virus (CMV) {{is another}} <b>cassava</b> virus that {{exhibits}} foliar symptoms similar to CBSD, {{but they are}} more obvious.|$|E
25|$|Widely {{grown in}} this area, <b>cassava</b> is {{typically}} {{included in the}} region's dishes, as are other components of meals, such as the chipá (a <b>cassava</b> and cheese bread). However, in this area <b>Cassava</b> is cooked alone too, boiled or fried, often {{as a side dish}} for asado and empanadas. Sopa Paraguaya and Chipá Guazu (also called Tarta de Choclo) are also commonly eaten and are made with corn. Chipá from <b>Cassava</b> is often eaten during breakfast with yerba mate, prepared with hot water, or with café con leche. Sopa Paraguaya and Tarta de Choclo are eaten for lunch or dinner. As regards to products made with sugar, Papaya (mamón in Argentine Spanish) jam is typical of the province of Corrientes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cassava</b> is {{the only}} year-round staple.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cassava</b> (yuca), which {{originated}} in South America and the Caribbean, is the staple food in Basankusu. The roots are made into <b>cassava</b> bread, known as kwanga, and other cassava-based dishes. The leaves {{are also used}} as a green vegetable and are compared to spinach for taste and texture.|$|E
25|$|The {{marketplace}} {{is a place}} for buying and selling locally grown foods and also foodstuffs from further afield, which have come up the river from centres of import, such as Kinshasa. Bananas, palm nuts, onions, <b>cassava,</b> and <b>cassava</b> leaves are sold — as well as some seasonal extras such as the savoury African plum (safu) and caterpillars (mbinzo) (similar to the Mopane worms of Zimbabwe). Bread, produced in cottage bakeries, is available, as is locally grown and imported rice, although neither of these products is comparable to <b>cassava</b> in popularity.|$|E
25|$|A typical meal {{consists}} {{mostly of}} rice and beans with beef, salad, french fries and a fried egg. Often, it's mixed with <b>cassava</b> flour (farofa). Fried potatoes, fried <b>cassava,</b> fried banana, fried meat and fried cheese are very often eaten in lunch and served in most typical restaurants. Popular snacks are pastel (a fried pastry); coxinha (a variation of chicken croquete); pão de queijo (cheese bread and <b>cassava</b> flour / tapioca); pamonha (corn and milk paste); esfirra (a variation of Lebanese pastry); kibbeh (from Arabic cuisine); empanada (pastry) and empada, little salt pies filled with shrimps or heart of palm.|$|E
25|$|The Bobó de camarão is a dish {{made with}} <b>cassava</b> and shrimp (camarão).|$|E
