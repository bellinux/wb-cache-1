The only 17th century calculating clocks that have survived to this day {{do not have a}} machine wide carry mechanism and therefore cannot be called fully effective mechanical calculators. A much more successful calculating clock was built by the Italian Giovanni Poleni in the 18th century and was a two-motion calculating clock (the numbers are inscribed first and then they are processed).|$|E

2500|$|Synchronous {{dynamic random-access memory}} (SDRAM) is any dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) {{where the}} {{operation}} of its external pin interface is coordinated by an externally supplied clock signal. DRAM integrated circuits (ICs) produced from the early 1970s to mid-1990s used an asynchronous interface, in which input control signals have a direct effect on internal functions only delayed by the trip across its semiconductor pathways. SDRAM has a synchronous interface, whereby changes on control inputs are recognised after a rising edge of its <b>clock</b> <b>input.</b> [...] In SDRAM families standardized by JEDEC, the clock signal controls the stepping of an internal finite state machine that responds to incoming commands. These commands can be pipelined to improve performance, with previously started operations completing while new commands are received. The memory is divided into several equally sized but independent sections called banks, allowing the device to operate on a memory access commands in each bank simultaneously and speed access in an interleaved fashion. [...] This allows SDRAMs to achieve greater concurrency and higher data transfer rates than asynchronous DRAMs could.|$|E

40|$|The NB 100 EP 223 {{is a low}} skew 1 −to− 22 {{differential}} clock driver, {{designed with}} clock distribution in mind, accepting two clock sources into an input multiplexer. The part is designed for use in low voltage applications which require {{a large number of}} outputs to drive precisely aligned low skew signals to their destination. The two <b>clock</b> <b>inputs</b> are differential HSTL or LVPECL and they are selected by the CLK_SEL pin which is LVTTL. To avoid generation of a runt clock pulse when the device is enabled/disabled, the Output Enable (OE), which is LVTTL, is synchronous ensuring the outputs will only be enabled/disabled when they are already in LOW state (See Figure 7). The NB 100 EP 223 guarantees low output−to−output skew. The optimal design, layout, and processing minimize skew within a device and from lot to lot. In any differential output pair, the same bias and termination scheme is required. Unused output pairs should be left unterminated (open) to “reduce power and switching noise as much as possible. ” Any unused single line of a differential pair should be terminated the same as the used line to maintain balanced loads on the differential driver outputs.
