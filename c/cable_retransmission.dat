50|$|The {{main effect}} of the Directive is to {{stipulate}} that <b>cable</b> <b>retransmission</b> must be {{on the basis of}} contractual, not statutory, licences with copyright holders, although existing statutory licence schemes were permitted to remain in force until the end of 1997 (Art. 8). These licences may only be granted or refused by collecting societies 9(1), which effectively makes such societies compulsory: a collecting society may be deemed to be mandated to manage the <b>cable</b> <b>retransmission</b> rights of a copyright holder {{in the absence of any}} expressive agreement 9(2). Broadcasting organisations are free to exercise their own related rights to licence or prohibit the <b>cable</b> <b>retransmission</b> of their own broadcasts (Art. 10). The Directive also provides for mediation in disputes between cable operators and collecting societies (Art. 11) and for measures to prevent abuse of monopoly powers (Art. 12).|$|E
50|$|Council Directive 93/83/EEC of 27 September 1993 on the {{coordination}} of certain rules concerning copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and <b>cable</b> <b>retransmission</b> is a European Union directive which governs the application of copyright and related rights to satellite and cable television in the European Union. It was made under the internal market provisions of the Treaty of Rome.|$|E
50|$|SIAE {{exercises}} the author's {{right on}} behalf of their legitimate owners. Authors' right has two distinct components: economic and moral. Italian law does not require a deposit since Berne Convention provides that the rights are first acquired upon creation of the work and therefore it is possible to prove the ownership by other means such as Copyzero. According to Article 180 bis, subscription is mandatory only for <b>cable</b> <b>retransmission</b> (not such a widespread technology in Italy), while broadcasting, both via radio and television, is not included.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the legislative and economic history of the retransmission consent provision in the 1992 <b>Cable</b> Act. <b>Retransmission</b> consent provisions in the 1992 Cable Act allow broadcasters {{to enter into negotiations}} with <b>cable</b> operators regarding <b>retransmission</b> of their broadcast signal. The 1992 Cable Act requires broadcasters to choose between retransmission consent and must-carry provisions every three years. The first election period ended in October 1996 and a new election period begins January 1, 1997. Retransmission consent has had a noticeable effect on the evolution of cable television broadcasting, although it is arguably unclear whether retransmission consent has addressed the issues its proponents claimed it would address...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} answer one central question: do the US <b>cable</b> and {{satellite}} <b>retransmission</b> statutory licences {{comply with the}} TRIPS minimum standard? When solving a legal problem, law is applied {{to a set of}} given facts to yield an outcome. In solving the legal problem set out above, the "Iaw" is provided by TRIPS, in particular the incorporated article 11 bis from the Berne Convention. It provides that national Iaw must recognise in copyright owners an exclusive right to authorise the retransmission of works included in broadcasts, when a party other than the original broadcaster does the retransmission. However, it also permits that exclusive right to be limited (such as by a statutory licence) so long as copyright owners are at least assured of a right to "equitable remuneration". The "facts" are the US <b>cable</b> and satellite <b>retransmission</b> satellite licences themselves, which are found in sections 111, 119 and 122 of the US Copyright Act 1976. The "outcome" to the problem is a conclusion whether these provisions comply with or violate TRIPS. As with most legal problem solving, the resolution of ambiguity provides the challenge. In this regard, by far the greatest challenge is created by {{the use of the term}} "equitable remuneration" in Berne article 11 bis. Resort will be had to not only the drafting history of the Berne Convention, but also to the discipline of economics and to the field of restitutionary monetary awards in common Iaw countries, to seek to provide a meaning for that term. Another ambiguity relates to the very nature of the retransmission right, in particular, whether the right includes retransmissions to members of the public for which the primary broadcast was intended. Reference will be made to the provision's drafting history to seek to clarify this matter. Further ambiguity arises in the relationship between Berne article 11 bis and TRIPS article 13, the latter which makes the general "three-step test" applicable to copyright "limitations or exceptions" to exclusive rights under TRIPS. Finally, the US retransmission statutory licences themselves are arcane and present challenges to an understanding of both their provenance and their current operation. In order to apply the international retransmission copyright norm to the US requires a detailed exposition of these statutory licences.

5000|$|In May 2009, NBC {{rolled out}} a tiered {{affiliation}} plan. The plan has three levels: Bronze, Silver and Gold. Bronze {{is the standard}} existing short term affiliation, programming with ad inventory splits. With the silver plan, the affiliate and network would add working in other media: internet, wireless and video on demand areas with inventory splits, a different financial arrangement and promotion commitments. Gold affiliation agreement is a longer broader partnership in local online media and mobile digital TV with the network representing the gold affiliates in <b>cable</b> and satellite <b>retransmission</b> consent negotiations with the network sharing in the carriage revenue. An NBClocal.com livestyle website would {{be a part of}} the silver package. [...] By July 2009, GE has been registering NBCmarket.com domains (like NBCIndianapolis.com) in markets where NBC stations are not NBC owned. NBC Affiliates Board chair Mike Fiorile indicated a preference on behalf of local stations that the local station should own its own brand in the market. [...] Local Newser indicated that this might be attempt by NBC to compete with their local affiliates despite pointing out the NBC local program as a part of its top tier affiliation plans.|$|R
5000|$|On December 3, 2011, another online {{petition}} explicitly {{called for}} the elimination of Article 13c—the so-called GEMA-Vorbehalt (GEMA Clause)—of the Urheberrechtswahrnehmungsgesetz (Law concerning the exercise of authors' rights). This section of the law contains a full power of attorney, which GEMA also invokes: [...] "If a rights-holder has not transferred to any collecting society the exercise of his rights of <b>cable</b> <b>retransmission</b> in accordance with Article 20b, Paragraph 1, Sentence 1 of the Urheberrechtswahrnehmungsgesetz, then the collecting society that exercises rights of this sort will be considered to be entitled to exercise these rights." ...|$|E
50|$|Cable {{companies}} {{are required by}} the 1992 Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act to negotiate for retransmission consent, usually paying broadcasters {{for the right to}} carry their signals. Broadcasters argued that Aereo was a threat both to their business model, by undermining the <b>cable</b> <b>retransmission</b> fees and the size of their audience. Because the fees cable companies pay for broadcast content can comprise up to 10% of a broadcaster's revenue, broadcasters object to Aereo's re-distribution of this content without paying any fees. Broadcasters have also identified Aereo as part of the cord-cutting trend among television audiences that poses a threat to broadcasters' advertising revenue.|$|E
50|$|ALCS's Ordinary Members sign {{a mandate}} that authorizes the Society to license and collect {{royalties}} on their behalf. ALCS is granted authority to exercise rights on each author's behalf {{as part of}} schemes for the collective administration of royalties in the UK and abroad. The rights range from photocopying, scanning and <b>cable</b> <b>retransmission</b> in the UK and internationally to reproduction in journals. The authority entitles ALCS in agreed circumstances to permit or forbid the exercise of the rights, grant licences, collect fees for use and damages for misuse and take action to defend and protect the rights. ALCS works closely with other writers organisations such as The Society of Authors and Writers' Guild of Great Britain.|$|E
5000|$|In September 2016, Bell Media {{issued a}} {{cease and desist}} order to Vmedia over its Roku-based IPTV service, {{demanding}} the removal of all of its networks. Canadian copyright law allows [...] "retransmitters", defined as [...] "a person who performs a function {{comparable to that of}} a <b>cable</b> <b>retransmission</b> system", to redistribute local and distant broadcast stations as part of their services. However, this only applies to IPTV services operating over private networks, because the law's definition of a retransmitter does not apply to services operating on new media platforms that are not regulated by the CRTC. Vmedia argued that its permission to redistribute these stations fell under its CRTC licensing as a television provider. Bell argued that the over-the-top service did not fall within this definition, or the formal licensing for the IPTV service offered in conjunction with its internet, and thus is a violation of their copyrights. Vmedia representative George Burger disputed Bell's arguments, stating that Canadian copyright law was [...] "technologically neutral", and that broadcasters were [...] "happy to provide that content" [...] to similar, U.S.-based services such as Sling TV. However, he also warned that VMedia {{may not be able to}} afford litigation on the matter, stating that [...] "Bell has untold millions of dollars that it can afford to spend on litigation. We're a startup. We're trying to find our way to profitability." [...] Pending the result of the lawsuit, VMedia removed CTV and CTV Two from the service.|$|E
40|$|Digital technologies, {{especially}} broadband technology, create {{opportunities for}} new services to emerge. A {{good example of}} such a new service in the market of audiovisual content is the so-called «Digital Cloud Recorder» (DCR). How should such a new «device» or service be perceived from a –Belgian– copyright point-of-view? Does the actual legal framework offer the right level of clarity to answer business-relevant questions? In this paper I will discuss the difficult relation of the DCR with traditional copyright concepts: the exceptions for private copying and temporary technical copies, <b>cable</b> <b>retransmission</b> and communication to the public and conclude that not all questions asked can be resolved with a simple yes or no answer. As with many copyright-related issues, the DCR and the entrepreneur wishing to bring it to the market will have to face the considerable risk of legal uncertainty. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The thesis decscribes the {{philosophical}} foundations {{and the historical}} developments {{which led to the}} current state of law in both countries. It evaluates the substantive provisions of the two laws, its distinct aspects as well as its divergences which are a result of different philosophies underlying each national copyright system. The thesis concentrates on the following areas: definition of film, persons qualifying for authorship, duration of copyright, economic and moral rights, defences and remedies for infringement of film copyright. The impact of digitisation on copyright law and its positive and negative effects are explained. Besides, the thesis devotes itself to digital management systems. The thesis also focuses on film distribution and community policies. It describes the European provisions on free movement of goods and services and on competition law as well as the opposing influence of national copyright law. Relevant case law of the European Court of Justice is evaluated and European programmes for the audiovisual sector are described. Furthermore, international and European law, such as the Berne Convention, the Rental and Lending Right Directive, the Satellite Broadcasting and <b>Cable</b> <b>Retransmission</b> Directive, the Directive Harmonising the Term of Protection, the Information Society Directive and the Enforcement Directive are critically examined. Their influence on and the consequential changes to United Kingdom and German copyright law are analysed while special regard is taken to whether national legal understandings are appropriately appreciated.
