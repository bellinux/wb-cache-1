60|$|Those who promise {{low prices}} upon the {{restrictive}} system, take an erroneous {{view of the}} causes which determine the prices of raw produce, and draw an incorrect inference {{from the experience of}} the first half of the last century. As I have stated in another place,(18*) a nation which very greatly gets the start of its neighbours in riches, without any peculiar natural facilities for growing corn, must necessarily submit to one of these alternatives--either a very high <b>comparative</b> <b>price</b> of grain, or a very great dependence upon other countries for it.|$|E
60|$|In Europe, the {{expenses}} attending the carriage of corn are often considerable. They form a natural barrier to importation; {{and even the}} country which habitually depends upon foreign corn, must have the price of its raw produce considerably higher than the general level. Practically, also, the prices of raw produce, in the different countries of Europe, will be variously modified by very different soils, very different degrees of taxation, and very different degrees of improvement in the science of agriculture. Heavy taxation, and a poor soil, may occasion a high <b>comparative</b> <b>price</b> of raw produce, or a considerable dependence on other countries, without great wealth and population; while great improvements in agriculture and a good soil may keep the price of produce low, and the country independent of foreign corn, in spite of considerable wealth. But the principles laid down are the general principles on the subject; and in applying them to any particular case, the particular circumstances of such case must always be taken into consideration.|$|E

40|$|Partially <b>comparative</b> <b>pricing</b> {{involves}} a featured store providing price comparisons {{in reference to}} a competitor for some products (comparatively priced products) while omitting such comparisons and providing only its price for other products (non-comparatively priced products). Barone, Manning and Miniard (2004) found that while partially <b>comparative</b> <b>pricing</b> enhanced consumers 2 ̆ 7 price perceptions of comparatively priced products at the featured retailer, it had the opposite effect for non-comparatively priced products (i. e., an inferiority effect). To the contrary, {{it is argued that}} a price comparison for one brand in a product category may enhance consumers 2 ̆ 7 price perceptions of the remaining, non-comparatively priced brands within the same product category (i. e., a superiority effect). This research seeks to (a) examine the robustness of partially <b>comparative</b> <b>pricing</b> 2 ̆ 7 s effect in an across-product category context compared to a within-product category context and (b) extend the understanding of partially <b>comparative</b> <b>pricing</b> 2 ̆ 7 s within-product category effect on non-comparatively priced brands by examining potential moderators of this effect: brand diversity, brand typicality, and the relative expensiveness of the brand receiving the price comparison. ^ The findings of four studies provide evidence to support the presence of a superiority effect in a within-product category context and suggests that the adverse effect of partially <b>comparative</b> <b>pricing</b> in an across-product category context may not be as robust as previously thought. Although the superiority effect was unaffected by brand diversity (i. e., whether the brands emanated from different manufacturers or from a single manufacturer), it was found to be moderated by the typicality of the brand receiving the price comparison as well as the comparison brand 2 ̆ 7 s relative expensiveness. Research participants formed more favorable relative price beliefs about the non-comparatively priced brand when the comparatively priced brand was perceived as a more typical member of the product category. Similarly, participants formed more favorable beliefs about the non-comparatively priced brand when the comparison price was assigned to the most expensive brand in the product category rather than the least expensive brand. ...|$|R

These countries were gathered into homogenous groups in terms of the following structural economic indicators: GDP per capita, total employment rate, <b>comparative</b> <b>price</b> levels, employment rate of older workers, long term unemployment and productivity of national economies expressed in relation to the European Union (EU- 27) average. Firstly, the cluster analysis was used on three structural economic indicators: GDP per capita, total employment rate and <b>comparative</b> <b>price</b> levels. The hierarchical cluster analysis and non-hierarchical cluster analysis were applied and gave similar results. The factor analysis was then provided to find out the common factors of six structural economic indicators: GDP per capita, total employment rate, <b>comparative</b> <b>price</b> levels, employment rate of older workers, long term unemployment and productivity of national economies. Two factors were extracted and the factor scores for each observation were calculated.

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to analyse the process of price {{convergence}} (beta and sigma convergence) in new EU Member States towards the Euro area (EU- 12). The theoretical part of the paper consists of a brief overview of methods that are employed for analyses of the process of price convergence. Both main concepts - sigma and beta convergence are covered including various tests that are described in greater detail. The empirical part of the paper is focused on testing hypotheses of sigma and beta convergence using macroeconomic data (<b>comparative</b> <b>price</b> levels for GDP) for twelve new EU Member States in the period 1995 - 2008. Various econometrical methods (OLS, 2 SLS, and two dynamic methods) are utilised in order to deal with problems associated with this particular type of analyses. Our results show that both hypotheses (sigma and beta price convergence) do hold for the new EU Member States. The estimated time to close a half of the remaining gap of <b>comparative</b> <b>price</b> levels towards the Euro area average for the group consisting of all new EU Member States (NMS 12) is estimated to be approximately 9. 6 years, for the group of more advanced countries (NMS 5) is approximately 7. 1 years. new EU Member States, international comparisons, <b>comparative</b> <b>price</b> level, beta and sigma convergence...|$|E
