60|$|Among insects {{there are}} innumerable instances; thus Linnaeus, misled by {{external}} appearances, actually classed an homopterous insect as a moth. We see {{something of the}} same kind even with our domestic varieties, as in the strikingly similar shape of the body in the improved breeds of the Chinese and <b>common</b> <b>pig,</b> which are descended from distinct species; and in the similarly thickened stems of the common and specifically distinct Swedish turnip. The resemblance between the greyhound and race-horse is hardly more fanciful than the analogies which have been drawn by some authors between widely different animals.|$|E
60|$|When turnspit {{dogs and}} ancon sheep, {{both of which}} have dwarfed limbs, are crossed with common breeds, the {{offspring}} are not intermediate in structure, but take after either parent. When tailless or hornless animals are crossed with perfect animals, it frequently, but by no means invariably, happens that the offspring are either furnished with these organs in a perfect state, or are quite destitute of them. According to Rengger, the hairless condition of the Paraguay dog is either perfectly or not at all transmitted to its mongrel offspring; but I have seen one partial exception in a dog of this parentage which had part of its skin hairy, and part naked, the parts being distinctly separated as in a piebald animal. When Dorking fowls with five toes are crossed with other breeds, the chickens often have five toes on one foot and four on the other. Some crossed pigs raised by Sir R. Heron between the solid- hoofed and <b>common</b> <b>pig</b> had not all four feet in an intermediate condition, but two feet were furnished with properly divided, and two with united hoofs.|$|E

60|$|Seeing how {{different}} the Chinese pigs, {{belonging to the}} Sus indicus type, are in their osteological characters and in external appearance from the pigs of the S. scrofa type, so {{that they must be}} considered specifically distinct, it is a fact well deserving attention, that Chinese and <b>common</b> <b>pigs</b> have been repeatedly crossed in various manners, with unimpaired fertility. One great breeder who had used pure Chinese pigs assured me that the fertility of the half-breeds inter se and of their recrossed progeny was actually increased; and this is the general belief of agriculturists. Again, the Japan pig or S. pliciceps of Gray is so distinct in appearance from all <b>common</b> <b>pigs,</b> that it stretches one's belief to the utmost to admit that it is simply a domestic variety; yet this breed has been found perfectly fertile with the Berkshire breed; and Mr. Eyton informs me that he paired a half-bred brother and sister and found them quite fertile together.|$|R

6000|$|All these {{circumstances}} {{appear to be}} good evidence of the great antiquity of the legends recorded by Hesiod. In the first place, arguing merely a priori, it is extremely improbable that in the brief interval between {{the date of the}} comparatively pure and noble mythology of the Iliad and the much ruder Theogony of Hesiod men INVENTED stories like the mutilation of Uranus, and the swallowing of his offspring by Cronus. The former legend is almost exactly parallel, as has already been shown, to the myth of Papa and Rangi in New Zealand. The later has its parallels among the savage Bushmen and Australians. It is highly improbable that men in an age so civilised as that of Homer invented myths as hideous as those of the lowest savages. But if we take these myths to be, not new inventions, but the sacred stories of local priesthoods, their antiquity is probably incalculable. The sacred stories, as we know from Pausanias, Herodotus and from all the writers who touch {{on the subject of the}} mysteries, were myths communicated by the priests to the initiated. Plato speaks of such myths in the Republic, 378: [...] "If there is an absolute necessity for their mention, a very few might hear them in a mystery, and then let them sacrifice, not a <b>common</b> <b>pig,</b> but some huge and unprocurable victim; this would have the effect of very greatly diminishing the number of the hearers". This is an amusing example of a plan for veiling the horrors of myth. The pig was the animal usually offered to Demeter, the goddess of the Eleusinian mysteries. Plato proposes to substitute some [...] "unprocurable" [...] beast, perhaps a giraffe or an elephant.|$|E

We present a proof-of-principle study describing an alternative animal model of malignant infarction of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in the <b>common</b> <b>pig</b> and illustrate some of its potential applications. We report on metabolic patterns, ionic profile, brain partial pressure of oxygen (PtiO 2), expression of sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR 1), and the transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (TRPM 4). A 5 -hour ischemic infarct of the MCA territory was performed in 5 2. 5 -to- 3 -month-old female hybrid pigs (Large White x Landrace) using a frontotemporal approach. The core and penumbra areas were intraoperatively monitored to determine the metabolic and ionic profiles. To determine the infarct volume, 2, 3, 5 -triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining and immunohistochemistry analysis was performed to determine SUR 1 and TRPM 4 expression. PtiO 2 monitoring showed an abrupt reduction in values close to 0 mmHg after MCA occlusion in the core area. Hourly cerebral microdialysis showed that the infarcted tissue was characterized by reduced concentrations of glucose (0. 03 mM) and pyruvate (0. 003 mM) and increases in lactate levels (8. 87 mM), lactate-pyruvate ratio (4202), glycerol levels (588 μM), and potassium concentration (27. 9 mmol/L). Immunohistochemical analysis showed increased expression of SUR 1 -TRPM 4 channels. The aim of the present proof-of-principle study was to document the feasibility of a large animal model of malignant MCA infarction by performing transcranial occlusion of the MCA in the <b>common</b> <b>pig,</b> {{as an alternative to}} lisencephalic animals.

This distribution pattern of PERV classes is in line with our previous study on the age of PERV (45) and suggests an African origin of about 7. 5 million years ago (MYA) and a gradual spread of PERV through the Suiformes.

40|$|Mycoplasma hyorhinis is {{a common}} {{inhabitant}} of the upper respiratory tract and tonsils of pigs. Its role as a possible pathogen remains controversial. In order to gain more insight into the epidemiology and population structure of M. hyorhinis we genetically characterized 60 isolates by multi locus sequence typing (MLST). The M. hyorhinis strains originated from Swiss and German pig herds with knowledge on the clinical background. The MLST scheme of Tocqueville et al. (J. Clin. Microbiol. 2014) was optimized, primers for the six MLST gene fragments were newly designed to allow amplification and sequencing with a single protocol. A total of 27 ST were observed with the 60 strains, 26 of those were previously unknown types. Generally identical genotypes were observed within a farm but they differed between farms. The identical genotype was also observed in three different Swiss farms. On the other Hand different genotypes within a farm were found with three German farms. The Swiss isolates formed a distinct cluster but otherwise there was no geographical nor a clinical association with specific Clusters observed. Data shows a high variability of M. hyorhinis comparable to what is observed for Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae. Similar to this pathogen the population structure of M. hyorhinis also shows some limited clonality with predominant genotypes within an animal and a single farm but different ones between farms.

Lameness is acomplex problem with multifactorial causes. Among these causes, osteochondrosis has avery high prevalence in all <b>common</b> <b>pig</b> breeds. Osteochondrosis is a local failure of epiphysisendochondral ossification that can be responsible, in its more severe form, of cracks at the levelof joint cartilage. However, the proportion of lameness that can be linked to osteochondrosisis difficult to evaluate and still unknown. The PROHEALTH project aims at evaluating theinfluence of genetic selection on productive traits on the prevalence of leg {{disorders and}} todevelop a methodology to assess lameness and osteochondrosis. For this purpose, 3 experimentsaimed at measuring the prevalence of osteochondrosis in several populations of pigs. The testedpig populations included two divergent lines of Large-White selected for a feed efficiency trait(high or low residual feed intake) and two lines of Landrace selected for either their high fertilityperformance or their high growth performance. The Large-White populations were submittedto different constraints on the physical activity. These experiments also allowed identifying sexeffects as females, entire and castrated males were studied within similar populations. All theseexperiments showed that osteochondrosis is very common in femur and humerus joints. InLandrace pigs, only 11 % of the examined joints (539) were discovered as normal and 89 % ofjoints had some signs of osteochondrosis.
