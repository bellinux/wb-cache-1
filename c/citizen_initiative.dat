2500|$|Victor Steinbrueck was {{the leading}} architect-activist in {{defining}} the Pike Market neighborhood, and artist Mark Tobey in visualizing and recording, in developing his [...] "Northwest Mystic" [...] style of the internationally recognized Northwest School of art. Internationally recognized in the 1940s, Tobey explored the neighborhood with his art in the 1950s and early 1960s, as the area was being increasingly characterized by the Seattle Establishment as overdue for urban renewal, particularly replacement with a parking garage, high-rise housing and modern, upscale retail. People of city neighborhoods and citizen preservation activists struggled through the 1960s, culminating in 1971 with 2 to 1 passage of a <b>citizen</b> <b>initiative</b> for protection and citizen oversight of the core Pike Place Market that has since largely protected the neighborhood.|$|E

In 2002 she became the proponent of an Initiative under BC Recall and Initiative Act to hold a referendum on whether or not to adopt MMP in BC. Called the Free Your Vote campaign, it brought together a broad coalition of British Columbians and even included the official support of trade unions such as the BC Nurses' in a petition drive under the province's <b>citizen</b> <b>initiative</b> legislation. Despite having condemned this legislation as unworkable after an anti-grizzly bear hunting initiative by her husband, proponent Paul George failed to gather and submit sufficient signatures, Carr threw the energies into this campaign which, although it too failed to gather sufficient signatures in all but four ridings, The nearly 100,000 signatures gathered created the largest voting reform organization in the province and increased awareness and support amongst Greens and non-Greens alike for electoral reform. Many credit it with spurring the Liberals to establish a Citizens Assembly on Electoral Reform a few months later.|$|E
