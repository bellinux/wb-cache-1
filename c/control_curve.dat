To obtain greater operating convenience, the invention strives to achieve as low an opening resistance in the door closer as possible when the door is opened manually, but nevertheless closing the door reliably during the closing process. This problem is solved {{by the fact that the}} characteristic of the torque acting on the leaf and depending on the rotary angle of the leaf is different for opening than for closing as a result of the interaction of the sliding spring with a <b>control</b> <b>curve</b> which has separate curve sections for opening and closing.

Corrosion, predominantly as a result of carbonation of the concrete, was associated with a limited amount of cracking. A monitoring technique was established in which probe electrodes (reference and counter) were retro-fitted into the concrete. The probe electrode setup was identical for all panels tested. It was found that the corrosion behaviour of all panels tested closely fitted a family of results when the corrosion potential is plotted against the polarisation resistance (Rp). This enabled the development of a so-called 2 ̆ 7 <b>control</b> <b>curve</b> 2 ̆ 7 relating the corrosion potential to the Rp for all of the panels under investigation. This relationship was also confirmed on laboratory samples, indicating that for a fixed geometry and experimental conditions a relationship between the potential and polarisation resistance of steel can be established for the steel-concrete system.

The establishment of such a <b>control</b> <b>curve</b> has enabled the development of a powerful monitoring tool for the assessment of a number of proposed corrosion remediation techniques.

40|$|The broad {{objective}} of this thesis {{is the development of}} application-specific, computation ally efficient image processing approaches in the light of Bayesian theory when applied to Biomedical Imagery. Due to its rigorous theoretical background and precise formula expression, the Bayesian method has been successfully applied in image processing over the years. Based on the investigation of relationships between various optimization criteria within the Bayesian framework, the main contributions of this thesis lie in the development of four different, but interrelated, image processing approaches with strong connections to curve evolution and estimation techniques. The first contribution of this thesis is the development of a novel adaptive bias correction approach by applying the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique in image alignment. A hierarchical model is proposed for estimating the accumulated bias and the unknown mean is simulated by a Gibbs sampler. Then, the scale parameters are estimated such that the equalization transformation can be performed semi-automatically. Another contribution of this thesis is the development of an application-specific improvement to the classical Geodesic Active Contours method where a prior model is used to incorporate prior information into the scheme. The third contribution of this thesis is the development of a coupling method in boundary finding of Regions of Interest, which combines advantages of both edge-based and region-based techniques. The key behind this approach is the use of a mixture modelling technique that produces the image energy by applying the Bayesian method in order to <b>control</b> <b>curve</b> evolution. The final contribution of this thesis is the development of a termination criterion that offers a reliable method to <b>control</b> <b>curve</b> evolution and help curve convergence. Here we apply the Bayesian method to generate a stability index which is used to <b>control</b> <b>curve</b> evolution leading to more stable and efficient curve evolution.

The preliminary results of our research indicate that the ge-ometrical factor of safety of the pointed groin vault proved to be the highest.
