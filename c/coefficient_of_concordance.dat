Currently, only conventional imaging techniques are employed; however, alternative imaging modalities using visible and non-visible light may provide additional information. We sought to determine the image modality preferences of paediatricians and the between-observer agreement therein. Nine paediatricians who work in child protection independently compared five image modalities (conventional colour, conventional grey-scale, cross-Polarised, ultraviolet, and infrared) of four bruises, with a compliance rate of 95 %. All images were taken using a standardised set of protocols with Nikon D 90 cameras and 105 -mm macro-lenses. The paediatricians almost unanimously chose cross-Polarised as their preferred modality for all four bruises when assessing boundary, shape, colour, size, and absence of light reflectance. Conventional colour and grey-scale imaging were typically ranked second and third. Ultraviolet and infrared were consistently ranked in the least two favourable positions. Between-observer agreement on ranking order was high, with <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>concordance</b> ranging from 0. 76 to 0. 96. Combinations of imaging modalities chosen to give the most complete picture of the bruise predominantly consisted of cross-Polarised and conventional (colour and grey-scale).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Esophageal {{impedance}} measurement {{is a novel}} method for gastroesophageal reflux monitoring. Reproducibility is {{an important aspect of}} every biomedical test. The aim of this study was therefore to asses the reproducibility of gastroesophageal reflux monitoring using {{impedance measurement}}s. METHODS: Impedance and pH signals were recorded in 20 healthy volunteers during 90 -min postprandial periods on two separate days. Hourly rates of gas, liquid, and mixed gas-liquid reflux episodes were measured in each recording period as well as percentage of time with pH < 4 and rate of acid reflux episodes. As a quantitative description of inter- and intraindividual variation for each variable, the mean percentage of covariation (100 x SD/mean: %COV) was calculated. As a second measure for reproducibility, Kendall's <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>concordance</b> (W values) were calculated. RESULTS: For all variables, interindividual %COV was at least 50 % higher than intraindividual %COV. Statistically significant concordances were found for gas reflux (W = 0. 81, p= 0. 04) and mixed reflux (W = 0. 85, p= 0. 03) while concordance for liquid reflux tended to be significant (W = 0. 75, p= 0. 08). This was comparable to the reproducibility of the number of acid reflux episodes and percentage of time with pH < 4 (W = 0. 78, p= 0. 05 and W = 0. 88, p= 0. 02, respectively).

Three-dimensional arterial spin-labeling, with its high signal-to-noise ratio, enables measurement of cerebral blood flow precisely without any extrinsic tracers. We evaluated the performance of 3 D arterial spin-labeling compared with SPECT, and demonstrated the 3 D arterial spin-labeled imaging characteristics in the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. MATERIALS ANDMETHODS: This study included 68 patients with clinically suspected Alzheimer disease who underwent both 3 D arterial spin-labeling and SPECT imaging. Two readers independently assessed both images. Kendall W <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>concordance</b> (K) were computed, and receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed for each reader. The differences between the images in regional perfusion distribution were evaluated by means of statistical parametric mapping, and the incidence of hypoperfusion of the cerebral watershed area, referred to as “borderzone sign ” in the 3 D arterial spin-labeled images, was determined. RESULTS: Readers showed K 0. 82 / 0. 73 for SPECT/ 3 D arterial spin-labeled imaging, and the respective areas under the receiver operating characteristic curvewere 0. 82 / 0. 69 for reader 1 and 0. 80 / 0. 69 for reader 2. Statistical parametricmapping showed that theperisylvian andmedial parieto-occipital perfusion in the arterial spin-labeled images was significantly higher than that in the SPECT images.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to explore what leadership styles are effective with Millennial employees, which led to a key research question: Which leadership styles facilitate employee motivation for the Millennial generation? The theoretical framework was based on the social learning, transformational leadership, and servant leadership theories, which were used to identify effective leadership styles. In the theoretical framework, different motivation theories were presented to establish the context in which motivation was discussed. This quantitative study used a survey administered online to collect data using the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire, Ethical Leadership at Work Questionnaire, and SL- 7 instruments. The participant pool consisted of randomly selected Millennial generation employees (N = 158) who worked in an office setting. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to test for stochasticity.

The {{purpose of this study}} is to assess the inter-observer and intra-observer {{reliability}} of the Harris hip score among senior orthopedic residents at the Philippine General Hospital. Methods. Twenty-four hips from 20 patients were evaluated using the Harris hip score by four senior residents from the Department of Orthopedics, Philippine General Hospital. All patients were interviewed twice in the clinic and the reliability of the HHS was evaluated. Results. The inter-observer <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>concordance</b> (Kendall <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>concordance</b> W) was 0. 9 for both groups of observers. The intra-observer coefficients of concordance were 0. 8, 1. 0, 0. 9, and 0. 9, for the four observers. A 0 value indicates no concordance among a set of raters while a score of 1 indicates perfect concordance. Obtaining a score greater than 0. 75 represents excellent level of agreement. Conclusion.

The incidence of suboptimal gait in breeding flocks is controlled {{through the use of a}} visual gait score, which is a subjective assessment of walking ability of each bird. The subjective nature of the visual gait score has led to concerns over its effectiveness in reducing the incidence of suboptimal gait in poultry through breeding. The aims of this study were to assess the reliability of the current visual gait scoring system in ducks and to develop a more objective method to select for better gait. ResultsExperienced gait scorers assessed short video clips of walking ducks to estimate the reliability of the current visual gait scoring system. Kendall’s <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>concordance</b> between and within observers were estimated at 0. 49 and 0. 75, respectively. In order to develop a more objective scoring system, gait components were visually scored on more than 4000 pedigreed Pekin ducks and genetic parameters were estimated for these components. Gait components, which are a more objective measure, had heritabilities that were as good as, or better than, those of the overall visual gait score. ConclusionsMeasurement of gait components is simpler and therefore more objective than the standard visual gait score. The recording of gait components can potentially be automated, which may increase accuracy further and may improve heritability estimates. Genetic correlations were generally low, which suggests that it is possible to use gait components to select for an overall improvement in both economic traits and gait as part of a balanced breeding programme...|$|R

Thirty-one patients [20 male/ 11 female; 57 · 1 ± 6 · 5 yr (mean±S. D.) ] with a variety of movement disorders were recorded on videotape according to the SADIMoD Schedule. Single representatives of all six teams scored these video recordings. To this set the existing SADIMoD ratings of 82 patients were added to form the so-called ¿total data set¿. These patients were examined by 6 different researchers, who rated 4, 8, 10, 14, 18 and 28 patients, respectively, mostly in the context of a research protocol. A specific subset consisted of 12 patients that were examined three times with a two-weekly interval without any change of their medical condition or treatment. The 6 ratings of the 31 individual patients correlated to a highly significant degree, with Kendall's <b>Coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>Concordance</b> <b>of</b> 0 · 436 to 0 · 891 (median 0 · 717). The same was true for the 6 ratings of the 7 SADIMoD subscales (median 0 · 578, range 0 · 462 ¿ 0 · 715) Considering the total data set, the homogeneity of the various subscales was good (Cronbach's [alpha] = 0 · 81 ¿ 0 · 94, median: 0 · 87). The SADIMoD dyskinesia and dystonia subscales showed a highly significant mutual correlation. The Parkinsonism subscale correlated highly significantly with the rest and postural tremor subscales and to a lesser extent with the akathisia and ataxia subscales. An analysis of variance showed that the three ratings in the subset of 12 patients were not significantly different for any scale. Also Scheffé tests for homogenous subsets did not reveal any significant differences. When investigated under ¿real world¿ circumstances, the inter-rater reliability of the SADIMoD was found to be satisfying.

Currently, only conventional (unfiltered visible light) imaging is employed; however, alternative imaging modalities may provide additional information. Observer variation in interpretation of colour and age of bruises, using conventional imaging techniques, is considerable. Findings from two pilot studies will be presented: (1) Within- and between-observer variation when measuring bruises on printed and digital conventional images; (2) Image modality preference of paediatricians when assessing bruise photographs, and between-observer agreement therein. Methods Study (1) 45 observers recorded the greatest lengths of six bruises on two occasions. All completed manual and electronic measurements, using a paper tape-measure for printed images and ImageJ software on a lap-top for digital images. Study (2) Nine Child Protection paediatricians independently ranked five image modalities (conventional colour, conventional grey-scale, cross-Polarised, ultraviolet, and infrared), for four bruises, by completing a questionnaire. Results Study (1) Widespread observer variation existed for both manual and electronic measurements; within-observer SD ranged from 2. 1 to 4. 7, between-observer SD from 2. 1 to 5. 2. Observers {{were found to be}} prone to rounding bias (digit preference to nearest 5 mm) upon manual assessment. Paired t tests showed mean bruise sizes were smaller for manual measurements than for electronic, this difference was significant 10 of 12 times. Study (2) Paediatricians almost unanimously preferred cross-Polarised for all four bruises when assessing boundary, shape, colour, size, and absence of light reflectance. Conventional colour and grey-scale were typically ranked second and third. Ultraviolet and infrared were consistently ranked in the last two positions.

40|$|Dissertation {{completed}} at the University of Minnesota, 1982 The use of micronuclei frequency/microspore quartet (MF) {{has been proposed}} to indicate relative reduction in chromosome homology among interspecific oat (Avena L.) hybrids. Hybrids with lower MF presumably undergo greater genetic recombination, providing greater opportunity for breaking linkages contributing to association, or coherence, of desirable and undesirable characters in progenies. Progeny lines from eight A. sativa L. /A. fatua L. crosses were evaluated with parents and check cultivars to determine whether A. fatua might contribute useful variation for improving agronomic and grain quality characters in cultivated oats and whether a relationship exists between MF and character coherence. Differential emergence among progeny lines due to seed dormancy accounted for some variability in grain yield in 1980. In 1981, five crosses had population means for grain yield equal to their A. sativa parents. All crosses contained lines that equalled or exceeded A. sativa parents or check cultivars for grain yield. High groat oil in A. fatua parents and progenies indicated A. fatua {{could be used to}} increase oil levels in cultivated oats. Though parents did not differ from groat protein all crosses had variation among lines, indicating fatua may have different genes than A. sativa. Progeny lines with dark seed color or shattering habit were higher for harvest index, earlier, shorter, and lower in groat oil, groat protein and groat percentage than light-colored or nonshattering lines. Character coherence was examined in progenies from four A. sativa/L. fatua hybrids with high MF and four hybrids with low MF. The degree of coherence of seed disarticulation and color with quantitative traits that distinguish the parental species was not related to differences in MF among these crosses. Likewise, the degree of coherence among the quantitative characters studied, as measured by <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>concordance,</b> was not associated with differences in MF among the crosses. The analyses used could detect only character coherence and not genetic recombination, per se. Accurate genotypic measurements of characters controlled by genes on potentially abnormally pairing chromosomes are necessary to determine a relationship of MF with recombination and character coherence...|$|R

40|$|It is the {{consensus}} of scholars that the productivity of the construction industry is very low when compared with other industries. Concurrent Engineering (CE), which has a primary goal of reducing the total time from designing a product to releasing it into the market, while creating better designs as well, {{has been identified as}} one of the concepts that has yielded effective adaptation in the construction industry. An exploratory survey was used to identify 63 variables with the capacity to influence the uptake of Concurrent Engineering in Nigeria and was used to design a questionnaire, which was distributed to 50 stratified construction industry stakeholders. A statistical software package (STATISTIXL) was used to analyse the severity index of each variable, in order to establish the importance of each variable in influencing the uptake of Concurrent engineering and also to compute the Kendall’s <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>concordance,</b> which assess the levels of agreement among the judges on the consistency of the rankings. A Kendall’s <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>concordance</b> of W= 0. 57365 was recorded. A lack of awareness emerged as the most important barrier against the integration of this concept into the Nigerian construction industry. The top five variables are all human factors that can be ameliorated by proper education...|$|E
30|$|These {{overall results}} show that {{differences}} are statistically significant between the evaluated TMOs {{as well as between}} the different scenarios that were considered. The consistency of the rankings was also significant since the computed Kendall’s <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>concordance</b> was W= 0.17. The rank order obtained shows that Pat was the best ranked TMO. ManPat was second grouped with PatMan and Man while PatMan was third grouped with Man. Also, although there were two groups ranking the scenes, {{there was no significant difference}} between them which is a good result indicating coherence between choices.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} crucial {{decisions}} that is regularly exercised by construction contractors is to determine whether to bid or not to bid on a certain project. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to understand key factors that are considered by top Jordanian contractors in their bid/no-bid decision making. Previous research in the Jordanian construction market reported the importance weights of 53 bid/no-bid factors (El-Mashaleh, 2013). Based on that work, this paper discusses the top bidding factors and compares them with international related work. Additionally, the paper examines the reliability of El-Mashaleh’s (2013) study based on Cronbach's alpha reliability test. Furthermore, the paper tests the degree of consensus among the respondents of El-Mashaleh’s (2013) work regarding the ranking of the 53 bid/no-bid decision factors based on Kendall's <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>concordance.</b> Finally, analysis of variance (ANOVA) is conducted to test statistical significant differences in the importance weights of the 53 bidding factors between public and private bidders. Cronbach's alpha reliability test proves that the adopted scale of measurement for the importance of the bid/no-bid factors has excellent internal consistency reliability. Kendall's <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>concordance</b> reveals a significant degree of consensus among the respondents regarding the ranking of the bid/no-bid decision factors. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicates statistical significant differences in importance weights between public and private bidders for 6 factors out of the 53 factors considered...|$|E
