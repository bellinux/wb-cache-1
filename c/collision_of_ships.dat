High vessel traffic density in Madura Strait gives serious threat due to navigational safety in this area, i. e. ship collision. This study is necessary as an attempt to enhance the safety of marine traffic. Fuzzy inference system (FIS) is proposed to calculate risk <b>collision</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships.</b> Collision risk is evaluated based on ship domain, Distance to Closest Point of Approach (DCPA), and Time to Closest Point of Approach (TCPA). Data were collected by utilizing Automatic Identification System (AIS). This study considers several ships’ domain models to give the characteristic of marine traffic in the waterways. Each encounter in the ship domain is analyzed to obtain the level of collision risk. Risk level of ships, as the result in this study, can be used as guidance to avoid the accident, providing brief description about safety traffic in Madura Strait and improving the navigational safety in the area...|$|E
40|$|<b>Collision</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> {{with oil}} tankers poses, next to grounding, {{one of the}} most serious {{environmental}} threats at sea. In many previous analyses of the collision problem, the bow of the impacting ship was considered rigid. The objective of the present research is to include the finite strength of the bow in the overall collision simulation. The emphasis will be placed on typical raked shapes because some work already has been reported in the past on bulbous bows. The main structural members will include side shell and the deck. Transverse and longitudinal stiffeners will be taken into account by means of a smearing technique. A structural model is developed by identifying localized zones of plastic deformations from photographs of damaged ships. Then, the contributions of the membrane and bending resistance is assessed and a simple computational model is developed. The solution includes determination of the force-indentation relationship, a number of folds and a total amount of damage for a given speed of a ship. Five scale model tests were run and the force-deflection characteristics were recorded. A good correlation was obtained between the analytical solution and experimental results. by Ji Young Kim.

40|$|This article {{presents}} the different solutions provided by various statutes, case law and legal doctrine {{on the subject}} of contributory negligence {{in the event of a}} <b>collision</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships.</b> With regard to collision cases in Roman-Dutch law, there were various views on the legal solution in cases where two ships collided and both captains had acted negligently. The Hoge Raad decided that where it was not clear who had acted negligently, or where the negligence was equal on both sides, the damage had to be regarded as common and both should bear the damage equally. This decision obviously contrasts with that advanced by Roman law. The Roman approach was adopted as a basis by legal doctrine scholars such as Van Bijnkershoek, and later Van der Keessel, who argued that each should bear his own loss. Interestingly, this view was supported by two local statutes. The article ends with a discussion on another situation, namely that of a stationary ship being hit by a sailing ship. Van der Keessel considered the fault of the sailing ship as more serious and therefore argued that the fault of the (captain of the) sailing ship could not be compensated by the fault of the stationary ship. Thereby he introduced a renewed application of the medieval culpae compensatio doctrine...|$|E
40|$|It {{is within}} the {{framework}} of the discipline called tort law that the rules of compensation for damages are to be found. The Swedish general tort law is subsidiary, which means that laws that in the light of the question at hand seam more adequate shall be applied instead of the ordinary tort law. Within the framework of what is colloquially called maritime tort law (sjöskaderätt), one may for example sort legal rules concerning compensation for damages occurred under transport, by escape of oil from ships or damages occurred by <b>collision</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships.</b> There are differences between the ordinary material law of torts and the material law of maritime tort law. Insofar one argues that legal, formal, coherency is the proper yardstick of legal legitimacy either the ordinary tort law or the marine tort law has to be wrong. Of course, one could argue that the correct yardstick is consequential coherence and that only the result matters independent of what kind of instrument (the joint and several- or the pro rata liability) that is used. Another argument would be that there are differences as well in theory as in practice, but that those differences are justified in the light of that the political motives may differ between those the systems of law.

40|$|<b>Collision</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> is {{the most}} {{frequent}} accident in modern navigation. Provision of up-to-date navigational equipment does not automatically mean fewer collisions. As a matter of fact, there are more collisions {{because the number of}} vessels is constantly increasing. Due to the increased traffic density vessels meet at shorter distances, so they have very little time and space left for appropriate collision avoidance manoeuvre. The Collision Avoidance Rules themselves do not represent sufficient guarantee to avoid collisions, since the researches made in the human factor showed that 10 % of all collisions were caused by non compliance with the Rules and 90 % by other human errors. Furthermore, collisions are basically not caused by inadequate interpretations of the Rules, but above all, by wrong interpretations of the situations taking place at sea. This is the consequence of insufficient training on RADAR and Automatic Radar Plotting Aids, and particularly of misinterpretation of the results of radar plotting procedures. Generally all accidents of ships can be divided into two basic categories. First, accidents in which measures for damage control should be taken immediately, and second, those which require a little more patient reaction. And the fact that collisions belong to the first category has encouraged writing of the current paper. The proposed model of optimal collision avoidance manoeuvre. of ships on the basis of electronic data collection was made by means of the navigation simulator NTPRO – 5000...|$|E

40|$|A new impact {{panel has}} been used to measure forces and {{pressures}} during <b>collisions</b> <b>of</b> a <b>ship</b> (CCGS Terry Fox) with bergy bits and a small iceberg. Data were acquired from impacts on bergy bits of various sizes (100 - 22, 000 tonnes) and over a range <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> speeds (5 - 12 kt). The data indicate that a typical zone of ice contact during a <b>collision</b> is comprised <b>of</b> a small irregular shaped area of relatively intact ice, where the pressure is high (8 - 20 MPa) and roughly uniform, that is usually surrounded by a larger area of pulverized ice, where the pressure is low (~ 2. 5 MPa). The maximum estimated force measured was around 2. 4 MN. The relatively low force values were attributed to the slanted shape of the impacted hull resulting in a glancing/sliding type of impact with limited ice penetration.
