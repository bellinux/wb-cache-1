The premaxillaries on either side of the upper jaw are able to rotate nearly 180° down to trap prey attracted by the luminescent lure; this <b>closing</b> <b>action</b> is effected by large, extremely well developed upper jaw muscles.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Resin {{transfer}} molding (RTM) {{is one of}} the most popular polymer composites manufacturing processes because it provides the advantages of low injection pressure, fast cyclic periods, and the ability to mold parts with highly complex shapes. However, the mold-filling process may need a long time for some cases such as large parts or parts with low permeability of the reinforcement. A flexible RTM process, compression {{transfer molding}} (CTM), is developed to reduce the mold-filling time. The mold-filling process of CTM can be divided into resin-injection and mold-closing periods. Flow visualization experiments are carried out to understand the flow behavior of each period in the CTM mold-filling process. As the <b>closing</b> <b>action</b> of the mold proceeds before the resin-injection period ends, experiments are also performed to investigate the effect of simultaneous procedures on the total mold-filling time.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{anatomy and}} {{function}} of the opening between the knee joint cavity and the gastro-cnemio-semimembranosus bursa was studied in 120 necropsy specimens of knee joints both by conventional knife dissection and by a newly modified technique of serial cryosectioning of unde-calcified joints frozen at various angles of flexion. The communication invariably took {{the shape of a}} transverse slit separating the capsule from the undersurface of the gastrocnemius tendon. On flexion it opened as the pull from the semimembranosus tendon and the medial meniscus widened the gap. On extension the communication was closed by compression by the overlying tendons. A functional <b>closing</b> <b>action</b> was invariably demonstrated, whereas no unidirectional valve mechanism was found. In the 1840 s Adams observed cystic swelling in the popliteal region of knees affected by 'chronic rheumatoid arthritis ' so frequently that he considered it to be a reliable symptom of rheumatoid affection of the joint. He observed that the swelling was due to an enlargement of the bursa beneath the medial hea...|$|E

40|$|Applicability of the {{bremsstrahlung}} {{counting device}} to a changeover system of a tritium flow channel has been examined.
