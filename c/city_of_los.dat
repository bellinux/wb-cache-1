The following day, the watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning for areas between Buenavista and Agua Blanca.

5|$|The game {{takes place}} in the <b>city</b> <b>of</b> <b>Los</b> Angeles, in the year 1947, with players {{assuming}} the role of Los Angeles Police Department officer, and later detective, Cole Phelps. The game starts with Phelps as a uniformed patrolman, and follows his career as he advances through the police department bureaus (desks) of Traffic, Homicide, Vice and Arson. Each desk gives players a new partner who will help Phelps in his investigation of a number of cases based on a specific type of crime. The game assigns players with cases that they must solve. After each case, players receive a rating of 1–5 stars depending on their performance in both interrogations and searching for clues. In some cases, when searching an area for clues to the crime, players can also find newspapers. Besides reading the story, the newspapers give access to a short cinematic that either covers a part of the game's overarching plot or a flashback to Phelps' war memories. Near the end of the final desk, players assume control of private investigator Jack Kelso, who becomes the player character for {{most of the rest of}} the game; although different in appearance and personality, he controls identically to Phelps.|$|E
