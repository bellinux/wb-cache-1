5|$|Although usually sedate and approachable underwater, Pacific {{angelsharks}} {{are quick}} to bite if touched, captured, or otherwise provoked, and can inflict severe lacerations.

The capacity of this species to withstand a focused fishing effort is limited, due to its low rates of reproduction and movement.|$|E
