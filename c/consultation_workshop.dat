50|$|Water {{privatization}} in Ghana {{has been}} discussed since the early 1990s {{as a reaction to}} poor service quality and low efficiency of the existing urban water utility Ghana Water and Sewerage Corporation (GWSC), renamed Ghana Water Company Ltd. (GWCL) in 1999. The World Bank supported the process of private sector participation in the urban water sector from the beginning. Following preparatory studies and a national <b>consultation</b> <b>workshop</b> in 1995, the government opted for two 10-year lease contracts among 8 options, including the option to continue public sector operation. Critics argue that the workshop participants had been arbitrarily chosen, that the majority of participants were foreigners, that no local NGOs participated and that the public sector option had not been given due consideration. Furthermore, they argue that a single workshop was not sufficient to prepare such an important decision, that no major public debate had taken place and that the final decision should have been taken by Parliament. According to the decision made by the government, each of the two leases was to cover about half the cities and towns of Ghana. The private operators were expected to invest US$132 million from their own resources, corresponding to about one fourth of the total expected investments over the lease period. The contracts were expected to increase water production by 85%, connections by 50% and reduce non-revenue water from 52% to 25%. These expectations proved to be clearly unrealistic in retrospect.|$|E

40|$|Objectives Medically unexplained {{symptoms}} (MUS) present {{frequently in}} healthcare, can be complex and frustrating for clinicians and patients {{and are often}} associated with overinvestigation and significant costs. Doctors {{need to be aware}} of appropriate management strategies for such patients early in their training. A previous qualitative study with foundation year doctors (junior doctors in their first 2 years postqualification) indicated significant lack of knowledge about this topic and appropriate management strategies. This study reviewed whether, and in what format, UK foundation training programmes for newly qualified doctors include any teaching about MUS and sought recommendations for further development of such training. Design Mixed-methods design comprising a web-based questionnaire survey and an expert <b>consultation</b> <b>workshop.</b> Setting Nineteen foundation schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland Participants Questionnaire administered via email to 155 foundation training programme directors (FTPDs) attached to the 19 foundation schools, followed by an expert <b>consultation</b> <b>workshop</b> attended by 13 medical educationalists, FTPDs and junior doctors. Results The 53 / 155 (34. 2 %) FTPDs responding to the questionnaire represented 15 of the 19 foundation schools, but only 6 / 53 (11 %) reported any current formal teaching about MUS within their programmes. However, most recognised the importance of providing such teaching, suggesting 2 – 3 [*]hours per year. All those attending the expert <b>consultation</b> <b>workshop</b> recommended case-based discussions, role-play and the use of videos to illustrate positive and negative examples of doctor–patient interactions as educational methods of choice. Educational sessions should cover the skills needed to provide appropriate explanations for patients’ symptoms as well as avoid unnecessary investigations, and providing information about suitable treatment options. Conclusions There is an urgent need to improve foundation level training about MUS, as current provision is very limited. An interactive approach covering a range of topics is recommended, but must be delivered within a realistic time frame for the curriculum...|$|E

This national ICT and radio <b>consultation</b> <b>workshop</b> brought together 28 participants representing government MDAs, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), UN agencies, academic and research institutions, farmer based organizations, and telecom operators to brainstorm best options to streamline delivering tailored climate information to end users. The two-day workshop was held in Dar es Salaam on 27 - 28, April 2015. The workshop began with {{a brief overview of}} the objectives, methodology, and key recommendations from each study. This was followed by a summary of important findings, and then a question-and-answer session in which participants agreed with the key recommendations and overall findings. Participants were introduced to a draft information flow model that includes three important components: production, delivery and feedback. The plenary session gave participants room to share feedback from discussion groups.

40|$|Objectives  The study {{aimed to}} clarify patient-centred professionalism {{within and across}} {{community}} pharmacy settings; position that knowledge in a modern-day environment, accessing the opinions and experiences of patients and professionals; inform {{the literature on the}} value of <b>consultation</b> <b>workshops</b> within this context; and develop a template of positive and challenging exemplars of patient-centred professionalism within these contexts. Methods  Thirty-nine study participants contributed to extended <b>consultation</b> <b>workshops.</b> Sessions were supported by bio-photographic data of healthcare practices across a range of different settings, and a final forum event. Key findings  Thematic analysis of qualitative data, supported by the Nominal Group Work technique, led to a template containing 11 themes of positive and challenging aspects of patient-centred professionalism: safety, professional characteristics, relationships with patients, confidentiality and privacy, accessibility, training, professional pressures, services, environment, changing professional roles and patient characteristics. Themes, while descriptive and rich, highlight difficulties in defining this notion, which is both nuanced and ambiguous. While study participants were interested in the everyday examples of practice and interaction, they were strongly influenced by their different agendas and experiences. Patients, for example, wanted a quick and efficient dispensing service, where their needs and expectations came first. Pharmacists, on the other hand, found that pressing patient demands and overarching company policies led to professional anxiety that distracted them from what they perceived to be the defining aspect of their professionalism, dispensary work. Conclusions  The study outcomes indicate, in line with international literature, that while proud of supporting patients, many pharmacists feel demoralised, torn between pressing public and professional demands and the expectations of advice-giving in unfamiliar, formal situations within nondescript, corporate workspaces...|$|R

Design: The qualitative study {{was based on a}} literature review, consultations and testing of a framework through workshops and an interactive information session. Setting: <b>Consultations,</b> <b>workshops</b> and an information session conducted in western regions of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Method: A framework was designed {{to address the needs of}} CALD community members to self-manage chronic conditions using innovative digital technology strategies. This was based on the literature review and 20 consultations held with representatives from health service providers and community organizations. The framework was tested with the assistance of the Quang Minh Buddhist Temple through <b>consultations,</b> <b>workshops</b> and an interactive information session about diabetes, YouTube and digital video cameras, in which 38 elderly women from the Vietnamese community participated. A descriptive and thematic analysis of participant feedback was conducted to determine lessons for future practice.

Place and Duration of Study: Community Pharmacy across South West Wales, United Kingdom (UK) between 2009 and 2010. Methodology: We describe the research methodology involved in an adapted Nominal Group Technique. We carried out the adapted NGT exercise in homogenous <b>consultation</b> <b>workshops</b> following the traditional approach which resulted in the generation of individual consensus lists of the important issues related to the posed question. In order to ensure that issues highlighted within different <b>consultation</b> <b>workshops</b> were maintained in the outputs we further developed the NGT approach, firstly by bringing common issues together by applying a thematization process and then further applying a second consensus building exercise based on the developed themes with a mixed population group. By supplementing consensus data with qualitative data collected during the research process, we further explored and justified the consensus reached. Results: We successfully applied the adapted NGT within the community pharmacy setting and were able to gain consensus regarding the positive and challenging aspects of patient- centred professionalism. Using qualitative data collected, we were able to describe in more detail the issues raised and the justification for the consensus reached. Conclusion: Using an adapted NGT, we describe how consensus was reached regarding the study question and how the basis for the consensus was explored. By applying this adapted NGT we were able to gain consensus regarding the relative importance of the issues under discussion across a mixed population group.
