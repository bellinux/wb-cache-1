30|$|The {{influences}} of heating history, cooling method, and <b>cooling</b> <b>set</b> on microstructures and the mechanical properties of water-swollen wood were studied by measuring viscoelastic properties and dimensional changes while elevating temperatures between 20 °C and 90 °C. Both the viscoelastic properties and dimensional changes of waterswollen {{wood in the}} first heating process were quite different {{from those in the}} other heating processes. The results revealed that the molecular state of green wood around room temperature was stabilized and could not return to this state if drying or heating was carried out. Cooling methods greatly affected the viscoelastic properties, while they hardly affected dimensional changes when the temperature was elevated. Localized stress in the microstructures of water-swollen wood produced by quenching affected the mechanical properties in the heating process, while external stress less than the proportional limit caused by a <b>cooling</b> <b>set</b> had no effect. This revealed that much greater localized stress linked to the instability of waterswollen wood than the external stress in relation to the <b>cooling</b> <b>set</b> occurred.|$|E

40|$|In 2011 - 12, {{greenhouse}} gas emissions from the Australian residential sector were 101. 6 Mt {{and are expected to}} grow by 38 % by 2050. In order to reduce these emissions, much emphasis has been placed on increasing the energy efficiency of buildings and appliances. Occupant behaviour, however, is probably the single most significant factor which determines energy use and emissions. This paper describes research undertaken to rank the most common occupant behaviours, based upon their impact on {{greenhouse gas}} emissions associated with residential energy use, in an architect-designed house in Australia. The occupant behaviours investigated were changing: the heating and cooling temperature set points, window openings, external blind use and lighting use. Simulations were carried out using Primero and EnergyPlus software.

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{economic}} development of China, the living standards in rural areas have been experiencing improvement {{over the past two}} decades. One important aspect of the improved living standards is housing, which has been transformed from traditional adobe or stone structures into modern brick and concrete ones. In the meantime, active heating and cooling systems are gradually being incorporated and residents are requiring more comfortable indoor air temperatures during cold winters and hot summers. However, most rural houses have no insulation in their exterior walls and roofs. The {{question is whether or not}} it is economically viable to build houses with insulated exterior walls and roofs, and to what extent should they be insulated. ^ In order to answer these questions, the author has created one base hypothetical case and two evolutionary hypothetical cases. The base case is assumed to represent typical rural houses in the studied region of northern rural China, with its heating set point temperature at 13 °C (55 °F) and <b>cooling</b> <b>set</b> point temperature at 29 °C (84 °F). The two revolutionary hypothetical cases, reflecting the improving living standards in rural areas in the future, are the same with the base case, except that the set point temperatures are different. The heating set point temperature is 16 °C (61 °F) for evolutionary case 1 and 18 °C (64 °F) for evolutionary case 2. The <b>cooling</b> <b>set</b> point temperature is 26 °C (79 °F) for evolutionary case 1 and 23 °C (73 °F) for evolutionary case 2. The life cycle costs of each case with different insulation levels are calculated based on the initial cost and energy consumption data from EnergyPlus energy modeling software. ^ For all three cases, it was cost effective to insulate exterior walls and roofs. The optimal insulation scenario is 50 mm (2 inches) Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) wall and 25 mm (1 inch) Extruded Polystyrene (XPS) roof for the base case. The best insulation scenarios for evolutionary case 1 and case 2 is 100 mm (3. 9 inches) EPS wall and 75 mm (3 inches) XPS roof and 100 mm (3. 9 inches) EPS wall and 100 mm (3. 9 inches) XPS roof respectively. It has also been found that the determinants on the optimal insulation scenarios are the heating and <b>cooling</b> <b>set</b> point temperatures, energy prices, lifetimes of houses and selected discount rates. ...|$|E

40|$|A measurement-based reduced-order heat {{transfer}} modeling framework is developed to optimize cooling costs of dynamic and virtualized data centers. The reduced-order model {{is based on}} a proper orthogonal decomposition-based model order reduction technique. For data center {{heat transfer}} modeling, the framework simulates air temperatures and CPU temperatures as a parametric response surface with different cooling infrastructure design variables as the input parameters. The parametric framework enables an efficient design optimization tool and is used to solve several important problems related to energy-efficient thermal design of data centers. The first of these problems is about determining optimal response time during emergencies such as power outages in data centers. To solve this problem, transient air temperatures are modeled with time as a parameter. This parametric prediction framework is useful as a near-real-time thermal prognostic tool. The second problem pertains to reducing temperature monitoring cost in data centers. To solve this problem, transient air temperatures are modeled with spatial location as the parameter. This parametric model improves spatial resolution of measured temperature data and thereby reduces sensor requisition for transient temperature monitoring in data centers. The third problem is related to determining optimal <b>cooling</b> <b>set</b> points in response to dynamically-evolving heat loads in a data center. To solve this problem, transient air temperatures are modeled with heat load and time as the parameters. This modeling framework is particularly suitable for life-cycle design of data center cooling infrastructure. The last problem is related to determining optimal <b>cooling</b> <b>set</b> points in response to dynamically-evolving computing workload in a virtualized data center.

40|$|Residential {{consumers}} are educated {{to think about}} their comfort conditioning system as air conditioners and furnaces. Over the past several years the technology of products and controls has been changing. Homes have progressively gotten tighter, new construction and up grading. Equipment capabilities and performance have changed. The ability to control to more precise conditions and for more components of air treatment highlights the need to educate the consumer on the potential available today with adjunct components of the comfort conditioning system. Air conditioners are typically selected for one set of design conditions. In many situations the latent and sensible loads are not the consideration. only total load and first cost. The design conditions are exceeded only 2 1 / 2 % of the time. Therefore, the equipment is typically oversized a majority of the time and not matched properly to the latent load. Air conditioners are, constrained by their physical performance of the components, such as the coils and compressor. As a result. the equipment can not track the wide variety of sensible and latent conditions. The increased use of "set-up" thermostat controls diminish the control of humidity. Air conditioner thermostats sense and respond only to the temperature condition, not to the humidity level. The use of a separate whole house dehumidification system can allow for separate control of the humidity and temperature. The humidity control level is independent of the <b>cooling</b> <b>set</b> point. As a result, the <b>cooling</b> <b>set</b> point can be raised (less air conditioner run time) and comfort enhanced or improved.

The slow <b>cooled</b> <b>setting</b> refers to metabauxite from the Anga metamorphic complex, Lake Baikal. Parameters sensitive to T(C) include the oxygen fractional coordinate (u) and the inversion parameter (i). Experimental equilibration data on the spinel and hercynite end-members and on their solid solution are fitted to equations where T(C) is given its a function of the hercynite content (Hc) of the solid solution and of u or i. The unavoidable simplifications made in this empirical approach are discussed. A reasonable value for T(C), similar to 400 degrees C, was obtained for the slow cooled metamorphic hercynite from the oxygen fractional coordinates. In contrast, an unreasonably high value of T(C) similar to 600 degrees C, was obtained from the inversion parameters. In the case of the last cooled anatectic samples, T(C) calculated from the two structural parameters are comparable; the five crystals show a rang in the calculated values for T(C) over similar to 250 degrees C, from similar to 700 to similar to 950 degrees C, which is reasonable considering the known diversity of cooling rates exhibited by their volcanie host-rocks...|$|R
