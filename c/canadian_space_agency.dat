5|$|McGill's Bellairs Research Institute, {{located in}} Saint James, Barbados , is Canada's only {{teaching}} and research facility in the tropics. The institute has been in use for over 50 years.

5|$|The {{choice of}} Tromsø as a {{location}} for a telemetry stations {{was in part}} tied to the Tromsø Geophysical Observatory—which had been located in Tromsø since 1928—and the planned University of Tromsø. The <b>Canadian</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> was at the time working on the Alouette 2 program and were seen by NDRE as a natural cooperation partner. The NASA's International Satellite for Ionospheric Studies was also being designed and NASA therefore decided to supply equipment for a telemetry station in Tromsø to be operational by August 1966.|$|E
50|$|The MSS was {{designed}} and manufactured by MDA Space Missions (previously called MD Robotics; previously called SPAR Aerospace) for the <b>Canadian</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency's</b> contribution to the International Space Station.|$|R

5000|$|After its decommissioning, Endeavour's Canadarm (formally the 'Shuttle Remote Manipulator System') {{was removed}} {{in order to}} be sent to the <b>Canadian</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency’s</b> John H. Chapman Space Centre in Longueuil, Quebec, a suburb of Montreal, where it was to be placed on display. [...] In a Canadian poll on which science or {{aerospace}} museum should be selected to display the Canadarm, originally built by SPAR Aerospace, the <b>Canadian</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency’s</b> headquarters placed third to last with only 35 out of 638 votes.

5|$|The {{headquarters}} of the <b>Canadian</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> is in Longueuil, southeast of Montreal.

5|$|Chris Hadfield, a <b>Canadian</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> {{astronaut}} and STS-74 mission specialist, {{used the}} shuttle's robot arm to hoist the docking module {{out of the}} aft portion of the payload bay, rotated it to a vertical position, and moved it to within five inches of the Orbiter Docking System. At that point, the shuttle fired its downward steering jets and moved the shuttle toward the docking module. Once the two spacecraft were locked together, the docking ring on the Orbiter Docking System retracted, {{and a series of}} hooks and latches were engaged to ensure an airtight seal between the two spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{proposed}} in 1965, {{the station was}} established by the Royal Norwegian Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (NTNF) in 1967 in close cooperation with the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (NDRE) and located adjacent to Tromsø Geophysical Observatory. From its inception until 1974, it served low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites operated by the European Space Research Organization (ESRO). To a lesser extent it was also used by <b>Canadian</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) LEO satellites. Norway's non-membership in ESRO and later the European Space Agency (ESA) caused Tromsø to not become a ground station for Landsat. A gradual increase in operations occurred from 1982, such as for the International Cospas-Sarsat Programme and the European Remote-Sensing Satellite. TSS became part of NSC in 1990, although it was partially sold to the Swedish Space Corporation (SSC) in 1995. SvalSat merged with TSS in 2002 to form KSAT.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Canadian</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> {{operates}} a highly active space program, conducting deep-space, planetary, and aviation research, and developing rockets and satellites. Canada {{was the third}} country to design and construct a satellite after the Soviet Union and the United States, with the 1962 Alouette 1 launch. Canada is {{a participant in the}} International Space Station (ISS), and is a pioneer in space robotics, having constructed the Canadarm, Canadarm2 and Dextre robotic manipulators for the ISS and NASA's Space Shuttle. Since the 1960s, Canada's aerospace industry has designed and built numerous marques of satellite, including Radarsat-1 and 2, ISIS and MOST. Canada has also produced one of the world's most successful and widely used sounding rockets, the Black Brant; over 1,000 Black Brants have been launched since the rocket's introduction in 1961. In 1984, Marc Garneau became Canada's first male astronaut, followed by Canada's second and first female astronaut Roberta Bondar in 1992.|$|E
5|$|Plans for a Hubble {{successor}} materialized as the Next Generation Space Telescope project, which {{culminated in}} {{plans for the}} James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the formal successor of Hubble. Very different from a scaled-up Hubble, {{it is designed to}} operate colder and farther away from the Earth at the L2 Lagrangian point, where thermal and optical interference from the Earth and Moon are lessened. It is not engineered to be fully serviceable (such as replaceable instruments), but the design includes a docking ring to enable visits from other spacecraft. A main scientific goal of JWST is to observe the most distant objects in the universe, beyond the reach of existing instruments. It is expected to detect stars in the early Universe approximately 280 million years older than stars HST now detects. The telescope is an international collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency, and the <b>Canadian</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> since 1996, and is planned for launch on an Ariane 5 rocket. Although JWST is primarily an infrared instrument, its coverage extends down to 600nm wavelength light, or roughly orange in the visible spectrum. A typical human eye can see to about 750nm wavelength light, so there is some overlap with the longest visible wavelength bands, including orange and red light.|$|E
5|$|The International Space Station (ISS) {{combines}} NASA's Space Station Freedom {{project with}} the Soviet/Russian Mir-2 station, the European Columbus station, and the Japanese Kibō laboratory module. NASA originally planned in the 1980s to develop Freedom alone, but US budget constraints {{led to the}} merger of these projects into a single multi-national program in 1993, managed by NASA, the Russian Federal Space Agency (RKA), the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the European Space Agency (ESA), and the <b>Canadian</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> (CSA). The station consists of pressurized modules, external trusses, solar arrays and other components, which have been launched by Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets, and the US Space Shuttles. It is currently being assembled in Low Earth Orbit. The on-orbit assembly began in 1998, {{the completion of the}} US Orbital Segment occurred in 2011 and the completion of the Russian Orbital Segment is expected by 2016. The ownership and use of the space station is established in intergovernmental treaties and agreements which divide the station into two areas and allow Russia to retain full ownership of the Russian Orbital Segment (with the exception of Zarya), with the US Orbital Segment allocated between the other international partners.|$|E

25|$|Side looking {{airborne}} radar (SLAR) {{made it possible}} to acquire images regardless of weather conditions. On November 4, 1995, Canada launched RADARSAT-1. Developed by the <b>Canadian</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency,</b> it provides images of Earth for scientific and commercial purposes. This system was the first to use synthetic aperture radar (SAR), which sends microwave energy to the ocean surface and records the reflections to track icebergs. The European Space Agency launched ENVISAT (an observation satellite that orbits the Earth's poles) on March 1, 2002. ENVISAT employs advanced synthetic aperture radar (ASAR) technology, which can detect changes in surface height accurately. The <b>Canadian</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> launched RADARSAT-2 in December 2007, which uses SAR and multi-polarization modes and follows the same orbit path as RADARSAT-1.|$|E
