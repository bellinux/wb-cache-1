5|$|Each engine main {{combustion}} chamber (MCC) receives fuel-rich hot gas from a hot-gas manifold <b>cooling</b> <b>circuit.</b> The gaseous hydrogen and liquid oxygen enter the chamber at the injector, which mixes the propellants. A small augmented-spark igniter-chamber {{is located in}} the center of the injector, and this dual-redundant igniter is used during the engine start sequence to initiate combustion. The igniters are turned off after approximately three seconds because the combustion process is self-sustaining. The main injector and dome assembly are welded to the hot-gas manifold, and the MCC is also bolted to the hot-gas manifold. The MCC comprises a structural shell made of Inconel 718 which is lined with a copper-silver-zirconium alloy called NARloy-Z, developed specifically for the RS-25 in the 1970s. Around 390 channels are machined into the liner wall to carry liquid hydrogen through the liner to provide MCC cooling, as the temperature in the {{combustion chamber}} reaches 3300°C (6000°F) during flight – higher than the boiling point of iron.|$|E
25|$|In {{the event}} of an emergency, safety valves can be used to prevent pipes from {{bursting}} or the reactor from exploding. The valves are designed so that they can derive all of the supplied flow rates with little increase in pressure. In the case of the BWR, the steam is directed into the suppression chamber and condenses there. The chambers on a heat exchanger are connected to the intermediate <b>cooling</b> <b>circuit.</b>|$|E
25|$|With the CP0 and CP1 designs, two {{reactors}} {{share the}} same machine and command room. With the CP2 design, each reactor has its own machine and command room. Apart from this difference, CP1 and CP2 use the same technologies, and the two types are frequently referred to as CPY. Compared to CP0 they have an additional <b>cooling</b> <b>circuit</b> between the emergency system that {{in case of an}} accident allows to spray water into the containment and the circuit which contains river water, a more flexible control system and some minor difference in the layout of the building.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the very}} high power levels involved, large lamps are water-cooled. In those used in IMAX projectors, the {{electrode}} bodies are made from solid Invar and tipped with thoriated tungsten. An O-ring seals off the tube, so that the naked electrodes do not contact the water. In low power applications the electrodes are too cold for efficient electron emission and are not cooled; in high power applications an additional water <b>cooling</b> <b>circuit</b> for each electrode is necessary. To save costs, the water circuits are often not separated and the water needs to be deionized to make it electrically non-conductive, which, in turn, lets the quartz or some laser media dissolve into the water.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, Trenchant {{experienced}} a steam leak, forcing {{the crew to}} shut down the nuclear reactor. In 2000 a leak in the PWR1 reactor primary <b>cooling</b> <b>circuit</b> was discovered on Tireless, forcing her to proceed to Gibraltar on diesel power. The fault was found to be due to thermal fatigue cracks, requiring the other Trafalgar-class boats, and some of the remaining Swiftsure-class boats, to be urgently inspected and if necessary modified. In August 2000 it was revealed that with Tireless still at Gibraltar, Torbay, Turbulent, Trenchant and Talent were at Devonport for refit or repair and with Trafalgar undergoing sea trials, only one boat, Triumph, was fully operational. By 2005, refits had reportedly corrected these problems.|$|E

50|$|Sodium {{molybdate}} {{has been}} used in industrial water treatment as a corrosion inhibitor. It was initially thought {{that it would be a}} good replacement for chromate, when chromate was banned for toxicity.

40|$|Water {{use in a}} {{power station}} is an irreplaceable {{resource}} due to its physical and chemical properties, good availability and abundance. That {{is why it is}} used in large volumes for many purposes. Despite the simplicity of water, it is very comprehensive in energy chemistry. Hence if you evaluate the variables in power plants, the second highest variable cost is water. All other types of variable costs are negligible against water. The largest portion of water in power plants is used for refilling <b>cooling</b> <b>circuits.</b> However the largest portion of water added to the <b>cooling</b> <b>circuits</b> (approximately two thirds) is lost to evaporation and is carried over in cooling towers. There is a concentration of water (evaporation) and carry over (drift of small droplets of cooling water in a stream of cooling air). The concentration of water leads to increased concentrations of impurities in the water. Effect of thickening and loss of water is one of the aspects that are discussed in this work...|$|R

As described in Unmanned Systems Technology Magazine, [...] "SPARCS uses a sealed rotor <b>cooling</b> <b>circuit</b> {{consisting of a}} circulating centrifugal fan and a heat exchanger to reject the heat.

2500|$|Near {{isothermal}} compression (and expansion) {{is a process}} in which air is compressed in very close proximity to a large incompressible thermal mass such as a heat absorbing and releasing structure (HARS) or a water spray. A HARS is usually made up of a series of parallel fins. As the air is compressed the heat of compression is rapidly transferred to the thermal mass, so the gas temperature is stabilised. An external <b>cooling</b> <b>circuit</b> is then used to maintain the temperature of the thermal mass.|$|E
2500|$|The reactor has two {{independent}} cooling circuits, each having four main circulating pumps (three operating, one standby). The cooling water is fed to the reactor through lower water lines {{to a common}} pressure header (one for each <b>cooling</b> <b>circuit),</b> which is split to 22 group distribution headers, each feeding 38–41 pressure channels through the core, where the feedwater boils. The mixture of steam and water {{is led by the}} upper steam lines, one for each pressure channel, from the reactor top to the steam separators, pairs of thick horizontal drums located in side compartments above the reactor top; each has [...] diameter, [...] length, wall thickness of , and weighs [...] Steam, with steam quality of about 15%, is taken {{from the top of the}} separators by two steam collectors per separator, combined, and led to two turbogenerators in the turbine hall, then to condensers, reheated to , and pumped by the condensate pumps to deaerators, where remains of gaseous phase and corrosion-inducing gases are removed. The resulting feedwater is led to the steam separators by feedwater pumps and mixed with water from them at their outlets. From the bottom of the steam separators, the feedwater is led by 12 downpipes (from each separator) to the suction headers of the main circulation pumps, and back into the reactor. There is an ion exchange system included in the loop to remove impurities from the feedwater.|$|E

40|$|The Neutral Beam Injectors (NBIs) of the ITER {{experimental}} {{fusion reactor}} {{are designed to}} accelerate Deuterium negative ions with energy up to 1 MeV and current up to 40 A. The accelerator grids must be designed to operate at high voltages and to withstand high power densities (in the order of some tens of MW m- 2). They must maintain a proper alignment in all the foreseen operating scenarios, {{in order to obtain}} good beam optics, so the thermo-mechanical deformations must be maintained at very low values. Further requirements come from the need of keeping under control the maximum surface temperature in copper. With these requirements, the cooling of the grids represents a significantly critical aspect of the NBI design. Coolant properties have to satisfy high resistivity requirements and to be appropriate for the removal of high heat loads. The <b>cooling</b> <b>circuits</b> must match with the beam optic geometry and the space constrains severely affect the coolant distribution.
