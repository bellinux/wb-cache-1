5|$|On May 28, Bonds passed Ruth, {{hitting his}} 715th career home run to <b>center</b> <b>field</b> off Colorado Rockies pitcher Byung-hyun Kim. The ball was hit an {{estimated}} 445feet (140m) into <b>center</b> <b>field</b> where {{it went through}} the hands of several fans but then fell onto an elevated platform in <b>center</b> <b>field.</b> Then it rolled off the platform where Andrew Morbitzer, a 38-year-old San Francisco resident, caught the ball {{while he was in}} line at a concession stand. Mysteriously, radio broadcaster Dave Flemming's radio play-by-play of the home run went silent just as the ball was hit, apparently from a microphone failure. But the televised version, called by Giants broadcaster Duane Kuiper, was not affected.|$|E
5|$|Two Phillies {{played as}} {{pitchers}} and position players; Harry Felix {{was both a}} pitcher and a third baseman, and Patsy Flaherty played <b>center</b> <b>field</b> in addition to pitching.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} inning, Albert Pujols doubled with two out, and Scott Rolen hit a line drive towards Mueller, who caught {{it to end}} the inning. Morris walked Ramírez and Ortiz {{in the bottom of}} the inning. Varitek then tripled to <b>center</b> <b>field</b> to give the Red Sox a 2–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|Musberger's call, {{dramatic}} as it was, incorrectly implied that Bernie Williams fielded the double in left. Bernie was playing <b>center</b> <b>field</b> at the time. Gerald Williams was {{in left field}} playing the ball and making the late throw back to the infield.|$|E
5|$|On April 15, 1954, the Yankees {{dedicated}} {{a plaque}} to Barrow; the plaque first {{hung on the}} <b>center</b> <b>field</b> wall at Yankee Stadium, near the flagpole and the monuments to Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Miller Huggins.

5|$|A {{black-and-white}} photo of Adenhart {{along with his}} name and number {{was added to the}} <b>center</b> <b>field</b> fence at Angel Stadium. A makeshift shrine, dedicated to Adenhart, was established outside the home plate gates to Angel Stadium. The makeshift shrine was maintained by Angels personnel until its removal in December 2009. The Angels do not have any plans to create a permanent memorial.|$|E
5|$|Although in 2008 Baseball America {{projected}} Venable as an {{every day}} starter for the Padres in 2010, some experts questioned {{whether he would}} be a long-term solution in <b>center</b> <b>field</b> for the team. Venable started the 2009 season with the Padres' Triple-A affiliate, Portland Beavers, but he was recalled by the Padres on June 3. His father, Max, served as the Beavers' hitting coach in 2009. Following the July 5 trade of Scott Hairston to the Oakland Athletics, Venable shared right field with Kyle Blanks. On July 12 against the San Francisco Giants, he had his first home run of the season in his first career four-hit game. Between July 30 and August 5, he homered in five of seven games. In an August 23 game against the St. Louis Cardinals, he was involved in a bench-clearing incident when Albert Pujols thought he threw an elbow while being tagged out. In 2009, he posted 12 home runs and tallied 38 runs batted in (RBI), while defensively 493.2 of his 643 innings were spent in right field and only 117 in <b>center</b> <b>field.</b>|$|E

5|$|As well as {{the main}} scoreboard, the {{ballpark}} has three more LED displays. A display in the left-center field wall is used for showing player introductions, in-game pitching statistics, upcoming batters, and advertisements. LED ribbon boards are installed on the facings of {{each side of the}} upper deck; these are used to display the inning, score, count, player introductions, and advertisements. The stadium's three pitch clocks—part of professional baseball's pace-of-game initiatives implemented in Triple-A and Double-A baseball games in 2015— are located on the straightaway <b>center</b> <b>field</b> wall and {{on each side of the}} backstop.|$|E
5|$|Before Bonds {{made it to}} {{the major}} leagues in Pittsburgh, Pirate fan {{attendance}} was low, with 1984 and 1985 attendance below 10,000 per game for the 81-game home schedule. Bonds made his major league debut on May 30, 1986. In 1986, Bonds led National League (NL) rookies with 16home runs, 48RBI, 36stolen bases and 65walks, but he finished 6th in Rookie of the Year voting. He played <b>center</b> <b>field</b> in 1986, but switched to left field with the arrival of centerfielder Andy Van Slyke in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of the plans for the new ballpark, and prior to the 2008 season, more than $1million in upgrades and repairs were made to Greer Stadium. The improvements, which included a new clubhouse for the Sounds and visiting teams beyond the <b>center</b> <b>field</b> wall, improved field lighting, and improvements to restrooms, walkways, and seating, were made {{in order to keep the}} stadium functional for another three to five years.|$|E

5|$|He {{made his}} major league debut on September 7, 2010, as a pinch hitter for Denard Span, {{striking}} out against Kansas City Royals' pitcher Jesse Chavez. He {{remained in the}} game, replacing Span in <b>center</b> <b>field.</b> He recorded his first major league run batted in (RBI) on September 18, 2010, when he grounded out to score J. J.

5|$|Mike Timlin {{relieved}} Martinez in {{the bottom}} of the eighth inning. He finished with six strikeouts, three hits allowed and retired the last 14batters he faced. The Cardinals avoided a shutout when Walker hit a home run to <b>center</b> <b>field</b> off Foulke in the ninth inning, but Foulke retired the other three batters he faced in the inning to secure the win for the Red Sox 4–1.|$|E
5|$|On August 14, 2015, on {{the road}} against the Colorado Rockies, Kemp became the first player in the Padres' 7,444-game history to hit for the cycle.

He finished with a triple to <b>center</b> <b>field</b> {{in the top of}} the 9th inning, scoring Yangervis Solarte from first. He finished the night 4-for-5.|$|E

5|$|Red Sox closer Foulke came in {{to pitch}} {{the bottom of the}} ninth. Pujols led off the inning by hitting a single through Foulke's legs and into <b>center</b> <b>field.</b> After Foulke induced Rolen into a fly out and struck out Edmonds, Pujols took second base, but no stolen base due to fielder's indifference. Édgar Rentería then hit a ground ball that bounced back to Foulke on the mound. Foulke threw it underhand to Doug Mientkiewicz at first base to end the game, and secure the series.|$|E
5|$|A 1,000-car {{above-ground}} parking garage, {{owned by}} the state, is located south of the stadium's <b>center</b> <b>field</b> entrance on Harrison Street between Fourth and Fifth Avenues. As the garage is used by state employees during the day, game attendees are only {{able to use it}} for evening and weekend games. Other state-owned free parking lots and paid private lots are located in the vicinity. The Metro Transit Authority's Music City Circuit provides bus service to and from a drop-off site at Fifth Avenue North and Harrison Street. Nashville BCycle, the city's bike-share program, has a station at First Tennessee Park.|$|E
5|$|Bonds {{resumed his}} {{march to the}} all-time record early in the 2007 season. After an opening game in which all he had was a first-inning single past third base against a right-shifted infield (immediately {{followed}} by a stolen base and then a base-running misjudgment that got him thrown out at home) and a deep out to left field late in the game, Bonds returned the next day, April 4, with another mission. In his first at-bat of the season's second game at the Giants' AT Park, Bonds hit a Chris Young (of the San Diego Padres) pitch just over the wall {{to the left of}} straightaway <b>center</b> <b>field</b> for career home run 735. This home run put Bonds past the midway point between Ruth and Aaron.|$|E
