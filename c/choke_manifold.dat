These chokes can be fixed or adjustable or a mix of both. The redundancy is needed so that if one choke has to be taken out of service, the flow can be directed through another one.

30|$|The surface {{equipment}} for monitoring surface parameters {{consists of a}} Coriolis flow meter, pressure transducer, P 2, a flow in the <b>choke</b> <b>manifold,</b> and a conductivity sensor. A pressure transducer (P 2) located downstream of the pressure cell and upstream of the Coriolis flow meter, as shown in Fig.  1 b, is {{used to measure the}} pressure in the return mud entering the surface monitoring equipment. The Coriolis flow meter is equipped with Elite flow sensor to provide good measurement sensitivity and stability when measuring multi-phase flow and it has tolerance for drill cuttings. The Coriolis flow meter is installed such that the tube is in the up orientation or flag up position to allow an effective drainage of cuttings and mud from the sensor. The <b>choke</b> <b>manifold</b> consists of three valves: a pressure relief valve installed on the pressure relief loop (line), a needle (or backpressure) valve to adjust backpressure in the downhole pressure in the pressure cell and a manual pressure control valve. In the event of a surge in the pressure cell, a pressure relief valve (PRV), installed upstream of the Coriolis flow meter, diverts flow to the pressure relief (bypass) line. The pressure control and needle valves are mainly used to control the downhole pressure. The conductivity sensor measures the electrolytic conductivity changes in the drilling mud return; however, was not monitored t due the sensor’s incompatibility with drill cuttings.|$|E

40|$|Kick {{tolerance}} {{is a key}} parameter {{to indicate}} whether shut-in operation {{can be carried out}} safely and a proper well killing method should be chosen in well drilling. At present, however, the calculation of kick tolerance in deepwater drilling is not efficient enough. In this paper, a calculation method for volume kick tolerance of deepwater drilling was developed by means of theoretical derivation and example verification. Based on deepwater borehole temperature profile, <b>choke</b> <b>manifold</b> and annulus circulating pressure loss, the calculation model of volume kick tolerance was established under the constraint of the pressure-bearing capacity of the formation at the casing shoe, resistance to internal pressure of casing, blowout preventer (BOP) and choke control. Then, its reliability was verified by using the calculation results of a deepwater well in the South China Sea. It is indicated that the well can be shut in safely and the well killing will be safer if the Engineer's Method is used. The result is in agreement with the measures that were adopted on site. Finally, the newly developed calculation model was compared with those which don't take temperature and pressure loss into account, and the effect of <b>choke</b> <b>manifold,</b> annulus pressure loss and temperature inside wellbore on kick tolerance was analyzed. It is shown that the volume kick tolerance will get smaller if the effect of pressure loss and temperature is not taken into account, and the well killing conditions will be more rigorous. In addition, the technical measures to increase kick tolerance were proposed after the influential laws of pit gain and overflow depth on kick tolerance were analyzed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFractured {{carbonate}} reservoirs {{are susceptible}} to blowout and lost circulation during drilling, which not only restricts drilling speed, but also poses big threat to well control. Moreover, there are few technical means available to reconstruct pressure balance in the borehole. Accordingly, the fine managed pressure drilling {{was used in the}} drilling of Well GS 19 in the Qixia Formation with super-high pressure and narrow density window, which is a success: ① back pressure in the annular spaces will be adjusted to maintain a slightly over-balanced bottom-hole hydraulic pressure, and fluid level in the circulation tank will be kept in a slight dropping state to ensure that natural gas in the formation would not invade into the borehole in a massive volume; ② inlet drilling fluid density will be controlled at around 2. 35  g/cm 3, back pressures in the annular be maintained at 2 – 5  MPa, and bottom-hole pressure equivalent circulation density be controlled at 2. 46 – 2. 52  g/cm 3; ③ during managed pressure drilling operations, if wellhead pressure exceeds or expects to exceed 7  MPa, semi-blind rams will be closed. Fluids will pass through the <b>choke</b> <b>manifold</b> of the rig to the <b>choke</b> <b>manifold</b> specifically for pressure control before entering gas/liquid separators to discharge gas; ④ during tripping back pressure will be kept at less than 5  MPa, volume of injected drilling fluid will be higher than the theoretical volume during tripping out, whereas the volume of returned drilling fluid will be higher than the theoretical volume during the out-tripping. This technique has been applied successfully in the drilling of the Qixia Formation, Liangshan Formation and Longmaxi Formation with a total footage of 216. 60  m, as a good attempt in complicated wells with both blowout and lost circulation risks, which can provide valuable experiences and guidance for handling similar complexities in the future...|$|E
30|$|Based on {{the local}} {{resistance}} computation model for a choke valve and using the flow characteristics of choke valves, we studied {{the relationships between the}} back pressure of a parallel choke assembly and the opening extent of choke valves and developed a model to characterize the pressure regime of the manifold assembly. A comparison of pressure characteristic curves shows that a parallel <b>choke</b> <b>manifold</b> assembly has obvious advantages over the conventional serial type including high linearity of pressure-regulating characteristics curves, the elimination of the overshoot interval, wider effective regulating interval and the higher system security. Laboratory hydraulic experiments have validated the capability of a back pressure control model for the parallel choke assembly to accurately control pressure. This study is of great theoretical and practical significance to further improve the performance of chokes used in managed pressure well drilling.|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringManaged Pressure Drilling (MPD) is a {{relatively}} young technology that has improved some old ideas of Underbalanced Drilling (UBD). According to the IADC, MPD is an “adaptive process used to precisely control the annular pressure profile throughout the wellbore. The goal is to ascertain the downhole pressure environment limits and to manage the annular pressure profile accordingly”. In other words the main aim of MPD is to avoid continuous influx of formation fluids to the surface by maintaining a state of effective overbalance. It’s done by applying surface backpressure during drilling ahead or shut-in to make a connection of jointed pipe. Basic tools required to conduct MPD are: a rotating control device (RCD), drillstring non-return valves and dedicated <b>choke</b> <b>manifold.</b> MPD allows drilling through the un-drillable in conventional way formations, helps to reduce non productive time (NPT) and to overcome several drilling problems like: drilling with narrow “pressure window” and kick-loss scenarios caused by narrow margins, excessive casing program, low ROP, excessive mud cost caused {{by the loss of}} circulation, failure to reach TD with large enough hole diameter and shallow geohazards both with drilling riserless and with casing or marine riser. This technology enables manage pressures through the wellbore in more precise way than conventional drilling and there are several strong indicators that MPD in marine environments will be a breakthrough technology in offshore industry in the next years. It’s a big chance for MPD to be best solution for drilling in reservoirs with narrow pressure window, drilling with troublesome zones, depleted reservoirs, HP/HT reservoirs and to overcome almost all offshore drilling-related challenges. Therefore the main objective of this Master’s Thesis is to evaluate both technical and economical feasibility of using Managed Pressure Drilling technology from a floating drilling rig on the Skarv/Idun field on the NCS. Furthermore to show which MPD variation is most suitable on this field, equipment needed to conduct MPD operations, evaluates reservoir and drilling related benefits and assess which drilling problems can be avoided using Managed Pressure Drilling technology...|$|E
40|$|Some of {{the most}} {{difficult}} Venezuelan cementing challenges occur when zones with low fracture gradients or lost circulation problems are encountered. As more wells are drilled through depleted reservoirs, these problems are becoming more common. For PDVSA GAS Anaco in Venezuela, managed-pressure drilling (MPD) is of value when drilling through formations of this type, such as Merecure and San Juan sands in the San Joaquin field. MPD demonstrates its value by minimizing the loss of expensive oil-based mud and by increasing the typical drilling penetration rates up to three-fold. Formation damage may be further minimized when cementing these production strings with special zonal isolation procedures and cementing materials. With MPD, the intent is to apply proven underbalanced (UB) drilling technology and tools to precisely manage and control the annular fluid pressures safely within the wellbore to fit the given mud window. Before cementing, the well is typically close to balanced or slightly underbalanced and must be controlled with a UB <b>choke</b> <b>manifold.</b> The cementing fluid densities and pumping rates are designed so {{that at the end of}} the job, the resulting equivalent circulating density (ECD) is also near-balanced or slightly underbalanced. The liner hanger packer is set as soon as possible after checking the valves on the cementing float system to reduce the time any gas could migrate up through this specially designed new light or ultra-lightweight cement system. With these new light and ultra-lightweight cementing techniques, MPD-drilled wells can now be cemented with minimal formation damage, providing useful zonal isolation when subsequent well intervention is required. PDVSA Anaco is committed to continuing to drill MPD wells in San Joaquin. This paper will present the G- 92 well case study showing the effectiveness of the new 10 ppg lightweight cement for this particular 7 -in. liner job. The liner was cemented at 9, 304 ft with a final equivalent gradient of 0. 5449 psi/ft...|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} part of the remaining oil and gas resources are present in harsh offshore environments and depleted reservoirs that are challenging to reach with conventional drilling methods. An ever increasing energy demand forces the drilling industry to develop new techniques, to be able drill in these environments and to improve the efficiency of operations to make uncommercial prospects feasible. Drilling in deep-water and depleted reservoirs are limited by a narrow margin between the fracture and the pore pressure gradients. This requires an accurate control of the pressure in the wellbore. Managed pressure drilling (MPD) represents various techniques to control the pressure in the wellbore developed to meet the challenging demand in the industry. These methods introduces a closed pressurized system where the downhole pressure can be controlled by a <b>choke</b> <b>manifold.</b> In addition to narrow drilling window, drilling from a floating rig is challenged by surge and swab pressures in the wellbore due to the heave motion of the drilling rig. These pressure fluctuations are challenging to control during connections when the drillstring is suspended in slips and follows the movement of the rig. Pressure variations, caused by surge and swab, may become so large, dependent on amplitude of heave and length of wellbore, among other factors, that it will be impossible to keep inside the pressure window between the pore pressure and fracture pressure. This calls for alternative methods to be able to attain the desired depth of a well in such conditions. The work on this master`s thesis has been to build a model of a bore hole, sufficiently realistic to investigate the opportunity to utilize a Constant Bottom Hole Pressure (CBHP) MPD method on a floating drilling rig subjected to heave. The bottom hole pressure is kept constant by the use of choke and back-pressure pump, controlled by a control system. The control system utilizes pressure and flow data from the model to calculate the needed back pressure. Most of the work, represented in this thesis is, however, a hydraulic model for the system, including simulations of pressure and flow variations during heave, and corresponding surge and swab pressures. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} part of the world's remaining oil and gas prospects are challenging or impossible to reach by conventional methods. Examples are deep-water environments and depleted reservoirs with a narrow drilling window, requiering a more accurate control of the downhole pressure to be able to conduct the drilling operation as safe and efficient as possible. The Constant Bottomhole Pressure (CBHP) variation of Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) addresses the challenges of drilling within a narrow drilling window by controlling the wellbore pressure by use of backpressure from surface and a <b>choke</b> <b>manifold.</b> It has been applied both onshore and offshore, but mainly from fixed platforms in offshore environment. However, some applications have been run also from floating drilling rigs in calm waters, whereas no MPD solution is available for North Sea conditions with severe heave motions. This thesis addresses the challenges of downhole pressure fluctuations related to heave motion when drilling from a floating rig in rough environments during connections. By reconstructing such conditions in lab scale, a new developed control algorithm is to be tested to reduce the downhole pressure variations as much as possible. It is desired to obtain new information to continue the research and {{to come up with a}} solution for heave compensation during MPD floating rigs. This thesis presents the design of the MPD Heave Rig and functional specification of the components in the lab scaled model. The purpose of the model is to simulate the heave motion by moving a pipe up and down in a hole to obtain pressure fluctuations in the hole and apply a control system which controls these pressure variations based on the principles of constant bottomhole pressure MPD. By use of a water pump and a choke, the pressure variations in the hole are compensated for by adjusting the choke opening. A 900 meter long copper pipe is implemented in the model to simulate the time delay of a pressure transient traveling from the surface to the bottom of the well. A tailored system for the choke to be controlled by the control system has been developed and tested for a temporary prediction of the choke characteristics. A plan for further testing of technical components and parameters for the hydraulic model is presented for future work with the rig. It has been conducted a risk assessment considering the whole process of building, testing and running experiments. Measures are implemented and suggested to ensure operational and technical safety of people and equipment involved in the MPD Heave Rig project. </p...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the topic of}} nonlinear estimation and its applications. Particular emphasis is given to downhole pressure estimation for Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD), but due to the mathematical similarities of the two problems, velocity estimation for mechanical systems is also considered.   The thesis consists of the following three parts:Part I of this thesis {{addresses the}} problem of pressure estimation for MPD systems. Over the last decade MPD {{has emerged as a}} tool for drilling offshore wells with tight pressure margins. Several technologies for MPD have been developed and this thesis focuses on the so called constant bottomhole pressure variation. This version of MPD aims at keeping the pressure at one location in the annulus section of a well constant by applying back-pressure {{through the use of a}} <b>choke</b> <b>manifold</b> at the rig. As the pressure profile in the well is not measured, a key element of any control system (manual or automatic) is some sort of estimation scheme for the pressure in the well. To aid in control design for MPD systems, and to solve the pressure estimation problem, a fit for purpose low order model has been developed. Using data from offshore wells, and dedicated experiments onshore, it is demonstrated that the model captures the dominant pressure dynamics. It is also demonstrated that a newly developed adaptive observer, combined with a recursive least squares parameter identification scheme, is able to predict the downhole pressure in the presence of significant parametric uncertainties. Part II of this thesis addresses the problem of adaptive observer design for a class of nonlinear systems including the drilling model. To estimate unmeasured states, in dynamical systems with parametric uncertainties, one can use adaptive observers. Furthermore, if the system is sufficiently (persistently) excited, adaptive observers can be used to identify uncertain parameters. The current state of the art in adaptive observer design does not cover the class of systems to which the drilling model belongs. Motivated by this, a method for adaptive observer design for this class of systems is developed. The method guarantees stability and convergence of the state estimate without requiring persistent excitation. Another weakness with the current state of the art is that existing Lyapunov based adaptive laws have poor parameter identification properties, and can be very hard to tune, when estimating more than one parameter. This motivated the developement of an adaptive observer design that uses multiple delayed observers to improve the convergence rate of the estimation scheme, at the cost of an increased computational burden. In particular, explicit lower bounds on the convergence rate of the state and parameter estimation error are given, and, if the original non-adaptive observer has tunable convergence rate, the redesigned adaptive observer will have tunable convergence rate as well. Part III of this thesis addresses the topic of observer-based output feedback control of general Euler-Lagrange systems. The design of a globally stabilizing output (position) feedback tracking controller for general Euler-Lagrange systems has been an active field of research for at least two decades. Still, it was not until recently that a globally convergent velocity observer was developed. In part III of this thesis a significant obstacle in the development of a  constructive observer design is removed yielding a constructive speed observer design with global performance guarantees. In addition, a separation principle is proven, guaranteeing global stability and convergence when the observer is used in conjunction with certain types of certainty equivalence controllers. To the best of the authors knowledge this represents the first  observer-based output feedback tracking control solution that guarantees a global region of attraction for general Euler-Lagrange systems. </p...|$|E
