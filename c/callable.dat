25|$|Callability — Some bonds {{give the}} issuer {{the right to}} repay the bond before the {{maturity}} date on the call dates; see call option. These bonds {{are referred to as}} <b>callable</b> bonds. Most <b>callable</b> bonds allow the issuer to repay the bond at par. With some bonds, the issuer has to pay a premium, the so-called call premium. This is mainly the case for high-yield bonds. These have very strict covenants, restricting the issuer in its operations. To be free from these covenants, the issuer can repay the bonds early, but only at a high cost.|$|E
25|$|Yield to worst (YTW): when a bond is <b>callable,</b> puttable, exchangeable, or {{has other}} features, the yield to worst {{is the lowest}} yield of yield to maturity, yield to call, yield to put, and others.|$|E
25|$|Yield to call (YTC): when a bond is <b>callable</b> (can be repurchased by {{the issuer}} before the maturity), the market looks {{also to the}} Yield to call, {{which is the same}} {{calculation}} of the YTM, but assumes that the bond will be called, so the cashflow is shortened.|$|E
25|$|Many choices, or {{embedded}} options, {{have traditionally}} been included in bond contracts. For example, many bonds are convertible into common stock at the buyer's option, or may be called (bought back) at specified prices at the issuer's option. Mortgage borrowers have long had the option to repay the loan early, which corresponds to a <b>callable</b> bond option.|$|E
25|$|In October 2008, {{the media}} {{reported}} that Buffett {{had agreed to}} buy General Electric (GE) preferred stock. The operation included special incentives: He received an option to buy threebillion shares of GE stock, at $22.25, over the five years following the agreement, and Buffett also received a 10% dividend (<b>callable</b> within three years). In February 2009, Buffett sold some Procter & Gamble Co. and Johnson & Johnson shares from his personal portfolio.|$|E
25|$|Some {{bonds are}} <b>callable,</b> meaning {{that even though}} the company has agreed to make {{payments}} plus interest towards the debt for a certain period of time, the company can choose to pay off the bond early. This creates reinvestment risk, meaning the investor is forced to find a new place for their money, and the investor {{might not be able to}} find as good a deal, especially because this usually happens when interest rates are falling.|$|E
500|$|During the Civil War, Cooke & Company sold {{hundreds}} of millions of dollars in Union government bonds. [...] Its reputation among investors around the world enabled the bank to sell these bonds when other brokerages could not. [...] Secretary of the Treasury Salmon Chase asked Cooke to try to sell the government's new $500million issue of 5-20 bonds. [...] These paid six percent interest (in gold) and matured in 20 years, but were <b>callable</b> in five years. [...] Cooke used numerous agents from a variety of professions—small bankers, insurance agents, and real estate professionals—to sell these bonds to support the Union war effort. Cooke & Company's innovative use of the telegraph to confirm sales allowed selling throughout the country to be coordinated in Philadelphia.|$|E

2500|$|Corporations may rely on {{borrowed}} funds (debt capital or credit) {{as sources}} of investment to sustain ongoing business operations or to fund future growth. [...] Debt comes in several forms, such as through bank loans, notes payable, or bonds issued to the public. [...] Bonds require the corporations to make regular interest payments (interest expenses) on the borrowed capital until the debt reaches its maturity date, therein the firm must pay back the obligation in full. [...] Debt payments can also {{be made in the}} form of sinking fund provisions, whereby the corporation pays annual installments of the borrowed debt above regular interest charges. [...] Corporations that issue <b>callable</b> bonds are entitled to pay back the obligation in full whenever the company feels it is in their best interest to pay off the debt payments. [...] If interest expenses cannot be made by the corporation through cash payments, the firm may also use collateral assets as a form of repaying their debt obligations (or through the process of liquidation).|$|E
2500|$|Cooke's own {{firm was}} so {{successful}} in distributing Treasury notes that Chase engaged him as special agent to sell the $500 million in [...] "five-twenty" [...] bonds — <b>callable</b> in five years and matured in 20 years — authorized by Congress on February 25, 1862. The Treasury had previously {{tried and failed to}} sell these bonds. Promised a sales commission of 0.5 percent of the revenue from the first $10 million, and 0.375 percent of subsequent bonds, Cooke financed a nationwide sales campaign, appointing about 2,500 sub-agents who traveled through every northern and western state and territory, as well as the Southern states as they came under control of the Union Army. Meanwhile, Cooke secured the support of most Northern newspapers, purchasing ads through advertising agencies, and often working directly with editors on lengthy articles about the virtues of buying government bonds. These efforts heralded a particular type of patriotism based on classical liberalist notions of self-interest. His editorials, articles, handbills, circulars, and signs most often appealed to Americans' desire to turn a profit, while simultaneously aiding the war effort. Cooke quickly sold the $500 million in bonds, and $11 million more. Congress immediately sanctioned the excess.|$|E
6000|$|Shelley's {{happiness}} {{in his home}} had been wounded and bruised almost to death, fifthly, because Harriet narrowly watched a surgical operation which was being performed upon her child, and, [...] "to the astonishment of the operator," [...] who was watching Harriet instead of attending to his operation, she betrayed [...] "not the smallest sign of emotion." [...] The author of this biography was not ashamed to set down that exultant slander. He was apparently not aware {{that it was a}} small business to bring into his court a witness whose name he does not know, and whose character and veracity there is none to vouch for, and allow him to strike this blow at the mother-heart of this friendless girl. The biographer says, [...] "We may not infer from this that Harriet did not feel"--why put it in, then?--"but we learn that those about her could believe her to be hard and insensible." [...] Who were those who were about her? Her husband? He hated her now, because he was in love elsewhere. Her sister? Of course that is not charged. Peacock? Peacock does not testify. The wet-nurse? She does not testify. If any others were there we have no mention of them. [...] "Those about her" [...] are reduced to one person--her husband. Who reports the circumstance? It is Hogg. Perhaps he was there--we do not know. But if he was, he still got his information at second-hand, as it was the operator who noticed Harriet's lack of emotion, not himself. Hogg is not given to saying kind things when Harriet is his subject. He may have said them the time that he tried to tempt her to soil her honor, but after that he mentions her usually with a sneer. [...] "Among those who were about her" [...] was one witness well equipped to silence all tongues, abolish all doubts, set our minds at rest; one witness, not called, and not <b>callable,</b> whose evidence, if we could but get it, would outweigh the oaths of whole battalions of hostile Hoggs and nameless surgeons--the baby. I wish we had the baby's testimony; and yet if we had it it would not do us any good--a furtive conjecture, a sly insinuation, a pious [...] "if" [...] or two, would be smuggled in, here and there, with a solemn air of judicial investigation, and its positiveness would wilt into dubiety.|$|E

50|$|CBBC has {{two types}} of {{contract}}s, <b>callable</b> bull contract and <b>callable</b> bear contract, which are always issued in the money. By investing in a <b>callable</b> bull contract, investors are bullish on {{the prospect of the}} underlying asset and intend to capture its potential price appreciation. Conversely, investors buying a <b>callable</b> bear contract are bearish on the prospect of the underlying asset and try to make a profit in a falling market.|$|E
5000|$|Beyond {{creating}} {{the most basic}} asset, {{it is also possible}} to make assets either divisible or <b>callable.</b> If an asset is made divisible (or <b>callable)</b> upon its initial issuance, it must always be divisible (or <b>callable)</b> with every issuance thereafter. A divisible user-created asset is, like, bitcoin and XCP, divisible up to 8 decimal places. A <b>callable</b> asset is an asset which the issuer can call back (i.e. repurchase) from its owners at a date (...) and for a price (...) specified at the initial issuance.|$|E
