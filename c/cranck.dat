40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to {{incorporate}} a refined hysteresis model, viz. a vector Preisach model, in 2 D magnetic field computations. To this end the governing Maxwell equations are rewritten in a suitable way, which allows to take into account the proper magnetic material parameters and, moreover, to pass to a variational formulation. The variational problem is solved numerically by a FE approximation, using a quadratic mesh, followed by the time discretisation based upon a modified <b>Cranck</b> Nicholson algorithm. The latter includes a suitable iteration procedure to deal with the nonlinear hysteresis behaviour. Finally, the effectiveness of the presented mathematical tool has been confirmed by several numerical experiments. </p...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} {{numerical}} results of energy spectra of photoelectrons emitted by irradiating an hydrogen atom {{with a relatively}} weak single attosecond XUV pulse {{in the presence of}} a two-color IR laser pulse. The densities of probabilities have been obtained by treating the interaction of the atom with the XUV radiation at the first order of the time-dependent perturbation theory and describing the emitted electron through the Coulomb-Volkov wavefunction. The results of the calculations agree with the ones found by numerically solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. Specifically, we use an algorithm that implements an high precision variant of the <b>Cranck</b> Nicolson integration method and allows to take into account the singularity in the Coulomb potential. Analysis of the spectra obtained for very long pulses show that certain features may be explained in terms of quantum interferences in the time domain...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{effectiveness}} of multi-fluid type heat exchangers, where more than two fluids are involved at the same time, three-fluid, four-fluid and double two-fluid heat exchangers have been studied using various methods. Using general definition of maximum heat transfer rate, which {{can be considered as}} a single definition of Qmax, the single effectiveness of multi-fluid heat exchangers can be developed. The maximum heat transfer rate （Qmax） depends on heat capacity rate of each fluid and theirs initial temperatures. It is found that effectiveness is strongly depended on the variables such as flow arrangement, initial temperature, number of heat transfer unit, and fluid properties as well. The optimum heat exchanger and flow arrangement in all cases is determinate by numerical analysis using and comparing different mathematical methods, like LMTD method, NTU method, Runge-Kutta Method or <b>Cranck</b> Nicholson method. It is seen that the best heat exchanger depends on variables such as ratios of initial medium temperatures, length, and fluid properties as well. In this paper, only plate heat exchangers are studied, leaving apart tubular heat exchangers...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{calculate}} the effective diffusion coefficient based on experimentally recorded drying curves for two masonry clays obtained from different localities. The calculation method and two computer programs based on the mathematical calculation of the second Fick’s law and <b>Cranck</b> diffusion equation were developed. Masonry product shrinkage during drying was taken into consideration for the first time and the appropriate correction was entered into the calculation. The results presented in this paper show that the values of the effective diffusion coefficient determined by the designed computer programs (with and without the correction for shrinkage) have similar values to those available in the literature for the same coefficient for different clays. Based on the mathematically determined prognostic value of the effective diffusion coefficient, it was concluded that, whatever the initial mineralogical composition of the clay, there is 90 % agreement of the calculated prognostic drying curves with the experimentally recorded ones. When a shrinkage correction of the masonry products is introduced into the calculation step, this agreement is even better...|$|E
