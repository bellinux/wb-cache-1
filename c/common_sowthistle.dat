40|$|Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) is a {{polyphagous}} pest {{that has a}} relatively strong affinity {{in the field for}} the European weed Sonchus oleraceus L. in parts of Australia. The oviposition preference of H. armigera was examined in relation to sowthistle and some crop hosts on which it is a pest. In a group test with simultaneous exposure of moths to <b>common</b> <b>sowthistle,</b> maize, sorghum and two cotton cultivars, H. armigera females consistently showed strongest affinities for <b>common</b> <b>sowthistle,</b> irrespective of moth age or the original host of the test insects in the field. Females (n = 20) exposed individually to a choice between common sothistle and cotton, varied substantially in preference. Among the females tested, 67 % showed a stronger affinity for <b>common</b> <b>sowthistle,</b> about 5 % preferred cotton and 28 % did not discriminate. <b>Common</b> <b>sowthistle</b> was also the most preferred by newly hatched larvae among the five host plant types presented in a multiple choice test. Larvae fed on <b>common</b> <b>sowthistle</b> flowers had a higher survival rate and body weight than those fed on cotton flowers.

40|$|The cotton {{bollworm}} (Helicoverpa armigera) prefers the <b>common</b> <b>sowthistle</b> (Sonchus oleraceus L.) to cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) for oviposition {{in the field}} in Australia. Using the <b>common</b> <b>sowthistle</b> and cotton as host plants, we carried out this study to evaluate genetic variation in both oviposition preference and larval growth and genetic correlation between maternal preference and larval performance. There was a significant genetic component of phenotypic variation in both characters, and the heritability of oviposition preference was estimated as 0. 602. Helicoverpa armigera larvae survived slightly better and grew significantly faster on <b>common</b> <b>sowthistle</b> than on cotton, but genetic correlation between maternal preference and larval growth performance was not detectable. Instead, larval growth performance on the two hosts changed with families, which renders the interaction between family and host plant significant. As a result, the genetic correlation between mean values of larval growth across the two host species was not different from zero.

40|$|Summary Glyphosate {{resistance}} {{is becoming a}} common problem in farming systems of the sub-tropical cropping region of Australia. Glyphosate-resistance has been confirmed in awnless barnyard grass (Echinochloa colona L. (Link)), liverseed grass (Urochloa panicoides P. Beauv.), flaxleaf fleabane (Conyza bonariensis (L.) Cronquist), windmill grass (Chloris truncata R. Br.) and annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum (Gaud.)) (Preston 2012). As well, <b>common</b> <b>sowthistle</b> (Sonchus oleraceus L.) was identified {{at high risk of}} developing glyphosate resistance. To prevent further glyphosate resistance and to improve management of existing glyphosate resistant populations, alternative management tactics for these key weeds are required.

40|$|<b>Common</b> <b>sowthistle</b> (Sonchus oleraceus) {{is a major}} weed of {{conservation}} tillage systems in Australia. The major problem associated with the weed is that it reduces stored soil moisture in fallow, impacting the subsequent crop. Glyphosate has been a reliable control option for the weed, but resistance to glyphosate has now been confirmed in populations growing in the northern cropping region of Australia. To determine how widespread this problem is in the northern cropping region, a survey commenced in 2014 and will conclude in 2016. <b>Common</b> <b>sowthistle</b> seeds have been collected from cropping properties in the region, {{as part of a}} non-targeted sampling approach. Plants were grown to a two to four leaf stage, and then treated with a commercial glyphosate formulation at various rates, to determine the discriminating dose that distinguishes between resistant and susceptible populations. Following determination of this rate, screening tests were performed using field collected seed obtained from cropping properties throughout the region. Close to 20 % of the populations tested have exhibited resistance to glyphosate (i. e. less than 80 % of seedlings were killed by treatment with glyphosate at the discriminating dose). Preliminary results indicate that glyphosate resistant populations are clustered in one location within the region, where long term use {{of conservation}} tillage practices has resulted in reliance on glyphosate for sowthistle control. By determining the geographic extent of glyphosate resistant <b>common</b> <b>sowthistle</b> in the northern region, the results of this survey will assist industry stakeholders to respond with suitable management solutions for the control of this problematic weed...|$|E

In this project, preventive strategies were tested in long term field experiments, and specific tactics were tested in 12 short term trials. The proposed strategies to conserve glyphosate susceptibility involved a variety of chemical and non-chemical alternatives to glyphosate. Findings were communicated to the industry in six newsletters, 61 papers and articles in rural media, and 23 presentations. These strategies have been published in three regional specific brochures...|$|E
40|$|Oviposition {{preference}} and several measures of offspring performance of Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) were investigated on {{a subset of}} its host plants that were selected for their reputed importance {{in the field in}} Australia. They included cotton, pigeon pea, sweet corn, mungbean, bean and <b>common</b> <b>sowthistle.</b> Plants were at their flowering stage when presented to gravid female moths. Flowering pigeon pea evoked far more oviposition than did the other plant species and was the most preferred plant for neonate larval feeding. It also supported development of the most robust larvae and pupae, and these produced the most fecund moths. <b>Common</b> <b>sowthistle</b> and cotton were equally suitable to pigeon pea for larval development, but these two species received far fewer H. armigera eggs than did pigeon pea. Mungbean also received relatively few eggs, but it did support intermediate measures of larval growth and survival. Fewest eggs were laid on bean and it was also the least beneficial in terms of larval growth. Among the host plant species tested, only flowering pigeon pea supported a good relationship between oviposition preference of H. armigera and its subsequent offspring performance. Australian H. armigera moths are thus consistent with Indian H. armigera moths in their ovipositional behaviour and larval performance relative to pigeon pea. The results suggest that the host recognition and acceptance behaviour of this species is fixed across its geographical distribution and they support the theory that pigeon pea might be one of the primary host plants of this insect. These insights, together with published results on the sensory responses of the females to volatiles derived from the different host plant species tested here, help to explain why some plant species are primary targets for the ovipositing moths whereas others are only secondary targets of this polyphagous pest, which has a notoriously broad host range...|$|E
40|$|Harvest weed {{seed control}} (HWSC) {{is a new}} {{approach}} which targets weed seed removal and/or destruction during the crop harvest operation.

In total 1400 transects across 70 paddocks assessed weed distribution, density and seed production at harvest time in wheat, chickpea and sorghum crops. Seventy weed species were identified, of which many had large seed numbers retained at crop harvest.

40|$|As soil metal {{contamination}} {{is rapidly}} increasing worldwide, {{mainly because of}} human activities, phytomanagement of polluted land is becoming an environmentally sustainable and cost-effective option that can also produce biomass and energy as secondary utilities.

40|$|Weed {{control and}} farming system {{practices}} are being assessed {{for their ability}} to reduce the seed banks of weed species that have developed herbicide resistance. In six long-term field experiments in southern Queensland, we are testing a wide variety of management practices to deplete soil seed banks of key annual weed species, such as wild oat, <b>common</b> <b>sowthistle,</b> liverseed grass, barnyard grass and awnless barnyard grass. Irrigation increased the emergence of all species with timing of irrigation being important. Higher stubble levels increased the emergence of larger seeded species including wild oat and awnless barnyard grass, but decreased the emergence of sowthistle. Cultivation reduced emergence of sowthistle and summer grasses, but had little effect on wild oat emergence. The wild oat seed bank was reduced by up to 70 % in the top 5 cm of soil either with or without cultivation. However, cultivation increased the number of wild oat seeds persisting below 5 cm. Data suggest that wetter environments will encourage a more rapid depletion of summer grasses and sowthistle through increased emergence. Similarly, maintaining crop residue may increase seed bank depletion of larger seeded species through increased emergence. Cultivation increases the persistence of all the target species and is not a favoured practice for rapid depletion of the seed bank...|$|E
40|$|No - till {{systems have}} been widely adopted by farmers in Australia {{over the past decade}} to reduce soil erosion, improve soil {{physical}} and chemical properties, conserve soil moisture and save on fuel costs. These changes in tillage practices can have a major influence on the ecology and management of weeds. Studies were undertaken on the seed biology of six important Australian weed species to provide underpinning knowledge of their response to tillage. Field studies were also undertaken to investigate the effect of no - till on weed seedling emergence, seed bank persistence and herbicide behaviour. Seed germination of threehorn bedstraw and wild turnip, the latter only at sub - optimal temperatures, was inhibited by light. In contrast, seed germination of <b>common</b> <b>sowthistle</b> and Indian hedge mustard was stimulated by light. Seed germination of small - flowered mallow was not influenced by the light conditions. Seedling emergence of threehorn bedstraw, wild turnip, small - flowered mallow and annual ryegrass was low on the soil surface but increased with shallow burial, which suggests that farming practices that achieve shallow burial of seeds are likely to promote greater seedling emergence of these weed species. In contrast, seedling emergence of <b>common</b> <b>sowthistle</b> and Indian hedge mustard was greatest for the seeds present on the soil surface and emergence decreased with increased burial depth. In field experiments, low soil disturbance tillage systems left more seeds on the soil surface after crop sowing, whereas high soil disturbance systems buried most of the seeds. Seedling emergence of annual ryegrass, threehorn bedstraw and wild radish was greater under minimum tillage than no - till system. In contrast, seedling emergence of Indian hedge mustard, <b>common</b> <b>sowthistle,</b> silvergrass, small - flowered mallow and turnipweed was greater under the no - till system. Seedling emergence of wild oat and wild turnip was not influenced by the tillage system. Even though seedling emergence of annual ryegrass was much lower under no - till, the persistence of residual viable seeds of annual ryegrass from one season to the next was similar between the tillage systems. This was because of much greater seed decay under no - till (48 to 60 %) than that recorded under minimum tillage (12 to 39 %). All dinitroaniline herbicides (trifluralin, pendimethalin and oryzalin) were more effective in reducing the number of plants, spikes, dry matter and seed production of annual ryegrass when incorporated at sowing with tines than with the discs. At Minlaton in 2004 and 2005, bioavailable trifluralin was greater under tillage systems with greater levels of soil disturbance than under lower soil disturbance systems. In the absence of the herbicide, annual ryegrass was less competitive with wheat under the disc - sown systems. The response of grain yield to herbicides was greater under the tine - sown systems than the disc - sown systems. The performance of S - metolachlor on annual ryegrass control was investigated under no - till. The control of annual ryegrass was greater than 80 % when S - metolachlor was applied at sowing (incorporated by sowing or post - sowing pre - emergence). However, application of the herbicide at sowing resulted in phytotoxic effects on crop emergence and grain yield of wheat. Application of S - metolachlor at 20 or 23 days before sowing not only provided effective control (74 to 83 %) of annual ryegrass, it was also safe on wheat. Application of this herbicide at 40 or 46 days before sowing was relatively ineffective in controlling annual ryegrass (33 to 49 % weed kill) but safe on wheat. In conclusion, soil disturbance caused by tillage was found to have a major influence on the behaviour of the seed bank of different species including seedling emergence and decay rates of weed seeds. However, the response to tillage tended to be species - specific and was related to their seed biology. Tillage systems also had a major influence on the efficacy and bioavailability of trifluralin, which is prone to volatilisation losses. The findings of this research program are expected to contribute to the improvement in weed management under no - till systems. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] School of Agriculture, Food and Wine, 2006...|$|E
40|$|In dryland cotton {{cropping}} systems, {{the main}} weeds {{and effectiveness of}} management practices were identified, and {{the economic impact of}} weeds was estimated using information collected in a postal and a field survey of Southern Queensland and northern New South Wales. Forty-eight completed questionnaires were returned, and 32 paddocks were monitored in early and late summer for weed species and density. The main problem weeds were bladder ketmia (Hibiscus trionum), <b>common</b> <b>sowthistle</b> (Sonchus oleraceus), barnyard grasses (Echinochloa spp.), liverseed grass (Urochloa panicoides) and black bindweed (Fallopia convolvulus), but the relative importance of these differed with crops, fallows and crop rotations. The weed flora was diverse with 54 genera identified in the field survey. Control of weed growth in rotational crops and fallows depended largely on herbicides, particularly glyphosate in fallow and atrazine in sorghum, although effective control was not consistently achieved. Weed control in dryland cotton involved numerous combinations of selective herbicides, several non-selective herbicides, inter-row cultivation and some manual chipping. Despite this, residual weeds were found at 38 - 59 % of initial densities in about 3 -quarters of the survey paddocks. The on-farm financial costs of weeds ranged from $ 148 to 224 /ha. year depending on the rotation, resulting in an estimated annual economic cost of $ 19. 6 million. The approach of managing weed populations across the whole cropping system needs wider adoption to reduce the weed pressure in dryland cotton and the economic impact of weeds in the long term. Strategies that optimise herbicide performance and minimise return of weed seed to the soil are needed. Data from the surveys provide direction for research to improve weed management in this cropping system. The economic framework provides a valuable measure of evaluating likely future returns from technologies or weed management improvements...|$|E
40|$|Sonchus oleraceus (<b>common</b> <b>sowthistle)</b> is a {{dominant}} weed and {{has increased in}} prevalence in conservation cropping systems of the subtropical grain region of Australia. Four experiments were undertaken to define the environmental factors that favor its germination, emergence, and seed persistence. Seeds were germinated at constant temperatures between 5 and 35 C and water potentials between 0 and - 1. 4 MPa. The maximum germination rate of 86 - 100 % occurred at 0 and - 0. 2 MPa, irrespective of the temperature when exposed to light (12 h photoperiod light/dark), but the germination rate was reduced by 72 % without light. At water potentials of - 0. 6 to - 0. 8 MPa, the germination rate was reduced substantially by higher temperatures; no seed germinated at a water potential >- 1. 0 MPa. Emergence and seed persistence were measured over 30 months following seed burial at 0 (surface), 1, 2, 5, and 10 cm depths in large pots that were buried in a south-eastern Queensland field. Seedlings emerged readily from the surface and 1 cm depth, with no emergence from below the 2 cm depth. The seedlings emerged during any season following rain but, predominantly, within 6 months of planting. Seed persistence was short-term on the soil surface, with 2 % of seeds remaining after 6 months, but it increased with the burial depth, with 12 % remaining after 30 months at 10 cm. Thus, a minimal seed burial depth with reduced tillage and increased surface soil water with stubble retention has favored the proliferation of this weed in any season in a subtropical environment. However, diligent management without seed replenishment will greatly reduce this weed problem within a short period...|$|E
40|$|Glyphosate {{resistance}} is a rapidly developing threat to profitability in Australian cotton farming. Resistance causes an immediate {{reduction in the}} effectiveness of in-crop weed control in glyphosate-resistant transgenic cotton and summer fallows. Although strategies for delaying glyphosate resistance and those for managing resistant populations are qualitatively similar, the longer resistance can be delayed, the longer cotton growers will have choice over which tactics to apply and when to apply them. Effective strategies to avoid, delay, and manage resistance are thus of substantial value. We used a model of glyphosate resistance dynamics to perform simulations of resistance evolution in Sonchus oleraceus (<b>common</b> <b>sowthistle)</b> and Echinochloa colona (awnless barnyard grass) under a range of resistance prevention, delaying, and management strategies. From these simulations, we identified several elements that could contribute to effective glyphosate resistance prevention and management strategies. (i) Controlling glyphosate survivors is the most robust approach to delaying or preventing resistance. High-efficacy, high-frequency survivor control almost doubled the useful lifespan of glyphosate from 13 to 25 years even with glyphosate alone used in summer fallows. (ii) Two non-glyphosate tactics in-crop plus two in-summer fallows is the minimum intervention required for long-term delays in resistance evolution. (iii) Pre-emergence herbicides are important, but should be backed up with non-glyphosate knockdowns and strategic tillage; replacing a late-season, pre-emergence herbicide with inter-row tillage was predicted to delay glyphosate resistance by 4 years in awnless barnyard grass. (iv) Weed species 2 ̆ 7 ecological characteristics, particularly seed bank dynamics, {{have an impact on}} the effectiveness of resistance strategies; S. oleraceus, because of its propensity to emerge year-round, was less exposed to selection with glyphosate than E. colona, resulting in an extra 5 years of glyphosate usefulness (18 v. 13 years) even in the most rapid cases of resistance evolution. Delaying tactics are thus available that can provide some or many years of continued glyphosate efficacy. If glyphosate-resistant cotton cropping is to remain profitable in Australian farming systems in the long-term, however, growers must adapt to the probability that they will have to deal with summer weeds that are no longer susceptible to glyphosate. Robust resistance management systems will need to include a diversity of weed control options, used appropriately...|$|E
40|$|Helicoverpa armigera is a {{polyphagous}} pest with {{wide range of}} host plants. This species {{is considered to be}} a generalist with a generalised mechanism for host location and oviposition and this mechanism is seen as the way they expand their host range to suit local plant species availability. The underlying interactions of this pest species with its different host plants have never been fully investigated, perhaps because the insects are seen to be maximizing their fitness opportunistically. Various measures of larval and/or adult performance therefore often take precedence. However, circumstantial evidence suggests that even {{a polyphagous}} herbivore like H. armigera utilises their different host plants differently and some plants are preferred more for oviposition and offspring development. The differential use of hosts is acknowledged, but is usually portrayed as choice, and sequence of choice is sometimes predicted to correlate with larval performance. The research reported in this thesis focuses on the most preferred host species known for H. armigera. The eggs and larvae of the insect occur more regularly on such primary host plant species. The interactions of H. armigera moths with such host plants cannot be explained by the model that focuses on the generalist behaviour. In other words, the underlying mechanism that confers the potential for multiple host use is hidden. In the same context the wide range of host plants listed make it difficult to structure strong scientific tests that relate to host use by H. armigera. By contrast, if such herbivorous insects are adapted to specific environmental circumstances, then specific mechanisms can be expected for placing them precisely within the appropriate environment. Host plant recognition and acceptance is one such adaptation and the host plant species (and there may well be more than one of them) to which the insects species became adapted under selection at the time of speciation must be the primary host plant(s) of the species (Chapter 1). The ecological settings of the primary host plant(s) and the insect species must be similar. Also the insect species must have strong affinity for the plant species in terms of its ovipositional behaviour and offspring development. These interactions of the insect species with its primary host plant(s) can be used as the starting point for understanding the underlying nature of the polyphagous behaviour of the herbivore insect species. In this thesis I propose that H. armigera evolved in relation to primary host plant(s) and predict that its key adaptations to the primary host plant(s) will be similar across the geographical distribution of the species. More specifically I propose pigeon pea might be one of the primary host plants of this insect based on information from Indian H. armigera. If these moths encounter plants that share characteristics (mainly chemical) with these primary host plants they are liable to utilise these plants to some extent, perhaps mostly in the absence of their primary host plants. Such hosts can be termed secondary or incidental host plants. In this way the polyphagy and the invasive potential of H. armigera can be explained in mechanistic physiological and behavioural terms. I first investigated the oviposition preference and offspring performance of Australian subspecies of H. armigera on a subset of its host plants, selected for their reputed relative importance in the field, including cotton, sweet corn, pigeon pea, mungbean, bean, and <b>common</b> <b>sowthistle</b> (Chapter 2). Flowering pigeon pea was the most attractive host for oviposition. Pigeon pea, cotton and <b>common</b> <b>sowthistle</b> are equally suitable for larval feeding although the latter two plant species attract far less oviposition than pigeon pea. Mungbean was less attractive as an ovipositional host but returned intermediate success for larval growth and survival. Bean was the least attractive for oviposition and the least beneficial in terms of larval growth. Oviposition tendencies, larval performance and larval behaviour of Australian H. armigera are consistent on pigeon pea relative to Indian H. armigera. From the evidence available, the host recognition and acceptance behaviour of this species is fixed across geographical populations of H. armigera, at least in relation to pigeon pea, which shows signs of being a primary host species for H. armigera. To investigate which chemical signals female H. armigera moths respond to, headspace volatiles of flowering pigeon pea plants and a subset of other commonly used flowering host plants (tobacco, cotton and common bean) and nonhost plants (lantana and oleander) of H. armigera were screened by gas chromatography (GC) linked to a mated female H. armigera electroantennograph (EAG) (Chapter 3). EAG responses for pigeon pea volatiles were also compared between females of different physiological status (virgin and mated) and across the sexes. Eight electrophysiologically active compounds in pigeon pea headspace were identified in relatively high concentrations using GC linked to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). These included three green leaf volatiles ((2 E) -hexenal, (3 Z) -hexenylacetate and (3 Z) -hexenyl- 2 -methylbutyrate) and five monoterpenes, (á-pinene, â-myrcene, limonene, E-â-ocimene and linalool). (3 Z) -hexenyl- 2 -methylbutyrate was detected only in pigeon pea headspace volatiles, at relatively low levels. The other host plants tested contained smaller subsets of these electrophysiologically active compounds and even the nonhost plants contained some of these compounds, all at relatively lower concentrations than pigeon pea, with some apparently at concentrations lower than that perceivable by the insect antenna. These results explain why pigeon pea is one of the most attractive hosts for oviposition for H. armigera and how the other tested plants can be secondary targets for ovipositing moths. The threshold concentrations at which some of the signature volatile compounds are perceived by moth antennae might be the key factor that dictates the host recognition behaviour of this insect. The physiological status or sex of the moths had no effect on the neurosensory responses for these identified compounds. The complex behavioural decisions thus seem to be controlled by the central nervous system rather than the peripheral senses. The attraction of gravid females of H. armigera for flowering host plants is well documented. Helicoverpa armigera is a nectar feeding moth, hence this attraction might also serve in relation to the adult nutritional requirements of this species. To investigate the underlying physiological needs of H. armigera for nectar feeding, I conducted a series of laboratory experiments, substituting nectar with sucrose solution (Chapter 4). The lifetime complement of oocytes present at the time of adult eclosion is entirely dependent on the food harvested by the larvae. However, the maturation of these oocytes and their subsequent deposition are both dependent to some extent on the incoming adult nutrients. Oviposition rate is directly proportional to the amount of exposure of the moth to carbohydrate food. If females are deprived of carbohydrate during their preovipositional period, subsequent egg maturation and deposition is reduced by 33 %. If females are fed only with water, 40 - 50 % reduction in realized fecundity occurs. If they are deprived of food for their entire life, the reduction is 85 %. Adult nutrients are thus important for the overall sustenance of the moths and enable them to reach their full reproductive potential, which is initially determined by the larval diet. In chapter 4, I discuss the ecological consequences of the importance of adult feeding in this polyphagous pest. Since oviposition of H. armigera moths is strongly associated with flowering plants, I predict this insect, soon after eclosion, searches for host plants with nectar to support their maintenance functions and thus their reproduction. Nectar quality and associated floral volatiles may, therefore, be important factors that influenced the evolutionary association of H. armigera to its primary host plant species. I also investigated the interactions of ovipositing moths and their offspring with pigeon pea through a series of glasshouse and laboratory experiments (Chapter 5). The results show that nectar feeding female H. armigera moths are strongly attracted to the reproductive structures of pigeon pea, especially the flowers. These reproductive structures themselves are the main attraction for gravid females, because deflowered plants no longer attract moths and flowerless plants with fresh flowers attached regain their attraction to some extent. Females feed several times before ovipositing on buds, flowers and immature pods. There appears to be a tight correlation between the neurosensory and physiological adaptations of the ovipositing moths and those of the immature larvae. Immediately upon hatching immature larvae settled on flowers for feeding and at no time they did feed on leaves of pigeon pea. This was true even of larvae from eggs that had been manually placed on lower most leaves. Weight gain and survival of larvae are far greater on a flower diet than a leaf diet. Because the behavioural adaptations of the larvae of H. armigera are very agreeable with their mothers oviposition choice, it seems these two behavioural traits have been shaped closely in relation to one another through evolutionary time. Presumably, the primary host species, pigeon pea, has the entire range of characteristics that attract gravid H. armigera moths when the plant species bear the flowers and pods. The physiological and neurosensory adaptations of the insects to utilise this plant species are consistent across the continents. The secondary hosts used by H. armigera have only some of the characteristics that attract the H. armigera and these hosts are utilised by the insects to some extent, probably when their primary hosts are not readily available. A polyphagous species such as H. armigera does have considerable potential to establish in a new environment and become abundant, if one or more other hosts incidentally match the primary requirements of this insect. The population levels of the insect may depend on the abundance of such hosts in the new environment. For an agricultural pest species such as H. armigera the ephemeral and sequential presence of many incidental or secondary hosts within a cropping season, when climatic factors are appropriate for their optimal development, explains why they are so hard to control...|$|E
