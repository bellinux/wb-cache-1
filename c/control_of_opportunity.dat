40|$|Coral reef {{degradation}} from ship groundings {{and construction}} activities is unfortunately becoming an increasingly common occurrence worldwide, especially in densely populated regions like southeast Florida, U. S. A., where each year {{there are a}} number of coral reef injury events that require mitigation and/or restoration. These activities generally begin with the rescue and reattachment (triage) of scleractinian corals dislodged during the injury event. Because dislodged colony mortality is typically high, colonies may die during legal enforcement action delays. Additionally, natural reef recovery in southeast Florida is typically slow; therefore, transplantation of additional (donor) scleractinian corals into an injured area has been used to restore natural species richness, percent cover, and density, which can accelerate reef recovery. Donor colonies available for transplantation have been grown in situ, grown in laboratories, and taken from uninjured reef areas. An alternative source of donor coral colonies for transplantation is “corals of opportunity,” which I define as scleractinian corals that have been detached from the reef through natural processes or unknown events. My thesis was part of a project, the Coral Nursery Project, initiated in 2001 in Broward County, Florida, U. S. A. that was developed to collect these dislodged colonies and transplant them to a coral nursery. Coral nurseries are interim locations that function as storage sites for corals <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> where they can be cached, stabilized, and allowed to grow until needed as donor colonies for future restoration activities. My thesis utilized a partnership between a local university, county government, and a volunteer dive group. Two hundred fifty-three corals <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> were located, collected, and transported to coral nurseries. Corals <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> were tagged, transplanted to the coral nurseries, and monitored quarterly for survivorship and growth from date of transplantation to February 2004. Survival <b>of</b> corals <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> transplanted to coral nurseries was found to be statistically similar to that <b>of</b> <b>control</b> corals naturally attached to reef, and significantly greater than that <b>of</b> <b>control</b> corals <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> left unattached. Growth rates <b>of</b> <b>control</b> corals naturally attached to reef were similar to that <b>of</b> corals <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> transplanted to coral nurseries. Results provide resource managers with information on the utility of using corals <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> as a source of transplant donor colonies, on coral species- and colony size-specific transplantation success, and on transplanted colony survival and growth. I discuss the value of using coral nurseries as cache sites for corals <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> to be used in future coral reef restoration activities, and provide recommendations for coral nursery characteristics for optimum coral survival, developing community-based restoration projects, and fostering participatory management. However, the ultimate goal of the Coral Nursery Project is to use these rescued corals <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> from this nursery as a source of donor coral transplants in future coral reef restoration activities. Stabilized and healthy transplanted corals <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> from this coral nursery will provide a living resource for coral transplantation during coral reef restoration projects.

40|$|Field {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that personal control over the indoor climate may increase comfort and could reduce SBS symptoms. A laboratory study was performed to investigate if being in control over the thermal environment influences comfort, symptoms and performance. The central hypothesis was that human responses to a thermal indoor environment depend on the availability <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>opportunities.</b> This was tested in a field lab where subjects were had a personal desk fan with a stepless controller at their workplace. Two conditions were tested: one (the first) with individual control and one without, but with identical indoor climate exposure as recorded during the first session. During both experimental conditions, 23 subjects were exposed for 120 min to an operative temperature of 28 °C and they were provided with a personal desk fan. During the first exposure subjects were allowed to adjust air velocity (and therefore local thermal environment) at any moment. For each subject the adjustments were recorded. In the second experiment, subjects were exposed to identical indoor environment conditions as recorded during the first experiment, but without individual <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the desk fan (control knob was hidden). During both conditions identical questionnaires and performance tests were used to evaluate comfort, symptom intensity and performance. Limited differences were found when comparing the ‘with control’ and ‘without control situation’. For the investigated case, the availability <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>opportunities</b> does not directly influence human perception to the thermal environment, symptoms or performance. However, personal preferences for the air velocity of the fan differ a lot. This confirms the need for personal indoor climate systems to satisfy the need of individuals...|$|R

40|$|SARAs {{have been}} {{established}} to achieve dual objectives of improving efficiency and controlling corruption in tax administrations. Key question for this research include: why some SARAs have failed to effectively control opportunities for corruption {{and what should be}} done about it? To explore these questions, this thesis has set out an Anti-Corruption SARA Framework. The novel contribution of this thesis lies in developing the new lens (analytical framework) which causes us to see the topic of SARAs against corruption quite differently (due to differentiating between motivations and opportunities for corruption). In order to analyze the validity of the framework, a two-staged analysis of SARAs, labelled as the macro and micro analysis, was conducted for SARAs and Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) in Pakistan. In the macro level of analysis (through secondary literature analysis), it was found that SARAs made partial progress to control corruption by focusing more on controlling motivations for corruption (through personnel autonomy) and lesser focus on controlling opportunities for corruption (through effective accountability). In the micro analysis (through semi-structured interviews and secondary literature), it was found that FBR remained ineffective in controlling both motivations and opportunities for corruption despite focusing more on controlling motivations for corruption (through personnel autonomy) and lesser focus on controlling opportunities for corruption (through effective accountability). In both macro and micro analyses, continued interference from Ministries of Finance (MoF) was found to undermine not only effective accountability for SARAs and FBR, but also undermining <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunities</b> for corruption. Findings of both macro and macro level of analysis resulted in three main recommendations. These findings pointed towards a recommendation of reforming SARAs into an organizational form which is far more disaggregated from the parent ministry, such that SARAs have no accountability link with MoFs in the presence of other effective oversight bodies. It is recommended that SARA countries should develop this understanding about importance of balancing both autonomy and accountability mechanisms to be fully effective against corruption for controlling both motivations and opportunities for corruption. Thirdly, research findings point towards a case of converting FBR into a SARA in the form of Pakistan Revenue Authority, such that it is free from any direct oversight by the MoF, and in contrast should be subjected to effective oversight by other oversight bodies, such as already existing Cabinet Committee for Federal Revenue...|$|R

40|$|Conflicts {{between the}} sexes over <b>control</b> <b>of</b> {{reproduction}} are thought {{to lead to a}} cost of sexual selection through the evolution of male traits that manipulate female reproductive physiology and behaviour, and female traits that resist this manipulation. Although studies have begun to document negative fitness effects of sexual conflict, studies showing the expected association between sexual conflict and the specific behavioural mechanisms of sexual selection are lacking. Here we experimentally manipulated the opportunity for sexual conflict in the cockroach. Nauphoeta cinerea and showed that, for this species, odour cues in the social environment influence the behavioural strategies and fitness of males and females during sexual selection. Females provided with the opportunity for discriminating between males but not necessarily mating with preferred males produced fewer male offspring than females mated at random. The number of female offspring produced was not affected, nor was the viability of the offspring. Experimental modification of the composition of the males' pheromone showed that the fecundity effects were caused by exposure to the pheromone component that makes males attractive to females but also makes males less likely to be dominant. Female mate choice therefore carries a demographic cost but functions to avoid male manipulation and aggression. Male-male competition appears to function to circumvent mate choice rather than directly manipulating females, as the mate choice can be cryptic. The dynamic struggle {{between the sexes}} for <b>control</b> <b>of</b> mating <b>opportunities</b> and outcomes in N. cinerea therefore reveals a unique role for sexual conflict {{in the evolution of the}} behavioural components of sexual selection...|$|R

50|$|<b>Control</b> <b>of</b> fire against <b>opportunity</b> targets is an {{important}} differentiator between different types of artillery system. In some armies, only designated artillery HQs have the tactical fire control authority to order fire units to engage a target, all 'calls for fire' being requests to these HQs. This authority may also extend to deciding the type and quantity of ammunition to be used. In other armies, an 'authorised observer' (for example, artillery observation team or other target acquisition element) can order fire units to engage. In the latter case, a battery observation team can order fire to their own battery and may be authorised to order fire to their own battalion, and sometimes to many battalions. For example, a divisional artillery commander may authorise selected observers to order fire to the entire divisional artillery. When observers or cells are not authorised, they can still request fire.|$|R
