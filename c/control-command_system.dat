In this setting, numerical simulation of both the plant and the controller plays a crucial role, since it is used to validate the design choices {{in the early stages of}} development. However, classical numerical simulation has inherent limitations: it is of limited precision and cannot deal with the intrinsic non-determinism present in complex systems. In this article, we present a tool named HySon that overcomes these drawbacks. It takes as input a Simulink model of a <b>control-command</b> <b>system</b> with non-deterministic uncertainties and automatically computes flow-pipes that contain all possible trajectories of the system. We show on some examples how HySon can be used to improve the quality of model-based design...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNenuFAR {{is both a}} giant {{extension}} of the LOFAR and a large standalone instrument in the low-frequency range (10 - 85 MHz). It was designed in Nançay with national and international collaboration. Antenna radiators were modeled on the LWA antenna design whereas preamplifiers were designed in France. Antennas will be distributed in 96 mini-arrays of 19 dual-polarized elements, densely covering a disk of 400 m in diameter. A few mini-arrays are expected to lie at distances of 2 - 3 km. A silent <b>control-command</b> <b>system</b> was designed, and the computer dialog with LOFAR defined. Receivers will include the LOFAR backend, a local beamformer and a local correlator. NenuFAR is in construction in Nançay and it was recently granted by the SKA office the official label of SKA pathfinder. Its exploitation will expand the scope of LOFAR scientific studies as well as permit new studies, preparing for SKA science. The NenuFAR concept has many points in common with GURT (the Giant Ukrainian Radio Telescope), with which it shares some technical studies, an its exploitation will benefit from a coordination with UTR- 2. We describe the instrument, technical developments and science case...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Safety {{is seen as}} a must, for railway {{transport}} market. However it is not so obvious what does safety exactly mean as it means different things for different experts. Showing safety ensured by control command systems as a component of the railway operational safety and pointing associated challenges especially those arising from subdivision of the national railway system into different entities. Methodology. To achieve this purpose control command and signalling systems keeping safe distances between trains, preventing setting conflicting train routs, locking of the mobile elements of the switches, protecting the level crossings, enabling safe incorporation of additional trains were analyzed. Findings. Article analyses how control command system influence operational safety taking into account safety of the <b>control-command</b> <b>system</b> itself, interfaces on one side between signalling systems and control command system {{and on the other side}} between control command system and vehicle control systems, transmission, maintenance, and operation in degraded modes of running. Originality. New and high-effective scope of tests which are necessary for putting new control command installation into service both track-side and on-board are proposed. Practical value. Control command implementations will significantly improve operational safety, however it is possible only when recommendations defined in this article are taken into account. This means that all the components including interfaces have to meet acceptable hazard rate 10 E- 9 and have to be properly design, constructed, assembled and maintained, all taking into account whole chain of functions performed and supervised by different railway entities...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a safe design method for <b>control-command</b> embedded <b>systems.</b> It investigates {{the problem of}} building <b>control-command</b> <b>systems</b> out of Commercial off the shelf (COTS) components. The design method proposed uses in synergy the formal verification (FV) and the Discrete Controller Synthesis (DCS) techniques. COTS are formally specified using temporal logic and/or executable observers. New functions are built by assembling COTS together. As the COTS assembly operation is seldom error-free, behavioral incompatibilities may persist between COTS. For these reasons, COTS assemblies need to be formally verified and if errors are found, an automatic correction is attempted using DCS. The control-command code generated by DCS needs hardware specific post-processing: a structural decomposition, followed by a controllability assessment, followed by a dedicated formal verification step, ensuring that no spurious behavior is added by DCS. The resulting system is ready for hardware (e. g. FPGA) implementation...|$|R

30|$|On {{international}} trains, onboard {{equipment for}} the various national control command systems must be installed. This {{is becoming more and}} more expensive due to the increasing sophistication and expense of equipment. A train crossing several European countries must switch to the <b>control-command</b> <b>systems</b> in the country it crosses. So, in order to remove these obstacles through the European rail network, the European Commission encouraged the development of a signalling and management system common to all member states: the ERTMS system (European Rail Traffic Management System). This will, therefore, reduce the validation and certification costs of ERTMS component implementation in different member states. The objective of this research work is to facilitate the interoperability through the mutual recognition of the ERTMS components between the member states by proposing test scenarios enabling cover checking.|$|R
40|$|Modern <b>control-command</b> <b>systems</b> {{often include}} {{controllers}} that perform nonlinear computations {{to control a}} physical system, which can typically be described by an hybrid automaton containing highdimensional systems of nonlinear differential equations. To prove safety of such systems, one must compute all the reachable sets from a given initial position, which might be uncertain (its value is not precisely known). On linear hybrid systems, efficient and precise techniques exist, but they fail to handle nonlinear flows or jump conditions. In this article, we present a new tool name HySon which computes the flowpipes of both linear and nonlinear hybrid systems using guaranteed generalization of classical efficient numerical simulation methods, including with variable integration step-size. In particular, we present an algorithm for detecting discrete events based on guaranteed interpolation polynomials {{that turns out to}} be both precise and efficient.

40|$|Synchronous {{reactive}} languages allow a {{high level}} deterministic description of reactive <b>systems</b> such as <b>control-command</b> <b>systems.</b> Their well defined mathematical semantics {{makes it possible to}} check formal properties on the control of a system. In previous work, we developed an object-oriented execution model for synchronous reactive modules. This model is implemented as a set of tools and a C++ class library, and allows us to use object-oriented methodologies and tools for the design of complex applications with both transformational and reactive parts. Among these design tools, the Ptolemy system stands as an object-oriented framework that supports various execution models, or "domains". We are currently working on a translator from the output format of the Lustre and Esterel compilers to the Ptolemy language. Since no existing domain matches the reactive synchronous execution model, we also plan to develop a SEC (Synchronous Execution and Communication) domain. Such a domain will provi [...] ...|$|R

In this article, we look at methods and tools for fast delivery of applications {{in the context of}} factory automation; more specifically in the field of industrial robotics and for numerical controller of machine-tools. We introduce a scheduling language together with a general framework in which both kinds of applications can be expressed. Its purpose it to generate a real-time controller tuned for the application described.

50|$|The {{need for}} a system like ETCS stems from more and longer running trains {{resulting}} from economic integration of the European Union (EU) and the liberalisation of national railway markets. At {{the beginning of the}} 1990s were some national high speed train projects supported by EU without interoperability of trains. This catalysed the Directive 1996/48 about the interoperability of high-speed trains, followed by Directive 2001/16 extending the concept of interoperability to the conventional rail system. ETCS specifications have become part of, or are referred to, the Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSI) for (railway) <b>control-command</b> <b>systems.</b> So it is a piece of European legislation managed by the European Union Agency for Railways (ERA). It is a legal requirement that all new, upgraded or renewed tracks and rolling stock in the European railway system should adopt ETCS, possibly keeping legacy systems for backward compatibility. Many networks outside the EU have also adopted ETCS, generally for high-speed rail projects.|$|R

The future Laser Megajoule facility requires <b>control-command</b> <b>systems</b> that will operate in a harsh radiative environment. Commercial off-the-shelf optical fiber data links are envisaged as a radiation tolerant solution for this application. In this paper, we present our preliminary study of their vulnerability. For this, we firstly have used an original method consisting of ultraviolet (5 eV) exposures of the fibers to identify the different germanosilicate optical fibers containing phosphorus, which leads them unacceptable for both steady state -rays and successive pulsed X-ray irradiations. We have demonstrated the validity of the -UV comparison by spectroscopic measurements. After this first selection, we have tested under pulsed X-rays (dose rate > 10 MGy/s dose 0 5 < kGy) the resistance of the P-free optical fibers at 1310 nm for the shortest times after an ionization pulse (10 - 9 to 10 - 1 s). Based on these results, we discuss the validity of the optical fiber data links for the control-command applications in LMJ facility...|$|R

However the CMOS device {{has a large}} flicker noise and deviation of threshold voltage, CMOS Operational-amplifier (Opamp) hardly amplifies a weak neural signal.

For oil-spill responders, we propose a captive Unmanned Aerial System, UAS acting like a periscope over a ship or supply vessel. The system is composed of an umbilical deployed from ship deck, and there are few studies that have examined elasticity within cable dynamic during take-off or landing (TOL) and normal flight phases. Therefore, the safest approach for the <b>control-commands</b> of the <b>system</b> is through umbilical dynamic modelling. We give a time-dependant finite-element formulation, using improved elastic non-linear cable elements. Two kinds of boundary condition, natural or essential, are discussed for roll-in or roll-out of the umbilical. A numerical convergence and a validation with an exact solution are provided, using two examples for the flight parameters. Finally, sensitivity of the model potentially extends its capacity for the system equilibrium prediction, under wind primary influence. Comment: 12 page...|$|R
40|$|Level {{crossing}} (LC) {{safety is}} a crucial issue for railway operators and infrastructure managers. Accidents at LCs give rise to serious material and human damage, while seriously impacting the reputation of railway safety. In particular, some typical scenarios are behind {{the main part of}} train-car collisions which occur at LCs. On the other hand, ERTMS (European Rail Traffic Management System) is the standard railway <b>control-command</b> and signaling <b>system</b> being currently implemented throughout Europe and elsewhere. The aim is to ensure railway interoperability while enhancing safety and competitiveness of railway transportation. ERTMS specifications only provide a rough description when dealing with level crossing control. The present study elaborates on a functional control architecture for automatic LCs in the context of ERTMS operation Levels 2 and 3. Indeed, these operation levels ensure a continuous knowledge of train location thanks to the GSM-R (Global System for Mobile communications - Railways) link between the trains and the Radio Block Center (RBC). Hence, the established LC control scheme aims to ensure an optimal LC command based on the information regarding the train location and, thereby, prevent some potential risky scenarios and improve the global safety at LCs. To achieve this, a generic methodology is employed. Firstly, a formal behavioral model is developed using the Time Petri Net (TPN) notation. Then, the problem is formalized {{on the basis of the}} established TPN, in such a way as to carry out a sound and trustworthy analysis. The various steps of the developed approach are detailed and illustrated in the course of the paper. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that seeks to elaborate a control strategy of automatic LC in the ERTMS operation context...|$|R
40|$|ERTMS is the {{standard}} railway <b>control-command</b> and signaling <b>system</b> which aims to ensure railway interoperability throughout Europe while enhancing safety and competitiveness. ERTMS is composed of two main subsystems which include GSM-R, a radio system for enabling communication between the train and the traffic management center and ETCS, an automatic train protection system (ATP) to replace the existing national ATP systems. The ERTMS specifications are defined by means of standard documents which set out the requirements ensuring interoperability. These documents evolve regularly to give rise to successive versions. The ERTMS/ETCS standard defines different levels and operation modes according to various trackside and onboard setups and some operational conditions. Given the complexity and the high criticality of railway operation, verification and validation (V&V) are crucial tasks in railway application development. In this paper, after setting the background and the motivations, a mechanizable formalization of a subset of ERTMS/ETCS specifications relative to ETCS modes and transitions is developed. The present work aims to offer a readily available model for formal V&V. Using formal techniques to check SRS is highly recommended to tackle {{the complexity of the}} defined requirements and prevent specification errors. Model-checking technique, which is targeted here, offers exhaustive analysis of the system behavior based on its model and is highly automated, since it is supported by software tools. Based on the last available version of SRS specifications, a progressive process is undertaken to get a formal model which makes explicit the various modes characterized by their respective active functions, as well as the numerous combinations of conditions for switching between modes. The various steps guiding the translation of the SRS literal specifications into a formal model are explained. As will be shown through different examples, the obtained model is a convenient basis to check safety, interoperability and liveness properties...|$|R
