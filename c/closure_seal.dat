40|$|Both the American National Standard for Radioactive Materials [...] Leakage Tests on Packages for Shipment (ANSI N 14. 5) and the ISO 12807 : 1996 Safe Transport of Radioactive Materials [...] Leakage Testing on Packages provide {{guidance}} for leakage rate testing {{to show that}} a particular packaging complies with regulatory requirements; both also {{provide guidance}} for determining appropriate acceptance criteria. Recent radioactive packaging designs have incorporated three-O-ring closure seals, the middle O-ring being the containment seal. These designs have the potential for false positive results in leakage rate tests. The volume between the containment O-ring and the inner O-ring is used for the helium gas required for the leakage rate tests, in order to reduce both the amount of helium used and the time required to conduct the tests. A leak detector samples the evacuated volume between the outer O-ring and the containment O-ring. False positive results can have two causes: a large leakage in the containment seal or leakage in the inner seal. This paper describes the problem, together with possible solutions and areas that should be addressed in a Safety Analysis Report for Packaging (SARP) before a particular packaging design can be certified for transport. Ultimately, the SARP should provide justification that the requirements for leakage rate testing procedures, including the length of time needed to conduct the tests, will ensure that the containment <b>closure</b> <b>seal</b> is properly tested...|$|E
40|$|The MCO is {{designed}} to facilitate the removal, processing and storage of the spent nuclear fuel currently stored in the East and West K-Basins. The MCO is a stainless steel canister approximately 24 inches in diameter and 166 inches long with cover cap installed. The shell and the collar which is welded to the shell are fabricated from 304 / 304 L dual certified stainless steel for the shell and F 304 /F 304 L dual certified for the collar. The shell has a nominal thickness of 1 / 2 inch. The top closure consists of a shield plug with four processing ports and a locking ring with jacking bolts to pre-load a metal seal under the shield plug. The fuel is placed in one of four types of baskets, excluding the SPR fuel baskets, in the fuel retention basin. Each basket is then loaded into the MCO which is inside the transfer cask. Once all of the baskets are loaded into the MCO, the shield plug with a process tube is placed into the open end of the MCO. This shield plug provides shielding for workers when the transfer cask, containing the MCO, is lifted from the pool. After being removed from the pool, the locking ring is installed and the jacking bolts are tightened to pre-load the metal main <b>closure</b> <b>seal.</b> The cask is then sealed and the MCO taken to the Cold Vacuum Drying (CVD) facility for bulk water removal and vacuum drying through the process ports. Covers for the process ports may be installed or removed as needed per operating procedures. The MCO is then transferred to the Canister Storage Building (CSB), in the closed transfer cask. At the CSB, the MCO is then removed from the cask and becomes one of two MCOs stacked in a storage tube. MCOs will have a cover cap welded over the shield plug providing a complete welded closure. A number of MCOs may be stored with just the mechanical seal to allow monitoring of the MCO pressure, temperature, and gas composition...|$|E

40|$|Packaging protects food {{products}} from environmental influences, assuring quality and safety throughout shelf life if properly performed. Packaging quality {{depends on the}} quality of the packaging material and of the <b>closure</b> or <b>seal.</b> A common problem possibly jeopardizing seal quality is the presence of seal contamination, which can cause a decreased seal strength, an increased packaging failure risk and leak formation. Therefore, early detection and removal of seal contaminated packages from the production chain is crucial. In this work, a pulsed-type active thermography method using the heated seal bars as an excitation source was studied for detecting seal contamination. Thermal image sequences of contaminated seals were recorded shortly after sealing. The detection performances of six thermal image processing methods, based on a single frame, a fit of the cooling profiles, thermal signal reconstruction, pulsed phase thermography, principal component thermography and a matched filter, were compared. High resolution digital images served as a reference to quantify seal contamination, and processed thermal images were mapped to these references. The lowest detection limit (equivalent diameter 0. 60 mm) was obtained for the method based on a fit of the cooling profiles. Moreover, the detection performance of this method did not depend strongly on the time after sealing at which recording of the thermal images was started, making it a robust and generally applicable method. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Aero-engine {{gas turbine}} {{performance}} and efficiency {{can be improved}} {{through the application of}} compliant shaft seal types to certain sealing locations within the secondary air system. Leaf seals offer better performance than traditional labyrinth seals, giving lower leakage flows at design duties. However, for aero-engine applications, seal designs must be able to cope with relatively large off-design <b>seal</b> <b>closures</b> and closure uncertainties. The two-way coupling between temperatures of seal components and <b>seal</b> <b>closures,</b> through the frictional heat generated at the leaf–rotor interface when in contact, represents an important challenge for leaf seal analysis and design. This coupling can lead to leaf wear and loss, rotor overheating, and possibly to unstable sealing system behavior (thermal runaway). In this paper, we use computational fluid dynamics (CFD), finite element (FE) thermal analysis, and experimental data to characterize the thermal behavior of leaf seals. This sets the basis for a study of the coupled thermomechanical behavior. CFD is used to understand the fluid-mechanics of a leaf pack. The leaf seal tested at the Oxford Osney Laboratory is used for the study. Simulations for four seal axial Reynolds number are conducted; for each value of the Reynolds number, leaf tip-rotor contact, and clearance are considered. Distribution of mass flow within the leaf pack, distribution of heat transfer coefficient (HTC) at the leaf surface, and swirl velocity pick-up across the pack predicted using CFD are discussed. The experimental data obtained from the Oxford rig is used to develop a set of thermal boundary conditions for the leaf pack. An FE thermal model of the rig is devised, informed by the aforementioned CFD study. Four experiments are simulated; thermal boundary conditions are calibrated to match the predicted metal temperatures to those measured on the rig. A sensitivity analysis of the rotor temperature predictions to the heat transfer assumptions is carried out. The calibrated set of thermal boundary conditions is shown to accurately predict the measured rotor temperatures. </p...|$|R

Between 3 and 10 min post lesion, a band of actin arose around the gap, which colocalized with a ring of ZO- 1 and occludin. Hence, tight junction proteins bound to the actin band facing the gap, and competent tight junctions assembled in the adjoining cell membranes. <b>Closure</b> and <b>sealing</b> were inhibited when actin polymerization was blocked by cytochalasin D, delayed following decrease of myosin-ATPase activity by butanedione monoxime, and blocked after myosin light chain kinase inhibition by ML- 7.
