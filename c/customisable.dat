5|$|The game also {{features}} sixteen licensed music tracks {{in addition to}} <b>customisable</b> soundtracks from techno artists, including Kraftwerk, DJ Fresh, and Skream.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy IX {{deviates}} {{from the}} style of <b>customisable</b> characters featured {{in the last two}} titles by reviving the character class concept, which designates a character to a certain role in battle. For example, Vivi is designated as a black mage and is the only character who can use black magic, and Steiner is a knight and is the only character who can use sword skills.|$|E
5|$|Swords and Sorcery is {{a fantasy}} role playing video game {{developed}} {{and published by}} Personal Software Services. It was released exclusively in the United Kingdom for the ZX Spectrum in 1985 and the Amstrad CPC in 1986. The game contains elements of dungeon crawling and revolves around a <b>customisable</b> player-character navigating through catacombs {{in order to secure}} a large wealth of treasure, whilst simultaneously collecting seven pieces of sacred armour.|$|E
5|$|Another feature {{introduced}} in Banjo-Tooie is the direct connections between its worlds. In Banjo-Kazooie the titular duo would be transported to each level via special doors in Gruntilda's lair, but in Banjo-Tooie the levels are physically connected at multiple points and are effectively {{extensions of the}} Isle o' Hags hub world. In addition, the train Chuffy {{can be used to}} migrate minor characters between worlds which contain stations. The game also includes a multiplayer mode where up to four players can play each of the game's single-player minigames in <b>customisable</b> competitions.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{original}} concept {{included an}} underground base that connected {{all of the}} levels, but this element was scrapped by publisher Psygnosis due to financial constraints. Several additional levels were also cut from the game due to time restrictions, including one inspired by Prince of Persia (1989). Following Walkers launch in February 1993, Dunlop began working on a port for the Mega Drive, which was cancelled shortly thereafter. Glancy was also recruited {{to work on a}} sequel, Walker 2, which would have overhauled the visual quality of the first game and include a <b>customisable</b> mech. Planned for release on the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, it was eventually cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, Perfect Dark {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} and commercial success, selling {{more than three}} million units worldwide. Critics widely praised its <b>customisable</b> multiplayer modes and replay value, but some criticised its low and inconsistent frame rate. The game received the BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Moving Images Award for 2000 and the Golden Satellite Award for Best Interactive Product in 2001. The game is frequently cited {{as one of the greatest}} video games of all time. A remaster, also titled Perfect Dark, with enhanced graphics and online multiplayer, was released for the Xbox 360 in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Grand Theft Auto: Vice City was {{released}} for Microsoft Windows on 12 May 2003, supporting higher screen resolutions and draw distance, and featuring more detailed textures. Releases were also planned on the Nintendo GameCube and Xbox, but the former was later cancelled. For its release on the Xbox in December 2003, Vice City was bundled with Grand Theft Auto III in a compilation titled Grand Theft Auto: Double Pack. The Xbox port features custom soundtrack support {{as well as}} improved audio, polygon models, and reflections over the previous ports. Double Pack was later bundled with San Andreas in a compilation titled , released in October 2005. The Trilogy was also released for OS X on 12 November 2010. For the game's tenth anniversary in December 2012, War Drum Studios ported Vice City to several iOS and Android devices. The port is almost identical to the Windows version of the game, but with enhanced visuals and a <b>customisable</b> layout. A PlayStation 3 version of Vice City {{was released}} on 30 January 2013 via the PlayStation Network. The original PlayStation 2 version of the game was released for the PlayStation 4 on 5 December 2015.|$|E
5|$|Both {{inside and}} outside battle, characters' {{relationships}} can be developed through interactions {{on and off the}} battlefield. As the strength of their relationships grow, certain abilities in battle are also strengthened. A feature introduced in Genealogy of the Holy War and used in later titles was an aspect of relationships. A man and woman who fall in love will have a child, and that child will inherit certain skills and stats from them. One of the recurring features in the series is permanent death, a function in which units defeated in battle are permanently removed {{from the rest of the}} game with very few exceptions (the main character, a character pivotal to the main story). Up until Fire Emblem: New Mystery of the Emblem: Heroes of Light and Shadow, there was no option to disable permanent death. In New Mystery of the Emblem, a new Casual Mode was added, in which characters that died were revived at the end of a battle. Fates also added Phoenix Mode, in which characters slain during one turn are revived on the player's next turn. Another inclusion from Fates includes 'My Castle', a <b>customisable</b> castle that serves as the player's base of operations throughout the game.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the campaign mode, Perfect Dark Zero features a multiplayer where a maximum of 32 players may compete in numerous types of deathmatch and objective-based games via split-screen, system link, or Xbox Live. The multiplayer offers two main modes with their own <b>customisable</b> options: DeathMatch and DarkOps. DeathMatch is a standard gametype where players spawn in rooms, collect weapons that {{are available on the}} map itself, and continue to the actual map. The overall objective of the game is determined by the scenario being played. Scenarios range from Killcount or Team Killcount, where the goal is to kill as many opposing players as possible, to objective-based games such as Capture the Flag and Territorial Gains. DarkOps, on the other hand, is a slower-paced and team-only gametype where weapons must be purchased from a player's stock of credits and credits are earned by killing enemies and completing objectives. Scenarios in this mode include Eradication, where the last team with any members left alive wins; Infection, where players score points by either infecting others or surviving infection; Sabotage, where the team that causes the most damage to the other team's property wins; and Onslaught, where one team must defend a base while the other has to attack it.|$|E
25|$|There were <b>customisable</b> kit toys of the House Robot Matilda, and {{competitors}} Hypno-Disc and Panic Attack. A Sergeant Bash pitstop kit was prototyped {{but never}} released.|$|E
25|$|Inspired by the books, the Imajica {{collectible}} {{card game}} {{was released by}} Harper Prism in August 1997. The game was designed by Sean Curren and Hans Rueffert as a two player <b>customisable</b> card game.|$|E
25|$|Plasma {{provides}} the main desktop user interface {{and is a}} rewrite of several core KDE applications, like the desktop drawing and most notably the widget engine. Plasma allows a more <b>customisable</b> desktop and more versatile widgets.|$|E
25|$|Gameplay tweaks {{introduced}} in MDK2: Armageddon include bigger switches, weaker and repositioned enemies, and wider ledges in platforming sections. Additionally, red arrows {{have been used}} to mark the important parts of the levels, and flashing circles point out where to shoot certain bosses. The game also features fully <b>customisable</b> controls, which take advantage of the pressure sensitive analog sticks of the DUALSHOCK 2.|$|E
25|$|Players are {{represented}} in the game with <b>customisable</b> avatars. RuneScape does not follow a linear storyline; rather, players set their own goals and objectives. Players can choose to fight non-player character (NPC) monsters, complete quests, or increase their experience in the available skills. Players {{interact with each other}} through trading, chatting, or by participating in mini-games and activities, some of which are competitive or combative in nature, while others require cooperative or collaborative play.|$|E
25|$|The game {{revolves}} around the player's control of a small character, known as a Sackboy or Sackgirl — or gender-neutral Sackperson — owing to their appearance, {{in a variety of}} platforming scenarios. Though the game features a set of pre-built levels for the player to explore, the game's <b>customisable</b> nature is equally important, from altering the player's character and personal space, to building entirely new objects and levels, and then sharing and playing them online with other players as part of the LittleBigPlanet community.|$|E
25|$|The game {{received}} a positive reaction from critics {{and has been}} praised for its presentation, including its graphics, physics, and audio, along with its gameplay and large array of <b>customisable</b> costumes and online features. Additional praise was given to its scope and future potential based on user-created content; minor criticism was reserved for specific elements of the gameplay mechanics and level creation facilities. LittleBigPlanet has won {{a considerable number of}} awards. A PSP version of the game was released in November 2009, featuring new levels and content. The game was offered by Sony as a free download as part of their 'Welcome Back' program, following the PlayStation Network outage of 2011.|$|E
500|$|Most reviewers criticised the port's {{touchscreen}} controls. Pocket Gamer's Mark Brown {{found them}} [...] "not ideal", but {{noted that this}} was also the case in the original game, while Digital Spy's Scott Nichols felt that the game [...] "only complicated [...] further". IGN's Davis was thankful for the addition of <b>customisable</b> controls, and wrote that they [...] "make the experience much more controllable", and Touch Arcade's Ford greatly appreciated the developer's efforts to [...] "make the situation bearable". Destructoid's Carter spoke favorably of the controls, despite noting awkward character movement, while The Telegraphs Hoggins found the controls [...] "far more accomplished" [...] than Grand Theft Auto IIIs mobile port.|$|E
500|$|The in-game {{features}} {{added in}} the port were well received. The addition of the Video Editor was met with positive reactions; GameSpot's Calvert called it [...] "a {{great way to get}} creative", while Kieron Gillen of Eurogamer criticised the unpredictability in its timing. Critics also praised the addition of the <b>customisable</b> radio station, which allows players to listen to their own choice of music; Tom Chick of 1UP.com named it the best feature of the port, and Steven Hopper of GameZone called it a [...] "great touch". The port's upgrade to 32 concurrent players in the online multiplayer mode, as opposed to the console version's 16 players, was also met with positive feedback; Eurogamer's Gillen said that the [...] "possibility for mayhem... increases", while Will Tuttle of GameSpy felt that the player increase [...] "changes the action significantly".|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was generally}} praised for the challenging artificial intelligence of enemies and varied level design. GameCritics credited the missions for their [...] "nice mix of timed, patterned, and random events that makes playing through them different and refreshing each time". The enemies were admired {{for their use}} of squad tactics, for waiting for the player to come back instead of obediently chasing after them, and for ducking around a corner for cover. GamePro also gave high marks to the game's Counter Operative mode for not letting the player playing as Joanna known which enemy the opposing player controls. The multiplayer and replay value were seen as the strongest features of the game. Reviewers noted that the flexibility of options, number of game modes, [...] "clever" [...] weapons, number of unlockable features, and <b>customisable</b> Simulants give the game [...] "endless replay value". GameCritics stated that [...] "Perfect Dark is easily the most advanced, elaborate, and entertaining multiplayer gaming experience on any home console." ...|$|E
500|$|GameSpot's Walton {{thought the}} {{graphics}} improvements made the open world [...] "even more spectacular", especially because of improved spatial anti-aliasing. Of the first-person view, {{he said that}} [...] "at ground level everything looks bigger and more imposing" [...] because of the improved graphics. IGN's Stapleton favoured the PlayStation 4 version's graphics over the Xbox One, but thought both consoles rendered the game well and maintained mostly consistent frame rates. He praised the increased frame rate and graphics options offered in the PC version. VideoGamer.com called the console version's frame rate so consistent it was [...] "scarcely believable", although GameSpot's Walton cited occasional frame rate dips. GameSpot's Peter Brown opined that the PC version let players [...] "witness {{the full extent of}} Rockstar's admirable handiwork", but noted that it [...] "retains evidence of its last-gen roots ... with simple geometry". VideoGamer.com praised the Rockstar Editor's accessibility on PC but criticised some of its limitations, such as camera angle restrictions. IGN's Stapleton appreciated the PC version's <b>customisable</b> controls, and GameSpot's Brown felt that constant switching between the mouse and keyboard and a gamepad was necessary for [...] "the best experience". PC Gamers Chris Thursten called the game [...] "the most beautiful, expansive and generous" [...] of the series.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{enjoyed the}} game's {{use of the}} PlayStation Vita's {{analogue}} control sticks. Jeuxvideo.com's Goyon praised the game's optimisation of the Vita's gyroscope and touchpad features and the extremely effective analogue stick. According to Parkin, the game's technical impediments made it a learning curve for the developers; he thought {{that they did not}} intend to reduce the manoeuvrability of the PlayStation Vita's analogue stick, in contrast to Wipeout HD. Digital Spy Mark Langshaw found the PlayStation Vita's analogue stick smooth and responsive, although he questioned its accessibility for players unfamiliar to the series. He enjoyed the game's use of the console's gyroscope and touchpad to manoeuvre and collect power-ups, respectively, but said that the touchpad did not have the same level of accuracy as its physical alternative. The gameplay in general was well regarded, including its replay value and balanced difficulty. Game Informer Dan Ryckert considered the game's replay value moderate; although its analogue stick did a [...] "good job" [...] of controlling the ships, it had a noticeable lack of traction. According to Hindman, the game would have benefited from a <b>customisable</b> control configuration and the three pre-made default setups were unsatisfactory. Willington cited Wipeout 2048 as the series' best handheld game and praising its tight controls and variety of content. Edges reviewer praised the multiplayer mode, saying that it [...] "adds weight and value to the package" [...] and gave a unique slant to the Vita’s online potential. [...] Shea and Bailey noted the game's reduced frame rate of 30 frames per second, a step down from the franchise's traditional 60 frames per second. Gerstmann thought that the frame rate occasionally affected gameplay and speed, but the game was mostly stable. Ian Dransfield of Play praised the game's replay value and multiplayer functions: [...] "It's the sort of game you’ll find yourself coming back to again". David Meikleham called Wipeout 2048 balanced difficulty consistently excellent, praising its long campaign as [...] "surprisingly hefty" [...] and not an [...] "on-the-go time-waster".|$|E
2500|$|The 770, {{like all}} Nokia Internet Tablets, runs Maemo, {{which is similar}} to many {{handheld}} operating systems, and provides a [...] "Home" [...] screen—the central point from which all applications and settings are accessed. The Home Screen is divided into areas for launching applications, a menu bar, and a large <b>customisable</b> area that can display information such as an RSS reader, Internet radio player, and Google search box for example. Maemo is a modified version of Debian.|$|E
2500|$|On 30 August 2012, Gerhard {{announced}} that an HTML5 version of RuneScape was in development {{that would allow}} the game to be played on [...] "your favourite tablets, platforms and even smart TVs." [...] A video released on 22 March 2013 stated that the new version would be called RuneScape 3 and would use WebGL, and would include a fully <b>customisable</b> user interface and improved audio. A closed beta of the HTML5 version went live on 17 April 2013, followed by a separate alpha version of the new interface on 24 April. RuneScape 3 was released on 22 July 2013.|$|E
2500|$|On 22 December 2010, Faber and Faber {{released}} a QI App. Amongst {{the features of}} the App are a library containing the complete contents of The Book of General Ignorance, The Book of Animal Ignorance and The QI Book of the Dead, arranged as 56 [...] "themed book" [...] on a <b>customisable</b> scrollable shelf. There is also a rolling selection of quotes from Advanced Banter. The App also allows users send interesting information to the QI elves in the form of [...] "postcards" [...] and can be rated on the [...] "Interestingometer". The top 10 most popular facts every week are listed on the QI website.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2000, {{after the}} game had been {{released}} for Dreamcast and PC, but prior to its PlayStation 2 release, IGN held an online discussion with the developers. Zeschuk said the PlayStation 2 version, titled MDK2: Armageddon would feature the same difficulty tweaks as found in the PC version, as well as slight redesigns within most of the levels, and some gameplay tweaks. He stated [...] "MDK2: Armageddon is an improved version of MDK2, with specific features for the PS2. It's not a completely new game. But it is an improved, customized game." [...] In November, IGN held a second online chat. Zeschuk stated Sony had recently looked at the game and been very impressed; [...] "They felt the gameplay improvements we've made, combined with the difficulty levels and slick controls really make MDK2: Armageddon for PS2 the definitive version of the game." [...] Gameplay tweaks introduced in MDK2: Armageddon include bigger switches, weaker and repositioned enemies, and wider ledges in platforming sections. Additionally, red arrows {{have been used to}} mark the important parts of the levels, and flashing circles point out where to shoot certain bosses. The game also features fully <b>customisable</b> controls, which take advantage of the pressure sensitive analog sticks of the DUALSHOCK 2.|$|E
