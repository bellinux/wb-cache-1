40|$|Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases are {{a family}} of enzymes that {{catalyze}} the conversion of NAD+ into ADP-ribose. Among them, Tankyrases {{have been found to}} bind to centrosome, mitotic spindle and microsome proteins, in the cytoplasm, and to telomeres in the nucleus, where they play a relevant role in telomere metabolism. However, their precise intracellular localization during interphase has not been so far fully elucidated. We investigated this aspect in situ by double immunofluorescence experiments using antibodies recognizing Tankyrases 1 - 2 or other proteins residing in specific organelles (Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum). We used HeLa cells as a model system in vitro, before and after treatment with either actinomycin D or etoposide, to also investigate the possible relocation of Tankyrases during apoptosis. We observed that Tankyrases are distributed both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm; in this latter compartment, they were found to <b>colocate</b> with the Golgi apparatus but never with the mitochondria; a pool of Tankyrases also <b>colocates</b> with the endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes. Interestingly, in cells with clear signs of apoptosis, Tankyrases were detectable in the cytoplasmic blebs: this suggests that they are not massively cleaved during apoptosis and persist in the largely heterogeneous apoptotic remnants which are known to contain components of cytoplasmic and nuclear origin...|$|R
2500|$|One {{of the two}} assault {{groups of}} the 81st {{regiment}} drove towards Pervomaiskaya Street, stretching out along the road for a mile. There was a temporary delay while the advanced detachment removed demolition charges at the River Neftyanka bridge along its route of advance. The first casualty was a T-72 tank attached to the reconnaissance platoon {{at the crossroads of}} the Mayakovskogo and Khmel'nitzkogo streets just before the Pervomaiskaya street, with the gunner and driver killed instantly from multiple RPG hits and internal ammunition detonation, while the commander survived. Small arms fire was also received, and one of the reconnaissance vehicles was disabled. Another was then attacked from the school building {{at the start of the}} Pervomaiskaya street, while a third reconnaissance vehicle had to be abandoned later due to extensive damage from heavy machine gun fire. As the reconnaissance platoon retreated into the column, there was some confusion because it was being followed up by a truck, and there was hesitation to fire on it as the Russian troops had orders only to return fire. However, it was evident that the truck was approaching the leading tank platoon at very high speed, and was engaged by the accompanying Tunguska, causing a huge detonation from which it was deduced that this was a suicide truck. Accompanying artillery fired into the area around the school building for about 45 minutes, and all incoming fire ceased. At 2pm the leading assault group reached the Mayakovskogo street objective as planned. However, while the first echelon was conducting artillery fire the 1st echelon vehicles (81st Gd MR Regt.) were stationary, and this caused the leading vehicles of the second echelon (2nd bn., 131st IMR Br.) to become intermingled with them due to lack of coordination. This lack of experience, including by the individual vehicle drivers, caused a considerable traffic jam at the Mayakovskogo and Khmelnitzkogo intersection for about 30 minutes. The intersection however represented the objective initially set for the first day of operation, and both battalion commanders commenced preparing their respective command for a defensive position in case of night attacks by Chechens. Suddenly an order from Pulikovsky was transmitted to resume the advance. Later Captain Arkhangelov, 81st Regiment's deputy for training <b>colocated</b> with the 1st Company, 1st Motor Rifle Battalion, reported call sign [...] "Mramor" [...] ordering a further advance due to the lack of significant opposition. It is thought that this call sign belonged to General Shevtzov, Chief of Staff of the Combined Group of Forces in the Chechen Republic.|$|E

In 1990, the initiative began funding drug treatment programs to provide HIV counseling, testing, and prevention services. HIV primary care was added the following year. Program implementation and development are described. An analysis is included of HIV counseling and testing data for the period 1990 – 2002 and quality of care data for five standardized quality measures with comparisons to data from other clinical settings. In the first 13  years of the initiative 168, 340 HIV-antibody tests were conducted including 52, 562 tests of injection drug users (IDUs) identifying 14, 612 HIV-infected persons; the seroprevalence was 8. 68 %. By the end of 2000, the HIV primary care caseload peaked at 3, 815 patients.

40|$|Quantitative trait loci (QTL) {{that control}} seed oil content and fatty acid {{composition}} were studied using a recombinant inbred population {{derived from a}} cross between the Arabidopsis ecotypes Landsberg erecta and Cape Verdi Islands. Multiple QTL model mapping identified two major and two minor QTL that account for 43 % {{of the variation in}} oil content in the population. The most significant QTL is at the bottom of chromosome 2 and accounts for 17 % of the genetic variation. Two other significant QTL, located on the upper and lower arms of chromosome 1, account for a further 19 % of the genetic variation. A QTL near to the top of chomosome 3 is epistatic to that on the upper arm of chromosome 1.
