5|$|<b>Coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>disease</b> is {{also known}} as ischemic heart disease, is caused by {{atherosclerosis}} – a build-up of plaque along the inner walls of the arteries which narrows them, reducing the blood flow to the heart. A stable plaque may cause chest pain (angina) or breathlessness during exercise or at rest, or no symptoms at all. A ruptured plaque can block a blood vessel and lead to ischaemia of the heart muscle, causing unstable angina or a heart attack. In the worst case this may cause cardiac arrest, a sudden and utter loss of output from the heart. Obesity, high blood pressure, uncontrolled diabetes, smoking and high cholesterol can all increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis and <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E

5|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}} (CVD) are {{the most}} common cause of death globally as of 2008, accounting for 30% of deaths. Of these more than three quarters are a result of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>disease</b> and stroke. Risk factors include: smoking, being overweight, little exercise, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and poorly controlled diabetes, among others. Cardiovascular diseases frequently do not have symptoms or may cause chest pain or shortness of breath. Diagnosis of heart disease is often done by the taking of a medical history, listening to the heart-sounds with a stethoscope, ECG, and ultrasound. Specialists who focus on diseases of the heart are called cardiologists, although many specialties of medicine may be involved in treatment.|$|E

Aims & Objectives: This study {{was done to}} compare the severity of hypercholesterolemia and risk of CVD in classical and probable cases of heterozygous {{familial hypercholesterolemia}} in tertiary care hospitals of Karachi. This was a case-series done from June 2008 to July 2010 at Dr Ziauddin Hospital and National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Karachi, Pakistan. Methods: Out of more than 240 patients with dyslipidemia or premature <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>diseases</b> 120 patients who had primary hypercholesterolemia and {{were found to have}} total cholesterol > 230 mg/dL and LDL-C > 160 mg/dL were included in the study.

Their blood samples were collected after twelve hours fasting. PCR was done for mutation specific primers for exons 3, 4, 9 and 14. Results: Out of these 120 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, classical cases with LDL-receptor gene mutation were 42 (35 %) and probable cases without LDL-receptor gene mutations were 78 (65 %). Eleven (27 %) of these classical cases had severe hypercholesterolemia having total cholesterol (> 290 mg/dL) and LDL-C (> 200 mg/dL) and were found to have xanthelasmas, xanthomas and arcus cornealis. Discussion/Conclusions: Amongst the HeFH patients from the tertiary care hospitals of Karachi, classical cases with tendon xanthomas and LDL receptor gene mutations had severe hypercholesterolemia with greater risk of CVD, they required more aggressive treatment.

5|$|Accelerated {{deposition}} of cholesterol {{in the walls}} of arteries leads to atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of cardiovascular disease. The most common problem in FH {{is the development of}} <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>disease</b> (atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries that supply the heart) at a much younger age than would be expected in the general population. This may lead to angina pectoris (chest pain or tightness on exertion) or heart attacks. Less commonly, arteries of the brain are affected; this may lead to transient ischemic attacks (brief episodes of weakness {{on one side of the}} body or inability to talk) or occasionally stroke. Peripheral artery occlusive disease (obstruction of the arteries of the legs) occurs mainly in people with FH who smoke; this can cause pain in the calf muscles during walking that resolves with rest (intermittent claudication) and problems due to a decreased blood supply to the feet (such as gangrene).|$|E
5|$|Heart {{failure is}} where the heart can't beat out enough blood {{to meet the needs}} of the body. It is {{generally}} a chronic condition, associated with age, that progresses gradually. Each side of the heart can fail independently of the other, resulting in heart failure of the right heart or the left heart. Left heart failure can also lead to right heart failure (cor pulmonale) by increasing strain on the right heart. If the heart is unable to pump sufficient blood, it may accumulate throughout the body, causing breathlessness in the lungs (pulmonary congestion; pulmonary edema), swelling (edema) of the feet or other gravity-dependent areas, decrease exercise tolerance, or cause other clinical signs such as an enlarged liver, cardiac murmurs, or a raised jugular venous pressure.

Material and methods: The study included 40 patients with three-vessels stable <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> <b>disease</b> referred to the surgical revascularization. Plasma levels of IgG class antibodies anti-Chlamydia pneumoniae, anti-Helicobacter pylori and anti-Mycoplasma pneumoniaewere determined with the tests based on the ELISA technique (Enzyme linked Immunosorbent Assay).

A cohort of 995 diabetic physicians and 9950 age- and sex-matched controls with diabetes were identified in 2000 and were followed to the end of 2008.
