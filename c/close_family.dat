5|$|Miller's {{older sister}} Keisha {{was killed in}} a car {{accident}} in 2005 at the age of 17, which inspired his jersey number change. Three additional <b>close</b> <b>family</b> members died in the three years prior to his 2011 ACL rehab. His mother is a nurse and he has 14 siblings. At Baylor, he served as Julius Randle's host for his visit.|$|E
5|$|Calment {{was born}} in Arles, Bouches-du-Rhone, Southern France on 21 February 1875. Her father, Nicolas Calment (28 January 1838 – 22 January 1931), was a shipbuilder, and her mother, Marguerite Gilles (20 February 1838 – 18 September 1924), was {{from a family of}} millers. She had an older brother, François (25 April 1865 – 1 December 1962). Some of her <b>close</b> <b>family</b> members also lived an above-average lifespan, {{although}} none lived anywhere near as long as Jeanne: her older brother François lived to the age of 97, her father to six days shy of 93, and her mother to 86.|$|E

5|$|During the German {{occupation}} of Greece {{almost all the}} Jews of Rhodes {{were sent to the}} Auschwitz concentration camp; as a result, most members of Etz Ahayem had <b>close</b> <b>family</b> members who were killed in the Holocaust. Before the occupation, however, members of the Kal Grande congregation in Rhodes had buried their Torah scrolls. After the war the scrolls were retrieved and sent to Israel, and a Dr. Nace Cohen was able to procure one of them for Etz Ahayem.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Songbird: Eva Cassidy: Her Story By Those Who Knew Her, {{a book on}} {{the life}} and work of Cassidy based on {{interviews}} with <b>close</b> <b>family</b> and associates, was released in the UK. The hardcover edition has since sold in excess of 100,000copies. A US edition published by Gotham Books was released in late 2003 and includes two additional chapters on her influences and success in the US. Her life story has also been adapted into a musical and also a Broadway piece for cancer benefit.|$|E
5|$|In Nikki Stafford's analysis, the {{reactions}} of Buffy, Dawn, Xander, Willow, Anya, and Tara represent stages of Elisabeth Kübler-Ross' five stages of grief in different parts. Joss Whedon stated on the DVD commentary how surprised {{he was at the}} response from viewers who wrote to say that the episode allowed them to accept the death of a <b>close</b> <b>family</b> member, even if they had not acknowledged it for months or years. Joyce's death was the first by natural causes in the series.|$|E

5|$|In Retford, MacMillan was {{introduced}} to ballet by a local dance teacher, Jean Thomas. He had already had lessons in Scottish dancing in Dunfermline and tap dancing in Great Yarmouth, and he took to ballet immediately. In 1942 his mother died, which caused him acute and lasting distress. His father was a distant figure, and the boy's only <b>close</b> <b>family</b> relationship was with an elder sister. His obituarist in The Times suggests that {{the feeling of being}} an outsider, displayed in many of MacMillan's ballets, had its roots in his childhood.|$|E
5|$|Kali is a winch {{operator}} at {{a village}} power plant. Although a reputed troublemaker, he occasionally does good deeds {{for the local}} community. Kali and his younger sister Vallito whom he is devotedwere orphaned during their childhood and have no <b>close</b> <b>family.</b> When a poor wanderer named Manga and her aged mother arrive in the village with no assets and no-one to assist them, Valli helps them set up their home in the village. Although Manga becomes fond of Kali, he is disgusted by her fondness for food.|$|E
5|$|On 12 November, in New York, Harrison, Starr and McCartney came {{together}} for the last time. Less than three weeks later, on 29 November 2001, Harrison died at a friend's home in Los Angeles, aged 58. He was cremated at Hollywood Forever Cemetery and his funeral {{was held at the}} Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine in Pacific Palisades, California. His ashes were then scattered in the Ganges and Yamuna rivers near Varanasi, India, by his <b>close</b> <b>family</b> in a private ceremony according to Hindu tradition. He left almost £100million in his will.|$|E

5|$|Stela 11 was {{originally}} an interior column from Temple 18, the funerary shrine of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat. When it was found, {{it was broken}} in two parts {{at the base of}} the temple. It portrays the king as the elderly Maya maize god and has imagery that seems to deliberately parallel the tomb lid of the Palenque king K'inich Janaab' Pakal, probably because of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat's <b>close</b> <b>family</b> ties to that city. The text of the column formed part of a longer text carved onto the interior walls of the temple and may describe the downfall of the Copán dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The Darwins had ten children: two died in infancy, and Annie's {{death at}} the age of ten had a devastating effect on her parents. Charles was a devoted father and uncommonly {{attentive}} to his children. Whenever they fell ill, he feared that they might have inherited weaknesses from inbreeding due to the <b>close</b> <b>family</b> ties he shared with his wife and cousin, Emma Wedgwood. He examined this topic in his writings, contrasting it with the advantages of crossing amongst many organisms. Despite his fears, most of the surviving children and many of their descendants went on to have distinguished careers (see Darwin-Wedgwood family).|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} January Rogers married Sarah Whetstone, {{daughter of}} Rear Admiral Sir William Whetstone, {{who was a}} neighbour and <b>close</b> <b>family</b> friend. Rogers became a freeman of Bristol because of his marriage into the prominent Whetstone family. In 1706, Captain Rogers died at sea, leaving his ships and business to his son Woodes. Between 1706 {{and the end of}} 1708, Woodes and Sarah Rogers had a son and two daughters.|$|E

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{introduce}} and consider a new hybrid shrinking projection algorithm for finding a common element of the set of solutions of a system of equilibrium problems, the set of solutions of a system of variational inequality problems, the set of solutions of a system of optimization problems, the common fixed point set of a uniformly <b>closed</b> <b>family</b> of countable quasi-Bregman strictly pseudocontractive mappings in reflexive Banach spaces. Strong convergence theorems have been proved under the appropriate conditions. The main innovative points in this paper are as follows: (1) the notion of uniformly <b>closed</b> <b>family</b> of countable quasi-Bregman strictly pseudocontractive mappings is presented and the useful conclusions are given; (2) the relative examples of the uniformly <b>closed</b> <b>family</b> of countable quasi-Bregman strictly pseudocontractive mappings are given in classical Banach spaces l^ 2 and L^ 2; (3) the hybrid shrinking projection method presented in this paper modified some mistakes in the recent result of Ugwunnadi et al.

5|$|The mission did {{fail and}} the {{internal}} settlement talks were resurrected, resulting in a deal on 4 March 1978. A transitional joint Council of Ministers was set up, with Van der Byl having to work with Dr Elliott Gabellah as his co-Minister of Foreign Affairs. The Patriotic Front took no notice of this accord and the guerrilla war continued; Lord Richard Cecil, a <b>close</b> <b>family</b> friend working as a photo-journalist, was killed by guerrillas on 20 April 1978 after Van der Byl had ensured he had full access to military areas denied to other reporters.|$|E
5|$|A {{person with}} Tourette's has about a 50% chance of passing the gene(s) {{to one of}} his or her children, but Tourette's is a {{condition}} of variable expression and incomplete penetrance. Thus, not everyone who inherits the genetic vulnerability will show symptoms; even <b>close</b> <b>family</b> members may show different severities of symptoms, or no symptoms at all. The gene(s) may express as Tourette's, as a milder tic disorder (provisional or chronic tics), or as obsessive–compulsive symptoms without tics. Only a minority of the children who inherit the gene(s) have symptoms severe enough to require medical attention. Gender appears to have a role in the expression of the genetic vulnerability: males are more likely than females to express tics.|$|E
5|$|Although Buffy and {{her friends}} deal with death every week, often in very gruesome and fantastic ways, in this episode they are bewildered by the natural death of Joyce Summers, the {{divorced}} mother of Buffy and her sister Dawn and occasionally a mother figure to their friends. They struggle to comprehend what the loss means {{to each of them}} and to the group. Buffy must begin to face her life and her duties as the Slayer without parental support and comfort. The episode was stripped of all music—a regular staple of the Buffy series—and disorienting effects were included to convey the sense of displacement and loss associated with the death of a <b>close</b> <b>family</b> member.|$|E

5|$|By William's death, after {{weathering}} {{a series}} of rebellions, most of the native Anglo-Saxon aristocracy {{had been replaced by}} Norman and other continental magnates. Not all of the Normans who accompanied William in the initial conquest acquired large amounts of land in England. Some appear to have been reluctant to take up lands in a kingdom that did not always appear pacified. Although some of the newly rich Normans in England came from William's <b>close</b> <b>family</b> or from the upper Norman nobility, others were from relatively humble backgrounds. William granted some lands to his continental followers from the holdings of one or more specific Englishmen; at other times, he granted a compact grouping of lands previously held by many different Englishmen to one Norman follower, often to allow for the consolidation of lands around a strategically placed castle.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{performances}} can {{be classified}} as either formal ones or informal. During formal performances adherents follow a traditional set of rules that would govern playing and it usually involved people from outside the home. Informal performances are quite the opposite. The strict rules that normally govern play are often ignored and the performers are usually between people well acquainted with one another, usually <b>close</b> <b>family</b> members. These performances usually were times when amateurs practiced on the instruments, young boys and girls gathered the instruments, substituting the kulintang with the saronay and inubab. Ensembles didn’t necessary have to have five instruments like formal performances: they could be composed of only four instruments (three gandingan gongs, a kulintang, an agung, and a dabakan), three instruments (a kulintang, a dabakan, and either an agung or three gandingan gongs) or simply just one instrument (kulintang solo).|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} the {{intensive}} bombing worried the authorities and 'Mass-Observation' was deployed to gauge attitudes and provide policy suggestions, as before the war they had investigated local attitudes to anti-Semitism. The organisation noted that <b>close</b> <b>family</b> and friendship links within the East End were providing the population with a surprising resilience under fire. Propaganda was issued, reinforcing {{the image of the}} 'brave chirpy Cockney'. On the Sunday after the Blitz began, Winston Churchill himself toured the bombed areas of Stepney and Poplar. Anti-aircraft installations were built in public parks, such as Victoria Park and the Mudchute on the Isle of Dogs, and along the line of the Thames, as this was used by the aircraft to guide them to their target.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The plane {{circular}} restricted three-body {{problem has}} infinitely many families of symmetric periodic solutions (SPS). Among natural families of SPS, {{there are some}} that close upon themselves when the parameter changes (the family c, for example). These families preserve this property for all admissible values of the mass parameter μ. There is, however, another type of <b>closed</b> <b>families</b> of SPS that exist only in some intervals of values of μ, and which appear as a result of self-bifurcations of some families of SPS. These type of <b>closed</b> <b>families</b> is poorly understood. In this paper we describe an initial part of an infinite cascade of self-bifurcations of the natural family i (4 bifurcations).
