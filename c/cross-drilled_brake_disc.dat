In the present paper, a simulation approach for evaluation of <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> designs with respect to thermomechanical performance is developed and applied. <b>Brake</b> <b>disc</b> performance is analysed using commercial finite element software by employing a constitutive model for grey cast iron implemented in a Fortran subroutine.

In order to develop proper heat ventilation a wide range of <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> have been designed. Different types of physical <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> geometries, as front- and back-vented <b>brake</b> <b>discs,</b> affect the heat ventilation directly. This is a vital factor of the brake’s capability. We recognized the importance of this circumstance and therefore attempted to create a test to investigate the temperature gradient of the <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> in order to evaluate the coefficients of heat convection. The coefficients were modified by the change of temperature distribution in both <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> under the forced heat convection in steady state conditions. However, the heat radiation value does not take into account that the heat convection is dominated by the physical geometry of the <b>brake</b> <b>disc.</b> To set up the experimental test for investigating the heat transfer by convection the JASO C 406 standard is adopted. The experimental results in terms of heat convection coefficients are used in the numerical simulation via the finite element method in order to study the temperature diffusion and heat ventilation of front and back-vented <b>brake</b> <b>discs.</b> Conse-quently, the experimental results reveal that the overall heat convection coefficients of the front-vented <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> are higher than these of the back-vented one. In other words the simulation yields that the front-vented <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> allows stronger heat ventilation than its compared object, leading to larger temperature differences between outboard and inboard rotors, resulting in more thermal stress.

Depending on the application, {{a wide variety of}} <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> have been developed, with a multitude of designs, geometries and materials. The <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> materials used for heavy-duty vehicles are still mostly based on traditional grey cast iron, due to its favourable performance and low cost. Gradual improvements of the thermal and mechanical properties of grey cast iron for production of <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> have been introduced over the years through fine-tuning of the alloying elements. Nevertheless, because of a material behaviour that comprises non-linear elasticity and non-symmetric yield stress in tension and compression, the mechanical properties of grey cast iron are not as well established as those of steel or aluminium alloys. The subject of the present work is {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms that control the life of cast iron <b>brake</b> <b>discs.</b> In the end, the aim is an enhanced vehicle performance and reduced maintenance costs of heavy-duty vehicles.

Second, full-scale brake dynamometer experiments have been carried out and analysed, with <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> made from eight different grey cast iron alloys, at controlled torque, speed and cooling conditions.

Detailed analyses were performed on temperature data to clarify characteristics of the tested <b>brake</b> <b>discs.</b> The main phenomena influencing the life of <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> were identified, and the spatial fixation of bands and/or hot spots was found to have a major impact on disc life. Third, a constitutive model useful for grey cast iron was implemented for use with a commercial finite element software. The model was calibrated for temperatures relevant for braking applications using dedicated isothermal tests and, finally, validated against monotonic tensile tests, isothermal fatigue tests and thermomechanical fatigue tests.
