5|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of milled coinage, hammered coinage, which resulted in a relatively <b>crude</b> <b>product</b> of irregular shape and size, predominated in European mints. In , an Augsburg goldsmith named Max Schwab created a new technique for striking coins, which included the use of rolling mills, presses to cut the coinage blanks and the coinage press. After learning about the invention via the French ambassador, King Henry II dispatched the Comptroller of Finance Guillaume de Marillac and François Guilhem, Master of the Mint in Lyon, to observe the machinery. Schwab's press was turned with a weighted wooden handle, which exerted even pressure across the coinage blank, creating a sharper and more precise strike than hammering. De Marillac requested that Anne de Montmorency send him an engineer capable of creating a similar machine; he sent the engineer Aubin Olivier. Olivier viewed the machine, and introduced his own version to France, to which he later added a segmented collar. This allowed for the expanding metal to fill the collar, creating reeding, designs or edge lettering {{at the same time as}} the obverse and reverse images were struck onto the coin. The segments of the collar were then removed, and the coin ejected. Such lettering was used to aid in detecting coins which were debased by clipping metal from their edges, a problem frequently encountered in hammered coinage. Olivier's method of striking coins was considered costly relative to the previously utilised method, as the upper coinage die often came into contact with the collar on its downward descent, causing expensive damage. Milled coinage was thus abandoned in 1585 in favour of hammering.|$|E
500|$|... (1) Most often, 5'-DMT {{group is}} removed {{at the end}} of the {{oligonucleotide}} chain assembly. The oligonucleotides are then released from the solid phase and deprotected (base and phosphate) by treatment with aqueous ammonium hydroxide, aqueous methylamine, their mixtures, gaseous ammonia or methylamine or, less commonly, solutions of other primary amines or alkalies at ambient or elevated temperature. This removes all remaining protection groups from 2'-deoxyoligonucleotides, resulting in a reaction mixture containing the desired product. If the oligonucleotide contains any 2'-O-protected ribonucleotide residues, the deprotection protocol includes the second step where the 2'-O-protecting silyl groups are removed by treatment with fluoride ion by various methods. The fully deprotected product is used as is, or the desired oligonucleotide can be purified by a number of methods. Most commonly, the <b>crude</b> <b>product</b> is desalted using ethanol precipitation, size exclusion chromatography, or reverse-phase HPLC. To eliminate unwanted truncation products, the oligonucleotides can be purified via polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or anion-exchange HPLC followed by desalting.|$|E

40|$|A {{program has}} been {{initiated}} towards the chemical profiling of chemical warfare agents, {{in order to support}} forensic investigations towards synthesis routes, production sites and suspect chemical suppliers. Within the first stage of the project various chemical warfare agents (VX, sulfur mustard, sarin) have been prepared according to well-known or more obscure quick-and-dirty synthesis protocols. After minimal work-up, the <b>crude</b> <b>products</b> were analyzed with GC-MS, affording highly useful mass spectral data sets of byproducts. The intact agents were present at moderate to high levels in most <b>crude</b> <b>products.</b> In several cases it was possible to correlate the applied synthesis route to the formation of unique byproducts, or to a characteristic ratio of byproducts. It was also assessed that {{for the majority of the}} <b>crude</b> <b>products</b> the chemical profile remained more or less intact upon prolonged storage. This was remarkable because it was expected that the <b>crude</b> <b>products</b> would decompose rather quickly because of the presence of traces of acid. In the current presentation, the focus will lie on the results obtained for VX. Inter alia, the stability of the chemical profile was assessed for the crude VX batches in/on several matrices (soil, water, wood, textile and rubber). Dependent on the matrix, VX could be detected up to several weeks after liquid extraction or thermodesorption followed by GC-MS analysis, while for some of the <b>crude</b> <b>products</b> the characteristic byproducts could still be detected...|$|R

Sonication was expected to improve both the dispersion of the substrate in the solvent and the diffusion of the silane throughout the mesoporous substrate.
