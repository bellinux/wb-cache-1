This is <b>conformant</b> with the Liskov substitution principle, which states that all operations performed on an instance of a given type can also be performed on an instance of a subtype.

25|$|Despite {{its name}} FAT32 uses only 28 {{bits of the}} 32 {{possible}} bits. The upper 4 bits are usually zero, but are reserved and should be left untouched. A standard <b>conformant</b> FAT32 file system driver or maintenance tool must not rely on the upper 4 bits to be zero and it must strip them off before evaluating the cluster number in order to cope with possible future expansions where these bits {{may be used for}} other purposes. They must not be cleared by the file system driver when allocating new clusters, but should be cleared during a reformat.|$|E
25|$|XHTML was {{developed}} to make HTML more extensible and increase interoperability with other data formats. In addition, browsers were forgiving of errors in HTML, and most websites were displayed despite technical errors in the markup; XHTML introduced stricter error handling. HTML 4 was ostensibly an application of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML); however the specification for SGML was complex, and neither web browsers nor the HTML 4 Recommendation were fully <b>conformant</b> to it. The XML standard, approved in 1998, provided a simpler data format closer in simplicity to HTML 4. By shifting to an XML format, it was hoped HTML would become compatible with common XML tools; to work…}} servers and proxies {{would be able to}} transform content, as necessary, for constrained devices such as mobile phones.|$|E

Yokoi retained RTI's choice of red LED {{because it was the}} cheapest, and because unlike a totally backlit LCD, its [...] perfect blackness could achieve a more immersive sense of infinite depth. RTI and Nintendo said a color LCD system would have been prohibitively expensive, retailing for more than [...] A color LCD system was also said to have caused [...] "jumpy images in tests". With ongoing concerns about motion sickness, the risk of developing lazy eye conditions in young children, and Japan's new Product Liability Act of 1995, Nintendo eliminated the head tracking functionality and converted its headmounted goggle design into a stationary, heavy, precision steel-shielded, tabletop form factor <b>conformant</b> to the recommendation of the Schepens Eye Research Institute.|$|E
2500|$|In day-to-day {{business}} it happens that containers do appear {{which do not}} follow the ISO 6346 identification at all; however, they are fully CSC safety approved containers. Usually these are [...] "shippers owned" [...] containers, {{which means that they}} are not owned by the carrier but supplied by the cargo owners (shippers). They may have no registered owner code and no category identifier and have no check digit. It is advisable to follow ISO 6346 as the absence of a compliant identification code causes problems for both carriers and container terminals to correctly identify the equipment and properly deliver the cargo, because computer systems require ISO 6346 <b>conformant</b> naming and as such missing prefixes are invented. For example, YYYY at the carrier and XXXX at the terminal causes the equipment to mismatch. Moreover, since ISO 6346 identification has become a requirement in international Customs conventions (Customs Conventions on Containers and Istanbul Convention), many Customs Administrations have begun validating that containers are marked as per the standard.|$|E
6000|$|Having {{shown that}} M. Comte's alleged law of {{progression}} {{does not hold}} among the several parts of the same science, let us see how it agrees with the facts when applied to separate sciences. [...] "Astronomy," [...] says M. Comte, {{at the opening of}} Book III., [...] "was a positive science, in its geometrical aspect, from the earliest days of the school of Alexandria; but Physics, which we are now to consider, had no positive character at all till Galileo made his great discoveries on the fall of heavy bodies." [...] On this, our comment is simply that it is a misrepresentation based upon an arbitrary misuse of words--a mere verbal artifice. By choosing to exclude from terrestrial physics those laws of magnitude, motion, and position, which he includes in celestial physics, M. Comte makes it appear that the one owes nothing to the other. Not only is this altogether unwarrantable, but it is radically inconsistent with his own scheme of divisions. At the outset he says--and as the point is important we quote from the original--"Pour la physique inorganique nous voyons d'abord, en nous <b>conformant</b> toujours a l'ordre de généralité et de dépendance des phénomènes, qu'elle doit être partagée en deux sections distinctes, suivant qu'elle considère les phénomènes généraux de l'univers, ou, en particulier, ceux que présentent les corps terrestres. D'où la physique céleste, ou l'astronomie, soit géométrique, soit mechanique; et la physique terrestre." ...|$|E

In preaching, Mr. Grant endeavored to steer a middle course between the mystical doctrines of those sublimated creeds which daily involve their professors in the most absurd contradictions, and those fluent roles of moral government which would reduce the Saviour to a level with the teacher of a school of ethics. Doctrine it was necessary to preach, for nothing less would have satisfied the disputatious people who were his listeners, and who would have interpreted silence on his part into a tacit acknowledgment of the superficial nature of his creed. We have already said that, among the endless variety of religious instructors, the settlers were accustomed to hear every denomination urge its own distinctive precepts, and to have found one indifferent to this Interesting subject would have been destructive to his influence. But Mr. Grant so happily blended the universally received opinions of the Christian faith with the dogmas of his own church that, although none were entirely exempt from the influence of his reasons, very few took any alarm at the innovation.|$|E
