5|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that the <b>Chelicerata</b> contain the classes Arachnida (spiders, scorpions, mites, etc.), Xiphosura (horseshoe crabs) and Eurypterida (sea scorpions, extinct). The extinct Chasmataspida may be a sub-group within Eurypterida. The Pycnogonida (sea spiders) were traditionally classified as chelicerates, but some features suggest they may be representatives of the earliest arthropods from which the well-known groups such as chelicerates evolved.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Chelicerata</b> are {{arthropods}} as they have: segmented {{bodies with}} jointed limbs, all {{covered in a}} cuticle made of chitin and proteins; heads that are composed of several segments that fuse during {{the development of the}} embryo; a much reduced coelom; a hemocoel through which the blood circulates, driven by a tube-like heart. Chelicerates' bodies consist of two tagmata, sets of segments that serve similar functions: the foremost one, called the prosoma or cephalothorax, and the rear tagma is called the opisthosoma or abdomen. However, in the Acari (mites and ticks) there is no visible division between these sections.|$|E
25|$|The genus Eurypterus {{belongs to}} the family Eurypteridae. They are {{classified}} under the superfamily Eurypteroidea, suborder Eurypterina, order Eurypterida, and the subphylum <b>Chelicerata.</b> Until recently, eurypterids were thought {{to belong to the}} class Merostomata along with order Xiphosura. It is now believed that eurypterids are a sister group to Arachnida, closer to scorpions and spiders than to horseshoe crabs.|$|E
25|$|The {{project began}} with {{work on a}} few, mostly slim volumes in which a single senior {{specialist}} in a distinct field of invertebrate paleozoology would summarize one particular group. As a result, each publication became a comprehensive compilation of everything known at that time for each group. Examples of {{this stage of the}} project are Part G. Bryozoa, by Ray S. Bassler (the first volume, published in 1953), and Part P. Arthropoda Part 2, the <b>Chelicerata</b> by Alexander Petrunkevitch (1955/1956).|$|E
25|$|Discovering {{relationships}} within the arachnids has proven difficult , with successive studies producing different results. A study in 2014, {{based on the}} largest set of molecular data to date, concluded that there were systematic conflicts in the phylogenetic information, particularly affecting the orders Acariformes, Parasitiformes and Pseudoscorpiones, which have had much faster evolutionary rates. Analyses of the data using sets of genes with different evolutionary rates produced mutually incompatible phylogenetic trees. The authors favoured relationships shown by more slowly evolving genes, which demonstrated the monophyly of <b>Chelicerata,</b> Euchelicerata and Arachnida, {{as well as of}} some clades within the arachnids. The diagram below summarizes their conclusions, based largely on the 200 most slowly evolving genes; dashed lines represent uncertain placements.|$|E
25|$|Scorpions are {{opportunistic}} predators {{of small}} arthropods, although the larger kinds {{have been known}} to kill small lizards and mice. The large pincers are studded with highly sensitive tactile hair, and the moment an insect touches these, they use their chelae (pincers) to catch the prey. Depending on the toxicity of their venom and size of their claws, they will then either crush the prey or inject it with neurotoxic venom. This will kill or paralyze the prey so the scorpion can eat it. Scorpions have an unusual style of eating using chelicerae, small claw-like structures that protrude from the mouth that are unique to the <b>Chelicerata</b> among arthropods. The chelicerae, which are very sharp, are used to pull small amounts of food off the prey item for digestion into a pre-oral cavity below the chelicerae and carapace. Scorpions can ingest food only in a liquid form; they have external digestion. The digestive juices from the gut are egested onto the food and the digested food sucked in liquid form. Any solid indigestible matter (fur, exoskeleton, etc.) is trapped by setae in the pre-oral cavity, which is ejected by the scorpion.|$|E
500|$|The subphylum <b>Chelicerata</b> ( [...] or New Latin, from French chélicère, from Greek khēlē [...] "claw, chela" [...] and kéras [...] "horn") {{constitutes}} one of {{the major}} subdivisions of the phylum Arthropoda. It contains the horseshoe crabs, sea spiders, and arachnids (including scorpions and spiders).|$|E
500|$|The <b>chelicerata</b> {{originated}} as marine animals, {{possibly in}} the Cambrian period, {{but the first}} confirmed chelicerate fossils, eurypterids, date from [...] in the Late Ordovician period. The surviving marine species include the four species of xiphosurans (horseshoe crabs), and possibly the 1,300species of pycnogonids (sea spiders), if the latter are indeed chelicerates. On the other hand, there are over 77,000well-identified species of air-breathing chelicerates, {{and there may be}} about 500,000unidentified species.|$|E
500|$|However, the {{structure}} of [...] "family tree" [...] relationships within the <b>Chelicerata</b> has been controversial ever since the late 19th century. An attempt in 2002 to combine analysis of RNA features of modern chelicerates and anatomical features of modern and fossil ones produced credible results for many lower-level groups, but its results for the high-level relationships between major sub-groups of chelicerates were unstable, in other words minor changes in the inputs caused {{significant changes in the}} outputs of the computer program used (POY). An analysis in 2007 using only anatomical features produced the cladogram on the right, but also noted that many uncertainties remain.|$|E

2500|$|Arachnids are a class (Arachnida) of joint-legged {{invertebrate}} animals (arthropods), in the subphylum <b>Chelicerata.</b> All arachnids {{have eight}} legs, although the front pair of legs in some species has {{converted to a}} sensory function, while in other species, different appendages can grow large enough {{to take on the}} appearance of extra pairs of legs. The term is derived from the Greek word [...] (aráchnē), from the myth of the hubristic human weaver Arachne who was turned into a spider. Spiders are the largest order in the class, which also includes scorpions, ticks, mites, harvestmen, and solifuges.|$|E
5000|$|The {{phylogeny}} of {{the major}} extant arthropod groups has been an area of considerable interest and dispute. Recent studies strongly suggest that Crustacea, as traditionally defined, is paraphyletic, with Hexapoda having evolved from within it, so that Crustacea and Hexapoda form a clade, Pancrustacea. The position of Myriapoda, <b>Chelicerata</b> and Pancrustacea remains unclear [...] In some studies, Myriapoda is grouped with <b>Chelicerata</b> (forming Myriochelata); in other studies, Myriapoda is grouped with Pancrustacea (forming Mandibulata), or Myriapoda may be sister to <b>Chelicerata</b> plus Pancrustacea.|$|E

50|$|The {{placement}} of the extinct trilobites is also a frequent subject of dispute.
