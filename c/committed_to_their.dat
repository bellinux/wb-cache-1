5|$|Hemming's {{introduction}} {{to his work}} (Prefatio) claims that it was produced to teach Wulfstan's successors: about the things which have been <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> care, and to show them which lands justly belong (or ought to belong) to the church, and which have been unjustly seized by evil men—first, during the Danish invasions; later, by unjust royal officials and tax collectors; and most recently, by the violence of Normans in our own time, who by force, guile and rapine have unjustly deprived this holy church of its lands, villages and possessions, until hardly anything is safe from their depredations.|$|E
5|$|The Athenians now {{ended their}} {{alliance}} with the Ionians, since the Persians had proved {{to be anything but}} the easy prey that Aristagoras had described. However, the Ionians remained <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> rebellion and the Persians did not seem to follow up their victory at Ephesus. Presumably these ad hoc forces were not equipped to lay siege to any of the cities. Despite the defeat at Ephesus, the revolt actually spread further. The Ionians sent men to the Hellespont and Propontis and captured Byzantium and the other nearby cities. They also persuaded the Carians to join the rebellion. Furthermore, seeing the spread of the rebellion, the kingdoms of Cyprus also revolted against Persian rule without any outside persuasion.|$|E
5|$|The Invisible Touch Tour was the band's largest {{world tour}} {{in its history}} which {{included}} 112 dates from September 1986 to July 1987. Genesis received some criticism in their decision to have Michelob beer as a sponsor. The tour concluded with four consecutive sold-out shows at Wembley Stadium in London. The shows were released in 1988 as The Invisible Touch Tour. When the tour ended, Genesis took a five-year break while each member <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> solo projects. They performed twice during this time; on 14 May 1988, they performed a 20-minute set at the Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary concert at Madison Square Garden.

5|$|After being {{withdrawn}} back to Australia in March 1944, {{the units}} of the 7th Division received six weeks' leave before reforming on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland. Following this the 2/14th Battalion undertook a period of training before finally being <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> last campaign {{of the war in}} mid-1945. This campaign saw them take part in the amphibious landings at Balikpapan on 1 July 1945. During the initial landings early on 1 July, the 2/14th came ashore at the wrong place, landing at Yellow Beach when it had been scheduled to land at Green Beach. Nevertheless, the landing was largely unopposed and after 45 minutes of reorganisation the Australians were able to establish themselves at their correct form up point and begin the advance to their first objective: the bridge over the Klandasan Besar. Advancing unopposed they crossed the bridge and at nightfall dug-in in front of the Stalkudo ridge, along the Vasey Highway. The following day, the battalion captured the Sepinggang airstrip as the 21st Brigade began the advance to the east. The 2/27th Battalion subsequently relieved the 2/14th at Sepinggang and on 3 July, the battalion began to move towards the Manggar airstrip. The 21st Brigade then came up against stronger opposition near the Batakan Ketjil River, which held them up until the evening.|$|E

25|$|Lands of the north, {{formerly}} open {{to summer}} seasonal grazing, {{began to be}} taken and transformed into farms. Hence in late spring tribes of pastoral Berbers arrived at what they considered their customary grazing lands, {{only to be told}} that the land was now entirely owned by another, a planter, who refused them permission to graze and water their herds. The new, often large, agricultural operations produced grain for export, which quickly became highly profitable.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} strategic behavior between {{countries that have}} purchasing power {{on the world market}} for a certain good. Tariffs and quotas are not equivalent protection instruments under non-cooperative behavior. Importers would be better off by choosing their policy cooperatively. If production decisions occur before consumption decisions, the ex-ante optimal policy is not time consistent because the ex-post elasticity of the residual foreign export supply is lower than the ex-ante elasticity. However, we show that the importers 2 ̆ 7 inability <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> trade instrument may be welfare superior to the precommitment solution;We derive the equilibrium production policies if importers do not irrevocably <b>commit</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> ex-ante trade policy. Production instruments are not equivalent under noncooperative behavior. Provided trade is restricted with an import quota, the equilibrium production policy is to restrict domestic production below the competitive level. If trade is restricted with an import tariff, the equilibrium production policy may be to subsidize production. We derive conditions under which the ability of each importer to control domestic production increases welfare;In the next part of the dissertation, we endogenize the decision of two policy active importers <b>to</b> either <b>commit</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> import quota or keep the flexibility <b>to</b> revise <b>their</b> ex-ante quota once production decisions are made. Production in both importing countries is subject to an asymmetric random shock. Both policy active importers prefer not <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> trade policy given a sufficiently high degree of variance in production uncertainty. Under certain conditions, there exists an equilibrium where one country <b>commits</b> <b>to</b> its ex-ante quota while the other keeps the flexibility to revise the level of its quota after uncertainty is resolved;Finally, we examine the endogenous choice of trade instrument among two policy active importers. Production and consumption decisions are carried out simultaneously and the producers 2 ̆ 7 cost function is subject to an asymmetric random shock. In a certain world, the equilibrium of the game entails both importers choosing to use an import quota. Under production risk, there exists an equilibrium where one country uses an import quota while the other uses an import tariff...|$|R

25|$|Alcohol myopia {{has also}} been found to affect one’s level of {{commitment}} to a personal goal. Individual commitment to a goal is dependent upon level of personal desire and feasibility of the goal. A person’s ability to appropriately interpret feasibility is inhibited by alcohol myopia. This is because desire is a more salient stimulus than feasibility, causing those experiencing alcohol myopia to ignore the less salient stimulant of feasibility. Because one is less inhibited {{by the prospect of}} unfeasible goals, those under the influences of alcohol myopia tend to feel more <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> goals than sober individuals. Studies testing the relationship between intoxication and level of commitment to goals support the theory that increased goal commitment (despite level of feasibility) is a side effect of alcohol myopia.|$|E
25|$|Williams had {{neglected}} to tell Mansell that Prost had signed for 1993 at {{only the second}} race of the 1992 season in Mexico, a position that Mansell felt {{would be similar to}} their days together at Ferrari. To boot, Ayrton Senna had expressed a strong desire to drive for Williams and even offered to drive for them at no salary (only to later be rebuffed as Prost, whose rivalry with the Brazilian was just as intense as the one he had with Mansell, had a clause written into his contract which enabled him to block Senna's effort). Williams decided that there was little sense in paying the high fees Mansell went on to demand. With the original offer revoked, and with the premiere teams already <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> incumbent drivers, Mansell decided to move on. An 11th hour offer was made to him at the Italian Grand Prix, but by then the damage was done; Mansell retired from F1.|$|E
25|$|Honoring {{his pledge}} to serve only one term, Polk {{declined}} to seek re-election in 1848. However, Polk's actions strongly affected the 1848 race. With Polk {{out of the}} race, the Democratic Party remained fractured along geographic lines, with Senators Cass and Calhoun the leading western and southern candidates, respectively. Former President Van Buren also retained strong support among northeasterners. Polk privately favored Cass as his successor, but resisted becoming closely involved in the election. At the 1848 Democratic National Convention, which lasted from May 22 to May 25, a message from Polk reiterated his absolute refusal to serve a second term. At the convention, Buchanan, Cass, and Supreme Court Justice Levi Woodbury emerged as the main contenders. Cass led after the first ballot, and slowly gained support until he clinched the nomination on the fourth ballot. William Butler, who had replaced Winfield Scott as the commanding general in Mexico City, won the vice presidential nomination. Cass's nomination from many northerners and southerners, each of whom saw Cass as insufficiently <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> position on the slavery issue.|$|E
