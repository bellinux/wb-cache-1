5|$|The {{systems that}} would develop into Typhoon Kujira {{began as a}} broad area of {{convection}} on April6 centered south of Pohnpei and near the equator. At the time, the area of disturbed weather exhibited multiple circulation centers, and thus the system remained generally disorganized. On April8, however, the convection began to consolidate towards a common center within an area of low wind shear. As such, both the Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) and Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) classified the storm system as a tropical depression at 0000UTC on April9. For much of the cyclone's early existence, the low-level circulation center remained east of the primary <b>convection</b> <b>cell</b> as it tracked northward. Nonetheless, the JTWC upgraded the depression to tropical storm intensity just six hours after cyclogenesis, while the JMA continued to classify {{the system as a}} tropical depression.|$|E

50|$|In {{the field}} of fluid dynamics, a <b>convection</b> <b>cell</b> is the {{phenomenon}} that occurs when density differences exist within a body of liquid or gas. These density differences result in rising and/or falling currents, which are the key characteristics of a <b>convection</b> <b>cell.</b> When a volume of fluid is heated, it expands and becomes less dense and thus more buoyant than the surrounding fluid. The colder, denser part of the fluid descends to settle below the warmer, less-dense fluid, and this causes the warmer fluid to rise. Such movement is called convection, and the moving body of liquid {{is referred to as}} a <b>convection</b> <b>cell.</b> This particular type of convection, where a horizontal layer of fluid is heated from below, is known as Rayleigh-Bénard convection. Convection usually requires a gravitational field, but in microgravity experiments, thermal convection has been observed without gravitational effects.|$|E
50|$|Downwelling is {{the process}} of {{accumulation}} and sinking of higher density material beneath lower density material, such as cold or saline water beneath warmer or fresher water or cold air beneath warm air.

The sinking of cold lithosphere at subduction zones is another example of downwelling in plate tectonics.|$|E

50|$|As the {{temperature}} {{difference between the}} top and bottom of the fluid becomes higher, significant differences in fluid parameters other than density may develop in the fluid due to temperature. An example of such a parameter is viscosity, which may begin to significantly vary horizontally across layers of fluid. This breaks the symmetry of the system, and generally changes the pattern of up- and down-moving fluid from stripes to hexagons, as seen at right. Such hexagons are one example of a <b>convection</b> <b>cell.</b>|$|E

As air moves along the ground it absorbs heat, loses density and moves up into the atmosphere. when it is forced into the atmosphere, which has a lower air pressure, it cannot contain as much fluid as at a lower altitude, so it releases its moist air, producing rain. In this process the warm air is cooled; it gains density and falls towards the earth and the cell repeats the cycle.|$|E

50|$|A <b>convection</b> <b>cell,</b> {{also known}} as a Bénard cell is a {{characteristic}} fluid flow pattern in many convection systems. A rising body of fluid typically loses heat because it encounters a cold surface. In liquid this occurs because it exchanges heat with colder liquid through direct exchange. In the example of the Earth's atmosphere, this occurs because it radiates heat. Because of this heat loss the fluid becomes denser than the fluid underneath it, which is still rising. Since it cannot descend through the rising fluid, it moves to one side. At some distance, its downward force overcomes the rising force beneath it, and the fluid begins to descend. As it descends, it warms again and the cycle repeats itself.|$|E

50|$|It is {{a region}} of ancient dark {{material}} that has been broken apart by tectonism and is now surrounded by younger, brighter material that has been upwelling from Ganymede's interior. It {{is thought to be}} some 4 billion years old and is heavily cratered and palimpsested, but also has a unique distribution of furrows and smooth terrain that {{has been the subject of}} conflicting speculation regarding cause or origin. The distribution of smooth terrain on Galileo Regio suggests that the ancient crust of Ganymede was relatively thin in the equatorial region and thickened poleward in this area. The age relationships, morphology, and geometry of the furrow systems do not favor an origin by impact or tidal stressing. A possible, but speculative, origin is crustal uplift caused by a plume-like <b>convection</b> <b>cell</b> in a fluid mantle underlying a thin crust. Stratigraphic and morphologic relationships among furrows and crater palimpsests suggest that palimpsest morphology is largely the result of impact into a rheologically weak crust rather than viscous relaxation.|$|E

[...] With a temperature gradient greater than the minimum, viscosity can dissipate kinetic energy {{as fast as it}} is released by convection due to buoyancy, and a steady state with convection is stable. The steady state with convection is often a pattern of macroscopically visible hexagonal cells with convection up or down in the middle or at the 'walls' of each cell, depending on the temperature dependence of the quantities; in the atmosphere under various conditions it seems that either is possible. (Some details are discussed by Lebon, Jou, and Casas-Vásquez (2008) on pages 143-158.) With a temperature gradient less than the minimum, viscosity and heat conduction are so effective that convection cannot keep going.|$|E
5000|$|Sputnik Planitia {{appears to}} be {{composed}} of ices more volatile, softer and more dense than the water-ice bedrock of Pluto, including nitrogen, carbon monoxide and solid methane. A polygonal <b>convection</b> <b>cell</b> structure is visible {{over much of the}} planitia. No craters have been found, indicating that its surface must be less than 10 million years old. A number of mechanisms are proposed to explain the absence of craters including cryovolcanism (volcanoes erupting volatiles instead of magma), convective overturn, and viscous relaxation - processes that would erase negative topography. Glaciers of what is probably solid nitrogen can be seen flowing from the planitia into adjacent depressions and craters. Nitrogen from the plain appears to have been carried via the atmosphere and deposited in a thin layer of ice on uplands to the east and south of the plain, forming the large bright eastern lobe of Tombaugh Regio. Glaciers appear to be flowing back into the planitia through valleys from these eastern highlands.|$|E
50|$|Natural {{convection}} is a mechanism, or type of heat transport, {{in which}} the fluid motion is not generated by any external source (like a pump, fan, suction device, etc.) but only by density differences in the fluid occurring due to temperature gradients. In natural convection, fluid surrounding a heat source receives heat, becomes less dense and rises. The surrounding, cooler fluid then moves to replace it. This cooler fluid is then heated and the process continues, forming a convection current; this process transfers heat energy {{from the bottom of}} the <b>convection</b> <b>cell</b> to top. The driving force for natural convection is buoyancy, a result of differences in fluid density. Because of this, the presence of a proper acceleration such as arises from resistance to gravity, or an equivalent force (arising from acceleration, centrifugal force or Coriolis effect), is essential for natural convection. For example, natural convection essentially does not operate in free-fall (inertial) environments, such as that of the orbiting International Space Station, where other heat transfer mechanisms are required to prevent electronic components from overheating.|$|E
5000|$|The {{polygonal}} {{structure is}} a sign of convection of the nitrogen/carbon monoxide ice, with ice warmed by heat from the interior welling up in the center of cells, spreading and then sinking at the ridged margins. <b>Convection</b> <b>cells</b> have about 100 m of vertical relief, with the highest points being at their centers.
