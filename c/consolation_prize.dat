5|$|Any {{contestant}} who answers one of {{the first}} five questions incorrectly still receives a $1,000 <b>consolation</b> <b>prize,</b> contrary to what the home audience is told.

5|$|Before 1984, {{all three}} contestants {{received}} their winnings in cash (contestants who finished with $0 or a negative score received consolation prizes). This was changed {{in order to}} make the game more competitive, and avoid the problem of contestants who would stop participating in the game, or avoid wagering in Final Jeopardy!, rather than risk losing the money they had already won. From 1984 to 2002, non-winning contestants on the Trebek version received vacation packages and merchandise, which were donated by manufacturers as promotional consideration. The current cash <b>consolation</b> <b>prize</b> is provided by Geico.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} week, United traveled up the Interstate 95 {{corridor to}} take on their Atlantic Cup rivals, Red Bull New York. The Red Bulls, previously thrashed United 4–0 in April, and looked to be heavy favorites by fans and the media alike, especially coming off a 5–0 home win over Toronto. During the 61st minute of play, De Rosario scored against his former club to give United a 1–0 advantage, which ended up being the match-winning goal. The win means that the Red Bulls have failed to defeat United at home since 2008. In spite of the win, United failed to win the Atlantic Cup trophy {{for the second consecutive}} year, losing 4–1 on aggregate. However, despite winning the Cup for the second straight year, Red Bulls players found the <b>consolation</b> <b>prize</b> as nothing worth meriting about. D.C. continued their streak the following week, drawing 0–0 to FC Dallas at Pizza Hut Park.|$|E
5|$|The top scorer(s) in {{each game}} retain {{the value of}} their {{winnings}} in cash, and return to play in the next match.

Since the show does not generally provide airfare or lodging for contestants, cash <b>consolation</b> <b>prizes</b> alleviate contestants' financial burden.

25|$|After {{the eighth}} {{week of the}} NFL season, CBS Sports decided that Summerall meshed more with Madden than Scully did and it named {{him to be the}} {{announcer}} who would call Super Bowl XVI for CBS on January 24, 1982, at the Pontiac Silverdome. An angry Scully, who felt that his intelligence had been insulted by the move, was assigned as a <b>consolation</b> <b>prize</b> that year's , which he called alongside Stram. Summerall took Stram's place alongside Jack Buck to call the game over CBS Radio.|$|E
25|$|The Super Match {{was played}} {{similar to the}} 1978–82 version of the round, {{beginning}} with the Audience Match. Initially the payouts {{were the same as}} on the 1970s series, with the top answer worth $500, the second $250, and the third $100. The $50 <b>consolation</b> <b>prize</b> for not coming up with a top three answer that had debuted on Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour was kept for this series. After several weeks, the second and third place answers increased to $300 and $200 and the consolation amount doubled to $100.|$|E
25|$|The season {{centred on}} the six-Test Ashes series against Australia. England won the first, at Edgbaston, by the decisive margin of nine wickets, and the rain-affected second Test at Lord's was drawn, but any English {{optimism}} was short-lived. Australia won {{the next three}} games by huge margins to secure the series and retain The Ashes, and England's three-day victory in the final game at The Oval {{was little more than}} a <b>consolation</b> <b>prize.</b> It was the 68th test series between the two sides with Australia finally winning 4-1. The three-match ODI series which preceded the Tests produced a statistical curiosity, with England winning each match by an identical margin, six wickets.|$|E

25|$|The {{season was}} one of transition. On 18 November, Roy Keane officially left the club, his {{contract}} ended by mutual consent. United failed {{to qualify for the}} knock-out phase of the UEFA Champions' League. In the January transfer window, Serbian defender Nemanja Vidić and French full-back Patrice Evra were signed, and the side finished in second place in the league, behind runaway leaders Chelsea. Winning the League Cup was a <b>consolation</b> <b>prize</b> for lack of success elsewhere.

25|$|After {{the first}} {{contestant}} has either answered all five questions or {{run out of}} time, the host reveals {{how many people in}} the survey matched each of his/her answers.

The same rules are followed, but the time limit is extended by five seconds (originally 20, then extended to 25); in addition, if the second contestant duplicates an answer given by the first, a buzzer sounds and he/she must give another answer. If the two contestants reach a combined total of 200 points or more, the family wins the bonus. If not, they are given $5 per point scored as a <b>consolation</b> <b>prize.</b>|$|E

Flying at speeds averaging 100 miles per hour, she steered her single-engine plane to the finish-line before {{any of the other}} competitors.

She received a <b>consolation</b> <b>prize</b> of 200 Egyptian pounds and the congratulations of King Fuad for her attempt. Huda Sha'arawi, a feminist leader, also sent salutations for the inspiration Elnadi provided and then held a fundraising drive to buy Elnadi a plane of her own. Elnadi worked as the secretary general of the Egyptian Aviation Club and flew for about five years before she was injured in an accident which damaged her spine.|$|E

The organisation was viewed favorably by the colonial administration for its attachment to Belgian social ideals, though it would later become a forum for revolutionary politics. In 1954 Bolikango founded and, for a time, served as general chairman of the Liboka Lya Bangala, the first Bangala ethnic association, based in Léopoldville. By 1957 it encompassed 48 affiliated tribal organisations and had 50,000 members.

Bolikango soon befriended Joseph Kasa-Vubu and sponsored his election as secretary-general of ADAPÉS in order to bring him into UNISCO, thereby furthering the latter's political standing. Bolikango eventually married a woman named Claire. He also obtained a carte de mérite civique from the Belgian administration.|$|E
