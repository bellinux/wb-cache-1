40|$|This article {{argues that}} the emancipatory value of a basic income is greater than its {{monetary}} value, drawing {{on the results of}} a large-scale basic income scheme conducted in the Indian State of Madhya Pradesh between 2010 and 2013. The scheme was evaluated by comparing households in villages where everyone received a small cash payment each month with households in similar villages where no one did. The evaluation results showed much stronger than anticipated benefits of a very modest basic income, equivalent to about a third of subsistence. It is argued here that this arises because cash payments alleviate the <b>contrived</b> <b>scarcity</b> of money itself, a cause of chronic indebtedness and impoverishment. Using data and illustrative case studies on debt, savings and financial inclusion, the article demonstrates how a basic income improves economic security beyond its monetary value, which can be termed its emancipatory value. It further concludes that a basic income would have an emancipatory effect for the growing precariat around the world...|$|E
50|$|An early example' {{was enacted}} during the Roman Republic around 50 B.C. To protect the grain trade, heavy fines were imposed on anyone directly, deliberately, and insidiously {{stopping}} supply ships. Under Diocletian in 301 A.D., an edict imposed {{the death penalty}} for anyone violating a tariff system, for example by buying up, concealing, or <b>contriving</b> the <b>scarcity</b> of everyday goods. More legislation came under the constitution of Zeno of 483 A.D., which can be traced into Florentine Municipal laws of 1322 and 1325. This provided for confiscation of property and banishment for any trade combination or joint action of monopolies private or granted by the Emperor. Zeno rescinded all previously granted exclusive rights. Justinian I subsequently introduced legislation to pay officials to manage state monopolies.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{example of}} modern competition law's ancestors {{appears in the}} Lex Julia de Annona, enacted during the Roman Republic around 50 BC. To protect the corn trade, heavy fines were imposed on anyone directly, deliberately and insidiously stopping supply ships. Under Diocletian, in 301 AD an Edict on maximum prices established a death penalty for anyone violating a tariff system, for example by buying up, concealing or <b>contriving</b> the <b>scarcity</b> of everyday goods. The most legislation came under the Constitution of Zeno of 483 AD which can be traced into Florentine Municipal laws of 1322 and 1325. It provided for property confiscation and banishment for any trade combinations or joint action of monopolies private or granted by the Emperor. Zeno rescinded all previously granted exclusive rights. Justinian I also introduced legislation not long after to pay officials to manage state monopolies. As Europe slipped into the Dark Ages, so did the records of law making until the Middle Ages brought greater expansion of trade {{in the time of}} lex mercatoria.|$|R
