50|$|Manufacturing {{standards}} for pipes commonly require {{a test of}} chemical composition {{and a series of}} mechanical strength tests for each heat of pipe. A heat of pipe is all forged from the same cast ingot, and therefore had the same chemical composition. Mechanical tests may be associated to a lot of pipe, which would be all from the same heat and have been through the same heat treatment processes. The manufacturer performs these tests and reports the composition in a mill traceability report and the mechanical tests in a material test report, both of which are referred to by the acronym MTR. Material with these associated test reports is called traceable. For critical applications, third party verification of these tests may be required; in this case an independent lab will produce a <b>certified</b> <b>material</b> test report(CMTR), and the material will be called certified.|$|E

The procedural method was validated through the estimation of trueness, extract yield, precision, detection, and quantification limits of analytical method. The sample preparation was also evaluated through qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the matrix effect.

The simulation of the 14 MeV neutron activation gamma ray spectra {{has been carried out}} both for cyclic and conventional modes.

40|$|Atmospheric {{nanoparticles}} (NPs) {{are often}} contained in aggregates or included in larger particles. We show {{that some of}} these structures can be crushed in water media by the application of ultrasounds, leading to a suspension of insoluble NPs. The contribution of these NPs to the total elemental concentration is evaluated as the difference between the inductively coupled plasma (ICP-MS) analysis before and after the elution of the suspension from an ion exchange cartridge. Total elemental content in PM can be therefore fractionated into three contributions -soluble species, solid NPs released from larger structures, insoluble particles -that may likely have different health and environmental effects. The method was applied to both <b>Certified</b> <b>Material</b> NIST 1649 a and size-segregated atmospheric PM samples collected by a 13 -stage impactor. The results indicate that alkaline and alkaline earth metals are found in the suspension only as watersoluble species, also when they are contained in the fine fraction of PM. Instead, a significant fraction of most elements typically emitted from combustion sources (Pb, Sb, Sn, Cd, V and As) is present in fine PM as insoluble nanoparticles that are easily dispersed in water under ultrasound application...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a new {{electronically}} controlled year-round wet-only sampler for wet deposition of trace organic compounds (e. g. airborne PAHs) is described. The sampler provides in situ filtration of the precipitation {{as well as}} preconcentration of nonpolar organic compounds {{by means of a}} C 18 -PAH modified silica gel cartridge. The whole assembly is insulated and equipped with heating elements which permit collection of wet deposition as ice or snow and insure correct function of the sampling system even during cold weather. Concurrent chemical analysis of both the particulate and the dissolved phases is performed by high resolution gas chromatography with flame ionization detection or HPLC with fluorescence detection. The reliability of the method was proved by analyzing PAH spiked water (simulated rain) and using NIST SRM 1649 ('urban dust') as <b>certified</b> <b>material</b> for particle-bound PAHs in precipitation. This study proved satisfactorily recoveries of as both particle-bound and unbound aqueous PAH, with only small losses to collector surfaces. It was proved that this new wet-only precipitation sampler can successfully be used for long-time monitoring of PAH in wet depositions in urban areas. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.
