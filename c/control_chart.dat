Deming found great inspiration {{in the work of}} Shewhart, the originator of the concepts of statistical control of processes and the related technical tool of the <b>control</b> <b>chart,</b> as Deming began to move toward the application of statistical methods to industrial production and management. Shewhart's idea of common and special causes of variation led directly to Deming's theory of management.

This key insight made possible his enormous influence on the economics of the industrialized world after 1950.|$|E

40|$|The article {{considers}} the variable process control scheme for two dependent process steps with incorrect adjustment. Incorrect adjustment {{of a process}} may result in shifts in process mean, ultimately affecting the quality of products. We construct variable sample size and variable sampling interval (VSSI) <b>control</b> <b>charts</b> to effectively monitor the quality variable produced by the first process step with incorrect adjustment and the quality variable produced by the second process step with incorrect adjustment. The performance of the proposed VSSI <b>control</b> <b>charts</b> {{is measured by the}} adjusted average time to signal (AATS) derived using a Markov chain approach. An example of the automobile braking system with incorrect adjustment shows the application and performance of the proposed VSSI <b>control</b> <b>charts</b> in detecting shifts in process mean. Furthermore, the performance of the specified VSSI <b>control</b> <b>charts,</b> the optimum VSSI and the fixed sample size and sampling interval (FSSI) <b>control</b> <b>charts</b> are compared by numerical analysis results.
