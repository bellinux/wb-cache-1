5|$|Poole Hospital {{is a large}} NHS Foundation Trust {{hospital}} in Longfleet with 638 beds. It opened in 1969 as Poole General Hospital, replacing Poole's Cornelia Hospital which had stood on the site since 1907. The hospital is the major trauma center for East Dorset and provides core services such as <b>child</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> maternity for a catchment area including Bournemouth and Christchurch. Specialist services such as neurological care and cancer treatment are also provided {{for the rest of}} Dorset. The South Western Ambulance Service provides emergency patient transport.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difference}} between older and newer studies {{is that the}} type of patients treated with the ketogenic diet has changed over time. When first developed and used, the ketogenic diet was not a treatment of last resort; in contrast, the children in modern studies have already tried and failed a number of anticonvulsant drugs, so may be assumed to have more difficult-to-treat epilepsy. Early and modern studies also differ because the treatment protocol has changed. In older protocols, the diet was initiated with a prolonged fast, designed to lose 5–10% body weight, and heavily restricted the calorie intake. Concerns over <b>child</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> growth led to a relaxation of the diet's restrictions. Fluid restriction was once a feature of the diet, but this led to increased risk of constipation and kidney stones, and is no longer considered beneficial.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, {{traditional}} midwives {{came under fire}} {{in what has been}} called the “midwife problem” when they became scapegoats for American’s high infant mortality rate. Despite findings from the White House Conference on <b>Child</b> <b>Health</b> <b>and</b> Protection, the committee on the Costs of Medical Care, and the New York Academy of Medicine that point to physicians rather than midwives as the cause of these high mortality rates, many still blamed midwives for their “ignorant” and “dirty” ways. Scholars believe these traditional midwives became an easy target because of their status as African Americans or immigrants. Additionally, these early midwives lacked formal training, which made physicians even more suspicious of their practice.|$|E
25|$|The Lililwan Project had two {{distinct}} stages.

Stage 2 commenced in May 2011, and involved conducting <b>child</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> development tests, and making opportunistic medical treatments and referrals. This stage included examinations by doctors and other health professionals of all children in the study born in 2003 and 2003 to determine the prevalence of FASD. A health plan was developed for every child diagnosed with the disorder to ensure they received suitable ongoing care.|$|E
