5|$|Leading {{up to the}} Summer Olympics, Solo {{received}} a public warning from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) after a June 15 urine test concluded the banned substance <b>Canrenone</b> had been detected. Solo {{said in a statement}} she had been prescribed a pre-menstrual medication and was not aware it contained any banned substances. She cooperated with the USADA and provided them with the necessary information to prove that it was a mistake. Her story checked out and she was cleared with a public warning.

25|$|<b>Canrenone</b> is an {{antagonist}} of the MR {{similarly to}} spironolactone, but is slightly more potent in comparison. In addition, <b>canrenone</b> inhibits steroidogenic enzymes such as 11β-hydroxylase, cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, 17α-hydroxylase, and 21-hydroxylase similarly to spironolactone, {{but once again}} is more potent in doing so in comparison. In vitro, <b>canrenone</b> binds to and blocks the AR. However, relative to spironolactone, <b>canrenone</b> is described as having very weak affinity to the AR. In accordance, replacement of spironolactone with <b>canrenone</b> in male patients {{has been found to}} reverse spironolactone-induced gynecomastia, suggesting that <b>canrenone</b> is comparatively much less potent in vivo as an antiandrogen. As such, based on the above, the antiandrogen effects of spironolactone are considered to be largely due to other metabolites rather than due to <b>canrenone.</b>|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone and its {{metabolite}} <b>canrenone</b> {{are highly}} plasma protein bound, with percentages of 88.0% and 99.2%, respectively. Spironolactone is bound equivalently to albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein, while <b>canrenone</b> is bound only to albumin. Spironolactone and its metabolite 7α-thiospironolactone show very low or negligible affinity for sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). In accordance, {{a study of}} high-dosage spironolactone treatment found no change in steroid binding capacity related to SHBG or to corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), suggesting that spironolactone does not displace steroid hormones from their carrier proteins. This is in contradiction with widespread statements that spironolactone increases free estradiol levels by displacing estradiol from SHBG.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone {{is rapidly}} and {{extensively}} metabolized {{in the liver}} upon oral administration and has a short terminal half-life of 1.4 hours. The major metabolites of spironolactone are 7α-thiomethylspironolactone (7α-TMS), 6β-hydroxy-7α-thiomethylspironolactone (6β-OH-7α-TMS), and <b>canrenone</b> (7α-desthioacetyl-δ6-spironolactone), and these metabolites have much longer half-lives in comparison (13.8 hours, 15.0 hours, and 16.5 hours, respectively). These metabolites {{are responsible for the}} therapeutic effects of spironolactone, and for this reason, spironolactone is a prodrug. Until fairly recently, the 7α-thiomethylated metabolites of spironolactone had not been identified and it was thought that <b>canrenone</b> was the major active metabolite. However, they have since been characterized and 7α-TMS has been identified as the major metabolite of spironolactone.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{determined}} that 7α-TMS accounts for around 80% of the potassium-sparing effect of spironolactone while <b>canrenone</b> only accounts for the remaining approximate 10 to 25%. In accordance, 7α-TMS occurs at higher circulating concentrations than does <b>canrenone</b> and has a higher relative affinity for the MR. Other known but more minor metabolites of spironolactone include 7α-thiospironolactone (7α-TS), {{as well as the}} 7α-methyl ethyl ester of spironolactone and the 6β-hydroxy-7α-methyl ethyl ester of spironolactone. In addition to the MR, 7α-TS and 7α-TMS have been found to possess approximately equivalent affinity for the rat prostate AR relative to that of spironolactone, thus likely accounting for the retention of the antiandrogenic activity of spironolactone.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone {{is closely}} {{structurally}} related to other clinically used spirolactones such as <b>canrenone,</b> potassium canrenoate, drospirenone, and eplerenone, {{as well as}} to the never-marketed spirolactones SC-5233 (6,7-dihydrocanrenone; 7α-desthioacetylspironolactone), SC-8109 (19-nor-6,7-dihydrocanrenone), spiroxasone, prorenone (SC-23133), mexrenone (SC-25152, ZK-32055), dicirenone (SC-26304), spirorenone (ZK-35973), and mespirenone (ZK-94679).|$|E
25|$|According to {{systematic}} review, {{in heart}} failure with preserved ejection fraction, treatment with spironolactone {{did not improve}} patient outcomes. This {{is based on the}} TOPCAT Trial examining this issue, which found that of those treated with placebo had a 20.4% incidence of negative outcome vs 18.6% incidence of negative outcome with spironolactone. However, because the p-value of the study was 0.14, and the unadjusted hazard ratio was 0.89 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.77 to 1.04, it is determined the finding had no statistical significance. Hence the finding that patient outcomes are not improved with use of spironolactone. More recently, when blood samples from 366 patients in the TOPCAT study were analyzed for presence of <b>canrenone</b> (an active metabolite of spironolactone), 30% of blood samples from Russia lacked detectable residues of <b>canrenone.</b> This led {{to the conclusion that the}} TOPCAT trial results in Russia don't reflect actual clinical experience with spironolactone in patients with preserved ejection fraction. The TOPCAT study results are now considered to have been invalidated. The study's prime investigator and other prominent research cardiologists are now advising physicians treating heart failure with preserved ejection fraction to consider prescribing spironolactone pending outcome of two multicenter trials of newer medications.|$|E
25|$|Although {{spironolactone}} {{is known}} to possess the above activities, {{it should be noted}} that the drug is a prodrug, with active metabolites such as 7α-thiomethylspironolactone (7α-TMS) and <b>canrenone</b> being responsible for its clinical effects. For this reason, the actual in vivo clinical profile of spironolactone may differ from the activities and effective and inhibitory concentrations described above and to the right. In any case, interaction with both the MR and AR have been observed for metabolites of spironolactone. On the other hand, spironolactone itself has only very low affinity for the ER, suggesting that its metabolites may be responsible for this activity.|$|E
25|$|Due to its {{antiandrogen}} properties, spironolactone {{can cause}} effects associated with low androgen levels and hypogonadism in males. For this reason, men are typically not prescribed spironolactone for any {{longer than a}} short period of time, e.g., for an acute exacerbation of heart failure. A newer drug, eplerenone, has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of heart failure, and lacks the antiandrogen effects of spironolactone. As such, it is far more suitable for men for whom long-term medication is being chosen. However, eplerenone may not be as effective as spironolactone or the related drug <b>canrenone</b> in reducing mortality from heart failure.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone is {{considered}} Pregnancy Category C {{meaning that it}} is unclear if it is safe for use during pregnancy. It is able to cross the placenta. Likewise, {{it has been found}} to be present in the breast milk of lactating mothers and, while the effects of spironolactone or its metabolites have not been extensively studied in breastfeeding infants, it is generally recommended that women also not take the drug while nursing. However, only very small amounts of spironolactone and its metabolite <b>canrenone</b> enter breast milk, and the amount received by an infant during breastfeeding (<0.5% of the mother's dose) {{is considered}} to be insignificant.|$|E
