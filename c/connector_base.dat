40|$|Software {{connectors}} {{is one of}} {{key word}} in enterprise information system. In recent years, software developers have facing more challenges of connectors which are used to connect distributed components. Design of connectors in an existing system encounters many issues such as choosing the <b>connectors</b> <b>based</b> on scenario quality, matching these connectors with design pattern, and implementing them. Especially, we concentrate on identifying the attributes that interest an observer, identifying the functions where these connectors could be applied, and keeping all applications clean after adding new connectors.

40|$|Abstract: In current {{software}} systems, connectors play {{an important}} role by encapsulating the communication and coordination logic. Since they share common patterns (elements) depending on characteristics of the connections, the elements can be predefined and reused. A method of <b>connector</b> implementation <b>based</b> on a composition of predefined elements naturally comprises two steps – resolution of the connector architecture, and creation of the actual <b>connector</b> code <b>based</b> on the architecture. However, manual resolution of a connector architecture is not feasible due to the number of factors to be considered. Thus, the challenge is {{to come up with an}} automated method, able to address all the important factors. In this paper, we present a method for automated resolution of <b>connector</b> architectures <b>based</b> on constraint solving techniques (ARCAS). We exploit the Alloy modeling language for defining a connector theory, reflecting both the predefined parts and the important resolution factors, and employ a constraint solver to find a suitable connector architecture as a model of the theory...|$|R

We present a generic high-speed and delay-insensitive <b>connector</b> <b>based</b> on asynchronous four state logic (FSL).

Consequently, it removes timing constraints and even enables local optimizations. Second, this approach only requires {{a small number of}} interfacing signals, thus reducing the routing resources needed between data source and sink. Furthermore, the proposed architecture does not require customized delay lines and thus suits well for both ASIC and FPGA platforms. A modified FlexRay bus analyzer tool has been used to illustrate the advantages of our approach: High-speed and delayinsensitive data communication between different clock domains. ...|$|R
