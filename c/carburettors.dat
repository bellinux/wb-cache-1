5|$|The only {{abnormality}} {{found in}} all four engines was the vapour vent float in the fuel strainer chamber of the <b>carburettors.</b> The floats had been crushed by extreme fuel pressure. Inquiries {{were made to the}} engine manufacturer and other civil aviation authorities but none had prior experience of vapour vent floats collapsing. Tests on <b>carburettors</b> were also carried out in Australia by the Aeronautical Research Laboratories but without finding any suitable explanation. Whether the floats were crushed in flight or in the crash could not be determined, but even if it had occurred in flight it would not have affected operation of the engines.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to make the vehicle stand out in the market against similar rivals, which {{included}} its own derivatives, Peugeot added a more glamorous two-door cabriolet to the standard three-door hatchback. Although announced at the hatchback's launch, the first models were not available until 1982. Designed and built by the Italian coachbuilder Pininfarina, who had been building open-top Peugeots since the 1960s, it came only with the 1360cc engine; two engine versions were offered, 53 or 59kilowatts (72 or 80PS)—the former was dropped after 1984, at which time a slightly revised cabriolet was released featuring the later style 104 dashboard, twin <b>carburettors</b> and a lined hood; the 80bhp engine was shared with the Rallye. At the time of its launch it was the only cabrio small car available from the manufacturer, although other models subsequently entered the market segment created by the Samba, including PSA's own Citroën Visa Decapotable. Pininfarina built 13,062Samba cabriolets.|$|E
25|$|Petrol-fuelled Range Rovers were {{fitted with}} <b>carburettors</b> until 1986, {{when they were}} {{replaced}} by Lucas electronic fuel injection, improving both performance and fuel economy. The Lucas injection system continued to evolve {{over the next several}} years, culminating in the 1990 to 1995 Lucas 14CUX. Some export markets retained <b>carburettors,</b> with the original Zenith/Stromberg manufactured units being replaced by Skinners Union (SU)-manufactured items.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Modern {{passenger}} vehicles with gasoline engines {{are provided with}} different compensating devices for fuel air mixture supply. Even {{then there is a}} high fuel consumption because of many factors. One of the important factors that affect the fuel consumption is that design of <b>carburettor.</b> The venturi of the <b>carburettor</b> is important as it provides a necessary pressure drop in the <b>carburettor</b> device. Since different SI engine use alternative fuels such as LPG, CNG in the present day to reduce the pollution and fuel consumption. Still for a better economy and uniform fuel air supply {{there is a need to}} design the <b>carburettor</b> with an effective analytical tool or software. In this work two parameters namely pressure drop and fuel discharge nozzle angle of the <b>carburettor</b> will be analyzed using computational fluid dynamics. CFD analysis of the <b>carburettor</b> has been done by solid works and results obtained are used for optimum design of a <b>carburettor...</b>|$|R
5000|$|He {{acquired}} {{his first}} car in 1898 and actively {{participated in the}} development of the petrol engine. [...] Herbert with his brother Carl, Thomas Carlisle Skinner (1882-1958), made a newly developed <b>carburettor</b> in 1904. In February 1905 Herbert applied for a full patent which was granted in January 1906. [...] The new <b>carburettor</b> was made for the Skinner brothers by G Wailes & Co of Euston Road until the brothers formed a limited liability company in August 1910 to manufacture it themselves. The original brand name Union <b>Carburettor</b> was changed to S. U. <b>carburettor,</b> an abbreviation of Skinner-Union. Younger brother, Carl (Thomas Carlisle) Skinner (1882-1958) sold out of Lilley & Skinner and took over the <b>carburettor</b> business. Herbert remained with Lilley and Skinner and continued to patent improvements to his <b>carburettor.</b>|$|R
25|$|In Europe {{this version}} was also sold with 1.6 L engine used in series 3, it was fitted with Weber 40DCOM4/5 <b>carburettors.</b>|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time that the Diesel Turbo was {{introduced}} the V8 engine was upgraded. Power was increased to , and SU <b>carburettors</b> replaced the Zenith models used on earlier V8s.|$|E
25|$|The Jankovits fitted {{exhaust pipes}} of equal length and {{improved}} intake of air {{to reduce the}} pressure drop. Later the engine was upgraded with three dual Weber 36 D 04 <b>carburettors,</b> a setup used on the 6C 2500 SS of 1939.|$|E
5000|$|The JB {{and early}} JD which were <b>carburettor</b> equipped, {{suffered}} from premature {{failure of the}} [...] "sandwich mount" [...] located between the <b>carburettor</b> and intake manifold.|$|R
5000|$|The 1.5 L (1489 cc) {{version was}} first used in 1953 in the MG Magnette ZA in twin <b>carburettor</b> version and in 1954 in the Morris Oxford series II and Austin Cambridge. In 1957, it {{was used in the}} {{original}} MGA. Output in twin <b>carburettor</b> form was [...] and [...] with a single <b>carburettor.</b> Bore was 73.03 mm and stroke was 89 mm.|$|R
50|$|The {{beauty of}} the SU lies in its {{simplicity}} and lack of multiple jets and ease of adjustment. Adjustment is accomplished by altering the starting position of the jet relative to the needle on a fine screw (26TPI for most pre-HIF versions). At first sight, the principle appears to bear a similarity {{to that of the}} slide <b>carburettor,</b> which was previously used on many motorcycles. The slide <b>carburettor</b> has the same piston and main needle as an SU <b>carburettor,</b> however the piston/needle position is directly actuated by a physical connection to the throttle cable rather than indirectly by venturi airflow as with an SU <b>carburettor.</b> This piston actuation difference is the significant distinction between a slide and an SU <b>carburettor.</b> The piston in a slide <b>carburettor</b> is controlled by the operator's demands rather than the demands of the engine. This means that the metering of the fuel can be inaccurate unless the vehicle is travelling at a constant speed at a constant throttle setting - conditions rarely encountered except on motorways. This inaccuracy results in fuel waste, particularly as the <b>carburettor</b> must be set slightly rich to avoid a lean condition (which can cause engine damage). For this reason Japanese motorcycle manufacturers ceased to fit slide carbs and substituted constant-depression carbs, which are essentially miniature SUs. It is also possible - indeed, easy - to retrofit an SU <b>carburettor</b> to a bike that was originally manufactured with a slide <b>carburettor,</b> and obtain improved fuel economy and more tractable low-speed behaviour.|$|R
25|$|While in Europe the 1750 {{was fitted}} with two twin {{horizontal}} <b>carburettors,</b> starting with model year 1969 {{models for the}} North American market had SPICA (Società Pompe Iniezione Cassani & Affini, a subsidiary of Alfa Romeo) mechanical fuel injection. According to Alfa Romeo engine output and performance were unchanged from the carburetted version.|$|E
25|$|In April 1975, the North American Series II got a {{slightly}} revised set of front bumpers which had rubber over-riders covering {{the full length}} of the bumper with embedded turn signals at each end. In 1975 V12 XJS / XJ12L cars and in 1978 the 4.2 6 cyl. XJ6L North American cars got the addition of Bosch-Lucas electronic fuel injection in the place of Zenith-Stromberg <b>carburettors.</b>|$|E
25|$|The CB400A has a {{two-speed}} semi-automatic transmission. It has a {{torque converter}} and two forward gears (high and low) {{that have to}} be manually selected by the rider. There is a gear position indicator in lieu of a tachometer in the instrument binnacle. A parking brake replaced the clutch lever. This model has 28mm Keihin <b>carburettors</b> which lower the peak power in exchange for low-down response.|$|E
50|$|The Vanden Plas {{models were}} rebranded as the 1.5 and the 1.7, the 1.5 having a twin <b>carburettor</b> 1500 cc engine and a manual gearbox, while the 1.7 {{had a single}} <b>carburettor</b> 1750cc engine and an {{automatic}} gearbox.|$|R
50|$|The only {{engine to}} use a <b>carburettor</b> is the four-cylinder M10 used in the 518, which is fitted with a Pierburg 2B4 <b>carburettor.</b> The {{slightly}} inclined engine is mounted on the front axle bracket and screwed to the gearbox.|$|R
2500|$|In 1961, the 3.2 and 3.2 Super were {{replaced}} by the 3200L and 3200S respectively. [...] The 3200L had a single <b>carburettor</b> engine that produced , while the 3200S had a twin <b>carburettor</b> engine that produced [...] at 5600 revolutions per minute.|$|R
25|$|Returning to England {{after the}} War he was demobilised in June 1919. His first post-War job was with Aston Motor Accessories of Wolverhampton. He {{then moved to}} AMAC <b>Carburettors</b> and began again to ride {{part-time}} for AJS. He joined the AJS team for the 1920 Isle of Man TT, and was entered for both the Junior and Senior. The 2.75hp AJS machines suffered engine problems {{and he had to}} retire early in both events with broken valves.|$|E
25|$|The City of Khartoum (G-AASJ) {{suffered}} a catastrophic failure {{of all three}} engines shortly {{before the end of}} its flight between Crete and Alexandria, Egypt, just after nightfall on 31 December 1935. The pilot was the only survivor; nine passengers and three crew were killed either by the impact with water or by drowning when the aircraft was overwhelmed by heavy waves. An inquiry by the British Air Ministry found that the <b>carburettors</b> had been altered in a way which increased fuel consumption, resulting in the aircraft running out of fuel.|$|E
25|$|The Manitou was {{a further}} {{development}} of the V-12 Maori III. Work on it began by Louis Coatalen in 1917. It used aluminium blocks rather than cast iron, cast in blocks of three cylinders, a typical Sunbeam feature. Bore was increased to 110mm, but stroke remained at 135mm. The banks were at a 60° vee, with twin overhead camshafts on each bank operating four valves per cylinder. There were two Claudel-Hobson <b>carburettors</b> and two British Thomson-Houston (BTH) ignition magnetos. For aircraft use a reduction gear was fitted. The engine developed 300hp at 2,000rpm, later increased to 325hp.|$|E
50|$|June 1968: {{without any}} formal announcement, a more {{powerful}} twin <b>carburettor</b> version of BMC's 1,275 cc engine is fitted to manual gearbox versions of the MG, Riley, Wolseley and Vanden Plas models: automatic transmission versions retained the single <b>carburettor</b> engine.|$|R
5000|$|In 1961, the 3.2 and 3.2 Super were {{replaced}} by the 3200L and 3200S respectively. The 3200L had a single <b>carburettor</b> engine that produced , while the 3200S had a twin <b>carburettor</b> engine that produced [...] at 5600 revolutions per minute.|$|R
50|$|Of the 13,691 New Class coupés built between 1965 {{and the end}} of {{production}} in mid-1969, 9,999 were twin <b>carburettor</b> 2000 CS coupés, 3,249 were single <b>carburettor</b> 2000 C coupés with automatic transmission, and 443 were 2000 C coupés with manual transmission.|$|R
25|$|In 1980, Honda only offered one model, {{designated}} as the Hawk, now simply designated CB400T. The CM400E took {{over the role of}} the cheaper Hawk I. It is similar to the European CB400NA. It has the same European styling and six-speed manual gearbox, although the pegs, footrest and gear lever are in the same position as the earlier Hawk variants. The bike became electric start only. Smaller 30mm Keihin CV <b>carburettors</b> with accelerator pumps were fitted to comply with US emissions controls. The 1981 model is similar to the European CB400NB and has a dual piston front brake caliper, plastic front fender and a different tank shape.|$|E
25|$|With {{the fuel}} {{injection}} replacing the <b>carburettors,</b> the Range Rover became compliant to new US emission regulations. To prepare for US launch, Range Rover of North America {{was established in}} Lanham, Maryland in late 1985, with plans to import Range Rovers through the ports of Baltimore and Long Beach, California, beginning in March 1987, to be sold nationwide through a network of 36 dealers, expanding to 65 by 1988. The Range Rover was officially introduced to the US market in the 1987 LA Auto Show in January and Chicago Auto Show on 7 February. The Range Rover was officially launched to the US market on 16 March 1987, and the first car was sold on the same day.|$|E
25|$|The Alfetta saloon was {{launched}} in 1972, equipped with a 1.8-litre four-cylinder. It was a three-box, four-door notchback saloon (Berlina in Italian) with seating for five designed in-house by Centro Stile Alfa Romeo; the front end was characterised by twin equally sized headlamps connected to a central narrow Alfa Romeo shield by three chrome bars, while the tail lights were formed by three square elements. At the 1975 Brussels Motor Show Alfa Romeo introduced the , 108PS (DIN) Alfetta 1.6 base model, easily recognizable by its single, larger round front headlights. Meanwhile, the 1.8-litre Alfetta was rebadged Alfetta 1.8 and {{a few months later}} mildly restyled, further set apart from the 1.6 by a new grille with a wider central shield and horizontal chrome bars. Engines in both models were Alfa Romeo Twin Cams, with two overhead camshafts, 8-valves and two double-barrel <b>carburettors.</b> Two years later the 1.6 was upgraded to the exterior and interior features of the 1.8.|$|E
50|$|The Carter Thermoquad {{was used}} in this series as well, however not from the start, or at least not all the cars left the factory with one. Some still had the {{previous}} models AVS <b>carburettor.</b> When the <b>carburettor</b> change was implemented is unknown, with some examples having the Thermoquad and later builds still keeping the AVS. There is considered to be an improvement to engine performance as the flow in the <b>carburettor</b> was increased from 625 cfm to 800 cfm for the Thermoquad.|$|R
50|$|The {{flagship}} model was the Custom Royal. It {{came with the}} 350 in³ (5.7 L) Super Red Ram V8 with a standard two-barrel <b>carburettor,</b> but the optional four-barrel <b>carburettor</b> delivered 300 hp (224 kW). One unique feature of the Custom Royal was its bumper-mounted exhaust.|$|R
25|$|The full remedy {{was to use}} the Bendix-Stromberg {{pressure}} <b>carburettor,</b> {{which allowed}} more precise metering {{of the amount of}} fuel used by the engine and prevented fuel starvation. This new <b>carburettor</b> was used from the Merlin 66 series and on all Griffon engines. In these engines the <b>carburettor</b> injected fuel at 5 psi through a nozzle direct into the supercharger and the compressed air-fuel mixture was then directed to the cylinders. The final development was the SU injection <b>carburettor,</b> that injected fuel into the supercharger using a fuel pump driven as a function of crankshaft speed and engine pressures; although this was fitted to the 100 series Merlins, which were not used in production Spitfires, it was used in the Griffon 60 and 80 series.|$|R
25|$|Later in {{the same}} year, the GTV6, {{a version of the}} GTV with the SOHC V6 2.5L engine from the Alfa Romeo Alfa 6 luxury saloon, was released. As a result, the hood {{received}} a bulge to clear the top of the intake and became its most pronounced feature. With Bosch L-Jetronic fuel injection instead of the six downdraught Dell'Orto <b>carburettors</b> in the early Alfa 6 installation, the V6 was much easier to start and retained its state of tune much better. The V6 received rave reviews from the motoring press, which had previously lambasted the same engine in the Alfa 6 because of the carburettor problems. It found its true home in the GTV6 Gran Turismo body where it could stretch its legs better than in the less sporting Alfa 6 saloon. The fuel injection installation eventually made it into the second series of the Alfa 6 as well. The GTV went through a number of revisions, including a new gear ratios and an updated interior in 1984.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} compete in {{international}} rallying, the car had to be homologated; for Group 4, the class the HS was {{to compete in}}, this meant building 400 production vehicles for public sale. Vauxhall created a far more powerful Chevette variant by fitting the 2.3litre slant-four engine, using a 16-valve cylinder head which Vauxhall was developing - though the rally cars used the Lotus 16-valve head until a rule change by the FIA banned them in 1978. Fitted with two Stromberg <b>carburettors</b> the engine developed 135 bhp. Suspension and rear axle were from the Opel Kadett C GT/E and the gearbox was a Getrag five-speed. Chevrolet Vega alloy wheels (similar in appearance to the Avon wheels used on the droopsnoot Firenza) were used, {{as well as a}} newly developed glass-reinforced plastic air dam. The result was a very fast and well handling, if rather unrefined, road car. Like the Droopsnoot Firenza, the HS was available only in silver, with red highlighting and a bright red, black and tartan interior; though (partly to help sell unsold vehicles) some cars were repainted in other colours, such the black Mamos Garage HS-X.|$|E
25|$|The LC10 was {{introduced}} with great fanfare {{and a large}} marketing campaign, which included television commercials. First reaching dealerships on 27 May 1967, market response was immediate and strong. While the original target production was 3000 per month, this was soon nearly tripled. Monthly production remained above 8000 {{until the end of}} the LC10's life. A new, additional factory in Iwata was opened in August 1967 to add supplementary capacity. While in overall a fairly simple and light car, the triple <b>carburettors</b> were awkwardly located at the front of the engine, behind the rear seat. To adjust them, a mechanic would have to reach through a small egg-shaped opening from the rear seat. Another complaint touched on the car's near absence of luggage space. The rear lights and the front indicators used the same lenses, only of different colors. There was even a brochure made of a US-market Fronte 360, complete with miles-per-hour speedo and uncovered sealed-beam headlights, but most likely none were brought over. The Fronte soon received a very minor update reflecting stricter safety laws; as of October 1968 it sported a driver's side integrated headrest, seat belts up front, and turn signal flashers on all four corners.|$|E
