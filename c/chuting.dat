50|$|The {{throw-out}} pilot <b>chute</b> is {{the most}} popular type in use today. The pilot <b>chute</b> is packed in a pouch {{at the bottom of the}} container (often called BOC for short). The handle is attached to the apex of the pilot <b>chute.</b> When the user grabs the handle and throws the pilot <b>chute</b> into the airstream, the bridle extends, pulling the closing pin and opening the container, as the pilot <b>chute</b> continues in the airstream it extracts the deployment bag containing the main parachute from the container. The pull-out pilot <b>chute</b> and the throw-out pilot <b>chute</b> were both invented by Bill Booth.|$|R

5000|$|There are two {{different}} types of specialised crushes used in rodeo arenas. Those for the [...] "rough stock" [...] events, such as bronc riding and bull riding, are known as bucking <b>chutes</b> or rough-riding <b>chutes.</b> For events such as steer roping, the crush is called a roping <b>chute.</b> The rough-riding <b>chutes</b> are notably higher in order to hold horses and adult bulls, and have platforms and rail spacing that allows riders and assistants to access the animal from above. These <b>chutes</b> release the animal and the rider through a side gate. A roping <b>chute</b> is large enough to contain a steer of the size used in steer wrestling and may have a seat above the <b>chute</b> for an operator. The steer or calf is released through the front of the <b>chute.</b>|$|R
40|$|IN MANY FACTORIES, {{the feed}} <b>chute</b> {{of the first}} mill is {{operated}} with a high <b>chute</b> level {{for the purpose of}} maximising the cane rate through the mill. There is a trend towards trying to control <b>chute</b> level within a small control range near the top of a <b>chute</b> that can result in rapid changes in cane feeding rate to maintain the <b>chute</b> level set point. This paper reviews the theory that predicts higher cane rate with higher <b>chute</b> level and discusses the main weakness in the theory that it does not consider the beneficial effect on capacity of cane falling {{from the top of the}} <b>chute</b> to the top surface of the cane mat. An extension to the <b>chute</b> theory model is described that predicts higher capacity with lower <b>chute</b> level because of the effect of the falling cane. The original model and this extended model are believed to be the upper and lower limits to the true effect. The paper reports an experiment that measured the real effect of <b>chute</b> level on capacity and finds that increasing <b>chute</b> level does lead to higher capacity but that the trend is only about one-third as strong as the original theory predicted. The paper questions whether the benefits of slightly greater capacity outweigh the costs of operating with the small control range near the top of the <b>chute...</b>|$|R
40|$|Pressure feeder <b>chutes</b> are {{pieces of}} {{equipment}} used in sugar cane crushing {{to increase the amount}} of cane that can be put through a mill. The continuous pressure feeder was developed with the objective to provide a constant feed of bagasse under pressure to the mouth of the crushing mills. The pressure feeder <b>chute</b> is used in a sugarcane milling unit to transfer bagasse from one set of crushing rolls to a second set of crushing rolls. There have been many pressure feeder <b>chute</b> failures in the past. The pressure feeder <b>chute</b> is quite vulnerable and if the bagasse throughput is blocked at the mill rollers, the pressure build-up in the <b>chute</b> can be enormous, which can ultimately result in failure. The result is substantial damage to the rollers, mill and <b>chute</b> construction, and downtimes of up to 48 hours can be experienced. Part of the problem is that the bagasse behaviour in the pressure feeder <b>chute</b> is not understood well. If the pressure feeder <b>chute</b> behaviour was understood, then the <b>chute</b> geometry design could be modified in order to minimise risk of failure. There are possible avenues for changing pressure feeder <b>chute</b> design and operations with a view to producing more reliable pressure feeder <b>chutes</b> in the future. There have been previous attempts to conduct experimental work to determine the causes of pressure feeder <b>chute</b> failures. There are certain guidelines available, however pressure feeder <b>chute</b> failures continue. Pressure feeder <b>chute</b> behaviour still remains poorly understood. This thesis contains the work carried out between April 14 th 2009 and October 10 th 2012 that focuses on the design of an experimental apparatus to measure forces and visually observe bagasse behaviour in an attempt to understand bagasse behaviour in pressure feeder <b>chutes</b> and minimise the risk of failure...|$|R

40|$|Many {{industrial}} <b>chute</b> {{applications are}} characterised by rapid flow {{conditions in which}} the bulk solid stream thickness or depth {{is less than the}} <b>chute</b> width. Under these conditions, it is possible to describe the stream flow by means of a lumped parameter model which takes into account the frictional drag around the <b>chute</b> boundaries as well as making allowance for inter-particle friction. Equations of motion to describe the <b>chute</b> flow are presented and their application to the determination of <b>chute</b> profiles to achieve optimum flow is illustrated. By means of design examples, the problems associated with the feeding of bulk solids onto belt conveyors and conveyor transfers are discussed. Criteria for the selection of the most appropriate <b>chute</b> geometry to minimise <b>chute</b> wear and belt wear at the feed point are presented.

[...] This separator consisted of an inclined <b>chute</b> with a rough surface, {{at the end of}} which was an opening in the bottom the <b>chute.</b> The heavier slate, ash, and sulphur would slide along the bottom of the <b>chute,</b> picking up friction from the rough surface and falling through the gap in the bottom of the <b>chute,</b> while the lighter coal would have enough velocity to pass over the gap and continue down the <b>chute</b> for further processing.|$|R
40|$|In a rice sorting machine, rice grains drop onto {{and slide}} down an {{anodised}} aluminium <b>chute.</b> The {{purpose of the}} <b>chute</b> is to separate the grains and provide a controlled distribution. At {{the bottom of the}} <b>chute</b> the grains are examined optically and contaminants or defective grains are removed from the stream by jets of air. The machine has the ability to sort low quality rice which contains a large element of contaminants such as husk. The husk is extremely abrasive and this, along with other factors, can lead to a reduction {{in the life of the}} <b>chute</b> by wear of the surface. In this work a failure analysis process was undertaken to establish the nature and causes of the <b>chute</b> surface wear and the mechanisms of material removal. Wear occurs initially at the location where the grains first strike the <b>chute</b> and at subsequent regions down the <b>chute</b> where bounce occurs. An experimental and analytical examination of the rice motion on impacting the <b>chute</b> was also carried out along with some friction testing of potential replacement <b>chute</b> materials. The evidence gathered during the failure analysis along with the experimental analysis was used to propose possible material/design improvements...|$|R
40|$|<b>Chute</b> cutoffs reduce {{sinuosity}} of meandering {{rivers and}} potentially cause {{a transition from}} a single to a multiple channel river. The channel bifurcation of the main channel and {{the mouth of the}} incipient <b>chute</b> channel controls sediment and flow partitioning and development of the <b>chute.</b> Recent channel bifurcation models suggest that upstream bend radius, gradient advantage, inlet step, and upstream sediment supply at the bifurcation are important factors in the evolution of bifurcations. Our objective is to unravel the relative importance of these factors for <b>chute</b> cutoff success and development. We compare results from a morphodynamic three-dimensional (3 D) model and a one-dimensional (1 D) model with nodal-point relation with field observations of <b>chute</b> cutoffs in a meandering gravel-bed river. The balance between increased gradient advantage and flow curvature upstream of the <b>chute</b> channel bifurcation was systematically investigated with the 1 D model. The 3 D model runs and the field observations show the development of two types of <b>chute</b> cutoffs: a scroll-slough cutoff and a bend cutoff. The morphodynamic 3 D model demonstrates that <b>chutes</b> are initiated when flow depth exceeds the floodplain elevation. Overbank flow and a significant gradient advantage result in a bend cutoff. The outcome of the 1 D model shows that channel curvature at the bifurcation determines {{the success or failure of}} the <b>chute</b> cutoff when the <b>chute</b> channel is located at the inner bend, as in the case of scroll-slough cutoffs. We conclude that <b>chute</b> initiation depends on floodplain characteristics, i. e., floodplain elevation, sediment composition, and the presence of vegetation. <b>Chute</b> cutoff success or failure is determined by the dynamics just upstream of the channel bifurcation and location of the <b>chute</b> channel in the bend, which determines channel curvature and gradient advantage. These findings have ramifications for the prediction of <b>chute</b> cutoff in a wide range of rivers under natural and managed conditions and for the understanding of stratigraphy and architecture of deposits. ¬© 2014 Elsevier B.

40|$|A {{simple and}} {{effective}} classification method, the 'chute', {{has been developed}} for the liquid-phase removal of fines from a batch of porous (catalyst) particles in the micrometre range. The <b>chute</b> is a continuous sedimentation fractionator, working in the gravitational field. Equations based an the sedimentation of particles were derived for the particle size distribution density function at a given position on the <b>chute</b> {{as a function of}} the initial size distribution density function. The particle size distribution on the <b>chute</b> appears to be only a function of the physical constants of the fluid, the particles and the dimensions of the <b>chute.</b> To verify the model equations, experiments with the <b>chute</b> were carried out at different suspension flows and <b>chute</b> angles. It was found that the experimental particle size distribution density functions at various positions on the <b>chute</b> were predicted reasonably well.
