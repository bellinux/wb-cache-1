2500|$|He {{requested}} Margaret Russell {{to take a}} vow of chastity if {{she wished}} to inherit his moveable goods {{in addition to her}} <b>customary</b> <b>dower</b> of 1/3 of his real estate. She was however remarried within 7 months, possibly under pressure from Sir Edward Stradling of St. Donat's Castle, Glamorgan, who had obtained the wardship of Morys, her son and Denys's heir. [...] Her new husband, much her junior, was [...] John Kemeys of Began, Monmouth, the young nephew of Stradling. 5 years earlier [...] Stradling's [...] uncle, Sir John Stradling had married Joan Dauntsey, the young widow of Margaret's own father, Sir Morys Russell (d.1416). Sir Edward Stradling married his daughter Katherine to Morys his ward, and Katherine Stradling thereby became matriarch of the Denys line. Denys and Stradling were well known to each other in Glamorgan, and in 1421 Denys had made a quitclaim or General Release to Stradling of his interests in Glamorgan [...] following the death of Sir Roger Berkerolles, Lord of Coity, when much re-shuffling of property occurred. Katherine's mother was Joan, the bastard daughter of Cardinal Henry Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester, and son of John of Gaunt. Denys must have been known to Beaufort since he named him one of the overseers of his will, together with Bishop Philip Morgan of Worcester. [...] It is possible that Stradling had obtained the wardship of Morys Denys through the influence of his father-in-law Beaufort, possibly as part of the marriage settlement, for in the next year, 1423, the marriage of Joan and Stradling took place. Morys was aged 12 in 1422, and the only son of his marriage to Katherine Stradling, Walter, [...] was born in 1437, aging Katherine at just 14 when she became a mother. She seems to have died shortly thereafter as Morys then remarried to Alice Poyntz.|$|E
5000|$|A further legal suit {{heard before}} the Justices Itinerant of King Henry III at Exeter on 24 April 1219 is {{recorded}} between John Malherbe and Sibilla his wife, and widow of Nicholas de Champellis, against William de Champellis; She claimed {{as part of}} her <b>customary</b> <b>dower</b> (comprising 1/3 of her husband's lands) the township of [...] "Harewde" [...] (West Horwood) and [...] "Moulande". William paid her 4 marks of silver to settle her claim and retained possession of the lands.|$|E
50|$|Of dower (douaire) as {{it existed}} in the old French law no trace {{is to be found}} in the {{existing}} law of France. But brought to Canada from the mother country in pre-Revolutionary times, <b>customary</b> <b>dower</b> accruing by operation of law is yet recognized in the law of the former French province of Quebec. The civil death which by English law seems to have applied to men only, might be by the French law incurred by women taking perpetual religious vows. Therefore, a widow entering into religion would lose her dower, although in some regions she was allowed to retain a moderate income. And now by the law of Quebec a widow joining certain religious orders of the province is deemed civilly dead and undoubtedly would suffer loss of dower.|$|E
5000|$|Dower {{by custom}} {{was an attempt}} to {{recognize}} the rules of <b>dower</b> <b>customary</b> at each manor and in each region. <b>Customary</b> <b>dowers</b> were also abolished in the 19th century, and replaced with uniform inheritance laws.|$|R
50|$|Maurice's father, Ralph Russell, died on 13 February 1375, while Maurice {{was still}} a minor, aged 19, two years from his majority. He was granted in {{wardship}} to Sir Robert Assheton (died 1384), his father's cousin, soon to be appointed Treasurer of the Exchequer. Having reached his majority, in December 1377, Maurice took possession of his inheritance, following the early deaths of his two elder brothers, Theobald and John(both fl. 1341), excepting the <b>customary</b> 1/3 <b>dower</b> share retained by his mother Alice, whose family name is unknown, apparently resident at Kingston Russell, who died on 16 March 1388. In 1382, Maurice leased the reversion of Kingston Russell, from his mother's death, to Walter Clopton for 20 marks p.a. Maurice also had a sister, Alice, who married into the Haket family, producing a son John Haket (died 1498).|$|R
5000|$|In 1346/7 Theobald was sued in {{the name}} [...] "de Gorges" [...] by Elizabeth, widow of his uncle Ralph, 2nd Baron Gorges (d.1331), for the manor of Knighton. Judgement was given in her favour, but, as she had no issue by Ralph, the manor reverted to Theobald by 1362. On the death of Theobald in 1380, the manor of Knighton, less a dower {{interest}} of 1/3, passed successively to his sons Sir Randolf (Ralph?) (d.1382), Bartholomew (d.1395/6) and Thomas (d.1404), all of whom chose to use the Gorges family name alone. Theobald's widow Agnes, presumably {{the mother of the}} 3 sons, died in 1400, when her <b>customary</b> <b>dower</b> share of 1/3 reverted to Thomas. Thomas left a son John, who died in 1413 aged only 15, leaving his 10-year-old brother Theobald as heir. In 1462 Sir Theobald Gorges was in possession of Knighton, and probably died without issue as the manor of Knighton reverted via the Russell family to John Haket (d.1498) of Wolverton, Isle of Wight, 1st cousin & heir of Thomas Russell (d.1431) son of Sir Maurice Russell (d.1416).|$|E
50|$|Margaret Russell, {{mother of}} Maurice Denys, {{retained}} {{on the death}} of Gilbert Denys as her <b>customary</b> <b>dower</b> 1/3rd of his lands for life. Thus Edward Stradling had available only the remaining 2/3rds. as his wardship lands. Yet he exerted his influence over the widow Margaret, who had been urged not to remarry but rather to take a vow of chastity in the will of her husband, by procuring her as wife for his young nephew John Kemys from Wentloog, South Wales. Thus the following entry is recorded in the Patent Rolls, dated at Westminster, 12 December 1422, only 7 months after Gilbert Denys's death:“Licence for Margaret late the wife of Gilbert Denys, knight, tenant-in-chief of Henry V, to marry John Kemmes, esquire”This meant that Kemeys himself acquired jure uxoris a life interest in the dower 1/3 of the Denys lands. As Kemeys did not die until 1477, 11 years after Maurice Denys's death, Maurice never lived to enjoy his entire patrimony. It appears that Margaret and John Kemeys resided at Siston, the place of Maurice's birth and the principal Denys manor, which forced Maurice to reside at Alveston, or possibly near to it at Olveston Court, which his father had held at his death from the Bishop of Bath & Wells. Not only did Edward Stradling obtain Margaret as a wife for his nephew, but he had previously obtained Joan Dauntsey, the young 2nd wife and widow of her father, Sir Maurice Russell (d. 1416), as wife for his uncle Sir John Stradling, as the following entry in the Patent Rolls, dated 8 July 1418 at Waltham, records:“Pardon, for 40 marks paid in the hanaper, to John Stradlyng, chivaler, and Joan late the wife of Maurice Russell, chivaler, tenant-in-chief, of their trespass in intermarrying without licence."Joan had as her dowry 1/3rd of the substantial lands of Maurice Russell, and later unexpectedly became the heiress of her brother regarding the Dauntsey lands in Wiltshire.|$|E
5000|$|Denys's {{will was}} dated the Feast of St. Michael the Archangel (16 October 1421), {{and he died}} on 24 March 1422. His will is a very short and businesslike document. [...] He {{requested}} {{to be buried in}} Siston Church, near his first wife Margaret Corbet. The fact that he had appointed his daughter Joan, [...] "wife of Thomas Gamage" [...] as his executrix to arrange this burial, suggests she must have been a daughter of Margaet Corbet, not of his second wife Margaret Russell. This supposition is strengthened by the fact she must have been an adult to be thus appointed, which would place her date of birth before Denys's 2nd. Marriage to Margaret Russell, c. 1408.He requested Margaret Russell to take a vow of chastity if she wished to inherit his moveable goods in addition to her <b>customary</b> <b>dower</b> of 1/3 of his real estate. She was however remarried within 7 months, possibly under pressure from Sir Edward Stradling of St. Donat's Castle, Glamorgan, who had obtained the wardship of Morys, her son and Denys's heir. [...] Her new husband, much her junior, was John Kemeys of Began, Monmouth, the young nephew of Stradling. 5 years earlier Stradling's uncle, Sir John Stradling had married Joan Dauntsey, the young widow of Margaret's own father, Sir Morys Russell (d.1416).

Katherine's mother was Joan, the bastard daughter of Cardinal Henry Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester, and son of John of Gaunt. Denys must have been known to Beaufort since he named him one of the overseers of his will, together with Bishop Philip Morgan of Worcester. It is possible that Stradling had obtained the wardship of Morys Denys through the influence of his father-in-law Beaufort, possibly as part of the marriage settlement, for in the next year, 1423, the marriage of Joan and Stradling took place.
