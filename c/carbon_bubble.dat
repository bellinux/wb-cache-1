5000|$|The <b>carbon</b> <b>bubble</b> is a {{hypothesized}} bubble in the {{valuation of}} companies dependent on fossil-fuel-based energy production, because the true costs {{of carbon dioxide}} in intensifying global warming are not yet {{taken into account in}} a company's stock market valuation. [...] Currently the price of fossil fuels companies' shares is calculated under the assumption that all fossil fuel reserves will be consumed. An estimate made by Kepler Chevreux puts the loss in value of the fossil fuel companies due to the impact of the growing renewables industry at US$28 trillion over the next two decades-long. A more recent analysis made by Citi puts that figure at $100 trillion.|$|E
50|$|Later in 2010, {{their four}} free digital release albums {{were removed from}} their site and {{released}} commercially on iTunes and Amazon. The Crackup Suite was retitled The Crackup Suite Parts 1 and 2 and had six additional tracks added to it (four of which were previously unreleased) and <b>Carbon</b> <b>Bubble</b> had two previously unreleased tracks added to it. Since then, Carbon Silicon has not been active besides a few scattered tours. In early 2013, they commercially released one additional song for download titled Big Surprise (with an accompanying video on YouTube) causing fans to briefly hope that more was to come, {{but it was only}} an outtake from their earlier recordings and it appears that nothing else is in the works at the moment.|$|E
50|$|By 2013, {{there was}} {{significant}} awareness {{in the financial}} industry of {{the risks associated with}} exposure to companies involved in extraction of fossil fuels. In early 2014, the FTSE Group, BlackRock and the Natural Resources Defense Council collaborated {{in the creation of a}} stock market index series that excludes companies linked to exploration, ownership or extraction of carbon-based fossil fuel reserves. These indices are intended to make it easier for investors to steer their investments away from such companies. It has been proposed that companies be required by law to report on their greenhouse gas emissions and assess the risk this could pose to their future financial performance. According to Christiana Figueres, UNFCCC, companies have a duty to shareholders to move to a low-carbon economy, because of the effects of the <b>carbon</b> <b>bubble.</b>|$|E

40|$|Surface {{tension is}} very {{important}} property in petroleum and gas operations. It provide an insight into the understanding most of multiphase fluids behaviour. In this experimental study, the surface tension of methane and <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>bubbles</b> in a confined system due to the variation of pressure and temperature have been investigated. The surface tension was studied within a pressure range of (10 – 110) psig. The surface tension of the gases was measured each at 25 ̊ C, 30 ̊ C, 35 ̊ C and 40 ̊ C within the varied pressure to establish the significance of temperature. The results showed that increasing pressure at a given temperature reduces surface tension. Also increasing temperature at a given pressure reduces the surface tension. The surface tension obtained at 25 ̊ C and 10 psig is 74. 85 mN/m while that of 40 ̊ C and 110 psig is 59. 55 mN/m for methane bubble. The results obtained for <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>bubble</b> at 25 ̊ C and 10 psig is 73. 09 and 58. 78 mN/m for 40 ̊ C and 110 psig. The diameter of the gas bubbles was also measured {{as a function of}} time at each corresponding temperature. The diameter of the <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>bubble</b> was found to be decreasing with time, and this shows the miscibility behaviour of the CO 2 in water. In the case of CH 4, the diameter was found to remain constant in the same condition of temperature and pressure used in investigating CO 2. The results show that, though both CO 2 and CH 4 are nonpolar molecules, at the same condition of pressure and temperature CO 2 has higher dispersion than methane...|$|R

5000|$|According to the UK's Committee on Climate Change, overvaluing {{companies}} that produce {{fossil fuels and}} greenhouse gases poses {{a serious threat to}} the economy. The committee warned the British government and Bank of England of the risks of the <b>carbon</b> <b>bubble</b> in 2014. The following year, Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, in his lecture to Lloyd's of London, warned that limiting global warming to 2 °C appears to require that the [...] "vast majority" [...] of fossil fuel reserves be [...] "stranded", or [...] "literally unburnable without expensive carbon-capture technology", resulting in [...] "potentially huge" [...] exposure to investors in that sector. He concluded that [...] "the window of opportunity is finite and shrinking" [...] for responding to the threat that climate change poses to financial resilience and longer-term prosperity, which he called the [...] "tragedy of the horizon". That same month, the Prudential Regulation Authority of the Bank of England issued a report discussing the risks and opportunities that climate change presents to the insurance industry.|$|E

He continues to chronicle that transition, and its intersection with the information revolution, on his blog, a column in Recharge magazine, and in articles for media including the Guardian and the Financial Times. He lectures on short courses in business and society at the Universities of Cambridge (UK) and St Gallen (Switzerland). His vision is of a renaissance in civilisation aided or even triggered by renewable energy and its intrinsic social benefits.|$|E
40|$|Liquid fed direct {{methanol}} {{fuel cells}} have drawn increasing attention in recent years. In this paper, a liquid fed direct methanol fuel cell with transparent window {{was designed and}} fabricated for visual investigations of <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>bubbles</b> behaviour and two-phase flow characteristics in anode interdigital flow bed under different operating conditions. The experimental {{results showed that the}} electrochemical reaction and two-phase flow interacted each other. The gas void fraction of carbon dioxide gas and mean size of CO 2 bubbles increased with increase in current density, as well as cell temperature. The two-phase flow patterns in the interdigital flow bed are different from the phenomena in parallel channels flow bed and serpentine channel flow bed. There were gas columns in the inlet channels. The two-phase flow in outlet channels was bubbly flow. Slug flow was not observed in outlet channels of interdigital flow bed. The typical flow pattern in outlet manifold is slug flow. But bubbly flow and slug flow coexisted in the outlet manifold at low temperature. The effect of input flow rate of methanol solution was also studied. High flow rate was helpful for removal of <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>bubbles</b> from flow bed...|$|R
5000|$|Ethanol {{fermentation}} causes bread {{dough to}} rise. Yeast organisms consume sugars in the dough and produce ethanol {{and carbon dioxide}} as waste products. The <b>carbon</b> dioxide forms <b>bubbles</b> in the dough, expanding it a foam. Less than 2% ethanol remains after baking.|$|R

Baking coagulates the gluten, which, along with starch, stabilizes {{the shape of the}} final product. Gluten content has been implicated as a factor in the staling of bread, possibly because it binds water through hydration.|$|R
