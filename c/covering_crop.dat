50|$|In the United States, a {{production}} flexibility contract is a 7-year contract <b>covering</b> <b>crop</b> years 1996-2002, {{authorized by the}} 1996 farm bill (P.L. 104-127) between the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) and farmers, which makes fixed income support payments. Farmers were given production flexibility and diversification options on their contract acres not previously allowed on base acres. Each farm’s total payment was the payment rate times the payment quantity for participating base acres. In exchange for annual fixed payments, the owner or operator agreed {{to comply with the}} applicable conservation plan for the farm, the wetland protection requirements currently in law, and the constraints on growing fruits and vegetables on contract acres. Land enrolled in a contract had to be maintained in an agricultural or related activity. The law stated that not more than $35.6 billion would be paid over the 7-year period, in declining annual amounts from $5.3 billion in FY1996 to $4.0 billion in FY in 2002. The annual payments were allocated among commodities similar to historical deficiency payments, with 53.6% going to feed grains, 26.3% for wheat, 11.6% for upland cotton, and 8.5% for rice. Target prices and deficiency payments, authorized in the 1973 farm bill, were eliminated. The 2002 farm bill (P.L. 101-171, Sec. 1105) replaced this 7-year contract with an annual producer agreement (contract) required for participation in the Direct and Counter-cyclical Program (DCP).|$|E

However, the studies {{on the effects of}} residue management on methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emission from paddy field in southern China are few.

The experiment was established in 2004 in Hunan Province, China. Three winter cropping systems were used: rice–rice–rape (Brassica napus L.) (T 1), rice–rice–potato with straw mulching (Solanum tuberosumL.) (T 2), and rice–rice with winter fallow (CK). A randomized block design was adopted in plots, with three replications. The results showed that T 2 plots had the largest CH 4 emissions during the early and late rice growing season with 12. 506 and 32. 991 g m− 2, respectively. When compared to CK, total N 2 O emissions in the early rice growth period and the emissions of the gas increased by 0. 013 g m− 2 in T 1 and 0. 045 g m− 2 in T 2, respectively. Similar results were obtained in the late rice growth period; the total N 2 O emis-sions increased by 0. 027 g m− 2 in T 1 and 0. 084 g m− 2 in T 2, respectively. The mean value of global warming potentials (GWPs) of CH 4 and N 2 O emissions over 100 years was in the order of T 2 >T 1 >CK, which indicated CK and T 1 was significantly lower than T 2 (P< 0. 05). This suggests that adop-tion of T 1 would be beneficial for greenhouse gas emission mitigation and could be a good option cropping pattern in double rice cropped regions...|$|R

Any malfunction of these pipelines may cause devastating {{effect on the}} environment. Hence, the pipeline operators plan and design pipelines projects with sufficient consideration of environment and social aspects along with the technological alternatives.

Impact assessments (IA) are then carried out to justify the selection and subsequent statutory approval. However, the IAs often suggest alternative sites and/or alternate technology and implementation methodology, resulting in revision of entire technical and financial analysis. This study addresses the above issues by developing an integrated framework for project feasibility analysis with the application of analytic hierarchy process (AHP), a multiple attribute decision-making technique. The model considers technical analysis (TA), socioeconomic IA (SEIA) and environmental IA (EIA) in an integrated framework to select the best project from a few alternative feasible projects. Subsequent financial analysis then justifies the selection. The entire methodology has been explained here through a case application on cross-country petroleum pipeline project in India...|$|E

Thermal images with spatial resolution of 768  ×  576  pixels were captured seven times <b>covering</b> <b>crop</b> growth stages just {{before and after}} anthesis. A tripod perpendicular to the area being imaged was used to ensure constant distance and angle between the camera and crop canopy for during all the measurements. Dry and wet references were used to mimic leaves with fully closed and fully opened stomata, respectively (Jones et al. 2002) and to avoid extreme conditions while capturing images. Emissivity for all the measurements were set at 0.96 (Jones 2004). IRBIS® software (Jenoptic, Germany) was used to analyse thermal images. A total of six areas of interest in each thermal image were outlined manually for analysis. Images in the visible wavelength were referred to exclude noise from ground area. Minimum canopy temperature {{in each of the}} sections in each thermal image was considered to get a value that represents cooling capacity of cultivar. Since the variation among the cultivars for this trait at any given point of time was marginal, we opted to compute area under curve of canopy temperature vs days with reference to anthesis for assessing genetic variation in plant’s capacity to keep the canopy cooler.|$|E
30|$|Few {{comprehensive}} estimates {{have been}} made of the impacts of HR crops on herbicide use. The USDA has not issued a new estimate in well over a decade; the USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) reported an 3.7 million kg (8.2 million pound) decrease in pesticide use in 1998 as a result of GE corn, soybeans, and cotton [7], an estimate that is comparable to the present study’s estimate of a 4.4 million kg (9.6 million pound) reduction [Additional file 1 : Table S 15]. A series of unpublished simulation studies have been carried out by the National Center for Food and Agriculture Policy (NCFAP). In a report <b>covering</b> <b>crop</b> year 2005, NCFAP projected that HR corn, soybean, and cotton reduced total herbicide use by 25.6 million kgs, compared to hectares planted to non-HR varieties [6]. Sankula’s herbicide use estimates are based on observations of mostly university experts regarding “typical” herbicide use rates on farms planting HR versus non-HR varieties. The rates incorporated in Sankula’s estimates often differ from those published for the same year by USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) [8]. NASS reported that an average 1.5 applications of glyphosate were made on HR soybeans in 2005, while Sankula assumes only 1.18 applications. Sankula’s estimate of total herbicide use on RR soybeans in 2005, 1.15 kgs/ha (1.03 pounds/acre), is less than the NASS figure for glyphosate alone, 1.23 kgs/ha (1.1 pounds/acre). If true, Sankula’s data suggests that essentially no other herbicides were applied to RR soybeans in 2005, when in fact the average soybean hectare in 2002 was treated with 1.66 herbicides according to NASS data.|$|E

40|$|In {{this report}} we {{described}} {{the current status}} of GM crops approved worldwide and the likely future developments for the short to medium term, for all relevant crops from all countries. Everywhere the commercialisation of these new GM crops is a regulated activity and different countries have different authorisation procedures. Therefore new GM crops do not get simultaneously approved in all countries. This "asynchronous approval" (AA) of GM crops is of growing concern for its potential economic impact on international trade, especially if crop importing countries operate a "zero tolerance" policy that may result in rejections of imports that contain only traces of not yet authorised GMOs; a similar problem of "low-level presence" (LLP) of unapproved GM material in imports arises when developers of new GM crops did not seek approval for commercialisation in export markets in the first place. In the EU both AA and LLP have already caused trade disruption and economic problems, in particular for the EU feed and livestock sectors. To forecast the future evolution of AA/LLP, expected new GM crops were classified in five categories according to their proximity to market, they were discussed crop-wise, and their possible authorisation by the different trading partners of the EU were considered. The prediction is that while currently there are around 30 commercial GM events cultivated worldwide, by 2015 there will be over 120. Therefore, if problems of AA/LLP have occurred with 30 events in the market, these are likely to intensify when moving from 30 to 120 available events. Moreover, individual GM events can easily be combined ("stacked") by conventional cross-breeding. Given the growing pipeline of individual events, it is evident that in countries where stacked GM crops are required to go through the regulatory system as a new GM crop, this will create an increasingly large number of new "approvable" GMOs. Yet, apart from AA, also the issue of LLP of is bound to increase with more of the new GM crops being developed by national technology providers in Asia for their domestic agricultural markets, as these developers may not submit all of their GM crops for approval in potential export markets. Overall it is expected that next to the current major GM crops (soybeans, maize, rapeseed and cotton) and some minor ones, in the medium term also GM potatoes and GM rice will be commercialised. Apart from the current main traits (insect resistance, herbicide tolerance or a combination of both), new commercial traits <b>covering</b> <b>crop</b> composition and abiotic stress tolerance will become available. For stakeholders in the global food and feed chain the main problem of AA/LLP is the economic risk of rejections of shipments at the EU border. Part of this problem consists of the "destination risk", i. e. the official testing for unauthorised GM material in the port of destination only ¿ when a cancellation of the shipment is impossible and when its re-direction is costly. Also, given the bulk handling of grains in international trade, compliance with a zero tolerance threshold for LLP is impossible. Therefore exporters may choose to sell their grain to "preferred buyers" who are known to create little problems. Moreover, the price of grain is determined based on quality and quantity with a strong relationship between price, specifications and risk ¿ the latter of which is increased if there is uncertainty whether compliance with LLP regulations is possible. Or, if the risk cannot be managed, there will be no trade at all. Higher prices and potential supply bottlenecks also mean that EU businesses that are dependent on cheap imports of agricultural commodities, like livestock farming, may have to relocate abroad. JRC.

Control of the disease in organic strawberry crops depends merely on prevention. Botrytis infection risk depends on humidity and temperature. Under optimal temperature conditions leaf wetness period necessary for infection of strawberry flowers decreases (Bulger et al., 1997). Prevention or shortening of the leaf wetness period might help to reduce infection risk of strawberries. Cv. Elsanta proved less susceptible to B. cinerea than cv. Darselect, thus choosing an appropriate cultivar is a helpful means to control grey mould. Covering the crop with polythene tunnels effectively reduced the infection risk of B. cinerea on strawberry flowers.
