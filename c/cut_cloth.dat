His education was augmented by citizens who would come to Selby's shop to read to the tailors as they worked. Even before he became an apprentice, Johnson came to listen. The readings caused a lifelong love of learning, and one of his biographers, Annette Gordon-Reed, suggests that Johnson, later a gifted public speaker, learned the art as he threaded needles and <b>cut</b> <b>cloth.</b>|$|E

Raffles had cutting rooms in the upper section of Brunswick Mill where the pattern <b>cut</b> <b>cloth</b> was fed by carousel and conveyor to the sewing rooms in the lower section of the adjacent building.

50|$|Human uses of {{serration}} have copied, {{and gone}} beyond, {{those found in}} nature. For example, the teeth on a saw or other serrated blade serves a similar cutting or scraping purpose as the serration of an animal tooth. Tailors use pinking shears to <b>cut</b> <b>cloth</b> with a serrated edge, which, somewhat counterintuitively, reduces fraying by reducing {{the average length of}} a thread that may be pulled from the edge. A type of serration is also found in airframe shapes used in certain stealth aircraft, which use the jaggedness of the serrated edge to deflect radar signals from seams and edges where a straight, non-serrated edge would reflect radar signals back to the source. Screw threads show serration in profile, although they are usually shown in abbreviated or symbolic fashion on mechanical drawings to save time and ink. Brogue shoes are made with serrated edges on the leather pieces, for no known purpose at all other than style. The step clamp and step block assembly in metalworking adopt serration for the purpose of applying clamping pressure from an adjustable position.|$|E

40|$|This {{reversible}} garment, the grow-shrink-and-turncoat, {{is constructed}} in modules which {{allow it to}} be extended or tightened depending on the wearer. Later, it can be disassembled and then reassembled to form a new garment. The laser-cut holes allow for layers of cloth to be added or removed. The design was developed in part from a brainstorming activity with first and second year QUT students – their ideas included a garment which can be taken apart, a garment to fit many people, and most intriguingly, a garment that can open and ‘grow’ like a flower, swelling up in cold weather to warm the body. Taking these ideas, I developed a garment which can be disassembled, with layers added or subtracted by the wearer according to aesthetics and / or comfort. The shell is constructed from six squares of laser <b>cut</b> <b>cloth,</b> draped together with six smaller laser-cut rectangles, held in place with removable stitching. Additional squares and rectangles of cloth can be added / subtracted with ties knotted through the laser-cut holes. The laser cutting becomes a patterning device as well as integral to the construction of the garment. Conceptually, the garment is grounded in the notion of fabric as a precious resource – the pieces are designed to be disassembled at end-of-life, and then reconfigured into a fresh design...|$|E
40|$|The {{history of}} medieval hosen {{is not a}} view of a {{continuously}} improved product. It involves several nations, and several centuries, and like all Medieval innovation, its course is slow and uneven, guided more by habit and tradition than by thought. An apprentice to a tailor was trained by rote; a medieval tailor of any sort, by what examples we can find in literature and artwork, would draft an item for a customer freehand on the cloth, or perhaps rely {{on a series of}} master templates. Modern pattern sizes, in any notation, were an unknown concept in so far as we can tell. From this remote vantage point, {{take a look at the}} complexity of snugly fitting the garment to the human body (anywhere on the body!), and you can begin to appreciate the difficulty in attempting broad innovations in style. A tailor who attempted a radical change in pattern would have to teach himself by rote how to recreate that new pattern, or possibly recreate his entire stock of master templates. This was not an age when people could afford to scrap or replace yards of specially <b>cut</b> <b>cloth</b> on a whim. Seemingly every time the medievals were faced with the decision of spending more labor or more material, they opted for the labor-intensive solutions: clearly, labor was cheaper than material. By necessity, therefore, any surviving garments were either likely to be widely used, or at worst, represent repairs to a standard garment. An exception to this rule might be fantastical show garments, such as parade armo...|$|E

50|$|During {{the later}} {{part of the}} 19th century, working {{conditions}} in the U.S. textile industry deteriorated. Immigrant textile workers coming from Yorkshire and Lancashire to New England found the mills poorly run, with the managers cheating on measurements of <b>cuts</b> of <b>cloth</b> and time worked, and arbitrarily cutting wages without warning. These workers were often skilled, accustomed to being well-treated in their home country, and accustomed to taking industrial action if they were not. There were a series of strikes from the 1870s onward.|$|R
50|$|Rank {{insignia}} {{were originally}} <b>cut</b> from <b>cloth</b> or embroidered onto cloth patches. Bronze-metal officer's rank insignia worn {{on a red}} cloth backing were introduced for the army in 1949. Enlisted stripes for all arms were originally individual white half-chevrons with space between them. In an economy move, senior NCOs were distinguished by using the same bronze insignia (an oak-leaf or oak-leaf-in-a-wreath) as senior officers pinned to their sleeve insignia. In 1951 the Navy adopted golden-yellow half-chevrons and the Air Force adopted blue half chevrons.|$|R
