40|$|Today, <b>coal</b> <b>refuse</b> as {{industrial}} {{solid waste}} stockpiled {{on the ground}} {{is one of the greatest}} threats to the environment. One of the practical solutions to utilize this huge amount of solid waste is to activate the <b>coal</b> <b>refuse</b> and utilize it as substitution for portion of ordinary Portland cement. The key purpose of activation is to enhance the pozzolanic property of the <b>coal</b> <b>refuse.</b> Many scientists and engineers found that thermal activation is a practical approach on increasing pozzolanic property. For thermal activation, temperature and time are two important parameters which significantly determine the activation effect. In this paper, a systematic research has been conducted to seek for anoptimal solution for enhancing pozzolanic reactivity of the relatively inert solid waste-coal refuse in order to improve the utilization efficiency and economy benefit forconstruction and building materials. The mechanical property analysis shows that coal refusethat activated at 700 °C to 800 °C with 1 hour to 1. 5 hours has much higher reactivity when compared with <b>coal</b> <b>refuse</b> activated at 500 °C to 600 °C with 1 hour to 1. 5 hours.
