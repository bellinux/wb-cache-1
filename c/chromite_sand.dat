50|$|<b>Chromite</b> <b>sand</b> {{is a solid}} {{solution}} of spinels. Its advantages are a low percentage of silica, a very high fusion point (1850 C), and a very high thermal conductivity. Its disadvantage is its costliness, therefore it's only used with expensive alloy steel casting and to make cores.|$|E
40|$|Silica sand for foundry use is {{inexpensive}} to purchase, readily transported {{and widely}} available. As a result, it is universally used. However, three factors {{are becoming increasingly}} significant as more environmental regulations are promulgated. First, the disposal of waste foundry sand has become an excessively burdensome cost. Second, the phase changes which occur in the silica structure on heating and cooling cause thermal breakdown of the sand into smaller unusable fractions. Third, silica is a relatively weak mineral. Alternatives to silica sand which can withstand the rigors of repetitive reuse must be seriously evaluated {{as a way to}} control production costs of the domestic metal casting industry. <b>Chromite</b> <b>sands,</b> olivine sands and carbon sands have each been successfully used to solve operating problems and thus have developed their specific niches in the foundry materials inventory. However, there are several other materials that are candidates for replacing silica sand, such as fused alumina, sintered bauxite and sintered oil well proppants. These media, and others that are generically similar, are manufactured for specific purposes. Compositions and shapes could be readily tailored for used in a metal casting environment of total recycling and materials conservation. This study examines materials that are readily available as alternatives to silica sand from a functionality perspective and a cost perspective. Some of the alternative materials are natural and others are synthetic and thus referring to them as ``sands`` has the potential to cause confusion; the generic term ``granular medium`` is used in this study to mean any material that could functionally substitute for silica sand in the foundry process...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of basic research on the influence of the properties of sand grains on electrical properties of water glass moulding sands. It shows electrical properties of the main component – sand grains, crucial to the kinetics of moulding sands heating, such as permittivity εr and loss factor tgδ. Measurements were carried out {{with the use of the}} perturbation method for silica, <b>chromite</b> and olivine <b>sands</b> of different mineral, chemical composition and particle size distribution, as well as for moulding sands with water glass grade 145. Analysis of the results of measurements of electrical properties shows that all moulding sands are characterized by a similar permittivity εr and loss factor tgδ. It was found that the electrical properties and the quantity and quality of other components may have a decisive influence on the effectiveness and efficiency of the microwave heating of moulding sands with sand grains. In determining the ability to efficiently absorb the microwave radiation for mixtures which moulding sands are, the impact of all components influencing their individual technological parameters should be taken into account...|$|R

40|$|In the paper, a {{research}} on effects of baking temperature on <b>chromite</b> <b>sand</b> base of moulding sands bonded with sodium silicate is presented. Pure <b>chromite</b> <b>sand</b> and its chromite-based moulding sand prepared {{with use of}} sodium silicate were subjected to heating within 100 to 1200 °C. After cooling-down, changes of base grains under thermal action were determined. Chromite moulding sand was prepared with use of 0. 5 wt% of domestic made, unmodified sodium silicate (water-glass) grade 145. After baking at elevated temperatures, creation of rough layer was observed on grain surfaces, of both pure <b>chromite</b> <b>sand</b> and that used as base of a moulding sand. Changes of sand grains were evaluated by scanning microscopy and EDS analyses. It was found that changes on grain surfaces are of laminar nature. The observed layer is composed of iron oxide (II) {{that is one of}} main structural components of <b>chromite</b> <b>sand.</b> In order to identify changes in internal structure of <b>chromite</b> <b>sand</b> grains, polished sections were prepared of moulding sand hardened with microwaves and baked at elevated temperatures. Microscopic observations revealed changes in grains structure in form of characteristically crystallised acicular particles with limited magnesium content, intersecting at various angles. EDS analysis showed that these particles are composed mostly of chromium oxide (III) and iron oxide (II). The temperature above that the a. m. changes are observed in both chromite-based moulding sand and in pure <b>chromite</b> <b>sand.</b> The observed phenomena were linked with hardness values and mass of this sand...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the effects of number of washings, curing time and heat treatment on the breaking strength of no-bake chromite sand-furan resin cores. The Hevi <b>chromite</b> <b>sand</b> produced by a single stage washing of <b>chromite</b> <b>sand</b> was found to exhibit lower breaking strength in service. Forty five samples of no-bake <b>chromite</b> <b>sand</b> mixes were prepared with furan resin at room temperature and 39 % humidity from <b>chromite</b> <b>sand</b> washed in single and two stages and cured at 2, 4 and 24 hours. Eighteen of the samples washed in single and two stages were tested for breaking strength without heat treatment, while the 27 obtained from single stage washing sand mix were heated to 900 oC and held at 12, 14 and 16 minutes before cooling. Re-washing gave an appreciable increase in breaking strength only for samples cured for 24 hours. The results obtained showed that highest breaking strength occurred in heat treated and cured samples with the highest occurring at curing period of 24 hours and 900 oC with holding time of 16 minutes. For re-washed samples held in room atmosphere, there was a decrease in breaking strength compared to the single stage washed samples. The implication of this work is that Hevi <b>chromite</b> <b>sand</b> has better breaking strength when heat treated at 900 °C and held in the temperature for 16 minutes. Evidently, the air cured samples may have been affected by the air humidity...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{determination}} of the SiO 2 content in a <b>chromite</b> <b>sand</b> and in a reclaimer <b>chromite</b> <b>sand</b> by the infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and by the chemical method, are presented in the paper. Due to the interference of components of the investigated samples with theanalytical band characteristic for silica (798 and 779 cm- 1), the band at a wave number of 1080 cm- 1 was accepted as the analytical band inexaminations. The regression analysis exhibited the satisfactory compatibility of the results obtained by the FTIR method and by thechemical one, especially at the higher SiO 2 content...|$|E
40|$|Using the {{available}} analytical methods, including {{the determination of}} chemical composition using wavelength-dispersive X-ray fluorescent spectroscopy technique and phase composition determined using X-ray diffraction, microstructural observations in a highresolution scanning microscope equipped with an X-ray microanalysis system as well as determination of characteristic softening and sintering temperatures using high-temperature microscope, the properties of particular chromite sands were defined. For the study has been typed reference sand with chemical properties, physical and thermal, treated as standard, and the sands of the regeneration process and the grinding process. Using these kinds of sand in foundries resulted in the occurrence of {{the phenomenon of the}} molding mass sintering. Impurities were identified and causes of sintering of a moulding sand based on <b>chromite</b> <b>sand</b> were characterized. Next, research methods enabling a quick evaluation of <b>chromite</b> <b>sand</b> suitability for use in the preparation of moulding sands were selected...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a {{research on the}} relation between thermal preparation of <b>chromite</b> <b>sand</b> base of moulding sands containing sodium silicate, hardened with selected physical and chemical methods, {{and structure of the}} created bonding bridges. Test specimens were prepared of <b>chromite</b> <b>sand</b> - fresh or baked at 950 °C for 10 or 24 hours - mixed with 0. 5 wt. % of the selected non-modified inorganic binder and, after forming, were hardened with CO 2 or liquid esters, dried traditionally or heated with microwaves at 2. 45 GHz. It was shown on the grounds of SEM observations that the time of baking the base sand and the hardening method significantly affect structure of the bonding bridges and are correlated with mechanical properties of the moulding sands. It was found that hardening chromite-based moulding mixtures with physical methods is much more favourable than hardening with chemical methods, guaranteeing also more than ten times higher mechanical properties...|$|E
40|$|The project {{elaborated}} {{in frame}} of engineering studies is submitting {{the study of}} thermal properties of holding mixtures using different types of sand. Were tested a total of 5 sands: zirkon, ŠH 22, chromite, olivine and dunite. Molding compounds were tested for thermal capacity, thermal conductivity and heat accumulation. The highest heat capacity was achieved in dunite sand.

40|$|Cooling rate is a {{key factor}} that can {{drastically}} affect the phase transformation and thermal stress of duplex stainless steels. Therefore, in this research, different sand moulds were used to {{explore the influence of}} cooling rate on the solidification of the 2304 duplex stainless steel (DSS). The macro and micro structures of the 2304 DSS were investigated. Small equiaxed grains are obtained in <b>chromite</b> <b>sand</b> mould sample with a lower pouring temperature and a higher cooling rate, whereas coarse columnar and equiaxed grains are found in silica sand and refractory powder mould samples. The size of austenite phase is significantly increased with decreasing cooling rate, while the ferrite phase content ranging from 51. 6 % to 53. 9 % does not change obviously. In addition, the linear contraction of the 2304 DSS decreases from 2. 34 % to 1. 09 % when the mean cooling rate above 1, 173 K increases from 0. 99 K·s- 1 to 3. 66 K·s- 1...|$|E
40|$|In this work, Al- 7. 5 Si- 4 Cu alloy melt {{modified}} by Al- 10 Sr, RE and Al- 5 Ti-B master alloys was poured into multi-step moulds made from three moulding sands, including quartz, alumina and chromite, to investigate comparatively {{the effects of}} different cooling rates of the casting mould on the alloy's microstructures and mechanical properties. The results show that {{with an increase in}} wall thickness, the cooling rate decreases, the dendrite arm spacing (DAS) increases significantly and the mechanical properties decrease steadily. The elongation is more sensitive to the cooling rate than the tensile strength. No obvious trend of the effect of wall thickness on hardness of the alloy was found. When the cooling rate is at its greatest, the microstructures and mechanical properties are the best when using <b>chromite</b> <b>sand.</b> The improvement of the properties is mainly attributed to the decrease of the DAS, the grain refinement and the metamorphic effect. Each of the three has a strong impact on the microstructures. Furthermore, a series of fitting models was established based on the data of the DAS to predict the mechanical properties of the multivariate sand-cast Al- 7. 5 Si- 4 Cu alloy...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} an original method of measuring the actual chromite {{content in the}} circulating moulding sand of foundry. This type of material is applied for production of moulds. This {{is the case of}} foundry which most frequently perform heavy casting in which for the construction of chemical hardening mould is used, both the quartz sand and <b>chromite</b> <b>sand.</b> After the dry reclamation of used moulding sand, both types of sands are mixed in various ratios resulting that in reclaimed sand silos, the layers of varying content of chromite in mixture are observed. For chromite recuperation from the circulating moulding sand there are applied the appropriate installations equipped with separate elements generating locally strong magnetic field. The knowledge of the current ratio of chromite and quartz sand allows to optimize the settings of installation and control of the separation efficiency. The arduous and time-consuming method of determining the content of chromite using bromoform liquid requires operational powers and precautions during using this toxic liquid. It was developed and tested the new, uncomplicated gravimetric laboratory method using powerful permanent magnets (neodymium). The method is used in the production conditions of casting for current inspection of chromite quantity in used sand in reclamation plant...|$|E
