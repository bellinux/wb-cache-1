5|$|The 2009 McDonald's NBA All-Star Celebrity Game {{was played}} on Friday, February 13 at the Phoenix Convention Center. A total of 16 celebrities {{took part in}} the game, {{including}} several former NBA players. Basketball Hall of Famers Magic Johnson and Julius Erving, who combined for 23 NBA All-Star appearances, served as coaches for the celebrity teams. NBA legends, Dominique Wilkins and <b>Clyde</b> <b>Drexler,</b> were joined by former players, Dan Majerle and Rick Fox, in the celebrity team roster. WNBA stars Lisa Leslie and Kara Lawson also participated in the game along with four Harlem Globetrotters players.|$|E
5|$|Despite this, the Trail Blazers had a 13-game {{winning streak}} {{that began in}} early December, {{resulting}} in a 13–2 record, an NBA best {{for the month of}} December. Nate McMillan won NBA Coach of the Month honors, and Roy garnered NBA Western Conference Player of the Week honors in back-to-back weeks (the first Trail Blazer to accomplish the feat since <b>Clyde</b> <b>Drexler</b> in the 1990–91 season). Western Conference head coaches selected Roy to the 2008 NBA All-Star Game, the first All-Star for the Blazers since Rasheed Wallace in 2001. The Blazers finished the season 41–41, their best record since the 2003–04 season. Following the season, the Blazers became the only NBA team for the Pacific Northwest, as the Seattle SuperSonics moved to Oklahoma City.|$|E
5|$|The 1984 draft {{class is}} {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} best in NBA history as it produced five Hall of Famers and seven All-Stars. However, it was also marked by the Blazers' selection of Sam Bowie, considered one of the biggest draft busts in NBA history. It is believed that the Blazers picked Bowie over Michael Jordan because they already had an All Star shooting guard in Jim Paxson and a young shooting guard in <b>Clyde</b> <b>Drexler,</b> whom they drafted in the 1983 draft. Although Drexler went on to have a successful career, Bowie's career was cut short by injuries; he had missed two of the past three seasons in his college career as well. Despite having a 10-year career in the NBA and averaging 10.9points and 7.5rebounds per game, Bowie's career was interrupted by five leg surgeries, which limited him to 139games in 5years with the Blazers.|$|E
50|$|After three years, Carter {{returned}} to his hometown and joined the sports staff of the Houston Chronicle, originally as the beat writer for Southwest Conference athletics. In 1983, Carter {{was the first to}} report <b>Clyde</b> <b>Drexler's</b> decision to leave the University of Houston and enter the National Basketball Association draft as a junior. Drexler, later to become an NBA Hall of Famer, had arranged for CBS Sports to film his draft declaration in his living room and then break the story. But a member of the film crew, having mistaken Carter for one of Drexler's neighbors, allowed him to stand in the hallway during the filming. Carter grabbed a phone in the kitchen. His report was on the national wires within minutes.|$|R
50|$|They met {{each other}} {{in the first round of}} the 1998 NBA Playoffs. The Jazz {{finished}} tied with the best record with Chicago at 62-20, having swept the regular-season series against the Bulls, guaranteeing home court advantage throughout the entire playoffs. However, the eighth-seeded Houston Rockets, who finished with a record of 41-41 due to numerous injuries, nearly gave the Jazz a scare when the Rockets, led by Drexler's 22 points, won the first game in the Delta Center 103-90. After the Jazz won Game 2 105-90, the Rockets won a grinding Game 3 89-85, led by a team-high 28 points and 12 rebounds from Olajuwon. The Utah Jazz were now one loss away from becoming only the second first-seeded team to lose to an eighth seed. The Rockets looked poised to win the fourth game, but Charles Barkley received an elbow to his forearm, tearing a triceps muscle and ending his season. The Jazz won the last two games of the series over the shorthanded Rockets, ending the retiring <b>Clyde</b> <b>Drexler's</b> career.|$|R

Detroit played a brash and dominating brand of basketball through the playoffs that led to their nickname [...] "". First they defeated Boston, which had been suffering persistent injuries. Michael Jordan and the up-and-coming Chicago Bulls fell next in the Conference Finals, setting up an NBA Finals rematch with the Lakers. This time the Pistons were dominating, sweeping the Lakers in 4 games to win their first of back-to-back championships. The following year, Thomas was voted NBA Finals Most Valuable Player of the 1990 NBA Finals after averaging 27.6 points per game, 7.0 assists per game, and 5.2 rebounds per game in Detroit's victory over <b>Clyde</b> <b>Drexler's</b> Portland Trail Blazers. The Pistons continued to play well between 1991 and 1993 but found their road back to the NBA Finals blocked by the emerging Chicago Bulls dynasty. An aging and ailing Thomas decided to end his career following the 1994 season, but a torn Achilles' tendon in April forced him off the court for good a month early.|$|R
5|$|The first {{championship}} came at {{the expense}} of the Los Angeles Lakers, which also saw the last appearance in the Finals for Magic Johnson. Billed as a showdown between the aging Johnson and the upstart Jordan, the Lakers won the first game, 93–91. For the rest of the series, Pippen guarded Johnson, allowing Jordan to attain a free scoring role to lead Chicago to ultimately taking the next four games. The Bulls returned to the Finals in the next year, pitted against <b>Clyde</b> <b>Drexler</b> and the Portland Trail Blazers. Throughout the 1991–1992 season, Jordan and Drexler led their teams to the best records in their respective conferences, leading to several comparisons between the two players in anticipation of a postseason match-up. Chicago defeated the Trail Blazers in Game 1 by 33 points, a game notable for Jordan breaking the record for the most three-pointer in a first half, with six. Game 2 went into overtime, with the Trail Blazers outscoring the Bulls 18–7 in the final period to run away with the win. Game 3 and 4 were split between Chicago and Portland, respectively, but the Bulls took the final two games, clinching their second championship.|$|E
5|$|On December 18, Roy {{scored a}} career-high 52 points against the Phoenix Suns. He made 14 of 27 {{shots from the}} field, 19 of 21 from the free-throw line, and 5 of 7 from the three-point line. He also added six assists, five rebounds and a blocked shot, all without a turnover. On January 24, Roy tied a Blazers {{franchise}} record with 10 steals against the Washington Wizards. On February 8 with the Blazers trailing by 1 against the Knicks, Roy made a layup at the buzzer to win it 109–108. As of February 16, 2009, Roy has had 24 shots which tied or won the games with 35 seconds or less. Roy was again selected as a reserve in the 2009 NBA All-Star Game, where he scored 14 points in 7-for-8 shooting, grabbed 5 boards, and dished out 5 assists in a game-high 31 minutes of action. On April 13, Roy was named Western Conference Player of the Week, the fourth time he has won the award. Roy and <b>Clyde</b> <b>Drexler</b> are the only Portland Trail Blazers to win the award four times. Roy finished 9th in MVP voting for the 2008–09 season, garnering one 4th-place vote and four 5th-place votes {{for a total of}} 7 points. Roy was named to the All-NBA Second Team on May 13, and was the first Blazer to make an All-NBA team since the 1991–92 season.|$|E

5000|$|The {{question}} that frequently surrounds Sabonis' NBA career revolves around {{how good he}} could have been had he played in the NBA during his prime. Sabonis was nearly 31 when he joined the Blazers, by which time he had already won multiple gold medals, suffered through numerous injuries and had lost much of his mobility and athleticism. In Bill Simmons' [...] "Book of Basketball", Arvydas Sabonis the international player is idealized while Arvydas Sabonis the Blazer is described as [...] "lumbering up and down the court in what looked to be concrete Nikes" [...] and ranking [...] "just behind Artis Gilmore on the Moving Like a Mummy Scale." [...] In ESPN's David Thorpe's view, Sabonis would be the best passing big man in NBA history and possibly top 4 center overall, had he played his entire career there. In <b>Clyde</b> <b>Drexler's</b> view, if Sabonis had been able to spend his prime in Portland next to the plethora of other Trail Blazers' All Stars (Drexler, Terry Porter, Buck Williams and Cliff Robinson), the Trail Blazers would [...] "have had four, five or six titles. Guaranteed. He was that good. He could pass, shoot three pointers, had a great post game, and dominated the paint." ...|$|R
5000|$|Lillard {{amassed a}} team-record 695 {{points in the}} Blazers' first 25 games of the season, eclipsing <b>Clyde</b> <b>Drexler's</b> {{previous}} mark of 681 in 1988. He went on to miss five games between December 26 and January 4 after spraining his left ankle against San Antonio on December 23. On January 28 against Golden State, Lillard reached 8,000 career points, becoming the 11th Blazer to hit the mark and joined Michael Jordan and LeBron James as the only three players to reach 8,000 points and 2,000 assists in their first five seasons. On March 19, Lillard scored a season-high 49 points, tied a career high with nine three-pointers, and carried the Trail Blazers past the Miami Heat, 115-104. On April 3, 2017, he was named Western Conference Player of the Month for games played in March. Behind Lillard, the Trail Blazers went an NBA-best 13-3 in March to surge into eighth place in the Western Conference. Lillard ranked third in the NBA in scoring (29.1 ppg) and tied for fourth in three-pointers made (55) to go with 6.0 assists, 4.4 rebounds and 1.44 steals in 16 games. Five days later, Lillard scored a franchise-record 59 points and matched his career high with nine three-pointers to lead the Trail Blazers to a 101-86 win over the Jazz. It was Lillard's 27th {{game of the season}} with 30 or more points, a franchise high. He also became the fifth Blazer to score 2,000-plus points in a season. After being 10 games under [...]500 at the All-Star Break, Lillard helped the Trail Blazers to an 18-8 late-season surge to earned them the No. 8 seed in the Western Conference with a 41-41 record. They faced the Golden State Warriors for the second straight year in the playoffs, this time in the first round. Portland went on to lose the series in a clean sweep despite Lillard's 34-point effort in Game 4. For the series, Lillard averaged 27.8 points, 4.5 rebounds, 3.3 assists and 1.3 steals per game while shooting 43% from the field, 28% from behind the arc, and 96% from the free throw line. On May 2, 2017, he was named the recipient of the Magic Johnson Award for the 2016-17 season, which honors the player who best combines excellence on the basketball court with cooperation and dignity in dealing with the media and the public.|$|R

25|$|Prior to the 1996–97 season, the Timberwolves made a draft-day {{trade for}} point guard Stephon Marbury of the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. During the season, Garnett posted {{improving}} averages of 17.0 points, 8.0 rebounds, 3.1 assists, 2.1 blocks and 1.7 steals. He also had two games where he registered eight blocks. With a 40–42 record, the Timberwolves made their first playoff appearance in franchise history, Garnett and Gugliotta made their first All-Star appearances, and Marbury {{established himself as}} a valuable young lead guard. However, the Houston Rockets, led by Hakeem Olajuwon, <b>Clyde</b> <b>Drexler,</b> and Charles Barkley, proved to be too much as the Timberwolves were swept 3–0 {{in the first round of}} the 1997 NBA Playoffs.|$|E
25|$|The 1994–95 NBA {{season was}} the Rockets' 28th {{season in the}} National Basketball Association, and 24th season in Houston.

However, with {{increased}} competition in the West, management felt a change was needed to win another title. On February 14, the Rockets traded Otis Thorpe to the Portland Trail Blazers for All-Star guard <b>Clyde</b> <b>Drexler,</b> a former teammate of Hakeem Olajuwon at the University of Houston. However, after the trade, the Rockets struggled {{in the second half of}} the season posting a record of 17–18 on their way to finishing third in the Midwest Division with a 47–35 record. Olajuwon was selected for the 1995 NBA All-Star Game.|$|E
25|$|Malone {{returned}} from a gold medal winning-effort at the 1996 Summer Olympics leading the Jazz to two consecutive NBA Finals appearances. During the 1996–97 season, Malone put up a resurgent 27.4 points per game while leading the Jazz to a 64–18 record, the most regular season wins in team history. Malone won his first NBA Most Valuable Player award, and the Jazz were the top team in the Western Conference and the playoff champions in that conference. After sweeping the Los Angeles Clippers and defeating the Los Angeles Lakers, the Jazz took on the Houston Rockets, led by the aging trio of Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley, and <b>Clyde</b> <b>Drexler.</b> The Jazz beat them in six games (the last victory coming on a last-second shot by Stockton). Malone finally reached the NBA Finals in 1997, where they played the Jordan-led Chicago Bulls. In a matchup of the two previous MVPs, the Bulls took {{the first two games}} at the United Center. Malone struggled from the field, going 6 of 20 for 20 points in Game 2. However the Jazz won the next two games at the Delta Center behind Malone's 37 points in Game 3 and 23 in Game 4, including a game-winning fastbreak lay-up off a spectacular assist by Stockton in the last minute. The Bulls took the next two games and the series, with Malone struggling from the foul line in Game 6.|$|E
25|$|Šarūnas {{started going}} to school in Jonas Jablonskis Middle School in 1982 and {{attended}} it till 1987. He {{had to take the}} bus to go to school even though the thermometer outside read minus twenty and he knew {{that the most important thing}} for his parents was that he spent as little time as possible with the toughest people of Partizanai Street. From 1987 to 1993, he was studying at Kaunas 4th Middle School. His first trip destination was Moscow, which he visited before the tournament. Jasikevičius's greatest youth memory in the city was the opening of the first McDonald's in Russia. He remembers that his classmates were listening with their mouths gaping when he was narrating about the French fries, bread rolls with minced beef and fizzy drinks. One of his childhood passions was history, especially about the Native Americans, as well as books about basketball as he was capable of reading a book of more than four hundred pages on basketball in two days. He was also curious about politics, especially when Perestroika began, because of which he was able to travel to Berlin with his father and brother, and was amazed by the visit to the Checkpoint Charlie Museum. His childhood favorite Lithuanian player was Arvydas Sabonis, which he admired more than other Lithuanian superstars, such as Rimas Kurtinaitis and Valdemaras Chomičius, due to his passing. However, his idol was Dražen Petrović, and he wished to be as good as him, watching matches of him over and over again, dozens of times, for hours and hours, and later started imitating him in workouts. After one of his trips, his dad came back with a videocassette recorder, using which he was able to record an NBA All-Star Game with Michael Jordan, <b>Clyde</b> <b>Drexler,</b> Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, David Robinson, and later to watch it for couple of years, more than hundred times. Jasikevičius also started to record games of Žalgiris and Petrović every time he was able to. Thanks to the video recorder, he discovered the existence of a no-look pass of Magic Johnson. For him, he was the NBA, not Michael Jordan. His unselfishness, imagination and the way he dribbled, passed between his opponent's legs bewitched Jasikevičius. Consequently, his favorite element of basketball quickly became assisting his teammates, and he was trying to do it like Petrović or Johnson.|$|E

He {{and his teammates}} (including <b>Clyde</b> <b>Drexler)</b> formed what was dubbed [...] "Phi Slama Jama", the first slam-dunking [...] "fraternity", so named because of its above-the-rim prowess. In his sophomore and junior years he helped the Cougars advance to consecutive NCAA championship games, where they lost to North Carolina State on a last second tip-in in 1983 and a Patrick Ewing-led Georgetown team in 1984. Olajuwon won the 1983 NCAA Tournament Player of the Year award, even though he played for the losing team in the final game. He is, to date, the last player from a losing side to be granted this honor. Drexler departed for the NBA in 1983, leaving Olajuwon the lone star on the team.|$|E

500|$|In the 1983 draft, {{the team}} {{selected}} University of Houston guard–forward <b>Clyde</b> <b>Drexler</b> with the 14th pick; [...] "Clyde the Glide" [...] {{would become the}} face of the franchise for over a decade, and the team's second-most decorated player (after Walton). In the next year's draft, the Trail Blazers landed the No. 2 pick in the NBA draft. After the Houston Rockets selected Drexler's college teammate Akeem Olajuwon at No. 1, the Trail Blazers selected Kentucky center Sam Bowie. Drafting third, the Chicago Bulls selected Michael Jordan. The selection of the injury-plagued Bowie over Jordan has been criticized as one of the worst draft picks in the history of American professional sports. That summer, the Blazers also made a controversial trade, sending Lever, Cooper, and Natt to the Denver Nuggets for high-scoring forward Kiki Vandeweghe. In the 1985 draft, the Blazers selected point guard Terry Porter with the last pick of the first round. Porter would go on {{to become one of the}} top point guards in the league, and the Blazers' all-time leader in assists.|$|E
500|$|In 1984, the Rockets drafted center Hakeem Olajuwon, {{who would}} be paired with [...] Ralph Sampson, forming one of the tallest front courts in the NBA.

The Rockets continued to reach the playoffs throughout the 1980s, but failed to advance past the first round for several years following a second-round defeat to the Seattle SuperSonics in 1987. Rudy Tomjanovich took over as head coach midway through the 1991–92 season, ushering in the most successful period in franchise history.

When Houston swept the series in four straight games, they became the first team in NBA history to win the championship as a sixth seed, and the first to beat four 50-win teams in a single postseason en route to the championship. Olajuwon was again the Finals MVP, only the second player after Michael Jordan to win the award two years in a row.

After Oakley committed a flagrant foul on Barkley, Barkley responded by shoving Oakley. In his first game with the Houston Rockets, Charles Barkley had a career-high 33 rebounds. He continued to battle injuries throughout the season and played only 53 games, missing fourteen because of a laceration and bruise on his left pelvis, eleven because of a sprained right ankle, and four due to suspensions. He became the team's second leading scorer, averaging 19.2 points on [...]484 shooting; {{the first time since}} his rookie year that he averaged below 20 points per game. With Olajuwon taking most of the shots, Barkley focused primarily on rebounding, averaging 13.5 per game, the second best in his career. The Rockets ended the regular season with a 57–25 record and advanced to the Western Conference Finals, where they were defeated in six games by the Utah Jazz. Barkley averaged 17.9 points and 12.0 rebounds per game in another postseason loss.|$|E
500|$|Jordan and the Bulls {{continued}} their {{dominance in the}} 1991–92 season, establishing a 67–15 record, topping their franchise record from 1990–91.

After winning a physical 7-game series over the New York Knicks {{in the second round}} of the playoffs and finishing off the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Conference Finals in 6 games, the Bulls met <b>Clyde</b> <b>Drexler</b> and the Portland Trail Blazers in the Finals. The media, hoping to recreate a Magic–Bird rivalry, highlighted the similarities between [...] "Air" [...] Jordan and Clyde [...] "The Glide" [...] during the pre-Finals hype. In the first game, Jordan scored a Finals-record 35 points in the first half, including a record-setting six three-point field goals. After the sixth three-pointer, he jogged down the court shrugging as he looked courtside. Marv Albert, who broadcast the game, later stated that it was as if Jordan was saying, [...] "I can't believe I'm doing this." [...] The Bulls went on to win Game 1, and defeat the Blazers in six games. Jordan was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row and finished the series averaging 35.8 ppg, 4.8 rpg, and 6.5 apg, while shooting 53% from the floor.|$|E
500|$|Despite a {{slow start}} by the team, and Olajuwon missing eight games {{toward the end of}} the season with anemia, the Rockets {{repeated}} as champions in 1995.

500|$|As a {{freshman}} in coach Dean Smith's team-oriented system, {{he was named}} ACC Freshman of the Year after he averaged 13.4 points per game (ppg) on 53.4% shooting (field goal percentage). He made the game-winning jump shot in the 1982 NCAA Championship game against Georgetown, which was led by future NBA rival Patrick Ewing. Jordan later described this shot as the major turning point in his basketball career. During his three seasons at North Carolina, he averaged 17.7 ppg on 54.0% shooting, and added 5.0 rebounds per game (rpg). [...] He was selected by consensus to the NCAA All-American First Team in both his sophomore (1983) and junior (1984) seasons. After winning the Naismith and the Wooden College Player of the Year awards in 1984, Jordan left North Carolina one year before his scheduled graduation to enter the 1984 NBA draft. The Chicago Bulls selected Jordan with the third overall pick, after Hakeem Olajuwon (Houston Rockets) and Sam Bowie (Portland Trail Blazers). One of the primary reasons why Jordan was not drafted sooner was because the first two teams were {{in need of a}} center. [...] However, Trail Blazers general manager Stu Inman contended {{that it was not a}} matter of drafting a center, but more a matter of taking Sam Bowie over Jordan, in part because Portland already had <b>Clyde</b> <b>Drexler,</b> who was a guard with similar skills to Jordan. ESPN, citing Bowie's injury-laden college career, named the Blazers' choice of Bowie as the worst draft pick in North American professional sports history. [...] Jordan returned to North Carolina to complete his degree in 1986.|$|E
