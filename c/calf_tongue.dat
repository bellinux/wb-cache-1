40|$|Objectives: The early {{detection}} of oral soft tissue lesions is an important prognostic factor, {{and the possibility of}} using ultrasonography (US) as a diagnostic tool may improve the diagnosis and characterization of tissue alterations at an early stage. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of intraoral US by performing a preclinical assessment of an ex vivo specimen in which focal lesions were simulated. Materials and methods: Fourteen lesions were simulated on a freshly extracted <b>calf</b> <b>tongue,</b> by introducing in the tongue different materials mimicking the appearance of various focal lesions. The specimen was scanned with a 8 MHz US probe and computed tomography (CT) was performed to compare the two imaging techniques. Later, the specimen was dissected to set a benchmark for size assessment. Results: US was able to identify all the simulated lesions within the tongue, resulting in one case more accurate than CT. Statistical analysis demonstrated high correlation between the measurements of the simulated lesions performed on the US images and the real size of the materials introduced in the tongue (p < 0. 05). Conclusions: This preclinical study proves that US performs well in the detection and characterization of simulated lesions of the tongue. These findings suggest that US could be effectively used in clinical applications. However, further research is mandatory to assess the reliability of in vivo US in the detection and characterization of tongue lesions as well as of other oral soft tissue alterations...|$|E

Without it no cattleman, nor half a hundred cowboys, if he had so many, could ever recognize all the cattle in a big herd. There are no fences on our ranges. They are all open to everybody. Some day I hope we'll be rich enough to fence a range. The different herds graze together. Every calf has to be caught, if possible, and branded with the mark of its mother. That's no easy job. A maverick is an unbranded calf that has been weaned and shifts for itself. The maverick then belongs to the man who finds it and brands it. These little calves that lose their mothers sure have a cruel time of it. Many of them die. Then the coyotes and wolves and lions prey on them. Every year we have two big round-ups, but the boys do some branding all the year. A calf should be branded as soon as it's found. This is a safeguard against cattle-thieves. We don't have the rustling of herds and bunches of cattle like we used to. But there's always the calf-thief, and always will be as long as there's cattle-raising. The thieves have a good many cunning tricks. They kill the calf's mother or slit the <b>calf's</b> <b>tongue</b> so it can't suck and so loses its mother. They steal and hide a calf and watch it till it's big enough to fare for itself, and then brand it. They make imperfect brands and finish them at a later time.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} birth stress on tongue color, length, and {{responsiveness}} was studied in fifty eight calves. The calves were monitored from stage 2 of parturition until birth. Tongue parameters (Tongue color, length, and responsiveness) were measured at two minute intervals. Immediately after birth arterial blood samples were taken and analyzed for PO 2, PCO 2, pH to establish stress levels {{as described by}} Strawn et al. (1996). Calves were then released to the farm management. Tongue length monitoring was indicative of acidosis in calves. This {{is due to the}} loss of muscle control and contractility that occurs during stress. Tongue reflex was shown to be negatively correlated with tongue length. Calves with longer tongues are less responsive to tactile stimulation. While not conclusive, our data strongly suggest that tongue parameters can be useful as predictive measures of stress, but when all three stress indicators are present in the <b>calf</b> (long <b>tongue,</b> reduced reflex, and dark color) it is more definitively indicative of stress than the presence of a single indicator...|$|R
40|$|The time {{dependence}} of the apparent diffusion tensor of ex vivo <b>calf</b> heart and <b>tongue</b> was measured for diffusion times (�d) between 32 and 810 ms. The results showed evidence of restricted diffusion in the muscle tissues of both organs. In regions where the myofibers are parallel, the largest eigenvalue (� 1) of the diffusion tensor remained {{the same for all}} diffusion times measured, while the other eigenvalues (� 2, � 3) decreased by 29 – 36 % between �d � 32 ms and �d � 400 ms. In regions where the fibers cross, the � 1 also changed, decreasing by 17 % between �d � 32 ms and �d � 400 ms. The restricting compartment size and volume fraction were effectively estimated by fitting the time courses of the eigenvalues to a model consisting of a nonrestricted compartment and a cylindrically restricted compartment. To our knowledge, this study is the first demonstrating diffusion time {{dependence of}} measured water diffusion tensor in muscular tissue. With improvement in scanning technology, future studies may permit noninvasive, in vivo detection of changes in muscle myoarchitecture due to disease, treatment...|$|R
40|$|Epithelial {{antibiotics}} {{provide a}} {{first line of}} defense against the external microbial environment. The studies presented in this thesis detail the expression and regulation of β-defensins, a family of cationic, cysteine-rich peptides with broad spectrum antimicrobial activity, in the epithelium of cow and human. ^ In {{the first part of this}} project, one such defensin, lingual antimicrobial peptide (LAP), was isolated from bovine tongue, cloned, and demonstrated to be present by in situ hybridization in the epithelium. LAP messenger RNA is present in gastrointestinal, respiratory, urinary, and facial epithelium. LAP message is markedly increased in the epithelium surrounding naturally occurring tongue lesions, coincident with the cellular hallmarks of acute and chronic inflammation. LAP RNA is present in the epithelium of <b>calf</b> and adult <b>tongue,</b> but not fetal tongue. ^ In the second part of this project, the expression of LAP message was examined in normal cattle and in animals in varying states of disease. LAP RNA was found to be widely expressed in numerous exposed epithelia, and in the nervous system. LAP message is induced in ileal mucosa during chronic infection with Mycobacterium paratuberculosis, and in bronchial epithelium following acute infection with Pasteurella haemolytica. ^ In the third part of this project, human β-defensin- 1 (hBD- 1) was cloned from human bronchial epithelium, and found to be present in a variety of tissues with exposed epithelial surfaces and ducts. hBD- 1 is also expressed in cystic fibrosis airway, and inactivated, in vitro, in high salt. These results support a hypothesis in which dysfunction of antimicrobial peptides in the high salt environment of cystic fibrosis airway may be responsible for chronic respiratory infections associated with cystic fibrosis. ^ The results presented in this thesis have helped further our understanding of the regulation of β-defensins, and define their biological role. It is now known that epithelial defensins are widely expressed, provide a rapidly mobilized local defense against infectious organisms, and are intimately involved in disease. These studies ultimately support a role for epithelial defensins in mucosal immunity. ...|$|R
