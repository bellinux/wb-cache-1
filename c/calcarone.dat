30|$|By {{manipulating}} prescription {{variables to}} produce desired fire intensities (Raybould and Roberts 1981), prescribed burning {{can be used}} to increase edge within chaparral for wildlife habitat and to increase biodiversity by creating openings for regeneration (Stephenson and <b>Calcarone</b> 1999). Low intensity prescribed burns in chaparral {{can be used to}} reduce fire hazard to riparian habitats; however, resultant hillslope erosion and dry ravel may impact riparian zones (Dougherty and Riggan 1981, Barro et al 1989). In contrast, high intensity wildfires often cause extensive changes to chaparral landscapes, which then gradually recover following various successional pathways (Keeley 2000). The ability to more accurately model fire behavior in chaparral can assist in developing prescriptions to meet ecological and management objectives.|$|E
30|$|Chaparral is a Spanish word used to {{describe}} a vegetation complex found primarily in California, extending south into Mexico and east into Arizona (Keeley 2000). The species composition of this vegetation varies throughout its range. Common woody species include chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum), ceanothus (Ceanothus spp.), manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.), and shrub oaks (Quercus spp.). Thin bands of riparian vegetation are often interspersed in chaparral along permanent and seasonal watercourses and they provide important wildlife habitat; chaparral is an important bird habitat and species composition is affected by post-fire age gradients of prescribed fires (England 1995; J. Potts, University of California, Berkeley, unpublished data). In southern California, several threatened, endangered, and sensitive plants and animals live in or rely on chaparral, riparian zones, and sage scrub complexes (Stephenson and <b>Calcarone</b> 1999).|$|E
30|$|Although {{the state}} of California {{is home to a}} high {{diversity}} of species, vegetation types, and fire regimes (Barbour et al. 2007), similarities among fire regimes and their effects on vegetation generally allow the organization of ecosystems into broad fire regime groups. Published efforts to categorize relationships between fire and vegetation in California include Agee (1993; northern California), Skinner and Chang (1996; Sierra Nevada), Stephenson and <b>Calcarone</b> (1999; southern California), Arno (2000; western US), Sugihara et al. (2006; statewide), Sawyer et al. (2010; statewide), and the LANDFIRE project (2010; Rollins 2009; entire US). Both the Sugihara et al. (2006) and Sawyer et al. (2010) efforts drew from a series of Joint Fire Science Program supported regional workshops held between 2000 and 2002 that reunited fire and vegetation experts from across the state and developed descriptions of fire regime characteristics for California vegetation communities. All of this information also fed the development of the LANDFIRE Biophysical Settings (BpS), which are potential natural vegetation (PNV) types linked to quantitative models of disturbance and succession (Rollins 2009). The disturbance-succession models for the California BpS types (which apply to the pre-Euro-American settlement period) were developed at a series of regional expert workshops sponsored by The Nature Conservancy in 2004 and 2005. After refinement and peer review, the BpS classification was finalized and mapped as part of the national LANDFIRE project (see Rollins 2009 and www.landfire.gov for details).|$|E
40|$|The {{challenges}} of managing wildland-urban areas are particularly relevant in southern California where the forests are unique from most other National Forests {{because of their}} proximity to a large urban population. In addition to the large population adjacent to the forests, uniqueness {{is found in the}} ethnic and racial diversity of the region (Allen and Turner 1992). Much of Californiaâ€™s future population growth is expected to occur as a result of international immigration and the higher fertility rates of newly arrived immigrants compared to those who have longer tenure in this country (Johnson 1999). Seventy-six percent of all immigrants entering the United States during the 1980 s went to only six states, and California received four out of every ten immigrants (Fix and others 1994). California provides a virtual laboratory for studying the dynamic relationship between land management agencies and urban populations because of its rapid social change and cultural diversity. Recent decades have shown an increasing shift in population away from the coastal counties/metropolitan areas of Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area towards the Central Valley and the Inland Empire (Fulton and others 2000, Southern California Association of Governments 1998). The environmental sensitivity of these areas compounds the complexity of managing for growth while protecting endangered species and their habitats (Fulton 1999). The mountains and foothills surrounding these populations are affected by natural disturbances (such as fire and flood), the spread of elements (such as air pollution), and human uses of the land (including draw of resources such as water, development, and recreation) (Stephenson and <b>Calcarone</b> 1999). California is already unique {{from the rest of the}} nation in its demographic diversity, as well as being the most populous state in the nation (Baldassare 2000...|$|E
