The disaster {{was caused by a}} tsunami that was quickly followed by an earthquake resulting in one of Japan’s largest nuclear damages. The land closest to the plant and nearby areas are contaminated indefinitely until Japan can conceal and remove radio cesium from the area.And one of the major ideas to conceal any further chemical leakage was to build an ice wall within the plant’s building to slow down groundwater spreading. But recent research has shown that the ice wall was proven to be ineffective to the surrounding areas. The reason why, was because of the areas’ soil migration, or <b>chemical</b> <b>adsorption.</b> Because the soil was slow absorb contaminated particles downward into the ground, it remains at the uppermost level of soil, vulnerable to erosion. Making the formation of needle ice, one of the main reason of redistribution of contaminated soil, easier to transfer the contaminated soil to surrounding areas.

50|$|Adsorption {{describes}} {{the process by}} which molecules or particles bind to surfaces and is distinguishable from absorption, whereby the particles spread in the bulk of the absorbing material. The adsorbed material is called the adsorbate, while the surface is called the adsorbent. It is common to distinguish between two types of adsorption, namely physical adsorption (which consists of intermolecular forces holding the adsorbed material to the surface) and <b>chemical</b> <b>adsorption</b> (which consists of covalent bonds tethering the adsorbed material to the surface). The nature of the layer of adsorbate formed depends on the interactions between the adsorbed material and the adsorbent. More specifically, the mechanisms involved in adsorption include ion exchange (replacement of counter ions adsorbed from the solution by similarly charged ions), ion pairing (adsorption of ions from solution phase onto sites on the substrates that carry the opposite charge), hydrophobic bonding (non-polar attraction between groups on the substrate surface and molecules in solution), polarization of p-electrons polar interactions between partially charged sites on the substrate surface and molecules carrying opposite partial charges in solution, and covalent bonds. The variety of ways for adsorption to occur provides an indication of the complexities associated with controlling the type of layer that is adsorbed. The type of silane used can further compound the problem, {{as in the case of}} APTES. APTES is the classical molecule used for the immobilization of biomolecules and has historically been the most widely studied molecule in the field by far. Since APTES contains three ethoxy groups per molecule, it can polymerize in the presence of water, leading to lateral polymerization between APTES molecules in horizontal and vertical directions and the formation of oligomers and polymers which can attach to the surface.|$|E

40|$|Charge {{inversion}} is {{the phenomenon}} {{in which an}} electric double layer contains more counterions than needed to compensate the surface charge. For colloidal particles this has the consequence that the apparent surface charge, as inferred from electrophoresis or interaction studies, has a sign opposite {{to that of the}} actual surface charge, obtainable by titration. This phenomenon has been known for over a century. According to the traditional interpretation, the inversion is caused by (<b>chemical)</b> specific <b>adsorption</b> of ions. However, beginning in the early 1980 s it has been predicted by a large number of workers that charge inversion should occur as a consequence of many-body ion-ion correlations. For surfaces of sufficiently high surface charge density in the presence of divalent or multivalent counterions, charge inversion is expected to be ubiquitous {{even in the absence of}} specific adsorption. Testing this prediction has proved difficult because <b>chemical</b> specific <b>adsorption</b> is a very common phenomenon and can outweigh the effects of ion correlations. So far, no experimental systems have been thoroughly investigated where strong specific adsorption could be unambiguously ruled out under conditions where charge inversion due to ion-ion correlations is predicted. Here, we solve this problem by studying the mercury/aqueous MgSO 4 interface. This system has the advantage that highly accurate double layer data are available for a variety of conditions, including some where <b>chemical</b> specific <b>adsorption</b> is known to be absent (or at least very weak). From precise data for this system [Harrison, J. A.; Randles, J. E. B.; Schiffrin, D. J. J. Electroanal. Chem. 1970, 25, 197] one can establish the ionic components of charge and surface charge density. To extract quantitative theoretical predictions about the consequences of ion-ion correlations, we use the highly accurate anisotropic hypernetted chain (AHNC) method, where ion-ion correlations in the double layer are taken into account in a fully self-consistent fashion. It is found that for moderate to large negative surface charge densities and not too high concentration, the variation in the ionic components of charge with the surface charge density can to a large extent be quantitatively explained by enrichment of ions close to the surface due to ion-ion correlations. That <b>chemical</b> specific <b>adsorption</b> of Mg 2 + is negligible is supported by considering the properties of the double layer close to the electrocapillary maximum. In view of the large body of evidence indicating that the counterions tend to specifically adsorb on the mercury surface for positive polarization but not for negative, the agreement between theory and experiment for negative surface charge constitutes strong evidence for ion-ion correlations as the origin of charge inversio...|$|R

30|$|Sorption average {{energy of}} (E), free energy {{involved}} in the transference of 1  mol of the solute of the solution for the adsorbent surface, defines whether adsorption is physical or chemical (Wan Ngah and Hanafiah 2008).

Consequently, biosorbents from jatropha endosperm (E) and from endosperm + peel (E + T) and activated coal have E rates higher than 8.0  kJ mol− 1, and thus the predominance of <b>chemical</b> <b>adsorption</b> in the adsorption process. Once more the above corroborates the best adjustment of Langmuir’s model, since <b>chemical</b> <b>adsorption</b> occurs in monolayers (Montanher et al. 2005). Since E rate equivalent to 7.603  kJ mol− 1 was obtained for the jatropha bark (C), physical adsorption was predominant. However, it should be underscored that the rate was close to 8.0  kJ mol− 1 and that the D–R model had the lowest R 2 rate for the biosorbent. Consequently, there is no absolute certainty that the Cd 2 + adsorption process in jatropha active was a physical adsorption.|$|E
