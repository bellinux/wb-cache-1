25|$|Hydrogen {{chloride}} forms corrosive {{hydrochloric acid}} on contact with water found in body tissue. Inhalation of the fumes can cause coughing, choking, {{inflammation of the}} nose, throat, and upper respiratory tract, and in severe cases, pulmonary edema, circulatory system failure, and death.

25|$|Veratrum nigrum {{contains}} more than 200 steroid-derived alkaloids, including isorubijervine, jervine, pseudojervine, rubijervine, tienmuliumine, tienmuliluminine, and verazine. The herb causes irritation of mucous membranes. When ingested, the irritation of the mucosal membranes of the stomach and intestines will cause nausea and vomiting. If the herb is introduced to the nose, this mucosal irritation will cause sneezing and coughing. Ingestion can also cause bradycardia (slow heart rate), hyperactivity, and hypotension (low blood pressure). In high concentrations, topical <b>contact</b> <b>can</b> cause skin irritation, excessive tears from the eyes, and redness.|$|E
25|$|Where {{herbicides}} {{cannot be}} used, mowing may be repeated about every three weeks, as it grows back rapidly. In the past, ragweed was usually cut down, left to dry, and then burned. This method is used less often now, {{because of the}} pollution caused by smoke. Manually uprooting ragweed is generally ineffective, and skin <b>contact</b> <b>can</b> cause allergic reaction. If uprooting is the method of choice, it should be performed before flowering. There is evidence that mechanical and chemical control methods are actually no more effective {{in the long run}} than leaving the weed in place.|$|E

50|$|The {{effects of}} <b>contact</b> bounce <b>can</b> be {{eliminated}} {{by use of}} mercury-wetted contacts, but these are now infrequently used because of the hazard of mercury release. Alternatively, <b>contact</b> circuit voltages <b>can</b> be low-pass filtered to reduce or eliminate multiple pulses from appearing.

25|$|The {{temperature}} of corium {{can be as}} high as 2400°C (4,352 °F) in the first hours after the meltdown, potentially reaching over 2800°C (5,072 °F). A large amount of heat can be released by reaction of metals (particularly zirconium) in corium with water. Flooding of the corium mass with water, or the drop of molten corium mass into a water pool, may result in a temperature spike and production of large amounts of hydrogen, which can result in a pressure spike in the containment vessel. The steam explosion resulting from such sudden corium-water <b>contact</b> <b>can</b> disperse the materials and form projectiles that may damage the containment vessel by impact. Subsequent pressure spikes can be caused by combustion of the released hydrogen. Detonation risks can be reduced by the use of catalytic hydrogen recombiners.|$|E
25|$|There is an {{increased}} risk of STI transmission if the receiving partner has wounds on his or her genitals, or if the giving partner has wounds or open sores on or in his or her mouth, or bleeding gums. Brushing the teeth, flossing, undergoing dental work soon before or after performing oral sex can also increase the risk of transmission, because all of these activities can cause small scratches in the lining of the mouth. These wounds, even when they are microscopic, increase the chances of contracting STIs that can be transmitted orally under these conditions. Such <b>contact</b> <b>can</b> also lead to more mundane infections from common bacteria and viruses found in, around and secreted from the genital regions. Because of the aforementioned factors, medical sources advise the use of condoms or other effective barrier methods when performing or receiving oral sex with a partner whose STI status is unknown.|$|E

2500|$|Oxalic acid is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula C2H2O4. It is a colorless crystalline solid that forms a colorless solution in water.

Oxalic acid is a reducing agent [...] and its conjugate base, known as oxalate (...) , is a chelating agent for metal cations. Typically, oxalic acid occurs as the dihydrate with the formula C2H2O4·2H2O. Excessive ingestion of oxalic acid or prolonged skin <b>contact</b> <b>can</b> be dangerous.|$|E
2500|$|... “Tetraloop {{receptor}} motifs” are long-range tertiary interactions [...] {{consisting of}} hydrogen bonding between the bases in the tetraloop to stemloop sequences in distal sections of the secondary RNA structure.

[...] For example, in GNRA-tetraloop interactions, the second nucleotide of the tetraloop stacks directly on an A-platform motif (see above) within the receptor. [...] The sequence of the tetraloop and its receptor often covary so that the same type of tertiary <b>contact</b> <b>can</b> be made with different isoforms of the tetraloop and its cognate receptor.|$|E

[...] Drum dances are the [...] "only truly indigenous music" [...] in Greenland, and are part of a roots revival in modern times. Shamans used drums as part of their religious affairs and sometimes organized singing duels between rivals in which the performer who got the most laughs from the audience won. Inuit drum dances were a declining tradition and in modern Greenland are being replaced by amateur theater groups like Silamiut, who used elements of indigenous music with masks, face painting and other techniques.|$|E
2500|$|The set is {{the second}} team contact, and its purpose is to {{position}} the ball for {{an attack on the}} third hit. [...] A hand setting motion is often used, but bump setting, an underhand motion in which the ball bounces off the forearms, is also common. When using the hand motion contact for the setting the player's hands must contact the ball simultaneously. If a referee determines that a double-hit has occurred, the point will be given to the other team. [...] Excessive spin after a ball has been set is often used as an indicator of a double contact fault, but causing a ball to spin while setting is not explicitly prohibited. After completing the contact, the setter typically turns his attention to the defense and communicates to his partner whether a blocker is up and which area of the court is open. [...] The second <b>contact</b> <b>can</b> also be used to attack the ball.|$|E
2500|$|A contest {{score is}} {{computed}} {{based on a}} formula defined for that contest. [...] A typical formula assigns some number of points for each contact, and a [...] "multiplier" [...] based on {{some aspect of the}} exchanged information. [...] The rules for most contests held on the VHF amateur radio bands in North America assign a new multiplier for each new Maidenhead grid locator in the log, rewarding the competitors that make contacts with other stations in the most locations. [...] Many HF contests reward stations with a new multiplier for contacts with stations in each country - often based on the [...] "entities" [...] listed on the DXCC country list maintained by the American Radio Relay League ("ARRL"). [...] Depending on the rules for a particular contest, each multiplier may count once on each radio band or only once during the contest, regardless of the radio band on which the multiplier was first earned. [...] The points earned for each <b>contact</b> <b>can</b> be a fixed amount per contact, or can vary based on a geographical relationship such as whether or not the communications crossed a continental or political boundary. [...] Some contests, such as the Stew Perry Top Band Distance Challenge, award points are scaled to the distance separating the two stations. [...] Most contests held in Europe on the VHF and microwave bands award 1 point per kilometre of distance between the stations making each contact.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{study the}} problem of {{fixturing}} a chain of hinged objects in a given placement with frictionless point contacts. We define the notions of immobility and robust immobility, which are comparable to second and first order immobility for a single object [8, 7, 11, 12] robust immobility differs from immobility in that it additionally requires insensitivity to small perturbations of contacts. We show that (p + 2) frictionless point <b>contacts</b> <b>can</b> immobilize any chain of p � = 3 polygons without parallel edges; it is unclear that five <b>contacts</b> <b>can</b> immobilize any three polygons in general, Any chain of p arbitrary polygons can be immobilized with at most (p + 3) contacts. We also show that ⌈ 6 5 (p + 2) ⌉ contacts suffice to robustly immobilize p polygons without parallel edges, and that ⌈ 5 4 (p + 2) ⌉ <b>contacts</b> <b>can</b> robustly immobilize p arbitrary polygons. ...|$|R
