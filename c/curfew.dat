In addition, the crew were aware that due to noise abatement restrictions, their jet aircraft was required to land at Aspen by the 18:58 MST night <b>curfew.</b> Following the delayed departure from LAX, their estimated arrival time was 18:46 MST, twelve minutes before the <b>curfew</b> took effect.|$|E
40|$|Faced {{with rising}} crime rates, many {{municipalities}} {{in recent years}} have enacted juvenile <b>curfews.</b> Professor Tona Trollinger uses an ordinance enacted in Dallas, Texas, as a framework for analyzing juvenile <b>curfews.</b> The author discusses various prudential and constitutional objections to these <b>curfews,</b> including both substantive and procedural due process challenges. The author concludes that the admittedly valid governmental objectives underlying such <b>curfews</b> do not override their constitutional infirmities...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the recent extension {{of the scope of}} youth <b>curfews.</b> A critical analysis of the desirability of this widening of status laws is then offered, with an initial focus on libertarian issues, followed by a consideration of the predicted efficacy of youth <b>curfews</b> in the field of crime control. As the use of youth <b>curfews</b> has been prevalent in the United States since their revival in the early 1990 s, a comparative analysis is possible. It is argued that the use of youth <b>curfews</b> is questionable both in terms of their implications for human rights and freedoms and as regards their utility...|$|R

However, despite these achievements, Estrada only narrowly won over Lim in their electoral rematch in 2016. Recently, the City Government is planning to revise existing <b>curfew</b> ordinance since the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional on August 2017. Out of the three cities reviewed by the Supreme Court, namely: the City of Manila, Navotas and Quezon City; only the <b>curfew</b> ordinance of Quezon City was approved.|$|E
5|$|In January 1947, the 6th Airborne Division {{was moved}} to {{northern}} Palestine, swapping locations with the 1st Infantry Division. The 3rd Parachute Brigade took over responsibility for Haifa, which was considered a problem area. The brigade had to guard the docks and port of Haifa, which were the main entry point for immigrants arriving in the country. In addition, the many oil pipelines and installations in the region were a potential target for sabotage. The brigade's first operation was imposing a <b>curfew</b> on the Jewish quarter after the kidnapping of two Britons {{in retaliation for the}} death sentence imposed on Dov Gruner. The next major operation was in July, when an indefinite night time <b>curfew</b> was imposed, in response to several attacks in and around the city. The <b>curfew</b> lasted {{until the end of the}} month.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the impact of juvenile <b>curfews</b> on the criminal activities of young adults. Using individual-level data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth - Geocode (NLSY) data set and estimating an economic model of crime for young adults, this study finds that although <b>curfews</b> have no statistically significant effect on the criminal behaviour of young adults, they do have a negative effect on the arrests of young adults. These results differ somewhat from the results of prior studies but lend support to community officials who believe that <b>curfews</b> are an effective tool in combating juvenile crime. ...|$|R

5|$|On June 12, 1942, Judge James Alger Fee of the United States District Court for the District of Oregon began {{presiding}} over the non-jury trial of Yasui, the first case challenging the <b>curfew</b> {{to make it to}} court. The trial was held at the Federal Courthouse in Portland. Fee determined in his ruling issued on November 16, 1942, that the <b>curfew</b> could only apply to aliens, as martial law had not been imposed by the government. However, he also ruled that because Yasui had worked for the Japanese government he had forfeited his citizenship, so that the <b>curfew</b> did apply to him. Fee sentenced Yasui to one year in jail, which was served at the Multnomah County Jail, and $5,000 fine. This federal court decision with constitutional and war power issues made news around the country.|$|E
5|$|The {{night of}} 30 to 31 January was quieter in Cairo, with fewer reports of looting. For {{the fourth day}} in a row the <b>curfew</b> was {{violated}} without repercussions.

5|$|Citing Hirabayashi, Chief Justice Stone {{wrote the}} opinion of the court, and {{determined}} that the <b>curfew</b> and exclusion orders were valid, even as applied to citizens of the United States. Stone’s opinion was three pages and did not contain any concurring opinions or dissents, while the Hirabayashi decision had thirty-four pages and two concurring opinions. In Yasui the court affirmed his conviction of the misdemeanor, but ordered re-sentencing since the lower court had determined that the <b>curfew</b> was not valid, and that Yasui had forfeited his citizenship. The Supreme Court remanded (returned) the case back to the district court to determine a sentence in light of these circumstances.|$|E

5|$|In the 1950s and the 1960s, Paris {{became one}} {{front of the}} Algerian War for independence; in August 1961, the pro-independence FLN {{targeted}} and killed 11 Paris policemen, leading to {{the imposition of a}} <b>curfew</b> on Muslims of Algeria (who, at that time, were French citizens). On 17 October 1961, an unauthorised but peaceful protest demonstration of Algerians against the <b>curfew</b> led to violent confrontations between the police and demonstrators, in which at least 40 people were killed, including some thrown into the Seine. The anti-independence Organisation armée secrète (OAS), for their part, carried out a series of bombings in Paris throughout 1961 and 1962.|$|E
5|$|Maryland {{freshman}} {{wide receiver}} Torrey Smith, with his 99-yard kickoff return touchdown, broke the all-time ACC record for single-season kickoff returns with 1,089yards. Maryland running back Da'Rel Scott rushed for 174yards, earning Most Valuable Player honors alongside Nevada quarterback Colin Kaepernick who threw for 370yards. Scott set the University of Maryland's record for rushing {{yards in a}} bowl game, in what was just one-and-half quarters of playing time due to his <b>curfew</b> suspension. He also broke the 1,000-yard per season barrier, making him one of just seven players in school history to do so. Four Maryland back-ups who saw significant play due to the <b>curfew</b> suspensions also scored touchdowns: second-string X-receiver Torrey Smith, second-string slot receiver Ronnie Tyler, third-string slot receiver Adrian Cannon, and third-string running back Morgan Green.|$|E

50|$|States and {{municipalities}} in the United States have occasionally enacted <b>curfews</b> {{on the population}} at large, often {{as a result of}} severely inclement weather or political unrest.

5|$|China's newly commercialized {{society was}} evident in the {{differences}} between its northern capital and the earlier Tang capital at Chang'an. A center of great wealth, Chang'an's importance as the political center eclipsed its importance as a commercial entrepôt; Yangzhou was the economic hub of China during the Tang period. On the other hand, Kaifeng's role as a commercial center in China was as important as its political role. After the <b>curfew</b> was abolished in 1063, marketplaces in Kaifeng were open every hour of the day, whereas a strict <b>curfew</b> was imposed upon the two official marketplaces of Tang era Chang'an starting at dusk; this <b>curfew</b> limited its commercial potential. Shopkeepers and peddlers in Kaifeng began selling their goods at dawn. Along the wide avenue of the Imperial Way, breakfast delicacies were sold in shops and stalls and peddlers offered hot water for washing the face at the entrances of bathhouses. Lively activity in the markets did not begin to wane until about the evening meal of the day, while noodle shops remained open all day and night. People in the Song era were also more eager to purchase houses located near bustling markets than in earlier periods. Kaifeng's wealthy, multi-story houses and common urban dwellings were situated along the streets of the city, rather than hidden inside walled compounds and gated wards as they had been in the earlier Tang capital.|$|E

There were plans to enact a <b>curfew</b> but this was abandoned.|$|E

Police were ordered to shoot those who defied the 21:00 to 05:00 <b>curfew,</b> and troops in full camouflage battle dress guarded every major intersection and bridge with automatic weapons bearing fixed bayonets. The empty pagodas were ringed by troops and armored cars. All outgoing news was censored, forcing reporters to smuggle their copy out with travelers flying to foreign countries. The telephone lines in the homes and offices of all U.S. military and embassy staff were disconnected. The head of the USAID mission, Joe Brant, was stopped and searched while commuting to work, and other American officials had their meetings with Vietnamese officials and applications for permits to travel after the <b>curfew</b> hours delayed. The 14,000 U.S. military advisers in the country were given orders to stay in their homes, and all leave was canceled.|$|E
