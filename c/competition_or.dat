5|$|Team GB was {{represented}} by seven athletes in the Judo events. No British Judoka made it past the quarterfinal stages of <b>competition</b> <b>or</b> through to the medal match of the repechage, meaning the team {{failed to meet the}} two medal target set by UK Sport.|$|E
5|$|Biological control {{can affect}} {{biodiversity}} through predation, parasitism, pathogenicity, <b>competition,</b> <b>or</b> other attacks on non-target species. An introduced control {{does not always}} target only the intended pest species; it can also target native species. In Hawaii during the 1940s parasitic wasps were introduced to control a lepidopteran pest and the wasps are still found there today. This may {{have a negative impact}} on the native ecosystem, however, host range and impacts need to be studied before declaring their impact on the environment.|$|E
5|$|On {{the last}} day of the <b>competition,</b> <b>Or</b> Sasson won a bronze medal in the Men's +100 kg. He won the first round by waza-ari, awasete-ippon against Egyptian judoka Islam El Shehaby. El Shehaby refused to shake Sasson hand at the end of the match. At the second round, he won by points with a waza-ari. Sasson {{defeated}} Roy Meyer at the quarterfinals by points with a waza-ari but lost in the semifinals by points after Teddy Riner got waza-ari during the fight. Sasson won the fight for the bronze medal by a penalty.|$|E

5|$|Sexual {{selection}} as first articulated by Darwin (using {{the example of}} the peacock's tail) refers specifically to competition for mates, which can be intrasexual, between individuals of the same sex, that is male–male <b>competition,</b> <b>or</b> intersexual, where one gender chooses mates, most often with males displaying and females choosing. However, in some species, mate choice is primarily by males, as in some fishes of the family Syngnathidae.|$|E
5|$|During the story, Tommy meets {{characters}} from various gangs. As the player completes missions for different gangs, fellow gang members will often defend the player, while rival gang members will recognise the player and subsequently shoot on sight. While free roaming the game world, the player may {{engage in activities}} such as a vigilante minigame, a fire fighting activity, and a taxi cab service. Completion of these activities grants the player with context-specific rewards. As Tommy builds his criminal empire, the player may purchase a number of properties distributed across the city, some of which act as additional hideouts where weapons can be collected and vehicles can be stored. There are also a variety of businesses which can be purchased, including a film studio, a taxi company, and several entertainment clubs. Each commercial property {{has a number of}} missions attached to it, such as eliminating <b>competition</b> <b>or</b> stealing equipment; once all missions are complete, the property begins to generate an ongoing income available for the player.|$|E
5|$|One {{family of}} pterosaurs, Azhdarchidae, was {{definitely}} {{present in the}} Maastrichtian, and it likely became extinct at the K–Pg boundary. These large pterosaurs were the last representatives of a declining group that contained ten families during the mid-Cretaceous. Several other pterosaur lineages may have been present during the Maastrichtian, such as the ornithocheirids, pteranodontids, nyctosaurids, as well as, a possible tapejarid, though they are represented by fragmentary remains {{that are difficult to}} assign to any given group. While this was occurring, modern birds were undergoing diversification; traditionally it was thought that they replaced archaic birds and pterosaur groups, possibly due to direct <b>competition,</b> <b>or</b> they simply filled empty niches, but there is no correlation between pterosaur and avian diversities that are conclusive to a competition hypothesis, and small pterosaurs were present in the Late Cretaceous.|$|E

5|$|The Courthouse was {{designed}} by Jersey City native Hugh Roberts, twice {{a president of the}} New Jersey Chapter of the American Institute of Architects. Roberts, brother-in-law of future United States Senator and New Jersey Governor Edward I. Edwards, received a direct appointment as architect. No <b>competition</b> <b>or</b> bidding for designs was held, causing controversy among local architects. The property on which the courthouse stands was obtained from fourteen separate property owners between 1905 and 1914. The groundbreaking took place on March 21, 1906 and the cornerstone was laid on December 12, 1906. Construction of the building was done by Wells Brothers of New York City and construction of the interiors and finishes were by John Gill & Son of Cleveland, Ohio.|$|E
5|$|The {{eggs are}} oval, white and {{coarsely}} textured. All species normally lay {{at least two}} eggs; the usual clutch size is one to three, rarely up to six. Both sexes incubate with the eggs on top of or below the feet; they may display when changing shifts. Incubation takes 30–36 days; hatching success for undisturbed pairs can {{be as high as}} 95 percent but, because of sibling <b>competition</b> <b>or</b> siblicide, in the wild usually all but one nestling dies within the first few weeks (later in the pink-backed and spot-billed species). Both parents feed their young. Small chicks are fed by regurgitation; after about a week they are able to put their heads into their parent’s pouch and feed themselves. Sometimes before, or especially after, being fed, they may seem to have a seizure that ends in falling unconscious; the reason is not clearly known.|$|E
