It also changed CEC capacitance limits, and CEC commands for timer control were brought back in an altered form, with audio <b>control</b> <b>commands</b> added. It also added the optional ability to stream SACD in its bitstream DST format rather than uncompressed raw DSD.|$|E
25|$|With older {{supercharged}} aircraft, {{the pilot}} must continually adjust the throttle {{to maintain the}} required manifold pressure during ascent or descent. The pilot must also take care to avoid over-boosting the engine and causing damage. In contrast, modern turbocharger systems use an automatic wastegate, which controls the manifold pressure within parameters preset by the manufacturer. For these systems, {{as long as the}} control system is working properly and the pilot's <b>control</b> <b>commands</b> are smooth and deliberate, a turbocharger cannot over-boost the engine and damage it.|$|E
25|$|The {{instantaneous}} {{attitude of}} the vehicle was compared with the desired vehicle attitude in the LVDC. Attitude correction signals from the LVDC were converted into <b>control</b> <b>commands</b> by the flight control computer. The required thrust direction was obtained by gimbaling the engines in the propelling stage to change the thrust direction of the vehicle. Gimbaling of these engines was accomplished through hydraulic actuators. In {{the first and second}} stages (S-IC and S-II), the four outboard engines were gimbaled to control roll, pitch, and yaw. Since the third (S-IVB) stage has only one engine, an auxiliary propulsion system was used for roll control during powered flight. The auxiliary propulsion system provides complete attitude control during coast flight of the S-IUB/IU stage.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Safety {{is seen as}} a must, for railway {{transport}} market. However it is not so obvious what does safety exactly mean as it means different things for different experts. Showing safety ensured by <b>control</b> <b>command</b> systems as a component of the railway operational safety and pointing associated challenges especially those arising from subdivision of the national railway system into different entities. Methodology. To achieve this purpose <b>control</b> <b>command</b> and signalling systems keeping safe distances between trains, preventing setting conflicting train routs, locking of the mobile elements of the switches, protecting the level crossings, enabling safe incorporation of additional trains were analyzed. Findings. Article analyses how <b>control</b> <b>command</b> system influence operational safety taking into account safety of the control-command system itself, interfaces on one side between signalling systems and <b>control</b> <b>command</b> system {{and on the other side}} between <b>control</b> <b>command</b> system and vehicle control systems, transmission, maintenance, and operation in degraded modes of running. Originality. New and high-effective scope of tests which are necessary for putting new <b>control</b> <b>command</b> installation into service both track-side and on-board are proposed. Practical value. <b>Control</b> <b>command</b> implementations will significantly improve operational safety, however it is possible only when recommendations defined in this article are taken into account. This means that all the components including interfaces have to meet acceptable hazard rate 10 E- 9 and have to be properly design, constructed, assembled and maintained, all taking into account whole chain of functions performed and supervised by different railway entities...|$|R
40|$|Traditional <b>control</b> <b>command</b> system {{relies on}} input {{devices such as}} a remote {{controller}} to input commands to a system. However, such command system is single-user only, not intuitive, and requires an additional input device. In contrast, this work presents a <b>control</b> <b>command</b> system which merely relies on hand motions. The system consists of two inexpensive commodity cameras and a desktop computer. The acquired images are processed using foreground human user hand extraction, command cube detection and activation, depth filtering, and command recognition. The proposed command cube limits the computation complexity while the depth filtering increases the system robustness. The presented <b>control</b> <b>command</b> system can successfully achieve <b>control</b> <b>command</b> processing at a frame rate of 5 fps even with other people moving in the scene. 1...|$|R

2500|$|The Reeves AN/MSQ-77 Bomb Directing Central, Radar (nickname [...] "Miscue 77") was a USAF {{automatic}} tracking radar/computer system for command guidance of military aircraft during Vietnam War bomb runs at nighttime and during bad weather. [...] Developed from the Reeves AN/MSQ-35, the AN/MSQ-77 reversed {{the process of}} Radar Bomb Scoring by continually estimating the bomb impact point before bomb release with a vacuum tube ballistic computer.

2500|$|The [...] "black boxes", {{the flight}} data {{recorder}} (FDR) and cockpit voice recorder (CVR), along with the quick access recorder (QAR), were recovered from the aircraft {{within hours of the}} accident, and transported to the AAIB's Farnborough headquarters, some thirty miles from Heathrow. The information downloaded from these devices confirmed what the crew had already told the investigators, that the engines had not responded when the throttles were advanced during final approach.Recorded data indicates that an adequate fuel quantity was on board the aircraft and that the autothrottle and engine <b>control</b> <b>commands</b> were performing as expected prior to, and after, the reduction in thrust.All possible scenarios that could explain the thrust reduction and continued lack of response of the engines to throttle lever inputs are being examined, in close co-operation with Boeing, Rolls Royce and British Airways. This work includes a detailed analysis and examination of the complete fuel flow path from the aircraft tanks to the engine fuel nozzles.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{intelligent}} {{control of a}} particular Catalytic Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) is addressed. <b>Control</b> <b>command</b> {{is the sum of}} two components: steady state and transient commands. A fuzzy controller generates a transient <b>control</b> <b>command</b> that pushes the system towards the setpoint. A steady state <b>control</b> <b>command</b> is generated to maintain the steady state situation at the setpoint (based on the concept of 'control equilibrium point'). For comparison, a case study was also controlled by the neuro-predictive algorithm. The studied CSTR is known as a good example of a neuro-predictive control application; however, the newly proposed hybrid intelligent method leads to much better setpoint tracking as well as less change in <b>control</b> <b>command</b> (which is very important in implementation of the control system).
