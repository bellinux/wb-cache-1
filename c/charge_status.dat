40|$|Germanium has higher hole {{mobility}} {{and is a}} candidate for replacing silicon for pMOSFETs. This work reviews the recent progresses in understanding the negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) of Ge pMOSFETs and compares it with SiON/Si devices. Both Ge and SiON/Si devices have two groups of defects: as-grown hole traps (AHT) and generated defects (GDs). The generation process, however, is different: GDs are interface-controlled for SiON/Si and dielectric-controlled for Ge devices. This leads to substantially higher GDs under DC stress than under AC stress for Ge, although they are similar for SiON/Si devices. Moreover, GDs alter their energy levels with <b>charge</b> <b>status</b> and can be reset to original precursor states after neutralization for Ge, but these processes are insignificant for SiON/Si. The impact of these differences on lifetime prediction will be presented and the defects and physical mechanism will be explored...|$|E

30|$|In Fig.  1, {{the switch}} (1) is an {{electronic}} SPST which controls the <b>charging</b> <b>status</b> of the lithium battery. It maintains the switch-off status as default, {{which means that}} the battery is not charged. If and only if the battery voltage is underneath the predefined level, the voltage comparator (1) triggers the switch (1) on, and the battery is charged at once if the solar panel could afford it. As soon as the charging starts for a few seconds, the battery voltage rises rapidly and changes the state of the comparator (1). That is why a RS trigger is required to keep the <b>charging</b> <b>status.</b> The control chip of the charging circuit is CN 3063 [38]. As charging is terminated, the pin END of the chip changes to low level, which turns the switch (1) off and disconnects the charging circuit. The switch status is also maintained by the RS trigger.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Cyclotides {{comprise}} {{a family of}} circular mini-peptides that have been isolated from various plants and have {{a wide range of}} bioactivities. Previous studies have demonstrated that cyclotides have antitumor effects and cause cell death by membrane permeabilization. The present study aimed to evaluate the cytotoxicity and chemosensitizing activities of cyclotides from Clitoria ternatea in paclitaxel-resistant lung cancer cells. In this study, a total of seven cyclotides were selected for colorimetric cell viability assay (MTT assay) to evaluate their anticancer and chemosensitizing activities in the lung cancer cell line A 549 and its sub-line A 549 /paclitaxel. Results suggested that certain cyclotides had significant anticancer and chemosensitizing abilities; such cyclotides were capable of causing multi-fold decreases in the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) value of cliotides in the presence of paclitaxel. More importantly, their bioactivi-ties were found to be correlated with their net <b>charge</b> <b>status.</b> In conclusion, cyclotides from C. ternatea have potential in chemosensitization application...|$|E
40|$|Glomerular {{capillary}} wall anionic {{sites have}} been demonstrated by cationic gold staining of archived renal biopsy tissue (up to 10 years old), obtained from six patients, originally embedded in paraffin wax, and subsequently reprocessed into LR gold resin. The staining patterns at pH 2. 5 and pH 7. 0, demonstrating different glomerular basement membrane (GBM) anionic constituents, were compared in three patients from whom tissue directly processed into LR gold and reprocessed tissue was available. Ultrastructural preservation was poorer and shrinkage artefact greater in paraformaldehyde-lysine periodate (PLP) as opposed to formol saline-fixed reprocessed tissue. However, GBM anionic site expression was well preserved, or even enhanced (lamina rara externa, pH 7. 0) in reprocessed tissue, using either fixative. Although {{it may not be}} possible to compare subtle changes in anionic site distribution in variously fixed and processed tissues, due to these artefacts, the technique enables retrospective study of <b>charge</b> <b>status</b> in archived material from disease groups in which there are distinct anionic site aberrations...|$|E
40|$|Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) is {{a progressive}} fatal neurodegenerative disease that primarily affects motor neurons {{in the brain}} and spinal cord. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have neuroprotective effects potentially useful for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases including ALS; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying their potential efficacy is not well understood. Here we report that protein acetylation in urea-soluble proteins is differently regulated in post-mortem ALS spinal cord. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2 -DE) analysis reveals several protein clusters with similar molecular weight but different <b>charge</b> <b>status.</b> Liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) identifies glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) as the dominant component in the protein clusters. Further analysis indicates six heavily acetylated lysine residues at positions 89, 153, 189, 218, 259 and 331 of GFAP. Immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting confirms that the larger form of GFAP fragments are acetylated and upregulated in ALS spinal cord. Further studies demonstrate that acetylation of the proteins additional to GFAP is differently regulated, suggesting that acetylation and/or deacetylation {{play an important role in}} pathogenesis of ALS...|$|E

40|$|Copyright © 2009 MC 2 D & MITI Abstract: This work {{is part of}} {{a larger}} project aiming at the {{optimization}} of an hybrid electric vehicle with series design. The final objective of the optimization process is the identification of the most efficient vehicle management strategy in order to reduce the emissions, fuel consumption without deteriorating the batteries. In order to achieve this objective the whole system modellization is mandatory. The considered vehicle can be roughly divided in 5 blocks: engine, alternator, lead acid battery pack, electric wheels, vehicle body structure. The choice of series design and lead acid battery instead of the more performing parallel architecture with lithium battery was due to the aims of producing an low cost and very small vehicle. For the same reason supercapacitor and regenerative brake are not considered. Each block will be modelled with opportune Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) or Differential Algebraic Equations (DAEs). The derived model of each block will be validated with experimental measurements.

40|$|The seismic {{potential}} of any regional seismogenic area is analyzed {{in terms of}} the "open physical system" inflow - outflow energy balance model (Thanassoulas, 2008, Part - I). Following the magnitude determination method presented by Thanassoulas, (2008, Part - II) any region of any arbitrary area extent is assumed as being a potential seismogenic region. Consequently, the capability for the generation of a maximum magnitude future EQ at each virtual seismogenic region is investigated all over Greece at certain times. The later results are used to compile maps of the seismic potential / maximum expected EQ magnitude for Greece at 5 year's intervals ranging from 1970 to 2000. The comparison of these seismic potential maps / maximum expected EQ magnitude to the corresponding seismicity (M> 6 R) for each corresponding 5 years period reveals their tight interrelation. Therefore, the calculated seismic potential / maximum expected EQ magnitude, due to its drastic change in time in any seismogenic region, is a dynamic in time parameter which indicates the seismic energy <b>charge</b> <b>status</b> of each seismogenic area.

40|$|The doping-dependent {{photoconductive}} {{properties of}} individual GaAs nanowires {{have been studied}} by conductive atomic force microscopy. Linear responsivity against the bias voltage is observed for moderate n-doped GaAs wires with a Schottky contact under illumination, while that of the undoped ones exhibits a saturated response. The carrier lifetime of a single nanowire {{can be obtained by}} simulating the characteristic photoelectric behavior. Consistent with the photoluminescence results, the significant drop of minority hole lifetime, from several hundred to subpicoseconds induced by n-type doping, leads to the distinct photoconductive features. Moreover, by comparing with the photoelectric behavior of AlGaAs shelled nanowires, the equivalent recombination rate of carriers at the surface is assessed to be > 1 × 10 (12) s(- 1) for 2 × 10 (17) cm(- 3) n-doped bare nanowires, nearly 30 times higher than that of the doping-related bulk effects. This work suggests that intentional doping in nanowires could change the <b>charge</b> <b>status</b> of the surface states and impose significant impact on the electrical and photoelectrical performances of semiconductor nanostructures...|$|E
