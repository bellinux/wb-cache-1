She also holds a shakti and hala (plough). Such a Varahi sculpture is found at Abanesi, depicted with the dancing Shiva. She may also be depicted holding a <b>child</b> <b>sitting</b> on her lap, like Matrikas are often depicted.|$|E
5|$|Co-produced by Phil Spector and {{featuring}} the latter's signature Wall of Sound {{in a live}} setting, the fundraiser album was delayed for three months due to protracted negotiations between Harrison and two record companies keen to protect their business interests, Capitol and Columbia/CBS. Besides the main performers, the musicians and singers on the recording include Badfinger, Jim Horn, Klaus Voormann, Alla Rakha, Jim Keltner, Jesse Ed Davis and Claudia Linnear. The box set's original packaging included a 64-page book containing photos from the concerts; the album cover, designed by Tom Wilkes, consisted of {{an image of a}} malnourished <b>child</b> <b>sitting</b> beside an empty food bowl.|$|E

25|$|A {{group of}} the founders of Burtelashen is {{depicted}} on three columns of the western part of its rotunda. The picture consisted of relief figures of the Holy Virgin with the <b>Child,</b> <b>sitting</b> on a throne, and two standing men in rich attire, one of them holding a model of the temple.|$|E
25|$|On {{the left}} in the {{foreground}} are {{a young black man}} and light-skinned woman courting, in the middle is a banjo player making music, where an adult woman dances with a child, as others look on. At the right edge, a young white woman in a refined white dress steps over a threshold from the house next door into this world, with another black figure behind her. (She is Johnson's sister.) An adult black woman looks out an upstairs window as she steadies a small light-skinned <b>child</b> <b>sitting</b> on the partially collapsed roof. The woman dancing with the child in the middle foreground has the darkest skin; nearly each individual is painted with a different skin tone.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{packaging}} {{was designed}} by Camouflage Productions partners Tom Wilkes and Barry Feinstein, the same team responsible for All Things Must Pass, rock music's first boxed triple album. Along with Alan Pariser, both Wilkes and Feinstein had taken stills photographs at Madison Square Garden, at the soundcheck on 31 July and during the concerts the next day, the results filling the 64-page full-colour booklet accompanying the original album. Also used as the Concert for Bangladesh movie poster, the album-cover photograph – the [...] "haunting" [...] image of a malnourished young <b>child</b> <b>sitting</b> naked behind a wide, empty food bowl, author Bruce Spizer writes – was a still taken from news agency film footage and airbrushed extensively by Wilkes. Having created the provocative, headline-filled picture sleeve for Harrison's [...] "Bangla Desh" [...] single earlier in the year, Wilkes was keen to capture [...] "real human compassion" [...] in this cover and poster image.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} stages of the album's conception, Manson {{intended}} to use a picture of himself as a <b>child</b> <b>sitting</b> nude on a couch in the album's interior artwork. Though no genitalia is shown in the picture, and it was taken by his own parents with no vulgar intent, the label rejected the idea on the grounds that it could constitute as child pornography, so Manson instead created the clay sculpture present on the final cover artwork of the album. On the table on this sculpture, there are little models of The Beatles next to the lamp. The boy in the photograph on the back cover is Ramirez's half-brother Wes Brown. He's holding an ear-piercing needle rather than a syringe. Portrait of an American Family is notable for being the band's only studio album not to feature an image of Manson on the cover. However, Manson did eventually use a nude photo of himself as an adult for the inside flap photo for the CD single for [...] "Lunchbox" [...] but did not expose his genitals.|$|E
