After breaking into a Terran science vessel and reversing the neural conditioning from her training as a psionic agent, Kerrigan is able to sense the presence of the Protoss fleet commander Tassadar on <b>Char.</b> Tassadar diverts Kerrigan's attention long enough for his companion Zeratul to assassinate Zasz, one of the Zerg commanders, with psionic energies the Zerg are unfamiliar with. This causes a temporary mental link between Zeratul and the Overmind, who uses this momentary contact with Zeratul's memories to locate the Protoss homeworld Aiur. The Overmind immediately launches the bulk of the Zerg Swarm in an invasion, although Kerrigan remains behind on <b>Char</b> to hunt down Tassadar and Zeratul.|$|E

Valerian, intending to show himself as a worthy successor to his father, asks Raynor to help him invade <b>Char</b> and use the artifact to restore Kerrigan's humanity, thus weakening the Zerg. To the initial dismay of the crew, Raynor agrees. With Valerian's aid, Raynor recovers the final artifact piece, and the Raiders and Dominion invade <b>Char.</b> The Dominion fleet is devastated by the heavy Zerg defenses, but Raynor secures a foothold on <b>Char</b> and rendezvouses with Dominion forces led by Horace Warfield, a decorated Dominion general.

In Brood War, DuGalle leads the UED as it conquers the Terran Dominion; however, despite his experience, DuGalle believes misinformation planted by former Confederate soldier Samir Duran regarding a psi disruptor, a device that disrupts Zerg communications, on Tarsonis. When DuGalle's lifelong friend Alexei Stukov abandons the fleet, DuGalle allows Duran to assassinate Stukov as a traitor, only realizing his mistake too late. Nevertheless, DuGalle acts to prevent Duran destroying the psi disruptor and uses it to capture the Zerg Overmind on <b>Char.</b> However, {{as a result of}} demoralization, limited manpower and an alliance of enemies led by Kerrigan, the fleet is eventually pushed back and when a final attempt to recapture <b>Char</b> fails, DuGalle orders the retreat.

40|$|In sub-Saharan Africa a {{large share}} of the energy use utilize biomass as a fuel. In some {{countries}} more than 90 percent of the energy use is biomass. This energy is primarily used for cooking, heating and drying. Cooking food on an open fire or using a traditional stove will combust the firewood inefficiently and leads to pollution in the form of particulate matter, carbon monoxide and other hazardous pollutants. Indoor pollution has serious health effects and especially women and children are affected by this since they spend more time in the kitchens compared to men. More efficient combustion would lead to less harmful pollution to women and children in these rural areas. There are different kinds of stoves on the market {{and one of them is}} the gasifier stove which allows the biomass to go through pyrolysis in a separate step before complete combustion. If the <b>charred</b> biomass is harvested before complete combustion it can be saved for later use. This stove will result in cleaner and more energy efficient combustion compared to the traditional 3 -stone-fire. The aim of this study has been to evaluate the <b>charred</b> biomass harvested from this gasifier stove in terms of energy use efficiency, emissions and cooking time. The <b>charred</b> biomass was compared to conventional charcoal bought at the local market. The <b>charred</b> biomass investigated is <b>charred</b> Grevillea prunings from the Grevillea Robusta tree, <b>charred</b> coconut husks (Cocos nucifera) and <b>charred</b> maize cobs (Zea mays). They were tested by cooking a meal consisting of two dishes at five different households for different kinds of <b>charred</b> biomass and conventional charcoal as a reference. Using <b>charred</b> Grevillea prunings gives an energy saving up to 31 percent while <b>charred</b> coconut husks gives up to 11 percent energy saved compared to the 3 -stone-fire. <b>Charred</b> maize cobs was only up to 2 percent more energy efficient than conventional charcoal due to its low energy density and fast burning rate. In most cases there was no significant difference between the emissions of the different <b>charred</b> fuel types. Only <b>charred</b> maize cobs resulted in significantly higher emissions than the other fuels. Household B deviated from the others households and had higher emissions. In conclusion the different types of <b>charred</b> biomass are good fuels for cooking. <b>Charred</b> maize cobs are less valuable since they require a higher rate of refilling of fuel during cooking and do not result in better energy use efficiency compared to conventional charcoal. There were no significant differences between the different types of <b>charred</b> biomass and conventional charcoal in emissions except for a few cases where <b>charred</b> maize cobs had a slightly higher level of emission compared to the others. CO 2 - levels were so low that there was no risk of harmful concentrations in any way.

40|$|The <b>charring</b> {{of organic}} {{materials}} during carbon analysis bythermal methods {{makes it difficult}} to differentiate elemental carbon (EC) from organic carbon (OC). Failure to correct for <b>charring</b> results in the overestimation of EC and the underestimation of OC. The <b>charring</b> characteristics and thermal behaviors of aerosol OC are studied by subjecting hexane and water extracts of ambient aerosols to various analysis conditions. The complete evolution of water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) aerosol materials is found to require a temperature as high as 850 degreesC and the presence of oxygen. EC would be oxidized under these thermal conditions as well. As a result, thermal methods relying only on temperature for the differentiation of EC and OC would give unreliable OC and EC concentrations. Our investigation also reveals that WSOC accounts for a large fraction (13 - 66 %) of <b>charring,</b> while hexane extractable organic compounds produce little <b>charring.</b> The extent of <b>charring</b> from WSOC, defined as the ratio between pyrolytically generated EC to the total WSOC, is found to increase with the WSOC loading in each analysis when the loadings are below a certain value, This ratio remains constant when the loadings are above this value. This may account for the high variability in the extent of <b>charring</b> among aerosol samples from different locations as well as among samples from a single location collected at different times. <b>Charring</b> is reduced if the residence time at each temperature step in a helium atmosphere is sufficiently long to allow for maximum C evolution at each step. <b>Charring</b> is also influenced by the presence of inorganic constituents such as ammonium bisulfate.

She presents herself on the Protoss colony world Shakuras, where she informs Zeratul and the Protoss of a new Overmind growing on <b>Char,</b> manipulating them into destroying Zerg forces running rival to her goals. She also gains an ally in an apparently infested Samir Duran, who infiltrates the newly arrived forces of the United Earth Directorate (UED) and attempts to sabotage their mission to enslave the Zerg and seize control of the sector of the galaxy. However, the UED is successful in capturing the new Overmind, and Kerrigan exploits the threat of the UED to forge an alliance with Mengsk, Raynor and his new Protoss allies, turning around the war against the UED. However, Kerrigan quickly betrays this alliance and strikes at the armies of Raynor and Mengsk, heavily damaging both groups. Accompanied by Duran, Kerrigan returns to Shakuras to abduct the Protoss leader Raszagal, using her to blackmail Zeratul into killing the new Overmind on <b>Char,</b> after which all Zerg fall under Kerrigan's control—around this time, she begins her self-proclamation as the Queen of Blades.
