Generalized association {{rules are}} based on multiple-level concepts, but it is usually difficult to build such taxonomy.

In order to deal with a large number of transactions and ontology, we make use of Genetic Network Programming (GNP) to efficiently mine enough rules. Genetic Network Programming is an evolutionary computation method with directed graphs as genes, and could be applied to many areas due to its compact structure. We also present three kinds of node chains in GNP: Sequentially <b>Connected</b> <b>Chain</b> (SCC), Sequentially <b>Connected</b> <b>Chain</b> with One Loop (SCC-OL), and Randomly <b>Connected</b> <b>Chain</b> (RCC).

The first part of a bullock’s education began when the bullocky tied two young bullocks together with two heavy leather collars and a <b>connecting</b> <b>chain.</b> Thus connected they were turned out to graze and rest until they accepted the close presence of their partner. Untrained bullocks were then put in the centre of the team, where they were more easily controlled with the assistance and guidance of the [...] "leaders” who were well trained to verbal commands. Pairs of bullocks were matched for size and yoked together using a wooden yoke secured to each bullock by a metal bow which was fixed in place by key on top of the yoke. Each pair was connected by a special chain, which ran from a central ring on each yoke to the next pair, thus coupling the team in tandem fashion. The “wheelers” or “polers” were the older, heavier, trained bullocks which were closest to the dray or jinker and helped to slow the load when necessary. Thus then was the team attached to the dray or jinker.|$|E

40|$|Explaining {{underlying}} causes or effects about events is a challenging but valuable task. We define a novel problem of generating explanations {{of a time}} series event by (1) searching cause and effect relationships of the time series with textual data and (2) constructing a <b>connecting</b> <b>chain</b> between them to generate an explanation. To detect causal features from text, we propose a novel method based on the Granger causality of time series between features extracted from text such as N-grams, topics, sentiments, and their composition. The generation of the sequence of causal entities requires a commonsense causative knowledge base with efficient reasoning. To ensure good interpretability and appropriate lexical usage we combine symbolic and neural representations, using a neural reasoning algorithm trained on commonsense causal tuples to predict the next cause step. Our quantitative and human analysis show empirical evidence that our method successfully extracts meaningful causality relationships between time series with textual features and generates appropriate explanation between them.

40|$|A {{number of}} new 4 -phenylpiperidine- 2, 6 -diones bearing at the 1 -position an ω-[4 -(substituted phenyl) piperazin- 1 -yl]alkyl moiety were {{designed}} and synthesized as ligands for the α 1 -adrenergic receptor (α 1 -AR) subtypes. Some synthesized compounds, tested in binding assays for the human cloned α 1 A-, α 1 B-, and α 1 D-AR subtypes, displayed affinities in the nanomolar range. Highest affinity values were found in derivatives having a butyl <b>connecting</b> <b>chain</b> between the 4 -phenylpiperidine- 2, 6 -dione and the phenylpiperazinyl moieties. 1 -[4 -[4 -(2 -Methoxyphenyl) piperazin- 1 -yl]butyl]- 4 -phenylpiperidine- 2, 6 - dione (34) showed the best affinity for the α 1 A-AR (pK i = 8. 74) and 10 -fold selectivity {{compared to the other}} two α 1 -AR subtypes. Some representative compounds were also tested in order to evaluate their effects on the signal transduction pathway coupled to α 1 -AR subtypes. They all blocked norepinephrine-induced stimulation of inositol phospholipid hydrolysis, thus behaving as antagonists. Binding data were used to refine a previously developed pharmacophoric model for α 1 D-ARs. The revised model shows a highly predictive power and could be useful for the future design of high affinity α 1 D-AR ligands. © 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{investigated}} {{the mechanism of}} enzyme immobilization on silanized surfaces through coupling agents (cross-linkers) {{in order to understand}} the role of these molecules on interfacial processes and their effect on catalytic activity. To this end, we used a model multimeric enzyme (G 6 PDH) and several cross-linking molecules with different chemical properties, including the nature of the end-group (-NCO, -NCS, -CHO), the <b>connecting</b> <b>chain</b> (aliphatic vs aromatic), and geometrical constraints (meta vs para-disubstituted aromatics). There did not seem to be radical differences in the mechanism of enzyme adsorption according to the linker used as judged from QCM-D, except that in the case of DIC (1, 4 -phenylene diisocyanate) the adsorption occurred more rapidly. In contrast, the nature of the cross-linker exerted a strong influence on the amount of enzyme immobilized as estimated from XPS, and more unexpectedly on the stability of the underlying silane layer. DIC, PDC (1, 4 -phenylene diisothiocyanate), or GA (glutaraldehyde) allowed successful enzyme immobilization. When the geometry of the linker was changed from 1, 4 -phenylene diisothiocyanate to 1, 3 -phenylene diisothiocyanate (MDC), the silane layer was subjected to degradation, upon enzyme adsorption, and the amount of immobilized molecules was significantly lowered. TE (terephtalaldehyde) and direct enzyme deposition without cross-linker were similar to MDC. The organization of immobilized enzymes also depended on the immobilization procedure, as different degrees of aggregation were observed by AFM. A correlation between the size of the aggregates and the catalytic properties of the enzyme was established, suggesting that aggregation may enhance the thermostability of the multimeric enzyme, probably through a compaction of the 3 D structure...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} heterocyclic {{compounds}} {{have been used}} to quench the fluorescence from aromatic hydrocarbons in fluid solution and, in some cases, exciplex emission has been observed. A consideration of solvent effects and the redox potentials of the electron donor and acceptor molecules indicate that the quenching process involves excited state charge transfer interactions. The fluorescence spectra of several monofunctional and bifunctional compounds (aromatic hydrocarbons and amines) have been recorded and fluorescent excimer formation has been observed in some cases. Excimer formation is most efficient when 3 atoms connect the interacting groups. The fluorescence from several aromatic hydrocarbons {{has been found to be}} very efficiently quenched by bifunctional compounds such as a,w-diaminoalkanes. When the alkyl chain connecting the terminal amino groups contains less than 5 methylene groups then the quenching process involves both amino groups in the formation of a termolecular complex [...] -in these cases, exciplex emission is relatively inefficient. Exterplex emission has been observed in some cases. The increased quenching efficiency obtained when diamines with 5 or more methylene groups in the <b>connecting</b> <b>chain</b> are used as quenchers is due to multi-collisional quenching rather than exterplex formation. The quenching of the fluorescence from dyes such as Rose Bengal by diaminoalkanes, a,w-dinaphthyl alkanes and related compounds appears to be due to the multi-collisional quenching process rather than exterplex formation. Molecules such as N-n-butyl-N,N-di-(2 -naphthylmethyl) -amine and N-phenyl-(2, 5 -dimethyl) pyrrole, when excited, have more than one possible emitting species depending on the orientation of the interacting groups [...] -one being more polar than the other.
