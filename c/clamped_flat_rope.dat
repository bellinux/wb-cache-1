40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the problem of sound {{radiation}} by two concentric <b>clamped</b> <b>flat</b> plates, circular and annular, into the half-space. The system of three coupled differential equations comprising two equations of motions of plates and the wave equation, is solved exactly. Vibrations of plates are axisymmetric and time-harmonic with a single excitation frequency. The initial phase difference of excitations can be nonzero. Attenuation due to fluid loading and material damping is included. Kirchoff-Love and Kelvin-Voigt theories are applied. The effect of initial phase difference of excitations on the acoustic power radiated is examined as well as errors resulting from neglecting the fluid loading...|$|R

40|$|A modal basis {{selection}} technique for a reduced-order nonlinear numerical simulation with application to two-dimensional structures {{is presented as}} a two-step procedure. A system identification analysis is first performed using proper orthogonal decomposition. Using these results, a set of load-invariant bases consisting of the normal modes is next selected. Two criteria for making the basis selection are offered; one using the modal assurance criterion and the other using the modal expansion theorem. The quality of the subsequent reduced-order analyses are examined through comparison with computationally intensive finite element nonlinear simulations in physical degrees-of-freedom. A <b>clamped</b> <b>flat</b> isotropic plate under a random acoustic loading is considered to demonstrate the procedure. It is found that the subject procedure enables formation of an accurate and computationally efficient reduced-order system applicable to a broad range of loading conditions...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} a transparent WDM ring network design immune to accumulated power transients where simultaneous bidirectional operation is achieved {{on a single}} fiber. This allows cost effectiveness, flexible traffic re-routing, and network operation. We demonstrate that add/drop of 15 out of 16 channels gen- erate negligible (< 0. 15 dB) power excursion on the surviving channel. These results have been obtained by using new high-gain erbium-doped waveguide amplifiers in an innovative gain-clamped configuration that allows bidirectional operation. The glass-on-sil- icon waveguide optical amplifiers are able to achieve a <b>clamped</b> <b>flat</b> gain of 15 dB on full C-band with up to 0 -dBm input power. This is the highest output power ever reported for an erbium-doped waveguide amplifier.

40|$|Capacitive (condenser) MEMS {{microphones}} {{have been}} developed using various design and fabrication techniques to improve performance. Mechanical sensitivity of a condenser MEMS microphone can be increased by reducing the residual stress of the diaphragm using several design approaches including corrugated diaphragms, and in recent years, various spring type diaphragms. The electrical sensitivity of the condenser microphone {{is proportional to the}} deflection of the diaphragm, however, the parabolic deflection of the diaphragm, and thus its effective diaphragm area, has reduced the sensitivity of parallel plate type capacitor on a condenser MEMS microphone. This paper presents the numerical analysis on the effective diaphragm area of several condenser MEMS microphone designs of 1. 1 mm x 1. 1 mm square. The analysis shows that the effective area of a spring-supported diaphragm is about 20 % higher, and its capacitance value thus electrical sensitivity, is about 170 % higher than a fully <b>clamped</b> <b>flat</b> diaphragm of an equal size. In addition, a flat deflection and higher effective diaphragm area of a spring-supported diaphragm can be achieved by carefully designed spring mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Capacitive {{microphones}} (condenser microphones) work on {{a principle}} of variable capacitance and voltage by the movement of its electrically charged diaphragm and back plate in response to sound pressure. There has been considerable research carried out to increase the sensing performance of microphones while reducing their size to cater for various modern applications such as mobile communication and hearing aid devices. This paper reviews the development and current performance of several condenser MEMS microphone designs, and introduces a microphone with spring supported diaphragm to further improve condenser microphone performance. The numerical analysis using Coventor FEM software shows that this new microphone design has a higher mechanical sensitivity compared to the existing edge <b>clamped</b> <b>flat</b> diaphragm condenser MEMS microphone. The spring supported diaphragm is shown to have a flat frequency response up to 7 kHz and more stable under the variations of the diaphragm residual stress. The microphone {{is designed to be}} easily fabricated using the existing silicon fabrication technology and the stability against the residual stress increases its reproducibility...|$|R
5000|$|On 12 December 1884, {{five men}} descended the No.2 South shaft in a bowk to replace some byats. Just after the winding engine commenced, the [...] wide braided steel <b>flat</b> <b>rope</b> broke, sending four {{to their deaths}} {{at the bottom of}} the shaft [...] below. Thomas John Dobbs, who had been guiding the bowk down a guide rope, managed to slowly lowered himself to within hailing {{distance}} of pit bottom, and was rescued with nothing more than cuts and bruises. Following an accident investigation by HM Inspectorate of Mines, it was found that the rope had corroded, where it had been in contact with the Headframe sheave wheel. But as the rope was covered with a protective coating of tar, the corrosion had gone undetected. The sheave wheels on both the No.1 and No.2 shafts at Deep Navigation were unusual, in that they were constructed of different parts that had been riveted together, not a singular wheel that had been cast. The sheaves were not replaced at Deep Navigation until 1961 (No.2 South), and 1963 (No.1 North).|$|R

40|$|The {{weighted}} sum of spatial gradients (WSSG) control minimization parameter is developed {{for use in}} active structural acoustic control (ASAC) on a <b>clamped</b> <b>flat</b> rectangular plate. The WSSG minimization parameter is measured using four accelerometers grouped closely together on the test structure. In previous work, WSSG was developed on a simply supported flat rectangular plate and showed promise as a control metric. The displacement on the clamped plate has been modeled using an approximate analytical solution assuming shape functions corresponding to clamped-clamped beams. From the analytical formulation, weights, which {{were found to be}} the reciprocal of the wave number squared, have been derived to produce a uniform WSSG field across the plate. In active control simulations, this quantity has been shown to provide better global control of acoustic radiation than volume velocity. Analysis is presented which shows that comparable control, regardless of the sensor location, can be achieved using WSSG. Experimental results are presented which demonstrate that WSSG works effectively in practice, with results similar to the simulations. The results show that minimization of WSSG can be used as an effective control objective on clamped rectangular plates to achieve attenuation of acoustic radiation...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} experimental studies on different active vibration control (AVC) sys-tems concepts for <b>clamped</b> <b>flat</b> plates using Hinf-feedback controller. For a comparative performance evaluation of different control strategies {{in terms of}} global vibration reduction and system complexity, a generic set-up is used. The placement of piezoelectric actuators and different types of sensors (accelerometer, piezoelectric patch sensors) is performed with regard to controllability and observability criteria. In addition to the common multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) model from all actuators to all sensors a so called generalized plant with extended number of performance outputs is used to design a Hinf-controller. The extended number of performance outputs is generated by offline laser scanning vibrome-ter (LSV) measurements using a fine grid of LSV scan points. To evaluate the different control performances {{in comparison to the}} system complexity the number of transducers is varied. To identify the key trends more than 100 centralized and decentralized control-lers are studied experimentally and the global vibration reduction is quantified using LSV measurements. For systems with a higher complexity, it can be shown that the use of an extended generalized plant can significantly improve global vibration attenuation. Further, it can be observed that mixed sensor configurations lead to an improved broadband per-formance. The final evaluation is based on criteria such as controller performance, stabil-ity, modularity and system complexity...|$|R

5000|$|... 'Boat {{building}} uses many or {{the same}} tools that are common house tools such as hammers, cross cut saws, power drills, benches and vices. For building small boats under 5m some specialized tools are needed such as clamps (cramps) either G clamps or spring clamps. A minimum of 4 6inch(150mm) and 10 4inch(100mm) G clamps, plus 20 2 inch(50mm) steel spring clamps is need for ply on frame designs. More is better with <b>clamps.</b> <b>Flat</b> and round surform rasps are useful tools for shaping wood and ply. A drill set from 2-10mm, several speedbore drills for larger holes 12-25mm, (1/2inch-1 inch) rotary sanding backing pads {{and a range of}} replacement sanding pads from coarse (40grit) to fine (180grit), counter sinking drills for screws, a right angle set square, a set of manual screw drivers with blades to match screws being used are essential. A heavy craft knife, an 8m(25 ft) tape, flat and round files for metal and wood, a short(torpedo) level and a set of 3 chisels from 6 to 25mm are needed. Power tools make a job much easier and are relatively cheap. An 7 1/4inch (185mm) circular saw with a fine 40 tooth tungsten carbide blade, a jigsaw with a dust blower with a set of fine, medium and coarse tooth metal and wood blades is good for cutting plywood panels to shape, a rotary oscillating sander with medium and fine pads and a cordless drill for driving screws all save time and energy. A steam box is excellent for making planks easier to bend although hot wet rags are a messy, but easy substitute. A fine tooth hacksaw is not only essential for cutting metal such as trimming stainless steel bolts to the correct length but is handy for ultra-fine cuts in thin wood. A fine-tooth tenon saw is used to cut across the grain to produce a reasonably fine, accurate cut. Some boat builders have started using Japanese draw saws for fine cuts but while these are excellent they tend to be very expensive. A No 4 smoothing plane is essential but an electric plane is very useful (but extremely loud) for making rudder blades and centre boards. A much longer No. 7 plane is needed if the design calls for a wooden spars as used in many modern [...] "traditional" [...] yachts.|$|R

Despite the wide application of V-band clamps, their behaviour is not fully understood and the ultimate axial strength is currently only available from physical testing. This physical testing has indicated that the ultimate strength is determined by {{two different types of}} structural deformation, an elastic deformation mode and a plastic deformation mode. Initial finite element analysis work has demonstrated that analysis of this class of problem is not straightforward.

25|$|An {{alternative}} {{which is}} growing in practice {{is the use of}} a hollow piercing needle, as is done in body piercing. The piercer disinfects the earlobe with alcohol and puts a mark on the lobe with a pen. It gives the opportunity to the client to check whether the position is correct or not. Then, the piercer uses a <b>clamp</b> with <b>flat</b> ends and holes at the end to hold the earlobe, with the dot {{in the middle of the}} holes. This device will support the skin during the piercing process. A cork can be placed behind the earlobe to stop the movement of the needle after the piercing process, and protect the tip of the needle for the client's comfort. Then, the piercer places the hollow needle perpendicular to the skin's surface and check the position of the needle, to pierce at the desired place and the right angle. The piercing process consists of pushing the needle through the earlobe, until it gets out in the other side. The client has to remain still during all the process. Then, the clamp can be put off. After that, the piercer puts the jewel in the hollow needle and pushes the needle through until the jewel enters into the lobe. Then, the needle is removed and disposed properly. The jewel is attached to the lobe and the piercer disinfects the lobe again.|$|R
50|$|On 11 August actual {{construction}} began; on 16 August Tritton {{decided to}} fit a wheeled tail to assist in steering. On 9 September the Number 1 Lincoln Machine, as the prototype was then known, made its first test run in the yard of the Wellington Foundry. It {{soon became clear that}} the track profiles were so flat that ground resistance during a turn was excessive. To solve this, the suspension was changed so that the bottom profile was more curved. Then the next problem showed up: when crossing a trench the track sagged and then would not fit the wheels again and jammed. The tracks were also not up to carrying the weight of the vehicle (about 16 tons). Tritton and Lieutenant Walter Gordon Wilson tried several types of alternative track design, including balatá belting and <b>flat</b> wire <b>ropes.</b> Tritton, on 22 September, devised a robust but outwardly crude system using pressed steel plates riveted to cast links and incorporated guides to engage {{on the inside of the}} track frame. The track frames as a whole were connected to the main body by large spindles. This system was unsprung, as the tracks were held firmly in place, able to move in only one plane. This was a successful design and was used on all First World War British tanks up to the Mark VIII, although it limited speed.|$|R
40|$|It is {{suitable}} to reduce thickness of circular saw {{when trying to}} enhance usability of wood raw material, but reducing thickness also causes reduction of permissible rotational speed which reduces sawing speed. If one increase circular saw rotational speed over permissible one the quality of machined surfaces will reduce because of enhanced vibrations. Permissible rotational speed can be calculated from critical rotational speed which can be defined from natural frequencies of the saw. In this article critical rotational speeds of standard <b>clamped</b> saws (with <b>flat</b> disk surface and without slots) are calculated by using finite element method and classical theory of thin plates on annular plates. Mode shapes and natural frequencies of annular plates are determined by using Bessel functions and by using polynomial functions. Obtained results suggest that standard clamped circular saws without slots and with relatively small teeth can be determined from classical theory of thin plates for annular plates with accuracy depending on clamping ratio...|$|R

Slip displacement between the specimen and pad was measured remotely using an LVDT and locally using digital image correlation. The latter approach allowed accurate determination of the tangential contact stiffness from frictional hysteresis loops. The results obtained show that the contacts are significantly less stiff than would be predicted by a smooth elastic contact analysis.

40|$|The {{tangential}} {{contact stiffness}} of frictional interfaces affects both the vibration response and structural integrity of structures comprising frictional joints. Vibration and structural response of monolithic structures can be predicted very accurately; however, when assemblies of components involve frictional interfaces, additional damping and compliance are present due to these interfaces. These features {{make it more}} challenging to predict the vibration characteristics of assemblies with {{the same degree of}} accuracy as can be achieved for single components. If these interface properties can be determined, it should then be possible to significantly enhance current models of the vibration of engineering assemblies. Measurements of both force and displacement in the tangential direction are obtained from a series of in-line fretting tests involving flat pads with rounded corners <b>clamped</b> against the <b>flat</b> surface of a specimen which is oscillated by a hydraulic tensile testing machine. In order to measure the local displacement field very close to the contact interface, the digital image correlation (DIC) method is employed.

5000|$|The clover clamp, also {{referred}} to as a [...] "butterfly clamp", is of Japanese design and provides increasing tension if pulled. The <b>clamp</b> itself is <b>flat,</b> about 5 cm by 10 cm (2 by 4 in) in size. The clamp is applied to the nipple and the spring tension holds the clamp in place. The clamp usually provides a very high pain level, and is usually only used by more advanced users. To increase tension on the nipples, small weights such as fishing line sinkers can be attached {{to the ends of the}} clamp. As increased pulling tension is applied to the clamp, it will cause the jaws of the clamp to close tighter, depending on the amount of pull pressure. Another method is to use the clamps to keep a person in one place. If cord is tied from the clamp to a fixed place, the wearer of the clamps cannot move away because the clamps will tighten as they move. Eventually the clamps would be pulled off the nipples but not before considerable pain is felt. If left on for too long can cause nipple irritation.|$|R
40|$|The variable-pressure washer (VPW) is a {{proposed}} device {{that is so}} named because (1) it would play the role similar to that played by an ordinary washer, except that (2) the clamping pressure applied by it would vary with either circumferential or radial position. In a typical contemplated application, the radially varying clamping pressure {{would be used to}} obtain more nearly uniform compression on a pair of concentric seals (e. g., an O-ring or a gasket) in an assembly that experiences larger deformations normal to the sealing surface for locations around the outer diameter of the attachment flange when compared to locations around the inner diameter. The VPW (see figure) would include two interlocking channel rings pushed axially away from each other by compression spring-like components located at two or more radial positions. Each spring would have a different stiffness based on the radial location. Overlapping splits in each interlocking channel ring would allow for the non-uniform deformation in the rings. Each spring would be held in place by retaining cups attached to the inner flat surfaces of the channel rings. A plunger attached to one channel ring on the central axis would be captured in a plunger housing attached to the other channel ring: The capture of the plunger would hold the VPW together. When the VPW was <b>clamped</b> between two <b>flat</b> surfaces, the <b>clamping</b> force would be distributed unevenly across the face of the washer in the radial direction. The different stiffnesses of the springs would be chosen, in conjunction with other design parameters, to obtain a specified radial variation of clamping pressure {{in the presence of a}} specified clamping force...|$|R

Three buildings containing seventeen flats in total were monitored {{during a period of}} over two years, monitoring energy consumption and internal temperature of the flats. The energy consumption for the flats was capture by the use of a Current Cost smart meter placed at the ground floor of each block of flats in a cover under stairs. Wireless sensors were <b>clamped</b> to each <b>flat.</b> The smart meters were not connected to the internet or a computer, but instead the data was stored in the internal memory of the equipment and manually downloaded to a computer at each data collection visit. For the purpose of double checking, meter readings were collected at the electricity meter to be able to compared the accuracy and success of the data collected by the Current Cost smart meters. The internal temperature of every flat was collected by mean of a LogTag temperature data. From comparing the Current Cost smart meter data versus the utility meter readings a huge range of overestimation and underestimation of the actual energy consumption was observed. Regarding the internal temperature monitoring, long periods of lost data was identified. The main factors contributing to these data lost were: Long periods between data collection, wireless signal drop offs, unplugging, tampering and removal of equipment. A normalized energy index, based on utility meter readings, internal temperature and outdoor conditions, was developed to overcome the loss of data and assess the effectiveness of the technology and the behavioral change in the occupants. The normalised energy index provides a methodology to evaluate technology and behavioural changes effect between flats and across seasons...|$|R
