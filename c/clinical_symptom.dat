50|$|Dinophysis acuta is {{a species}} of flagellated planktons {{belonging}} to the genus Dinophysis. It {{is one of the}} few unusual photosynthetic protists that acquire plastids from algae by endosymbiosis. By forming massive blooms, particularly in late summer and spring, it causes red tides. It produces toxic substances and the red tides cause widespread infection of seafood, particularly crabs and mussels. When infected animals are consumed, severe diarrhoea occurs. The <b>clinical</b> <b>symptom</b> is called diarrhetic shellfish poisoning. The main chemical toxins were identified in 2006 as okadaic acid and pectenotoxins. They can produce non-fatal or fatal amounts of toxins in their predators, which can become toxic to humans.|$|E
5000|$|Reinke's edema is {{characterized}} by a [...] "sac-like" [...] appearance of the vocal folds. [...] The edema is a white translucent fluid that causes a bulging (distension) of the vocal cord. The most common <b>clinical</b> <b>symptom</b> associated with Reinke's edema is an abnormally low pitched voice with hoarseness. The low pitch voice {{is a direct result of}} increased fluid in the Reinke's space, which vibrates at a lower frequency than normal (females <130 Hz; males <110 Hz). [...] Hoarseness is a common problem of many laryngeal diseases, such as laryngitis. It is described as a harsh and breathy tone of voice. Hoarseness is often seen alongside dysphonia, a condition in which the individual has difficulty speaking.|$|E
50|$|According {{to his son}} Gangaabaatar, {{during the}} last few months of his life, Dashbalbar began {{complaining}} that he was being poisoned by state-sanctioned officials. However some people believed that Dashbalbar was showing a <b>clinical</b> <b>symptom</b> of schizophrenia. On October 16, 1999, Dashbalbar was admitted to hospital, and eventually died later that night. The medical situation in Mongolia at that time made it impossible for a full post mortem to be carried out, and so the true cause of his death remains unknown. It seems that the public continues to believe that he had, like Zorig almost exactly a year before, been murdered, primarily because of his opposition to government corruption, but also, one might imagine, because of his national popularity.|$|E

50|$|Clinical ostertagiosis {{normally}} {{occurs in}} first grazing season calves but can affect mature animals. Subclinical infection results in reduced weight gain and growth rate, reduced reproductive efficiency and reduced milk production. The primary <b>clinical</b> <b>symptom</b> of fulminant bovine ostertagiosis is watery diarrhoea {{and is usually}} accompanied by reduced appetite and anorexia. Infected animals are characterised by dull, rough coats and hindquarters soiled with faeces {{as a result of}} the profuse diarrhoea. Cattle are frequently co-infected with many gastrointestinal nematodes including species of the following genera: Ostertagia, Haemonchus, Bunostomum, Oesophagostomum, Trichuris, Trichostrongylus, Cooperia, and Nematodirus. The clinical signs between these species of nematodes are difficult to distinguish from each other, and are often referred to as a syndrome called parasitic gastroenteritis. Clinical ostertagiosis can be observed under two sets of circumstances referred to as type I and type II disease.|$|E
50|$|The {{clinical}} {{manifestations of}} absence seizures vary significantly among patients. Impairment of consciousness {{is the essential}} symptom, and {{may be the only}} <b>clinical</b> <b>symptom,</b> but this can be combined with other manifestations. The hallmark of the absence seizures is abrupt and sudden-onset impairment of consciousness, interruption of ongoing activities, a blank stare, possibly a brief upward rotation of the eyes. If the patient is speaking, speech is slowed or interrupted; if walking, they stand transfixed; if eating, the food will stop {{on its way to the}} mouth. Usually, the patient will be unresponsive when addressed. In some cases, attacks are aborted when the patient is called. The attack lasts from a few seconds to half a minute, and evaporates as rapidly as it commenced. Absence seizures generally are not followed by a period of disorientation or lethargy (post-ictal state), in contrast to the majority of seizure disorders.|$|E
5000|$|The {{presence}} of parkinsonism as a <b>clinical</b> <b>symptom</b> of CBD is {{largely responsible for}} complications in developing unique diagnostic criteria for the disease. [...] Other such diseases in which parkinsonism forms an integral diagnostic characteristic are PD and PSP. Parkinsonism in CBD is largely present in an extremity such as the arm, and is always asymmetric. It {{has been suggested that}} non-dominant arm is involved more often. Common associated movement dysfunctions that comprise parkinsonism are rigidity, bradykinesia, and gait disorder, with limb rigidity forming the most typical manifestation of parkinsonism in CBD. Despite being relatively indistinct, this rigidity can lead to disturbances in gait and correlated movements. Bradykinesia in CBD occurs when there is notable slowing in the completion of certain movements in the limbs. In an associated study, it was determined that, three years following first diagnosis, 71% of persons with CBD demonstrate the {{presence of}} bradykinesia.|$|E

Seven (39 %) hygienic colonies developed <b>clinical</b> <b>symptoms</b> of the disease but five of these recovered (had no visible symptoms) leaving two colonies (11 %) with <b>clinical</b> <b>symptoms.</b> In contrast, 100 % of the non-hygienic colonies that were challenged developed <b>clinical</b> <b>symptoms,</b> and only one recovered.

40|$|Moslem {{pregnant}} women {{are inclined to}} fast {{during the month of}} Ramadan. Ketonuria and hypoglycemia are harmful in pregnancy. The aim {{of this study was to}} find out whether <b>clinical</b> <b>symptoms</b> and/ or calorie deficiency of fasting {{pregnant women}} before Eftar (ending of the daily fast) can accurately predict ketonuria and hypoglycemia. In a descriptive study, 185 volunteer fasting pregnant women in Ramadan of 1999 were tested just before Eftar taking into account their <b>clinical</b> <b>symptoms,</b> intake of the previous 24 hours and testing their ketonuria and serum glucose. The positive predictive values of <b>clinical</b> <b>symptoms</b> before breaking the fast for ketonuria and hypoglycemia were 32 % and 56 %, respectively. The negative predictive values of <b>clinical</b> <b>symptoms</b> for ketonuria and hypoglycemia were 70 % and 33 %. The positive predictive values of over 500 Kcal deficiency in ketonuria and hypoglycemia were 33 % and 57 %. Severe calorie deficiency (more than 2000 Kcal) positively predicts ketonuria in 70 % of cases and sufficient calorie intake (less than 500 Kcal deficiency) negatively predicts ketonuria in 93 % of women. <b>Clinical</b> <b>symptoms</b> and calorie intake were not appropriate criteria for predicting ketonuria and hypoglycemia except in asymptomatic or severely calorie deficient cases or those with sufficient calorie intake whose ketonuria was predicted accurately...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionGliomas of the {{cerebellum}} {{are rare}} in adults, and their {{natural history and}} clinical behavior are not well known. Because cerebellar glioma is not usually diagnosed until <b>clinical</b> <b>symptoms</b> have appeared, no reports have described the developmental process of new cerebellar gliomas. We describe a case of de novo cerebellar anaplastic astrocytoma in which the developmental process was detected on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Presentation of caseA 78 -year-old man {{with a history of}} cerebral infarction was undergoing follow-up MRI every 6 months. This follow-up revealed a small abnormality in the left cerebellar hemisphere without <b>clinical</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Subsequent MRI showed lesion growth accompanying <b>clinical</b> <b>symptoms.</b> As cerebellar tumor was suspected, the lesion was extirpated. The histological diagnosis was anaplastic astrocytoma. Local recurrence developed and the patient died 20 months postoperatively. DiscussionCerebellar gliomas sometimes do not exhibit the common MRI findings of supratentorial gliomas, leading to difficulty with preoperative diagnosis. In this case, we initially diagnosed asymptomatic cerebellar infarction because the lesion was small and asymptomatic. The abnormal lesion gradually grew and <b>clinical</b> <b>symptoms</b> appeared. Cerebellar glioma may show few signs characteristic of tumor on MRI in the initial stages. ConclusionWhen MRI detects a new, faint abnormality in the cerebellum, close follow-up of <b>clinical</b> <b>symptoms</b> and MRI on suspicion of glioma is warrante...|$|R
