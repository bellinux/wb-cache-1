It was apparent {{at that time that}} the largest <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>expertise</b> on diesel-hydraulic locomotives was in West Germany. The Western Region of British Railways negotiated a licence with German manufacturers to scale down the German Federal Railway's [...] "V200" [...] design to suit the smaller loading gauge of the British network, and to allow British manufacturers to construct the new locomotives. The resultant design bears a close resemblance, both cosmetically, and in the engineering employed, to the original V200 design. Warship locomotives were divided into two batches: those built at BR's Swindon works were numbered in the series D800 to D832 and from D866 to D870, had a maximum tractive effort of [...] and eventually became British Rail Class 42. 33 others, D833–865, were constructed by the North British Locomotive Company and became British Rail Class 43. They were allocated to Bristol Bath Road, Plymouth Laira, Newton Abbot and Old Oak Common.|$|E

30|$|Since {{the concept}} of TH was {{introduced}} two decades ago, it has gained a political breakthrough in Europe {{as well as in}} South-East Asia and Latin America (Strand 2016) as a collaborative means of stimulating innovation and value creation. Accordingly, good networking practice for knowledge-based economic development ought to include advice on identifying the right balance between business, research and government. In order to stimulate innovation in business, the Norwegian Government has initiated several measures directed towards business networks. One of these is the Norwegian Innovation Clusters programme (NIC). This programme finances clusters at different “levels”: Arena for immature clusters, Norwegian <b>Centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>Expertise</b> (NCE) for mature clusters with a national position and Global <b>Centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>Expertise</b> (GCE) for mature clusters with a global position. The programme is funded by Innovation Norway, SIVA and the Research Council of Norway. NIC aims to trigger and reinforce collaborative development activities within clusters, thus increasing the clusters’ dynamics and attractiveness and raising levels of innovation and competitiveness within the individual companies involved.|$|R

On the eve of those efforts this article reports the findings of an effort to map and assess fluorine research in South Africa in comparison to four other countries i. e. Malaysia, Australia, Germany and Italy. The results of the assessment are aimed at guiding future directions for fluorine research in the country, at identifying <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>expertise</b> nationally where new research chairs could be established, at identifying international <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>expertise</b> to be utilised for collaboration and of course for inter-temporal benchmarking of fluorine research in South Africa. South Africa is identified to be producing a small number of fluorine research publications in comparison to other countries like Germany and Italy which produce orders of magnitude larger number of publications and in comparison to country’s total research effort. Furthermore the relevant research effort appears to be dispersed geographically and in disciplinary terms. Relevant recommendations are provided with particular emphasis on the pluralistic science policy approach followed in the country...|$|R
