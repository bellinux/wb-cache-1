However, again because of large crowds during the days of Hajj, they may instead pray anywhere in the mosque.

5|$|The E-1 variant with Jumo 211A-1 engines was {{developed}} in 1937, the He 111 V6 being the first production variant. The E-1 had its original powerplant, the DB 600 replaced with the Jumo 210 Ga engines. The more powerful Jumo 211 A-1 engines desired by the Ministry of Aviation were not yet ready for installation. Another trial aircraft, He 111 V10 (D-ALEQ) was to be fitted with two oil <b>coolers</b> necessary for the Jumo 211 A-1 installation.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature that}} {{was ahead of}} its time was the use of dynamic brakes, where some (or most) of the braking effect is created by running the {{traction}} motors in reverse as generators, and then dissipating the generated electrical power in resistors to produce heat. In this case, the heat was generated in the locomotive as opposed to the more typically roof-top open-air <b>coolers</b> seen on most modern locomotives. The resistors were themselves cooled by the water from the steam loop, heating it. This allowed the braking energy to be recuperated, or as it is more typically known, offered regenerative braking.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after peaking in intensity, Darby {{moved over}} <b>coolers</b> waters {{and began to}} deteriorate. The eye became less {{well-defined}} and the associated convection started weakening. Increasingly colder waters and growing wind shear continued to affect Darby, and the cyclone weakened to a tropical storm on July 30. The low-level center of circulation became exposed from the thunderstorm activity, and the storm quickly degenerated into a swirl of clouds, although it maintained tropical storm strength. On July 31, it weakened to a tropical depression. Darby soon crossed into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, and it dissipated as a tropical cyclone on August 1. However, its remnants continued westward under the low-level trade winds, and dropped heavy rainfall on Hawaii several days after the cyclone dissipated.|$|E

5|$|Some {{non-standard}} USB devices use the 5V {{power supply}} without {{participating in a}} proper USB network, which negotiates power draw with the host interface. These are usually called USB decorations. Examples include USB-powered keyboard lights, fans, mug <b>coolers</b> and heaters, battery chargers, miniature vacuum cleaners, and even miniature lava lamps. In most cases, these items contain no digital circuitry, and thus are not standard-compliant USB devices. This may cause problems with some computers, such as drawing too much current and damaging circuitry. Prior to the USB Battery Charging Specification, the USB specification required that devices connect in a low-power mode (100mA maximum) and communicate their current requirements to the host, which then permits the device to switch into high-power mode.|$|E
5|$|The women {{worked from}} 8:30a.m. to 3:30p.m. daily – not long hours – but the working {{conditions}} were probably unbearable by modern standards. New Orleans has a warm, wet climate. The process of adjusting, however, required the utmost {{attention to the}} scales' balance, and the slightest draft could upset it. The draft could also carry off the silver dust from the coin planchets the women would file. For these reasons the windows and doors were almost always kept shut, resulting in a very hot working environment. Workers relied on water <b>coolers</b> to provide relief {{from the heat and}} avoid dehydration. The women mint employees were judged to enjoy better working conditions than many other American women workers in the late nineteenth century.|$|E
5|$|On 23 September 1996, NSB's {{administration}} {{recommended that}} the purchase be terminated. However, this was put on hold by the board. Instead, a renegotiated contract was signed, whereby Siemens was obliged to deliver the locomotives, as specified, by mid-1997. If not, the two parties agreed that the contract would be terminated. By late 1996, five locomotives had been delivered, and these were returned to Kiel for upgrades. The first returned to Norway on 30 November 1996, after the ventilator motors had been upgraded, new oil <b>coolers</b> installed and other minor upgrades had been performed. From January 1997, they were put into regular use with freight trains on the Nordland Line. In mid-1997, number 664 was damaged in a fire caused by an incorrectly mounted exhaust system. In October 1997, cracks {{were found in the}} wheels, and all units were taken out of service while they were being fixed.|$|E

5|$|On December 11, 2002, President Bush {{extended}} the disaster declaration {{to include the}} Northern Mariana Islands, which allocated emergency disaster aid for the territory. The declaration provided funding for 75% of the budget for debris removal and emergency protective measures. Immediately following the typhoon, FEMA assigned various federal agencies {{to respond to the}} island of Rota. Officials airlifted about 3,600kg (8,000lbs) of emergency supplies including tents, tarps, water containers, <b>coolers,</b> cooking kits and electrical equipment. Military personnel were transported to assist in recovery efforts. By four months after the typhoon, 749individuals on the island registered through FEMA's teleregistration number. The United States Small Business Administration approved 147low– interest loans for $9.1million (2003USD, $ USD) to individuals and businesses and for economic injury on Rota. In all, disaster aid to Rota totaled $17.4million (2003USD, $. Additionally, President Bush authorized disaster assistance for the Federated States of Micronesia.|$|E

5000|$|Like the {{mercenary}} Ginyu Force (right {{down to the}} posing) {{called upon}} by Frieza on Planet Namek, <b>Cooler's</b> Armored Squadron (Kūra Kikō Sentai) composes the elder brother's own special fighting team. These three warriors serve as <b>Cooler's</b> subordinates {{throughout the course of}} the film. Their dress is the customary garb of soldiers in Frieza's military; an extended length of armor juts from their left shoulder, while the uniforms themselves are in <b>Cooler's</b> primary colors of purple and white, they are shown to have a habit of blocking or reflecting Ki Blasts rather than dodging them. The team is made up of <b>Cooler's</b> right-hand man Sauzer (known as Salza in Funimation's English dub), a blue skinned [...] "pretty-boy" [...] commander with blonde hair and a French accent, who is able to slice through objects using a blade of ki formed in his right hand and very similar to Zarbon in appearance; Naise (known as Neiz in Funimation's English dub), an amphibian-like tall, brown reptilian creature who can retract the whole of his head into his body, who can fire an electrical attack that can immobilize his opponents; and Doore (Dōre), who is large, green-skinned and long-haired, never seen without his helmet. The henchmen's names are derived from puns; in this case, it is condiments and salad dressings. All three are killed by Piccolo, who obliterates Doore with a Ki blast, burns Neiz alive with his own attack, and impales Salza with the Special Beam Cannon.
