25|$|The {{administration}} initially {{denied the}} union recognition. While the university discouraged {{the formation of}} labor unions, arguing that “it can do more ‘for’ the employee than a union,” Local 77 denounced this idea as “deepening the basic problem,” suggesting that “Employees {{need to have a}} voice in their own future; and that voice <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>come</b> through collective bargaining...Only then may employees negotiate and sign a contract as mutual, equal participants rather than dependents of a paternal employer with unilateral decision-making power. Only then will the psychology of dependence be overcome.” The black work force had little power in the grievance procedures.|$|E
25|$|Arbitration can {{be either}} {{voluntary}} or mandatory (although mandatory arbitration <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>come</b> from a statute or from a contract that is voluntarily entered into, in which the parties agree to hold all existing or future disputes to arbitration, without necessarily knowing, specifically, what disputes will ever occur) and {{can be either}} binding or non-binding. Non-binding arbitration is similar to mediation in that a decision cannot be imposed on the parties. However, the principal distinction is that whereas a mediator will try to help the parties find a middle ground on which to compromise, the (non-binding) arbitrator remains totally removed from the settlement process and will only give a determination of liability and, if appropriate, {{an indication of the}} quantum of damages payable. By one definition arbitration is binding and non-binding arbitration is therefore technically not arbitration.|$|E
500|$|There {{are many}} {{similarities}} between Gregory's theology and neoplatonist philosophy, especially that of Plotinus. Specifically, {{they share the}} idea that the reality of God is completely inaccessible to human beings and that man <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>come</b> to see God through a spiritual journey in which knowledge [...] is rejected in favour of meditation. Gregory does not refer to any neoplatonist philosophers in his work, and there is only one disputed passage which may directly quote Plotinus. Considering this, it seems possible that Gregory was familiar with Plotinus and perhaps other figures in neoplatonism. However, some significant differences between neoplatonism and Gregory's thought exist, such as Gregory's statement that beauty and goodness are equivalent, which contrasts with Plotinus' view that they are two different qualities.|$|E

In his view, delegates should have only recommended amendments to the Articles of Confederation. Edmund Randolph had changed from his opposition in the Philadelphia Convention to now supporting adoption for the sake of preserving the Union. He noted that the Confederation was [...] "totally inadequate". George Mason countered that a national, consolidated government would overburden Virginians with direct taxes in addition to state taxes, and that government of an extensive territory must necessarily destroy liberty. Madison pointed out that the history of Confederations like that provided in the Articles of Confederation government were inadequate in the long run, both with the ancients and with the modern (1700s) Germans, Dutch and Swiss. They brought [...] "anarchy and confusion", disharmony and foreign invasion. Efficient government <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>come</b> from direct operation on individuals, it can never flow from negotiations among a confederation's constituent states.|$|E

However, [...] "It is not {{the essence of the}} Divine, to create Worlds and sustain them", as this ability is only external to the Infinite essence. Creation only derives from God's revelatory [...] "speech" [...] (as in Genesis 1), and even this is unlike the external speech of Man, as it too remains [...] "within" [...] God.

2500|$|Śabda (शब्द), {{relying on}} word, {{testimony}} of {{past or present}} reliable experts. Hiriyanna explains Sabda-pramana as a concept which means reliable expert testimony. The schools of Hinduism which consider it epistemically valid suggest that a human being needs to know numerous facts, and with the limited time and energy available, he can learn {{only a fraction of}} those facts and truths directly. [...] He must rely on others, his parent, family, friends, teachers, ancestors and kindred members of society to rapidly acquire and share knowledge and thereby enrich each other's lives. This means of gaining proper knowledge is either spoken or written, but through Sabda (words). The reliability of the source is important, and legitimate knowledge <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>come</b> from the Sabda of reliable sources.

[...] Anderson has since said that the first album was about [...] "sex and depression in equal measure". All the latter-day lyrics for the first album were directly influenced by extremely personal and emotional experiences in Anderson's life. [...] "So Young", featuring a piano bridge courtesy of Ed Buller, was about his girlfriend's overdose. Anderson says: [...] "it deals with the knife-edge of being young." [...] "The Next Life", which was Butler's first serious piano part, was a lament to his deceased mother, while [...] "Breakdown" [...] dealt with his schoolfriend's descent into extreme depression. [...] "She's Not Dead", was a true story written about the joint suicide of Anderson's aunt and her black clandestine lover.

2500|$|Ecological fitting {{represents}} a contrasting view to, and null hypothesis for, {{the hypothesis that}} current species interactions are evidence of coevolution. Coevolution occurs when each species in a relationship imposes evolutionary selection on the other(s). [...] Examples could include mutualisms or predator-prey systems. [...] The traditional view of plant-insect, host-parasite, and other tightly associated species, explained by Ehrlich & Raven (1964) defines coevolution as the primary mechanism for these associations [...] In his 1980 paper, Janzen gives a response to these adaptationist explanations of why a phenotype or species might exist in a particular environment, and expressed his concern with what he perceived as an overuse of coevolutionary explanations for current species associations. [...] He stated {{that it would be}} difficult to distinguish between coevolution and ecological fitting, leading ecologists to potentially spurious explanations of current species associations. [...] It is difficult to determine whether a close relationship is the result of coevolution or of ecological fitting because ecological fitting is a sorting process in which only associations that 'fit', or increase fitness (biology), will be maintained. [...] When trying to determine which process is at work in a particular interaction, it is important to remember that species <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>come</b> into contact through biotic expansion and ecological fitting, followed by adaptation or coevolution. [...] Thus, both processes are important in shaping interactions and communities.|$|E
2500|$|Edmund Craster {{argued that}} the {{original}} Historia, or rather its [...] "original core", was composed in the mid-10th century soon after the visit of King Edmund (c. 945). He {{argued that the}} text is best represented by Ff. 1.27, which ends at chapter 28, thus omitting material dealing directly with the period of Æthelred and Cnut. He theorised that chapters 29 to 32 were added in the 1030s, sometime after 1016, it was claimed, chapters 14–19½ along with chapter 33 were interpolated, a claim devised to explain the reference to the Battle of Assandun (1016) contained in chapter 16. Craster's arguments were criticised {{in the introduction to}} South's 2002 edition, where it was argued that the alleged Assandun interpolation was in fact {{an important part of the}} narrative, an argument earlier made by historian Luisella Simpson. South was inclined to date the narrative as a whole to the mid- or late 11th century, but adds that confidence <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>come</b> from further stylistic analysis. David Rollason, specialist in Durham history, has backed a similar date, though he does not suggest, like South, that the text was part of an Anglo-Norman revival in history writing. South also stressed that the Historia was a composite work, and that different passages used by the compiler probably do have earlier dates.|$|E
