30|$|Nanomaterial’s size is also {{crucial in}} {{determining}} nanoparticle distribution; the reticule endothelial systems, {{notably in the}} liver, spleen and kidney, were implicated in sequestrating larger percentage of these materials {{within the range of}} 100 to 250  nm [21]. Nevertheless, surface modification was reported to alter these facts; for example, a layered double hydroxide nanocomposite with diameter size of 100 to 200  nm coated with chitosan showed a preference in distribution to the liver, lung, spleen and kidney [22]. Delivery of the same nanocomposite to the lung, but not the liver, kidney or spleen, was achieved through further addition of more chitosan [22]. This preferential distribution of the nanomaterial following addition of <b>coating</b> <b>substance</b> is attributed to better solubility, lesser aggregation and improved dispersion.|$|E

The ratio of galangal essential oil and maltodextrin studied were 1 : 8, 1 : 10, and 1 : 12. Emulsification was performed using Turrax homogenizer at 11. 500 rpm for 2 min. Microencapculation was performed by spray drying at inlet and outlet temperatures of 120 and 80 °C, respectively, and feed flow rate of 15 mL/min. The optimum conditions for microcapsules were determined based on the water content, aw value, surface- and entrapped-oil, and volatile compounds profile (total volatile and volatile composition) of the microcapsules.

A GFG- 1000 soot generator applying either nitrogen or argon as carrier gas and a miniCAST soot generator were utilized to generate soot particles. Different organic carbon (OC) to black carbon (BC) ratios were adjusted for the CAST-soot by varying the fuel to air ratio. The hygroscopic growth was investigated {{by means of}} the mobile Leipzig Aerosol Cloud Interaction Simulator (LACIS-mobile) and two different Hygroscopicity Tandem Differential Mobility Analyzers (HTDMA, VHTDMA). Two Cloud Condensation Nucleus Counter (CCNC) were applied to measure the activation of the particles. For the untreated soot particles neither hygroscopic growth nor activation was observed at a supersaturation of 1 %, with exception of a partial activation of GFG-soot generated with argon as carrier gas. Coatings of succinic acid lead to a detectable hygroscopic growth of GFG-soot and enhanced the activated fraction of GFG- (carrier gas: argon) and CAST-soot, whereas no hygroscopic growth of the coated CAST-soot was found. Sulfuric acid coatings led to an OC-content dependent hygroscopic growth of CAST-soot. Such a dependence was not observed for activation measurements. Coating with sulfuric acid decreased the amount of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH), which were detected by AMS-measurements in the CAST-soot, and increased the amount of substances with lower molecular weight than the initial PAHs. We assume that these reaction products increased the hygroscopicity of the coated particles in addition to the <b>coating</b> <b>substance</b> itself...|$|E
40|$|This study assesses {{in detail}} the effects of {{heterogeneous}} chemistry on the particle surface and gas-phase composition by modeling the reversible co-adsorption of O 3, NO 2, and H 2 O on soot coated with benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) for an urban plume scenario {{over a period of}} five days. By coupling the Pöschl-Rudich-Ammann (PRA) kinetic framework for aerosols (Pöschl et al., 2007) to a box model version of the gas phase mechanism RADM 2, we are able to track individual concentrations of gas-phase and surface species {{over the course of several}} days. The flux-based PRA formulation takes into account changes in the uptake kinetics due to changes in the chemical gas-phase and particle surface compositions. This dynamic uptake coefficient approach is employed for the first time in a broader atmospheric context of an urban plume scenario. Our model scenarios include one to three adsorbents and three to five coupled surface reactions. The results show a variation of the O 3 and NO 2 uptake coefficients of more than five orders of magnitude over the course of simulation time and a decrease in the uptake coefficients in the various scenarios by more than three orders of magnitude within the first six hours. Thereafter, periodic peaks of the uptake coefficients follow the diurnal cycle of gas-phase O 3 -NO x reactions. Physisorption of water vapor delays the half-life of the <b>coating</b> <b>substance</b> BaP by up to a factor of seven by permanently occupying ~ 75 % of the soot surface. Soot emissions modeled by replenishing reactive surface sites lead to maximum gas-phase O 3 depletions of 41 ppbv for an hourly and 7. 8 ppbv for a six-hourly replenishment cycle. This conceptual study highlights the interdependence of co-adsorbing species and their non-linear gas-phase feedback. It yields further insight into the atmospheric importance of the chemical oxidation of particles and guides future modeling and experimental investigations of the heterogeneous chemistry and chemical aging of aerosols...|$|E
40|$|Canned foods have a {{long history}} of success and are likely to remain popular for the {{foreseeable}} future owing to their convenience, long shelf life and economy. Interest in ﬁsh consumption has increased in recent years due to the wide range of its health beneﬁts. In addition to fresh product, canned ﬁsh enables a delayed consumption of this appreciated kind of food. Among the different types of ﬁsh, in Portugal, the most used in canning manufacture are sardines, tuna, anchovies, mackerels. Vegetable oils and tomato sauce are usually adopted as coatings (liquid medium). In fact, oil has a preserving effect and contributes to make the product more palatable. Its protective action lies in the ability to insulate products from air, rather than having an active bacteriostatic or bactericidal action. Among the different types of coatings the most commonly used in canning are: olive oil, seed oils and different sauces, such as tomato sauce. Tomato sauce has also vegetable oil on its formulation. The amount of <b>coating</b> <b>substance</b> can affect the nutritional composition as well as texture properties of the sardines. The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of different types of coatings on texture and nutritional properties of whole, skinless and boneless canned Portuguese Sardines (Sardina pilchardus). An experimental investigation was carried out to assess the protein, lipid, carbohydrates and ash content, texture and colour profile of canned sardine with different kinds of coatings: olive oil, sunflower oil and tomato sauce. The obtained results showed that protein and carbohydrates content were not significantly influenced by the coating used, varying between 5 %- 8 % and 13 %- 18 %, respectively. For the moisture content it was found that the samples with tomato sauce were 2. 2 -fold higher than the samples with sunflower oil, and 1. 3 -fold higher than the samples with olive oil, independently of being whole, skinless or boneless sardine. As expected, the higher lipid content was found in samples with olive oil and sunflower oil, 3. 3 -fold higher than tomato sauce samples. Texture results showed that whole sardine samples yield the highest hardness values. It can be concluded that lipid content and moisture were greatly influenced by the type of coated added. On the contrary, texture parameter was influenced by the type of product: whole, skinless or boneless sardines...|$|E

Moreover, CA inhibited the shoot and root development, seedling dry weight accumulation, delayed the seed germination and seedling growth rate. CA treated seeds were susceptible to stress conditions that declined the seed germination potential under cold, high moisture and temperature stress conditions. Nevertheless, CL and E+CL coating polymer could maintain seed storability, which significantly improved seed germination and seedling performances. These improvements were attributed to maintain the nutritive reserve and dehydrogenase activity in seeds.

The antijelly T-globulin caused precipitation of the jelly layer, the density of precipitation varying between different eggs and being proportional to the T-globulin concentration. Agglutination of the. jelly substance of adjacent eggs, which is species specific, occurred frequently with higher T-globulin concentrations. Antiegg T-globulins (from antiserum against total homogenates of jelly-free eggs or the heat-stable fraction thereof) did not produce these effects. Instead, these 3 'globulins caused various structural alterations mostly representing stages in parthenogenetic activation. This species-specific activation was induced by the reaction of antibodies with some heat-stable egg antigens different from those involved in jelly precipitation. Surface alterations included the formation of small papillae, membrane blisters, hyaline layer, and activation membrane, the release of material from the cell surface, and the breakdown of cortical granules. These alterations were dependent on both T-globulin concentration and the variable reactivity among different females. Aster formation, found intracellularly, verified that the surface responses represented real parthenogenetic activation and were {{not the result of}} immune lysis.

40|$|The {{development}} of the sporopollenin orbicules (Ubisch bodies) on the tapetal cells of Lilium begins while the spores are still enclosed in the meiotic tetrads. Spherosome-like structures, the pro-orbicular bodies, accumulate {{in the vicinity of}} the plasmalemma early in the tetrad period, and are extruded into the space within the degenerating inner walls of the tapetal cells. There they acquire a coating of sporopollenin, the accretion continuing until after the release of the spores from the tetrads. Some orbicules remain attached to the plasmalemma by stalks. Synthesis of a material of the general class of sporopollenin begins in the primexine of the young spore in the mid-tetrad period, again outside of the cell membrane, but within the callose tetrad wall. A general scheme for sporopollenin formation in the anther is given. According to this, (a) precursors are synthesised both in the young spores and in the tapetum, and released into the extracellular space; and (b) polymerisation occurs on initiating sites outside of the cell membranes, these sites being the surface of the proorbicular bodies and of the special lamellae concerned in exine growth. Synthesis of sporopollenin in the anther is virtually complete before the main synthesis of the pigmented pollen <b>coat</b> <b>substances</b> (Pollenkitt) begins in the tapetum.

Water samples were prepared at room temperature or at 40 °C for three months to verify the storage effect on the coatings. Solid phase extraction was used to concentrate and to extract <b>coating</b> <b>substances.</b> Hormonal activities were checked in vitro using reporter gene bioassays. Except BBF, all extracts induced a weak but significant estrogenic agonist activity in the human cell line. Using an estrogenic antagonist (ICI- 182, 780), the answer was demonstrated specific in the bioassay. RR was the only extract to induce a concentration dependent anti-androgenic response in the MDA-KB 2 cell line. Analysis performed using GC-MS and HPLC-MS detected 12 substances {{in most of the}} extracts. 8 NIAS were present. Among them, 4 were identified with certainty: HMBT, BGA, DCU and BPA. Estrogenic potency was BPA>DCU>BGA>HMBT. HMBT was also anti-androgenic at high concentration. Combining chemical analysis and bioassays data, we demonstrated that in the RR and the RR 40 extracts, the observed estrogenic response was mainly due to BPA, the anti-androgenic activity of RR could be due to a synergism between HMBT and BPA. For MC and AA, estrogenic responses appear to be due to the presence of DCU. Except BBF, storage conditions tended to increase estrogenic activities in all extracts. However, in term of risk assessment, activities observed were negligible. This work demonstrated that sensitive bioassays are pertinent tools in complement to chemical analysis to monitor and check the presence of NIAS with hormonal activity in coating extracts...|$|R

The transfer of fluorescent model substances as well as the drug paclitaxel from coated balloons to the simulated vessel wall was evaluated using this method.

In the case of fluorescein sodium, rhodamin b and paclitaxel, vast amounts of the <b>coated</b> <b>substance</b> were lost during the simulated passage and only very small fractions of about 1 % of the total load were transferred to the gel.

Transfer of the hydrophobic model substance triamterene was however nearly unaffected by the preliminary tracking procedure with transferred fractions ranging from 8 % to 14 %. Analysis of model substance distribution yielded inhomogeneous distributions indicating that the coating was not evenly distributed on the balloon surface and that a great fraction of the coating liquid did not penetrate the folds of the balloon.
