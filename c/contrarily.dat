5|$|Hemmings {{conducted}} a study that surveyed 102 progressive heads—broadly defined—of infant, elementary, and secondary schools about Neill's influence. Their responses indicated that Neill had significant impact on how the profession perceived teacher–pupil relations. The respondents also reported significant influence from Neill on moral and sex education. <b>Contrarily,</b> Neill had little impact on school curriculum and classroom teaching methods. Hemmings received little response from heads of state comprehensive schools.|$|E
5|$|Critics of the ESRB have {{asserted}} that the organization has {{a conflict of interest}} because of its vested interest in the video game industry, and that the ESRB does not rate certain games, such as the Grand Theft Auto series, harshly enough for their violent or sexual content in order to protect their commercial viability. <b>Contrarily,</b> other critics have argued that, at the same time, the ESRB rates certain games too strongly for their content, and that its influence has stifled the viability of adult-oriented video games due to the board's restrictions on how they are marketed and sold.|$|E
5|$|Since the mid-1990s, {{gun control}} advocates have voiced {{concern over the}} {{perceived}} loophole in legislation, and campaigned to require background checks and record-keeping for all gun sales. <b>Contrarily,</b> gun rights advocates have stated {{that there is no}} loophole, that current laws provide a single, uniform set of rules for commercial gun sellers regardless of the place of sale, and that no part of the United States Constitution empowers the federal government to regulate non-commercial, intrastate transfers of legal firearms types between private citizens.|$|E

25|$|Local {{application}} of estrogen in the rat hippocampus {{has been shown}} to inhibit the re-uptake of serotonin. <b>Contrarily,</b> local {{application of}} estrogen {{has been shown to}} block the ability of fluvoxamine to slow serotonin clearance, suggesting that the same pathways which are involved in SSRI efficacy may also be affected by components of local estrogen signaling pathways.|$|E
25|$|René Descartes <b>contrarily</b> {{believed}} that non-humans are automata, complex machines with no soul, mind, or reason. In Cartesian dualism, consciousness was unique to human among all other animals and linked to physical matter by divine grace. However, close analysis shows that many human {{features such as}} complex sign usage, tool use, and self-consciousness {{can be found in}} some animals.|$|E
25|$|<b>Contrarily,</b> certain Anabaptists, Huguenots, and Bohemian Brethren were premillennial. Michael Servetus {{taught a}} chiliastic view, {{though he was}} denounced by the Reformers as a heretic and {{executed}} in Geneva under Calvin's authority. A few in the mainstream accepted it, such as Joseph Mede (1586–1638) and possibly Hugh Latimer (died 1555), {{but it was never}} a conventional belief throughout the period.|$|E
25|$|Luxembourgish, a Moselle Franconian {{language}} formerly {{regarded as}} a variety of German, is native to Arelerland, {{the eastern part of}} the Belgian province of Luxembourg, including the city of Arlon (Arel).

25|$|Until the 1970s, the Breton {{road network}} was poor because {{maritime}} and rail transport prevailed. The French president Charles de Gaulle implemented a major road construction {{plan in the}} 1970 and Brittany received over 10 billion francs of investments during 25 years. More than 10,000km of motorways were built, permitting Breton road transport to multiply by four. The Breton motorways are not toll roads, <b>contrarily</b> to the usual French highways.|$|E
25|$|With this album, Prigent also affirms {{his writing}} style. His verses are mostly octosyllables with, generally, a median caesura. This type of verse is very {{frequent}} in Breton, since short words are common, and thus long verses unneeded. He only writes in Breton, a language that, according to Prigent, kept its sacred aspect, <b>contrarily</b> to French. As a consequence, some lyrics remain untranslatable, even for their bilingual author.|$|E
25|$|Tableaux with {{unification}} can {{be proved}} complete: if {{a set of}} formulae is unsatisfiable, it has a tableau-with-unification proof. However, actually finding such a proof may be a difficult problem. <b>Contrarily</b> to the case without unification, applying a substitution can modify the existing part of a tableau; while applying a substitution closes at least a branch, it may make other branches impossible to close (even if the set is unsatisfiable).|$|E
25|$|Taoism was {{advocated}} by Laozi, {{and believed that}} human nature was good and can achieve perfection by returning to original state. It believed that like a baby, humans are simple and innocent although with development of civilizations it lost its innocence only {{to be replaced by}} fraud and greed. 	<b>Contrarily</b> to other schools, it did not want to gain influence in the offices of states and Laozi even refused to be in the minister of the state of Chu.|$|E
25|$|On June 19, Instant replay {{was used}} {{twice in the}} Tigers' 10-4 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers at Comerica Park, the first time that's {{happened}} in league history. Miguel Cabrera's third-inning single {{off the top of}} the wall is called a home run after instant replay review shows that it had actually cleared the wall. <b>Contrarily,</b> Dusty Ryan's fourth-inning home run was overturned to a ground rule double. Later that weekend, the Tigers won the series with a sweep.|$|E

Paraurgman (1988), Len Berry, Jane Kingman-Brundage, Christopher Hart, and Christopher Lovelock (1994), {{felt that}} poor {{customer}} service was the problem. They gave us fishbone diagramming, service charting, Total Customer Service (TCS), the service profit chain, service gaps analysis, the service encounter, strategic service vision, service mapping, and service teams.

25|$|The Workman layout {{employs a}} {{hypothesis}} about the preferential movement of each finger rather than categorically considering the lowest letter row to be least accessible. Specifically, {{the index finger}} prefers to curl inwards rather than stretch outwards. So for the index finger, the position of second preference goes to the bottom row rather than the top row. <b>Contrarily,</b> the middle and ring fingers are relatively long and prefer to stretch out rather than curl in. Based on this, weighting is allotted to each key specifically rather than each row generically.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 he took {{an active}} part in the {{campaign}} in favour of the European constitution during the French referendum. The treaty was considered by {{a large part of the}} left as a European version of globalisation, and Cohn-Bendit became loathed by treaty opponents as one of the symbols of centre-left leaders collaborating with neo-liberalism through international institutions, along with Pascal Lamy from the Socialist Party. He also singled himself out by appearing publicly with right-wing leaders, <b>contrarily</b> to the tactics adopted by the Green Party and the centre-left during that campaign.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the spell}} of {{liberalization}} promoted by the new communist leader, Nicolae Ceaușescu, Ivașcu {{became a member of}} the Academy of Social and Political Sciences. In 1969 and 1971, he received the Romanian Writers' Union Prize. From 1971 until his death, Ivașcu directed România Literară, the Writers' Union magazine. According to Manolescu, who was to succeed him there, the move from Contemporanul to România Literară was rather a demotion, signaling that Ceaușescu did not trust him. Others <b>contrarily</b> note that Ceaușescu handpicked Ivașcu to direct the magazine after the fall from favor of a previous editor, Nicolae Breban. Breban had made public his criticism of the July Theses, through which Ceaușescu had reintroduced hardline Marxism-Leninism.|$|E
25|$|A genetic {{predisposition}} to keratoconus has been observed, {{with the disease}} running in certain families, and incidences reported of concordance in identical twins. The frequency of occurrence in close family members is not clearly defined, though it {{is known to be}} considerably higher than that in the general population, and studies have obtained estimates ranging between 6% and 19%. Two studies involving isolated, largely homogenetic communities have <b>contrarily</b> mapped putative gene locations to chromosomes 16q and 20q. Most genetic studies agree on an autosomal dominant model of inheritance. A rare, autosomal dominant form of severe keratoconus with anterior polar cataract is caused by a mutation in the seed region of mir-184, a microRNA that is highly expressed in the cornea and anterior lens. Keratoconus is diagnosed more often in people with Down's syndrome, though the reasons for this link have not yet been determined.|$|E
25|$|Andronikos {{was born}} from Şeytanoğlu's first marriage. His stepmother, a Romanian, was either the {{daughter}} of Mircea Ciobanul and Doamna Chiajna or, <b>contrarily,</b> of Mircea III Dracul. Andronikos was the one of several children: Şeytanoğlu had two other much younger sons, Demetrios (born 1566) and John (born 1570), {{and at least two}} daughters, one of whom was Andronikos' senior. The recipient of a classical education at his father's palace in Anhialo, Andronikos learned to speak and write in Greek, Italian, German, New Latin, and Ottoman Turkish. During his son's early years, Şeytanoğlu pursued a political alliance with the Rhali merchants, marrying Andronikos' elder sister to one member of that family, setting her a dowry at 40,000 ducats. Another sister reinforced the family's genealogical claims by marrying Anthony Kantakouzenos, a merchant from the Crimean Khanate. In 1576, Şeytanoğlu oversaw the marriage between Andronikos and Irene, daughter of the merchant Jacob Rhali from Edirne.|$|E
25|$|Apparently, total exergy cost of {{wind and}} natural-gas fired {{technologies}} are almost the same, but <b>contrarily</b> to the wind power plants, the non-renewable unit exergy costs of NG-fired power plants is practically equal to the total cost. It {{should be noted that}} this result is a consequence of the efficiency assumed for wind power plants. If energy storage is {{to be taken into account}} for intermittent technologies such as wind farms, the total exergy cost could be slightly increased. The upstream and downstream CO2 emissions in the coal route represent a very small part of the total CO2 emissions, if compared with the direct emissions of coal burning in the power plant. Finally, it is pointed out that controversies related to the flooding dams of vast zones with complex ecosystems should be carefully analysed since, according to the results reported by Dones et al., the GHG emissions could be increased up to achieve emission levels comparable to those of gas combined cycles power plants.|$|E
25|$|Many {{studies have}} found that the {{frequency}} of occurrence of certain congenital malformations depends on the sex of the child (table). For example, pyloric stenosis occurs more often in males while congenital hip dislocation is four to five times more likely to occur in females. Among children with one kidney, there are approximately twice as many males, whereas among children with three kidneys there are approximately 2.5 times more females. The same pattern is observed among infants with excessive number of ribs, vertebrae, teeth and other organs which in a process of evolution have undergone reduction—among them there are more females. <b>Contrarily,</b> among the infants with their scarcity, there are more males. Anencephaly is shown to occur approximately twice as frequently in females. The number of boys born with 6 fingers is two times higher than the number of girls. Now various techniques are available to detect congenital anomalies in fetus before birth.|$|E
25|$|The Allied {{general staff}} and key statesmen, after {{capturing}} the original invasion plans, were initially jubilant {{that they had}} potentially won a key victory in the war before the campaign was even fought. <b>Contrarily,</b> General Gamelin and Lord Gort, {{the commander of the}} BEF, were shaken into realizing that whatever the Germans came up with instead would not be what they had initially expected. More and more Gamelin became convinced that the Germans would try to attempt a breakthrough by concentrating their mechanized forces. They could hardly hope to break the Maginot Line on his right flank or to overcome the allied concentration of forces on the left flank. That only left the centre. But most of the centre was covered by the river Meuse. Tanks were useless in defeating fortified river positions. However at Namur the river made a sharp turn to the east, creating a gap between itself and the river Dyle. This Gembloux Gap, ideal for mechanized warfare, was a very dangerous weak spot. Gamelin decided to concentrate half of his armoured reserves there. Of course the Germans might try to overcome the Meuse position by using infantry. But that could only be achieved by massive artillery support, the build-up of which would give Gamelin ample warning.|$|E
500|$|... "Crack Music" [...] {{continues}} the avenue of socio-political commentary initiated within [...] "Heard 'Em Say." [...] However, two songs express polar opposite tones; where [...] "Heard 'Em Say" [...] was self-effacing and passive-aggressive, [...] "Crack Music" [...] is audacious and straightforward. In the song, West dually discusses the spread and devastating impact {{of crack cocaine}} in black communities and champions the sovereignty of music pioneered by black musicians, metaphorically equating their <b>contrarily</b> addictive power and influence on American society. On the sentimental [...] "Roses", Kanye gives a firsthand account of the hospitalization of his ailing grandmother within a melancholic poem to produce {{a critique of the}} healthcare system.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{debated the}} success of the show's premise. Peter Scisco of ComputerLife {{appreciated}} that the team [...] "rely on their brains, not mutant superpowers". People praised Turner's shift from the [...] "politically correct claptrap" [...] of Captain Planet and the Planeteers, giving Real Adventures a B grade as [...] "children's programming the way it oughta be". The authors of 1998's Saturday Morning Fever <b>contrarily</b> felt the show lacked [...] "the sense of why the original was so successful". They disliked H-B's packaging of disparate seasons as one series, preferring the second for its characters and classic references. Greg Aaron of HotWired praised the franchise's return but warned against QuestWorld hype, arguing that [...] "it will take more than visual sophistication to hook today's viewers".|$|E
500|$|The first {{movement}} {{begins with}} violas softly oscillating between the C and A notes; after four {{bars of the}} single, minimally-inflected line, a pair of bassoons enters with the initial theme. The beginning {{has been described by}} Nielsen scholar Robert Simpson, in his own words, as like [...] "in outer space" [...] and the wave-like line [...] "appears from nowhere, as if one were suddenly made aware of time as a dimension". The very first theme ends at b.20 with a descending scale slide, followed by a fortissimo interruption from violas and a subsequent horn and flute dialogue. The prominent feature of instrumental pairing does not lead to any permanent thematic or textural stability, but <b>contrarily</b> grows into a persistent textural sparseness.|$|E
500|$|Opposition {{came from}} both Conservative and National Liberal legislators, who viewed Northern Dobruja as an inhospitable, nonstrategic and non-Romanian territory. <b>Contrarily,</b> with his {{proclamation}} to {{the peoples of}} Northern Dobruja, Kogălniceanu enshrined the standard patriotic narrative of the events: he asserted that the region had been [...] "united" [...] with Romania, as a [...] "Romanian land", because of the people's wishes and sacrifices. During the heated parliamentary sessions of late September 1878, he helped swing the {{vote in favor of}} the annexation, with speeches which also helped transform the public's mood, and which promised a swift process of Romanianization. These addresses are credited with having first backdated the Romanian claim to ca. 1400, when Wallachia briefly held the Principality of Karvuna.|$|E
500|$|The {{reception}} of Moș Nichifor Coțcariul by Junimea illustrated its ambivalence toward Creangă. Maiorescu found the text [...] "interesting {{in its way}} and decisively Romanian", but asked Convorbiri Literare journal to either modify it or refrain from publishing it altogether. This was complemented by its author's own self-effacing assessment: calling the text [...] "a childish thing", he suggested to Maiorescu that revisions were needed, stating [...] "I have written it long, {{because there was no}} time for me to write it short." [...] <b>Contrarily,</b> the writer's posterity referred to it as one of the greatest Romanian contributions to the genre: according to George Călinescu, the insight into Nichifor's musings resulted in transforming the writing as a whole into [...] "the first great Romanian novella with a stereotypical hero", while Voinescu described the entire story as [...] "a true masterpiece." ...|$|E
500|$|August Brown of the Los Angeles Times {{gave the}} song a {{negative}} review, commenting that [...] "Kendrick Lamar somehow packs more personality into a halfhearted hook on 'Forbidden Fruit' than Cole {{gets in the}} song". Phillip Mlynar of Spin felt that [...] " [...] quirky bass line and warm-keys motif are so recognizable that it's a brow-furrowing challenge to hear anything other than Q-Tip and Phife's original vocals {{in the space between}} the beat and the new raps." [...] Mlynar further stated that [...] "Cole himself (along with Kendrick Lamar's guest spot) ends up evaporating entirely — he's upstaged by loftier artists who aren't even there." [...] <b>Contrarily,</b> Ali Shaheed Muhammad of A Tribe Called Quest expressed his appreciation for Cole's production: [...] " [...] didn't like try to do what was already done. [...] brought other parts to the sample that you caught that I was like, 'Oh, nice!'" ...|$|E
500|$|Today spoken {{primarily}} by working- and middle-class African Americans, African American Vernacular English (AAVE) is also largely non-rhotic and likely originated among enslaved Africans and African Americans influenced {{primarily by}} the non-rhotic, non-standard English dialects of the Old South. A minority of linguists, <b>contrarily,</b> propose that AAVE mostly traces back to African languages spoken by the slaves who had to develop a pidgin or Creole English to communicate with slaves of other ethnic and linguistic origins. AAVE shares important commonalities with older Southern American English and so probably developed to a highly coherent and homogeneous variety in the 19th or early 20th century. AAVE is commonly stigmatised in North America {{as a form of}} [...] "broken" [...] or [...] "uneducated" [...] English, also common of modern Southern American English, but linguists today recognise both as fully developed varieties of English with their own norms shared by a large speech community.|$|E
500|$|The GBA port has {{received}} generally positive critical reviews, currently holding an aggregate score of 79% on both GameRankings and Metacritic. Most critics found {{the game to}} be a solid yet conventional action-platformer that successfully adheres to the classic Mega Man formula. Electronic Gaming Monthly summarized that Mega Man & Bass is [...] "one of the best action games on GBA" [...] and [...] "a great, if slightly derivative, platformer" [...] with plenty of replay value due to the collectible CDs. GamePro {{was pleased with the}} game's fidelity to its predecessors when compared to the deviations made by the Mega Man Battle Network and Mega Man Zero series on the same system. GameSpy <b>contrarily</b> criticized its lack of innovation, declaring, [...] "Anyone that hasn't tried a Mega Man game yet would be better advised to spend $15 on a new copy of Mega Man 8 on the PSOne rather than paying $30 for an inferior retread of the same game".|$|E
500|$|During season ten, Rachel's brief {{romance with}} friend Joey drew strong {{criticism}} from both critics and fans, although the contested relationship did not harm viewership. Joshua Kurp of Splitsider {{believes that the}} Rachel/Joey/Ross love triangle {{is the main reason}} the show's final two seasons continued to perform well despite mediocre reviews. Eric Goldman of IGN referred to the Rachel-Joey storyline as [...] "questionable." [...] Entertainment Tonight Canada ranked [...] "The One After Rachel and Joey Kiss" [...] among the show's ten worst episodes at number five, with author I. P. Johnson panning it as [...] "desperate", concluding, [...] "Jeers for even conceiving this romantic plot; cheers for abandoning it". <b>Contrarily,</b> E! enjoyed Rachel and Joey as a couple because they brought out positive aspects in each other's personalities and share a similar sense of humor. Their relationship also spawned a debate among fans, who argued over whether making Rachel and Joey a couple was a bad idea. Jenna Mullins of E! determined that it is because [...] "It was too far into the series to throw these two together. They didn't make sense and their romantic scenes felt forced".|$|E
500|$|The game's {{aesthetics}} {{were strongly}} praised. One reviewer appreciated {{the variety of}} styles in the music; it {{has been compared to}} Yanni, Enya, John Tesh, and sci-fi scores. Alan Dang <b>contrarily</b> found the music at times [...] "neutral" [...] and generic; Paul Ward found it pleasant but sparse. Numerous critics praised the voice acting and dialogue. The game's cinematic cutscenes were also acclaimed; Computer and Video Games noted they were [...] "superbly used for laughs or to create a real sense of dramatic tension", while Next Generation wrote that Anachronox would be remembered as the germination point for blending interactive gaming and cinema. The Guardian, while also giving praise, found them somewhat predictable. Several reviewers praised the field map and level design of all but the last levels. Earlier ones were said to contain many [...] "little details that bring the game to life" [...] and significant immersion. The later levels were less well received, with one reviewer suspecting that ION Storm ran out of time to polish the game, as some end-game locations were [...] "hideously ugly, with huge slab-like polygons, dodgy backdrops and pixelated low resolution textures". The Guardian felt the lighting was too dark in general, while Kevin Cheung of The Sydney Morning Herald found the graphics blocky.|$|E
500|$|Like other {{samples of}} Germanophile media, Seara is widely {{alleged to have}} been the {{recipient}} of special propaganda funds from the German Empire and Austria-Hungary. According to historian Lucian Boia, Germanophile newspapers had little room for maneuver, given their unpopular agenda: [...] "of little interest, boycotted and with their offices once in a while assaulted by the 'indignant' public, [...] could never have supported themselves without an infusion of German money." [...] Similarly, researcher Carmen Patricia Reneti argues: [...] "Seara would [...] have been the paper most useful to German propaganda. [...] Minerva and Seara were read by just about no one." [...] Claims of German payments focus on Bogdan-Pitești's shady political dealings, the target of controversy since 1915. Boia notes that the patron, who had no reason for refusing German bribes, may have been genuinely committed to the Germanophile cause, regardless of such additional benefits. Boia also claims that, keeping in with a Romanian tradition of the [...] "baksheesh", the Francophile press may also have received funds from the Entente. <b>Contrarily,</b> historian Ion Bulei argues that [...] "fraudulent wheeler-dealer" [...] Bogdan-Pitești and his [...] "money obsessed" [...] patron were merely directing their support toward the highest bidder. According to various accounts, Bogdan-Pitești was diverting much of his own political payments into increasing his prestigious art collection or supporting his retinue.|$|E
500|$|Heavy {{criticism}} was {{directed toward the}} script, dialogue, and cutscene length. McShea felt that the unskippable cutscenes and [...] "the overabundance of story in Other M were a negative deviation from Metroid tradition". Kollar states that they [...] "often run as long as 15 minutes, exhausting players with repetition of obvious plot points and overwrought dialogue as mature and interesting as a teenager’s diary". Justin Haywald of 1UP.com complained that as the game progresses [...] "instead of getting more {{of the things that}} work , you get more of the things you don't care about [...] ". Donlan notes that the plot is considered as [...] "the future's dumbest soap opera". Wolinsky echoes the misgivings about Samus' immaturity, petulant behavior, and misguided loyalty. Tae K. Kim of GamePro writes that while the story and Samus' monologues did not compel them, [...] "it helped contextualize her entire existence" [...] which developed the character to [...] "an actual human being who's using the vastness of space to try and put some distance between herself and the past". <b>Contrarily,</b> Haywald found the portrayal [...] "lifeless and boring" [...] and [...] "nonsensical". G4tv's Abbie Heppe was critical on Samus's portrayal; she wrote that Samus [...] "cannot possibly wield the amount of power she possesses unless directed to by a man", and found that her anxiety attack cannot be reconciled with her previous portrayals. In Zero Punctuation, Ben [...] "Yahtzee" [...] Croshaw derided the game's story as a [...] "bloated, cancerous mass [...] turning [...] into a shrieking mimsy in a submissive relationship with a bellend in a fancy cap." [...] Croshaw also states that the gameplay is [...] "infinitely stronger [...] in that it's merely bad." ...|$|E
500|$|George Călinescu also {{assessed}} {{that these}} literary connections served {{to highlight the}} elevated nature of Creangă's style, his [...] "erudite device", concluding: [...] "Writers such as Creangă can only show up in places where the word is ancient and equivocal, and where experience has been condensed into unchanging formulas. It {{would have been more}} natural for such a prose writer to have emerged a few centuries later, into an era of Romanian humanism. Born much earlier, Creangă showed up where there exists an ancient tradition, and therefore a species of erudition,... in a mountain village... where the people is unmixed and keeping [...]" [...] Outlining his own theory about the aspects of [...] "national specificity" [...] in Romanian letters, he expanded on these thoughts, listing Creangă and Eminescu as [...] "core Romanians" [...] who illustrated a [...] "primordial note", complemented by the [...] "southern" [...] and [...] "Balkan" [...] group of Caragiale and others. Claiming that the [...] "core" [...] presence had [...] "not primitive, but ancient" [...] origins, perpetuated by [...] "stereotyped wisdom" [...] and [...] "energetic fatalism", he asserted: [...] "Creangă shows our civilization's contemporaneity with the world's oldest civilizations, our Asian age." [...] The alternating national and regional characteristics in Creangă's writings are related by historian Neagu Djuvara with the writer's place of birth, an affluent village in an isolated region, contrasting heavily with the 19th century Wallachian countryside: [...] "if the mud hut villages of the Danube flood plain are to be taken into account, one finds himself in a different country." [...] Ornea, who noted that Eminescu effectively shared Creangă's worldview, believed the latter to have been dominated by nostalgia for a world of independent landowning peasants, and argued that Creangă's literary and political outlook were both essentially conservative. Ornea commented: [...] "One could say that it was through [...] that the writer debuted and that, within the space of his work it became, in its own right, an expression of the world that was about to vanish." [...] Commenting on Creangă's [...] "robust realism" [...] and lack of [...] "sentimentality", Vianu <b>contrarily</b> asserted: [...] "Creangă's nostalgia... has an individual, not social, sense." ...|$|E
