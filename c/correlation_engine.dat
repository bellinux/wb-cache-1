Alert {{correlation}} is {{a system}} which receives alerts from heterogene-ous Intrusion Detection Systems and reduces false alerts, detects high level pat-terns of attacks, increases the meaning of occurred incidents, predicts the future states of attacks, and detects root cause of attacks. To reach these goals, many algorithms have been introduced {{in the world with}} many advantages and disad-vantages. In this paper, we are trying to present a comprehensive survey on al-ready proposed alert correlation algorithms. The approach of this survey is mainly focused on algorithms in <b>correlation</b> <b>engines</b> which can work in enter-prise and practical networks.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedComputer network defense systems should be sufficiently integrated to pull data from any information source, model an expert cyber analyst’s decision process, continuously adapt to an evolving cyber threat environment, and amalgamate with industry standard network hardware. Unfortunately, cyber defense systems are generally stovepipe solutions {{that do not}} natively integrate disparate network systems. <b>Correlation</b> <b>engines</b> are generally limited in capability, extensibility, and do not evolve with a dynamic cyber threatscape. Current network defense systems mitigate known vulnerabilities, but effective methods of traffic analysis capable of detecting unknown exploits and identifying advanced persistent threats {{have yet to be}} developed. Expert analysts can isolate threats by manually aggregating data sources and distinguishing patterns that indicate a compromise, but there are insufficient skilled analysts available to combat the problem. This work demonstrates a process control configuration that can emulate the investigative process of a human cyber security expert into a pseudo cognitive apparatus capable of accessing several network available data sources, determining a network threat, and terminating a connection, in minutes. The investigative process to detect a PHPMyAdmin attack and issue a response was entirely configured in a vector relational data modeling environment.

40|$|<b>Correlation</b> <b>engines</b> {{have been}} {{evolving}} since {{the implementation of}} radar. In modern sensor fusion architectures, correlation and gridlock filtering are required to produce common, continuous, and unambiguous tracks of all objects in the surveillance areai. The objective {{is to provide a}} unified picture of the theatre or area of interest to battlefield decision makers, ultimately enabling them to make better inferences for future action and eliminate fratricide by reducing ambiguities. Here, correlation refers to association, which in this context is track-to-track association. A related process, gridlock filtering or gridlocking, refers to the reduction in navigation errors and sensor misalignment errors so that one sensor’s track data can be accurately transformed into another sensor’s coordinate system. As platforms gain multiple sensors, the correlation and gridlocking of tracks become significantly more difficult. Much of the existing correlation technology revolves around various interpretations of the generalized Bayesian decision rule: choose the action that minimizes conditional risk. One implementation of this principle equates the risk minimization statement to the comparison of ratios of a priori probability distributions to thresholds. The binary decision problem phrased in terms of likelihood ratios is also known as the famed Neyman-Pearson hypothesis test. Using another restatement of the principle for a symmetric loss function, risk minimization leads to a decision that maximizes the a posteriori probability distribution. Even for deterministic decision rules, situations can arise in correlation wher...|$|R

40|$|As {{enterprises}} deploy multiple {{intrusion detection}} sensors at key points in their networks, {{the issue of}} correlating messages from these sensors becomes increasingly important. A correlation capability reduces alert volume, and potentially improves detection performance through sensor reinforcement or complementarity. Correlation is especially advantageous when heterogeneous sensors are employed {{because of the potential}} to aggregate different views of the same incident. Emerging standards for sensor interoperability with respect to alert reporting facilitate the function of <b>correlation</b> <b>engines,</b> but these standards are still at an early stage of development. Furthermore, it is apparent that these standards will not enforce uniformity in, for example, attack description, complicating the task of correlation. The immature state of standards and nonuniformity of reporting both argue for correlation technologies that are robust, flexible, and function with comparatively few underlying assumptions. Herein, we present a case study of correlating several sensors listening to live traffic using a probabilistic correlation approach.

40|$|Current IEEE 802. 11 {{wireless}} {{networks are}} vulnerable to session hijacking attacks as the existing standards fail to address the lack of authentication of management frames and network card addresses, and rely on loosely coupled state machines. Even the new WLAN security standard - IEEE 802. 11 i does not address these issues. In our previous work, we proposed two new techniques for improving detection of session hijacking attacks that are passive, computationally inexpensive, reliable, and have minimal impact on network performance. These techniques utilise unspoofable characteristics from the MAC protocol and the physical layer to enhance confidence in the intrusion detection process. This paper extends our earlier work and explores usability, robustness and accuracy of these intrusion detection techniques by applying them to eight distinct test scenarios.

40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 85 - 88). The {{study of}} neural networks {{is inspired by}} the mystery of how the brain works. In a quest to solve this mystery, scientists and engineers {{hope that they will}} learn how to build more powerful computational systems that are capable of processing information much more efficiently than today’s digital computer systems. This dissertation involves a biologically inspired circuit which can be used as an alternative for a cross <b>correlation</b> <b>engine.</b> Cross correlation engines are widely used in spread spectrum, wireless communication systems that use digital spreading codes to divide a single communication medium into separate channels. This technology is used in many systems such as GPS, ZigBee and GSM mobile communications. The technology is renowned for its robustness and security since it is highly tolerant to signal jamming and spoofing. Digital spreading in wireless communication is also widely used in military systems and has recently been proposed for use in the medical sector for neural prostheses. A limitation of using digital spreading is that the computational demands on the cross <b>correlation</b> <b>engine</b> are normally quite high and is generally considered to be the limiting factor in designing low-power portable devices. In recent developments proposed by Tapson, it was shown that a two-neuron mutual inhibition network can be used to generate a cross correlation like function (Tapson et al., 2008). In this work, the two-neuron cross <b>correlation</b> <b>engine</b> is analysed specifically for application on a particular set of digital spreading codes called Gold codes. Based on the analysis, the neuron’s response to an input signal is optimised in favour of yielding a neural cross correlation that resembles the mathematical cross correlation more closely. The aim is to find a biologically inspired computer that is practically viable in an electrical engineering application involving a digital spread spectrum communication system...|$|E

As a part of a major multidisciplinary collaboration program, a benchmark modeling on a practical gas turbine combustor is successfully carried out, and the two-phase, steady, turbulent, compressible, reacting flow fields at both cruise and takeoff are obtained.
