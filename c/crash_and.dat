5|$|The {{survivor}} was Edgar Forwood, 67-year-old Managing-Director of Forwood Down and Company Ltd., a South Australian engineering company. He was {{the oldest}} person on board the flight, and probably the most experienced air traveller. He was interviewed by police in hospital in Perth, but {{was not aware of}} much detail about the final minutes of the flight. He said {{there was no sign of}} fire prior to the <b>crash</b> <b>and</b> no announcement to passengers to fasten their seat belts. He died six days after the <b>crash</b> <b>and</b> was buried at the North Road cemetery in Adelaide, his home town.|$|E
5|$|At Cortex's base, Uka Uka derides Cortex {{for failing}} to destroy <b>Crash</b> <b>and</b> replaces Cortex with his niece, Nina Cortex, despite protests from Neo, N. Gin and Tiny Tiger. Nina has Coco brainwashed and makes her {{participate}} {{in the construction of}} the Doominator. Throughout the course of the game, <b>Crash</b> <b>and</b> Aku Aku interrogate Tiny Tiger, Doctor N. Gin and Uka Uka on the whereabouts of Coco. When they confront Nina Cortex inside the Doominator robot, Nina summons her Arachnina cyborg and fights Crash. Crash eventually destroys the robot, liberating Coco and disabling the Doominator. The Doominator collapses and barely misses the Bandicoot home (and Crunch), sparing much of Wumpa Island. Escaping from the collapsed Doominator, Cortex praises Nina for betraying him, and promises to be more evil in the near future. The Bandicoots decide that it is time for celebration, leading Crash to shout his first word in the series and the object of their celebration: pancakes.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{sought to}} investigate the relationship between capacity and safety on freeway roadways in New Jersey. Using the State's roadway database, capacity was estimated for State roadways using the procedures in the Highway Capacity Manual. Crash prediction models were developed relating <b>crashes</b> <b>and</b> <b>crash</b> rates to the geometric variables used to estimate capacity {{as well as to}} capacity and v/c ratio. The research showed that as capacity increases the number of <b>crashes</b> <b>and</b> <b>crash</b> rate also increases. As v/c ratio increased the number of <b>crashes</b> <b>and</b> <b>crash</b> rate decreased indicating that congestion may result in reduced speeds and as a result a lower number of <b>crashes</b> <b>and</b> <b>crash</b> rates. The research points to the need to include operational parameters in performing road safety evaluations...|$|R
40|$|The {{magnitude}} of leftward bias demonstrated in pseudoneglect {{has been found}} to differ between younger and older adults in laboratory settings. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the association between age and asymmetries in navigation in a naturalistic setting by examining the frequency of the location of impact on participants' vehicles during <b>crashes</b> <b>and</b> near <b>crashes.</b> The location of impact following <b>crashes</b> <b>and</b> near <b>crashes,</b> <b>and</b> participant's age and gender were retrieved from the SHRP 2 NDS database, a large scale naturalistic driving study. Over the course of the study, data were collected from 3, 546 participants driving in the United States of America (right-side traffic directionality), which included 1, 465 <b>crashes</b> <b>and</b> 2, 722 near <b>crashes.</b> During <b>crashes</b> <b>and</b> near <b>crashes,</b> irrespective of age, the location impact was most often on the front side of the participant vehicle. In contrast with results from laboratory environments, age was not associated with the location of impact during <b>crashes</b> <b>and</b> near <b>crashes,</b> <b>and</b> overall, <b>crashes</b> were over-represented on the left side of the vehicle compared to the right. Specifically, crashes were 1. 41 times as likely to occur on the left compared to the right side of participants' vehicles. Overall, these findings inform future research that attempts to apply laboratory research, regarding asymmetry in navigation, to naturalistic settings...|$|R

5|$|Flight 710 was {{the second}} fatal and {{write-off}} accident of a Dash 7, and remains the deadliest.

It has since become the fourth-deadliest by Vnukovo Airlines Flight 2801. It remains the deadliest accident in Northern Norway.|$|E
5|$|In July 1943, a plane {{carrying}} Sikorski {{plunged into}} the sea immediately after takeoff from Gibraltar, killing all on board except the pilot. The exact circumstances of Sikorski's death have been disputed and {{have given rise to}} a number of different theories surrounding the <b>crash</b> <b>and</b> his death. Sikorski had been the most prestigious leader of the Polish exiles, and his death was a severe setback for the Polish cause.|$|E

5|$|Back on Earth, {{the world}} is {{suddenly}} terrorised by severe natural disasters, leading Aku Aku to conclude that Uka Uka is up to something. A confrontation with Uka Uka confirms his suspicions and nearly results in his destruction {{at the hands of}} the Elementals. Aku Aku returns to <b>Crash</b> <b>and</b> Coco Bandicoot and alerts them of the current situation, disclosing that the only way to stop the Elementals is to imprison them once more with the Crystals, which have been scattered across the Earth. Using Coco's new Virtual Reality Hub System, <b>Crash</b> <b>and</b> Coco travel the world and gather the Crystals, fending off attacks from Cortex's superweapon, Crunch Bandicoot, and the Elementals along the way. However, by the time the Crystals have been gathered and the Elementals have been put in their hibernation state, Crunch's elemental powers have reached maximum capacity, forcing Crash to battle Crunch at full power in Cortex's space station. Nevertheless, Crash defeats Crunch, which releases him from Cortex's control. Infuriated by this failure, Uka Uka attacks Cortex with a fireball, only to have it hit a vital part of the space station, which causes a chain reaction that results in the space station's self-destruction. Crash, Aku Aku, and Crunch escape and return to the Bandicoot home on Coco's space fighter ship, while Cortex and Uka Uka deploy an escape pod and end up landing somewhere in Antarctica, where Uka Uka furiously chases Cortex around a small ice floe.|$|E
