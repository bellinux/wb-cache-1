6000|$|By way of {{contributing}} what grace she could, Phoebe gathered some roses {{and a few}} other flowers, possessing either scent or beauty, and arranged them in a glass pitcher, which, having long ago lost its handle, was so much the fitter for a flower-vase.

50|$|A {{sacrificial}} {{altar and}} a chair are built for a priest either at a street entrance or {{in front of}} the village. The Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha sits {{in front of the}} chair. Under the <b>chair</b> are <b>plates</b> of rice flour and peaches. Sitting on the altar are three spirit tablets and three funeral banners. After noon, sheep, pigs, chicken, fruits, and cakes are donated by families that are displayed on the altar. A priest will put a triangular paper banner of three colors with special characters on every sacrifice. After the music begins to play, the priest hits the bell to call the hungry ghosts back to the table. He then throws the rice and peaches into the air in all directions to distribute them to the ghosts.|$|R
40|$|Background Bioaerosols {{are defined}} as {{airborne}} particles of liquid or volatile compounds that contain living organisms or have been released from living organisms. The creation of bioaerosols is a recognized consequence of certain types of dental treatment and represents a potential mechanism for the spread of infection. Objectives The aims {{of the present study}} were to assess the bioaerosols generated by certain dental procedures and to evaluate the efficiency of a commercially available Air Cleaning System (ACS) designed to reduce bioaerosol levels. Methods Bioaerosol sampling was undertaken in the absence of clinical activity (baseline) and also during treatment procedures (cavity preparation using an air rotor, history and oral examination, ultrasonic scaling and tooth extraction under local anaesthesia). For each treatment, bioaerosols were measured for two patient episodes (with and without ACS operation) and between five and nine bioaerosol samples were collected. For baseline measurements, 15 bioaerosol samples were obtained. For bioaerosol sampling, environmental air was drawn on to blood agar plates using a bioaerosol sampling pump placed in a standard position 20 cm from the dental <b>chair.</b> <b>Plates</b> were incubated aerobically at 37 degrees C for 48 hours and resulting growth quantified as colony forming units (cfu/m(3)). Distinct colony types were identified using standard methods. Results were analysed statistically using SPSS 12 and Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Results The ACS resulted in a significant reduction (p = 0. 001) in the mean bioaerosols (cfu/m(3)) of all three clinics compared with baseline measurements. The mean level of bioaerosols recorded during the procedures, with or without the ACS activated respectively, was 23. 9 cfu/m(3) and 105. 1 cfu/m(3) (p = 0. 02) for cavity preparation, 23. 9 cfu/m(3) and 62. 2 cfu/m(3) (p = 0. 04) for history and oral examination; 41. 9 cfu/m(3) and 70. 9 cfu/m(3) (p = 0. 01) for ultrasonic scaling and 9. 1 cfu/m(3) and 66. 1 cfu/m(3) (p = 0. 01) for extraction. The predominant microorganisms isolated were Staphylococcus species and Micrococcus species. Conclusion These findings indicate potentially hazardous bioaerosols created during dental procedures can be significantly reduced using an air cleaning system...|$|R

Objects in closest proximity to patients have the highest levels of MRSA and VRE.

[...] The subject reclines in a quiet, darkened room and drapes a hand holding a spoon {{over the edge of}} the bed or <b>chair,</b> placing a <b>plate</b> on the floor beneath the spoon. After checking the time, the subject tries to relax and fall asleep. When sleep is attained, the spoon will fall and strike the plate, awakening the subject, who then checks to see how much time has passed. The number of minutes passed is the sleep onset latency at that particular hour on that particular day.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The study {{presented}} here explores eating as a pedagogical practice by paying atten-tion to arrangements of {{things such as}} Christmas cookies, whole-wheat and white bread, frozen chicken, <b>plates,</b> <b>chairs,</b> tables, and freezers. Through a series of ethnographic research examples from German and Brazilian preschools, it investigates how eating in the kindergarten can be a sensual pleasure, a health risk, an ethnic custom, or a civil right within different local histories. Through specific arrangements of foods and other things, young children are educated to eat with moderation, to change their ethnic dietary habits, or to be “modern citizens”. Pedagogy can thus consist of doing public health, doing ethnic identity, or doing citizenship. Eating is an important way of doing pedagogy in early childhood education and care settings...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the changes in {{postural}} sway in static sitting and static standing as one ages. Past studies have indicated that static standing postural sway does increase, particularly after 70 years of age. The sample of this study had six age groups from ages 21 to 81 years old with a total of 68 subjects. Postural sway area was measured with the subject sitting upright for 60 seconds on a <b>chair</b> force <b>plate</b> and then standing on a standing force plate for 60 seconds. The results showed a minimal relationship (r = 0. 157) between age and sitting average sway, and a minimal relationship (r - 0. 243) between age and standing average sway. There was also a minimal relationship (r = 0. 153) between sitting average sway and standing average sway. Analysis of variance showed an insignificant difference within age groups and between age groups of sitting average sway F(6, 1. 029), p 3 ̆c 0. 416, and standing average sway F(6, 1. 063), p 3 ̆c 0. 394. Discrepancies of the study 2 ̆ 7 s results with the literature may be due to differences in apparatus used and research design. Possible sources of error are the small number of subjects in the 70 and older age group, inconsistencies of sitting and standing postures, and controlling extraneous variables in the questionnaire. The results imply that sitting and standing balance have different mechanisms and processes in maintaining these two postures. The influence of aging on sitting and standing postural sway is still inconclusive and ambiguous. It may be that the variability of the health status of older subjects may explain the inconsistencies of this study...|$|R
5000|$|The Turners' Company {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} Livery Companies in the City of London. Its origins go back to early medieval times: the first {{reference}} to a London turner dates to 1189. The medieval Company was a trade guild, set up to protect the interests of its members, whose skill was to turn and shape wooden objects on a lathe. They laid down standards for their products; they had a strict system of apprenticeship; they restricted competition from outsiders; and they collected for charity and funeral expenses. Unlike the richer Livery Companies the Turners were craftsmen, not merchants. Yet at a time when many everyday necessities, like <b>chairs,</b> cups and <b>plates,</b> were turned products, successful London turners could make a good living by the standards of the day. The contemporary Turners' Company reflects many of the traditions of earlier days. Its main objective remains to promote the craft of turning, which, in the 21st century, encompasses a broad spectrum of styles from the traditional and practical to the intricate and ornate right through to large statement pieces and avant garde works of art, always pushing the boundaries to see what can be achieved. Both leading professional turners and enthusiastic amateurs are members of the Company. The Company promotes the craft of turning by running a major exhibition, known as [...] "Wizardry in Wood", every four years. It holds turning competitions, and offers prizes and bursaries to established and aspirant turners. It supports the Register of Professional Turners, which gives details of leading turners and what they make. There is an active charity, with a significant focus on the craft: the Company has donated lathes to schools, including computer-controlled lathes for the use of disabled students. The Company also runs a lively social programme to promote friendship and good fellowship among its members and their guests.|$|R
