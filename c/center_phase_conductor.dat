50|$|The {{current drawn}} by {{non-linear}} loads, such as fluorescent & HID lighting and electronic equipment containing switching power supplies, often contains harmonics.

These power lines can be overhead power line <b>phase</b> <b>conductors</b> and shield wires or buried cable line <b>phase</b> <b>conductors.</b> The basis of the presented algorithm is the application of Biot-Savart law and the thin-wire approximation of cylindrical conductors.

40|$|AbstractLightning {{overvoltage}} is {{the major}} cause of the transmission line interruption in Malaysia. It {{is the main reason}} that endangers the safety and reliability of transmission line system. The phenomenon is a dominant factor considered in designing substations and transmission-line insulation, therefore its investigation is important. This work modelled a 132 kV overhead transmission line for shielding failure pattern recognition by using ATP-EMTP software, as they are vital to the evaluation of lightning performance. The modelled transmission-line is divided into few parts: wires (shield wires and <b>phase</b> <b>conductors),</b> towers, cross-arms, insulator strings, tower-surge impedance and tower-footing resistance. The developed model is simulated with four different magnitudes of lightning-strike current on each <b>phase</b> <b>conductor</b> in order to investigate the shielding failure voltage pattern across the line insulation in the transmission line system. When the lightning- strike current is injected from upper phase to lower <b>phase</b> <b>conductor,</b> the magnitude of the maximum induced voltage across the insulator string at those phases has been decreased. On the other hand, as the magnitude of the lightning- strike current has been increased, the magnitude of the maximum induced voltage across the insulator string at each phase will be increased. Flashover occurs when the voltage induced across the insulator string at each phase is equal or exceeds the CFO voltage. These analyses have been done based on the waveforms obtained from the simulations on developed model...|$|R

50|$|The zero {{sequence}} represents the {{component of the}} unbalanced phasors that is equal in magnitude and phase. Because they are in phase, {{zero sequence}} currents flowing through an n-phase network will sum to n times {{the magnitude of the}} individual zero sequence currents components. Under normal operating conditions this sum is small enough to be negligible. However, during large zero sequence events such as lightning strikes, this nonzero sum of currents can lead to a larger current flowing through the neutral conductor than the individual <b>phase</b> <b>conductors.</b> Because neutral conductors are typically not larger than individual <b>phase</b> <b>conductors,</b> a large zero sequence component can lead to the overheating of neutral conductors and to fires. One way to prevent large zero sequence currents is to use a delta connection which appears as an open circuit to zero sequence currents.|$|R

40|$|A great {{diversity}} of the nominal voltages in power networks can be explained based on the sizes {{and shape of the}} fed zone. To find the reason of such diversity, some assumptions should be made: the variation in parameters is continuous, the voltage is constant, the electricity consumers are spread uniformly, etc. To pass from continuous load to its discrete location, a discreteness factor is calculated for various shapes of the fed zone. The expression obtained for specific costs of the network shows that they decrease in the following cases: with voltage increasing as far as the costs of line construction are not rising too rapidly; with the load density and specific conductance of <b>phase</b> <b>conductor</b> increasing; when the consumers are located more sparsely. To reduce specific costs, an appropriate current density in <b>phase</b> <b>conductors</b> should be chosen.
