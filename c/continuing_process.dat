25|$|Most of Smith's {{stories are}} set in an era {{starting}} some 14,000 years in the future. The Instrumentality of Mankind rules Earth {{and goes on to}} control other planets later inhabited by humanity. The Instrumentality attempts to revive old cultures and languages in a process known as the Rediscovery of Man.

It may also be viewed as part of a <b>continuing</b> <b>process</b> begun by the Instrumentality, encompassing the whole cycle, where mankind is constantly at risk of falling back into bad old ways.|$|E
25|$|Public {{housing is}} {{overwhelmingly}} segregated {{between the two}} communities. Intercommunal tensions have forced substantial numbers of people to move from mixed areas into areas inhabited exclusively by one denomination, thus increasing the degree of polarisation and segregation. The extent of self-segregation grew very rapidly with {{the outbreak of the}} Troubles. In 1969, 69 per cent of Protestants and 56 per cent of Catholics lived in streets where they were in their own majority; as the result of large-scale flight from mixed areas between 1969 and 1971 following outbreaks of violence, the respective proportions had by 1972 increased to 99 per cent of Protestants and 75 per cent of Catholics. In Belfast, the 1970s were a time of rising residential segregation. It was estimated in 2004 that 92.5% of public housing in Northern Ireland was divided along religious lines, with the figure rising to 98% in Belfast. Self-segregation is a <b>continuing</b> <b>process,</b> despite the Northern Ireland peace process. It was estimated in 2005 that more than 1,400 people a year were being forced to move as a consequence of intimidation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Continued</b> <b>process</b> {{verification}} (CPV) is {{the collection}} and analysis of end-to-end production components and processes data to ensure product outputs are within predetermined quality limits. In 2011 the Food and Drug Administration published a report outlining best practices regarding business process validation in the pharmaceutical industry. <b>Continued</b> <b>process</b> verification is outlined in this report as the third stage in process validation. Its central purpose {{is to ensure that}} processes are {{in a constant state of}} control, thus ensuring final product quality. Central to effective CPV is a method with which to identify unwanted process inconsistencies in order to execute corrective or preventative measures. Once quality standards are set in place they must be monitored with regular frequency to confirm those parameters are being met. <b>Continued</b> <b>process</b> verification not only helps protect consumers from production faults, but business also see benefits in implementing a CPV program. Should product outputs not match target standards it can be very costly to investigate the problem source without existing CPV data.|$|R
50|$|A mouth bar is {{a bar in}} a {{river that}} is {{typically}} created {{in the middle of}} a channel in a river delta. It is created by a positive feedback between mid-channel deposition and flow divergence. As the flow diverges near the ocean, sediment settles out in the channel and creates an incipient mouth bar. As flow is routed around the incipient bar, additional sediment is deposited on the incipient bar. This <b>continued</b> <b>process</b> results in the formation of a full-fledged mouth bar, which causes the channel to bifurcate. This <b>continued</b> <b>process</b> leads to the characteristic fractal tree pattern found in some prograding river-dominated deltas.|$|R

[...] We must also realize that space expenditures must take their proper place within a rigorous system of national priorities. What we do in space from here on in must become a normal and regular part of our national life and must therefore be planned in conjunction with all of the other undertakings which are also important to us." [...] He then cancelled the last three planned Apollo lunar missions to place Skylab in orbit more efficiently and free money up for the design and construction of the Space Shuttle.|$|E
500|$|Thomas's verbal style {{played against}} strict verse forms, {{such as in}} the villanelle [...] "Do not go gentle into that good night". His images were {{carefully}} ordered in a patterned sequence, and his major theme was the unity of all life, the <b>continuing</b> <b>process</b> of life and death and new life that linked the generations. Thomas saw biology as a magical transformation producing unity out of diversity, and in his poetry sought a poetic ritual to celebrate this unity. He saw men and women locked in cycles of growth, love, procreation, new growth, death, and new life. Therefore, each image engenders its opposite. Thomas derived his closely woven, sometimes self-contradictory images from the Bible, Welsh folklore, preaching, and Sigmund Freud. Explaining the source of his imagery, Thomas {{wrote in a letter to}} Glyn Jones: [...] "My own obscurity is quite an unfashionable one, based, as it is, on a preconceived symbolism derived (I'm afraid all this sounds wooly and pretentious) from the cosmic significance of the human anatomy".|$|E
