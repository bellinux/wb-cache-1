40|$|To {{study the}} {{possibility}} of utilizing mixed construction waste and ultrafine tailings (CW&UT) as a backfilling aggregate that can be placed underground in a mine, physicochemical evaluation, proportioning strength tests, and pumpability experiments were conducted. It was revealed that mixed CW&UT {{can be used as}} a backfilling aggregate due to the complementarities of their physicochemical properties. In addition, as the results of the proportioning strength tests show, the compressive strength of a cemented CW&UT backfilling specimen cured for 28 days, with a mass fraction of 72 - 74 %, a cement-sand ratio of 1 : 12, and a CW proportion of 30 %, is higher than 1. 0 MPa, which meets the safety requirements and economic consideration of backfilling technology in many underground metal mines, and can also be enhanced with an increase in the cement-sand ratio. The results of the pumpability experiments show that <b>cemented</b> <b>backfilling</b> slurry based on CW&UT can be transported to the stope underground with a common filling pump, with a 16. 6 MPa maximum pressure, with the condition that the time of emergency shut-down is less than approximately 20 min.

40|$|Although a {{large number}} of {{previous}} researches have significantly contributed {{to the understanding of the}} quasi-static mechanical behavior of <b>cemented</b> tailings <b>backfill,</b> an evolutive porous medium used in underground mine cavities, very few efforts have been made to improve the knowledge on its response under sudden dynamic loading during the curing process. In fact, there is a great need for such information given that <b>cemented</b> <b>backfill</b> structures are often subjected to blast loadings due to mine exploitations. In this study, a coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical (THMC) -viscoplastic cap model is developed to describe the behavior of <b>cementing</b> mine <b>backfill</b> material under blast loading. A THMC model for <b>cemented</b> <b>backfill</b> is adopted to evaluate its behavior and evolution of its properties in curing processes with coupled thermal, hydraulic, mechanical and chemical factors. Then, the model is coupled to a Perzyna type of viscoplastic model with a modified smooth surface cap envelope and a variable bulk modulus, in order to reasonably capture the nonlinear and rate-dependent behaviors of the <b>cemented</b> tailings <b>backfill</b> under blast loading. All of the parameters required for the variable-modulus viscoplastic cap model were obtained by applying the THMC model to reproducing evolution of <b>cemented</b> paste <b>backfill</b> (CPB) properties in the curing process. Thus, the behavior of hydrating <b>cemented</b> <b>backfill</b> under high-rate impacts can be evaluated under any curing time of concern. The validation results of the proposed model indicate a good agreement between the experimental and the simulated results.

40|$|Returning waste {{material}} underground, as backfill, has been practiced {{for many years}} so as to improve the economical and environmental performance of underground mining operations. A specific type of backfill, {{which is used to}} fill mined areas that will not be exposed to further mining, is called hydraulic <b>backfill.</b> <b>Cemented</b> <b>backfill</b> has also been used to provide mechanical support for underground mining. Such backfill has allowed mining companies to extract more ore, while simultaneously improving working and environmental conditions. <b>Cemented</b> <b>backfill,</b> however, represents 50 to 85 percent of operating costs compared with the 5 to 10 percent that hydraulic backfill consumes. The objective of this thesis is to investigate use of sodium silicate as a partial or total replacement for <b>cement</b> in stabilised <b>backfill.</b> Sodium silicate is a viscous material that is usually used to activate pozzolanic materials such as slag and fly ash. The chemical compound has many applications, namely, in waste treatment, cement and other construction materials. In order to determine the influence of sodium silicate on backfill performance, a series of laboratory experiments were carried out on samples with different binder compositions, such as: cement; slag and cement; slag, cement and sodium silicate; and slag and sodium silicate. Additionally, the effects of mixing time and addition order on the backfill samples' performance were studied. The subsequent thesis focuses mainly on the strength of paste and slurry backfill samples containing sodium silicate in addition to the observation of a number of experimental variables, which include: pulp density (relative amount of water), curing time, and binder dosage. In order to investigate the overall suitability of sodium silicate for use in stabilised backfill, other properties such as porosity, elastic modulus, and trends of water release are also studied. The results of the research endeavour demonstrate that sodium silicate-fortified backfill materials behave favourably compared with <b>cemented</b> <b>backfills.</b> Sodium silicate, thus, has potential as a backfill binder or additive...|$|R

By analyzing experimental data on mix proportions and rheological parameters of <b>cemented</b> tailing <b>backfill</b> to determine the nonlinear relationships between rheological parameters (i. e., yield stress and viscosity) and mix proportions (i. e., solid concentrations, the tailing/cement ratio, the specific weight, and the slump), the study constructs a prediction model. The advantages of the combined model were as follows: First, through the PCA, original multiple variables were represented by two principal components (PCs), thereby leading to a 50 % decrease in input parameters in the BP neural network model, which covered 98. 634 % of the original data. Second, in comparison to conventional BP neural network models, the proposed model featured a simpler network architecture, a faster training speed, and more satisfactory prediction performance. According to the test results, any error between estimated and expected output values from the combined prediction model based on the PCA and the BP neural network was within 5 %, reflecting a remarkable improvement over results for BP neural network models with no PCA...|$|R

40|$|Backfill is {{commonly}} used in underground mines. The quality control of the backfill is a key step to ensure it meets the designed strength requirement. This is done through sample collection from the underground environment, followed by uniaxial compression tests to obtain the Uniaxial Compressive Strength (UCS) in the laboratory. When the cylindrical <b>cemented</b> <b>backfill</b> samples are axially loaded to failure, several failure modes can be observed and mainly classified into diagonal shear failure and axial split failure.

The results show that the UCS values obtained by diagonal shear failure are generally higher than those obtained by axial split failure for samples with the same recipe and curing time. This highlights the importance of making a distinction between the UCS values obtained by the two different modes of failure. Their difference in failure mechanism is explained.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the results of the shear strength (frictional strength) of cemented paste backfill-cemented paste <b>backfill</b> (CPB-CPB) and <b>cemented</b> paste backfill–rock wall (CPB-rock) interfaces. The frictional behaviors of these interfaces were assessed for the short-term curing times (3  d and 7  d) using a direct shear apparatus RDS- 200 from GCTS (Geotechnical Consulting & Testing Systems). The shear (friction) tests were performed at three different constant normal stress levels on flat and smooth interfaces. These tests aimed at understanding the mobilized shear strength at the CPB-rock and CPB-CPB interfaces during and/or after open stope filling (no exposed face). The applied normal stress levels were varied in a range corresponding to the usually measured in-situ horizontal pressures (longitudinal or transverse) developed within paste-filled stopes (uniaxial compressive strength, σc ≤  150  kPa). Results show that the mobilized shear strength is higher at the CPB-CPB interface than that at the CPB-rock interface. Also, the perfect elastoplastic behaviors observed for the CPB-rock interfaces were not observed for the CPB-CPB interfaces with low cement content which exhibits a strain-hardening behavior. These results are useful to estimate or validate numerical model for pressures determination in <b>cemented</b> <b>backfill</b> stope at short term.

40|$|Paste {{backfill}} used {{to provide}} ground support in underground mining is generated from full-stream tailings and is almost always placed underground with <b>cement.</b> For the <b>backfill,</b> both the rate of strength development and the final strength are important considerations for design, particularly when the backfill is subsequently exposed in the stope-mining sequence. There is strong evidence that strengths measured on specimens obtained from coring the in situ <b>cemented</b> <b>backfill</b> are much greater than laboratory-cured specimens with the same cement content. The paper reviews some of the experimental evidence showing {{that one of the}} major reasons for the different strength is the difference in effective stress acting on the backfill during curing. Laboratory specimens are (almost) always cured under zero total stress, so no effective stress develops. In contrast, backfill in a stope may cure under high effective stress, which develops due to either “conventional” consolidation in free-draining backfills, or to the so-called “self-desiccation” mechanism in fine-grained fills. Evidence is presented showing how the final strength is affected by applying stress to specimens at different stages of curing and at different rates. It is shown that a fully-coupled analysis of the filling behaviour is required to determine the appropriate effective stress regime to apply in curing laboratory specimens, where “fully-coupled” in this context means taking account of the interaction of consolidation/drainage rate, filling rate and cement hydration rate.

40|$|Mine {{backfilling}} is {{a process}} whereby mine tailings mixed with small amounts of cement are placed hydraulically into mined-out voids ('stopes') to stabilize the rockmass and allow full extraction of adjacent ore. A containment barricade is constructed to block the access point {{at the base of}} the stope, the design of which requires calculation of the total stress on the barricade during and following filling. For fine-grained <b>backfill</b> containing <b>cement,</b> the rate of development of stresses is governed by the rates of filling, consolidation, and cement hydration, each with its own timescale.

The paper describes a finite element (FE) model ('Minefill- 2 D') that can model these interactions, although only in a two-dimensional (plane-strain or axisymmetric) fashion.

Generally, the pressure coal takes 10 – 30  % of the recoverable reserves, and even all of the resources are ‘three-unders’ coal in some coal mines (Zhang et al. 2013). Most coal mines in eastern China have entered an exhausted stage when the resources are being mined out after decades of intensive mining (Miao et al. 2010 a; Miao and Qian 2009). Domestic and foreign scholars {{have done a lot of}} research and practice on it. Varieties of backfill mining methods such as solid <b>backfill,</b> pneumatic <b>backfill,</b> <b>cemented</b> paste <b>backfill</b> and high-water material backfill have been put forward (Tapsiev et al. 2009; Belem and Benzaazoua 2008; Seryakov et al. 2008; Donovan and Karfakis 2004; Rankine and Sivakugan 2007). One of the most extraordinary among them applied in China is the fully-mechanized backfill mining (FMBM) (Ju et al. 2009; Zhang and Miao 2006).|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} sources for waste {{production}} such as surface & underground mines, mineral processing plant and smelter refinery in Faryab chromite mine which has created serious hazards for environmental conditions. On the other hand, the massive and violent collapse of pillars {{which has been}} labelled as a domino failure occurred in this mine. These hazards were led to study the replacement of waste materials in underground spaces. Accordingly, the need for environmental protections and the stability of underground stopes in Faryab mine have necessitated ever stricter requirements for {{the introduction of a}} more environmental-friendly mining method which is labelled as green backfill. In this research for estimation of backfill required strength, a numerical model was developed. On the other hand, to reduce or eliminate <b>cement</b> from the <b>backfill</b> mixes, investigations were conducted regarding the replacement of cement by chromite slag {{for the first time as}} an alternative. Test results indicated that mecha-nical properties of backfill materials were improved by chromite slag. The results also showed that cement con-sumption will be reduced by at least 2 - 3 % using chromite slag as a binding agent. According to these results, it is possible to point out that chromite slag is a potential replacement material for Portland <b>cement</b> in <b>backfill</b> mixes. By using waste materials and chromite slag, the environmental conditions of Faryab mine will improve...|$|R
40|$|Enhancing the {{knowledge}} on the deformation behavior of <b>cemented</b> paste <b>backfill</b> (CPB) {{in terms of}} stress-strain relations and modulus of elasticity is significant for economic and safety reasons. In this paper, {{the effect of the}} initial backfill temperature on the CPB’s stress-strain behavior and modulus of elasticity is investigated. Results show that the stress-strain relationship and the modulus of elasticity behavior of CPB are significantly affected by the curing time and initial temperature of CPB. Additionally, the relationship between the modulus of elasticity and unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and the degree of hydration was evaluated and discussed. The increase of UCS and hydration degree leads to an increase in the modulus of elasticity, which is not significantly affected by the initial temperature...|$|R
40|$|Because {{backfill}} has occasionally {{collapsed into}} an active working area, posing a hazard to miners, engineers from the Spokane Research Laboratory of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and Hecla Mining Co. installed instruments in a <b>cemented,</b> <b>backfilled,</b> stope-ramp intersection at Hecla 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s Lucky Friday Mine, Mullan, ID. The {{purpose was to}} measure stress and strain changes in the backfill and reinforcing members during undercut mining. The instruments were monitored for 6 months while three successive cuts were mined below the intersection. Readings showed induced loads up to 3450 kPa (500 psi) in the backfill as stope walls converged 2. 5 to 12 cm (1 to 5 in). The backfill then deformed against {{the top and bottom}} plates of the 2 -m- (6 -ft-) long vertical rock bolts installed as reinforcement, producing loads to 177 kN (40, 000 lb) on the rock bolts. We hypothesize that a compressive zone was created in the backfill that allowed the backfill to remain stable as long as the compressive zones from adjacent rock bolts overlapped. This hypothesis is presented in graphical form. Of particular interest was the effect of loading on trusses installed to augment the vertical rock bolts and wire mesh typically installed in backfill. Data from the instruments indicate that wall closure perpendicular to the vein induced loads in truss legs parallel to the vein and in the rock bolt driven {{through the center of the}} truss, but, because they are designed to function under tension, truss legs perpendicular to the vein supplied in significant support as a result of compressional forces from wall closure. Based on this study, use of trusses was discontinued, and an alternative support system of wood beams and posts was installed as needed to ensure the safety of miners working beneath the backfill in stope-ramp intersections...|$|R
40|$|Known for its {{advantages}} in preventing geological and environmental hazards, <b>cemented</b> paste <b>backfill</b> (CPB) {{has become a}} topic of interest for scientists and mining engineers in recent decades. This paper {{presents the results of}} a study on the use of <b>cemented</b> super-fine tailings <b>backfill</b> (CSUTB) in an underground mine for control of surface subsidence. An analytical solution is developed based on the available model to calculate the required strength of backfill when in contact with non-cemented tailings (NCT). The effect of solid contents on the rheological properties of CSUTB is investigated. A reasonable mix proportion (RMP) of CSUTB is determined for Zhongguan Iron Mine (ZGIM) based on laboratory experiments. The validity of RMP in surface subsidence control is verified by a 3 D numerical model. The obtained results show that CSUTB requires higher strength when in contact with NCT than when in contact with orebody. Rheological characteristics, e. g., slump, fluidity, and bleeding rate of fresh CSUTB, decrease with higher solids content, of which values with a certain solids content can be determined by quadratic polynomial regression equations. RMP with a cement to tailings (c/t) ratio of 1 : 10 and a solids content of 70 % is recommended for ZGIM, as it shows favorable mechanical and rheological abilities. The deformation parameters (curvature, inclination, and horizontal deformation rate) obtained from numerical modeling are acceptable and lower than critical values, meaning CSUTB can feasibly be used with RMP in subsidence control...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis little {{literature}} {{studies the}} influence of <b>cemented</b> paste <b>backfill</b> (CPB) on ground water in diggings based on quality comparison between tailings slurry, thickener overflow, indoor soak sample, and seepage of underground paste. Firstly, determine the proportion of injurious ingredient filled underground. Secondly, investigate the amount of hazardous material which are leached from paste during the long time soaking. At last, the detection is made on underground seepage water, and also sample's quality is judged by multi-object decision. The result shows, 16. 74 % ∼ 79. 83 % of injurious material in the tailings slurry has been filled into the underground, however, the soak and seepage water {{turned out to be}} level I and II when synthetically evaluated by five indexes, which shows the CPB would not pollute the underground water, and it is safe, also feasible to adopt CPB in mining industry...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of the initial sulfate content on the {{properties}} of <b>cemented</b> paste <b>backfill</b> (CPB) made from coarse tailings has been investigated via mercury intrusion porosimetry. The combined effects of the sulfate content and curing time on the total porosity, pore size distribution, and unconfined compressive strength of the produced material were discussed. It was found that the specimens with an initial sulfate content of 5000 and 35, 000 ppm exhibited higher unconfined compressive strength, while the resulting fine porous structures characterized by pore radii of 10 – 400 and 1 – 10 μm significantly improved the mechanical properties of the CPB. In addition, an increase in the curing time decreased the overall pore volume in the radius range of 1 – 400 μm but increased the pore volume at pore radii less than 1 μm...|$|R
40|$|Gelfill (GF) {{is made of}} tailings, water, binder and {{chemical}} additives (Fillset, sodium silicate gel). The components of GF are combined and mixed {{on the surface and}} transported (by gravity and/or pumping) to the underground mine workings, where the GF can be used for both underground mine support and tailings storage. Thermal (T), hydraulic (H), and mechanical (M) properties are important performance criteria of GF. The understanding of these engineering properties and their evolution with time are still limited {{due to the fact that}} GF is a new <b>cemented</b> <b>backfill</b> material. In this thesis, the evolution of the thermal, hydraulic, mechanical, and microstructural properties of small GF samples are determined. Various binder contents of Portland cement type I (PCI) are used. The GF is cured for 3, 7, 28, 90, and 120 days. It is found that the thermal, hydraulic and mechanical properties are time-dependent or affected by the degree of binder hydration index. Furthermore, a relationship is found between the compressive strength and the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the GF samples. The unsaturated hydraulic properties of GF samples have also been investigated. The outcomes show that unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is influenced by the degree of binder hydration index and binder content, especially at low suction ranges. Simple functions are proposed to predict the evolution of air-entry values (AEVs), residual water content, and fitting parameters from the van Genuchten model with the degree of hydration index (α). Furthermore, two columns are built to simulate the coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) behaviour of GF under drained and undrained conditions. The obtained results from the GF columns are compared with the small samples. It is observed that the mechanical properties, hydraulic properties (suction and water content), and temperature development are strongly coupled. The magnitude of these THM coupling factors is affected by the size of the GF. The findings also show that the mechanical, hydraulic and thermal properties of the GF columns are different from samples cured in plastic moulds...|$|R
