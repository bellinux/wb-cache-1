50|$|Henry Pitkin and {{his brother}} James were jewelry makers in Hartford, Connecticut in the mid-1830s before their {{business}} failed {{as a result of}} the panic of 1837 and they turned their attention to the manufacture of watches.

5000|$|In lieu {{of weekly}} lessons, {{students}} {{were required to}} bring a <b>complete</b> <b>movement</b> of a major work. This usually demanded {{more than a week}} to prepare. Once a student felt ready to play this work, he or she had to sign up 10 days prior to the class meeting. The student was expected to have the concert ready and to be dressed accordingly. An accompanist was provided. An audience watched—comprised not only of students and parents, but also often of distinguished guests and prominent musicians. Auer arrived for the lesson punctually; everything was supposed to be in place by the time he arrived. During the lesson, Auer would walk around the room, observing, correcting, exhorting, scolding, shaping the interpretation. [...] "We did not dare cross the threshold of the classroom with a half-ready performance," [...] one student remembered.|$|E

However, perhaps due to personal issues, most notably a relationship with Amalie Heydweiller, which Christopher Fitfield speculates may have been the inspiration for the <b>completed</b> <b>movement,</b> Bruch found himself unable to <b>complete</b> the remaining <b>movements.</b> His decision to publish the work as a single movement concert piece, was based in part on the positive reception of his friends to the <b>completed</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|R

50|$|Deciding to {{temporarily}} abandon {{work on the}} opera {{to concentrate on the}} quartet, Dvořák <b>completed</b> the first <b>movement</b> in three days before abandoning the quartet around 10 October 1881 and starting again, this time in the key of C major on 25 October 1881. It is unclear why this happened; Terry Barfoot speculates that Dvořák felt the <b>completed</b> <b>movement</b> lacked tension. Geijtenbeek claims that Dvořák believed at the time {{that it was impossible to}} write a quartet in F major (Dvořák was to later write his 12th String Quartet in the same key). Writing in The Cambridge Companion to the String Quartet Jan Smaczny states that the <b>completed</b> <b>movement</b> is inferior to the C major quartet Dvořák completed.|$|R
5000|$|The third {{movement}} {{was at first}} labelled [...] "scherzo", despite being in [...] After a writing a few measures, Schubert left it aside, instead filling the page with counterpoint exercises testing the compatibility of the elements, {{in order to give}} the original opening a logical continuation. On another page, the movement is started again, this time materializing into a <b>complete</b> <b>movement</b> that became the finale of the symphony (according to Newbould). The movement is unconventional, either as a scherzo or as a finale. What was intended as the trio of a scherzo in ternary form in the first draft, became an episode later, while the piece was reshaped into a rondo. The movement is riddled with counterpoint (canons, invertible counterpoint, fugato, augmentation), and the two main themes (the original [...] "scherzo" [...] and [...] "trio" [...] themes) are superimposed {{at the end of the}} symphony. According to Newbould, several middle-sized sections of the movement have to be reshuffled in order to understand the movement, and that two of them were discarded (despite not explicitly deleted in the manuscript) as their material or function was overtaken by other.|$|E

5000|$|After Hüttenbrenner's {{release of}} the two <b>completed</b> <b>movements</b> of the Unfinished to Herbeck, some music historians and {{scholars}} took much trouble to [...] "prove" [...] the composition complete even in the truncated two-movement form, and indeed that abbreviated structure alone has captivated the listening public to consider {{it as one of}} Schubert's most cherished compositions. The fact that classical tradition was unlikely to accept that a symphony could end in a different key from the one it began in (with the B minor first movement and the E major finale by default incomplete), and the even more undeniable fact that Schubert had begun a third movement in B minor (leaving precisely 30 bars of fully orchestrated scherzo and 112 succeeding bars in short score), stands against the view that the two <b>completed</b> <b>movements</b> can legitimately stand alone.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Humans {{manage to}} adapt learned {{movements}} {{very quickly to}} new situations by generalizing learned behaviors from similar situations. In contrast, robots currently often need to re-learn the <b>complete</b> <b>movement.</b> In this paper, we propose a method that learns to generalize parametrized motor plans by adapting a small set of global parameters, called meta-parameters. We employ reinforcement learning to learn the required meta-parameters {{to deal with the}} current situation, described by states. We introduce an appropriate reinforcement learning algorithm based on a kernelized version of the reward-weighted regression. To show its feasibility, we evaluate this algorithm on a toy example and compare it to several previous approaches. Subsequently, we apply the approach to three robot tasks, i. e., the generalization of throwing movements in darts, of hitting movements in table tennis, and of throwing balls where the tasks are learned on several different real physical robots, i. e., a Barrett WAM, a BioRob, the JST-ICORP/SARCOS CBi and a Kuka KR 6...|$|E
40|$|The <b>complete</b> <b>movement</b> towards {{school reform}} {{is based upon}} the need to {{modernize}} the traditional educational systems in accordance with the latest requirements of the society. In other words, there is need for a high level of flexibility and adaptability in the system of education by means of including students into social life. Needless to say, these reforms also comprise reforms in the forms of educational work. It is also necessary to introduce new forms of teaching but it should not mean completely throwing away the old forms, but complementing them and maintaining their positive values. That is why the system class - grade is based on working groups that get tasks. In that way, relations student-student, student-teacher, student-group, and group-teacher are created and the social life of the class is strengthened. An inner dynamics among the members of the group is created in the form of dyadic relations (tandem work among students), triadic relations, etc...|$|E
40|$|The {{complexity}} in modeling human movement increases as the dimensionality of these movement grows. Since searching more precision and flexibility involves more {{variables in the}} model. Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP) have shown the ability to generate joint movements with high complexity. However, the problem remains in the interaction between several joints since DMP alone {{is not able to}} deal with it. To solve this problem a new model called autoencoded dynamic movement primitive (AE- DMP) is introduced in the work "Efficient movement representation by embedding DynamicMovement Primitives in Deep Autoencoders"[2]. The proposed approach uses autoencoder in order to find a representation of the movement in a latent space. Consequently, the DMPmodel is able to reconstruct the <b>complete</b> <b>movement.</b> In thisMaster Thesis we will study the implementation of this model and study its performance.
