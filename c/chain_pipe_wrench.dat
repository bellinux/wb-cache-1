25|$|The <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench,</b> or Stillson wrench, is an {{adjustable}} wrench used for turning soft iron {{pipes and fittings}} with a rounded surface. The design of the adjustable jaw allows it to rock in the frame, such that any forward pressure on the handle tends to pull the jaws tighter together. Teeth angled {{in the direction of}} turn dig into the soft <b>pipe.</b> The <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench</b> was invented by Daniel C. Stillson in 1869.|$|R
50|$|Daniel Chapman Stillson (March 25, 1826 - August 23, 1899) was an American inventor. He {{invented the}} modern {{adjustable}} <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench.</b>|$|R
50|$|This can be {{the result}} of objects, i.e. slips or <b>pipe</b> <b>wrenches,</b> being dropped down the hole lodging against the BHA.|$|R
50|$|Chain tongs: wrench with {{a section}} of chain, that wraps around {{whatever}} is being tightened or loosened. Similar to a <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 17 August 1888 the Swedish {{inventor}} Johan Petter Johansson (1853-1943) {{took his}} first patent on the adjustable <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench.</b> The Swedish Patent Office issued the patent (SE 5636) again in 1894. The idea emerged after he established his company Enk√∂pings Mekaniska Verkstad. Back then there was no standard on nut dimensions so each time a trades man was out on a job, he needed a trolley to take {{a whole set of}} fixed <b>pipe</b> <b>wrenches</b> with him. Johan Petter Johansson invented a tool that could grip nuts of different dimensions.|$|R
5000|$|The plumber wrench {{was invented}} in the year 1888 by Swedish {{inventor}} Johan Petter Johansson. His wrench shares some principles with both the Stillson-pattern <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench</b> and the rigid <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench.</b> Nevertheless, it is a decidedly different and improved tool. It allows plumbers to use the wrench rather than a pair of tongs to separate or join pipes. It is not widely known in North America. It is common in Europe, where it may be called a [...] "pipe wrench", [...] "Swedish wrench", or [...] "Swedish pattern wrench".|$|R
50|$|Hinged tools, such as pliers or tongs, are not {{generally}} considered wrenches in English, but exceptions are the plumber <b>wrench</b> (<b>pipe</b> <b>wrench</b> in British English) and Mole wrench (sometimes Mole grips in British English).|$|R
50|$|Cheater {{bars are}} usually used to free {{threaded}} pipe, screws, bolts, and other fasteners {{that are difficult}} to remove with a ratchet or <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench</b> alone. Cheater bars are also commonly used to operate valves.|$|R
50|$|The <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench</b> (US), Stillson wrench or Stillsons (UK) is an {{adjustable}} wrench/spanner used for turning soft iron {{pipes and fittings}} with a rounded surface. The design of the adjustable jaw allows it to lock in the frame, such that any forward pressure on the handle tends to pull the jaws tighter together. Teeth angled {{in the direction of}} turn dig into the soft pipe. They are not intended for use on hardened steel hex nuts or other fittings because they would ruin the head; however, if a hex nut is soft enough that it becomes rounded beyond use with standard <b>wrenches,</b> a <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench</b> is sometimes used to break the bolt or nut free. <b>Pipe</b> <b>wrenches</b> are usually sold in the following sizes (by length of handle): 10, 12, 14, 18, 24, 36, and 48 inches, although smaller and larger sizes are available as well. They are usually made of cast steel. Today, aluminium is also used to construct the body of the wrench, while the teeth and jaw remain steel. Teeth, and jaw kits (which also contain adjustment rings and springs) can be bought to repair broken wrenches, as this is cheaper than buying a new wrench.|$|R
25|$|In {{his spare}} time, Vedder is a surfer and active in surf-related {{conservation}} efforts, most notably The Surfrider Foundation. Vedder shows {{his support for}} environmental activism by sporting an Earth First! tattoo on his right calf. The logo is of a <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench</b> crossed with a stone hammer.|$|R
5000|$|In South Africa, {{the terms}} [...] "bobbejaan spanner" [...] and [...] "baboon spanner" [...] are {{commonly}} used, especially for large <b>pipe</b> <b>wrenches.</b> [...] "Bobbejaan" [...] is the Afrikaans {{term for a}} baboon. In Zimbabwe it was usually known by an Anglicized version of the Afrikaans name, [...] "bobbiejohn spanner".|$|R
50|$|In Commonwealth English (excluding Canada), spanner is the {{standard}} term. The most common shapes are called open-ended spanner and ring spanner. The term wrench is generally used for tools that turn non-fastening devices (e.g. tap <b>wrench</b> and <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench),</b> or {{may be used for}} a monkey wrench - an adjustable spanner.|$|R
50|$|Doiby Dickles has no superpowers but he's {{a skilled}} street fighter and driver. He used his taxi to drive Green Lantern to any {{location}} and/or during car chases. Sometimes, while fighting, {{he used a}} <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench</b> as a weapon which allowed him to knock out his enemies. He has a New York accent.|$|R
50|$|Ridgid {{tools are}} {{targeted}} at the plumbing, pipe fitting, construction, and HVAC trades. The brand {{is best known}} for its distinctive red <b>pipe</b> <b>wrenches,</b> but the company manufactures over 300 different types of tools. The company also sells power tools, largely made by TTI, and wet/dry vacs, made by parent company Emerson.|$|R
5000|$|On May 4, Janelle Lisa Cruz, 18, {{was found}} bludgeoned {{to death in}} her Irvine home. Her family was on {{vacation}} in Mexico {{at the time of}} the attack. A <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench</b> was reported missing by Cruz' stepfather and was thought to be the probable murder weapon. She had also been raped.|$|R
5000|$|March 30, 2014: A holdup and shootout {{occurred}} when the Martilyo Gang, a local criminal group specializing in robbing stores by smashing and stealing valuables using hammers, robbed a jewelry store using <b>pipe</b> <b>wrenches</b> instaed of hammers in the department store on the first floor. One suspect was arrested during the incident.|$|R
50|$|Irwin Industrial Tools is an American {{manufacturer}} and distributor of hand tools and power tool accessories. It {{is owned by}} Stanley Black & Decker. It {{is best known for}} producing Vise-Grip locking pliers. Additionally, it produces clamps, drill bits, taps and dies, screw extractors, bolt extractors, saw blades, <b>pipe</b> <b>wrenches,</b> screwdrivers, snips, and other construction tools.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, {{back in the}} restaurant, the {{waitress}} returns to find the woman missing. Believing that the woman has left without paying the bill, she angrily crumples and throws the woman's comic book into a bin. This makes the hero's two opposing racers reappear, armed with a large <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench.</b> The racers smash the looking glass with the <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench,</b> trapping {{the woman in the}} comic book. The hero punches one of the thugs and retreats with the woman into a maze of paper. Arriving at a dead end, he tears a hole in the paper wall so that the woman can escape as the menacing opposing racers close in on him. The woman, now back in the real world and found lying beside the bin to the surprise of restaurant guests and staff, retrieves the comic from the bin and runs home, where she attempts to smooth out the creases to learn what happens next.|$|R
5000|$|The {{length of}} the nipple is usually {{specified}} by the overall length with threads. It may have a hexagonal section in the center for wrench to grasp (sometimes {{referred to as a}} [...] "hex nipple"), or it may simply be made from a short piece of pipe (sometimes referred to as a [...] "barrel nipple" [...] or [...] "pipe nipple"). A [...] "close nipple" [...] has no unthreaded area; when screwed tightly between two female fittings, very little of the nipple remains exposed. A close nipple can only be unscrewed by gripping one threaded end with a <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench</b> which will damage the threads and necessitate replacing the nipple, or by using a specialty tool known as a nipple wrench (or known as an internal <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench)</b> which grips the inside of the pipe, leaving the threads undamaged. When the ends are of two different sizes it is called a reducer or unequal nipple.|$|R
50|$|A {{threaded}} pipe has a screw thread at {{one or both}} ends for assembly. Steel pipe is often joined with threaded connections; tapered threads are cut into {{the end of the}} pipe, sealant is applied in the form of thread-sealing compound or thread seal tape (also known as PTFE or Teflon tape) and the pipe is threaded into a threaded fitting with a <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench.</b>|$|R
50|$|When {{the handle}} of a <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench,</b> box wrench or ratchet is {{inserted}} into a cheater bar, the additional distance {{makes it possible to}} generate the required torque with the same amount of force being applied. However, the work done is the same with or without the cheater bar because the torque and angle of rotation needed to accomplish a particular task does not change.|$|R
50|$|A plumber wrench (or plumber's <b>wrench)</b> is a <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench</b> used {{to rotate}} {{plumbing}} pipes. It is adjusted to different pipe diameters by rotating the key ring (silver in the picture). Its {{advantage is that}} it grips with significant force without needing to engage a nut. However, if used carelessly, it can dent or break the pipe. It {{can also be used}} on nuts and other flat engagement points.|$|R
50|$|Bahco is a Swedish brand {{within the}} hand tool industry, {{which is now}} part of SNA Europe, part of Snap-on. Its roots go back to the {{industrial}} revolution in Sweden in the late eighteen hundreds, starting with innovations such as the <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench</b> and the modern adjustable wrench. Since then, the product range has expanded with a total assortment of products that today includes over 7000 hand tools.|$|R
40|$|Robot end {{effector}} designed for tightening tube couplers and for cutting tubes. Tool operable by simple movements and thus manipulated by technician wearing heavy protective clothing. Operates on principle of worm and pinion gear. Intended {{for use in}} building structures in space, {{end effector}} also used as hand tool for assembling truss structures for terrestrial buildings, tents, and oil rigs. Also used in place of <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench</b> in plumbing work...|$|R
5000|$|First-year {{students}} receive yellow hard hats during their orientation week which signify their recognition and adherence {{of the principles}} of engineering. During the week, they are also introduced to the society mascot, a 60" [...] (1,524mm) <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench</b> known simply as the TOOL (formerly the RIDGID TOOL). The TOOL is the centre of school spirit for engineering students, and it frequently appears at events organized by the engineering society.|$|R
50|$|Specialized {{plumbing}} tools include <b>pipe</b> <b>wrenches,</b> flaring pliers, <b>pipe</b> vise, {{pipe bending}} machine, pipe cutter, dies and joining {{tools such as}} soldering torches and crimp tools. New tools {{have been developed to}} help plumbers fix problems more efficiently. For example, plumbers use video cameras for inspections of hidden leaks or problems, they use hydro jets, and high pressure hydraulic pumps connected to steel cables for trench-less sewer line replacement.|$|R
50|$|Meditating on {{the present}} {{hopelessness}} of her situation, Bea laments coming aboard Serenity. Jayne comforts Bea, telling her Mal {{is a man of}} principle who fights to defend his beliefs. Left alone by Jayne, Bea accidentally accosts Early and offers him tea, failing to recognise him as a saboteur. Early secures the Serenity but fails to account for Kaylee, who strikes him down with a <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench,</b> binds him and threatens to torture him.|$|R
50|$|The monkey wrench, {{known as}} gas grips in the UK, is an {{adjustable}} wrench, a later American development of eighteenth-century English coach wrenches. It was {{popular in the}} {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} centuries but is now used only for heavier tasks, having been mostly replaced by the lighter and sleeker shifting adjustable spanner. The term monkey wrench is also used colloquially to refer to the <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench,</b> owing to their broadly similar shapes.|$|R
50|$|An {{eccentric}} {{toothed gear}} {{is mounted on}} a hexagonal shaft. The wrench is introduced inside the pipe (especially a close nipple, which has threading its entire length, and therefore no surface for an outside wrench). As the wrench is turned, the eccentric gear is forced to grip {{the inside of the}} pipe. As with a regular <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench,</b> the mechanism is such that the grip on the pipe increases with the torque applied on the wrench.|$|R
5000|$|Ricci was {{tortured}} to death, {{with some}} of his fingers having been removed and put inside bodily orifices. Pieces of his face were cut, his tongue was removed, and his penis was put into his mouth, which caused him to die of asphyxiation, according to the post-mortem. De Negri also pierced one of Ricci's eyes with the cut fingers, smashed his teeth and head with a <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench,</b> and [...] "washed" [...] his brain with dog shampoo.|$|R
50|$|The next morning, {{a reddish}} haze covers everything, {{and there are}} no signs of life, only piles of red dust and heaps of clothing. Unaware that {{anything}} strange has happened, Larry goes outside and is killed by a zombie wielding a <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench.</b> When Reggie goes looking for Larry, she encounters the zombie, but escapes. She heads home to find her sister. Because both Reggie and Sam spent the night shielded from cosmic effects by steel, they were saved from the comet's effects.|$|R
