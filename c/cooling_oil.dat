50|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>cooling</b> is {{commonly}} used to cool high-performance motorcycle engines that are not liquid-cooled. Typically, the cylinder barrel remains air-cooled in the traditional motorcycle fashion, but the cylinder head benefits from additional cooling. As there is already an oil circulation system available for lubrication, this oil is also piped to the cylinder head and used as a liquid coolant. Compared to an oil system used solely for lubrication, <b>oil</b> <b>cooling</b> requires additional <b>oil</b> capacity, a greater flow rate through the oil pump, and an <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> (or a larger cooler than normal).|$|R
25|$|From 1975 to 1976, Suzuki {{produced}} its RE5 single-rotor Wankel motorcycle.

50|$|Electric oil {{pumps are}} not used, again for reliability. Some 'turbo timer' {{electric}} auxiliary oil pumps are sometimes fitted to turbocharged engines. These are a second oil pump {{that continues to}} run after the engine has stopped, providing <b>cooling</b> <b>oil</b> to the hot bearings of a turbocharger for some minutes, whilst it cools down. These are supplementary pumps and do not replace the main, mechanical, oil pump.|$|E
50|$|The {{transformer}} station in Pessac, near Bordeaux, {{had long been}} recognized by the SOE as a target of particular interest but difficult to reach by air. The plan was to drop a team of saboteurs by parachute; they were {{to break into the}} {{transformer station}}, attach bombs and incendiaries with delay timers. The bombs would wreck the transformers and the incendiaries would set fire to the transformer <b>cooling</b> <b>oil</b> to complete the destruction.|$|E
50|$|Cast-resin power {{transformers}} encase the windings in epoxy resin. These transformers simplify installation {{since they}} are dry, without <b>cooling</b> <b>oil,</b> and so require no fire-proof vault for indoor installations. The epoxy protects the windings from dust and corrosive atmospheres. However, because the molds for casting the coils are only available in fixed sizes, {{the design of the}} transformers is less flexible, which may make them more costly if customized features (voltage, turns ratio, taps) are required.|$|E
50|$|The engine {{utilized}} a 90 degree V-angle to the crankshaft in {{preference to}} the taller but more common 60 degree design, with a compression ratio of 9.0:1. The crankshaft had crankpins offset 30 degrees {{to provide a}} low profile engine that fires smoothly and evenly. The block and cross flow pent roof cylinder heads with 24 valves are die-cast from aluminum alloy and the cylinder bores are lined with cast iron. The exhaust system uses equal length exhaust pipes connected to the Exhaust manifold to minimize scavenging resistance and maximum total exhaust efficiency.

50|$|Oils {{are used}} as {{coolants}} in <b>oil</b> <b>cooling,</b> for instance in electric transformers. Heat transfer oils are used both as coolants (see <b>oil</b> <b>cooling),</b> for heating (e.g. in oil heaters) and in other applications of heat transfer.|$|R
5000|$|... / - The {{sources of}} the main issues with the 6.0L were the {{in-block}} <b>oil</b> <b>cooler,</b> and the EGR <b>cooler</b> materials. The <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> {{is located in the}} valley of the engine block, underneath the cartridge oil filter set up. The sealed outer portion of the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> is submerged in engine oil, with coolant flowing through the center passages. Over time, the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> will develop small cracks in the aluminum tubes from the constant heating and cooling of the engine. This situation usually results in oil pushing it's way into the cooling system. The sludge created from the mixture of oil and coolant creates a high pressure environment in the EGR cooler (due to the viscosity change in the coolant), leading to cracking of the EGR cooler's coolant passages. Once the EGR cooler cracks, it begins to leak coolant into the intake system and is then routed into the engine's cylinders to be burnt. The burning of coolant in the cylinders then causes a steam buildup, thus increasing cylinder pressures and the stretching of the head bolts; which leads to head gasket failure. The early EGR coolers (2003-2004.5) were also susceptible to pre-mature failure without <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> issues, also resulting in head gasket failure.|$|R

50|$|Transformer oil, {{a type of}} {{insulating}} and <b>cooling</b> <b>oil</b> used in transformers {{and other}} electrical equipment, needs to be tested periodically {{to ensure that it}} is still fit for purpose. This is because it tends to deteriorate over time. Testing sequences and procedures are defined by various international standards, many of them set by ASTM. Testing consists of measuring breakdown voltage and other physical and chemical properties of samples of the oil, either in a laboratory or using portable test equipment on site.|$|E
