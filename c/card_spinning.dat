When using the PCI Express 2.0 compliant 8800 GT or 8800 GTS 512 in some motherboards with PCI Express 1.0a slots, the card would not produce any display image, but the computer would often boot (with the fan {{on the video}} <b>card</b> <b>spinning</b> at a constant 100%).

40|$|The {{work is a}} part of an R+D {{project in}} the BriteEuram 4478 programme. The {{following}} international consortia participated in the project: •	Tuchfabric Becker (D), (manufacturing company). •	HILFESA (E), (manufacturing company) •	Institut für Textiltechnik de la RWTH Aachen (D), (university research centre). •	INTEXTER (E) co-ordinator of the project, (university research centre). 	In the present work has been analysed, for the first time, the entire production line process in the spinning of carded wool. This production was optimised through the introduction of major innovations in the Ring spinning machine and OE-rotor. A complete new system of <b>card</b> <b>spinning</b> was designed and built, based on redesign of the pre-existing group of cards so as to achieve a new compact card (without web divisor) leading to the spinning machines. Although the overall design included modernisation of the OE-rotor as well as the ring spinning machine, the present paper only describes the work done on the ring spinning machine. Research on the OE-ROTOR was carried out at the Technical Textile Institute ITA of RWTH Aachen (Germany) and will be described in further publications. An effort was made throughout to assess the spinning alternatives examined {{from the point of view}} of the quality of the yarn produced. The specific structure of the yarn was also studies, as were the properties of the fabrics woven from these yarns. The intention throughout was to preserve the characteristic properties of the traditional product, made by the conventional carded wool process based on the traditional card assortment. The prototype fabrics were finished under industrial conditions, through the cooperation of participating companies.

An implicit assumption that all outcomes are equally likely underpins most randomization tools used in common games of chance (e.g. rolling dice, shuffling <b>cards,</b> <b>spinning</b> tops or wheels, drawing lots, etc.).

25|$|The systems {{described}} above are ideal types: real systems may present themselves as hybrids of those categories.

The beginning {{can be seen as}} process production, the middle as part production and the end again as process production: it's unlikely that a single company will keep all the stages of production under a single roof, therefore the problem of vertical integration and outsourcing arises. Most products require, from a supply chain perspective, both process production and part production.|$|R
