5|$|Although he {{immediately}} assumed {{use of his}} stepfather's surname, {{it was not until}} Clinton turned fifteen that he formally adopted the surname <b>Clinton</b> <b>as</b> a gesture toward his stepfather. Clinton said that he remembered his stepfather as a gambler and an alcoholic who regularly abused his mother and half-brother, Roger Clinton Jr., {{to the point where he}} intervened multiple times with the threat of violence to protect them.|$|E
5|$|Benedict Arnold then {{applied to}} {{accompany}} General Carleton, {{who was going}} to New York to replace <b>Clinton</b> <b>as</b> commander-in-chief; this request went nowhere. Other attempts all failed to gain positions within the government or the British East India Company {{over the next few years}} and he was forced to subsist on the reduced pay of non-wartime service. His reputation also came under criticism in the British press, especially when compared to that of Major André, who was celebrated for his patriotism.|$|E

After two months and many potential names considered, then-Governor David Paterson appointed Gillibrand as the interim Senator from New York. Gillibrand was required to run in a special election in 2010 for the permanent position, which she won with 63% of the vote. She was re-elected to a full six-year term in 2012 with 72% of the vote, the highest margin for any statewide candidate in New York.|$|E
5|$|In the 2012 presidential election, Republican nominee Mitt Romney earned over 50% of {{the vote}} in the precinct that {{included}} Trump Tower, one of two Manhattan voting precincts to do so (the other being the precinct that included the Waldorf Astoria New York hotel).

In 2016, within the precinct that contained Trump Tower, 200 people voted for <b>Clinton</b> <b>as</b> opposed to 95 for Trump.|$|E

5|$|Robin Lynn Raphel (born 1947) is an American former diplomat, ambassador, CIA {{analyst and}} an expert on Pakistan affairs. Until November 2, 2014, she served as {{coordinator}} for non-military assistance to Pakistan, carrying on the work of the late Richard Holbrooke, whose AfPak team she joined in 2009.

She later served as U.S. Ambassador to Tunisia from November 7, 1997 to August 6, 2000, during Clinton's second term in office.|$|E
5|$|The race {{began in}} November 1998 when four-term {{incumbent}} New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced his retirement. Both the Democratic Party and Republican Party sought high-profile candidates {{to compete for}} the open seat. By early 1999 Clinton and Mayor of New York City Rudolph Giuliani were the likely respective nominees. Clinton and her husband, President Bill Clinton, purchased a house in Chappaqua, New York, in September 1999; she thereby became eligible for the election, although she faced characterizations of carpetbagging since she had never resided in the state before. The lead in statewide polls swung from Clinton to Giuliani and back to <b>Clinton</b> <b>as</b> the campaigns featured both successful strategies and mistakes as well as dealing with current events. In late April and May 2000, Giuliani's medical, romantic, marital, and political lives all collided in a tumultuous four-week period, culminating in his withdrawing from the race on May 19.|$|E

5|$|Through {{his opinion}} pieces and {{political}} fundraising, Ijaz has advocated for {{the integration of}} Muslims into the American political mainstream. He raised significant amounts for various Democratic Party causes during the 1990s when President Clinton had {{paved the way for}} minority communities to become more active in U.S. politics, encouraging fellow Pakistani and Muslim Americans to join his fundraising efforts along the way. In 1996, Ijaz raised or contributed more than $525,000 for the Clinton-Gore re-election campaign, bringing Ijaz into close proximity with Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>as</b> well as other Clinton administration national security officials with whom he would later engage on Sudan, Kashmir and Pakistan's nuclear program.|$|E
5|$|When Reagan {{left office}} in 1989, he held an {{approval}} rating of sixty-eight percent, matching those of Franklin D. Roosevelt, and later Bill <b>Clinton,</b> <b>as</b> the highest ratings for departing presidents {{in the modern}} era. He was the first president since Dwight D. Eisenhower to serve two full terms, after a succession of five prior presidents did not, some under unusual circumstances. Although he had planned an active post-presidency, Reagan disclosed in 1994 {{that he had been}} diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease earlier that year. He appeared publicly for the last time at the funeral of Richard Nixon. He died ten years later in 2004 at the age of 93. Reagan had the third-longest life out of all the presidents, after Gerald Ford and George H. W. Bush. An icon among Republicans, he is viewed favorably in historian rankings of U.S. presidents, and his tenure constituted a realignment toward conservative policies in the United States.|$|E
