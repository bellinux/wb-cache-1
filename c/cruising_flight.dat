25|$|The Avro 720 was {{intended}} {{to have been a}} high performance aircraft that would have utilised mixed propulsion to accomplish this, using a rocket engine to achieve quick acceleration and a high top speed while a more compact jet engine would have been used during more mundane <b>cruising</b> <b>flight.</b> The termination of the aircraft had been partially due to its choice in powerplant, Avro having opted to utilise the in-development Armstrong Siddeley Screamer rocket engine, which used liquid oxygen as oxidant and kerosine fuel; major questions were posed over the oxidant's practicality under operational situations.|$|E
500|$|Test {{pilot and}} naval aviator Captain Eric Brown {{evaluated}} the first prototype and found [...] "the controls in <b>cruising</b> <b>flight</b> were very heavy and, in fact, lateral control was so solid that I could barely move the ailerons {{with one hand}} at [...]" [...] In bad weather a pilot circling a carrier while waiting to land would {{have been forced to}} fly such a wide circuit that he could not always keep the carrier in sight. The later prototypes had ailerons boosted by hydraulic power and artificial feel to the stick from a spring, as an interim measure but Brown found [...] "the second prototype was much less the pleasant aircraft to fly as the stick continually hunted either side of neutral and there was no build up of stick force with increase in speed." [...] The Spearfish lacked any sort of stall warning, which would have been a problem in operational use as the stall and approach speeds were fairly close. For the landing, the aircraft proved quite docile.|$|E
2500|$|Question Mark {{took off}} from Van Nuys at 7:26a.m. on New Years Day 1929 with Eaker at the controls, {{carrying}} only [...] of fuel to save takeoff weight. Aboard the Question Mark, either Halverson or Quesada {{did most of the}} piloting during <b>cruising</b> <b>flight</b> while Eaker monitored the throttles for smoothest engine performance. A log was kept by the flight officer (co-pilot) and dropped to the ground daily, and Eaker was responsible for winding the barograph, an instrument that continuously recorded altitude and time as documentary evidence for the records.|$|E
5000|$|The RLV-TD was {{developed}} with an objective to test various aspects such as hypersonic <b>flight,</b> autoland, powered <b>cruise</b> <b>flight,</b> hypersonic flight using the air-breathing engine propulsion and [...] "Hypersonic Experiment". Series of five RLV-TD test flights are planned by ISRO.|$|R
50|$|Variable-incidence {{winglets}} {{were first}} {{mounted on the}} craft's sides in 1960 to the 30 pre-series units. These wings provide approximately 20% of the lift required during <b>cruise</b> <b>flight.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The 700E burns [...] {{per hour}} in <b>cruise</b> <b>flight</b> at 4,750 rpm. The {{recommended}} {{time between overhauls}} is 1000 hours, although this {{is expected to be}} increased as experience is gained.|$|R
2500|$|Beginning {{with the}} B-36D, Convair added {{a pair of}} General Electric J47-19 jet engines {{suspended}} {{near the end of}} each wing; these were also retrofitted to all extant B-36Bs. Consequently, the B-36 was configured to have ten engines, six radial propeller engines and four jet engines, leading to the B-36 slogan of [...] "six turnin' and four burnin'". The B-36 had more engines than any other mass-produced aircraft. The jet pods greatly improved takeoff performance and dash speed over the target. In normal <b>cruising</b> <b>flight,</b> the jet engines were shut down to conserve fuel. When the jet engines were shut down, louvers closed off the front of the pods to reduce drag and to prevent ingestion of sand and dirt. The jet engine louvers were opened and closed by the flight crew in the cockpit, whether the B-36 was on the ground or in the air. The two pods with four turbojets and the six piston engines combined gave the B-36 a total of [...] for short periods of time.|$|E
2500|$|The {{nose section}} {{contained}} the V-12 Hispano-Suiza 12Nb engine, which produced 462kW (620hp) at 2,000rpm and drove a two blade propeller. A chin radiator was mounted below the fuselage firewall, with a long, prominent fairing behind it. The engine mountings were extended rearwards beyond the pilot's cabin {{to join the}} steel tubes in the wings. [...] The cabin, fitted with dual controls, was accessed via glazed triangular doors, which provided sufficient sideways vision for <b>cruising</b> <b>flight.</b> A hatch, provided with a small windscreen was used for take-offs and landings by raising the pilot's seat. [...] The navigator sat alongside the pilot on a drop seat. His space, 2m (79in) long and 1m (39in) wide, had side and roof windows for sightings. Internally, the rear part of the fuselage, mounted {{on the other end}} of the wing's four steel tubes, provided a space for the crew to rest during a long flight. The aerodynamically clean, tapered, elliptical rear section was built around four longerons, with a plywood skin and outer fabric sheath. [...] The tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage and the fin and rudder together were roughly elliptical. [...] The fixed, tailwheel undercarriage had split axles hinged to the bottom of the fuselage, with the wheels and main legs enclosed in narrow, wide chord fairings.|$|E

40|$|The {{gross thrust}} of an {{experimental}} airplane {{was determined by}} each method using the same flight maneuvers and generally the same data parameters. Coefficients determined from thrust stand calibrations {{for each of the}} three methods were then extrapolated to <b>cruise</b> <b>flight</b> conditions. The values of total aircraft gross thrust calculated by the three methods for <b>cruise</b> <b>flight</b> conditions agreed within + or - 3 percent. The disagreement in the values of thrust calculated by the different techniques manifested itself as a bias in the data. There was little scatter (0. 5 percent) for the thrust levels examined in flight...|$|R

50|$|Although the <b>cruise</b> <b>flight</b> of the {{scramjet}} based Mach eight vehicle seems feasible, {{the fuel}} consumption during acceleration requires a large fuel fraction, severely affecting gross take-off weight. Initial studies of a first-stage rocket ejector concept gave poor range with large take-off mass.|$|R
50|$|On April 6, 1993, China Eastern Airlines Flight 583, an MD-11 {{went into}} severe {{oscillations}} when {{a crew member}} accidentally deployed the slats during <b>cruise</b> <b>flight</b> over the Pacific Ocean near the Aleutian Islands. Two passengers were seriously injured and later died.|$|R
25|$|Turbocharged {{aircraft}} often {{occupy a}} performance range between that of normally aspirated piston-powered aircraft and turbine-powered aircraft. Despite the negative points, turbocharged aircraft fly higher for greater efficiency. High <b>cruise</b> <b>flight</b> also allows {{more time to}} evaluate issues before a forced landing must be made.|$|R
50|$|In aviation, {{endurance}} is {{the maximum}} {{length of time}} that an aircraft can spend in <b>cruising</b> <b>flight.</b> Endurance is different from range, which {{is a measure of}} distance flown. For example, a typical sailplane exhibits high endurance characteristics but poor range characteristics.|$|E

40|$|We propose an {{approach}} to detecting anomalies from aircraft <b>cruise</b> <b>flight</b> data. The detection {{is based on a}} model learned from the historical data of a fleet of aircraft. For a variety of <b>cruise</b> <b>flight</b> conditions with and without turbulence, we validate the approach using a FOQA dataset generated by a NASA flight simulator. We identify a regression model that maps the flight conditions and aircraft control inputs into accelerations (linear and rotational). Anomalies are detected as outliers that exceed the scatter caused by turbulence and the modeling error. The detection method is related to multivariable statistical process control. Sensor offset anomalies that are a fraction of a degree in flight surface position and {{a small percentage of the}} experienced sensor range are reliably detected from the data collected under light turbulence conditions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a nonlinear gust-attenuation controller to stabilize velocities, attitudes and angular rates of a fixed-wing {{unmanned aerial vehicle}} (UAV) {{in the presence of}} wind gusts. The proposed controller aims to achieve a steady-state flight condition such that the host UAV can avoid airspace collision with other UAVs during the <b>cruise</b> <b>flight.</b> Based on the typical UAV model capturing flight aerodynamics, a nonlinear Hinf controller is developed with rapid response property in consideration of actuator constraints. Simulations are conducted for the Shadow UAV to verify performance of the proposed controller. Comparative studies with the proportional-integral derivative (PID) controllers demonstrate that the proposed controller exhibits great performance improvement in a gusty environment, making it suitable for integration into the design of flight control systems for <b>cruise</b> <b>flight</b> with safety guarantees...|$|R
50|$|In {{propeller}} aircraft an overspeed {{will occur}} if the propeller - ordinarily connected {{directly to the}} engine - is forced to turn too fast by high speed airflow while the aircraft is in a dive, moves to a flat pitch in <b>cruising</b> <b>flight</b> due to a governor failure or feathering failure, or becomes decoupled with the engine.|$|E
50|$|It is agile {{and a good}} climber, but {{slightly}} underperforms {{compared to}} its competitors in <b>cruising</b> <b>flight,</b> especially at higher speeds. The later DG-303 version with a new wing profile and winglets was developed that delivers higher performance at low to medium speeds plus increased aileron response. A fully aerobatic version (the Acro) was also sold, stressed for +7/-5g.|$|E
50|$|From 1959 to 1972 {{at least}} 500 units were built for various general-transport, utility, {{firefighting}} and flying-crane duties, {{the last two}} sub-types not being fitted with the large fixed wings, which in other versions bear part of the lift in <b>cruising</b> <b>flight</b> and thus enable higher speeds to be attained. The twin nose wheels and large low-pressure main wheels do not retract.|$|E
2500|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determines that}} the {{probable}} {{cause of the}} EgyptAir flight 990 accident is the airplane's departure from normal <b>cruise</b> <b>flight</b> and subsequent impact with the Atlantic Ocean {{as a result of}} the relief first officer's flight control inputs.

This paper begins with building a proper model capturing flight aerodynamics of UAVs. Then a nonlinear controller is developed with gust attenuation and rapid response properties.
