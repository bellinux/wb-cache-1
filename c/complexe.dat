500|$|Ravel was not by {{inclination}} a teacher, {{but he gave}} {{lessons to}} a few young musicians he felt could benefit from them. Manuel Rosenthal was one, and records that Ravel was a very demanding teacher when he thought his pupil had talent. Like his own teacher, Fauré, he was concerned that his pupils should find their own individual voices and not be excessively influenced by established masters. He warned Rosenthal {{that it was impossible}} to learn from studying Debussy's music: [...] "Only Debussy could have written it and made it sound like only Debussy can sound." [...] When George Gershwin asked him for lessons in the 1920s, Ravel, after serious consideration, refused, on the grounds that they [...] "would probably cause him to write bad Ravel and lose his great gift of melody and spontaneity". The best known composer who studied with Ravel was probably Ralph Vaughan Williams, who was his pupil for three months in 1907–08. Vaughan Williams recalled that Ravel helped him escape from [...] "the heavy contrapuntal Teutonic manner... <b>Complexe</b> mais pas compliqué was his motto." ...|$|E
