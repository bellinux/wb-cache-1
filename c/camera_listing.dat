The difference in LIR from the other <b>cameras</b> <b>listed</b> in Table  5 shows that |Δ y_SSC | is larger than |Δ x_SSC |. This is probably because the distributions of detected limb points tend to be longer in the Y-direction than the true ellipse.|$|R

Our system is capable of image capture at video rate. This is critical in applications that require three-dimensional tracking. We obtain dense stereo depth data by projecting a light pattern of frequency modulated sinusoidally varying intensity onto the scene, thus increasing the local discriminability at each pixel and facilitating matches. In addition, we make most of the camera view areas by converging them at a volume of interest. Results indicate {{that we are able}} to extract stereo depth data that are, on the average, less than 1 mm in error at distances between 1. 5 to 3. 5 m away from the <b>cameras.</b> <b>List</b> of Figures Fig. 1 The 4 -camera system [...] . 2 Fig. 2 Relationship between the baseline, disparity, focal length, and depth [...] . 3 Fig. 3 A ve [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|Reception of the Nikon D3X by {{independent}} reviewers {{has been very}} positive, with reservations centered on just a few disadvantages, especially its high price. Imaging Resource concludes that the D3X produces the highest image quality of any camera they have tested to date. Digital Photography Review likewise concludes that the resolution and image detail is stunning, probably the best of any digital SLR camera on the market, including the closest competitor from Canon, the EOS-1Ds Mark III. Nikon claims the D3X is a competitor to medium-format digital backs, a claim supported both by testing [...] and by many D3X users who report on their experiences online. On the down side, Digital Photography Review notes that the D3X performs worse than the D3 in terms of speed (frame rate) and high ISO performance. Like many reviewers, they also point out the most obvious disadvantage of the D3X: the <b>camera</b> <b>lists</b> for $8000, though the present market price is much lower.|$|R

40|$|We have designed, developed, and {{assessed}} a novel preclinical {{positron emission tomography}} (PET) imaging system named ModPET. The system was developed using modular gamma cameras, originally developed for SPECT applications at the Center for Gamma Ray Imaging (CGRI), but configured for PET imaging by enabling coincidence timing. A pair of cameras are mounted on a exible system gantry that also allows for acquisition of optical images such that PET images can be registered to an anatomical reference. Data is acquired in a super list-mode form where raw PMT signals and event times are accumulated in events <b>lists</b> for each <b>camera.</b> Event parameter estimation of position and energy is carried out with maximum likelihood methods using careful camera calibrations accomplished with collimated beams of 511 -keV photons and a new iterative mean-detector-response-function processing routine. Intrinsic lateral spatial resolution for 511 -keV photons {{was found to be}} approximately 1. 6 mm in each direction. Lists of coincidence pairs are found by comparing event times in the two independent <b>camera</b> <b>lists.</b> A timing window of 30 nanoseconds is used. By bringing the 4. 5 inch square cameras in close proximity, with a 32 -mm separation for mouse imaging, a solid angle coverage of ∼ 75 % partially compensates for the relatively low stopping power in the 5 -mm-thick NaI crystals to give a mea- sured sensitivity of up to 0. 7 %. An NECR analysis yields 11, 000 pairs per second with 84 μCi of activity. A list-mode MLEM reconstruction algorithm was developed to reconstruct objects in a 88 x 88 x 30 mm field of view. Tomographic resolution tests with a phantom suggest a lateral resolution of 1. 5 mm and a slightly degraded resolution of 2. 5 mm in the direction normal to the camera faces. The system can also be configured to provide (99 m) Tc planar scintigraphy images.

50|$|This {{allows the}} animators and {{directors}} {{to work out}} any screenplay, <b>camera</b> positioning, shot <b>list</b> and timing issues that may exist with the current storyboard. The storyboard and soundtrack are amended if necessary, and a new animatic may be created and reviewed with the director until the storyboard is perfected. Editing the film at the animatic stage can avoid animation of scenes that would be edited out of the film. A few minutes of screen time in traditional animation usually equates to months of work for a team of traditional animators to manually draw and paint all those frames, meaning that all that labor (and salaries already paid) {{will have to be}} written off if the final scene simply does not work in the film's final cut. In the context of computer animation, storyboarding helps minimize the construction of unnecessary scene components and models, just as it helps live-action filmmakers evaluate what portions of sets need not be constructed because they will never come into the frame.|$|R
40|$|The Constellation program (CxP) has {{developed}} a list of 50 sites of interest on the Moon which will be targeted by the LRO narrow angle <b>camera.</b> The <b>list</b> has also been provided to the M~ team to supplement their targeting list. This list does not represent a "site selection" process; rather {{the goal was to}} find "representative" sites and terrains to understand the range of possible surface conditions for human lunar exploration to aid engineering design and operational planning. The list compilers leveraged heavily on past site selection work (e. g. Geoscience and a Lunar Base Workshop - 1988, Site Selection Strategy for a Lunar Outpost - 1990, Exploration Systems Architecture Study (ESAS) - 2005). Considerations included scientific, resource utilization, and operational merits, and a desire to span lunar terrain types. The targets have been organized into two "tiers" of 25 sites each to provide a relative priority ranking in the event of mutual interference. A LEAG SAT (special action team) was established to validate and recommend modifications to the list. This SAT was chaired by Dr. Paul Lucey. They provided their final results to CxP in May. Dr. Wendell Mendell will organize an on-going analysis of the data as they come down to ensure data quality and determine if and when a site has sufficient data to be retired from the list.
