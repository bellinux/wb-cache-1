5|$|In most cases, {{the owner}} and {{the driver of the}} chariot were {{different}} persons. In 416 BC, the Athenian general Alcibiades had seven chariots in the race, and came in first, second, and fourth; obviously, he could not have been racing all seven chariots himself. Philip II of Macedon also won an Olympic chariot race in an attempt to prove he was not a barbarian, although if he had driven the chariot himself he would likely have been considered even lower than a barbarian. The poet Pindar did praise the <b>courage</b> <b>of</b> Herodotes of Thebes, however, for driving his own chariot. This rule also meant that women could win the race through ownership, despite the fact that women were not allowed to participate in or even watch the Games. This happened rarely, but a notable example is the Spartan Cynisca, daughter of Archidamus II, who won the chariot race twice. Chariot racing was a way for Greeks to demonstrate their prosperity at the games. The case of Alcibiades indicates also that chariot racing was an alternative route to public exposure and fame for the wealthy.|$|E
5|$|Torajans perform dances {{on several}} occasions, most often during their {{elaborate}} funeral ceremonies. They dance {{to express their}} grief, and to honour and even cheer the deceased person because {{he is going to}} have a long journey in the afterlife. First, a group of men form a circle and sing a monotonous chant throughout the night to honour the deceased (a ritual called Ma'badong). This is considered by many Torajans to be the most important component of the funeral ceremony. On the second funeral day, the Ma'randing warrior dance is performed to praise the <b>courage</b> <b>of</b> the deceased during life. Several men perform the dance with a sword, a large shield made from buffalo skin, a helmet with a buffalo horn, and other ornamentation. The Ma'randing dance precedes a procession in which the deceased is carried from a rice barn to the rante, the site of the funeral ceremony. During the funeral, elder women perform the Ma'katia dance while singing a poetic song and wearing a long feathered costume. The Ma'akatia dance is performed to remind the audience of the generosity and loyalty of the deceased person. After the bloody ceremony of buffalo and pig slaughter, a group of boys and girls clap their hands while performing a cheerful dance called Ma'dondan.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Courage Compétition {{began running}} their updated C60 Hybrid, whilst Pescarolo also updated their C60; {{the two teams}} were the fastest and second fastest {{respectively}} at the Paul Ricard test session. At the LMES season opener, which was the 1000km of Spa, the Courage-entered car, driven by Cochet, Christian Vann and Alexander Frei was eliminated in a pit-lane accident, whilst the Pescarolo entry, driven by Bouillon, Collard and Comas finished second. For the 24 Hours of Le Mans, both teams entered two cars; Courage entered Frei, Vann and Dominik Schwager in one car, and Cochet, Shinji Nakano and Bruce Jouanny in the other, whilst Pescarolo ran Collard, Boullion and Comas {{in one of their}} C60s, with Ayari, Hélary and Sébastien Loeb in the other. One car from each team finished; Collard, Boullion and Comas took second for Pescarolo, whilst Schwager, Frei and Vann finished eighth for Courage. Both teams reverted to single-car entries for the 1000km of Monza, which Collard and Boullion won for Pescarolo; the Gounon/Vann/Frei combination in the Courage finished sixth overall, and fourth in the LMP1 category. For the 1000 km of Silverstone, it was Frei, Vann and Cochet, driving for Courage, who were the fastest C60; they took 14th, and 13th in class, whilst Collard and Boullion had problems and finished 34th, and 17th in class. The 1000km of Nürburgring saw Boullion and Collard take fourth for Pescarolo, whilst Frei and Cochet took eighth for Courage. At the final round of the season, which was the 1000 km of Istanbul, Collard and Boullion took another victory for Pescarolo, whilst the <b>Courage</b> <b>of</b> Gounon and Frei took 21st overall, and eighth in class. This result meant that Pescarolo had won their first ever team's championship, whilst Courage finished seventh.|$|E
