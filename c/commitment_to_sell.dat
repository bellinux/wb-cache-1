25|$|The {{danger of}} {{overpricing}} {{is also an}} important consideration. If a stock is offered to the public at a higher price than the market will pay, the underwriters may have trouble meeting their <b>commitments</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> shares.

This could result in losses for investors, many of whom being the most favored clients of the underwriters. Perhaps the best known example of this is the Facebook IPO in 2012.|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the optimal auction-one that maximizes the seller 2 ̆ 7 s {{expected}} revenue-can be implemented using a standard auction format with a suitably chosen reserve price. This reserve price is above the seller 2 ̆ 7 s value of retaining the object and the mechanism requires a <b>commitment</b> not <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> the object below the reserve. This commitment is what makes the reserve valuable to the seller. However, in practice, a reserve price commits the seller <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> the object if the reserve is reached, but does not commit her to withhold the object from sale if bidding falls short of the reserve. In this note we investigate whether reserve prices remain valuable for the seller when she may negotiate with the highest bidder if the reserve is not met. We show that the value of the reserve price may be completely undermined if the seller is a sufficiently weak bargainer. (c) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
