5|$|Along with Senators Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch, Clinton was a {{force behind}} {{the passage of the}} State Children's Health Insurance Program in 1997, a federal bill that gave state support to <b>children</b> <b>whose</b> <b>parents</b> could not provide them health {{coverage}} and conducted outreach efforts on behalf of enrolling children in the program once it became law. She promoted nationwide immunization against childhood diseases and encouraged older women to get a mammogram for breast cancer screening, with coverage provided by Medicare. She successfully sought to increase research funding for prostate cancer and childhood asthma at the National Institutes of Health. The First Lady worked to investigate reports of an illness that affected veterans of the Gulf War, which became known as the Gulf War syndrome.|$|E
5|$|By the show's tenth {{anniversary in}} 1979, 9 million American {{children}} under the age of six were watching Sesame Street daily. Four out of five children had watched it over a six-week period, and 90% of children from low-income inner-city homes regularly viewed the show. According to a 1993 survey conducted by the US Department of Education, out of the show's 6.6 million viewers, 2.4 million kindergartners regularly watched it. 77% of preschoolers watched it once a week, and 86% of kindergartners, first-, and second-grade students had watched it once a week before starting school. The show reached most young children in almost all demographic groups, most significantly economically disadvantaged children; 88% of children from low-income families and 90% of both African-American and Latino children watched the show before entering kindergarten. Over 80% of children from all minority language groups watched it before starting school. Children from the poorest communities were most likely to be regular viewers, as were younger children. <b>Children</b> <b>whose</b> <b>parents</b> did not read to them regularly were less likely to be regular viewers, and children of highly educated parents stopped viewing earlier than children from disadvantaged households.|$|E

25|$|Kindergarten {{has been}} shown to improve school {{readiness}} in children at risk. Children attending a kindergarten were less likely to have impaired speech or impaired motor development. Only 50% of <b>children</b> <b>whose</b> <b>parents</b> did not graduate from school are ready for school at age six. If such children were enrolled in a high-quality three-year Kindergarten programme, 87% were ready for school at age six. Thus Kindergarten helps to overcome unequal opportunities.|$|E
25|$|The {{plan was}} for {{education}} of children in three successive stages corresponding with three types of schools: primary schools, which all children, regardless of their parents' financial ability, {{would be able to}} attend for at least three years; intermediate schools, for students who excelled in primary school, as well as for <b>children</b> <b>whose</b> <b>parents</b> are willing and able to pay for it; and the university, for students whose parents were willing to pay.|$|E
25|$|Children whose {{families}} receive welfare, <b>children</b> <b>whose</b> <b>parents</b> {{dropped out of}} school, children of teenage parents, children raised by a lone parent, children raised in crime-ridden inner-city neighbourhoods, children who have multiple young siblings, and children who live in overcrowded substandard apartments {{are at risk of}} poor educational achievement in Germany. Often these factors go together, making it very hard for children to overcome the odds. A number of measures have been assessed to help those children reach their full potential.|$|E

25|$|Undocumented {{immigrants}} in mixed status families tend {{to work in}} jobs that do not provide employee based health insurance and/or employed in occupations that pay off the books. Moreover, we can also expect that poor noncitizen <b>children</b> <b>whose</b> <b>parents</b> lack job-based coverage have lower rates of participation than poor citizen children of U.S. citizens. The lack of insurance for citizen children in mixed-status families means that these children {{are less likely to}} receive timely care for acute conditions, and less likely to have their chronic conditions diagnosed and appropriately managed.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, the American Academy of Pediatrics {{stated in}} Pediatrics: On {{the basis of}} this {{comprehensive}} review of the literature regarding the development and adjustment of <b>children</b> <b>whose</b> <b>parents</b> are the same gender, as well as the existing evidence for the legal, social, and health benefits of marriage to children, the AAP concludes that it is {{in the best interests of}} children that they be able to partake in the security of permanent nurturing and care that comes with the civil marriage of their parents, without regard to their parents’ gender or sexual orientation.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to giving support and reassurance during distress, another important function of caregiving within intimate relationships is {{the provision of}} support for a relationship partner's personal growth, exploration, and goal strivings. In attachment theory, this type of support is called providing a secure base and is postulated to encourage the relationship partner's confident, autonomous exploration of the environment outside of the attachment relationship. This phenomenon was originally observed in young children; <b>children</b> <b>whose</b> <b>parents</b> showed more intrusiveness {{were less likely to}} engage in play and exploration in a novel environment.|$|E
