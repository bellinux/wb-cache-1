40|$|Work {{is ongoing}} to {{characterize}} the dimensional variability of steel <b>casting</b> <b>features.</b> Data are being collected from castings produced at representative Steel Founders` Society of America foundries. Initial results based on more than 12, 500 production casting feature measurements are presented for carbon and low alloy steel castings produced in green sand, no-bake, and shell molds. A comprehensive database of casting, pattern, and feature variables has been developed so that {{the influence of the}} variables on dimensional variability can be determined. Measurement system analysis is conducted to insure that large measurement error is not reported as dimensional variability. Results indicate that the dimensional variability of production <b>casting</b> <b>features</b> is less than indicated in current US (SFSA) and international (ISO) standards. Feature length, casting weight, parting line and molding process all strongly influence dimensional variability. Corresponding pattern measurements indicate that the actual shrinkage amount for <b>casting</b> <b>features</b> varies considerably. This variation in shrinkage will strongly influence the ability of the foundry to satisfy customer dimensional requirements...|$|E

40|$|The {{dimensional}} {{capabilities of}} production aluminum castings are described. More than 480 production <b>casting</b> <b>features</b> {{have been evaluated}} for jobbing shop aluminum castings made in green sand and permanent molds. A comprehensive database of casting, feature and process descriptors has also been developed, so that the influence of these factors on casting dimensional variability can be evaluated. Measurement system analysis techniques {{have been used to}} ensure that the dimensional variability measured was not influenced by excessive measurement system errors. The dimensional variability of both green sand and permanent-mold castings is less than is suggested by International Standards Organization (ISO) casting dimensional tolerance specifications. Both feature length and casting weight significantly influenced the dimensional variability of aluminum castings produced in permanent molds. The dimensional repeat-ability of aluminum castings is also compared to rile dimensional repeat-ability of iron and steel castings from similar studies...|$|E
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand for dimensionally-accurate, high-quality, low-cost castings developed and delivered in ever shorter time. These requirements {{can no longer be}} achieved by process improvements alone, and require early planning, starting from the product design stage itself. Unfortunately, product designers have very little knowledge of process capabilities, which is necessary to design process-friendly castings. In this paper, we present a framework for generating automatic suggestions for product design improvement, driven by casting domain knowledge base. The domain knowledge is modeled using XML, a self-describing language suitable for use over the Internet. It captures distilled experience in the form of rules regarding various <b>casting</b> <b>features</b> (mainly junctions and holes), in terms of feature geometry, material and process parameters leading to various casting defects (such as shrinkage porosity and cold shuts). For this purpose, various casting junctions and their variations have been classified in a systematic manner. Illustrated suggestions are linked to the knowledge base and are triggered when a particular rule is violated. The entire system is explained using an industrial case study...|$|E

40|$|An elasto-visco-plastic {{deformation}} model predicts {{stresses and}} distortions in a low-carbon steel <b>casting.</b> <b>Features</b> {{of the model}} include rate and hardening effects, temperature-dependent properties, and pressure-dependent deformation in the mushy zone. A volume-averaging technique considers the multiple phases during solidification and is used to formulate the conservation equations, which (due to a weak link between temperatures and deformations) are decoupled and solved sequentially using commercial software. Temperature fields are calculated first using MAGMAsoft (MAGMAsoft, MAGMA GmbH, Kackerstrasse 11, 52072 Aachen, Germany) and then exported to a finite element software package, ABAQUS (Abaqus/Standard, Abaqus, Inc., Providence, RI, 2006), which predicts stresses and distortions. In order to simulate the conditions encountered in an industrial casting process, predicted temperatures and distortions are matched with experimental data from in situ casting trials. Preliminary simulations {{do not agree with}} the experimental distortions, which suggest that stress-strain data from mechanical tests (from which the mechanical properties were estimated) does not accurately characterize the material behavior of a casting during solidification and cooling. The adjustments needed to match measured and predicted distortions provide valuable insight to the effect a solidified microstructure has on its mechanical properties...|$|E
40|$|Casting {{customers}} {{continue to}} demand tighter dimensional tolerances for <b>casting</b> <b>features.</b> The foundry then places {{demands on the}} patternshop to produce more accurate patterns. Control of all sources of dimensional variability, including measurement system variability in the foundry and patternshop, is important to insure casting accuracy. Sources of dimensional casting errors will be reviewed, focusing {{on the importance of}} accurate patterns. The foundry and patternshop together must work within the tolerance limits established by the customer. In light of contemporary pattern tolerances, the patternshop must review its current measurement methods. The measurement instrument must have sufficient resolution to detect part variability. In addition, the measurement equipment must be used consistently by all patternmakers to insure adequacy of the measurement system. Without these precautions, measurement error can significantly contribute to overall pattern variability. Simple robust methods to check the adequacy of pattern measurement systems are presented. These tests will determine the variability that is contributed by the measurement equipment and by the operators. Steps to control measurement variability once it has been identified are also provided. Measurement system errors for various types of measurement equipment are compared to the allowable pattern tolerances, that are established together by the foundry and patternshop...|$|E
40|$|The {{groundwater}} {{potential of}} the Makurdi sandstone was investigated at Anyoga Eddi Adum East during February-March 1998. Fifteen hundred meters of EM 34 - 3 surveying was undertaken, using a 20 m inter-coil spacing, as were two resistivity soundings. Three boreholes were drilled: two deep exploratory boreholes and one shallow cored observation borehole. Two boreholes (BGS 36 and BGS 37) were completed with screen and casing; BGS 38 contained little water and was therefore backfilled. BGS 36 and BGS 37 were test pumped; during these exercises water samples were obtained for hydrochemical analysis. The following conclusions are made from the results obtained: The Makurdi Sandstone at Anyoga Eddi Adum East comprises interbedded sandstones and mudstones. Sandstone layers up to 4 m thick are present. The sandstones are fine to medium grained, well cemented, feldspathic and frequently bioturbated. The sandstones contain interbedded thin mudstone beds that often show load <b>casting</b> <b>features.</b> The mudstone can be soft and is often shaley and carbonaceous. Thin sandstone, siltstone and limestone layers occur interbedded within the mudstone sequence. Where sandstone occurs at shallow depths, it has been weathered. Within the top few metres, feldspar has been leached increasing the inter-granular permeability and porosity; kaolinite clay is also present. At slightly greater depths, secondary silicate deposition is present, which produces very hard and dense siliceous sandstone layers with negligible inter-granular permeability. Where predominately mudstone is present at shallow depths, it has been weathered to olive-green illite-smectite rich clay (similar to Edumoga). The aquifer properties of the Makurdi Sandstone at Anyoga are disappointing. Groundwater was only found where significant sandstone occurred within the weathered zone. The inter-granular permeability of the sandstone is low, {{the majority of the}} water found in the two successful probably supplied by slow seepage from the sandstone. The yield from neither borehole is sufficiento sustain a hand pump. A hand dug well constructed through the weathered zone to the fractures below would be the most appropriate technology for abstracting groundwater. The storage coefficient at Anyoga was typical of a confined aquifer (0. 0001). The exploratory boreholes could be kept open to routinely measure water levels within the aquifer to monitor the sustainability. The electrical conductivity measured using the EM 34 - 3 varied from 10 - 30 mmhos/m. The lower measurements were associated with sandstone in the weathered zone, while the higher measurements indicated more mudstone within the weathered zone. Therefore, low EM 34 - 3 readings are the best targets for groundwater. Resistivity soundings could also distinguish the sandstone from the mudstone. It is recommended that a more detailed study is made of the weathered zone of the sandstone to discover more about how and where the hard siliceous layers are likely to occur (e. g. in valleys or on ridges). A diamond-coring bit would be required to obtain samples...|$|E
