40|$|Many {{species of}} stomatopod {{crustaceans}} have multiple spectral classes of photoreceptors in their retinas. Behavioral evidence {{also indicates that}} stomatopods are capable of discriminating objects by their spectral differences alone, Most animals use only two to four different types of photoreceptors in their color vision systems, typically with broad sensitivity functions, but the stomatopods apparently include eight or more narrowband photoreceptor classes for color recognition. It is also known that stomatopods use several colored body regions in social interactions. To examine why stomatopods may be so 2 ̆ 7 concerned 2 ̆ 7 with color, we measured the absorption spectra of visual pigments and intrarhabdomal filters, and the reflectance spectra {{from different parts of}} the bodies of several individuals of the gonodactyloid stomatopod species, Gonodactylus smithii. We then applied a model of multiple dichromatic channels for color encoding to examine whether the finely tuned color vision was specifically co-evolved with their complex <b>color</b> <b>signals.</b> Although the eye design of stomatopods seems suitable for detecting <b>color</b> <b>signals</b> of their own, the detection of <b>color</b> <b>signals</b> from other animals, such as reef fishes, can be enhanced as well. Color vision in G. smithii is therefore not exclusively adapted to detect its own <b>color</b> <b>signals,</b> but the spectral tuning of some photoreceptors (e. g. midband Rows 2 and 3) enhances the contrast of certain <b>color</b> <b>signals</b> to a large enough degree to make co-evolution between color vision and these rather specific <b>color</b> <b>signals</b> likely.

5000|$|The {{modulation}} technique {{of the color}} subcarrier is quadrature amplitude modulation (QUAM [...] ) both in PAL and NTSC systems. The amplitude of the <b>color</b> <b>signal</b> represents the saturation of the color and the phase lag of the <b>color</b> <b>signal</b> {{with respect to a}} certain reference which is called colorburst represents the hue; i.e., each phase lag is assigned for a different color hue.

50|$|Additionally, for compatibility, it is {{required}} to use no more bandwidth than the monochrome signal alone; the <b>color</b> <b>signal</b> has to be somehow inserted into the monochrome signal, without disturbing it. This insertion is possible because the spectrum of the monochrome TV signal is not continuous (for most typical video content), hence empty space exists which can be utilized. This typical lack of continuity results from the discrete nature of the signal, which is divided into frames and lines. (Strictly speaking, monochrome video does use the full spectrum, if arbitrary and unconstrained movement of subjects and/or cameras is permitted. Therefore, all of these color systems compromise luma quality to some extent {{in exchange for the}} addition of color—i.e. all of these color signals look worse at some time or other than they would if the <b>color</b> <b>signal</b> were absent.) Analog color systems differ by the way in which infrequently used space in the frequency band of the signal is used. In all cases, the <b>color</b> <b>signal</b> is inserted {{at the end of the}} spectrum of the monochrome signal, where it causes less visual distortion (only affecting fine detail) in the uncommon case that the monochrome signal had significant frequency components overlapping the <b>color</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
40|$|Bright and/or {{conspicuous}} {{displays of}} color constitute a major, functionally diverse class of animal signals. Despite {{the complexities of}} color production, however, researchers have been largely pre-occupied with understanding how a few select pigments, such as carotenoids, contribute to the honest signaling of mate quality. As a consequence, the field has largely overlooked a large family of non-pigment-based colors-the so-called 'structural colors'-and also tended to understate the true complexities of color (which often results from the concerted effects of diverse suites of pigments and reflecting structures acting upon incident light). More recent research has explored the true complexity of <b>color</b> <b>signals</b> from both functional and evolutionary perspectives. Mechanistic studies have identified precise suites of pigments, characterized myriad structural color-producing devices, and defined the relative roles of pigments and structures in determining patterns of signal variation. Behavioral and ecological studies have discovered hitherto unprecedented levels of variation, across a mechanistically and visually diverse breadth of <b>color</b> <b>signals.</b> This variation {{has been linked to}} salient selective contexts, such as mate selection, male-male competition and predator avoidance. Evolutionary theoreticians have, in turn, drawn upon these knowledge advances to expand existing <b>color</b> <b>signaling</b> hypotheses, and to generate new hypotheses for future evaluation. In this chapter we outline these advances, drawing upon exemplar cases across fishes, insects and birds, and with a focus on the role of surface structures in determining evolutionarily relevant properties of <b>color</b> <b>signals.</b> 30 page(s...|$|R

50|$|For {{backward}} compatibility with black-and-white television, NTSC uses a luminance-chrominance encoding system invented in 1938 by Georges Valensi. The three <b>color</b> picture <b>signals</b> {{are divided into}} Luminance (derived mathematically from the three separate <b>color</b> <b>signals</b> (Red, Green and Blue)) which {{takes the place of}} the original monochrome signal and Chrominance which carries only the color information. This process is applied to each color source by its own Colorplexer, thereby allowing a compatible color source to be managed as if it was an ordinary monochrome source. This allows black-and-white receivers to display NTSC <b>color</b> <b>signals</b> by simply ignoring the chrominance signal. Some black-and-white TVs sold in the US after the introduction of color broadcasting in 1953 were designed to filter chroma out, but the early B&W sets did not do this and chrominance could be seen as a 'dot pattern' in highly colored areas of the picture.|$|R
50|$|S-Video (also {{known as}} {{separate}} video and Y/C) is a signaling standard for standard definition video, typically 480i or 576i.

50|$|Separating RGB <b>color</b> <b>signals</b> into luma and {{chrominance}} {{allows the}} bandwidth of each {{to be determined}} separately. Typically, the chrominance bandwidth is reduced in analog composite video by reducing the bandwidth of a modulated color subcarrier, and in digital systems by chroma subsampling.|$|R
50|$|DG is {{a problem}} both in NTSC and PAL. But PAL (phase {{alternating}} at line rate) is more sensitive {{to this kind of}} distortion. PAL averages phase differences of <b>color</b> <b>signal</b> in two consecutive lines.|$|E
50|$|To {{solve the}} problem of {{differential}} phase distortion in PAL system, the polarity of both the colorburst and the <b>color</b> <b>signal</b> are reversed in each consecutive frame. So in one frame the phase of the colorburst leads and in the second frame the phase of the <b>color</b> <b>signal</b> leads. However, if there is DP distortion in the system, the shift caused by DP has always the same polarity, thus the overall shift is more than the original in one frame and less than the original in the second frame by the same amount. The average of two frames yields the original phase difference and thus the color.|$|E
5000|$|The {{colors were}} created by filling the pixel with a repeating 4-bit binary pattern {{in such a manner}} that each bit group fit within one cycle of the colorburst {{reference}} signal.

There are two equivalent grey shades as 5 (0101) is equivalent to 10 (1010) based on how the colors mix together; the [...] "on" [...] bits are polar opposites of each other on the quadrature <b>color</b> <b>signal,</b> so they cancel each other and display as grey.|$|E

40|$|SummaryWhether {{fundamental}} visual attributes, such as color, motion, and shape, {{are analyzed}} separately in specialized pathways {{has been one}} of the central questions of visual neuroscience [1 – 3]. Although recent studies have revealed various forms of cross-attribute interactions, including significant contributions of <b>color</b> <b>signals</b> to motion processing [4 – 9], it is still widely believed that color perception is relatively independent of motion processing. Here, we report a new color illusion, motion-induced color mixing, in which moving bars, the color of each of which alternates between two colors (e. g., red and green), are perceived as the mixed color (e. g., yellow) even though the two colors are never superimposed on the retina. The magnitude of color mixture is significantly stronger than that expected from direction-insensitive spatial integration of <b>color</b> <b>signals</b> [10, 11]. This illusion cannot be ascribed to optical image blurs, including those induced by chromatic aberration [12, 13], or to involuntary eye movements of the observer. Our findings indicate that <b>color</b> <b>signals</b> are integrated not only at the same retinal location, but also along a motion trajectory. It is possible that this neural mechanism helps us to see veridical colors for moving objects by reducing motion blur, as in the case of luminance-based pattern perception [14 – 19]...|$|R
50|$|Colorburst is {{an analog}} video, {{composite}} video signal generated by a video-signal generator used to keep the chrominance subcarrier synchronized in a <b>color</b> television <b>signal.</b> By synchronizing an oscillator with the colorburst at the back porch (beginning) of each scan line, a television receiver is able to restore the suppressed carrier of the chrominance (<b>color)</b> <b>signals,</b> and in turn decode the color information. The most common use of colorburst is to genlock equipment together as a common reference with a vision mixer in a television studio using a multi-camera setup.|$|R
