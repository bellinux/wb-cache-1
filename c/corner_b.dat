Red color means high accuracy and dark blue means low accuracy. Marker-based optical tracking systems are widely used in augmented reality, medical navigation and industrial applications. We propose {{a model for the}} prediction of the target registration error (TRE) in these kinds of tracking systems by estimating the fiducial location error (FLE) from two-dimensional errors on the image plane and propagating that error to a given point of interest. We have designed a set of experiments in order to estimate the actual parameters of the model for any given tracking system. We present the results of a study which we used to demonstrate the effect of different sources of error. The method is applied to real applications to show the usefulness for any kind of augmented reality system.

30|$|Saliency is {{determined}} by bottom-up features (e.g. color contrast) and top-down factors (e.g. the relevance of color to the task). It guides attention during visual search. Moreover, target saliency can result from similarity relations, e.g. a red bird (target) in front of green leaves (distractors) will be highly salient because the target is dissimilar from the distractor while the distractors are highly similar to each other. In other words, the Guided Search Model (based on saliency) and the Attentional Engagement Theory (based on similarity relations) predict similar results for many search conditions. However, their predictions differ when comparing points b and d of the search continuum (see Fig.  1). Due {{to the fact that}} the Guided Search Model predicts a decreasing search efficiency as more items show the same characteristic in a task-relevant feature (e.g. red fruit in a search for red apples), steeper reaction time slopes are assumed for <b>corner</b> <b>b</b> than for corner d in Fig.  1. The opposite is predicted by Attentional Engagement Theory, according to which search rates increase with decreasing DDS and thus the requirement of the rejection of an increasing number of heterogeneously colored distractor items/groups in the process of visual search. We aim to transfer the knowledge from the above-mentioned basic research to the applied setting of visual search on mobile touch devices and to test the two predictions against each other. Hence, with the help of colored app icons, the predictions of the models were tested for four extreme points (compare corners a, c, b, and d of Fig.  1) of the visual search continuum.|$|E
30|$|Study 1 {{aimed at}} {{transferring}} effects of TDS {{as well as}} DDS to app icons on mobile touch devices. For this purpose, reaction times were analyzed depending on similarity (between colored app icons), set size (number of app icons), and target app presence. As expected, grouping of similar app icons occurred and enabled an efficient app selection. Hence, our results mirror those from basic (laboratory) visual search studies. Regarding the different predictions of the Guided Search Model and the Attentional Engagement Theory, the results support the prediction of the Guided Search Model (compare <b>corner</b> <b>b</b> and d in Fig.  3 to Fig.  1). When the target is highly similar to the distractors (high TDS), the Guided Search Model predicts a weaker guidance of attention by a basic attribute (e.g. color), the more distractors carry this attribute. In the same scenario, the Attentional Engagement Theory predicts more efficient grouping and rejection with increasing distractor similarity (i.e. leading to steeper reaction time slopes for corner d than b in Fig.  1). When realizing point b, we created an extreme variant of high TDS and high DDS in which all icons shared the same color group. Thus, grouping by color could not offer any relevant information for target–distractor discrimination. Thus, the present pattern of results is not fully compatible with the prediction of Attention Engagement Theory. Instead, {{the results suggest that}} priority map models of the search process such as Guided Search are more appropriate to predict search performance in app icon search.|$|E

40|$|Coordinating {{our actions}} {{with those of}} others is a {{fundamental}} task in every day life and yet the process of its initiation, development, and termination remains relatively unexplored. While it is generally agreed upon that humans require {{a certain period of}} time to establish a wellfunctioning joint action behavior, it is an open question whether humans can switch back to individual behavior instantaneously. In our experiment we investigated the coordination parameters in the transition from individual behavior to joint action behavior and vice versa. We employed a large-scale (18 x 13 m), immersive VR environment in which two subjects, equipped with head-mounted-displays and wireless connected laptops, can be tracked simultaneously (VICON tracking system) and interact with each other and additional objects. In this behavioral experiment two subjects were instructed to walkthrough a dynamically generated maze without colliding with the walls. In the first condition (Baseline Condition) subjects walked through the maze individually (20 min). In the second condition (Joint Action Condition) subjects had to transport a stretcher (length= 2. 5 m) through the maze together (40 min). In the final condition (Follow Condition) the stretcher was simply removed, and the subject continued walking (10 min) while remaining a constant distance of 2. 5 m. Between the first and second condition subjects received a 15 minute break; however between the second and third no pause was made since the immediate aftereffects of the second condition were to be measured in the third condition. Path characteristics were specified by a) path length around each <b>corner,</b> <b>b)</b> the minimal distance to the corner, and c) a symmetry parameter which determines how much a subject’s path deviates from an ideal, symmetric track. Compared to the Baseline Condition, participants in the Joint Action Condition increased as expected their path length and their individual distance to the corner, and deviated from a symmetric path due to the extended physical boundaries. Furthermore, all three path characteristics in the Follow Condition showed greater similarities to the Joint Action than to the Baseline Condition. Even without the necessity for cooperation subjects continued to exhibit a behavior similar to the Joint Action Condition. This effect can be interpreted as an aftereffect to the adaptation of the subjects to the joint task, in which compensation was developed gradually. After prolonged joint action participation, subjects require a particular amount of time or exercise to return to independent walking behavior...|$|E
40|$|Most current {{studies on}} 'African' and/or 'Black' {{literature}} in South Africa appear {{to ignore the}} contradictions underlying the valuative concepts 'African' and 'Black'. This (Jamesonian) unconsciousness has led, primarily, to a situation where writers and critics assume generally that the concepts 'African' and 'Black' are synonymous and interchangeable. This study argues that such an attitude either unconsciously represses {{an awareness of the}} distinctive aspects of the worldview connotations of these concepts or deliberately suppresses them. The theoretical and pragmatic approach which this study adopts to explore the distinctive aspects of the worldview connotations of these concepts takes the form, initially, of a critique of such assumptions and their connotations. It is argued that any misconceptions about the relations between the concepts 'African' and 'Black' can only be elucidated through a rigorous and distinct definition of each of these concepts and the respective world views embodied in them. Each of the variables of these definitions is also examined thoroughly through an application of, inter alia, Frederick Jameson's 'dialectical' theory of textual criticism, Pierre Macherey's 'theory of literary production' and also through the post-colonial notions of 'hybridity' and 'syncreticity' propounded by Bill Ashcroft et. al (eds). In this way the study examines the dialectical interplay between, for instance, such oppositional notions as 'African' and 'Western' (place-conscious), 'Black' and 'White' (race-conscious), and other forms of ideological 'dominance' and 'marginality' reflected in the 'African' and/or 'Black' writers' motivations for the acquisition, appropriation and uses of the language of the 'other' (i. e. English) and its literary discourse in South Africa, Africa and elsewhere in the world. A close textual reading of the stories in Mothobi Mutloatse's (ed) Forced Landing, Mbulelo Mzamane's (ed) Hungry Flames underlies an examination of the processes of anthologisation and their implications of aesthetic collectivism, reconstruction and world view monolithicism which repress the distinctive world outlooks of the stories in these anthologies. The notions of aesthetic monolithicism implicit in each of these anthologies are interrogated via the editors' truistic assumptions about the organic nature of the relations between the concepts 'African' and 'Black'. The notion of a monolithic 'African' and 'Black' aesthetic is further decentred through a close textual reading of the uses of the 'African' and 'Black' valuative concepts in the short story collections The Living and the Dead and In <b>Corner</b> <b>B</b> by Es'kia (formerly Ezekiel) Mphahlele. The humanistic pronouncements in Mphahlele' s critical and short story texts suggest various ways of resolving the racial demarcations in both the 'Black' and 'White' South African literary formations. According to Mphahlele, a predominant racial consciousness inherent in the racial capitalist mode of economic production has deprived South African literature and culture an opportunity of creating a national humanistic and 'Afrocentric' form of aesthetic consciousness. The logical consequence of such a deprivation has been that the racial impediments toward the formation of a single national literature will have to be dismantled before the vision of a humanistic and 'Afrocentric' aesthetic can be realised in South Africa. The dismantling of both the 'Black' and 'White' monolithic forms of consciousness may pave the way toward the attainment of a synthetic and place-centred humanistic aesthetic. Such a dismantling of racial monolithicism will, hopefully, stimulate a debate on the question of an equally humanistic economic mode of production...|$|E

40|$|In {{robotic vision}} using laser-radar measurements, noisy data on convex sets with corners are derived {{in terms of}} the set's support function.
