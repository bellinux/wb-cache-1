40|$|The {{relationship}} between plasma adiponectin {{and severity of}} coronary artery disease (CAD) in 683 cases of suspected CAD from north-east China was determined. Cases were divided into four groups, as follows: group 1, no stenosis; group 2,> 50 % stenosis of one vessel; group 3,> 50 % stenosis of two vessels; group 4,> 50 % stenosis of three or more vessels. Group 1 was classified as a non-CAD group (control) and groups 2, 3 and 4 were classified as <b>CAD</b> <b>groups.</b> Plasma adiponectin levels were significantly correlated with coronary artery stenosis and were lower in the <b>CAD</b> <b>groups</b> than in the non-CAD group. Adiponectin concentration decreased from group 2 to group 4, but this difference was not significant.

40|$|Background: The apo B/apo A-I ratio {{represents}} {{the balance between}} athero-genic particles, rich in apo B, and the antiatherogenic ones, apo A-I rich. This study investigated the association between atherosclerotic diseases in different anatomical sites and apo B/apo A-I ratio. Methods: Lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins A-I and B were assessed in 30 subjects with coronary artery dis-ease (CAD), 26 with ischemic stroke (IS), 30 with peripheral arterial obstructive disease (PAOD), and 38 healthy subjects (controls). Results: HDLc and Apo A-I were significantly lower in PAOD and <b>CAD</b> <b>groups,</b> respectively, than in other groups. Significantly higher levels of triglycerides were observed for <b>CAD</b> and PAOD <b>groups</b> than for controls. Apo B was significantly higher in IS group than in control and PAOD groups. The apo B/apo A-I ratio showed significantly high-er in <b>CAD</b> and IS <b>groups</b> when compared to control and PAOD groups (p < 0. 001). Conclusion: The apo B/apo A-I ratio was important for identifying an increased trend for coronary and cerebral atherosclerosis.

We aimed to assess the association between the CAE and the neutrophil–lymphocyte (N/L) ratio. Consecutive eligible patients (n 181) were divided into 3 groups: patients with CAE, those with newly diagnosed coronary artery disease (CAD), and those with a normal coronary angiogram. The N/L ratio and mean platelet volume (MPV) were measured as part of the automated complete blood count. There were no statistically significant differences in N/L ratio and MPV between the CAE and the <b>CAD</b> <b>groups.</b> The N/L ratio and MPV were significantly higher in patients in both CAE and <b>CAD</b> <b>groups</b> compared to those in the control group (P <. 01).

40|$|A b s t r a c t Background: Cardiac {{syndrome}} X (CSX) is characterised by angina-like chest pain, {{a positive}} stress test, and normal coronary arteries. Increased red cell distribution width (RDW) level may {{be indicative of}} an underlying inflammatory state. Aim: To investigate RDW level in patients with CSX and compare patients having coronary artery disease (CAD) and nor-mal subjects. Methods: 245 subjects (79 patients with CSX, 81 patients with CAD, and 85 controls) {{were enrolled in the}} study. The CSX group consisted of patients with anginal chest pain, ischaemia on noninvasive stress test and a normal coronary angiogram. CAD was defined as ≥ 50 % stenosis in at least one coronary artery. The control group was selected from the patients with anginal symptoms but a normal stress test and a normal coronary angiogram. RDW measurements among the three groups were compared. Results: Baseline clinical and biochemical characteristics were not different among the three groups. There were no statisti-cally significant differences in RDW levels between the CSX and <b>CAD</b> <b>groups</b> (p = 0. 17). RDW measurements in both the CSX and <b>CAD</b> <b>groups</b> were found to be significantly higher than the control group (p < 0. 01). Conclusions: We discovered that patients with CSX and CAD have significantly higher RDW measurements compared to controls. The relationship between CSX and higher RDW level suggests that endothelial dysfunction may also contribute to the etiopathogenesis of the CSX phenomenon as it does with CAD.

40|$|Several {{main risk}} factors of {{coronary}} artery disease (CAD) were studied in consecutive 200 subjects undergoing coronary angiography. Especially, {{in order to examine}} the effect of disturbance of glucose and lipid metabolism on the progression of CAD, glucose tolerance test was carried out and the levels of serum lipids and apoproteins were measured in 90 cases selected at random from 200 subjects. Results were compared between the patients with CAD (n= 51) and normal controls (n= 39). The following results were obtained. 1) The incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM) was 24 % in <b>CAD</b> <b>group</b> and was 3. 1 times higher than that of control group. The prevalence of abnormal glucose tolerance (AGT) which include both DM and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) was 48 % in <b>CAD</b> <b>group</b> and was 2. 7 times higher than that of control group. These high incidence showed that some factors derived from disturbed glucose metabolism must play an important role for the progression of CAD. 2) Low levels of HDL-cholesterol (43. 2 ± 1. 7 mg/dl) and high values of atherogenic index (4. 9 ± 0. 3) in <b>CAD</b> <b>group</b> were most important risk factors in the study of serum lipid. Furthermore, these results were independently different in <b>CAD</b> <b>group</b> with or without AGT compared to control group statistically (p< 0. 025 - 0. 02). 3) In the study of apoprotein (A-I, A-II, B, C-II, E), low apo A-I value was noted significantly in <b>CAD</b> <b>group</b> (115. 7 ± 3. 0 mg/dl) compared to control group (132. 2 ± 4. 0 mg/dl) (p< 0. 005). It has been reported that slightly higher apo A-I levels were observed in diabetics. Therefore, low apo A-I value was indicated to be an important discriminator for the coronary atherosclerosis in <b>CAD</b> <b>group</b> with AGT. Apo C-II and apo E levels were significantly higher (p< 0. 0025 - 0. 001) in <b>CAD</b> <b>group</b> with AGT, which might indicate the abnormal metabolism of triglyceride rich lipoprotein induced by abnormal glucose tolerance. 4) Although blood glucose levels were not different significantly between CAD and control groups, hypersecretion of insulin was detected in <b>CAD</b> <b>group</b> (p< 0. 05). In order to clarify the reason of hyperinsulin response during glucose loading, erythrocytes insulin receptors were measured. Insulin binding to erythrocytes was not different in both groups.

40|$|Objective]Patients with {{coronary}} artery disease (CAD) often have prior stroke or concomitant extra-cardiac vascular disease (EVD) such as cerebral, aortic, or peripheral vascular disease. However, clinical outcomes after coronary revascularization in patients with polyvascular disease have not been fully elucidated. [Methods]Among 15, 263 patients undergoing first coronary revascularization enrolled in the CREDO-Kyoto registry Cohort- 2 from January 2005 to December 2007, there were 1443 patients with prior stroke (stroke + <b>CAD</b> <b>group),</b> 974 patients with EVD (EVD + <b>CAD</b> <b>group),</b> 253 patients with both prior stroke and EVD (stroke/EVD/CAD group) and 12, 593 patients with neither prior stroke nor EVD (CAD alone group [reference]). [Results]The cumulative incidence of {{major adverse cardiovascular events}} (MACE: composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stroke) through 3 years was significantly higher in patients with polyvascular disease compared with reference patients (19. 9 % in the stroke + <b>CAD</b> <b>group,</b> 18. 5 % in the EVD + <b>CAD</b> <b>group,</b> 20. 1 % in the stroke/EVD/CAD group, and 11. 2 % in the CAD alone group, P < 0. 0001). After adjusting confounders, the presence of EVD and/or stroke was independently associated with higher risk for MACE compared with the reference group (adjusted HR [95 %CI]: 1. 34 [1. 17 – 1. 54], P < 0. 0001 in the stroke + <b>CAD</b> <b>group,</b> 1. 56 [1. 32 – 1. 84], P < 0. 0001 in the EVD + <b>CAD</b> <b>group,</b> and 1. 66 [1. 24 – 2. 23], P = 0. 0007 in the stroke/EVD/CAD group).

[Conclusions]Clinical outcome after coronary revascularization was worse in patients with prior stroke and/or EVD, which was mainly driven by the increased risk for non-coronary cardiovascular events...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE — In {{patients}} with uncomplicated diabetes, there is low probability of finding significant {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD) by noninvasive tests. Therefore, screening for its presence is not justified, {{and it is important}} to find reliable predictors of silent CAD to identify {{patients with}} uncomplicated diabetes for further screening. The relationship between lipopro-tein(a) [Lp(a) ], apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a) ] polymorphism, and silent CAD has never been stud-ied. We investigated the association of Lp(a) and apo(a) polymorphism with angiographically documented asymptomatic CAD in type 2 diabetic patients without evident complications. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — A total of 1, 323 diabetic patients without any clinical and electrocardiographic evidence of CAD were evaluated. Of 121 patients with highly positive results of exercise electrocardiography (ECG) (n 30) or positive results on exercise thallium scintigraphy (n 91), 103 subjects showed angiographically documented CAD (<b>CAD</b> <b>group).</b> Of 1, 106 patients with negative results on exercise ECG, 103 subjects without CAD (NO <b>CAD</b> <b>group)</b> were selected and matched by age, gender, and duration of diabetes to patients in the <b>CAD</b> <b>group.</b> In patients in the NO <b>CAD</b> <b>group,</b> results of exercise ECG, 48 -h ambulatory ECG, and stress echocardiography were negative for CAD. RESULTS — The <b>CAD</b> <b>group</b> had higher Lp(a) levels (21. 7 17. 7 vs. 15. 2 19. 0 mg/dl; P 0. 0093) than the NO <b>CAD</b> <b>group,</b> and a percentage of subjects had at least one small apo(a) isoform (68. 9 vs. 29. 1 %; P 0. 0000) higher than the NO <b>CAD</b> <b>group.</b> Logistic regression analysis showed that apo(a) phenotypes (odds ratio [OR] 8. 13, 95 % CI 3. 65 – 21. 23), microalbu-minuria (5. 38, 2. 44 – 11. 88), smoking (2. 72, 1. 31 – 5. 64), and Lp(a) levels (2. 41, 1. 15 – 5. 03) were predictors of asymptomatic CAD. CONCLUSIONS — Our investigation reports the first evidence of an independent associa-tion of Lp(a) and apo(a) polymorphism with asymptomatic CAD.

A 2 3 factorial arrangement with three dietary CAD levels (100, 200, and 500 mEq/kg) and two levels of xylanase supplementation (0 and 0. 1 !ylanase derived from Trichoderma longibrachiatum) was used. Thirty-six individually housed, castrated pigs (5 weeks old) with an initial body weight of 9. 34 ± 0. 28 kg (mean ± SEM) {{were randomly assigned to}} the six treatments. Diets were provided to pigs as cold pellets. Pigs had ad libitum access to feed and water. Venous plasma Cl concentration was higher (p < 0. 0001) in dietary CAD of 100 mEq/kg group compared with the other two <b>CAD</b> <b>groups.</b> Dietary <b>CAD</b> did not affect Na and K concentrations in the venous plasma. Growth rates were higher (p < 0. 05) in pigs receiving dietary CAD of 200 mEq/kg (657 g/pig. day) and dietary CAD of 500 mEq/kg (603 g/pig. day) than in pigs receiving dietary CAD of 100 mEq/kg (484 g/pig. day).

We examined whether baPWV was associated with coronary atherosclerosis and presence and extent of coronary artery disease (CAD) in older patients with chest pain. Methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled 370 consecutive patients > 65  years old who underwent baPWV measurement and elective coronary angiogram for suspected CAD at a single cardiovascular center, between June 2013 and July 2014. Results: In addition to diabetes mellitus and body mass index, baPWV {{was one of the}} statistically meaningful predictors of significant CAD (diameter of stenosis > 50 %) in a multivariate analysis. When the extent of CAD was classified as nonsignificant or significant CAD (ie, one-, two-, and three-vessel disease), {{there was a significant difference}} in baPWV between the significant and nonsignificant <b>CAD</b> <b>groups,</b> but not between the three significant <b>CAD</b> <b>groups.</b> Multivariate linear regression analyses showed that the number of diseased vessels and baPWV were both significantly associated with the SYNTAX (SYNergy between percutaneous coronary intervention with TAXus and cardiac surgery) score. The cutoff value of baPWV at 1, 874  cm/s had a sensitivity of 60. 1 %, specificity of 70. 8 %, and area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0. 639 in predicting CAD. Conclusion: Arterial stiffness determined by baPWV was associated independently with CAD severity, as assessed by angiography and the SYNTAX score in older patients with chest pain. As a result, increased arterial stiffness assessed by baPWV is associated with the severity and presence of CAD in older patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four different CAD-CAM materials were used: VITA MARKII, VITA Enamic (VITA Zahnfabrik), Empress CAD, and e. max CAD (Ivoclar Vivadent). Rectangular bars for each material (except e. max CAD) were made by three procedures: saw cut, normal mill and fast mill. Each subgroup had a sample size of 5. Saw cut bars were cut by a BUHLER diamond blade saw. Milled bars were made using SIRONA CEREC MCXL milling unit. The 3 -point flexural strength test was performed using a universal testing machine. Surface roughness was measured using a profilomer. Student t-test and Tukey-Kramer statistical analysis were performed to check significant differences. RESULTS: e. max <b>CAD</b> saw cut <b>group</b> was significantly stronger than the milled group.

Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) were measured before and after treadmill testing. Values of baPWV were significantly reduced at 10 min after exercise in both groups, more in the <b>CAD</b> <b>group</b> than in the control group (baseline baPWV and post-exercise change [cm/sec]: 1, 527 ± 245 and - 132 ± 155 in the <b>CAD</b> <b>group,</b> 1, 439 ± 202 and - 77 ± 93 in the control group, respectively, P for change in each group < 0. 001, P for difference in changes between the two groups < 0. 001).

This study investigated pericardial fluid and serum levels of VEGF and endostatin in patients with or without ischemic heart disease. Methods: A total of 39 patients (24 patients in the <b>CAD</b> <b>group</b> with significant coronary artery disease; 15 patients in the non-CAD group without coronary artery disease) undergoing open heart surgery were enrolled. In the <b>CAD</b> <b>group,</b> patients were classified according to good coronary collateralization (Group A; n = 11) or poor coronary collateralization (Group B; n = 13). Pericardial fluid and serum samples were obtained {{at the time of}} surgery. VEGF and endostatin were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The levels of endostatin in both serum and pericardial fluid were significantly lower in the <b>CAD</b> <b>group</b> than in the non-CAD group (130. 5 ± 37. 3 ng/mL vs. 172. 4 ± 37. 8 ng/mL and 119. 0 ± 25. 0 ng/mL vs. 143. 0 ± 23. 5 ng/mL). The concentration of serum VEGF in the <b>CAD</b> <b>group</b> (92. 6 ± 18. 2 pg/mL) was significantly higher than that in the non-CAD group (75. 2 ± 22. 3 pg/mL). The concentration of serum VEGF in Group A (100. 1 ± 20. 7 pg/mL) was significantly higher than that in Group B (84. 3 ± 12. 4 pg/mL). The levels of pericardial fluid VEGF, serum and pericardial fluid endostatin were not significantly different between Groups A and B. Conclusion: Patients with coronary artery disease have lower serum and pericardial fluid levels of endostatin and higher serum levels of VEGF. Serum level VEGF, but not endostatin, is associated with good or poor collateralization in patients with coronary artery disease...|$|E
40|$|An {{absence of}} {{cholesterol}} ester transfer protein (CETP, protein; CETP, gene) {{results in an}} increase of the apolipoprotein AI levels {{and a decrease in}} the low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels. Thus, the CETP polymorphism is important in the assessment of risk of atherosclerosis. This study was conducted to elucidate the genotype distributions of the CETP polymorphism and association with plasma lipid levels in Koreans. The genotypes of the TaqI A and B polymorphic loci were associated with plasma triglyceride levels in the control and coronary artery disease (<b>CAD)</b> <b>groups.</b> There was linkage disequilibrium between TaqI A and B loci in the control group (χ 2 = 5. 58, p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Association studies of the CETP polymorphism have been carried out mainly with Caucasian populations; however, the results have not been consistent among different populations. A possible explanation for this diversity among populations may be differences in genetic backgrounds, which may be more important than environmental factors. We discuss the reasons for the incompatibility of the CETP polymorphism among populations...|$|R

Background. Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection {{is the most common}} infection in the world and coronary artery disease (CAD) is probably associated with it. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the association between HP infection and CAD in suspected patients referred for coronary angiography. The coronary angiographywas performed using Judkinsmethod and patients were assigned to participate in CAD positive (> 50 % luminal diameter stenosis) and negative groups. The serum HP IgG antibody was checked. Results. Positive and negative <b>CAD</b> <b>groups</b> consisted of 62 and 58 patients, respectively. HPwasmore prevalent among CAD+ patients, and with increasing the number of coronary arteries with stenosis, the HP seropositivity increased so that 76. 3 % of patients withmultiple vessel diseases (MVD) and 70 %of patients with single vessel diseases (SVD) wereHP seropositive versus 50 % in control group...|$|R
40|$|In {{cooperative}} {{applications such}} as <b>group</b> <b>CAD</b> and <b>group</b> software development systems, multiple processes {{communicate with each other}} by sharing complex data consisting of nested structures and pointers. Although the sharing of complex data structures in the distributed environment is achieved through the technology of distributed shared memory, a single cache coherence protocol cannot efficiently serve various access patterns generated by cooperative applications. By having a framework for allowing cooperative applications to customize coherence protocols according to their behaviors, hence, significant improvement of run-time efficiency is expected. This paper describes a framework of protocol customization for the sharing of volatile and persistent data in cooperative applications. The major obstacle in user-level customization of protocols is that there are too many states and state transitions in an unabstracted protocol to enable average users to describe them. The protocol custom [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Objective. We {{evaluated}} inflammatory cytokines and chemokine in {{peripheral blood}} mononuclear cells (PBMCs) {{in patients with}} either acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or stable coronary artery disease (CAD). Methods. We enrolled 20 ACS patients and 50 stable CAD patients without previous history of ACS who underwent cardiac catheterization. Patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of ≤ 30 [*]mL/min/ 1. 73 [*]m 2 and C-reactive protein of ≥ 1. 0 [*]mg/dL were excluded. Blood samples were collected from the patients just before catheterization, and PBMCs were isolated from the whole blood. The levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokine were measured by using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunoassays. Results. The expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin- (IL-) 6, IL- 10, IL- 23 A, IL- 27, and IL- 37 was significantly higher in the ACS group than in the <b>CAD</b> <b>group</b> (P< 0. 05). In contrast, the expression of IL- 33 was significantly lower in the ACS group than in the <b>CAD</b> <b>group</b> (P< 0. 05). The ACS patients had higher plasma levels of TNF-α, IL- 6, and IL- 10 in the ACS group than in the <b>CAD</b> <b>group.</b> Conclusion. Circulating levels of pro-/anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL- 23 A, IL- 27, IL- 33, and IL- 37, may be associated with the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in ACS patients...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{investigating}} daily fluctuation of PAI- 1 levels in relation to insulin resistance (IR) and daily profile of plasma insulin and glucose levels in 26 type 2 diabetic (T 2 D) patients with coronary artery disease (<b>CAD)</b> (<b>group</b> A), 10 T 2 D patients without <b>CAD</b> (<b>group</b> B), 12 nondiabetics with <b>CAD</b> (<b>group</b> C), and 12 healthy controls (group D). The percentage of PAI- 1 decrease was lower in group A versus group B (4. 4 ± 2. 7 versus 35. 0 ± 5. 4 %; P< 0. 05) and in C versus D (14. 0 ± 5. 8 versus 44. 7 ± 3. 1 %; P< 0. 001). HOMA-IR was higher in group A versus group B (P< 0. 05) and in C versus D (P< 0. 01). Simultaneously, AUCs of PAI- 1 and insulin were higher in group A versus group B (P< 0. 05) and in C versus D (P< 0. 01), while AUC of glucose did not differ between groups. In multiple regression analysis waist-to-hip ratio and AUC of insulin were independent determinants of decrease in PAI- 1. The altered diurnal fluctuation of PAI- 1, especially in T 2 D with CAD, might be strongly influenced by a prolonged exposure to hyperinsulinemia in the settings of increased IR and abdominal obesity, facilitating altogether an accelerated atherosclerosis...|$|E

40|$|Obesity is {{a growing}} issue in Ireland. The link between obesity, CKD and CAD has not {{previously}} been described in the Irish population. The prevalence of obesity and CKD was compared across 3 groups: population based estimates with self-reported CAD, population based estimates without self-reported CAD (SLAN- 07) and a random selection of cardiology outpatients with CAD. The SLAN- 07 is a representative survey of 1207 randomly selected participants ≥ 45 years. Validated methods measured parameters including waist circumference, blood pressure and markers of renal function specifically glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albumin: creatinine ratio. The Cardiology clinic surveyed a random selection of 126 participants ≥ 45 years with CAD. Similar parameters were measured using the validated methods utilised in SLAN- 07 study. Prevalence of obesity and renal disease was significantly higher in both <b>CAD</b> <b>groups.</b> At population level, risk factors were modelled using logistic regression to compare odds of participants with self-reported CAD with those without. Age, hypertension, obesity, elevated waist circumference, renal disease and diabetes are significantly associated with existing CAD. Obesity and CKD are more frequent in patients with CAD. Routine evaluation is essential to facilitate more intensive management of these risk factors...|$|R
40|$|Our {{aim was to}} {{determine}} whether lipoprotein lipase gene PvuII polymorphism can be considered as an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD) by conducting a meta-analysis of all available published trials, including our own study. In 7 seperate studies, 3289 subjects were screened for this substitution; meta-analysis included only some of these individuals. Among the 7 studies, 6 were performed on white subjects, whereas 1 was on patients with Saudi Arabic descent. Subgroup analysis indicated that individuals with PvuII substitution does not have an increased risk for CAD. The LPL-PvuII genotype and allele frequency distributions did not differ significantly between CAD patients and healthy controls. There was no difference in the distribution of LPL-PvuII genotypes between the healthy subjects and the patients with CAD. However, no significant differences in lipid variables (triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol) were determined for the PvuII polymorphisms in the patients with CAD. No significant differences were found in serum triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol levels for LPL-PvuII genotypes when the control and <b>CAD</b> <b>groups</b> were pooled. In conclusion, LPL-Pvu II polymorphism cannot be used as independent genetic risk factor for CAD...|$|R
