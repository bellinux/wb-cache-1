40|$|We {{explore the}} {{relationships}} between gender, career ambition, {{and the emergence of}} executive leadership. In Bureaucratic Ambition, Teodoro (2011) shows that public administration <b>career</b> <b>systems</b> shape bureaucrats’ ambitions, political behavior, and management strategies. But <b>career</b> <b>systems</b> are not neutral conduits of talent: administrators are more likely to pursue advancement when <b>career</b> <b>systems</b> favor them. This research proposes that women and men respond to gendered public <b>career</b> <b>systems.</b> Using national and state-level data on public school managers, we find marked gender disparities in the career paths that lead educators from the classroom to the superintendent post. Specifically, we find that female and elementary school teachers take longer to advance than male and secondary school teachers. We also find gender disparities in certification and experiences among school principals. Accordingly, female and elementary principals report lower levels of ambition. Such gendered <b>career</b> <b>systems</b> may lead to biases in policy agendas and management styles...|$|R

The authors first model {{the breakdown of the}} traditional ascriptive, status-based system, and then identify a more dynamic, achieve- ment-based system as its replacement. By relating the structure of careers to organizational growth and social change, the authors ex- plore how the modern achievement career came about.

5000|$|A central {{feature of}} all {{published}} editions of Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay is the <b>career</b> <b>system.</b> Characters advance by entering {{a series of}} careers that provide access {{to a series of}} new or improved skills and bonuses to attributes (called [...] "advances"). The selection of careers available to characters reflects the late medieval/early Renaissance setting of the Old World. Basic careers might be filled by any individual with a modest amount of training or instruction. Advanced careers require greater preparation and training, and, particularly in later editions, tend to be more appropriate to the lifestyle of an active adventurer. The <b>career</b> <b>system</b> gives an idea of what a character might have been doing either before embarking on a career as an adventurer (working as a baker, night watchman, rat catcher, or farmer) or as an ongoing occupation during and between adventures (thief, ranger, wizard's apprentice, druid), as well as how the character has changed and developed through their career (becoming a mercenary, explorer, or ship's captain).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{developments}} in labour relations in public services in European States. It demonstrates that labour relations in public services {{have tended to}} give more importance to collective bargaining. This trend is generally observable, {{but not to the}} same degree in every country. The paper gives an overview of developments in European countries by dealing with the legal framework of labour relations in public services and by looking at the role of government employers and public service trade unions. Particular attention is further paid to the level of centralisation and decentralisation of collective bargaining, {{as well as to the}} different outcomes of collective bargaining in different European states. The nature of the civil service system has much explanatory value with regard to the outcome of collective bargaining. Reformed non <b>career</b> <b>systems</b> tend to adopt much easier collective bargaining resulting in binding collective agreements than classical <b>career</b> <b>systems</b> do. The role of the state remains in all European countries an important factor that prevents public service labour relations to become industrial relations equivalent to those found in the private sector economy. ...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the recent}} {{research}} efforts into the antecedents of organizational commitment most {{especially in the}} developed economies, little empirical work has been conducted examining the effect of some human resource management practices such as performance appraisal <b>system,</b> <b>career</b> planning <b>system</b> and employee participation on organizational commitment. In this article, we examined {{the effect of these}} human resource management practices in explaining employee job commitment in the Nigerian banking sector. Based on a survey of 14 banks in Nigeria, the study applies regression analysis, correlation analysis and G-test in testing the hypotheses. Results indicate that performance appraisal <b>system,</b> <b>career</b> planning <b>system</b> and employee participation significantly influence employee job commitment and that the level of organizational commitment of employees in the Nigerian banking sector is low. The study therefore, recommends that for employees to be genuinely committed to their jobs, organizations should make conscious efforts at strategically managing performance appraisal, career planning and employee participation with a view to ensuring effective implementation and achieving desired results...|$|R

Players could now earn Steam Achievements for completing scenarios, as well as compete and compare scores online via Steam Leaderboards. It also featured level crossing animations, among other improvements. RailWorks 2 featured the same routes and content as the original game, and only one new route: TestTraK, based on the Test and validation centre, a German testing facility owned by Siemens Mobility that is used for technical acceptance tests and approvals of locomotives and rolling stock. Contents in retail versions could vary in different countries to include local routes and locomotives. Owners of the original RailWorks received a free upgrade to the RailWorks 2 core technology via the Steam platform.|$|E
50|$|Visually {{the game}} takes a {{different}} approach compared to previous PlayStation titles. The game looks more realistic and has a darker color scheme, {{it takes a lot}} of this from the arcade game in the Ridge Racer series, Rave Racer. For the first time in the Ridge Racer series, Rage Racer introduces a brand new advanced singleplayer <b>career</b> <b>system</b> which uses credits. The player can get credits from winning races which can then be used to buy and upgrade cars. The racing is separated into five classes, named 'Class 1' through to 'Class 5'. The game's objective is to earn money (Credits, or 'eg'), which can be spent on new cars or on upgrading existing cars. The player must place in the top three in all of each Classes' events to progress to the next class. The player can make three attempts within each class to enter the top three spots of a race. If the player wins all three races in a class using the correct grade of car (e.g., a Grade 1 car in Class 1), the gold trophy for that class is earned. Otherwise, the player simply moves on to the next class. When the player has completed the five 'Normal GP' events, the 'Extra GP' is unlocked. This allows the player to race the same Classes on reversed courses. As well as unlocking the Extra GP, the player receives 999,999,999 e.g. in Normal GP - more than enough to purchase all of the cars and upgrade them to Grade 5.Upon finishing Class 5 in the Extra GP, Class 6 is unlocked, along with the three 'secret' cars. Although it's in the Extra GP, the races in Class 6 are driven on the forward tracks. Class 6 features only four opponents rather than the eleven faced in all other classes.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to assess the {{contribution}} of the <b>career</b> <b>system</b> of Slovak teachers from the perspective of school principals. The theoretical part deals with the definition of the <b>career</b> <b>system</b> based on a literature research. Firstly, preconditions of the <b>career</b> <b>system</b> are defined. Secondly, the <b>career</b> <b>system</b> is described in detail, followed by its evaluation and comparison with the upcoming Czech <b>career</b> <b>system.</b> The practical part describes the used qualitative methods and approaches and includes findings from the field research. A multiple conn-Dove study was used to solve the research problem, in which the case is represented by ten principals from various schools. Semi-structured interviews with school principals, observing their interactions and document analysis were used for data collection. The result of the research was to create ten idiographic reports reflecting school principals' practical experience with the <b>career</b> <b>system.</b> Findings show significant dissatisfaction among school principals with the conception and implementation of the <b>career</b> <b>system</b> due to the administrative complexity of the system, its formalism, the lack of resources in the system and the lack of provided methodological support to school principals.
