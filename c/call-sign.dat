25|$|The WPC allots {{individual}} call-signs. Indian amateur radio {{operators are}} allotted only the VU <b>call-sign</b> prefix. The V or Viceroy, series prefix was allotted to British colonies. at the 1912 London International Radiotelegraphic Convention.|$|E
25|$|GWN {{applied to}} {{broadcast}} an additional service on 31 October 1984, when the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal called for applications to broadcast to Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands via satellite {{as part of}} the Remote Commercial Television License (RCTS) scheme. GWN was granted the Remote Commercial Television License (RCTS) in June 1985 and the service went to air on 18 October 1986 using the <b>call-sign</b> WAW.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to individual and club <b>call-signs,</b> the WPC allots temporary <b>call-signs</b> for contests and special events. For example, in November 2007, the WPC temporarily allotted the prefixes AT and AU to selected ham operators {{to mark the}} anniversary of the birth of radio scientist Jagadish Chandra Bose. The Indian Union territory (UT) of Andaman and Nicobar Islands are assigned the prefix VU4 and the UT of Lakshadweep is assigned VU7.|$|R

5000|$|When the [...] "Act to Regulate Radio Communication" [...] {{was passed}} on August 13, 1912, amateurs and experimenters were not banned from broadcasting; rather, amateurs were {{assigned}} their own frequency spectrum, and licensing and <b>call-signs</b> were introduced. By regulating the public airwaves, President Taft thus created the legal space for illicit broadcasts to take place. An entire federal agency, the Federal Radio Commission, {{was formed in}} 1927 and succeeded in 1934 by the Federal Communications Commission. These agencies would enforce rules on <b>call-signs,</b> assigned frequencies, licensing and acceptable content for broadcast.|$|R
25|$|The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) {{has divided}} all {{countries}} into three regions; India {{is located in}} ITU Region 3. These regions are further divided into two competing zones, the ITU and the CQ. Mainland India and the Lakshadweep Islands come under ITU Zone41 and CQ Zone22, and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands under ITU Zone49 and CQ Zone26. The ITU has assigned to India <b>call-sign</b> blocks 8TA to 8YZ, VUA to VWZ, and ATA to AWZ.|$|E
25|$|Once the quirks and foibles of the B12 are {{understood}} {{it is possible}} to compete effectively with other contemporary two-seaters. However the expected performance gains were only partly realised and the B12 does not rank with the highest performance gliders, as was hoped. One quirk is the B12 'sigh' which can be heard in certain flight conditions, the origin of which remains a mystery. Competition flying is carried out with the <b>call-sign</b> CB and a handicap index of 106 is applied. The aircraft carries registration 'D-7612'.|$|E
500|$|At 04:58 Ambassador Martin {{boarded a}} USMC CH-46 Sea Knight, <b>call-sign</b> Lady Ace 09 of HMM-165 and was flown to the USS Blue Ridge. When Lady Ace 09 {{transmitted}} [...] "Tiger is out," [...] those helicopter crews still flying thought {{the mission was}} complete, and delayed evacuating the Marines from the Embassy rooftop. CH-46s evacuated the Battalion Landing Team by 07:00 and after an anxious wait a lone CH-46 Swift 2-2 of HMM-164 arrived to evacuate Major Kean and the 10 remaining men of the Marine Security Guards, this last helicopter took off at 07:53 on 30 April and landed on USS Okinawa at 08:30.|$|E

40|$|Air-traffic {{has grown}} {{rapidly in the}} last twenty years and concern has been {{mounting}} about the safety implications of mis-recognition of <b>call-signs</b> by both pilots and air-traffic controllers. This paper presents the results of a preliminary study into perceptual (i. e. non-cognitive) confusions in two closed vocabularies of the type used as aircraft <b>call-signs.</b> Conventional methods of subjective and objective testing were found to be unsuitable for our aim of predicting potential confusions within a vocabulary. Hence a method for modelling confusion probability in a closed vocabulary at a certain signal-to-noise ratio has been developed. The method is based on the use of a phoneme confusion matrix and a technique for comparing phoneme strings. The method is presented and results are given. These suggest that the behaviour of the model is plausible, and a comparison of its predictions with a set of real confusions showed a correct prediction of position of confusion in three-word phrases. The predictions of the model need to be verified by subjective testing before it can be deployed in a system that designs low-confusability <b>call-signs,</b> which is the ultimate goal of the research.

Examples of Indian amateur radio call-signs are [...] "VU2XY" [...] and [...] "VU2XYZ".|$|E
2500|$|As {{she closed}} the gap, the Australian cruiser {{requested}} that Kormoran identify herself. Communications were initially attempted with a signal lamp to repeatedly send [...] "NNJ" [...] ("You should make your signal letters"), but those aboard the raider {{did not understand the}} uncommonly used signal and did not respond. Sydney continued to signal for 30 minutes, after which those aboard the cruiser used flags to send the more common [...] "VH" [...] signal ("You should hoist your signal letters"), while the signal lamp was used to transmit the message in plain language. After another delay, Kormoran raised [...] "PKQI"—the <b>call-sign</b> for the Dutch merchant ship Straat Malakka—on the triatic stay and hoisted a Dutch merchant ensign. As Sydney was approaching from just starboard of Kormorans stern and [...] away, the <b>call-sign</b> was obscured by the raider's funnel: German accounts vary as to if this was to further the illusion of a civilian ship, a ruse to lure Sydney closer, or an error on the signaller's part. Sydney signalled [...] "Make your signal letters clear", which the signals officer aboard Kormoran did by lengthening the halyard and swinging it around to starboard. By 16:35, with Sydney [...] away, the malfunctioning engine aboard Kormoran was repaired, but Detmers chose to keep it in reserve.|$|E
2500|$|Buoyed by this success, the BBC {{started the}} [...] "V for Victory" [...] campaign, {{for which they}} put in charge the {{assistant}} news editor Douglas Ritchie posing as “Colonel Britton”. Ritchie suggested an audible V using its Morse code rhythm (three dots and a dash). As the rousing opening bars of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony had the same rhythm, the BBC used this as its <b>call-sign</b> in its foreign language programmes to occupied Europe {{for the rest of}} the war. The more musically educated also understood that it was the Fate motif [...] "knocking on the door" [...] of the Third Reich.|$|E
