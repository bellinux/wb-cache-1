25|$|The floor {{selector}} lever {{also has an}} S position. When S is selected, sport mode is activated in the DSG. Sport mode still functions as a fully automatic mode, identical in operation to D mode, but upshifts and downshifts are made much higher up the engine rev-range. This aids a more sporty driving manner, by utilising considerably more of the available engine power, and also maximising engine braking. However, this mode does have a detrimental effect on the vehicle fuel consumption, when compared to D mode. This mode may not be ideal to use when wanting to drive in a sedate manner; nor when road conditions are very slippery, due to ice, snow or torrential rain — because loss of tire traction may be experienced (wheel spin during acceleration, and may also result in road wheel locking during downshifts at high engine rpms under <b>closed</b> <b>throttle).</b> On 4motion or quattro-equipped vehicles this may be partially offset by the drivetrain maintaining full-time engagement of the rear differential in S mode, so power distribution under loss of front-wheel traction may be marginally improved.|$|E

50|$|Contrast a petrol engine, {{where the}} {{mechanics}} are different {{and a special}} valve is not necessary for engine braking to occur when the driver releases the accelerator.

50|$|If vacuum is {{required}} (vehicles {{that can be}} fitted with both petrol and diesel engines often have systems requiring it), a butterfly valve connected to the throttle can be fitted to the manifold. This reduces efficiency and is still not as effective as it is not connected to a venturi.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the automotive uses listed above (i.e. in two-stroke-engine vehicles and early four-stroke Saabs), freewheels were used in some luxury or up-market conventional cars (such as Rovers and Cords) from the 1930s into the 1960s. Some engines of the period also tended to pass oil past the piston rings under conditions with a <b>closed</b> <b>throttle</b> and high engine speed, when the slight vacuum in the combustion chamber combined with high oil pressure and {{a high degree of}} splash lubrication from the fast-turning crankshaft would lead to oil getting in the combustion chamber.|$|E
5000|$|A {{throttle}} position sensor (TPS) is a sensor used to monitor the {{throttle position}} of a vehicle.

50|$|A {{lean burn}} mode {{is a way}} to reduce {{throttling}} losses. An engine in a typical vehicle is sized for providing the power desired for acceleration, but must operate well below that point in normal steady-speed operation. Ordinarily, the power is cut by partially <b>closing</b> a <b>throttle.</b> However, the extra work done in pumping air through the throttle reduces efficiency. If the fuel/air ratio is reduced, then lower power can be achieved with the <b>throttle</b> <b>closer</b> to fully open, and the efficiency during normal driving (below the maximum torque capability of the engine) can be higher.|$|R
50|$|If {{the engine}} is {{operating}} under light or no load and low or <b>closed</b> <b>throttle,</b> there is high manifold vacuum. As the throttle is opened, the engine speed increases rapidly. The engine speed is limited only {{by the amount of}} fuel/air mixture that is available in the manifold. Under full throttle and light load, other effects (such as valve float, turbulence in the cylinders, or ignition timing) limit engine speed so that the manifold pressure can increase—but in practice, parasitic drag on the internal walls of the manifold, plus the restrictive nature of the venturi {{at the heart of the}} carburetor, means that a low pressure will always be set up as the engine's internal volume exceeds the amount of the air the manifold is capable of delivering.|$|E
5000|$|Diesel engine {{vehicles}} do {{not have}} a throttle. Diesel engines regulate power output purely by the volume and timing of fuel injected into the combustion chambers.

However Clessie L. Cummins, founder of Cummins Engine Company, realized that by opening the cylinder exhaust valves when the piston reached top dead centre, rather than {{at the end of the}} power stroke, the accumulated compressed air in the cylinder could be vented before it could act as a [...] "spring" [...] to drive the piston back down again. By doing this, the engine acts as an air compressor, with the energy coming from the transmission used to compress the air, hence slowing the vehicle. The amount of power extracted from the transmission can be up to 90% of the rated power of the engine for certain engines.|$|E

The magnitude of the oscillation was recorded either by a kymograph or an airspeed meter.

40|$|On a turbo engine, the Blow of Valve (BOV) is used {{to relieve}} the {{pressure}} from the turbo output when the throttle is closed. Without the BO y, when the throttle is closed the turbo is suddenly trying to pump air against a <b>closed</b> <b>throttle</b> plate.

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} to the cylinder walls of internal combustion engines is {{recognized as one of}} the most important factors that in influences both engine design and operation. Research eff�orts concerning heat transfer in internal combustion engines often target the investigation of thermal loading at critical combustion chamber components. Simulation of internal combustion engine heat transfer using low dimensional thermodynamic modelling often relies on quasi-steady heat transfer correlations. However unsteady thermal boundary layer modelling could make a useful contribution because of the inherent unsteadiness of the internal combustion engine environment. In this study, a computational and experimental study is presented. The experiments are performed on a spark-ignition, single-cylinder engine under motored and �red conditions. In the present study, decoupled simulations are performed, in which quasi-steady heat transfer models are used to obtain the gas properties in the core region. A scaled Eichelberg's model is used in the simulation of the motored test under wide open and fully <b>closed</b> <b>throttle</b> settings. In the �red case the scaled Woschni's model was used. The scaling factor is used to achieve a good agreement between measured and simulated pressure histories. An unsteady heat transfer model based on the unsteady thermal boundary layer is presented in this study. Turbulent kinetic energy in the core of the cylinder is modelled by considering the balance between production and dissipation terms as suggested by previous authors. An effective variable thermal conductivity is applied to the unsteady model with diff�erent turbulent Prandtl number models and turbulent viscosity models, and a �xed value is assumed for the thermal boundary layer thickness. The unsteady model is run using the gas properties identif�ed from the quasi-steady simulation. The results from the quasi-steady modelling showed that no agreement was achieved between the measured and the simulated heat flux using the scaled Eichelberg's model for the motored case and the scaled Woschni's model for the �red case. A signifi�cant improvement in the simulation of the heat flux measurements was achieved when the unsteady energy equation modelling of the thermal boundary layer was applied. The simulation results have only a small sensitivity to the boundary layer thickness. The simulated heat flux using the unsteady model with one particular turbulent Prandtl number model, agreed with measured heat flux in the wide open throttle and fully <b>closed</b> <b>throttle</b> cases, with an error in peak values of about 6 % and 35 % for those cases respectively. In the �red case, a good agreement was also observed from the unsteady model and the error in the peaks between the measured and the simulated heat flux was found to be about 9 %. The turbulent Prandtl number and turbulent viscosity models are derived from quasi-steady flow experiments and hence their general applicability to the unsteady internal combustion engine environment remains uncertain. The thermal boundary layer thicknesses are signifi�cant relative to the internal combustion engine clearance height and therefore, the assumption of an adiabatic core is questionable. Investigation of a variable thermal boundary layer thickness and more closely coupled simulation to account for heat loss from the entire volume of the gas should be targeted in the future. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{two-stroke}} engines {{replacement of}} carburetors with {{direct fuel injection}} systems greatly reduces engine emissions and fuel consumption by eliminating fuel short-circuiting. Air-blast direct fuel injection using a dedicated air pump has been successfully applied to both two- and four-stroke engines. In this study we re-examine {{the design of a}} low cost compression pressurized direct injection system. This system uses gases extracted from the combustion chamber during the compression stroke to supply pressure for the air blast injection, thus eliminating the air pump [1, 2]. Gases, predominantly scavenging air, are transferred to a mixing cavity from the combustion chamber via a small (5 mm diameter) solenoid poppet valve as the piston rises during the compression stroke. Proper functioning of the system requires careful optimization of the mixing cavity size and the blast valve timing to ensure adequate mixing cavity pressure and fuel atomization. To assist in the optimization of these design parameters a one-dimensional fluid dynamics model has been developed. Parameter sensitivity studies were carried out using the model to determine the optimum cavity size, blast valve timing, and fuel injection duration. These parameters were optimized over a wide range of engine speeds and throttle settings. Results show that a mixing cavity pressure of 500 kPa is attainable over the range of 1000 to 6000 rpm, from <b>closed</b> <b>throttle</b> to wide open throttle (WOT) without cavity pressurization encroaching into the ignition regime.
