40|$|This project {{focuses on}} the news {{selection}} at the Danish media station Danmarks Radio (DR). The project examines what it takes for DR to bring up a news story from municipalities in remote areas. Afterwards we studied the represented topics in the news stories that hit the public platform and whether the presentation is democratic {{in proportion to the}} fact that DR is assigned to a public service commitment. To answer this we coded seven months of DR’s late evening news broadcast from 1 st of october 2014 to 30 th of april 2015 - a total amount of 1. 453 news stories in 150 broadcasts. The coding has been done {{on the basis of a}} coding table. Based on the results we have made a quantitative analysis to examine the total amount of news stories, whether or not they are from at specific region or city, which topics are represented etc. We chose to focus on the 868 stories <b>concerning</b> <b>Denmark.</b> Our results showed that 41, 01 % of the news stories were general - for example a political story from Christiansborg. 58, 99 % of the stories originated from one of the five Danish regions. Several of the news stories were from the Capital Region. The Region of Zealand and Northern Jutland were clearly under-represented. Our results also show that politics, business life and economics are the dominating topics. ‘Health’ is also highly represented. Besides from that DR covers a lot of different topics. Because our main focus in the project is the remote areas in Denmark, we chose to take a closer look at the stories that originate from here. These 20 news stories from the remote municipalities have been the object for a qualitative framing analysis by using the four stages by the theorist Robert Entman. Max McCombs’ agenda-setting-theory is also used in relation to this. We were able to identify five different frames and under each of these we have chosen one typical example for a thorough analysis. There was a majority of news stories with a positive frame. As a supplement to the analysis there has been made three interviews with head people at DR News to obtain knowledge about the editorial practice in order to answer our problem statement. The answers from the interviews are used in both the framing analysis and the discussion to give the project even more substance. The results from our analysis are the foundation of the discussion, which is divided into two seperate paragraphs. The first focuses on how the news selection and prioritization at DR is expressed in our analysis results. Here we discuss the presentation of the remote municipalties in the selected news stories, and also how the different types of framing in the stories can have a catching effect on society. Also DR’s role as a public service media who has to deliver news stories for the entire population combined with the fact that they have to and want to bring significant news stories is discussed. The second part discusses whether there are some democratic problems related to the selection of stories given the fact that DR has a large role in the public debate. In this part of the discussion Jürgen Habermas and the term ‘public sphere’ is implicated. The analysis results and the discussion are summarized in a conclusion. We can conclude that DR through their framing of news stories from remote communities is trying to break with the prejudices concerning remote communities in the society debate. Because of the structure of the late news broadcast the news from these communities are in tough competition with other general news stories. DR is trying to be constructive in their news broadcasting, which can lead to elimination of conflict based news. Seen from a democratic point of view it can be problematic that DR only cover few stories from the remote municipalities. However it is important to remember that when it comes to the modern media image, DR is not the only source of information...|$|E

40|$|In {{terms of}} dress and fashion Denmark {{is an example}} of a West European {{peripheral}} country within the international fashion system. Since the Middle Ages, new fashions have found their way to Denmark through the internationally oriented royal family, the purchases of well-traveled citizens, various international and national fashion reports, and the international purchases by local retailers. With varying speed new cuts, colors and styles have impressed themselves upon both the everyday and festive fashions of the Danish wardrobe. The same foreign influence applies to local fashion production. Design, craftsmanship and technology has through time been shaped under influences from abroad. But these international influences have not undermined the recurring idea of a particular Danish dress and fashion culture. In the middle of the 19 th century the prevailing view was that the peasants’ festive dress represented specific national dress. By the beginning of the 21 st century discussions in the Danish fashion industry and industry policy <b>concern</b> <b>Denmark’s</b> status as a fashion nation and Copenhagen as a possible new global fashion center.

30|$|As can be {{seen from}} Figure 1, the notions of quality differ across {{countries}} according to the views they hold of the child. To understand the quality issue, it is important to inquire into the underlying view of the child held by different societies and stakeholders within them. As one example, some countries emphasise childhood as important “here and now”. Some others emphasise the child as “a future citizen”. In the first case, the image of children is as rich, strong and powerful. This view calls attention to their developmental <b>concerns.</b> Countries (<b>Denmark,</b> Finland, Norway and Sweden) with the tradition of integrated care and education emphasise child’s development and well being. In this view, quality is equal to holistic development of the child. An implication of this approach for ECEC pedagogy would be to co-construct programme aims and objectives for the child at the local level by engaging a range of stakeholders in the process.|$|R

5000|$|Preventing spatial {{segregation}} and ethnic enclaves {{has been a}} growing <b>concern</b> in <b>Denmark</b> since the 1980s. Denmark's first dispersal act was passed in 1986 and enforced the geographic dispersal of arriving refugee populations across the 13 Danish counties. The Integration Act of 1998 reassigned primary responsibility to find local housing for refugees and organize programs to introduce refugees to Danish society to municipalities. The 1998 legislation also tied immigrant introductory programs and welfare benefits to residing in their assigned municipality in order to discourage relocation.Legislation to further promote integration of immigrant populations, titled [...] "A Change for Everyone" [...] was passed in May 2005. Part of {{the aim of this}} legislation was to combat ethnic ghettoization of neighborhoods. This act gave municipalities the right to deny housing to applicants on housing waiting lists that had received public benefits for 6 months or more in order to encourage unemployed immigrant populations to accept housing offers outside of areas with high concentrations of immigrants in an effort to diversify the composition of tenants in urban areas. This legislation aimed to balance housing waiting lists in cities such as Copenhagen with existing vacancies in geographic regions such as Jutland.|$|R
50|$|In {{its first}} operation, which {{was carried out}} with the {{assistance}} of the Husum fixed intercept stations, the platoon intercepted only coastal defense messages in Plaintext from <b>Denmark</b> <b>concerning</b> ship movements. No army radio traffic was heard. Even these messages ceased on 9th April 1940. Because of the great distance only a few Norwegian coastal stations were heard. Up to 8th April, this traffic was normal, but on the night of 8-9th April, it increased to a point of wild confusion. Normal army radio traffic was observed in Sweden. After the platoon's first move, to Als on the Kattegat, Norwegian Army messages were also intercepted, as well as traffic between Swedish and Norwegian radio stations. It was not until 24th April, i.e. eleven days after the operations had commenced, that the intercept platoon was moved up to Oslo and thus employed in the vicinity of the German operations staff.|$|R

Such <b>concern</b> has led <b>Denmark</b> since 2000 to impose ever tighter restrictions on spousal immigration (Jørgensen, 2012) and likewise more recently Germany, the Netherlands and the UK. Whilst ethnic intermarriage {{has been seen as}} a significant indicator of integration (Beck-Gernsheim, 2007, p. 272; Schinkel, 2011, p. 101; Song, 2009), the arrival of a first generation in every generation is seen as thwarting the process through which migrants and their descendants would otherwise have been incorporated (Charsley, Bolognani, & Spencer, 2014; Crul & Vermeulen, 2003). These discourses also tend to be highly gendered, with a focus on migrant women (from Muslim countries in particular) who are often portrayed as ‘bearers of a backwards and illiberal culture’ and lacking in education and skills, with consequences both for their own integration and that of their future children (Kofman, Saharso, & Vacchelli, 2015, p. 85).|$|R

40|$|Even though radio {{broadcasts}} have a historical significance, the radio media is slowly being overlooked by digital media. It is {{with this in}} mind that this project work focuses on the Danish radio channel Radio 24 syv, more concretely on two very different radio programs and their use of Facebook. Through the use of theories on social media, including the different ways of using social media, the different communicative functions, and the different implications that are to be found when practicing social media, the results were formulated: apart from any given communication product’s objectives and its’ commitment to social media, it is clear that there are certain elements, which have to be considered more than others.

Trefoil factor 3 (TFF 3) is an important protective peptid in intestinal mucosa. In this study TFF 3 was examined in human milk, using a specific ELISA (Dr. EM Vestergaard, Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Aarhus University Hospitals in Skejby/ Aarhus, <b>Denmark)</b> <b>concerning</b> dependence of TFF 3 -concentrations on gestational age at delivery and post partal time respectively. Initially TFF 3 -concentrations in stools of preterm and term born infants were measured, regarding intestinal developmentally regulated expression. The samples of stool and human milk were collected at the Department of Neonatology at the Charité Berlin, Campus Mitte, within five weeks after delivery, at predifined days. As TFF 3 is upregulated in inflammations, we analysed the influence of amniotic infection syndromes and inflammatory processes on TFF 3 -concentrations in human milk. We were the first to detect TFF 3 in human milk. TFF 3 -concentrations in human milk decreased significantly around two weeks after delivery. The statistical analysis showed no significant dependence of TFF 3 -concentrations on gestational age at delivery. Peripartal inflammations or amniotic infections did not change TFF 3 -concentrations in human milk significantly. Stool is not an appropriate matrix for measuring TFF 3.

40|$|Abstract “Ettelaat og oprøret I Qom – Iran 1978 ” {{is based}} on an {{interview}} with Hossein Hosseini, Chairman of Den Iranske Forening i Danmark (the Iranian association in <b>Denmark),</b> <b>concerning</b> the events preceding the Iranian revolution in 1978. Hossein Hosseini encouraged the author of this report to trace the spark that ignited the powder keg. In this specific context, the spark was an article, and the powder keg was the Iranian revolution. According to Hossein, an article published by 'Ettelaat', the government supported newspaper, caused the Iranian revolution to erupt. This report therefore focuses on an investigation and analysis of the content of this article, which has been translated from the original Persian version into Danish by two different translators [for this purpose]. Following a comparative analysis of the two translations, this report reaches several conclusions, for example that the content of the article [refers to/reflects] two prevalent themes in Iran's recent history. One is Iran's relationship with the great powers, and another is the fight for a government constitution. Based on a historical review of Iran's recent history, the analysis concludes that the article's author intends to quell the trends shown by the Iranian population that favour the opposition. He therefore questions the notion of the opposition's holy leader, imam Khomeini's religious and national legitimacy by claiming that Khomeini is not only in collusion with the great powers, but is also a heathen. This report concludes that the author of the article's plan fails. Following a long history with dictatorship and repression of freedom of speech, the Iranian people trust neither the regime nor the press that represents it, and therefore perceive the content of the article as pure fabrication. The report also concludes that the article's reference to the Iranian's collective history excludes important details, such as the Shah's cooperation with the USA, and instead turns criticism of the regime against the opposition. It is presumably this tactic that triggered the violent reaction among the article's readers...|$|R

5000|$|Among {{these studies}} {{there is a}} {{negative}} correlation between happiness and income inequality: [...] "It seems rather evident that people live happier in the most egalitarian societies and that the differences in happiness will be smaller. Yet in this issue {{we have seen that}} this does not apply to all inequalities and particularly not to income inequality. Income inequality is essentially unrelated to the average happiness of citizens and only modestly related to the dispersion of happiness among them." [...] In the World Happiness report for Denmark, the authors fashion a new approach where they measure happiness in terms of [...] "inequality of well-being". The novelty of the approach needs to garner more consensus to add to the research between happiness and inequality. Nonetheless, using this approach, the report found that while income is an important factor, equality of well-being and life satisfaction are better indicators of happiness. Denmark ranks high on life satisfaction and in how they perceive themselves and others to be happy; meaning the inequality of well-being in Denmark is low. Evidence suggest that a relationship may yet exist between income and happiness, but using metrics such as the Gallup World poll, happiness gaps among countries, and in Denmark in particular, may have deeper unknown variables at work that transcend income inequality. General disparities of inequality in Danish society are low and {{are a part of the}} broader moral philosophy of egalitarianism that is characteristic of Scandinavia and holds that policy makers be morally impelled to suppress inequality as much as possible. Denmark, in terms of this institutional egalitarianism, has been labeled as having a social-democratic regime of welfare. The substantiality of the welfare state's reach in <b>Denmark</b> <b>concerning</b> income equality has led it to protect its citizens against the worst impact of the market and capitalism's more destabilizing effects. Even amid bad economic conditions in Denmark's past, poverty has lessened and standards of living and equality have increased. The preponderance of the evidence between income inequality and happiness suggests a possible link, but more research is needed for far-ranging conclusions.|$|R
