This paper presents an effective method of distinguishing unnatural language from natural language, and evaluates the impact of unnatural language detection on NLP tasks such as document clustering. We view this problem as an information extraction task and build a multiclass classification model identifying unnatural language components into four categories. First, we create a new annotated corpus by <b>collecting</b> <b>slides</b> and papers in various formats, PPT, PDF, and HTML, where unnatural language components are annotated into four categories. We then explore features available from plain text to build a statistical model that can handle any format {{as long as it is}} converted into plain text. Our experiments show that removing unnatural language components gives an absolute improvement in document clustering up to 15 %. Our corpus and tool are publicly available...|$|R

A cellular DNA recovery test is performed in parallel to HPV DNA testing to ensure that sufficient cells are present and purification of sample DNA has been successfully performed. Previous studies have not comprehensively assessed DNA recovery rates in slides older than 13 years. We undertook a study to determine the factors impacting DNA recovery in 436 UK slides dating from 11 to 33 years prior to testing. Overall, a low cellular DNA recovery success rate of 29 % was obtained but a strong trend was observed with increasing recovery rates the older the slides (P < 0. 001). Recovery rates increased from 22 % in the most recent <b>slides</b> <b>collected</b> from 1988 to 1992, to 61 % in the oldest <b>slides,</b> <b>collected</b> in 1970 - 72.

Fourier spectra and morphological pattern spectra are analysed to extract parameters that relate to particle size and shape. The Fourier transform however lacks the ability to incorporate information about the particle shape, while Mathematical morphology (MM) allows for the determination of a structural element that {{is related to the}} debris morphology. Different spectral parameters are calculated and correlated to the physical occurrence of large agglomerated debris particles at high sliding temperatures. From the correlation coefficients between different spectrum parameters and their respective experimental parameters it is concluded that the mean and standard deviation of FFT spectra are proportional to temperature, while entropy is inversely proportional to normal load. Parameters calculated from a pattern spectrum generally provide better correlation with experimental sliding conditions compared to the FFT parameters, under conditions that the shape and threshold value of the filter element is appropriately chosen...|$|R

50|$|The Imhoff tank, {{named for}} German {{engineer}} Karl Imhoff (1876-1965), is a chamber {{suitable for the}} reception and processing of sewage. It {{may be used for}} the clarification of sewage by simple settling and sedimentation, along with anaerobic digestion of the extracted sludge. It consists of an upper chamber in which sedimentation takes place, from which <b>collected</b> solids <b>slide</b> down inclined bottom slopes to an entrance into a lower chamber in which the sludge is collected and digested. The two chambers are otherwise unconnected, with sewage flowing only through the upper sedimentation chamber and no flow of sewage in the lower digestion chamber. The lower chamber requires separate biogas vents and pipes for the removal of digested sludge, typically after 6-9 months of digestion. The Imhoff tank is in effect a two-story septic tank and retains the septic tank's simplicity while eliminating many of its drawbacks, which largely result from the mixing of fresh sewage and septic sludge in the same chamber.|$|R

In the case of water lubrication of black rubber at slow speeds and low pressures the lubricating ability of water is shown to be enhanced by addition of electrolytes to the water. It is thought that negative ions from the electrolytic solution <b>collect</b> on each <b>sliding</b> surface, repel each other and prevent the close approach of two sliding surfaces.

40|$|Objective: A {{double-blind}} {{study was conducted}} to compare the performance of the new BestPrep(R) (CellSolutions) liquid-based thin-layer Papanicolaou (Pap) test with ThinPrep(R) (Hologic). Study Design: Samples from the study patients (n = 105) were collected twice in the same encounter with the ThinPrep sample always taken first and the BestPrep sample <b>collected</b> second. <b>Slides</b> were prepared according to both manufacturers' protocols and evaluated using manual microscopic review and the BestCyte(R) cell sorter imaging system (CellSolutions). Diagnostic truth for each case was determined by independent manual review of both slides by multiple pathologists and histology when available. The presence of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance was the threshold for positive for sensitivity and specificity calculations. Results: BestPrep and ThinPrep, by manual review, had sensitivities for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) cases of 100 and 95. 6 %, respectively. Using the BestCyte cell sorter, both had 100 % sensitivity. For the same HSIL cases, the digene HC 2 high-risk human papillomavirus DNA test had sensitivities of 100 % (BestPrep) and 95. 6 % (ThinPrep). Specificities were 71. 4 % (BestPrep) and 54. 8 % (ThinPrep). Conclusions: BestPrep was equivalent to ThinPrep for manual review even though BestPrep was always the second sample collected.
