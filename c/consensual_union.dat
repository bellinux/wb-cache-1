40|$|Global {{population}} ageing {{has led to}} considerable disquiet {{about future}} support for frail older people; however, the determinants are poorly understood. It is especially important to investigate the determinants of support in old age in developing societies {{with little or no}} government institutional protection for older people, and where current cohorts of older people are survivors of undernourishment, multiple diseases in early life, and have accumulated few savings (Palloni, 2001). Moreover, the developing world has also experienced numerous changes that have profoundly transformed families (e. g. fertility declines and rises in divorce). Unlike the West, which until recently largely conformed to norms concerning marriage and childbearing within marriage, Latin America has been characterized by high levels of <b>consensual</b> <b>unions</b> and childbearing outside of marriage (Castro-Martin, 2001). Given the greater fluidity of <b>consensual</b> <b>unions,</b> rates of family disruption are relatively high, and there is greater heterogeneity in family patterns (Goldman, 1981). Moreover, although information on <b>consensual</b> <b>unions</b> was not widely collected until the censuses in the 1950 s, the little trend data there is shows a rise in the prevalence of these union types (Glaser, 1994).

Proponents such as 14 Ateneo de Manila University professors, argued thus: [...] "Studies show that the majority of women who go for an abortion are married or in a <b>consensual</b> <b>union</b> (91%), the mother of three or more children (57%), and poor (68%) (Juarez, Cabigon, and Singh 2005). For these women, terminating a pregnancy is an anguished choice they make in the face of severe constraints. When women who had attempted an abortion were asked their reasons for doing so, their top three responses were: they could not afford the economic cost of raising another child (72%); their pregnancy occurred too soon after the last one (57%); and they already have enough children (54%). One in ten women (13%) who had attempted an abortion revealed that this was because her pregnancy resulted from forced sex (ibid.).

40|$|Background : Research {{has shown}} that the {{prevalence}} of unmarried cohabitation has increased in most Latin American countries and that childbearing within <b>consensual</b> <b>union,</b> traditionally confined to low-income groups, is becoming socially acceptable among highly educated women. Objective : We focus on the increasing importance of childbearing within <b>consensual</b> <b>union</b> for overall fertility. We measure the relative contribution of births within marriage and births within <b>consensual</b> <b>union</b> to period fertility as a component of population change for 13 Latin American countries from 1980 to 2010. Methods : We use census data and the own-children method to estimate the contribution of marriage and <b>consensual</b> <b>union</b> to age-specific fertility rates, to cumulative fertility, and to the TFR. Results : In most Latin American countries the contribution of marriage to age-specific fertility rates has decreased over time, whereas the contribution of <b>consensual</b> <b>union</b> has increased steadily. In Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Costa Rica, and Mexico the contribution of marriage to the TFR is still larger than the contribution of <b>consensual</b> <b>union.</b> In Ecuador and Uruguay they have become roughly similar. In Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela the contribution of <b>consensual</b> <b>union</b> to the TFR is larger than that of marriage. Conclusions : In Latin America, fertility, as a component of population change, is less and less related to marriage and increasingly linked to <b>consensual</b> <b>union</b> instead. Comments : We found that not only the contribution of births within <b>consensual</b> <b>union,</b> but also the contribution of out-of-union births to overall fertility has been increasing over time.

40|$|BACKGROUND Remarkably {{little is}} known about the {{significance}} of <b>consensual</b> <b>unions</b> for fertility. This is true everywhere, but the lacuna is more important in the Nordic countries where there is so much childbearing outside of marriage, mostly in <b>consensual</b> <b>unions.</b> The purpose of this paper is to help fill this hole in our knowledge for Finland. OBJECTIVE Unusually good register data enable us to study recent fertility trends by union status (married, cohabiting, neither) using records for some 112, 000 Finnish women, or 11 &#x 160; of all women at fertile ages. METHODS Our description of fertility is based on group-specific duration-based TFRs, which is the number of children borne by a woman who remains in the group throughout her reproductive life, as computed from the fertility rates for a synthetic cohort. This is an intuitively appealing metric that has been taken into systematic use only recently. RESULTS We find substantial fertility differences between women who cohabit, women who marry directly (i. e., without pre-marital cohabitation), and women who marry their cohabitational partner. As one would also expect in Finland, cohabiting women have much lower fertility than married women. The marital TFR is highest among the directly-married and declines monotonically as the length of pre-marital cohabitation increases, even when premarital childbearing is included in the count. As far as we know the latter relationship has not been shown before, because extensive data for complete cohabitational unions have not been available for other populations. CONCLUSIONS The Finnish data are unique, even among the Nordic countries, in that they contain individual-level life histories of family dynamics that cover <b>consensual</b> <b>unions</b> from their very start. Fertility analysis would benefit if data similar to the Finnish were to become available, because analyses that rely on civil status as an indicator of union status barely add anything to what we already know about today?s family dynamics...|$|R

40|$|The three {{essays in}} this {{dissertation}} examine {{issues related to}} the demographic processes of schooling and marriage using longitudinal data from Guatemala. ^ The first paper investigates the effect of age at entry into primary school on schooling outcomes. Delayed entry is a common problem in Guatemala that is believed to be caused by lack of readiness to start school and by economic constraints faced by families. Results indicate that delayed age at entry is strongly associated with lower schooling attainment and higher probability of repeating grades, even when controlling for socioeconomic background and early childhood malnutrition. ^ The second paper analyzes the effect of school attendance and grade achieved to age on the age at first marriage (or <b>consensual</b> <b>union).</b> Descriptive data show that important gender differences in school attendance emerge during the early teen years: girls 2 ̆ 7 dropout rates peak at a younger age than boys 2 ̆ 7. Results from the survival analysis models indicate that both school attendance and schooling attainment are associated with a lower risk of transitioning to marriage at a young age, and that this association is much stronger for females than for males. ^ The third paper explores the determinants of the two types of marital unions that coexist in Guatemala: consensual unions and legal marriages. Results show that women from wealthier families and men with higher levels of education and with jobs that provide social security {{are less likely to be}} in a <b>consensual</b> <b>union.</b> Individuals who profess an evangelical religion are notably less likely to be in a <b>consensual</b> <b>union.</b> Second or higher order unions are more likely to be consensual than first order unions. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} history of family life in northwestern Mexico between 1800 and 1850 through the examination of around 700 state civil and criminal court records from the Sonoran state archives. It demonstrates {{that in spite of}} characterizations of ineptitude and underdevelopment, the local judiciary of Sonora, Mexico, was an important arbiter of social hierarchies based on ethnicity, class, gender and age, where people from across the social spectrum created, reconstituted and challenged these inequalities. Moreover, court proceedings reflect the persisting centrality of colonial law and legal process, as well as the growing influence of liberal ideology on judicial outcomes. Marriage, <b>consensual</b> <b>unions,</b> inheritance, sexuality, intergenerational relationships and hierarchies, children and servants are the central themes of this study. An examination of census data, parish records and court testimonies demonstrates the diversity of family patterns in Sonora {{during the first half of}} the nineteenth century, including large numbers of small farmers, a significant minority of female-headed households, as well as men and women living in <b>consensual</b> <b>unions.</b> These sources suggest that while Sonorans idealized marital fidelity and deference on the part of women and younger kin, and mutual reciprocity among family members, social practice was far more irregular than any regional patriarch could possibly hope.

Curates could no longer use corporal punishment, manage confraternity funds, or undertake church construction projects without a license from the crown.

The regimes have been criticized as positioning widows as mere custodians of property for children, rather than legitimate property owners. Indeed, studies show that a woman's ability to exercise her right to inherited property is largely influenced by whether she {{is viewed as a}} potential agriculturalist. Women are often denied access to inherited property because they do not inherit from their fathers and are not recognized as worthy heads of productive units. Though <b>consensual</b> <b>unions</b> were recognized by the 1988 Constitution, women in <b>consensual</b> <b>unions</b> were not endowed with the same inheritance rights as married women until 1994. With the return to civilian rule in 1985, President José Sarney made the more equitable distribution of land one of his attested objectives, issuing a directive to the Ministry of Agrarian Reform and Land Development in 1986 urging that beneficiaries of land be chose [...] "independently of sex." [...] In conjunction with the democratic opening of the 1980s, a rural women's movement emerged with calls for inclusion of women in rural unions and guarantee of social security benefits, such as paid maternity leave and retirement pensions, for rural women. The National Confederation of Agricultural Workers (CONTAG), which is the largest organization of agricultural workers in Brazil, tackled women's rights for the first time during its fourth congress in 1985, when it decided to extend membership to more women and actively work to end gender discrimination. Demands for more equitable agrarian property rights, championed by organizations such as the Central Workers' Union, the Ministry of Agriculture, the National Women's Council led to agrarian reform measures in the 1988 Constitution. Grievances regarding equal land distribution in Brazil continued, evident in the Marcha da Margaridas of 2000, in which over fifteen thousand women marched on the capital to demand joint allocation of land to couples, rather than just men.The 2003 Civil Code improved women's rights, providing for gender equality in the acquisition, management, and administration of property brought into the ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Colombia {{has been}} {{characterized}} by extreme levels of civil violence throughout {{the latter part of}} the twentieth century, and the burden of excess mortality attributable to this violence has been borne primarily by young men. Populations with a large violent death burden are likely to experience consequences in terms of (1) marriage markets, (2) the dynamics of family formation and dissolution, and (3) patterns of parental investment in offspring. Using data from national censuses and household surveys, we calculate a measure of the marital sex ratio in order to explore the impact of differential male mortality on marriage markets in Colombia. Overall, Colombia is characterized by a female biased sex ratio at all ages. This relative excess of women is particularly pronounced in certain departments of the Central and Pacific regions which have been especially affected by civil violence. We suggest that the low sex ratios which characterized Colombia are partially responsible for the increasingly high frequency of <b>consensual</b> <b>unions</b> and, potentially, female-biased rural-urban migration...|$|R
40|$|Demographers {{have been}} slow to {{reassess}} the value of the traditional concept of marital status. Until the beginning of the 1960 s, a person's living arrangement could be predicted reasonably well by looking at the individual's legal marital status. During the 1980 s, the situation altered dramatically. We know that unmarried couples have always existed; however, in the past they were so rare that little importance was attached to this living arrangement. It was also difficult to study the phenomenon because cohabitation was not yet a generally accepted lifestyle. That is no longer the case. Today, in many European countries many couples live together before marriage, and {{a significant portion of the}} adult population chooses cohabitation instead of marriage. It is therefore no longer possible not to consider <b>consensual</b> <b>unions</b> when studying marital-status or living arrangement structures.
