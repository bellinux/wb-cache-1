5|$|The HPOTP turbine and HPOTP {{pumps are}} {{mounted on a}} common shaft. Mixing of the fuel-rich hot gases in the turbine section and the liquid oxygen in the main pump can create a hazard and, to prevent this, the two {{sections}} are separated by a <b>cavity</b> that is continuously purged by the engine's helium supply during engine operation. Two seals minimize leakage into the cavity; one seal is located between the turbine section and the <b>cavity,</b> while the other is between the pump section and <b>cavity.</b> Loss of helium pressure in this <b>cavity</b> results in automatic engine shutdown.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{respiratory}} organs, {{and both}} cell layers absorb oxygen from and expel carbon dioxide {{into the surrounding}} water. When {{the water in the}} digestive <b>cavity</b> becomes stale it must be replaced, and nutrients that have not been absorbed will be expelled with it. Some Anthozoa have ciliated grooves on their tentacles, allowing them to pump water out of and into the digestive <b>cavity</b> without opening the mouth. This improves respiration after feeding and allows these animals, which use the <b>cavity</b> as a hydrostatic skeleton, to control the water pressure in the <b>cavity</b> without expelling undigested food.|$|E

30|$|<b>Cavities</b> are the radiologic {{hallmark}} of reactivation TB (Miller & Miller 1993). Majority of the <b>cavities</b> usually heal as linear or fibrotic lesions or disappear completely. However, complete anatomical clearing of the <b>cavities</b> after adequate therapy dose not always take place. Some <b>cavities</b> persist even after antituberculous therapy. In 8 of 9 patients with <b>cavities,</b> the <b>cavities</b> became smooth and smaller with linezolid treatment but they persisted. Thus, CT findings of pulmonary TB such as persistent centrilobular nodules, consolidation or <b>cavities</b> may cause confusion regarding pulmonary tuberculosis activity after linezolid treatment.|$|R

A newer polyurethane rubber cast allowed a more detailed study of Tarbosaurus brain structure and function.|$|E
5|$|Another way {{to measure}} {{the speed of light}} is to {{independently}} measure the frequency f and wavelength λ of an electromagnetic wave in vacuum. The value of c can then be found by using the relation c=fλ. One option is to measure the resonance frequency of a <b>cavity</b> resonator. If the dimensions of the resonance <b>cavity</b> are also known, these can be used to determine the wavelength of the wave. In 1946, Louis Essen and A.C. Gordon-Smith established the frequency for a variety of normal modes of microwaves of a microwave <b>cavity</b> of precisely known dimensions. The dimensions were established to an accuracy of about ±0.8μm using gauges calibrated by interferometry. As the wavelength of the modes was known from the geometry of the <b>cavity</b> and from electromagnetic theory, knowledge of the associated frequencies enabled a calculation of the speed of light.|$|E
5|$|Damage to the airways {{can cause}} {{subcutaneous}} emphysema (air {{trapped in the}} subcutaneous tissue of the skin) in the abdomen, chest, neck, and head. Subcutaneous emphysema, present in up to 85% of people with TBI, is particularly indicative of the injury when {{it is only in}} the neck. Air is trapped in the chest <b>cavity</b> outside the lungs (pneumothorax) in about 70% of TBI. Especially strong evidence that TBI has occurred is failure of a pneumothorax to resolve even when a chest tube is placed to rid the chest <b>cavity</b> of the air; it shows that air is continually leaking into the chest <b>cavity</b> from the site of the tear. Air can also be trapped in the mediastinum, the center of the chest <b>cavity</b> (pneumomediastinum). If air escapes from a penetrating injury to the neck, a definite diagnosis of TBI can be made. Hamman's sign, a sound of crackling that occurs in time with the heartbeat, may also accompany TBI.|$|E

Extraction methods for coal, metalliferous minerals and salts are described {{in relation to the}} creation of underground <b>cavities.</b> An outline procedure for locating <b>cavities</b> emphasizes the importance of the desk study in this type of investigation and the difficulty of proving the absence of <b>cavities</b> beneath a site...|$|R

50|$|At a {{high enough}} {{pressure}} the sliding seals between <b>cavities</b> will leak some fluid rather than pumping it, so when pumping against high pressures a longer pump with more <b>cavities</b> is more effective, since each seal {{has only to}} deal with the pressure difference between adjacent <b>cavities.</b> Pumps with between two and a dozen (or so) <b>cavities</b> exist.|$|R

5|$|Die casting is a {{metal casting}} {{process that is}} {{characterized}} by forcing molten metal under high pressure into a mold <b>cavity.</b> The mold <b>cavity</b> is created using two hardened tool steel dies which have been machined into shape and work similarly to an injection mold during the process. Most die castings are made from non-ferrous metals, specifically zinc, copper, aluminium, magnesium, lead, pewter and tin-based alloys. Depending {{on the type of}} metal being cast, a hot- or cold-chamber machine is used.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{irradiated}} material, <b>cavities</b> {{result from}} the condensation of vacancies induced by collision cascades. The study of their formation is a relevant topic since a high density of <b>cavities</b> may alter significantly the material performance. In this work, a simplified version of in line holography was successfully applied for imaging <b>cavities</b> in ion-irradiated 6061 aluminium alloy. In transmission electron microscopy, the incoming electrons experience a phase shift owing to the potential variation induced by the <b>cavities.</b> The retrieval of this phase shift provides a convenient map to observe and highlight the <b>cavities.</b> Information on density of <b>cavities</b> can be easily obtained. In addition, interstitial clusters may also be detected...|$|R

5|$|During osmoregulation, fluid {{is added}} to the pericardia of the branchial hearts. The octopus has two nephridia (equivalent to {{vertebrate}} kidneys) which are associated with the branchial hearts; these and their associated ducts connect the pericardial cavities with the mantle <b>cavity.</b> Before reaching the branchial heart, each branch of the vena cava expands to form renal appendages which are in direct contact with the thin-walled nephridium. The urine is first formed in the pericardial <b>cavity,</b> and is modified by excretion, chiefly of ammonia, and selective absorption from the renal appendages, as it is passed along the associated duct and through the nephridiopore into the mantle <b>cavity.</b>|$|E

5|$|Like other insects, beetles have open circulatory systems, {{based on}} {{hemolymph}} rather than blood. As in other insects, a segmented tube-like heart {{is attached to}} the dorsal wall of the hemocoel.

40|$|AbstractThe {{studies of}} <b>cavities</b> used as refuges are {{necessary}} to develop effective management and conservation plans for native wildlife species and their habitats. There are no previous studies about the variables that influence the use of <b>cavities</b> by pacas (Cuniculus paca) in the Lacandon Rainforest of Chiapas, Mexico. The aims {{of this study were}} to identify distinctive characteristics of <b>cavities</b> used by pacas and to verify if these rodents used the <b>cavities</b> in proportion to their availability. We studied 3 sites with different land use where 42 <b>cavities</b> potentially used by pacas were detected and characterized, the presence of pacas was confirmed in 24 <b>cavities</b> using camera traps. The differences between <b>cavities</b> with and without paca presence were analyzed. In the study area, pacas used <b>cavities</b> underneath roots and inside fallen logs in secondary and riparian vegetation that were within 100 m from water bodies. Pacas are considerably tolerant to anthropogenic disturbances such as land use change, thereby easily adapting to fragmented landscapes...|$|R
5|$|The {{number of}} <b>cavities</b> {{incorporated}} into a mould will directly correlate in moulding costs. Fewer <b>cavities</b> require far less tooling work, so {{limiting the number of}} <b>cavities</b> in-turn will result in lower initial manufacturing costs to build an injection mould.|$|R
50|$|Due to the energetically {{expensive}} {{process of}} excavating new <b>cavities,</b> more energy is expended competing for existing home ranges rather than colonizing new areas.

5|$|Most {{molluscs}} {{have only}} one pair of gills, or even only one gill. Generally, the gills are rather like feathers in shape, although some species have gills with filaments on only one side. They divide the mantle <b>cavity</b> so water enters near the bottom and exits near the top. Their filaments have three kinds of cilia, one of which drives the water current through the mantle <b>cavity,</b> while the other two help to keep the gills clean. If the osphradia detect noxious chemicals or possibly sediment entering the mantle <b>cavity,</b> the gills' cilia may stop beating until the unwelcome intrusions have ceased. Each gill has an incoming blood vessel connected to the hemocoel and an outgoing one to the heart.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the food}} is in the {{digestive}} <b>cavity,</b> gland cells in the gastroderm release enzymes that reduce the prey to slurry, usually within a few hours. This circulates through the digestive <b>cavity</b> and, in colonial cnidarians, through the connecting tunnels, so that gastroderm cells can absorb the nutrients. Absorption may take a few hours, and digestion within the cells may take a few days. The circulation of nutrients is driven by water currents produced by cilia in the gastroderm or by muscular movements or both, so that nutrients reach {{all parts of the}} digestive <b>cavity.</b> Nutrients reach the outer cell layer by diffusion or, for animals or zooids such as medusae which have thick mesogleas, are transported by mobile cells in the mesoglea.|$|E
5|$|Sea anemones {{have what}} can be {{described}} as an incomplete gut; the gastrovascular <b>cavity</b> functions as a stomach and possesses a single opening to the outside, which operates as both a mouth and anus. Waste and undigested matter is excreted through this opening. The mouth is typically slit-like in shape, and bears a groove at one or both ends. The groove, termed a siphonophore, is ciliated, and helps to move food particles inwards and circulate water through the gastrovascular <b>cavity.</b>|$|E

40|$|In this study, we {{compared}} the microleakage of composite fillings cured with halogen bulb, LED and argon ion laser (488 nm). Twenty-four extracted human molars were divided randomly in three groups. Six <b>cavities</b> were prepared on the coronal part of each tooth. Standard <b>cavities</b> (1. 7 x 2 mm) were prepared. <b>Cavities</b> were acid etched, sealed with Scotch Bond 1 and filled by a hybrid composite. <b>Cavities</b> were exposed to one light source, thermocycled and immersed in a 2 % methylene blue dye solution. Dye penetration in the leakage of <b>cavities</b> was recorded using a digital optical microscope. Mean values of percentage of dye penetrations in microleakages of <b>cavities</b> were 49. 303 +/- 5. 178 % for <b>cavities</b> cured with LED, 44. 486 +/- 6. 075 % with halogen bulb and 36. 647 +/- 5. 936 % for those cured by argon laser.

5|$|Since the anemone lacks a rigid skeleton, the {{contractile}} cells pull {{against the}} fluid in the gastrovascular <b>cavity,</b> forming a hydrostatic skeleton. The anemone stabilizes itself by flattening its pharynx which {{acts as a}} valve, keeping the gastrovascular <b>cavity</b> at a constant volume and making it rigid. When the longitudinal muscles relax, the pharynx opens and the cilia lining the siphonoglyphs beat, wafting water inwards and refilling the gastrovascular <b>cavity.</b> In general, the sea anemone inflates its body to extend its tentacles and feed, and deflates it when resting or disturbed. The inflated body {{is also used to}} anchor the animal inside a crevice, burrow or tube.|$|E
