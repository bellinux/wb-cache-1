5000|$|The {{reactor core}} is cylindrical, {{approximately}} 2 ft (0.61 m) high and 15 in in diameter. A 5-in. (12.70-cm)-diameter hole, {{referred to as}} the [...] "flux trap," [...] forms the center of the core. The target is typically loaded with curium-244 and other transplutonium isotopes and is positioned on the reactor vertical axis within the flux trap. The fuel region is composed of two concentric fuel elements. The inner element contains 171 fuel plates, and the outer element contains 369 fuel plates. The fuel plates are curved in the shape of an involute, thus providing a constant <b>coolant</b> <b>channel</b> width. The fuel (93% U235 enriched U3O8-Al cermet pg.22) is non-uniformly distributed along the arc of the involute to minimize the radial peak-to-average power density ratio. A burnable poison (boron-10) is included in the inner fuel element primarily to flatten the radial flux peak providing a longer cycle for each fuel element. The average core lifetime with typical experiment loading is approximately 23 days at 85 MW.|$|E
50|$|As {{the reactor}} heats the water flowing through coolant channels, subcooled {{nucleate}} boiling takes place, {{in which some}} of the water becomes small bubbles of steam on the cladding of the fuel rods. These are then stripped from the fuel cladding and into the <b>coolant</b> <b>channel</b> by the flow of water. Normally, these bubbles collapse in the channel, transferring enthalpy to the surrounding coolant. When the pressure is below the saturation pressure for the given temperature, the bubbles will not collapse. As more bubbles accumulate in the channel and combine, the steam space within the channel becomes larger and larger until steam blankets the fuel cell walls. Once the fuel cell walls are blanketed with steam, {{the rate of heat}} transfer lowers significantly. Heat is not transferred out of the fuel rods as fast as it is being generated, potentially causing a nuclear meltdown. Because of this potential, all nuclear power plants have reactor protection systems that automatically shut down the reactor if the pressure in the primary circuit falls below a safe level, or if the subcooling margin falls below a safe level. Once the reactor is shut down, the rate at which residual heat is generated in the fuel rods {{is similar to that of}} an electric kettle, and the fuel rods can be safely cooled just by being submerged in water at normal atmospheric pressure.|$|E

Two {{different}} CERMET fueled Nuclear Thermal Propulsion reactors were modeled {{to determine}} the optimum <b>coolant</b> <b>channel</b> surface {{area to volume ratio}} required to cool a 25, 000 lbf rocket engine operating at a specific impulse of 940 seconds. Both reactor concepts were computationally fueled with hexagonal cross section fuel elements having a flat-to-flat distance of 3. 51 cm and containing 60 vol. % UO 2 enriched to 93 wt. %U 235 and 40 vol. % tungsten. <b>Coolant</b> <b>channel</b> configuration consisted of a 37 <b>coolant</b> <b>channel</b> fuel element and a 61 <b>coolant</b> <b>channel</b> model representing 0. 3 and 0. 6 surface area to volume ratios respectively.

40|$|The {{horizontal}} <b>coolant</b> <b>channel</b> {{is one of}} {{the important}} parts of primary heat transport system in PHWR type of reactors. There are in all 392 channels in the core of Indian 540 [*]MWe reactor. Each channel houses 13 natural uranium fuel bundles and shielding and sealing plugs one each {{on either side of the}} channel. The heavy water coolant flows through the <b>coolant</b> <b>channel</b> and carries the nuclear heat to outside the core for steam generation and power production in the turbo-generator. India has commissioned one 540 [*]MWe PHWR reactor in September 2005 and another similar unit will be going into operation very shortly. For a complete dynamic study of the channel and its internals under the influence of high coolant flow, experimental and modeling studies have been carried out. A good correlation has been achieved between the results of experimental and analytical models. The operating life of a typical <b>coolant</b> <b>channel</b> typically ranges from 10 to 15 full-power years. Towards the end of its operating life, its health monitoring becomes an important activity. Vibration diagnosis plays an important role as a tool for life management of coolant.

40|$|An {{analytical}} {{investigation on}} the effect of high aspect ratio (height/width) cooling channels, considering different <b>coolant</b> <b>channel</b> designs, on hot-gas-side wall temperature and coolant pressure drop for a liquid hydrogen cooled rocket combustion chamber, was performed. <b>Coolant</b> <b>channel</b> design elements considered were: length of combustion chamber in which high aspect ratio cooling was applied, number of coolant channels, and <b>coolant</b> <b>channel</b> shape. Seven <b>coolant</b> <b>channel</b> designs were investigated using a coupling of the Rocket Thermal Evaluation code and the Two-Dimensional Kinetics code. Initially, each <b>coolant</b> <b>channel</b> design was developed, without consideration for fabrication, to reduce the hot-gas-side wall temperature from a given conventional cooling channel baseline. These designs produced hot-gas-side wall temperature reductions up to 22 percent, with coolant pressure drop increases as low as 7. 5 percent from the baseline. Fabrication constraints for milled channels were applied to the seven designs. These produced hot-gas-side wall temperature reductions of up to 20 percent, with coolant pressure drop increases as low as 2 percent. Using high aspect ratio cooling channels for {{the entire length of the}} combustion chamber had no additional benefit on hot-gas-side wall temperature over using high aspect ratio cooling channels only in the throat region, but increased coolant pressure drop 33 percent. Independent of <b>coolant</b> <b>channel</b> shape, high aspect ratio cooling was able to reduce the hot-gas-side wall temperature by at least 8 percent, with as low as a 2 percent increase in coolant pressure drop. ne design with the highest overall benefit to hot-gas-side wall temperature and minimal coolant pressure drop increase was the design which used bifurcated cooling channels and high aspect ratio cooling in the throat region. An optimized bifurcated high aspect ratio cooling channel design was developed which reduced the hot-gas-side wall temperature by 18 percent and reduced the coolant pressure drop by 4 percent. Reductions of coolant mass flow rate of up to 50 percent were possible before the hot-gas-side wall temperature reached that of the baseline. These mass flow rate reductions produced coolant pressure drops of up to 57 percent...|$|E

The working fluid is freon- 11 with an inlet temperature of 22. 2 C (approximately 21 C subcooling). The <b>coolant</b> <b>channel's</b> exit pressure and mass velocity are 0. 19 M Pa (absolute) and 0. 21 Mg/sq. ms, respectively.

The large pitch fins were also examined with a twisted tape insert. The inside nominal diameter of the copper channels {{at the root of the}} fins was 1. 0 cm. The results show that by adding enhancement devices, boiling occurs almost simultaneously at all axial locations. The case of spiral fins with large pitch resulted in larger mean (circumferentially averaged) heat transfer coefficients, h sub m, at all axial locations.
