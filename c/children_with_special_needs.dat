5|$|In 2011, Lim {{noted that}} the Compulsory Education Act ensures that all {{children}} {{have the opportunity to}} receive an education. However, she expressed concern that processes for entry to schools for <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> were cumbersome. Furthermore, education for <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> was not subject to the same subsidies that students in mainstream schools had. She thus brought to the House's attention the fact that special needs children might have been unintentionally marginalized. These concerns were supported by Penny Low, MP for Pasir Ris–Punggol GRC.|$|E

5|$|In May 2011, {{the first}} rushes of Ra.One {{were shown to}} the cast of Khan's other home {{production}} Always Kabhi Kabhi (2011). Subsequently, the film was screened for test audiences to study and gauge the film's appeal across different age groups. A few days prior to the theatrical release, Khan arranged a special screening of the film's final cut in Yash Raj Studios, where he invited close friends, his family and the film's crew. Between 24 and 26 October 2011, Ra.One had international premieres in Dubai, London and Toronto, {{all of which were}} chosen due to their international significance and large South Asian populations. The premiere in Dubai was held on 24 October 2011 at the Grand Cinemas, Wafi. A high-profile dinner and charity auction followed, where Khan raised AED30,000 (approximately US$8,200) to build a workshop for <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>special</b> <b>needs.</b> The premiere included three simultaneous screenings of the film, for which tickets were placed on sale for the public.

40|$|Birth of a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> has a {{big impact}} on the family {{dynamics}} and it affects every family member. Family urgently needs help and support with the adaptation process and with the balance reestablishment, but it often occurs that siblings remain lonely and overlooked, especially from the experts. With the systematic examination of the literature we wanted to research the problems and emotions with which the siblings have to confront, what are their needs, and finally propose the framework for helping siblings in their childhood. In the first part we have focused on the dynamics, organization and adaptation of the family <b>with</b> the <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>special</b> <b>needs,</b> because all this also affects the siblings. Everything parents experience, siblings experience also, but their needs are nevertheless not completely identical. Consecutively we have in the second part researched the problems, emotions and needs of the siblings and investigated what systems of help and support for the siblings already exist in Slovenia and in the world. We have concluded that having a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> greatly affects the whole family. How the family will adapt to different life depends on different factors {{on the side of the}} <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>special</b> <b>needs,</b> their siblings, parents and extended community. Siblings need information and support when they are growing up and also when they are older. They have to face different positive and negative emotions and experiences, with which they need the help of the family and the experts. Review of the programs and services has shown that there is not enough programs in Slovenia which would offer help and support to the siblings of the <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>special</b> <b>needs.</b> ...|$|R

30|$|The {{existing}} literature on <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>special</b> educational <b>needs</b> outside Tanzania {{has focused on}} conceptualization of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>special</b> educational <b>needs</b> and their diversity (Farrel 2003; DfES 2009; Hallahan and Kauffman 2003; Halliwell 2003). Some authors {{emphasize the importance of}} identifying <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>special</b> educational <b>needs</b> so as to plan for their intervention services (Bender and Shores 2007); to intervene before they fail (Hus 2001); and to facilitate their proper development alongside their typical growing peers (Fabian and Dunlop 2007). Similarly, available literature on <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>special</b> educational <b>needs</b> in Tanzania focuses on the taxonomy of services to these children (segregation, integration, and inclusion) (HAKIELIMU 2008; MOEVT 2016). Despite the fact that the impossibility of providing effective care and services to young <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>special</b> educational <b>needs</b> without establishing collaborative relationship with families is acknowledged (Klein et al. 2001), very few studies have been done in Tanzania to examine professional-parents relationship.
