500|$|Throughout {{the period}} of the 52nd's existence, the British Army {{comprised}} both infantry and cavalry line regiments, as well as the Household Divisions. The regiments of the line were numbered and, from 1781, were given territorial designations – [...] "Oxfordshire" [...] in the 52nd's case – which roughly represented the area from which troops were drawn. This was not rigid, and most English regiments had a significant proportion of Irish and Scots. Regiments comprised at least one battalion, often two – as the 52nd did intermittently – and occasionally more. Commanded by a lieutenant colonel, an infantry battalion was composed of ten companies, of which eight were [...] "centre" [...] companies, and two flank companies: one a grenadier and one (in regular line regiments) a specialist light <b>company.</b> <b>Companies</b> were commanded by captains, with lieutenants and ensigns (or subalterns) beneath him. Ideally, a battalion comprised 1000 men (excluding NCOs, musicians and officers); the 1st (or senior) battalion of a regiment would frequently draw fit recruits from the 2nd battalion to maintain its strength. If also sent on active service, the 2nd battalion would consequently be weaker. In periods of long service, battalions were generally operating under strength. Seriously under-strength battalions might be dissolved, or temporarily drafted into other regiments, as happened to the 52nd on several occasions.|$|E

2500|$|What {{types of}} speech workers are {{protected}} from being fired for on social networking websites {{has been an}} issue for American companies with over 100 complaints as of 2011 on this topic having been made to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).

2500|$|... 1st Battalion {{spent a week}} in {{the line}} near High Wood at the end of August during which time it endured the most intense {{shelling}} it experienced in the whole war. After three days the trenches were practically obliterated, forcing the men into the shell holes in front of them, {{and by the time the}} battalion was relieved on 28 August it had lost 46 killed and 141 wounded. The battalion returned to the line in front of High Wood on 8 September, and at 18:00, with 2nd Battalion Welch Regiment on their right and 9th Battalion Black Watch on their left, attacked into the wood. One platoon of A Company was practically wiped out before the company reached the German second line, and on its right fierce fighting severely weakened B Company before it was eventually able to join A <b>Company.</b> <b>Companies</b> C and D following in support took many casualties, and only a few of these men made it to the objective unwounded. As it consolidated its gains the battalion continued to take casualties, and heavy shelling also took a toll of the wounded making their way back to the rear lines. Lacking reinforcement, the survivors were ordered to withdraw, and by 22:00 they were back in their original trenches, from which, at 03:00 on 9 September, they repulsed a German counter-attack. Casualties to the battalion in the action around High Wood were 5 officers killed and 8 wounded – amongst whom was the commanding officer Lieutenant-Colonel Pagan – and 84 other ranks killed and 122 wounded, leaving the battalion with just 4 officers and 96 other ranks fit for duty.|$|E
