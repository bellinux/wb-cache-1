50|$|The {{process of}} banking <b>cartelisation</b> {{took place in}} {{conjunction}} with the regulatory change and the conflicts generated by the governmental policies. The situation created after the first banking law of 1921 and the simultaneous creation of the banking cartel (Banking Control Council-Consejo Superior Bancario or CSB), generated a series of defence mechanisms put in place by the savings banks. The most important of these was the creation of regional federations of savings banks. Bank federations in Spain emerged as a response to regulatory changes that modified the otherwise equal framework for business under which private commercial and savings banks could compete. Led by the Basque-Navarre federation in 1924, the Galician Federation, the Levante Federation, the Catalan-Aragonese-Balearic Federation, the Western Federation, the Castilian Federation, the Asturian Federation, and the Federation of Savings Banks in Andalusia. These were then to ammalgamate in 1928 and create the Confederation of Spanish Savings Banks (Confederación Española de Cajas de Ahorros, abbreviated as CECA).|$|E
50|$|An {{economic}} {{analysis of the}} law holds very simply that any intervention in a contract between two parties creates an inefficient labour market. Wages kept artificially high, by imposing any administrative or monetary costs on employers distorts the labour market equilibrium. For a national economy in a globalised world, that means jobs will go overseas and the unemployment rate rises. Major proponents {{of this sort of}} labour economics include Nobel Prize winner from the University of Chicago, Professor Gary Becker. Professor Becker keeps a blog with well-known academic and judge, Richard Posner. Posner is a lawyer and economist, and wrote a book called Economic Analysis of Law. His starting assumption is that unions are the <b>cartelisation</b> of the labour market. Both would agree, that if its aim is to improve the living standards of society, wage regulation defeats itself. Posner says, “Economics is not a theory about consciousness. Behaviour is rational when it conforms to the model of rational choice, whatever the state of mind of the chooser.” So any conscious attempt to improve working standards are impossible under this view.|$|E
5000|$|He is {{father of}} the concept of the {{catch-all}} party. Otto Kirchheimer's conception of the catch-all party was part of his more comprehensive theory of party transformation, encompassing four interrelated political processes. By tracing the development of the catch-all thesis and placing it within the wider context of Kirchheimer's complete work, it is possible to reconstruct a more precise understanding of what Kirchheimer meant by the catch-all concept, which itself remains highly contested. Kirchheimer's anxiety about modern democracy originated with what he saw as the vanishing of principled opposition within parliament and society, and the reduction of politics to the mere management of the state. This leads to collusion of political parties and the state, severing of the societal links of party organisations, and erosion of the classic separation of powers. Vanishing opposition, <b>cartelisation</b> and professionalisation of politics pits citizens against a powerful state, which increases political cynicism and apathy. Kirchheimer's comprehensive approach remains relevant to much of the contemporary debate about the transformation of Western political systems.

50|$|TASMAC was {{established}} in 1983 by the Chief Minister M. G. Ramachandran (MGR) for wholesale vending of alcohol in Tamil Nadu. The state {{has a long history}} of prohibition, first implemented partially in 1937 by the Indian National Congress government of C. Rajagopalachari. Between 1973 and 2001, it was lifted briefly during 1971-74, 1981-87 and 1990-91. After 1983, TASMAC was in charge of wholesale liquor sales in the state whenever prohibition was lifted. In 2001, prohibition was lifted again and TASMAC became the wholesale monopoly for alcohol. For retail vending, the state auctioned off licenses for running liquor shops and bars. But this led to the formation of cartels and loss of revenue to the state. The government tried to counter this by introducing a lot system from the financial year 2001-02, where potential bidders bid for shops grouped by revenue. But the lot system could not prevent <b>cartelisation,</b> as bidders later withdrew in favour of others. In October 2003, the government passed an amendment to the Tamil Nadu Prohibition Act, 1937, making TASMAC the sole retail vendor of alcohol in the state. By 2004 all private outlets selling alcohol were either shut down or taken over by the company. This monopoly established by the ADMK government of J. Jayalalitha came into effect on 29 November 2003. The DMK government of M. Karunanidhi which took power in 2006, did not revise its predecessor's policy and TASMAC continues to control the alcohol industry in the state.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} defection {{into the}} strategic R&D model. In defecting, a firm cheats by choosing its R&D expenditures to maximise its own profits, instead of maximising the joint profits of the cooperating firms. Two cooperative environments are considered: R&D <b>cartelisation,</b> where firms coordinate R&D activities; and RJV <b>cartelisation,</b> where firms coordinate R&D activities and share information. Under R&D <b>cartelisation,</b> defection entails an increase (decrease) in R&D and effective spillovers for low (high) spillovers; whereas under RJV <b>cartelisation,</b> defection always entails {{a decrease in}} R&D and effective spillovers. Under R&D <b>cartelisation,</b> consumer surplus and total welfare increase (decrease) with defection when spillovers are low (high). Whereas consumer surplus and welfare always decrease with defection under RJV <b>cartelisation.</b> Under R&D <b>cartelisation,</b> the incentives for defection first decrease then increase with spillovers; they also increase {{with the size of}} the market, but decline with production costs and R&D costs. Moreover, the incentives for defection are higher under RJV <b>cartelisation.</b> With low spillovers under RJV <b>cartelisation,</b> a firm prefers to be subject to defection by the other firm, to not cooperating at all. Punishment for defection is considered, under the form of abstaining from information sharing. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd/ University of Adelaide and Flinders University 2006. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we ask whether OPEC still gains from <b>cartelisation</b> {{in the oil}} market despite low {{producer}} prices and a modest market share. We apply two intertemporal equilibrium models of the global oil market; one consisting of a cartel and a fringe, and one describing a hypothetical competitive market. Comparing the outcome of these models we conclude that there are positive <b>cartelisation</b> gains of about 18 per cent in the oil market. In comparison with what Pindyck (1978) found for the 1970 s this may be considered as quite modest. Moreover, we study whether the <b>cartelisation</b> gains to OPEC are altered by different moves by non-OPEC producers or consumer countries. Generally, {{we find that the}} relative <b>cartelisation</b> gains are unchanged. One exception is exploration activities, where we find that a major increase in non-OPEC reserves could remove the <b>cartelisation</b> gains to OPEC completely. In this case, the OPEC-countries could find themselves better off without the cartel. <b>Cartelisation</b> Gains; Petroleum Wealth; Exhaustible Resources. ...|$|E

Scholarly studies show that firms and governments often cooperated in the settlement and administration of many cartels during the inter-war period.

In its current form, s 73 A has several weaknesses which will negatively impact competition enforcement; particularly the leniency policy which is the Commission’s most effective weapon against <b>cartelisation.</b> The emergence of follow-on damages litigation as a legal remedy and class actions as a procedural mechanism in the bread class action, have paved the way for private competition enforcement as a more effective deterrent.

The possibility to contest planned regulation {{in the political arena}} is given as an outside option of the bargaining model. Policy instruments differ in their impacts on firms' profits and market shares, which yields different incentives for technology adoption. Furthermore, means of direct regulation may lead to an implicit <b>cartelisation</b> of the industry. This latter feature shapes the actors' equilibrium threat position, which, in turn, influences incentives to contest the regulation and the subsequent regulatory outcome.

40|$|The {{enforcement}} {{record of}} the 1990 s has demonstrated that international private cartels are neither relics of the past nor do they always fall quickly {{under the weight of}} their own incentive problems. Of a sample of forty cartels prosecuted by the United States and European Inion in the 1990 s, twenty-four cartels lasted at least four years. And for the twenty of the cartels in this sample where sales data are available, the annual worldwide sales in the affected products exceeded US$ 30 billion. Prevailing national competition policies are oriented towards addressing harm done in domestic markets, and in some cases merely prohibit cartels without taking strong enforcement measures. In this paper we propose a sequence of reforms to national policies and to international cooperation that will strengthen the deterrents against international cartels. Furthermore, aggressive prosecution of cartels must be complemented by vigilance in other areas of competition policy. If not, firms will respond to the enhanced deterrents to <b>cartelisation</b> by merging or by taking other measures that lessen competitive pressures.

40|$|This paper {{stresses}} {{the negative impact}} that the excessive levels of transparency imposed by public procurement rules can have on competition for public contracts and, more generally, on the likelihood of <b>cartelisation</b> of the markets where public procurement takes place. The paper critically assesses some recent Judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the General Court from this perspective and shows how the top EU Courts are still oblivious {{to the fact that}} excessive transparency may diminish the effectiveness of procurement by reducing competition. It also indicates that the case law itself has unused balancing tools that may help reduce the negative impact of excessive transparency, particularly if coupled with a reduction of the financial incentives offered to litigants that have no other claim than a 'mere' lack of compliance with full transparency. The paper concludes that a reform in the enforcement and oversight mechanisms oriented towards the setting up of a semi-opaque review system would overcome some of the deficiencies identified in the current case law from a law and economics perspective.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{restructuring}} of the Asia-Pacific iron ore market {{in the wake of}} the rise of the Chinese steel industry. Prior to the 2000 s, this market was characterised by two key features-high firm-level concentration on both the producer and consumer sides, and price determination through annually negotiated benchmark pricing between Australian mining and Japanese steel firms. However, owing to rapid growth in the Chinese steel industry and its emergence as the region's principal iron ore consumer, the Asia-Pacific iron ore market has been dramatically restructured during the last decade. This process has been accelerated since 2005 by Chinese governmental resource security policies, which have sought to address current record high iron ore prices through the use of foreign investment to sponsor new market entrants and the formation of an import cartel amongst the Chinese steel firms. This paper evaluates how these policies have driven restructuring in the Asia-Pacific iron ore market, through an analysis of the growth of China's steel industry, Chinese resource security policies aimed at lowering iron ore import costs, and their effects upon the regional market's ownership structure and price determination mechanisms. It argues that while Chinese investment and <b>cartelisation</b> policies have catalysed significant changes to the ownership and pricing structures of the Asia-Pacific iron ore market, they have carried only mixed benefits for the Chinese steel industry's resource security...|$|E
40|$|Some {{fifty years}} after its {{creation}} EU competition policy remains firmly entrenched {{as one of the}} most developed examples of supranational governance within the European Union. Although there has been a marked increase in interest among political scientists in competition policy in recent years there are still gaps in terms of overall coverage. One area that has been largely overlooked centres on cartels. Cartel policy has emerged as a highly salient issue and main priority of the Commission’s competition policy since the late 1990 s. Certainly, the recent restructuring of the EU cartel enforcement regime, the imposition of ever higher fines and a determined EU Competition Commissioner have fuelled growing media attention while new notices and regulations increasingly occupy the interests and minds of practitioners. The European Commission has constantly extended its activities on the competition policy front and its increasingly aggressive strategies to combat cartels provides political scientists with a fascinating case study of governance in action and illustrates the ways – such as leniency programmes, higher fines, enhanced and better equipped resources as well as internal reorganisation in which the European regulator is pursuing such conspiracies.

This thesis analyses how the United States repudiated the establishment of a new economic order within the framework of three special sessions of the UNGA: the sixth in 1974; the seventh in 1975; and the eleventh in 1980. It analyses the behaviour of the US by focusing on the position and rhetorical argumentation used in verbal communication. The thesis argues that their tactical behaviour differed in each session, albeit having the same intention: restraint of NIEO to safeguard the (old) economic order. The US’ rhetoric remained consistent and attempted to convince third world countries that measures affiliated with NIEO, e. g. raw materials <b>cartelisation</b> and international price-fixing would not contribute to enhance their development. The hegemonic position of the US, both in terms of military and economic capacity make up the reason for why NIEO was never successfully implemented. It is concluded that the behaviour of the US in the sixth special session, in which they refused to accept the NIEO, effectively left the new order dead on the day of its adoption...|$|E

The use of such technologies, which contain a host of information about voters and their policy preferences, are a potentially useful conduit between citizens and their elected representatives. Instead, their development has been veiled in secrecy, and their operation puts vast public resources to use for partisan ends, invades the privacy of constituents seeking help from their member of parliament, and tilts electoral politics towards the minority of swinging voters.

First, electronic democracy must not discriminate against those political parties without the resources of thestate to support their infrastructure and operation. Information technology has hitherto provided advantages to established political parties, which have the resources to properly exploit it.

Political parties will inevitably attempt to skew any new system to their own advantage.

40|$|The {{economics}} of {{information has been}} studiously ignored in the ten Conferences of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity. Nevertheless, an academic literature exists which recognises genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge as natural and artificial information. Its unambiguous prescriptions would widen {{the scope of the}} Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and Benefit Sharing (ABS) and resolve almost all of the contentious issues identified by Kamau et al. One begins with retroactivity: because biological resources exhibit tangible and intangible aspects, the latter can be conceptualised as a set of natural information where value currently added in a patent is access to a subset not previously accessed. The economics quickly leads to a justification for a biodiversity cartel among countries of origin, wholly analogous to monopoly intellectual property rights. To achieve such a sea change in policymaking, the justification must be accompanied by a narrative that can penetrate the social sphere, much as Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights achieved through the World Intellectual Property Organisation. Several examples of bio-discoveries drawn from a popular medium are analysed in terms of the contentious issues of the Protocol and the distinct ABS that would eventuate under <b>cartelisation.</b> History also offers an analogy.

Including environmental considerations at {{the early stages of}} policy-making, as well as acknowledging usage inter-dependencies and their impact on ecosystems, has led to the multiplication of localised participatory policies and multi-stakeholder platforms. In that context, the objective of the PhD is twofold. It aims to analyse how local politics, through political parties, influences those new participatory forms of management, especially in the implementation of EU environmental directives. On the other hand, it explores how the diffusion of participatory norms of governance affects the strategies of political parties. The results show that electoral position and territorial levels strongly condition the local politics of participatory governance. It also provides evidence that collaborative management reduces formal accountability and parties’ political discretion. In that sense, it confirms the <b>cartelisation</b> hypothesis: parties’ governing functions are strengthened, while participatory provisions have relocated the representation of interests outside the party system. The thesis highlights the positive effects of participation and holistic environmental approaches in terms of social regulation and transparency, especially in long-established national administrations. Yet, it questions its environmental strength, namely its capacity to solve deeply entrenched distributive dilemmas and the exclusiveness of social groups’ stakes. Even if multi-stakeholder participation must be appreciated as an empowering and more sustainable process, it is essential that practitioners and academics alike deal with its limitations and political ambiguities...|$|E
