40|$|To {{light the}} {{production}} of J. B., the lighting designer is required to use {{a great variety of}} mounting positions, instruments, and color media. It follows that great flexibility of dimmer control is required. The problem of this thesis is to design and execute the lighting of the University Theatre production of J. B. so that the lighting {{is an integral part of}} the production and not a separate entity. The lighting must reflect immediately the subtleties of the intention of the original artist, Archibald MacLeish, and his subsequent interpreters, the director and designer. To approach this task, the following steps were taken: (1) Repeated line readings and meetings with the director. (2) A study of past productions of J. B. (3) An analysis of the script in the Aristotelian terms of plot, <b>character,</b> <b>theme,</b> <b>language,</b> rhythm, and spectacle. (4) Conferences with the director and designer to understand their interpretations of these Aristotelian terms for the play. (5) All the drawing and construction necessary for the execution of the lighting. (6) The supervision of the mounting and focusing of the instruments; also, supervision of color media in the instruments and light intensities. (7) The selection of qualified critics to evaluate the lighting as it appears during production. (8) An analysis of the critics’ reactions to the lighting of the play. The end goal of this project is simply to create a lighting design in harmony with a particular director of a specific production J. B. at the University of Nebraska Theatre. Advisor: William R.

40|$|Student editions, {{edited by}} Deidre Osborne A Raisin in the Sun {{is a classic}} American play: a {{groundbreaking}} 1950 s civil rights drama and has a strong {{claim to be the}} greatest play of the black American experience. Deeply committed to the black struggle for equality and human rights, Lorraine Hansberry's brilliant career as a writer was cut short by her death when she was only 34. A Raisin in the Sun was the first play written by a black woman to be produced on Broadway and won the New York Drama Critics Circle Award. Hansberry was the youngest and the first black writer to receive this award. She was also the first person to be called 'young, gifted and black'. The play is set in south side Chicago, where Walter Lee, a black chauffeur, dreams of a better life, and hopes to use his father's life insurance money to open a liquor store. Humane and heart-rending, the play depicts characters and a whole society with complexity and reality. This Student Edition features expert and helpful annotation, including a scene-by-scene summary, a detailed commentary on the dramatic, social and political context, and on the <b>themes,</b> <b>characters,</b> <b>language</b> and structure of the play, as well as a list of suggested reading and questions for further study and a review of performance histor...|$|R
