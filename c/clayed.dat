30|$|Expansibility {{is one of}} the {{important}} physical properties of <b>clay.</b> On the one hand, the porosity of <b>clay</b> deteriorates after <b>clay</b> absorbs water and expands making it relatively impermeable.

5000|$|The {{original}} house, {{designed by}} an unknown architect, was two storeys high, 60 by 40 feet (18 m × 12 m) in area, with a low hipped roof containing a circular window.

They are 12-over-12 sash on the main floor and 8-over-8 sash on the second. The front door has a moulded reveal and a semi-circular fanlight, with separate sidelights.

50|$|The British {{infantry}} uniforms at {{that date}} were red jackets, dark blue trousers with red piping to the side, white pith helmets and pipe <b>clayed</b> equipment, {{a stark contrast}} to the African landscape. The Highlanders wore the kilt. The standard infantry weapon was the Martini-Henry single-shot breech-loading rifle with a long sword bayonet. Gunners of the Royal Artillery wore blue jackets. The Boer marksmen could easily snipe at British troops from a distance. The Boers carried no bayonets, leaving them at a substantial disadvantage in close combat, which they avoided as often as possible. Drawing on years of experience of fighting frontier skirmishes with numerous and indigenous African tribes, they relied more on mobility, stealth, marksmanship and initiative while the British emphasised the traditional military values of command, discipline, formation and synchronised firepower. The average British soldier was not trained to be a marksman and got little target practice. What shooting training British soldiers had was mainly as a unit firing in volleys on command.|$|E
5000|$|The two-domed {{classical}} one-story dwelling houses {{date back}} to the 17th-18th century. The dwelling houses consisting of two or more rooms were built according to a social and economic status of the family. Most of the dwelling houses built in the territory of Gala were the two-domed constructions. The key reasons for building such type of dwellings were climatic conditions, lack of wood and abundance of limestone deposits. The one-story house consists of two rooms. On the flat surface of the roof, there are two dome-shaped chimneys and a stone drain. The roof surface was <b>clayed.</b> The utility room has a tandir and a hearth for cooking.

30|$|The authigenic <b>clay</b> mineral cements are {{postulated}} to neo-formed from post-depositional, infiltrated allogenic <b>clay</b> minerals.

The allogenic <b>clay</b> minerals are infiltrated by meteoric water during rain or flood events into semi-consolidated sands (Worden and Morad 2003; McKie et al. 2010), where fractures and disaggregation bands increase the infiltration depth (Fig.  12).
