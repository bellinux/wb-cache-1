A way to increase fuel burn-up is to diminish the elements internal pressure by adequate UO 2 fuel pellet structure (large grain or controlled <b>closed</b> <b>porosity),</b> hi the large grain size UO 2 pellets, fission gas release rate decreases and the elements internal pressure increase slowly.
