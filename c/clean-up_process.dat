2500|$|Art therapy {{may be a}} {{beneficial}} treatment for incarcerated women. A residential substance abuse program called New Beginnings in a detention facility has used art therapy {{as a means of}} treatment for incarcerated women. The therapy sessions were weekly and lasted 2 hours. During the first 15 minutes of the art therapy session, the topic of therapy was discussed. The topics were self-esteem, fear, self-defeating behaviors, treatment goals, barriers for recovery, and self-sabotage. The clients then worked on an exercise relating to the topic for 45 minutes in tables of four. Exploring deeper thoughts, positive reinforcement and feedback, confidence building, and clarification of thinking were encouraged by the art therapist. The clients were resistant at first, claiming [...] "I can't draw." [...] However, they began to share their works and offer insight on other inmates' work after one or two sessions. Group cohesion increased after the inmates began expressing different perspectives on their work and others. Simple art media was offered, to ensure that the <b>clean-up</b> <b>process</b> and technique of the materials was not difficult or intimidating. Art therapy in the program was used to help clients recognize their defense mechanisms that conceal their fear of inadequacy or {{to create a sense of}} safety and peace, increase confidence, express feelings verbally, and identify feelings. Therefore, art therapy can be used as a tool in incarceration settings with women for mental health and substance abuse.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the chemisorption efficiency of SPIONs, biopolymers such as chitosan {{can be used to}} coat the nanoparticles. Chitosan is an abundant biodegradable biopolymer available in the nature, which can be extracted from the exoskeletons of marine organisms such as crabs, lobsters, shrimps as well as fungi. Literature studies have suggested that chitosan is more efficient than its precursor chitin (Boddu et al. 2003). The free amine groups present on the surface of chitosan aid in the chemisorption of the metal ions and subsequently result in their removal from wastewater (Kaveeshwar et al. 2018). The coating of chitosan on SPIONs makes it less toxic to the environment resulting in an eco-friendly method of heavy metal removal. This use of nanoparticles in this method is highly cost-effective process (Gill et al. 2017) and hence can be executed in a large-scale <b>clean-up</b> <b>processes.</b> In this study, SPIONs were synthesized by chemical method, coated with chitosan and utilized for chromium removal from water.|$|R

30|$|High {{performance}} {{liquid chromatography}} (HPLC) {{is the most}} common assay technique used in studies of beta-lactam TDM [16, 45, 99 – 102]. Verdier et al. [110] developed an HPLC assay method specifically targeting the needs of routine TDM application, thus enabling simultaneous determination of 12 beta-lactams within 22 minutes. Another robust HPLC method described by McWhinney et al. [111] analyzed 12 antibiotics simultaneously within a 7 -minute run time. HPLC is, however, a relatively slow technique that requires extensive sample preparation and <b>clean-up</b> <b>processes</b> and, thus, is not suitable for urgent assay needs [112, 113]. The relative cost and requirement of specialized instrumentation also is another drawback compared with other techniques, such as immunochemical assays, which use cheaper, portable, and easy-to-use instrumentations [114]. Immunochemical assays have been used for other antibiotics for which routine TDM is well established, such as aminoglycosides and vancomycin [115, 116]. However, the development of such techniques for beta-lactams has been a challenge [117, 118]. To date, no technique allows simple and rapid determination of unbound beta-lactam plasma concentration, which is ideally required for TDM.|$|R
40|$|Accelerated solvent {{extraction}} (ASE) {{has been successfully}} used {{in the analysis of}} a wide range of chemicals from many sample matrices. However, the main problem with accelerated {{solvent extraction}} is low selectivity towards the analyte because during the extraction process, many interfering components are co-extracted together with target analytes and thus requires post-extraction <b>clean-up</b> <b>processes.</b> In this study, a selective accelerated solvent extraction with clean-up step incorporated inside the extraction cell was developed for the analysis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and sterols in soil. PAHs (naphthalene, acenaphtene, anthracene, pyrene) and sterols (coprostanol, cholesterol, stigmasterol, stigmastanol) were extracted separately using two elution steps. The selectivity and efficiency of this approach were evaluated using several sorbents and proper choice of solvents. Using polar sorbents, PAHs were recovered in the first extraction using n-hexane while sterols were recovered in the second extraction using a more polar solvent such as methanol, isopropanol, acetone and mixture of DCM:MeOH (40 : 60, v/v). Recoveries for PAHs ranged from 76. 5 - 99. 2 % and sterols from 83. 7. 7 - 91. 4 % using silica as the sorbent, n-hexane as the first eluent, and methanol as the second eluent...|$|R
40|$|Aims: The aims of {{this study}} were to produce {{activated}} carbon from refuse derived fuel (RDF) and to examine its efficiency in dioxins and furans (PCDD/F) removal for application in the adsorptive processes of waste incineration. Materials and Methods: In the present study the RDF was carbonized at 600 °C to produce char and the char was then steam activated at 900 °C to generate activated carbon (AC). The efficiency of the produced AC in PCDD/F removal from simulated flue gas was investigated using a bench scale static-bed reactor. Experiments were conducted under flue gas stream at 275 °C using a standard flyash (BCR- 490) as a source of PCDD/F. The PCDD/F content of the exhaust gas was trapped by XAD-II resin, and after extraction and <b>clean-up</b> <b>processes,</b> were analyzed using a GC coupled with a triple quadrupole mass spectrophotometer (MS). Results: The results showed an overall reduction of 85 % and 43 % in the flue gas concentration of PCDD and PCDF, respectively, which compared favourably with a commercial AC. In addition, reduction was varied throughout the congener groups of these compounds. Conclusions: The AC derived from the pyrolysis of RDF therefore shows potential as a control material for dioxins and furans in waste combustion process...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Hydrogen (H 2) {{production}} is gaining popularity among researchers {{for a better}} future environment. Hydrogen, which {{is known as the}} cleanest fuel, is also an excellent candidate to replace existing fuels. Its high flammability and energy produced with no side product make it even more popular. In this study, a steady-state model simulation is developed to describe a butane fuel processor by autothermal reforming (ATR) to provide H 2 for fuel-cell application. The objective of the study is to develop a general steady-state simulation of an H 2 production plant for fuel cell application using butane as the feedstock.

Moreover, the usefulness of accurate, full scan MS and MS/MS spectra to screen and to confirm the presence of additional OPs, without using reference standards, in sludge samples is discussed. Matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD) was used as sample preparation technique. Under optimised conditions, MSPD provided quantitative recoveries for the group of targeted analytes, requiring just 15 mL of solvent and integrating extraction and <b>clean-up</b> <b>processes</b> in the same step. For these species, the achieved limits of quantification (LOQs) varied between 2 and 50 ng g− 1 and the efficiency of electrospray ionization (ESI) did not change significantly between pure standards and sludge extracts. Among targeted OPs, tri(chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCPP), tributoxyethyl phosphate (TBEP) and triphenyl phosphate (TPP) were ubiquitous in sludge.

40|$|AbstractIn this {{collaborative}} {{study of the}} Universities Jena and Clausthal and the GDF SUEZ E&P Deutschland {{within the framework of}} the R&D program “CLEAN“Rotliegend sandstones of the Altmark natural gas field were investigated by sedimentological, mineralogical, geochemical and petrophysical means. In compilating the gained results potential correlations of specific rock attributes should be evaluated, to support the implementation of a planned EGR project. Therefore, as some kind of natural analogue for potential fluid-rock interactions during EGR, varied colored and altered sandstone types, which are most likely affected by such processes in the past, were analyzed. Preliminary results confirm subtle to major differences in mineralogical and geochemical rock composition, as well as petrophysical differences, due to rock colors and litho- and diagenetic facies types. All the rocks are characterized by early diagenetic sebkha/playa calcite and anhydrite cementation and varying amounts of hematitic-clayey clast rimming cutans. Varying degrees of cement dissolution and (partial) cutan recrystallization (?) during diagenesis resulted in different rock porosities and permeabilities. Highest porosity and permeability is typical for aeolian type sandstones and altered (bleached) rock types. Analysis of irreducible water saturation suggests that during injection large pressure gradients in the near-wellbore area are likely. Thus effects of mobilization of the gas and the water phase in the near-wellbore zone due to high pressure gradients and CO 2 induced mineralogical dissolution effects could facilitate <b>clean-up</b> <b>processes</b> and increase the injectivity of CO 2 injection wells in the Altmark...|$|R

Using this technique, methylmercury, ethylmercury and phenylmercury and some unknown organomercury species were found in soil samples collected from the sites of an old mercury products producing plant. With regard to risk assessment, it is necessary to assess the toxicity of the organomercurials. As different microbial metabolic pathways react differently to mercury and its compounds, batteries of bioassays are, therefore, useful to evaluate the toxicity of pollutants.

Furthermore, the off-gases produced are easily handled by conventional gas <b>clean-up</b> <b>processes</b> in order to achieve environmental emission compliance. This research explores the pyrolysis of hydrocarbon rich refinery residues, left over from crude oil and other crude fraction conversion processes, in a 1200 liter electrically-heated batch retort. It also provides the novel offering of a cost effective and environmentally compliant method of assessing the recovery potential of valuable products. The process design has been formulated by careful consideration of key aspects of previous work cited in literature. The pyrolysis of the residue has shown significant oil (70 %), char (14 %) and non-condensable gas (6 % by difference) yields. The oil yield obtained shows a remarkably high calorific value (~ 40 MJ/kg), comparable to that of standard liquid fuels. The char obtained, with high carbon content (~ 80 %), could be a candidate for a solid fuel source. The non-condensable gas stream possesses significant calorific value (240 KJ/mol, estimated) implying the potential generation of an additional heating source. The non-condensable gas stream was subjected to an oxidative process prior to gas clean-up, and continuous on-line monitoring of the vented gas demonstrated compliance with South African emission guidelines. The gas treatment is economically optimal as only a smaller portion of the original residue is subjected to emission-controlling steps.

40|$|There are {{millions}} of acres of chemically contaminated lands on which biofuel crops can be planted for dual purposes of biomass production and land reclamation. Phytoremediation is a proven technology for environmental cleanup, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical environments. There are advantages in that multiple growing seasons and increased soil temperature accelerate the <b>clean-up</b> <b>processes.</b> Seeds of 13 tropical and temperate plant species were germinated and grown for 10 days in petroleum contaminated soil containing 3148 μg/g of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The results indicate that the presence of PAHs enhanced both emergence and early seedling growth with some of the species tested. Kiawe tree germination rate was 7 -fold higher in PAH soils than that in the control media. The potential biofuel grasses sugarcane, banagrass, switch grass, vetiver and miscanthus showed degradation of PAHs in {{at least one of the}} amended PAH-contaminated soils in 35 days of growth. Banagrass biomass production in all the treatments was far greater than the other four species. No plant control pots were most effective to reduce PAHs in the un-amended PAH soil. Vetiver degraded all PAHs when planted in the PAH soil amended with 1 / 3 of the Promix soil (a 2 / 3 PAH soil volume). Among five biofuel crops tested, banagrass produced a tripled amount or more of biomass than all the other species in the LF- 14 un-amended PAH soil or its amended soils. The dry weight (dw) biomass of banagrass averaged ∼ 3 g/day/ 3 -L pot in all PAH soils and 6 g/day/ 3 -L pot in Promix as harvested at the ground level.

40|$|Master's thesis in Environmental technologyThe {{oil and gas}} {{activities}} in the northern region have showed an increase over the last years. This year a new field, Skrugard, was discovered in the Barents Sea and the two parliaments in Norway and Russia confirmed the official delimitation line in the former “grey zone” area. As a result of this, {{the oil and gas}} {{activities in}} this area are only expected to grow. Chemical dispersants are used in oil spill <b>clean-up</b> <b>processes.</b> It dissolves the oil into smaller particles so it dissolves more easily into the water column. The dispersant makes it easier for the oil to form smaller particles or droplets that are dispersible in the water column. When the oil goes into the water column it is more available to the organisms living there, like fish and mussels. The oil and gas reservoirs in the northern areas like the Barents Sea are located closer to shore than in the southern parts of Norway. If there was an oil spill in this region, the use of chemical dispersant can be necessary in order to prevent it for reaching the shoreline since the oil has a shorter time/distance to be weathered. In this thesis Atlantic salmon and blue mussels were exposed to oil with and without the present of chemical dispersant agent. The dispersant used in this study was of the same type that were used in the Gulf of Mexico after the Deep Water Horizon accident, Corexit 9500. The objective was to study the effect of the dispersant chemical in relation to uptake and effects of oil in fish and mussels. The result from the exposure time showed that it was a statistically significant difference in the uptake of pollutant in Atlantic salmon in the oil-exposed groups with and without chemical dispersant agent compared to the reference group. However it was not detected a statistically significant difference between the oil-exposed group without chemical dispersant compared to the oil-exposed group with chemical dispersant. In general is seems as the oil-exposed group without chemical dispersant had a higher response than the oil-exposed group with chemical dispersant.

Spent oil based drilling mud (drilling fluid) is a waste from the Oil and Gas industry with great potentials for recycling after appropriate <b>clean-up</b> and treatment <b>processes.</b> This research is the novel application of nanoclays extracted from spent oil based drilling mud (drilling fluid) clean-up as nanofiller {{in the manufacture of}} nanocomposite materials. Research and initial experiments have been undertaken which investigate the suitability of Polyamide 6 (PA 6) as potential polymer of interest. SEM and EDAX were used to ascertain morphological and elemental characteristics of the nanofiller. ICPOES has been used to ascertain the metal concentration of the untreated nanofiller to be treated (by oil and heavy metal extraction) before the production of nanocomposite materials. The challenges faced and future works are also discussed. Petroleum Trust Development Fund (PTDF), Nigeria...|$|R
40|$|Management and {{treatment}} of solid waste can mitigate adverse impacts on environment and human health, and also can support economic development and quality of life. A number of thermo-chemical waste treatment methods (i. e. waste-to-energy conversion pathways such as, Pyrolysis, Gasification and Incineration) can transfer solid waste into energy, while gasification technology provides an efficient and environmental friendly solution to produce {{energy in the form}} of syngas. This paper presents an experimental investigation of syngas production using a pilot scale fluidised bed gasification process for energy recovery from solid waste. As feedstock preparation plays an important role to increase performance of gasification, steps offeed stock preparation (sorting, shredding and dying) are explained in detailed. Syngas production and <b>clean-up</b> and burning <b>process</b> is explained. The composition of syngas produced at different stages of the experiment is presented. Heat balance of heat engines, emission control and mass and energy balances of gasification plant used for energy recovery in this study is presented and discussed. This study found that about 65 % of the original energy of solid waste is converted to syngas and 23 % is converted to char with remaining 12 % as residue loss. The primary energy conversion is done by burning syngas in a 0. 5 MWe gas engine through an otto cycle power generation...|$|R
