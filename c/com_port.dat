25|$|Today, most BBS {{software}} {{that is still}} actively supported, such as Worldgroup, Wildcat! BBS and Citadel/UX, is Web-enabled, and the traditional text interface has been replaced (or operates concurrently) with a Web-based user interface. For those more nostalgic for the true BBS experience, one can use NetSerial (Windows) or DOSBox (Windows/*nix) to redirect DOS <b>COM</b> <b>port</b> software to telnet, allowing them to connect to Telnet BBSes using 1980s and 1990s era modem terminal emulation software, like Telix, Terminate, Qmodem and Procomm Plus. Modern 32-bit terminal emulators such as mTelnet and SyncTerm include native telnet support.|$|E

2500|$|... /DEBUGPORT=comx [...] Specifies the <b>COM</b> <b>port</b> {{to use for}} the debug port. By default, /DEBUGPORT uses COM2 if it exists. Otherwise, {{the default}} is COM1. Use of this switch {{automatically}} enables the /DEBUG switch.|$|E
50|$|Most PC-compatible {{computers}} in the 1980s and 1990s had one or two <b>COM</b> <b>ports.</b> As of 2007, most computers ship with one or no physical <b>COM</b> <b>ports.</b> As of 2014, most PC-compatible computers don't include any <b>COM</b> <b>ports.</b> A {{lot of them do}} still include a COM header.|$|R

2500|$|... /NOSERIALMICE [...] (Obsolete on all {{versions}} post-Windows NT 4.0) Replaced by {{the absence}} of the /FASTDETECT switch. Disables serial mouse detection on the specified COM ports. Using /NOSERIALMICE without specifying a <b>COM</b> <b>port</b> disables serial mouse detection on all COM ports.|$|E
2500|$|... /CRASHDEBUG [...] Loads the kernel {{debugger}} at OS startup, but {{it remains}} inactive until a Stop error occurs. With this switch, the <b>COM</b> <b>port</b> {{can be used for}} normal operations while Windows is running. If Windows crashes, the switch converts the port to a debug port. (This action turns on remote debugging.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite the {{bandwidth}} limitations, transparent TCP/IP is supported. [...] Iridium claims {{data rates}} up to 10 {{kilobits per second}} for their [...] "direct Internet" [...] service which utilizes v.42bis compression over a PPP dialup connection to Iridium's Arizona gateway. [...] Actual data rates remain at 2300 to 2400 bit/s for any compressed data such as a JPG image or ZIP file, but plain text or HTML may transfer [...] "up to" [...] 10 kbit/s. [...] Iridium 9500, 9505 and 9505A phones can be connected to computers using an RS-232 connection, as can the 9522A transceiver module. [...] The 9555 and Extreme phones connect to computers with a standard USB cable, using an internal USB to serial bridge chip and Windows drivers to emulate a serial <b>COM</b> <b>port</b> for compatibility with standard PPP clients.|$|E
50|$|LAN Server pioneered certain file/print sharing {{concepts}} such as domains (and domain controllers), networked <b>COM</b> <b>ports,</b> domain aliases, and automatic printer driver selection and installation.|$|R
50|$|A {{redirector}} will typically permit {{creation of}} many (at least 256) virtual <b>COM</b> <b>ports,</b> but simultaneous use {{of hundreds of}} ports is often practically limited {{by a number of}} factors, including the memory and processor requirements of the redirector, limits on operating system resources, and the performance of the network stack.|$|R
50|$|Multiple turtles are {{supported}} by MSWLogo, as well as 3D graphics. Input from <b>COM</b> <b>ports</b> and LPT ports are also allowed by MSWLogo through windows GUI. Interrupts can be triggered via keyboard and mouse events. Simple GIF animations may also be produced on MSWLogo version 6.5 with the gifsave command.|$|R
5000|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{redirector}} {{is to make the}} virtual <b>COM</b> <b>port</b> exhibit behavior that closely resembles that of a [...] "real" [...] <b>COM</b> <b>port,</b> i.e., a <b>COM</b> <b>port</b> driver for local serial port hardware. A virtual <b>COM</b> <b>port</b> itself is a relatively simple software mechanism that can be implemented by driver software similar to that of a conventional <b>COM</b> <b>port</b> driver. The main challenges arise in two other areas: the network connection to the device server and the behavior of the device server. These issues are described in the Technology section below.|$|E
50|$|Historically most {{personal}} computers had a built-in D-sub serial RS232 port, {{also referred to}} as a <b>COM</b> <b>port,</b> which could be used for connecting the computer to most types of serial RS232 devices. By the late 90â€™s many computer manufacturers started to phase out the serial <b>COM</b> <b>port</b> in favor of the USB port. By the mid 2000s some computers had both a serial <b>COM</b> <b>port</b> and a USB port, however many did no longer have a serial <b>COM</b> <b>port</b> by that time; and today most modern computers have no serial <b>COM</b> <b>port</b> but instead only USB ports instead.|$|E
50|$|Applications use a <b>COM</b> <b>port</b> {{redirector}} {{through one}} or more virtual COM ports that the redirector creates, as configured by the user. When the application opens the virtual <b>COM</b> <b>port,</b> the redirector makes an IP network connection to the device server at the specified IP address and TCP/UDP port number that corresponds to the remote device on the server. The <b>COM</b> <b>port</b> redirector then begins relaying the application data stream between the virtual <b>COM</b> <b>port</b> and the device server.|$|E
5000|$|In 1991 {{the company}} {{released}} a dual port serial card that allowed users to set its I/O addresses to any two <b>COM</b> <b>ports.</b> [...] In 1994, Sealevel developed the RS-485 auto-enabled circuit. The circuit eliminated {{the need to}} control the RS-485 transceiver-enable signal via software and removed the risk of communications error due to bus communications.|$|R
50|$|FMSLogo {{supports}} multiple turtles, and 3D Graphics. FMSLogo allows {{input from}} <b>COM</b> <b>ports</b> and LPT ports. FMSLogo also supports a windows interface thus I/O {{is available through}} this GUI- and keyboard and mouse events can trigger interrupts. Simple GIF animations may also be produced with the GIFSAVE command. Jim Muller wrote The Great Logo Adventure, a complete Logo manual using MSWLogo as the demonstration language.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>COM</b> <b>ports</b> are {{interfaced}} by {{an integrated}} circuit such as 16550 UART. This IC has seven internal 8-bit registers which hold information and configuration data about which data {{is to be}} sent or was received, the baud rate, interrupt configuration and more. In the case of COM1, these registers can be accessed by writing to or reading from the I/O addresses 0x3F8 to 0x3FF.|$|R
5000|$|As a {{simplified}} example a typical standard USB to serial adapter {{consists of a}} USB processor chip which processes the USB signals. The USB processor sends the processed USB signals to a serial driver chip which applies the correct voltages and sends the processed data signals to the serial output. [...] For the computer {{to be able to}} detect and process the data signals drivers must be installed on the computer. When the USB to serial adapter is connected to the computer via the USB port the drivers on the computer creates a virtual <b>COM</b> <b>port</b> which shows up in Device Manager. This virtual <b>COM</b> <b>port</b> can be accessed and used {{as if it was a}} built-in serial <b>COM</b> <b>port.</b> However, the characteristics of the virtual <b>COM</b> <b>port</b> are not exactly the same as a real internal <b>COM</b> <b>port,</b> mainly due to data latency; which means that if very sensitive and precise data transfer is required, the USB to serial adapter might be unreliable and not a desired solution. [...] Virtual COM drivers are usually available for Windows, Linux and MAC only.|$|E
5000|$|Connect serial-based {{applications}} with a COM/TTY port driver: Many {{software applications}} {{have been written}} to communicate with devices that are directly connected to a server's serial COM ports (robotic assembly machines, scanners, card readers, sensors, blood analyzers, etc.). Companies may want to network these applications because the devices that were directly connected to the server's COM ports need to be moved to a location some distance away from the application server. Since the original application was designed to talk directly to a specific <b>COM</b> <b>port,</b> a solution seamless to both the application and device must be implemented to enable communication across an IP network. (i.e., a solution that makes the application think it is talking directly to a <b>COM</b> <b>port.)</b> In this application, serial ports can be connected to network servers or workstations running <b>COM</b> <b>port</b> redirector software operating as a virtual <b>COM</b> <b>port.</b> Many terminal server vendors include <b>COM</b> <b>port</b> redirector software with their terminal servers. This application need is most common in Windows environments, but also exists in Linux and Unix environments.|$|E
50|$|Because <b>COM</b> <b>port</b> redirectors emulate COM ports on the {{operating}} system abstraction level, rather than hardware serial ports, old software which is not written to utilize {{the operating}} system, but instead interface directly with a serial microcontroller (hardware ports 0x3F8 to 0x3FF for COM1, for example) will not function with <b>COM</b> <b>port</b> redirectors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{outlines}} {{a design}} philosophy adopted for hardware enhancements to a mobile robotic system. These enhancements allow implementation and real world evaluation {{of current and}} future research into autonomous robotic control. The design philosophy is followed to minimise the need for modification and redesign of the hardware for future research applications. The key aspect of this design philosophy is to separate the custom electronic hardware from the control computer. This primarily allows little or no hardware modifications when the control computer is upgraded for future applications. All electronics hardware is controlled by a distributed network of microcontrollers which interface with the control computer via virtual <b>COM</b> <b>ports</b> over USB technology...|$|R
