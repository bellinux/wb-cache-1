5|$|Polyadenylate polymerases {{are not as}} ancient. They have {{separately}} {{evolved in}} both bacteria and eukaryotes from CCA-adding enzyme, which is the enzyme that <b>completes</b> <b>the</b> 3' ends of tRNAs. Its catalytic domain is homologous {{to that of other}} polymerases. It is presumed that the horizontal transfer of bacterial CCA-adding enzyme to eukaryotes allowed the archaeal-like CCA-adding enzyme to switch function to a poly(A) polymerase. Some lineages, like archaea and cyanobacteria, never evolved a polyadenylate polymerase.|$|E

5|$|Jaws allow fish {{to eat a}} {{wide variety}} of food, {{including}} plants and other organisms. Fish ingest food through the mouth and break it down in the esophagus. In the stomach, food is further digested and, in many fish, processed in finger-shaped pouches called pyloric caeca, which secrete digestive enzymes and absorb nutrients. Organs such as the liver and pancreas add enzymes and various chemicals as the food moves through the digestive tract. The intestine <b>completes</b> <b>the</b> process of digestion and nutrient absorption.|$|E

5|$|Puccini {{had long}} {{considered}} writing {{a set of}} one-act operas which would be performed together in a single evening, but faced {{with a lack of}} suitable subjects and opposition from his publisher, he repeatedly put the project aside. However, by 1916 Puccini had completed the one-act tragedy Il tabarro and, after considering various ideas, he began work the following year on the solemn, religious, all-female opera Suor Angelica. Gianni Schicchi, a comedy, <b>completes</b> <b>the</b> triptych with a further contrast of mood. The score combines elements of Puccini's modern style of harmonic dissonance with lyrical passages reminiscent of Rossini, and it has been praised for its inventiveness and imagination.|$|E
