40|$|AbstractLower limb malformations are {{generally}} isolated or sporadic events. However, {{they are sometimes}} associated with other anomalies of the bones and/or viscera in patients with constitutional syndromes or disorders of the skeleton. This paper reviews the main imaging features of these abnormalities, which generally exhibit a broad spectrum. This paper focuses on several different bone malformations: proximal focal femoral deficiency, <b>congenital</b> <b>short</b> <b>femur</b> and femoral duplication for the femur, tibial hemimelia (aplasia/hypoplasia of the tibia) and congenital bowing for the tibia, fibular hemimelia (aplasia/hypoplasia) for the fibula, and aplasia, hypoplasia and congenital dislocation for the patella...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{analyze the}} {{outcomes}} of fetuses referred because of <b>short</b> <b>femur</b> length. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of all singleton pregnancies referred to a tertiary care referral hospital with a femur length below the 5 (th) percentile. All ultrasound scan reports, including Doppler, fetal karyotyping, pregnancy outcome and neonatal data were analyzed. RESULTS: In 112 patients, 87 (78 %) had an isolated <b>short</b> <b>femur</b> and 25 (22 %) had a non-isolated <b>short</b> <b>femur.</b> The non-isolated cases consisted of chromosomal disorders (n = 6), skeletal abnormalities (n = 6), multiple abnormalities (n = 12) and 1 genetic disorder.

40|$|Based on the {{findings}} in 12 patients with skeletal dysplasia diagnosed antenatally, the authors propose a tailored approach to the evaluation of foetuses with shortened long bones, depending {{on the time of}} discovery, the degree of shortening and the associated findings. During the second trimester, a very <b>short</b> <b>femur</b> [2 standard deviations (SD) - 5 mm and less] most probably corresponds to a bone dysplasia, although the differential diagnosis is mainly early intra-uterine growth retardation, and the foetal skeleton should be surveyed completely in order to find supplementary features suggestive of dwarfism. Anomalies of long bones in their shape, thickness or contour, or spinal ossification disorders or undermineralisation (best evaluated at the level of calvarial bones) are most helpful in determining the type of dysplasia. A <b>short</b> <b>femur</b> (between 2 SD and 2 SD - 4 mm) may indicate growth retardation, a chromosomal anomaly or dwarfism. Followup examinations are mandatory in order to differentiate between them. During the third trimester a very <b>short</b> <b>femur</b> may indicate a bone dysplasia and the work-up should be the same as in the second trimester. A <b>short</b> <b>femur</b> may correspond to dwarfism of late development, a growth-retarded foetus or constitutional shortness. Various ratios, especially that of the femur/foot, are helpful in differentiating between them. In case of previous family history, a short or very <b>short</b> <b>femur</b> usually indicates recurrence of the dwarfism. In all cases of antenatal diagnosis, confirmation of the sonographic findings should be obtained either by foetal or neonatal radiographs. The approach proposed by the authors should provide sufficient information to counsel the family not only for the ongoing pregnancy but also for subsequent ones.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{results of}} twenty Van Nes rota-tional osteotomies for {{unilateral}} proximal femoral focal deficiency and <b>congenital</b> <b>short</b> <b>femur</b> were analyzed after follow-ups {{of two to}} eight years. Assessed {{on the basis of}} prosthetic function, the results were good in ten, fair in six, and poor in four. Twelve patients re-quired a rerotation procedure, six of them twice, be-cause of postoperative derotation. Appropriate leg-length discrepancy to place the ankle, converted to the knee, at the right level, as well as normal ankle and foot motion and muscle power, are prerequisites to the procedure, which should be deferred until the child is about twelve years old to avoid prolonged hospitaliza-tion for rerotation and gait training. Proximal femoral focal deficiency (Fig. I) and con-genital short femur are uncommon but complex problems. Recently they were discussed in detail at a symposium sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences 1 - 4 In the past, treatment of proximal femoral focal deficiency has often tended to be empirical and based on the experience of the individual physician, and all too fre-quently no specific treatment has been attempted. There is no single approach to treatment that applies in all cases. Each case must be assessed individually, since function may be the problem in one patient while appearance is the primary concern in another. This paper reports the results of the Van Nes tibial rotational osteotomy as it was used in Toronto in selected unilateral cases of proximal femoral focal deficiency and <b>congenital</b> <b>short</b> <b>femur.</b> In 1950, Van Nes described a procedure in which os-teotomy of the tibia with rotation of the distal fragmen...|$|E

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Through a retrospective and analytical study of cases and controls where evaluated 152 pregnant women that were distributed in two groups. The cases grouped in 76 pregnant women with severe preeclampsia and controls in 76 pregnant women with preeclampsia without severe preeclampsia. RESULTS: The proportion of pregnancies with severe preeclampsia and with <b>short</b> <b>femur</b> length was 35. 5 % (27 pregnancies), while, the proportion of pregnancies with severe preeclampsia without <b>short</b> <b>femur</b> length was 64. 5 % (49 pregnancies).

40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE: This study {{aimed to}} {{demonstrate}} that the lengthening technique of an external fixator associated with locked intramedullary nail is an efficient method that decreases the duration of the external fixation and improves the rehabilitation period. METHODS: From January of 2005 to May of 2014, 31 patients with mean lower limb discrepancy of 5. 31 cm were treated. The etiologies of the deformity were femur fracture sequelae, infection, hip development dysplasia, polio, and <b>congenital</b> <b>short</b> <b>femur.</b> RESULTS: The mean duration of external fixation was 2. 47 months (external fixation index of 16. 15 days per cm). The mean time for bone healing was 6. 66 months (consolidation index 43 days per cm). Initial mean knee range of motion was - 1 ° to 100 °, progressing to 0 °- 115 ° at the end of treatment. The complications observed were incomplete osteotomies, hip subluxation, broken fixator, decreased knee range of motion, and need for locking screw removal. CONCLUSION: Femur lengthening with a monoplanar external fixator associated with locked intramedullary nail allowed for a shorter period of external fixation use, better protection for the regenerated bone tissue, and early rehabilitation with possible complications...|$|E
30|$|A {{total of}} 40 {{suitable}} cases were identified consisting of 23 males and 17 females {{with a mean}} age of 13.3 and 11.8  years, respectively. Moseley charts were used for the 14 cases undergoing the Metaizeau technique, giving an average estimated LLD at maturity of 4.5  cm. In the Canale technique group, 13 cases Paley’s multiplier was used to give a mean estimated LLD of 4.8. The right was found to be involved in 24 cases and the remaining 16 in the left; 20 cases involved the distal femur, 8 involved the proximal tibia and 12 cases involved both tibia and femur. The distribution of operative site was equally comparable between each group. Follow-up was from 12 to 72  months with a mean of 2.2  years. Causes of leg-length discrepancy were found to be diverse with 16 cases from congenital causes including developmental dysplasia of the hip, <b>congenital</b> <b>short</b> <b>femur</b> and proximal focal femoral deficiency. Seven cases were as a result of Perthes disease, 5 were identified as post-traumatic and 3 from previous slipped capital femoral epiphysis. The remaining 9 cases were from other causes.|$|E
30|$|The {{formulae}} {{used in our}} spreadsheet {{were derived}} from the multiplier method developed by Paley et al. [1, 9]. The use of the multiplier method for congenital discrepancy assumes a Shapiro type 1 growth pattern where the ratio {{of growth in the}} short limb to that of the long limb does not change over time [10]. The congenital LLD table is used for <b>congenital</b> <b>short</b> <b>femur,</b> fibular hemimelia, hemihypertrophy, hemiatrophy, and posteriomedial bowing of the tibia [1]. The developmental LLD table is used for Ollier disease, poliomyelitis, growth arrest, or for post-traumatic discrepancies [1]. These formulae contained minor differences when compared to the Sanders spreadsheet. The growth constants for each physis in the Multiplier app and PG app are 0.71 for the distal femoral physis, 0.57 for the proximal tibial physis, and 0.67 for both the proximal tibial and distal femoral physis together. The Sanders worksheet uses 0.71 for the distal femoral physis, 0.54 for the proximal tibial physis, and uses both the individual distal femoral and proximal tibial constants when calculating timing of epiphysiodesis at both physes. We used the same growth constants as the Multiplier and PG app as published in ‘Principles of Deformity Correction’ in reference to Anderson et al. [9, 11].|$|E

By changing from a distal to a proximal osteotomy for lengthening, the mean range of knee movement was significantly increased from 98. 1 ° to 124. 2 ° (p = 0. 041) and there was a trend towards a reduced requirement for quadricepsplasty, although this was not statistically significant (p = 0. 07).

40|$|Purpose: Autosomal {{recessive}} <b>congenital</b> <b>short</b> bowel {{syndrome is}} caused by mutations in CLMP. No mutations {{were found in the}} affected males of a family with presumed X-linked <b>congenital</b> <b>short</b> bowel syndrome or in an isolated male patient. Our aim was to identify the disease-causing mutation in these patients. Methods: We performed mutation analysis of the second exon of FLNA in the two surviving affected males of the presumed X-linked family and in the isolated patient. Results: We identified a novel 2 -base-pair deletion in the second exon of FLNA in all these male patients. The deletion is located between two nearby methionines at the N-terminus of filamin A. Previous studies showed that translation of FLNA occurs from both methionines, resulting in two isoforms of the protein. We hypothesized that the longer isoform is no longer translated due to the mutation and that this mutation is therefore not lethal for males in utero.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{characterize}} the in vivo role epiphycan (Epn) has in cartilage development and/or maintenance. MethodsEpn-deficient mice were generated by disrupting the Epn gene in mouse embryonic stem cells. Epn/biglycan (Bgn) double-deficient mice were produced by crossing Epn-deficient mice with Bgn-deficient mice. Whole knee joint histological sections were stained using van Gieson or Fast green/Safranin-O to analyze collagen or proteoglycan content, respectively. Microarray {{analysis was performed}} to detect gene expression changes within knee joints. ResultsEpn-deficient and Epn/Bgn double-deficient mice appeared normal at birth. No significant difference in body weight or femur length was detected in any animal at 1 month of age. However, 9 -month Epn/Bgn double-deficient mice were significantly lighter and had <b>shorter</b> <b>femurs</b> than wild type mice, regardless of gender. Male Epn-deficient mice also had significantly <b>shorter</b> <b>femurs</b> than wild type mice at 9  months. Most of the deficient animals developed osteoarthritis (OA) with age; the onset of OA was observed earliest in Epn/Bgn double-deficient mice. Message RNA isolated from Epn/Bgn double-deficient knee joints displayed increased matrix protein expression compared with wild type mice, including other small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) members such as asporin, fibromodulin and lumican. ConclusionSimilar to other previously studied SLRPs, EPN {{plays an important role}} in maintaining joint integrity.
