500|$|The Canadian {{government}} declined Mitsui's {{offer of}} military service. [...] A series of Orders in Council in 1942 deprived Canadians of Japanese descent {{of their property}} and rights, culminating in Japanese-Canadian internment {{for the duration of}} the war. [...] The government confiscated the Mitsui family's 17-acre property and poultry facilities in Coquitlam and sold it off, compensating the family with an estimated one-third of its total value. [...] The RCMP took Mitsui and his daughter Lucy to Hastings Park for registration as an enemy alien. [...] Mitsui wore his military medals and when the registering official asked him, [...] "What <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> Sarge?", Mitsui responded, [...] "What are you doing to me? I served my country. [...] You've taken everything away from me.... What are the good of my medals?" [...] He scattered his medals on the floor and table, and refused to wear them thereafter when they were returned to him. [...] He and his family were detained in a facility in Greenwood, British Columbia. [...] Mitsui later stated, [...] "I had complete confidence in the government that they wouldn't be doing anything to me because of being a veteran." [...] All the family could later retrieve was a samurai sword Mitsui's son George had buried.|$|E
