The gunmen were able to injure four people at the scene while {{a family of four}} in a nearby apartment received sharpnel wounds. A seven year old girl were among those injured.

50|$|Let us {{consider}} a simple example {{of buying a}} <b>car.</b> Suppose {{that there are two}} <b>cars</b> available to the decision maker: <b>Car</b> A and <b>Car</b> B. <b>Car</b> A is much cheaper than <b>Car</b> B but its overall quality is much less when compared to that for <b>Car</b> B. On the other hand, <b>Car</b> B is more expensive than <b>Car</b> A but it is also of better quality. A decision maker who is concerned of the high price issue, may choose <b>Car</b> A over the better quality and more expensive <b>Car</b> B. Next suppose that the <b>car</b> dealer presents to the decision maker a third <b>car,</b> say <b>Car</b> C, which is way more expensive than <b>Car</b> B but now the overall quality of <b>Car</b> C is marginally higher than that of <b>Car</b> B.

In the particular chapters of the theoretical part are described different contexts of the topic (history of anethesia, change implementation theory, description of a current situation in anestesiology, comparison with other countries, legislative) and their mutual connection. Research results dealing with anesthesiological nurses opinions on suggested model of changes in <b>carring</b> out an anesthesia are described in an Empirical section.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a proposal {{how to avoid}} today’s problems in car electronics, mainly controllers, with respect to scalability, usability and effectiveness. Contemporary car controllers lack of common standards in data exchange {{as a consequence of}} incompatible field buses and protocols, while intra-car communication is increasing at the same time. A dedicated, fully-fletched, real-time computer network is presented that is capable to replace all types of field buses in cars. <b>CarRing</b> II exhibits functions from 7 ISO layers, instead of layer 1 and 2 functionality field buses such as FlexRay or CAN. <b>CarRing</b> II aims at general intra-car-communications from a system’s perspective and can be used to connect arbitrary sensors, actuators and controllers to a distributed mechatronic system. It optimally supports future x-by-wire driver-assistance systems. Its main goals in comparison to field buses are better usability and effectiveness as well as better reliability and real-time capability. 1...|$|E
