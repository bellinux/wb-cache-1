40|$|Conclusion: Reduced-RADPLAT for HPC {{achieved}} comparative {{survival and}} locoregional control rates with lower toxicities compared with <b>concurrent</b> <b>chemoradiotherapies</b> including original RADPLAT. S- 1 adjuvant chemotherapy showed a survival benefit. Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicities of targeted intra-arterial (IA) infusion of cisplatin with concurrent radiotherapy with a reduced dose (reduced-RADPLAT) for resectable hypopharyngeal cancer (HPC). Methods: Between 1999 – 2012, 50 patients with stage II–IVA HPC primarily treated by reduced-RADPLAT were analyzed. They were treated by 2 – 5 courses of IA cisplatin infusion (100 [*]mg per body) with simultaneous systemic infusion of sodium thiosulfate concurrent with conventional radiotherapy (66 – 70 [*]Gy). After 2003, S- 1, an oral fluoropyrimidine, adjuvant chemotherapy {{was administered to}} all eligible patients. Results: During a median follow-up of 48. 6 months, the estimated 3 - and 5 -year overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional control, and laryngoesophageal dysfunction-free survival (LEDFS) rates were 76. 0 % and 62. 0 %, 58. 0 % and 50. 0 %, 66. 0 % and 62. 0 %, and 56. 0 % and 54. 0 %, respectively. Grade 3 toxicities were observed in 30. 0 %. No patient had grade 4 or higher toxicities. No patient required tube feeding or tracheotomy at 3 months after treatment. T 4 -lesions and S- 1 administration were significant factors predicting poor and good OS, PFS, and LEDFS, respectively. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis GroupEmbargo Period 12 month...|$|R

40|$|Locally {{advanced}} {{breast cancer}} (LABC) represents 15 % of all non-metastatic breast cancers, {{with an overall}} poor prognosis, despite current guidelines that recommend neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery and adjuvant radiation. Therefore, a novel treatment paradigm using <b>concurrent</b> neoadjuvant <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> was proposed. A clinical trial was designed, where 32 LABC patients were treated with q 3 weekly 5 -fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide for three cycles, followed by weekly docetaxel for 9 weeks with concurrent regional radiation (45 + 5. 4 Gy) for the first 6 weeks. Patients subsequently underwent modified radical mastectomies. Pathological complete responses (pCR) and 3 year overall survival rates were compared to a matched concurrent control cohort. The concurrent chemoradiation cohort saw {{a significant increase in}} pCR rate and a trend toward 15 % improvement in overall survival that failed to reach statistical significance. This regimen was not without toxicity, and 25 % of patients experienced grade 3 or greater dermatitis and 25 % experienced grade 3 or greater pneumonitis, resulting in one death. Tumour biomarker, plasma osteopontin, prior to chemotherapy was found to significantly predict for overall survival.

40|$|Purpose: To compare {{patterns}} of failure, late toxicities, and survival in locally advanced cervical cancer patients treated by either low-dose-rate (LDR) or conformal high-dose-rate (HDRc) brachytherapy {{as a part}} of curative radiotherapy. Materials and Methods: A retrospective comparative study of 217 advanced cervix cancer patients was conducted; 90 of these patients received LDR and 127 received HDRc brachytherapy. All patients were staged using International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) rules, had pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and were treated with <b>concurrent</b> cisplatin <b>chemoradiotherapy.</b> Both groups matched for FIGO stage, MRI tumor volume, and uterine invasion status. Results: Local and pelvic failures were similar 12 – 13 % and 14 % both in both groups.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Concurrent</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> {{has become}} the {{standard}} of care for advanced head and neck cancers in organ preservation strategies. However, the optimal regimen for <b>concurrent</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> to maximise treatment response and minimise toxicity has not been determined. The {{purpose of the present}} clinical study was to review our experience with <b>concurrent</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> by using the capecitabine and cisplatin (XP) regimen with the aim of organ preservation in patients with locoregionally advanced laryngo-hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LHSCC). Thirty-one patients with stage III/IV resectable LHSCC treated with <b>concurrent</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> using the XP regimen were enrolled in the present study. The patients fulfilled the criteria for total laryngectomy when surgery was selected. The primary endpoint of this study was disease-free survival with a functional larynx, which was indicated by the following conditions: survival, disease-free status at all sites and retention of a functional larynx. Following <b>concurrent</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy,</b> 23 patients (74. 2 %) exhibited complete response (CR) at the primary site and 18 (69. 2 %) exhibited CR at the lymph nodes. CR at the primary site and lymph nodes was identified in 19 patients (61. 3 %). The Kaplan-Meier 2 - and 3 -year cumulative disease-free survival rates were 71. 5 and 59. 6 %, respectively. Anatomical laryngeal preserva-tion was feasible in 27 patients (87. 1 %) during the 36 -month follow-up period. Permanent gastrostomy was required in 1 disease-free patient with an intact larynx.

30|$|In {{our current}} study, most {{patients}} received CCRT {{based on their}} clinical staging. The 5 -year distant metastasis rate in early stage disease was low, which did not associate with IMRT alone or CCRT. To date, {{there is still no}} consensus that whether stage IIb patients require chemotherapy. A previous study reported that IMRT combined with CCT did not show any benefit in patients with stage IIb NPC (Tham et al. 2010). As recommended by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) clinical practice guidelines of head and neck cancers, <b>concurrent</b> cisplatin-based <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> is the standard treatment for locally advanced NPC. Our current study showed that CCRT treatment of patients with stage III and stage IVA–B diseases had 17.5 and 24.2  % of the 5 -year distant metastasis rate, respectively. For locally advanced patients, treatment outcome was not satisfactory even with aggressive treatment regimes (Li et al. 2015). CCRT alone or CCRT in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in locally advanced NPC patients showed no difference in overall survival and distant metastasis-free survival, only NACT + CCRT improved the distant metastasis-free survival compared to RT alone (Sun et al. 2013). Theoretically, NACT could improve survival by reducing tumor burden and targeting micrometastasis. However, additional studies Wu et al. (2014), Qiu et al. (2016) have not supported these findings. One possible reason for the conflicting results in these studies may be differences in patient inclusion criteria. Thus, identifying high-risk metastatic NPC patients and applying novel chemotherapeutic regimens including molecular targeting agents to treat such patients should be the focus of future studies.|$|R
40|$|AbstractRadiation {{pneumonitis}} is {{an important}} cause of morbidity after <b>concurrent</b> thoracic <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> (CCRT). However, asymptomatic changes in lung density on computed tomography (CT) -scans occur more commonly, and correspond to regions of inflammatory changes. Characterization of dose- and time-related changes in radiological lung density (RLD) may facilitate improved radiation planning, and allow for a more objective measure for assessing damage. We studied changes in RLD following CCRT with cisplatin–etoposide, using deformable registration to co-register follow-up scans. All CT-scans performed for up to 24 months post-treatment were evaluated in 25 patients treated with CCRT for stage III non-small-cell lung cancer. A total of 104 scans (median of 3 per patient) were co-registered with planning scans using a deformable registration tool (VelocityAI, Atlanta, USA). Last follow-up scan was at median 9. 4 months (range 3. 4 – 22. 6 months). Seven patients developed clinical radiation pneumonitis. RLD changes (in Hounsfield units) were measured in regions receiving 3 – 66 Gy. Linear mixed models were used to study dose–density changes over time. No significant changes in RLD were observed in the first 3 months post-treatment. Increases in RLD were observed at 3 – 6 months (p 30 Gy, with only minor density changes at lower dose levels. Planning target volume size {{was significantly associated with}} RLD changes (p= 0. 03). Limiting lung doses to ≤ 30 Gy during CCRT may limit sub-clinical damage, and the time-course of RLD changes may allow for early quantification of pulmonary damage when evaluating novel treatment strategies...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundThe {{objective}} of this phase I trial was to determine dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) and the maximally tolerated dose of the radiosensitizer Nelfinavir in combination with <b>concurrent</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> in locally advanced {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC). MethodsNelfinavir (dose level 1 : 625 mg orally [PO] twice a day; dose level 2 : 1250 mg PO twice a day) was administered for 7 to 14 days before and concurrently with <b>concurrent</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> to patients with biopsy confirmed IIIA or IIIB unresectable NSCLC. Five patients were treated at dose level 1; eight patients were treated at dose level 2. Patients were treated with <b>concurrent</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> to a dose of 66. 6 Gy. DLTs were defined as any treatment-related grade 4 hematologic toxicity requiring a break in therapy or nonhematologic grade 3 or higher toxicity except esophagitis and pneumonitis. ResultsSixteen patients were enrolled and 13 patients received at least one dose of nelfinavir. Twelve patients were treated with nelfinavir and <b>concurrent</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy.</b> No DLTs have been observed at either dose level. The maximum tolerated dose of nelfinavir was therefore 1250 mg PO twice a day. Six patients experienced grade 4 leukopenia. One patient experienced grade 4 thromobcytopenia. Median follow-up for all 12 response-evaluable patients was 31. 6 months and for survivors is 23. 5 months.

40|$|PURPOSE: Standard {{therapy for}} {{unresectable}} stage III non-small-cell lung cancer includes concomitant chemoradiotherapy. In Cancer and Leukemia Group B 39801, we evaluated whether induction chemotherapy before <b>concurrent</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> {{would result in}} improved survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between July 1998 and May 2002, 366 patients {{were randomly assigned to}} arm A, which involved immediate <b>concurrent</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> with carboplatin area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of 2 and paclitaxel 50 mg/m 2 given weekly during 66 Gy of chest radiotherapy, or arm B, which involved two cycles of carboplatin AUC 6 and paclitaxel 200 mg/m 2 administered every 21 days followed by identical chemoradiotherapy. The accrual goal was 360 patients. RESULTS: Thirty-four percent of patients were female, 66 % were male, and the median age was 63 years. Grade 3 or 4 toxicities during induction chemotherapy on arm B consisted mainly of neutropenia (18 % and 20 %, respectively). During <b>concurrent</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy,</b> {{there was no difference in}} severity of in-field toxicities of esophagitis (grade 3 and 4 were, respectively, 30 % and 2 % for arm A v 28 % and 8 % for arm B) and dyspnea (grade 3 and 4 were, respectively, 11 % and 3 % for arm A v 15 % and 4 % for arm B). Survival differences were not statistically significant (P =. 3), with a median survival on arm A of 12 months (95 % CI, 10 to 16 months) versus 14 months (95 % CI, 11 to 16 months) on arm B and a 2 -year survival of 29 % (95 % CI, 22 % to 35 %) and 31 % (95 % CI, 25 % to 38 %).

Our goals were to compare the therapeutic effects of <b>concurrent</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> and radiotherapy alone in local advanced esophageal cancer using meta-analysis. MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane library were searched for studies comparing chemoradiotherapy with radiotherapy alone for advanced esophageal cancer. Only randomized controlled trials were included, and extracted data were analyzed with Review Manager Version 5. 2. The pooled relative risks (RR) and their 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for statistical analysis. Nine studies were included. Of 1, 135 cases, 612 received <b>concurrent</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> and 523 were treated with radiotherapy alone. The overall response rate (complete remission and partial remission) was 93. 4 % for <b>concurrent</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> and 83. 7 % for radiotherapy alone (P = 0. 05). The RR values of 1 -year, 3 -year, and 5 -year survival rates were 1. 14 (95 % CI: 1. 04 - 1. 24, P = 0. 006), 1. 66 (95 % CI: 1. 34 - 2. 06, P < 0. 001), and 2. 43 (95 % CI: 1. 63 - 3. 63, P < 0. 001), respectively. The RR value of the merged occurrence rate of acute toxic effects was 2. 34 (95 % CI: 1. 90 - 2. 90, P < 0. 001). There {{was no difference in}} the incidence of late toxic effects, which had an RR value of 1. 21 (95 % CI: 0. 96 - 1. 54, P = 0. 11). The RR level of persistence and recurrence was 0. 71 (95 % CI: 0. 62 - 0. 81, P < 0. 001), and for the distant metastasis rate, the RR value was 0. 79 (95 % CI: 0. 61 - 1. 02, P = 0. 07). <b>Concurrent</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> significantly improved overall survival rate, reduced the risk of persistence and recurrence, but had little effect on the primary tumor response, and increased the occurrence of acute toxic effects...|$|E
40|$|Radiation {{pneumonitis}} is {{an important}} cause of morbidity after <b>concurrent</b> thoracic <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> (CCRT). However, asymptomatic changes in lung density on computed tomography (CT) -scans occur more commonly, and correspond to regions of inflammatory changes. Characterization of dose- and time-related changes in radiological lung density (RLD) may facilitate improved radiation planning, and allow for a more objective measure for assessing damage. We studied changes in RLD following CCRT with cisplatin–etoposide, using deformable registration to co-register follow-up scans. All CT-scans performed for up to 24 months post-treatment were evaluated in 25 patients treated with CCRT for stage III non-small-cell lung cancer. A total of 104 scans (median of 3 per patient) were co-registered with planning scans using a deformable registration tool (VelocityAI, Atlanta, USA). Last follow-up scan was at median 9. 4 months (range 3. 4 – 22. 6 months). Seven patients developed clinical radiation pneumonitis. RLD changes (in Hounsfield units) were measured in regions receiving 3 – 66 Gy. Linear mixed models were used to study dose–density changes over time. No significant changes in RLD were observed in the first 3 months post-treatment. Increases in RLD were observed at 3 – 6 months (p 30 Gy, with only minor density changes at lower dose levels. Planning target volume size {{was significantly associated with}} RLD changes (p = 0. 03). Limiting lung doses to ≤ 30 Gy during CCRT may limit sub-clinical damage, and the time-course of RLD changes may allow for early quantification of pulmonary damage when evaluating novel treatment strategies.

40|$|Background: Only 20 % of {{patients}} with stage III NSCLC are cured by surgery. There is a disagreement among the oncologists {{in terms of whether}} which regimen (induction chemotherapy followed <b>chemoradiotherapy,</b> <b>concurrent</b> chemoradiation or concurrent chemoradiation followed consolidation chemotherapy) is best choice in inoperable LA NSCLC. Objective: To evaluate chemotherapy timing in inoperable LA NSCLC (before, only concomitant or after curative chemotherapy). Materials and methods: Total of 74 consecutive patient with LA NSCLC which was inoperable due to medical condition or stage from Kayseri Research and Training Hospital were analyzed retrospectively. The patients were divided into three groups according to treatment protocols: Induction chemotherapy followed chemoradiotherapy (Ind.

40|$|BackgroundConcurrent <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> (<b>concurrent</b> CRT) {{to treat}} {{head and neck}} cancer is {{associated}} with significant reductions of weight, mobility, {{and quality of life}} (QOL). An intervention focusing on functional exercise may attenuate these losses. MethodsWe allocated patients to a 14 ‐week functional resistance and walking program designed to maintain physical activity during cancer treatment (MPACT group; n = 11), or to usual care (control group; n = 9). Outcomes were assessed at baseline, and 7 and 14 weeks. ResultsCompared to controls, the MPACT participants had attenuated decline or improvement in several strength, mobility, physical activity, diet, and QOL endpoints. These trends were statistically significant (p <. 05) in knee strength, mental health, head and neck QOL, and barriers to exercise. ConclusionIn this pilot study of patients with head and neck cancer undergoing concurrent CRT, MPACT training was feasible and maintained or improved function and QOL, thereby providing the basis for larger future interventions with longer follow‐up. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|ObjectiveWe {{reviewed}} {{our experience}} with preoperative chemoradiotherapy {{in patients with}} adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus and pretreatment endoscopic ultrasonography-identified celiac adenopathy. MethodsOne hundred eighty-six patients with adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus were staged with endoscopic ultrasonography before treatment from 1997 through 2004. All patients were treated with <b>concurrent</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> (CRT group) and surgical intervention or induction chemotherapy followed by <b>concurrent</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> (C→CRT group) and surgical intervention. Survival analysis (excluding operative mortality) evaluated various pretreatment factors. ResultsMultivariable Cox regression analysis showed that pretreatment endoscopic ultrasonography-identified celiac adenopathy {{was a significant predictor}} of decreased long-term survival (P =. 03). Median and 3 -year survivals were 49 months and 54 % in the endoscopic ultrasonography-identified cN 0 M 0 group (n = 65), 45 months and 56 % in the endoscopic ultrasonography-identified cN 1 M 0 group (n = 96), and 19 months and 12 % in the endoscopic ultrasonography-identified celiac adenopathy (cM 1 a) group (n = 18; P =. 03). Increased systemic relapse was noted in the endoscopic ultrasonography-identified cM 1 a group (44 % vs 22 %, P =. 07). The only factor associated with increased survival in the endoscopic ultrasonography-identified cM 1 a group (27 vs 15 months, P =. 02) was the addition of induction chemotherapy before <b>concurrent</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> and surgical intervention. ConclusionsEndoscopic ultrasonography-identified celiac adenopathy in patients with adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus conveys a poor prognosis despite preoperative chemoradiotherapy. These patients should be stratified in future multimodality trials. The investigation of induction chemotherapy before <b>concurrent</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> might be warranted in this high-risk group of patients...|$|E

Methods: Between November 2004 and November 2011, 240 patients with FIGO stage IIB cervical carcinoma were analyzed, comprising 119 patients treated with <b>concurrent</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> followed by radical surgery (group 1) and 121 patients treated with <b>concurrent</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> followed by high-dose-rate intracavitary brachytherapy (group 2). Local control, overall survival, progression-free survival, and treatment-related complications were compared between the two groups. Results: The median follow-up duration was 36 months. <b>Concurrent</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> followed by radical surgery showed a survival benefit when comparing group 1 and group 2 (3 -year overall survival, 94. 9 % versus 84. 6 %, P= 0. 011; 3 -year progression-free survival, 91. 0 % versus 81. 8 %, P= 0. 049, respectively). Three-year local pelvic control was 94. 6 % in group 1 and 93. 3 % in group 2 (P= 0. 325). Prognostic factors in group 1 were: age (≤ 35 years versus > 35 years), 3 -year progression-free survival (74. 1 % versus 90. 9 %, P= 0. 037); tumor diameter (≥ 6 cm versus < 6 cm); and 3 -year progression-free survival, (60. 6 % versus 92. 9 %, P= 0. 004). Prognostic factors in group 2 were: tumor diameter (≥ 4 cm versus < 4 cm); 3 -year overall survival (78. 0 % versus 94. 8 %, P= 0. 043); tumor diameter (≥ 6 cm versus < 6 cm); 3 -year progression-free survival (42. 9 % versus 84. 2 %, P= 0. 032); and 3 -year overall survival (42. 9 % versus 87. 1 %, P= 0. 013). Further, 50 patients (42. 02 %) in group 1 and 46 patients (38. 02 %) in group 2 suffered from late complications. Analysis of the difference in composition of late complications showed that the rate of leg edema was higher in group 1 (35. 29 % versus 4. 96 %, P= 0. 000) while the rate of radiation enteritis was higher in group 2 (30. 58 % versus 5. 04 %, P= 0. 000).

40|$|Introduction:Mature {{results are}} {{presented}} from a phase II trial of postoperative <b>concurrent</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> in patients with poor-prognosis cancer of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction after primary surgical resection. Methods:Resected patients with a pathologic stage of T 3, N 1, or M 1 a were eligible for this trial. <b>Concurrent</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> was begun between 6 and 10 weeks after surgery and consisted of radiotherapy (1. 8 Gy/d to a planned dose of 50. 4 - 59. 4 Gy), concurrent with two cycles of 5 -fluorouracil (1000 mg/m 2 /d) and cisplatin (20 mg/m 2 /d), both given as 4 -day continuous intravenous infusions during the first and fourth weeks of the radiation. Results:Between 1995 and 2006, 50 patients were enrolled. The median age was 59 (range, 33 - 76) years, and most patients were male (86 %), Caucasian (96 %), and had undergone a transthoracic esophagogastrectomy (74 %) for what {{proved to be a}} node positive (86 %) adenocarcinoma (86 %). Postoperative <b>concurrent</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> was accompanied by neutropenia requiring hospitalization for fever in only four patients (8 %) and no toxic deaths. With a median follow-up of 47 (range, 36 - 124) months, the Kaplan-Meier 4 -year projected overall survival is 51 %, freedom from recurrence 50 %, distant metastatic control 56 %, and locoregional control 86 %. An earlier pathologic stage was the only predictor for a better outcome. Conclusions:This schedule of postoperative <b>concurrent</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> has acceptable toxicity for patients with poor-prognosis esophageal and gastroesophageal junction cancer after surgery.

40|$|BackgroundDuring lobectomy, {{resection}} of pulmonary artery, {{followed by}} reconstruction or replacement {{with or without}} concomitant sleeve bronchial resection, is feasible in selected cases. We report morbidity, mortality, and technical issues in pulmonary artery replacement using a cryopreserved arterial allograft after sleeve resection for centrally located non–small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). MethodsWe reviewed clinical and pathologic data of patients who underwent arterial sleeve lobectomy with pulmonary artery replacement in our institution from 2007 to 2012. ResultsOf 178 centrally located NSCLCs, sleeve resections were performed in 92 (51 %), pneumonectomies in 33 (18 %), and lobectomies in 53 (31 %). Of the 32 (34. 7 %) pulmonary) reconstructions (excluding tangential suture), 20 (21. 7 %) were end-to-end anastomosis, 2 (2. 1 %) were pericardial patch reconstructions, and 10 (11 %) were PA replacements. Clinical T staging was cT 2 a in 4 patients, cT 2 b in 3, cT 3 in 2, and cT 4 in 1. Four patients received <b>concurrent</b> induction <b>chemoradiotherapy.</b> Three patients underwent a double-sleeve right lobectomy. Cryopreserved allografts used were descending thoracic aorta (n =  3) and pulmonary arteries (n =  7). Complete resection (R 0) was achieved in all patients. Final N staging was pN 0 (n =  4), pN 1 (n =  5), and pN 2 (n =  1). There was no operative mortality. Four patients had major morbidity, including 1 early conduit thrombosis treated by pneumonectomy completion. Graft patency, assessed by contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan, was 90 %. Mean follow-up was 25 ± 14 (range, 8 - 47) months (30 % for > 36 months). Overall 5 -year survival was 66. 7 %, and the estimated median disease-free survival was 42 months. ConclusionsIn central NSCLCs, conservative surgery using a cryopreserved arterial allograft to replace the pulmonary artery after extended segmental resection could avoid pneumonectomy in selected patients...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundIt has {{not been}} fully {{evaluated}} whether both HER 2 gene copy number and HER 2 protein expression {{are related to the}} outcome of chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC). The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate their relationships. MethodsHER 2 gene copy number determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and HER 2 protein expression determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) were assessed in 68 patients with LA-NSCLC enrolled in our previous phase II trials of <b>concurrent</b> cisplatin-based <b>chemoradiotherapy,</b> and a multivariate analysis was conducted for response and survival. ResultsHER 2 -IHC-positive tumors were detected in 23 patients (34 %), and the median ratio of HER 2 to chromosome 17 copy number was 0. 93 (range, 0. 55 – 2. 00). The HER 2 -FISH results were marginally correlated with the IHC results (p = 0. 0715). When the median ratio in the FISH analysis was used as a cut-off level for its positivity, there was no association between either HER 2 -FISH or IHC status and objective response to chemoradiotherapy. Contrary, a multivariate analysis revealed HER 2 -FISH result but not IHC result was an independent poor prognostic factor for both overall survival and progression-free survival (hazard ratio = 2. 568, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1. 117 – 5. 903, p = 0. 0264 and hazard ratio = 2. 283, 95 % CI = 1. 005 – 5. 189, p = 0. 0487, respectively).

40|$|AIM: The goal of {{the present}} work was to compare {{outcomes}} of definitive <b>concurrent</b> cisplatin-based <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> (CRT) with cetuximab-based bioradiotherapy (BRT) in locally advanced head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2006 and 2012, 265  patients with locally advanced HNSCC were treated at our institution with CRT (n[*]=[*] 194; 73 [*]%) with three cycles of cisplatin (100  mg/m(2), every 3  weeks) or BRT (n[*]=[*] 71; 27 [*]%) with weekly cetuximab. Patients receiving BRT had more pre-existing conditions (Charlson index ≥[*] 2) than the CRT group (p[*]=[*] 0. 005). RESULTS: Median follow-up was 29 months. In all, 56 [*]% of patients treated with CRT received the planned three cycles (92 [*]% at least two cycles) and 79 [*]% patients treated with BRT received six cycles or more. The 2 -year actuarial overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 72 [*]% and 61 [*]%, respectively. In the multivariate analysis (MVA), T 4  stage, N 2 - 3 stage, smoking status (current smoker as compared with never smoker), and non-oropharyngeal locations predicted for OS, whereas BRT association with OS was of borderline significance (p[*]=[*] 0. 054). The 2 -year actuarial locoregional control (LRC) and distant control (DC) rates were 73 and 79 [*]%, respectively. CRT was independently associated with an improved LRC (2 -year LRC: 76 [*]% for CRT vs. 61 [*]% for BRT) and DC (2 -year LRC: 81 [*]% for CRT vs. 68 [*]% for BRT) in comparison with BRT (p[*]<[*] 0. 001 and p[*]=[*] 0. 01 in the MVA). Subgroup analyses showed that T 4 patients benefited significantly from CRT (vs. BRT) in LRC, while T 1 - 3 did not. BRT patients had more G 3 - 4 skin complications (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) and CRT patients had higher rates of feeding tube placement (p[*]=[*] 0. 006) and G 3 - 4 gastrointestinal toxicities (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). CONCLUSION: This retrospective analysis showed a better LRC in locally advanced HNSCC treated by cisplatin-based CRT than cetuximab-based BRT, and a nonsignificant trend towards an improved OS...|$|R
