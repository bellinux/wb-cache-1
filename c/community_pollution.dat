40|$|There {{has been}} a serious concern about declining water quality in the rivers and streams since 1960. Wide varities of {{pollutants}} {{have been reported to}} cause deterioration of water quality in rivers. Tungabhadra River in Karnataka is an important tributary of Krishna. It has a drainage area of 71, 417 sq. km out of which 57, 671 sq. km area lies in the state of Karnataka. The river covers the distance of 293 km in the state. This river is considered as life line of this area, which fulfills the needs of hundreds of villages, situated at both sides of the river. The study was conducted to measure its various physico-chemical and bacteriological parameters including levels of algal <b>community.</b> <b>Pollution</b> in water bodies may indicate the environment of algal nutrients in water. They may also function as indicators of pollution. Hence, the present investigation is an attempt to know the pollution load through algal indicators in Tungabhadra river of Karnataka near Harihar town. The study has been conducted from May 2004 to April 2005. The water and algal samples were collected at regular intervals of 15 days at four stations for one year. The most tolerant genera and species of four groups of algae namely, Chlorophyceae, Bacilariophyceae, Cyanophyceae and Euglenophyceae indicate that total algal population is 17, 7159 o/L in station S 3; which has the influence of industrial pollution from Hariha...|$|E

40|$|Biodiversity index {{based on}} species {{richness}} and evenness {{has been a}} frequently used measure to describe phytoplankton community composition {{and the impact of}} water pollution on biotic components, despite it could not reflect clearly the impact of a particular species on the structure and function of phytoplankton community. On the contrary, an index based on the niche theory has been developed and used to elucidate the changes of phytoplankton community with the alteration of species composition under various levels of water quality. Through comparison on the Shannon-Wiener biodiversity index (H') and the <b>community</b> <b>pollution</b> value (CPV), this paper depicted the algal species composition change along the gradation of water quality and quantified the impact of species composition on the structure and function of a freshwater phytoplankton community in four urban lakes in central China. This study found that not only CPV could indicate water pollution status but also the fluctuation of CPV along water pollution gradient could show the influence of dominant species composition on community function. The comparison between Shannon-Wiener biodiversity index and CPV shows that the presence of dominant species sustains the stability and the succession of phytoplankton community under the changing water environments. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the combination of biodiversity index and CPV can provide a systematic way to understand biotic interactions and species responses to altered habitats at the community level. Most importantly, these indicators will provide valuable information for lake management and restoration practices. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Azad Kashmir has {{variety of}} {{mountain}} ecosystems which {{are rich in}} floral and faunal diversity. These ecosystems are fragile and are under stress due to various natural and anthropogenic pressures. Mountain ecosystems of Azad Kashmir are more vulnerable to global warming {{and are expected to}} show its impacts rapidly. Climate change may cause major changes in distribution ranges of different vegetation types. As a result of climate change, the area of three vegetation groups (alpine, grassland/arid woodlands and deserts) is expected to decrease and the areas of five types (cold conifer/mixed woodland, cold conifer/mixed forests, temperate conifer/mixed forests, warm conifer/mixed forests, and steppe/arid shrub lands) are expected to increase. Climate change is going to affect conservation of plant species and ecosystems by causing direct loss of plant species and intensify the effects of existing threats such as habitat degradation, deforestation and over-harvesting of plants by local <b>communities,</b> <b>pollution</b> and invasive species. These stresses, acting individually and collectively on species, communities and ecosystems, are depleting and will continue to deplete biodiversity. The negative impacts of climate change are multi-dimensional and wide-ranging. Their mitigation requires an integrated and coordinated policy response for conservation of plant resources. These measures include a regular monitoring and observation system, restoration of degraded habitats and forests, identifying new solutions involving cross-sectoral linkages to conserve biological diversity of Azad Kashmir by supporting the intricate and complex responses of species and ecosystems to climate change...|$|R

50|$|By {{promoting}} pollution reduction, the Clean Air Act {{can help}} reduce heightened exposure to air <b>pollution</b> among <b>communities</b> of color and low-income communities. Environmental researcher Dr. Marie Lynn Miranda notes that African American populations are “consistently overrepresented” in areas with the poorest air quality. Dense populations of low-income and minority communities inhabit the most polluted areas across the United States, which is considered to exacerbate health problems among these populations. High levels of exposure to air pollution is linked to several health conditions, including asthma, cancer, premature death, and infant mortality, each of which disproportionately impact communities of color and low-income <b>communities.</b> The <b>pollution</b> reduction achieved by the Clean Air Act {{is associated with a}} decline in each of these conditions and can promote environmental justice for communities that are disproportionately impacted by air pollution and diminished health status.|$|R
40|$|Urban {{and forest}} {{habitats}} differ in many aspects {{that can lead}} to modifications of the immune system of wild animals. Altered parasite <b>communities,</b> <b>pollution,</b> and artificial light at night in cities have been associated with exacerbated inflammatory responses, with possibly negative fitness consequences, but few data are available from free-living animals. Here, we investigate how urbanization affects major immune pathways and experimentally test potentially contributing factors in blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) from an urban and forest site. We first compared breeding adults by quantifying the mRNA transcript levels of proteins associated with anti-bacterial, anti-malarial (TLR 4, LY 86) and anti-helminthic (Type 2 transcription factor GATA 3) immune responses. Adult urban and forest blue tits differed in gene expression, with significantly increased TLR 4 and GATA 3, but not LY 86, in the city. We then experimentally tested whether these differences were environmentally induced by cross-fostering eggs between the sites and measuring mRNA transcripts in nestlings. The populations differed in reduced reproductive success, with a lower fledging success and lower fledgling weight recorded at the urban site. This mirrors the findings of our twin study reporting that the urban site was severely resource limited when compared to the forest. Because of low urban survival, robust gene expression data were only obtained from nestlings reared in the forest. Transcript levels in these nestlings showed no (TLR 4, LY 86), or weak (GATA 3), differences according to their origin from forest or city nests, suggesting little genetic or maternal contribution to nestling immune transcript levels. Lastly, to investigate differences in parasite pressure between urban and forest sites, we measured the prevalence of malaria in adult and nestling blood. Prevalence was invariably high across environments and not associated with the transcript levels of the studied immune genes. Our results support the hypothesis that inflammatory pathways are activated in an urban environment and suggest that these differences are most likely induced by environmental factors...|$|R
40|$|In Southern California, {{terrestrial}} runoff pollution often drains {{directly onto}} the beach, degrading water quality and leading to increased beach closures each year. Beaches are a significant piston in California’s economic engine and beach closures can have significant economic impact on local <b>communities.</b> Runoff <b>pollution</b> can be localized, as from a storm drain, or can be more diffuse with many smaller, distributed sources. In either case, upon entering ocean waters, the pollution is first mixed, dispersed, and advected within the surfzone (the region of breaking waves). However, behavior of polluted waters upon entering the surfzone is not understood, and advancing this understanding is crucial to improved beach water quality.

However, some areas with a concentration of certain industries still have considerable particulate pollution. Since emission of nitrogen dioxide is increasing in the United States, the consequent photochemical pollution in southern Ontario will probably continue to increase.

30|$|Struggling for {{achieving}} sustainable retail {{operations in the}} cities is also another critical issue for retailers. Sustainability per se, includes areas that are not of utmost importance for the retail companies. For instance, these could be external costs, ‘social’ impacts on local <b>communities,</b> air <b>pollution,</b> etc. As corporate responsibility emerges more and more retailers become interested on efficient utilization of their resources, and thus, mitigating externalities. Public policy holds a very important role; {{by the time that}} ‘polluter-pays’ principle is legally and broadly imposed, operators would be compelled to fundamentally reconsider the level of sustainability in their operations. And this because they might be legally forced to reduce the environmental footprint of their operations in order to cope with new costs. In general, sustainability culture in the retail sector could be promoted mainly through the introduction – in the form of regulatory or legal frameworks - of tailored mechanisms that aim at internalizing the externalities produced by retailers.|$|R

[...] After a temporary retreat, the government attempted to restart the project, but the unions voted to reaffirm the ban. Hamer retaliated by suspending 300 construction projects and announcing a new law that would require secret ballots for construction bans, on pain of deregistration of the union involved. The aggression successfully forced a gradual retreat by the union leadership, under added pressure from the poor economic climate.|$|R
