25|$|Pangolins, {{a type of}} mammal {{covered in}} thick scales, roll into a tight ball when threatened. Pangolins have been {{reported}} to roll away from danger, by both gravity and self-powered methods. A pangolin in hill country in Sumatra, to flee from the researcher, ran {{to the edge of a}} slope and <b>curled</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> ball to roll down the slope, crashing through the vegetation, and covering an estimated 30 metres or more in 10 seconds.|$|E
2500|$|The hammer {{heads in}} Cristofori's mature pianos (A) {{are made of}} paper, <b>curled</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> {{circular}} coil and secured with glue, and surmounted by a strip of leather at the contact point with the string. According to harpsichord maker and scholar Denzil Wraight, such hammers {{have their origin in}} [...] "15th-century paper organ pipe technology". The purpose of the leather is presumably to make the hammers softer, thus emphasizing the lower harmonics of string vibration by maintaining a broad area of contact at impact. The same goal of softness was achieved in later 18th-century pianos by covering the wooden hammers with soft leather, and in mid-19th-century and later instruments by covering a wooden core with a thick layer of compressed felt.|$|E

60|$|Sir Terence stood {{facing them}} again. He was a changed man. The fire had all {{gone out of}} him. His head was bowed and his face looked haggard and {{suddenly}} old. His lip <b>curled</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> sneer.|$|E
60|$|The frown {{which had}} {{gathered}} around the handsome, open, and manly brow of Heyward, gradually relaxed, and his lips <b>curled</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> slight smile, as he regarded the stranger. Alice made no very powerful effort to control her merriment; and even the dark, thoughtful eye of Cora lighted with a humor that, it would seem, the habit, rather than {{the nature of its}} mistress repressed.|$|E

60|$|He {{moved his}} {{position}} and came {{within the range of}} her terrified vision. Hurd's twenty pounds and a little more added to it had done wonders. He wore correct evening clothes, correctly worn. Except for his good looks--the good looks of a devil--he would have attracted notice nowhere. He leaned against the couch, and though his lips <b>curled</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> sneer, there was a flame in his eyes, a horrible admiration.|$|E
60|$|As he came {{his upper}} lip <b>curled</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> snarl, exposing his {{fighting}} fangs, and a deep growl rumbled from his cavernous chest. Taug looked up, batting his blood-shot eyes. Teeka half raised herself and looked at Tarzan. Did she guess {{the cause of his}} perturbation? Who may say? At any rate, she was feminine, and so she reached up and scratched Taug behind one of his small, flat ears.|$|E
6000|$|He stared askance {{at her for}} a moment, {{then his}} full lips <b>curled</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> sneer. [...] "Of course you would seek to justify them," [...] he said. [...] "You are of that foul brood yourself. But you cannot think to cozen me, who am of clean Old-christian blood and a true son of Mother Church. These men plot evil against the Holy Inquisition. Is that not Judaizing when it is done by Jews?" ...|$|E

60|$|Hogan, {{standing}} squarely {{upon the}} hearth, was beset {{by the desire}} to kick Master Kenneth, or Master Jocelyn, into the street. His lip <b>curled</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> sneer of ineffable contempt, for his shrewd eyes read {{to the bottom of the}} lad's mean soul and saw there clearly writ the confidence that emboldened him to voice that insult to the man he must know for his father. Standing there, he compared the two, marvelling deeply how they came to be father and son. A likeness he saw now between them, yet a likeness that seemed but to mark the difference. The one harsh, resolute, and manly, for all his reckless living and his misfortunes; the other mild, effeminate, hypocritical and shifty. He read it not on their countenances alone, but in every line of their figures as they stood, and in his heart he cursed himself for having been the instrument to disclose the relationship in which they stood.|$|E
60|$|The Re-expansion of the Tentacles.--This {{movement}} is always slow and gradual. When {{the centre of}} the leaf is excited, or a leaf is immersed in a proper solution, all the tentacles bend directly towards the centre, and afterwards directly back from it. But when the point of excitement is {{on one side of the}} disc, the surrounding tentacles bend towards it, and therefore obliquely with respect to their normal direction; when they afterwards re-expand, they bend obliquely back, so as to recover their original positions. The tentacles farthest from an excited point, wherever that may be, are the last and the least affected, and probably in consequence of this they are the first to re-expand. The bent portion of a closely inflected tentacle is in a state of active contraction, as shown by the following experiment. Meat was placed on a leaf, and after the tentacles were closely inflected and had quite ceased to move, narrow strips of the disc, with a few of the outer tentacles attached to it, were cut off and laid on one side under the microscope. After several failures, I succeeded in cutting off the convex surface of the bent portion of a tentacle. Movement immediately recommenced, and the already greatly bent portion went on bending until it formed a perfect circle; the straight distal portion of the tentacle passing on one side of the strip. The convex surface must therefore have previously been in a state of tension, sufficient to counter-balance that of the concave surface, which, when free, <b>curled</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> complete ring.|$|E
60|$|Instead {{of going}} to bed she made as {{brilliant}} a light as she could and began to pack, working diligently, though all the while visited by the scenes that might {{take place on the}} coming day--now by the tiresome explanations and farewells, and the whirling journey toward a changed home, now by the alternative of staying just another day and standing again at the roulette-table. But always in this latter scene there was the presence of that Deronda, watching her with exasperating irony, and--the two keen experiences were inevitably revived together--beholding her again forsaken by luck. This importunate image certainly helped to sway her resolve on the side of immediate departure, and to urge her packing to the point which would make a change of mind inconvenient. It had struck twelve when she came into her room, and {{by the time she was}} assuring herself that she had left out only what was necessary, the faint dawn was stealing through the white blinds and dulling her candles. What was the use {{of going to}} bed? Her cold bath was refreshment enough, and she saw that a slight trace of fatigue about the eyes only made her look the more interesting. Before six o'clock she was completely equipped in her gray traveling dress even to her felt hat, for she meant to walk out as soon as she could count on seeing other ladies on their way to the springs. And happening to be seated sideways before the long strip of mirror between her two windows she turned to look at herself, leaning her elbow on the back of the chair in an attitude that might have been chosen for her portrait. It is possible to have a strong self-love without any self-satisfaction, rather with a self-discontent which is the more intense because one's own little core of egoistic sensibility is a supreme care; but Gwendolen knew nothing of such inward strife. She had a naïve delight in her fortunate self, which any but the harshest saintliness will have some indulgence for in a girl who had every day seen a pleasant reflection of that self in her friends' flattery as well as in the looking-glass. And even in this beginning of troubles, while for lack of anything else to do she sat gazing at her image in the growing light, her face gathered a complacency gradual as the cheerfulness of the morning. Her beautiful lips <b>curled</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> more and more decided smile, till at last she took off her hat, leaned forward and kissed the cold glass which had looked so warm. How could she believe in sorrow? If it attacked her, she felt the force to crush it, to defy it, or run away from it, as she had done already. Anything seemed more possible than that she could go on bearing miseries, great or small.|$|E
50|$|Pangolins have a {{thick layer}} of {{protective}} scales made from keratin, the same material that makes up human fingernails and rhinoceros horns. Scales account for about 20% of the animal's weight. When threatened, pangolins <b>curl</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> ball, using the scales as armor to defend against predators.|$|R
