40|$|Debt arrears {{occur when}} {{scheduled}} payments (repayment of principal or coupons) {{are not made}} by their due-for-payment date. The current statistical manuals seem to follow two separate bases for time of recording for repayments of debts. I. Current international standards for the statistical treatment of the issue In general, all macroeconomic statistics use the accrual basis for determining time of recording. However, the treatment differs for arrears. The External Debt Statistics: Guide for Compilers and Users (External Debt Guide) defines arrears as amounts that are past due-forpayment and unpaid (paras. 3. 36, 3. 37). The time of recording basis followed in the BPM 5 (paras. 123, 528), External Debt Guide (paras. 2. 29, 3. 36), and Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001; para. 9. 19) is that when a <b>debt</b> <b>liability</b> goes into arrears, transactions are imputed as if the repayment of <b>debt</b> <b>liability</b> had been made and a new short-term liability created. This time of recording basis conforms with the due-for-payment basis as repayments are recorded {{at the time they}} are due. The treatment followed, in principle, in the 1993 SNA (paras. 3. 94 and 11. 101) and Monetar...|$|R
40|$|The War for Independence {{left the}} National Government deeply in debt. The spoils from winning that war also gave it an empire of land. So, post- 1783, was the National Government solvent? Was its net asset position, land assets minus <b>debt</b> <b>liabilities,</b> {{positive}} or negative? Evidence is gathered {{to answer this}} question by constructing a yearly time series of its net asset position, including time series of the subcomponents of that position, from 1784 through 1802. The answer to this question may help explain the constraints that determined why the National Debt was funded in the particular way that it was. The results from the data series constructed indicate that the National Government was solvent, had more than enough land assets to cover its <b>debt</b> <b>liabilities,</b> in this period but only if it maintained the default on the Continental Dollar (its non-interest-bearing debt). To do this and not ruin its creditworthiness it had to distinguish, legally and in the marketplace, between its interest-bearing and its non-interest-bearing debt. It did this, in part, by only paying interest and no principal on its debts and by curtailing direct swaps of land for debt. ...|$|R
