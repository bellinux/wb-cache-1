50|$|Data {{indicate}} that cefquinome has high antibacterial activity in vitro against nearly all strains tested. In general, cefquinome {{is within the}} same range as <b>cefpirome</b> and cefotaxime. Against Gram-negative species, cefquinome has very limited in vitro activity. The in vitro activity of cefquinome {{does not depend on}} the composition or pH of the test medium. The broad antibacterial spectrum and the high in vitro activity are reflected by high in vivo efficacy in experimental infections. In mouse models of septicemia, cefquinome possessed high therapetic efficacy. All infections were cured.|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of <b>cefpirome</b> and a cephalosporinase from Citrobacter freundii, including hydrolysis and inhibition, was studied {{in comparison with}} those of cefotiam, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime. <b>Cefpirome</b> was hydrolyzed by the enzyme more rapidly at Vmax than were cefotaxime and ceftazidime. However, the low affinity of the enzyme for <b>cefpirome</b> caused {{a reduction in the}} hydrolytic rate of <b>cefpirome</b> at a low drug concentration (0. 1 microM). The high stability of <b>cefpirome</b> at a low concentration explains the high antimicrobial activity of the agent against cephalosporinase-producing bacteria...|$|E

Its pharmacokinetic profile in pouch exudate was also examined. <b>Cefpirome</b> showed bactericidal effects and long-lasting bacterial growth-inhibitory effects in granuloma pouches infected in Escherichia coli Ec- 7, and its effects were almost equal to those of the other antibiotics. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa TM- 11 infection, <b>cefpirome</b> was more active than moxalactam, cefoperazone, and cefotaxime and comparable to ceftazidime. <b>Cefpirome</b> had the strongest activity against Staphylococcus aureus Smith infection among the five antibiotics, showing bactericidal effects and long-lasting bacterial growth-inhibitory effects. The level of <b>cefpirome</b> in pouch exudate peaked at 1 h after administration, with a value of 16. 4 micrograms/ml, and declined in a pattern similar to that of ceftazidime. When compared in peak level, the exudate level of <b>cefpirome</b> was 1. 8 to 2. 6 times higher than the values of moxalactam, cefoperazone, and cefotaxime.

40|$|The {{susceptibility}} of 47 clinical isolates of methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus (MRSA) to <b>cefpirome,</b> ceftazidime and methicillin {{was determined}} with Isosensitest media, with/without 5 % NaCl and incubation at 30 °, 37 ° and 44 °C for 24 and 48 h. At 24 h the MIC 50 of <b>cefpirome</b> was 8 mg/l compared to 64 mg/l ceftazidime; at 48 h this increased to 32 mg/l <b>cefpirome.</b> The addition of 10 mg/l clavulanic acid or sulbactam lowered the MIC of <b>cefpirome</b> (at 48 h) by greater than four-fold in 23 % and 11 % of the strains, respectively. <b>Cefpirome</b> had primary affinity for penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 1 and 2 in five MRSA and one methicillin-susceptibleStaphylococcus aureus. PBP 2 a {{was present in}} all MRSA and was not saturated by 64 mg/l <b>cefpirome.</b> Clavulanic acid at a concentration of 10 mg/l bound to PBP 2 by > 50 % in all strains, and when combined with <b>cefpirome,</b> the density of PBP 2 a was also reduced but not completely abolished.

40|$|With <b>cefpirome</b> (HR 810) the MICs {{for both}} methicillin-rcsistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and for Streptococcus faecalis were 8 - 0 mg/ 1. At 4 x MIC, <b>cefpirome</b> killed MRSA {{as rapidly as}} did {{vancomycin}} while for enterococci, <b>cefpirome,</b> vancomycin or ampicillin alone were not bactericidal. However, all agents were bactericidal when combined with 2 mg/ 1 of gentamicin, although gentamicin combined with <b>cefpirome</b> showed a smaller decrease in cfu/ml than the combination with ampicillin or vancomycin. A mouse thigh infection model was developed in which the thigh muscle was infected with bacteria and either no therapy or concurrent antibiotic therapy was initiated. On the subsequent day, the entire thigh muscle was quantitatively cultured. In this model, the numbers of enterococci at the infection site at 24 h were reduced by 2 - 1 logs with no treatment, 2 - 6 with <b>cefpirome</b> (25 mg/kg/day), 2 - 8 with ampicillin (150 mg/kg/day), and 2 - 7 with vancomycin (25 mg/kg/day). For MRSA the reductions were 11 logs with no therapy, 2 - 8 with vancomycin, and 3 - 0 with <b>cefpirome.</b> The apparent enhanced in-vivo activity of <b>cefpirome</b> for MRSA argues for further evaluation of this antibiotic for treatment of MRSA and other Gram-positive cocci, including enterococci...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cefpirome</b> {{is a new}} investigational cephalosporin. We {{designed}} a study to determine the pharmacokinetics and tolerance of <b>cefpirome</b> in pediatric patients. A single dose of <b>cefpirome</b> was administered intravenously over 15 min to 18 patients (age 0. 5 to 18 years). The doses were 10 mg/kg of body weight for five patients, 25 mg/kg of body weight for seven patients, and 50 mg/kg of body weight for six patients. Blood samples were collected at 0, 0. 25, 0. 5, 1, 3, 5, and 8 h after the dose, and <b>cefpirome</b> was measured by a high-performance liquid chromatography method. The maximum concentration in serum ranged from about 53. 6 to 454 micrograms/ml after doses of 10 to 50 mg/kg. The total body clearance, apparent volume of distribution, and elimination half-life were 2. 15 +/- 0. 70 ml/min/kg, 0. 32 +/- 0. 32 liter/kg, and 1. 8 +/- 1. 3 h, respectively. No significant adverse effects were attributed to <b>cefpirome.</b> These data {{may be useful in}} conducting efficacy and safety studies of <b>cefpirome</b> in pediatric patients...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to gather the {{epidemiological}} data on the susceptibility patterns of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus against fourth generation cephalosporins (<b>Cefpirome</b> and Cefepime). Total 100 isolates of each bacterial species were collected from central laboratories of different private hospitals of Karachi, Pakistan between September 2012 and December 2012. Modified Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method was used for the determination of sensitivity of <b>Cefpirome</b> and Cefepime using strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) and staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538) as control. In-vitro comparative susceptibility patterns of <b>Cefpirome</b> and Cefepime were studied. Isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were found to be resistant, 15 % against Cefepime and 18 % against <b>Cefpirome</b> while that of staphylococcus aureus were 3 % against Cefepime and 5 % against <b>Cefpirome.</b> Results clarify that Pseudomonas aeruginosa is more resistant as compare to staphylococcus aureus against both of the fourth generation cephalosporins. It is concluded from this study that Cefepime and <b>Cefpirome</b> are highly effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus and can be used safely in the treatment of infections caused by these organisms...|$|E
40|$|An observer-blind randomized, placebo-controlled, {{crossover}} {{study was conducted}} in 22 healthy male subjects.

The treatments were reversed after a seven-day *washout ' period. Subjects were evaluated for any adverse events or 'disulfiram-like ' symptoms. The effects of <b>cefpirome</b> on the pharmacolrinetics of alcohol were also studied. There were no statistically significant differences in mean values for the various phannacokinetic parameters for plasma alcohol between the <b>cefpirome</b> and placebo treatment groups. There were no side effects or 'disulfiram-like ' reactions following consumption of alcohol in either group. A single iv dose of 2 g <b>cefpirome</b> was well-tolerated in healthy males and, moreover, pre-treatment with <b>cefpirome</b> did not adversely affect the metabolism of alcohol in these subjects...|$|E
40|$|The {{disposition}} of <b>cefpirome</b> after single intramuscular (i. m.) administration (10 mg. kg- 1) {{was investigated in}} five male cross-bred calves and in vitro plasma protein binding was determined. The concentration of <b>cefpirome</b> in the plasma was estimated by the microbiological assay technique. Binding of <b>cefpirome</b> to plasma proteins was determined at different concentration levels by the equilibrium dialysis technique. The peak plasma level of <b>cefpirome</b> after i. m. administration to cattle was attained at 45 min post-dose and the drug was detected in plasma above MIC of 0. 5 μg. mL- 1 for up to 10 h. The drug disposition followed a one-compartment open model. The values of t t and AUC were 0. 21 ± 0. 01 h, 2. 06 ± 0. 02 h and 31. 7 ± 0. 95 μg. mL 1 / 2 Ka, 1 / 2 β- 1. h, respectively. <b>Cefpirome</b> was bound to the plasma proteins {{to the extent of}} 26. 0 ± 2. 84 percent at the concentration range of 1 - 100 μg. mL- 1.

40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activity}} of <b>cefpirome,</b> a new parenteral fourth-generation cephalosporin, {{was investigated in}} the 5 university hospitals of Switzerland, and compared to 9 other antibiotics mainly used in hospitals, such as ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, piperacillin, imipenem, gentamicin, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. A total number of 992 strains collected only from intensive care units and haematology-oncology units were tested by microdilution according to NCCLS. <b>Cefpirome</b> showed an excellent activity against all Enterobacteriaceae (MIC 90 = 4 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC 90 = 1 mg/l), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC 90 = 0. 25 mg/l) and Haemophilus influenzae (MIC 90 = 0. 12 mg/l) isolates. Its activity was superior to that of third-generation cephalosporins against cephalosporinase-depressed mutants of Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii isolates (MIC 90 > 32 mg/l for third-generation cephalosporins vs 4 mg/l for <b>cefpirome).</b> The MICs of <b>cefpirome</b> of 3 strains of Klebsiella spp. with an extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase were lower (MIC 90 = 2 mg/l) than those of third-generation cephalosporins (MICs 90 > 32 mg/l).

40|$|<b>Cefpirome</b> {{sulphate}} is a fourth-generation cephem antibiotic, {{which has}} {{a broad spectrum of}} antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and-negative bacteria, and is highly stable to -lactamase. <b>Cefpirome</b> sulphate was administered to 166 patients with obstetric or gynaecological infections, and its clinical and antibacterial effect was evaluable in 139. Excluding seven patients who violated the study protocol by receiving concomitant drugs, the safety of <b>cefpirome</b> sulphate was assessed in 159 patients. In the 139 patients in whom efficacy was evaluated, the improvement rate was 80. 6 % (112 / 139) and the eradication rate 72. 6 % (45 / 62). The eradication rate for bacteria isolated from the patients {{at the start of the}} study was 84. 7 % (111 / 131). No resistance to <b>cefpirome</b> sulphate was observed in Enterococcus faecalis or Bacteroides species. Systemic erythema and nausea each occurred in one patient, and nine patients showed abnormal hepatic function test results. These results suggest that <b>cefpirome</b> sulphate is effective in the treatment of obstetric and gynaecological infections and has a good side-effect profile...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate whether <b>cefpirome,</b> a member of the latest class of broad-spectrum cephalosporins, sufficiently penetrates subcutaneous adipose tissue in septic patients. After the administration of the drug at 2 g, tissue <b>cefpirome</b> concentrations in septic patients (n = 11) and healthy controls (n = 7) were determined over a period of 4 h by means of microdialysis. To assess the antibacterial effect of <b>cefpirome</b> at the target site, the measured pharmacokinetic profiles were simulated in vitro with select strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The tissue penetration of <b>cefpirome</b> was significantly impaired in septic patients compared with that in healthy subjects. For subcutaneous adipose tissue, the area under the concentration-versus-time curve values from 0 to 240 min were 13. 11 ± 5. 20 g[*]·[*]min/liter in healthy subjects and 6. 90 ± 2. 56 g[*]·[*]min/liter in septic patients (P MIC) in tissue were greater than 60 % for pathogens for which the MIC was ≤ 4 mg/liter in all septic patients. The present data indicate that <b>cefpirome</b> is an appropriate agent for the treatment of soft tissue infections in septic patients. However, due to the high interindividual variability of the pharmacokinetics of <b>cefpirome</b> in tissue, dosing intervals of not more than 8 h should be preferred to ensure that susceptible bacterial strains are killed in each patient...|$|E

40|$|The {{rates of}} {{development}} {{of resistance to}} ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefepime, and <b>cefpirome</b> in 10 strains of Enterobacter cloacae were determined by daily transfer for 7 days to fresh medium containing twofold serial dilutions of the antibiotics. Development of resistance to ceftriaxone was the most rapid; {{this was followed by}} ceftazidime, <b>cefpirome,</b> and cefepime. Resistant variants selected by ceftriaxone and ceftazidime were cross-resistant and produced very high levels of beta-lactamase. On the other hand, resistant variants selected by cefepime and <b>cefpirome</b> often had moderately high levels of beta-lactamase and diminished levels of the 39 - to 40 -kDa porin protein...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cefpirome</b> {{was highly}} stable to {{hydrolysis}} by various beta-lactamases, {{although it was}} hydrolyzed to some extent by R plasmid-mediated penicillinase of Richmond-Sykes type Va/b and by chromosomal cephalosporinases from Bacteroides species. The compound had a very low affinity for cephalosporinases from Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, and Proteus vulgaris. <b>Cefpirome</b> showed strong antimicrobial activity against eight beta-lactamase (cephalosporinase) -producing strains which have become resistant to broad-spectrum cephalosporins; especially against E. cloacae and C. freundii, it had the highest activity among the cephalosporins used. Its activity against ampicillin-resistant R plasmid-containing transconjugant isolates of Escherichia coli was as high as that against the recipient strain E. coli chi 1037. The inducer activity of <b>cefpirome</b> in S. marcescens and P. vulgaris increased dose dependently, whereas cephamycin derivatives showed high inducer activity at low concentrations. A relatively low affinity of <b>cefpirome</b> for beta-lactamases {{is considered to be}} one of the reasons for its high antimicrobial activity against such enzyme-producing strains.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of cefazolin or <b>cefpirome</b> alone or combined with rifampin was {{compared with that}} of vancomycin alone or combined with rifampin in an experimental model of methicillin-resistant, beta-lactamase-producing, coagulase-negative staphylococcal endocarditis. Phenotypically, the mecA gene-positive strain used in vivo did not exhibit methicillin resistance by the agar dilution or disk susceptibility method but was resistant in vitro (oxacillin MIC, 64 micrograms/ml) by the microtiter dilution method with 2 % NaCl supplementation. Macrodilution broth susceptibilities of standard inocula failed to demonstrate cross-resistance of staphylococci to cefazolin (MIC, 8 micrograms/ml) or <b>cefpirome</b> (MIC, 4 micrograms/ml). In vivo, vancomycin and <b>cefpirome</b> had similar activities, and both regimens were more effective than was cefazolin alone. While the MIC of rifampin was low (0. 031 micrograms/ml), monotherapy with rifampin resulted in a bimodal distribution of outcomes due to the expected emergence of resistant mutants. The results in vitro of time-kill synergy studies using rifampin in combination with cefazolin or <b>cefpirome</b> varied with the antimicrobial concentrations tested and did not reliably predict activities in vivo of rifampin-beta-lactam combination therapies. <b>Cefpirome,</b> but not cefazolin or vancomycin, in combination with rifampin was synergistic in vivo. <b>Cefpirome</b> in combination with rifampin was more effective than was cefazolin in combination with rifampin. Both cephalosporin-rifampin regimens were significantly more effective than was cephalosporin or vancomycin monotherapy and were as effective as vancomycin combined with rifampin. These data support further evaluation of rifampin-beta-lactam combinations as possible alternative therapies to vancomycin-containing regimens for selected methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcal infections...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{develop a}} {{population}} pharmacokinetics model for <b>cefpirome</b> in ICU patients, to assess pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic profiles vs. MIC distribution of likely ICU pathogens, {{and to assess}} their expected cumulative fraction of response (CFR). Design and setting: Prospective observational study in a multidisciplinary ICU. Mesaurements and results: Twelve patients received 2 g <b>cefpirome</b> intravenously over 12 h. Thirteen blood samples were taken on two occasions. Demographic and creatinine clearance data were collected. Based on the final covariate model obtained using NONMEM, Monte Carlo simulations were undertaken to simulate free-drug concentrations for two administration methods: intermittent bolus administration (IBA) and continuous infusion (CI) with a loading dose of 0. 5 g. Concentration-time profiles were evaluated by the probability of achieving free-drug concentrations above the MIC for more than 65 % of dosing interval. Using MIC distributions from the EUCAST programme the CFR for each method was evaluated. A three-compartment model with zero-order input best described the concentration-time data. The CFR for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. was greater than 97 % in all IBA and CI doses but for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter spp. achieved target concentrations of 56 % and 46 %, respectively. High-dose CI <b>cefpirome</b> (6 g/day) for P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. was required to achieve CFR of 89 %. Conclusion: Measured creatinine clearance {{appears to be a}} good marker of <b>cefpirome</b> clearance and potentially could be used to individualise <b>cefpirome</b> therapy. When given as IBA or CI for E. coli and Klebsiella spp., <b>cefpirome</b> should be successful. <b>Cefpirome</b> fails to achieve the bactericidal target even when administered at high-doses such as 6 g/day for P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. Prospective clinical studies are needed to conclusively validate these findings...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrochemical}} reduction behavior of cefepime and <b>cefpirome</b> {{has been studied}} using cyclic voltammetry in Britton Robinson (BR) buffer ranging from pH 2. 0 to 12. 0. Cefepime and <b>cefpirome</b> are found to give two well defined peaks and these peaks are attributed to {{the reduction of the}} azomethine group (>C=N-) by two electron process in two steps. Kinetic parameters such as diffusion coefficient (D) and forward rate constant (Kºf,h) values are evaluated and a reduction mechanism is proposed. The result indicates that the process of both the compounds is irreversible and diffusion controlled. A simple and rapid differential pulse polarographic method has been developed for the determination of cefepime and <b>cefpirome</b> in pharmaceutical formulations and spiked urine samples using the standard addition method. The lower detection limits are found to be 4. 6 × 10 - 8 mol. L- 1 and 8. 52 × 10 - 8 mol. L- 1 for cefepime and <b>cefpirome,</b> respectively...|$|E

The percentage resistance was low for imipenem (7. 2 %), piperacillin/tazobactam (2. 8 %), cefoperazone/sulbactam (5. 4 %). However, a high frequency of resistance was observed to ticarcillin/clavulanate (83. 9 %), cefdinir (70. 6 %), cefepime (45. 5 %) and <b>cefpirome</b> (84. 4 %). We conclude that imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam and cefoperazone/sulbactam are effective antibiotics in our environment, whereas ticarcillin/clavulanate, cefdinir, cefepime and <b>cefpirome</b> are relatively uneffective...|$|E
40|$|In an international, multicenter, open-label, {{randomized}} comparative study, adult {{patients in}} intensive care units were enrolled to receive <b>cefpirome</b> intravenously at 2 g twice daily or ceftazidime intravenously at 2 g three times daily for the empiric treatment of pneumonia. Randomization was performed after a double stratification according to the investigator’s initial choice of monotherapy or combination therapy {{and then on the}} basis of the severity of disease. The primary endpoint was the clinical response at the end of treatment in the intent-to-treat population. Data for all patients were reviewed by a blinded observer. Of the 400 enrolled patients, 201 received <b>cefpirome</b> (monotherapy, 56 %) and 199 received ceftazidime (monotherapy, 51 %). Pneumonia was hospital acquired for 75 % of the patients.

For the <b>cefpirome</b> and ceftazidime groups, there were 35 versus 30 % clinical failures among monotherapy-stratified patients, respectively, and 34 versus 42 % clinical failures among combination therapy-stratified patients, respectively. The rates of clinical failures in the per-protocol analysis were 38 and 42 %, respectively.

The mortality rates within 2 weeks after the end of treatment were similar (<b>cefpirome</b> group, 31 %; ceftazidime group, 26 %), as were the percentages of patients with at least one treatment-related adverse event (17 and 19 %, respectively). An empiric treatment strategy with <b>cefpirome</b> at 2 g twice daily is equivalent in terms of efficacy and tolerance to ceftazidime at 2 g three times daily for the treatment of pneumonia in patients {{in intensive care}} units...|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} the pharmacokinetics and the serum bactericidal activities of <b>cefpirome,</b> ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. Fifteen healthy volunteers received 1 g of <b>cefpirome,</b> ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone intravenously, 500 mg of imipenem-cilastatin intravenously, and 500 mg of ciprofloxacin orally. High-performance liquid chromatographic assays {{were used to}} quantitate unchanged antibiotic in plasma and urine. Serum bactericidal activities were determined against six clinical isolates each of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by using a modified microdilution method of Reller and Stratton (L. B. Reller and C. W. Stratton, J. Infect. Dis. 136 : 196 - 204, 1977). Overall, <b>cefpirome</b> exhibited pharmacokinetics {{similar to those of}} ceftazidime: half-life (t 1 / 2), 1. 95 h; concentration at 1 h (C 1 h), 47 to 49 micrograms/ml for both antibiotics. Ceftriaxone displayed the longest t 1 / 2 (7. 65 h) and the highest C 1 h (137. 8 micrograms/ml), while we observed the shortest t 1 / 2 (1. 05 h) and the lowest C 1 h (19. 85 micrograms/ml) with imipenem. At 1 h, <b>cefpirome</b> and, even more so, imipenem showed significantly better serum bactericidal activities against S. aureus (1 : 273 and 1 : 80) than did the other antibiotics (P less than 0. 0005; analysis of variance with randomized block design and Bonferroni correction). Against E. cloacae, we observed the highest serum bactericidal titers at 1 h with <b>cefpirome,</b> and this superiority vis-à-vis the other antibiotics tested was maintained for up to 8 h after dosing. Ceftazidime remained the most active agent tested against P. aeruginosa (serum bactericidal activity titers, 1 : 43 at 1 h) up to 8 h. In summary, the study showed that <b>cefpirome</b> and imipenem provide more potent serum bactericidal activities than do broad-spectrum cephalosporins against S. aureus; thus, both of these antibiotics should be adequate against serious S. aureus infections. In addition, <b>cefpirome</b> appears to be a promising alternative for treatment of infections caused by E. cloacae and P. aeruginosa...|$|E
40|$|E 1077, a new {{injectable}} cephalosporin {{with a broad}} antibacterial {{spectrum and}} potent antibacterial activity, was evaluated for its in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities in comparison with those of <b>cefpirome,</b> cefuzonam, ceftazidime, and cefotaxime. E 1077 showed broad in vitro antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, E 1077 was as active as cefpirome; the MIC for 90 % of strains tested (MIC 90) was 1. 0 microgram/ml. Against methicillin-resistant S. aureus, E 1077 was less active (MIC 90, 64 micrograms/ml). For Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E 1077 was fourfold more active than <b>cefpirome,</b> with MIC 90 s of 1. 0 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively. For Proteus vulgaris, the MIC 90 of E 1077 was 32 micrograms/ml, which was fourfold {{greater than that of}} <b>cefpirome.</b> Against other gram-negative strains tested, the in vitro activity of E 1077 was comparable to that of <b>cefpirome.</b> The broad antibacterial spectrum of E 1077 was reflected by its in vivo efficacy against experimental septicemia caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Against S. aureus 90 and P. aeruginosa E 7, E 1077 had activity superior to those of the reference compounds; against most other bacterial strains, the efficacy of E 1077 was similar to that of <b>cefpirome.</b> Levels of E 1077 in plasma and tissue of mice were studied. At 15 min after a single subcutaneous administration, E 1077 displayed high peak levels (mean, 31. 8 +/- 3. 1 micrograms/ml). These results indicate that the in vitro and in vivo efficacies of E 1077 {{are similar to those of}} <b>cefpirome</b> except against P. aeruginosa and P. vulgaris...|$|E
40|$|E 1077 {{is a novel}} {{parenteral}} cephalosporin with a {{wide spectrum}} of potent antibacterial activity against aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.

Methicillin-resistant S. aureus was moderately to highly resistant to E 1077, but E 1077 was at least twice as active as other beta-lactams tested. Against Enterococcus faecalis, E 1077 was the most active of the cephalosporins tested (MIC 90, 12. 5 micrograms/ml) and was at least fourfold more active than <b>cefpirome</b> and ceftazidime. At concentrations of {{less than or equal to}} 0. 78 micrograms/ml, E 1077 inhibited 90 % of streptococci and most of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested, with the exceptions of Serratia marcescens and Proteus vulgaris, for which the MIC 90 s of E 1077 were both 3. 13 micrograms/ml. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E 1077 was two- to fourfold more active than <b>cefpirome</b> and ceftazidime. For the anaerobes, E 1077 was as active against Bacteroides fragilis as was cefuzonam, and its activity was fourfold higher than those of <b>cefpirome</b> and ceftazidime.

The MICs at which 50 and 90 % of isolates are inhibited (MIC 50 s and MIC 90 s, respectively) of both <b>cefpirome</b> and cefotaxime were 0. 016 and 0. 06 microgram/ml, respectively, for penicillin-susceptible strains and 0. 125 and 0. 5 microgram/ml, respectively, for penicillin-intermediate strains. The MIC 50 s and MIC 90 s of cefotaxime for penicillin-resistant strains were 1. 0 and 2. 0 micrograms/ml, respectively, and those of <b>cefpirome</b> were 0. 5 and 1. 0 microgram/ml, respectively. All pneumococci were inhibited by <b>cefpirome</b> at MICs of 0. 5 to 1. 0. No FIC indices indicating antagonism (> 4. 0) were found. Synergy between beta-lactams and glycopeptides for three susceptible, three intermediate, and three resistant strains were tested by the time-kill assay, and all combinations were synergistic by this method. Synergy between cephalosporins and glycopeptides can be demonstrated and may be useful for the treatment of pneumococcal infections, especially meningitis...|$|E
40|$|E 1077 {{is a new}} {{injectable}} cephalosporin with a {{broad spectrum}} of antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The in vitro activities of E 1077 against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC of E 1077 for 90 % of the strains tested [MIC 90], 0. 78 microgram/ml) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MIC 90, 50 micrograms/ml) were similar to those of <b>cefpirome</b> and flomoxef. Against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC 90, 6. 25 micrograms/ml), E 1077 was the most active of the drugs tested and four times more active than <b>cefpirome.</b> The MIC 90 S of E 1077 for streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae ranged from 0. 05 to 0. 78 microgram/ml; E 1077 was similar in activity to <b>cefpirome.</b> E 1077 inhibited 90 % of most species of the family Enterobacteriaceae at concentrations of {{less than or equal to}} 1. 56 micrograms/ml, with the exception of Serratia marcescens and Proteus vulgaris (12. 5 micrograms/ml). The activity of E 1077 against P. aeruginosa (MIC 90, 6. 25 micrograms/ml) was comparable to that of ceftazidime. In vivo activity was evaluated with systemic infections in mice. E 1077 showed a protective effect against systemic infections by gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria, as reflected by its in vitro activity. The protective effects of E 1077 were higher than those of <b>cefpirome</b> against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa infections and similar to those of <b>cefpirome</b> against other bacterial infections. Morphological studies using differential interference and phase-contrast microscopy showed that low concentrations of E 1077 caused swelling of S. aureus and spheroplast and bulge formation in P. aeruginosa.
