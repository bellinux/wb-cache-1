40|$|SummaryBackground Xuefu Zhuyu Capsule (XFZY) {{has been}} {{commonly}} used for relieving chest pain {{in patients with}} coronary heart disease (CHD). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on XFZY in treating unstable angina (UA) have not been systematically reviewed. Objective This study aims to provide a PRISMA-compliant systematic review to evaluate the efficacy of XFZY in treating UA. Methods An extensive search of 7 medical databases was performed up to June 2013. RCTs involving XFZY or combined with <b>conventional</b> <b>drugs</b> versus <b>conventional</b> <b>drugs</b> were identified. Meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the cardiovascular effects of XFZY. Rev Man 5. 0 was used for data analysis. Results 8 RCTs were included in this review. Statistical analysis of {{the results showed that}} XFZY combined with <b>conventional</b> <b>drugs</b> had significant effect on relieving angina symptoms (RR: 1. 26 [1. 16, 1. 38]; P< 0. 00001) and improving ECG (RR: 1. 20 [1. 04, 1. 38]; P= 0. 01) compared with <b>conventional</b> <b>drugs</b> alone. No severe adverse events were reported. Conclusions XFZY combined with <b>conventional</b> <b>drugs</b> appears to have potential cardiovascular effects in treatment of UA with few adverse events. However, further rigorous designed trials are still needed...|$|R
50|$|Herb-drug {{interactions}} are drug interactions that occur between herbal medicines and <b>conventional</b> <b>drugs.</b> These types of interactions {{may be more}} common than drug-drug interactions because herbal medicines often contain multiple pharmacologically active ingredients, while <b>conventional</b> <b>drugs</b> typically contain only one. Some such {{interactions are}} clinically significant, although most herbal remedies are not associated with drug interactions causing serious consequences. Most herb-drug interactions are moderate in severity. The most commonly implicated <b>conventional</b> <b>drugs</b> in herb-drug interactions are warfarin, insulin, aspirin, digoxin, and ticlopidine, due to their narrow therapeutic indices. The most commonly implicated herbs involved in such interactions are those containing St. John’s Wort, magnesium, calcium, iron, or ginkgo.|$|R
40|$|We {{systematically}} {{assess the}} current clinical evidence of Gualouxiebaibanxia (GLXBBX) decoction {{for the treatment}} of angina pectoris (AP). We included RCTs testing GLXBBX against <b>conventional</b> <b>drugs</b> and GLXBBX combined with <b>conventional</b> <b>drugs</b> versus <b>conventional</b> <b>drugs.</b> 19 RCTs involving 1730 patients were finally identified, and the methodological quality was evaluated as generally low. The results of the meta-analysis showed that GLXBBX alone had significant effect on improving angina symptoms (RR: 1. 24, 95 % CI 1. 14 to 1. 35; P< 0. 00001), ECG (RR: 1. 28 [1. 13, 1. 44]; P< 0. 0001), and HDL-C (MD: 0. 56 [0. 54, 0. 58]; P< 0. 00001) compared with anti-arrhythmic drugs. A significant improvement in angina symptoms (RR: 1. 17 [1. 12, 1. 22]; P< 0. 00001) and ECG (RR = 1. 22; 95 % CI = [1. 14, 1. 30]; P< 0. 00001) was observed for GLXBBX plus <b>conventional</b> <b>drugs</b> when compared with <b>conventional</b> <b>drugs.</b> Eight trials reported adverse events without serious adverse effects. GLXBBX appears to have beneficial effects on improvement of ECG and reduction of angina symptoms in participants with AP. However, the evidence remains weak due to the poor methodological quality of the included studies. More rigorous trials are needed to confirm the results...|$|R
50|$|Targeted drug delivery, {{sometimes}} called smart drug delivery, {{is a method}} of delivering medication to a patient {{in a manner that}} increases the concentration of the medication {{in some parts of the}} body relative to others. This means of delivery is largely founded on nanomedicine, which plans to employ nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery in order to combat the downfalls of <b>conventional</b> <b>drug</b> delivery. These nanoparticles would be loaded with drugs and targeted to specific parts of the body where there is solely diseased tissue, thereby avoiding interaction with healthy tissue. The goal of a targeted drug delivery system is to prolong, localize, target and have a protected drug interaction with the diseased tissue. The <b>conventional</b> <b>drug</b> delivery system is the absorption of the drug across a biological membrane, whereas the targeted release system releases the drug in a dosage form. The advantages to the targeted release system is the reduction in the frequency of the dosages taken by the patient, having a more uniform effect of the drug, reduction of drug side-effects, and reduced fluctuation in circulating drug levels. The disadvantage of the system is high cost, which makes productivity more difficult and the reduced ability to adjust the dosages.|$|E
50|$|By {{utilizing}} both {{passive and}} active targeting, a drug-loaded nanoparticle has a heightened advantage over a <b>conventional</b> <b>drug.</b> It {{is able to}} circulate throughout the body {{for an extended period}} of time until it is successfully attracted to its target through the use of cell-specific ligands, magnetic positioning, or pH responsive materials. Because of these advantages, side effects from conventional drugs will be largely reduced as a result of the drug-loaded nanoparticles affecting only diseased tissue. However, an emerging field known as nanotoxicology has concerns that the nanoparticles themselves could pose a threat to both the environment and human health with side effects of their own. Active targeting can be also be achieved through peptide based drug targeting system.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{discuss the}} types of control groups in {{randomized}} controlled trials (RCTs) of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), and to provide suggestions for improving the design of control group in future clinical studies in this therapeutic area. Methods: A search of the Cochrane Library was conducted in July 2005 to identify RCTs of CHM, and 66 RCTs with CHM for type 2 diabetes mellitus were obtained {{as the basis for}} further analysis. Results: Of 66 RCTs with CHM for type 2 diabetes mellitus, 61 (92. 4 %) trials had both a treatment group and a control group. Twenty-seven (40. 9 %) RCTs compared CHM plus <b>conventional</b> <b>drug</b> vs <b>conventional</b> <b>drug,</b> 24 (36. 4 %) compared CHM vs <b>conventional</b> <b>drug,</b> 5 (7. 6 %) compared CHM vs placebo, 3 (4. 5 %) compared CHM plus <b>conventional</b> <b>drug</b> vs <b>conventional</b> <b>drug</b> plus placebo, 3 (4. 5 %) compared CHM plus <b>conventional</b> <b>drug</b> vs other CHM, 1 (1. 5 %) compared CHM vs no treatment, 1 (1. 5 %) compared CHM plus placebo vs <b>conventional</b> <b>drug</b> plus placebo, 1 (1. 5 %) compared CHM vs CHM plus <b>conventional</b> <b>drug</b> vs <b>conventional</b> <b>drug</b> vs placebo, and 1 (1. 5 %) compared CHM vs <b>conventional</b> <b>drug</b> vs CHM plus <b>conventional</b> <b>drug.</b> Conclusion: A variety of control groups were used in RCTs of CHM for type 2 diabetes mellitus, including placebo, active, and no treatment control groups. Justification for selecting particular types of control groups were not provided in the trials reviewed in this study. Different control groups may be appropriate according to the study objectives, and several factors should be considered prior to selecting control groups in future RCTs of CHM. Recommendations: (1) Investigators of CHM who design clinical trials should understand the rationale for selecting different types of control groups; (2) Control groups for RCTs should be selected according to study objectives; (3) Active control groups should select interventions for comparisons that have the strongest evidence of efficacy and prescribe them as recommended; (4) Placebo control groups should select a placebo that mimics the physical characteristics of test intervention as closely as possible and is completely inert; (5) No treatment control groups should only be used when withholding treatment is ethical and objectives outcomes will not be subject to bias due to absent blinding; (6) Crossover control groups may be appropriate in chronic and stable conditions...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{increased}} use of Chinese herbal products (CHPs) worldwide has raised the concern of herb–drug interactions. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the prevalence and utilization patterns of concurrent use of conventional drugs and CHPs in Taiwan. The usage and frequency of services in the co-prescription of a CHP and a <b>conventional</b> <b>drug</b> were evaluated. Subjects were recruited from a simple random sample of 1, 000, 000 subjects from over 22 million beneficiaries of the National Health Insurance in 2007. The logistic regression method was employed to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) for the co-prescription of a CHP and a <b>conventional</b> <b>drug</b> (CH+D) and a <b>conventional</b> <b>drug</b> alone (D-alone). The prevalence of the CH+D was 14. 1 %. Females, regular salary earners, and elderly (65 years and above) were more likely to consume a CHP and a <b>conventional</b> <b>drug</b> concurrently. Painkillers, especially acetaminophen, and anti-cough medicines were the top two conventional drugs that were most frequently co-prescribed with a CHP. Anti-cough medication is the most common <b>conventional</b> <b>drug</b> co-prescribed with CHP, after painkillers. We recommend that safety issues be investigated in future research and integrating both healthcare technologies may be beneficial for the overall health and quality of life of patients...|$|E

MethodsRandomized controlled trials (RCTs) concerned with acupuncture treatment of angina pectoris were identified by searching Academic Source Premier, MEDLINE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and three Chinese databases (China biology medicine database, China national knowledge infrastructure, and VIP database for Chinese technical periodicals). The valid data were extracted in accordance with our inclusion and exclusion criteria. The main outcomes of the included studies were synthesized using Revman 5. 1. ResultsTwenty-one articles on 16 individual studies were included and evaluated as having high or moderate risk of bias according {{to the standards of}} the Cochrane Collaboration. Meta-analysis indicated that acupuncture combined with <b>conventional</b> <b>drugs</b> (ACCD) was superior to <b>conventional</b> <b>drugs</b> alone in reducing the incidence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) [OR= 0. 18, 95 % CI (0. 04, 0. 84), P= 0. 03]. Moreover, ACCD was superior to <b>conventional</b> <b>drugs</b> in the relief of angina symptoms [OR= 4. 23, 95 % CI (2. 73, 6. 56), P< 0. 00001], and improvement of electrocardiography (ECG) [OR= 2. 61, 95 % CI (1. 83, 3. 73), P< 0. 00001]. Acupuncture by itself was also superior to <b>conventional</b> <b>drugs</b> for angina symptoms [OR= 3. 59, 95 %C/(1. 76, 7. 92), P= 0. 0004] and ECG improvement [OR= 3. 07, 95 %CI (1. 54, 6. 10), P= 0. 001]. ACCD was superior to <b>conventional</b> <b>drugs</b> in shortening the time to onset of angina relief [WMD=− 1. 40, 95 % CI (− 1. 65, − 1. 15), P< 0. 00001].

40|$|Abstract Background Knee {{osteoarthritis}} is a {{major cause}} of pain and functional limitation. Complementary and alternative medical approaches have been employed to relieve symptoms and to avoid the side effects of conventional medication. Moxibustion has been widely used to treat patients with knee osteoarthritis. Our past researches suggested heat-sensitive moxibustion might be superior to the conventional moxibustion. Our objective is to investigate the effectiveness of heat-sensitive moxibustion compared with conventional moxibustion or <b>conventional</b> <b>drug</b> treatment. Methods This study consists of a multi-centre (four centers in China), randomised, controlled trial with three parallel arms (A: heat-sensitive moxibustion; B: conventional moxibustion; C: <b>conventional</b> <b>drug</b> group). The moxibustion locations are different from A and B. Group A selects heat-sensitization acupoint from the region consisting of Yin Lingquan(SP 9), Yang Lingquan(GB 34), Liang Qiu(ST 34), and Xue Hai (SP 10). Meanwhile, fixed acupoints are used in group B, that is Xi Yan (EX-LE 5) and He Ding (EX-LE 2). The <b>conventional</b> <b>drug</b> group treats with intra-articular Sodium Hyaluronate injection. The outcome measures above will be assessed before the treatment, the 30 days of the last moxibustion session and 6 months after the last moxibustion session. Discussion This trial will utilize high quality trial methodologies in accordance with CONSORT guidelines. It will provide evidence for the effectiveness of moxibustion as a treatment for moderate and severe knee osteoarthritis. Moreover, the result will clarify the rules of heat-sensitive moxibustion location to improve the therapeutic effect with suspended moxibustion, and propose a new concept and a new theory of moxibustion to guide clinical practices.
