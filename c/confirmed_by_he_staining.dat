40|$|Background: The {{outcome of}} cytoreductive surgery in {{patients}} with peritoneal carcinomatosis is influenced by incomplete resection {{as a result of}} inadequate detection of a tumor, i. e. residual disease. The future perspective of complete resection, made possible by application of intraoperative near-infrared fluorescence imaging (NIRF), led to the development and validation of a bioluminescent colorectal peritoneal carcinomatosis xenograft rat model to act as the gold standard for the evaluation of new optical imaging modalities. Methods: Twenty nude rats were inoculated intraperitoneally with 2 x 10 (6) luciferase-labeled human colorectal tumor cells (HT- 29 -luc-D 6). The peritoneal carcinomatosis index (PCI) was estimated using visual observation (PCI-VO) and VO combined with bioluminescence imaging (PCI-BLI). Subsequently, the BL images were presented, and residual tumor tissue was localized by PCI-BLI scoring and compared with the PCI-VO. Results: BLI revealed additional tumor tissue, <b>confirmed</b> <b>by</b> <b>HE</b> <b>staining,</b> compared to VO alone in 7 out of 8 rats (p < 0. 02). Conclusion: The developed model turned out to be suitable. The use of BLI for tumor detection was more sensitive compared to VO alone. In this model, BLI significantly detected residual disease, and therefore, BLI can be denominated as the gold standard for the evaluation of optical imaging modalities like NIRF.

40|$|Abstract Background It is {{not clear}} if {{sentinel}} lymph node (SLN) mapping can improve outcomes in patients with colorectal cancers. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the prognostic values of ex vivo sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping and immunohistochemical (IHC) detection of SLN micrometastasis in colorectal cancers. Methods Colorectal cancer specimens were obtained during radical resections and the SLN was identified by injecting a 1 % isosulfan blue solution submucosally and circumferentially around the tumor within 30 [*]min after surgery. The first node to stain blue was defined as the SLN. SLNs negative by hematoxylin and eosin (<b>HE)</b> <b>staining</b> were further examined for micrometastasis using cytokeratin IHC. Results A total of 54 patients between 25 and 82 [*]years of age were enrolled, including 32 males and 22 females. More than 70 % of patients were T 3 or above, about 86 % of patients were stage II or III, and approximately 90 % of patients had lesions grade II or above. Sentinel lymph nodes were detected in all 54 patients. There were 32 patients in whom no lymph node micrometastasis were detected <b>by</b> <b>HE</b> <b>staining</b> and 22 patients with positive lymph nodes micrometastasis detected <b>by</b> <b>HE</b> <b>staining</b> in non-SLNs. In contrast only 7 SLNs <b>stained</b> positive with <b>HE.</b> Using HE examination as the standard, the sensitivity, non-detection rate, and accuracy rate of SLN micrometastasis detection were 31. 8 % (7 / 22), 68. 2 % (15 / 22), and 72. 2 %, respectively. Micrometastasis were identified by ICH in 4 of the 32 patients with HE-negative stained lymph nodes, resulting in an upstaging rate 12. 5 % (4 / 32). The 4 patients who were upstaged consisted of 2 stage I patients and 2 stage II patients who were upstaged to stage III. Those without lymph node metastasis <b>by</b> <b>HE</b> <b>staining</b> who were upstaged by IHC detection of micrometastasis had a significantly poorer disease-free survival (p[*]=[*] 0. 001) and overall survival (p[*]=[*] 0. 004). Conclusion Ex vivo localization and immunohistochemical detection of sentinel lymph node micrometastasis in patients with colorectal cancer can upgrade tumor staging, and may become a factor affecting prognosis and guiding treatment.

40|$|Abstract. Para-aortic {{lymph node}} (PALN) {{metastasis}} {{is widely regarded}} as a systemic disease in cancer. Undetected PALN micrometastases during routine hematoxylin and eosin (<b>HE)</b> <b>staining</b> may be a cause of poor prognosis following a potentially curative pancreatectomy for pancreatic cancer. In the present study, paraffin‑embedded PALN tissue blocks from 99 patients who underwent a pancreatectomy were re-evaluated by immunohistochemical staining using cytokeratin (CK) ‑ 19. Patients with PALN metastasis were summarized according to the clinicopathological data. A total of 484 PALNs (median, 4. 9 nodes per patient; range, 1 - 19) were evaluated. PALN metastases were revealed in eight patients (8. 1 %) <b>by</b> routine <b>HE</b> <b>staining</b> of frozen section biopsies and in one patient (1. 0 %) <b>by</b> <b>HE</b> <b>staining</b> of a permanent section. Only one patient (1. 0 %) demonstrated micrometastasis by IHC; this patient did not display any adverse pathological characteristics and had a relatively favorable survival period of 41 months. The present study concluded that an additional reassessment for microme-tastasis in PALNs using CK‑ 19 immunohistochemistry (IHC) is not a viable method for determining the survival outcome. A careful examination of a frozen section biopsy is sufficient for attempting curative surgery...|$|R

Osteonecrosis was induced by lipopolysaccharide(LPS) combined with methylprednisolone(MPS). The prevention group received an intraperitoneal injection of EDHB at 50 mg/kg body weight every other day starting three days before establishing rabbit models of osteonecrosis, for a total of nine doses. Osteonecrosis was verified <b>by</b> haematoxylin-eosin (<b>HE)</b> <b>staining.</b> The expression of HIF- 1 a and VEGF was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Angiogenesis, apoptosis and microstructural parameters were also analyzed. The rabbit models of osteonecrosis were successfully established and observed <b>by</b> <b>HE</b> <b>staining.</b> Histopathological observations indicated that EDHB reduced the rate of empty lacunae and the incidence of osteonecrosis. Immunohistochemical staining for HIF- 1 a and VEGF suggested that EDHB therapy inhibited degradation of HIF- 1 a and promoted expression of VEGF.

A chronic glaucoma model {{was established in}} rats, accordingly. The morphological changes in ocular tissues were analyzed <b>by</b> <b>HE</b> <b>staining.</b> Retinal ganglion cells apoptosis were analyzed by TUNEL staining. The protein expressions of Bcl- 2, Bax, Cleaved caspase- 3 and Cleaved caspase- 9 were determined by Western blot. The mRNA levels of Bcl- 2 and Bax were determined <b>by</b> qPCR. RESULTS: <b>HE</b> <b>staining</b> revealed that RSCs transplantation or GKB treatment decreased fiber interstitial edema and vacuole, as compared to glaucoma group. Furthermore, this improvement was more pronounced in combination therapy group than in single treatment alone. Combination therapy significantly inhibited retinal ganglion cells apoptosis, increased Bcl- 2 mRNA and protein expression,but decreased Bax mRNA and protein expression. Moreover, the protein expression of Cleaved caspase- 3 and Cleaved caspase- 9 expression were decreased after combination therapy. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that combination of Ginkgobalide B and retinal stem cells transplantation can inhibit retinal ganglion cells apoptosis and protect against glaucoma.

However, this technique requires large fragments for a better diagnosis. Additionally, the histochemical and immunohistochemical methods of staining small fragments of rectal mucosal and submucosal biopsies are not available in all centers. Therefore, the possibility of diagnosing HD through <b>HE</b> <b>staining</b> in these biopsies could be a valuable alternative for centers {{that do not have}} more specific techniques. The objectives of the current investigation were to evaluate the concordance of the results obtained <b>by</b> <b>HE</b> <b>staining</b> and the calretinin method with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in fragments of mucosa and submucosa in the diagnosis of HD.

In the cerebellar neocortex of an acute case of hypoglycemia, the P 400 /InsP 3 R staining of hypoglycemic Purkinje cells was heterogeneous: some peripheral dendrites, including spiny branchlets, were negative and others were stained with various intensities, although Purkinje cells were morphologically intact by hematoxylin and eosin (<b>HE)</b> <b>stain.</b> In a chronic case of hypoglycemia, almost all the dendrites of Purkinje cells of both the neo- and archicortex of the cerebellum were not stained with the P 400 / InsP 3 R antibody. This is in contrast to the normal dog where Purkinje cell bodies, axons, and dendrites, including spiny branchlets, are intensely stained by the P 400 /InsP 3 R antibody.

The pathology of liver was observed <b>by</b> <b>HE</b> <b>staining.</b> RESULTS: At end of the 8 th wk, there was no marked difference in the levels of endotoxin, D-xylose and sIgA between the two groups. At end of the 12 th wk, rats in the model group developed steatohepatitis and had a higher serum level of endotoxin (P = 0. 01) and D-xylose (P = 0. 00) and a lower serum level of sIgA (P = 0. 007). CONCLUSION: Intestinal mucosa barrier malfunction may exist in NASH rats and may be an important promoter of NASH in rats...|$|R
40|$|BA is {{the most}} {{important}} disease requiring liver transplantation in children. Common BDL in rats is a classic experimental model to study biliary obstruction. The response of the neonatal animal to BDL has yet to be completely understood and few reports have focused on the behavioral differences of the liver between neonatal and adult animals. Ninety newborn Wistar rats aged six days, weighing 8. 0 - 13. 9 g, and 90 adult Wistar rats weighing 199. 7 - 357. 0 g, were submitted to BDL. After surgery, they were randomly divided and killed on the 3 rd, 5 th, 7 th, 14 th, 21 st and 28 th day post-BDL. Hepatic biopsies were obtained and the following were measured: (i) semiquantification of the bile ductule proliferation and inflammatory infiltrate <b>by</b> <b>HE</b> <b>stain,</b> (ii) quanti. cation of portal and periportal fibrosis with the Sirius-red stain. Although the initial response of ductule proliferation and inflammatory infiltrate were less intense in the newborn animal, the portal and periportal fibrosis were higher when compared with adult animals (p < 0. 0491). These findings may contribute {{to the understanding of the}} pathophysiology of BA. FAPESP[2007 / 01333 - 2...|$|R
