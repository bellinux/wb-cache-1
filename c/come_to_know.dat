For my part, I {{do not believe that the}} German soldier as such has lost his honor. The fact that certain individuals committed in war dishonorable and despicable acts reflects on the individuals concerned and not on the great majority of German soldiers and officers.|$|E

5|$|The {{scientific}} and technological impact of extraterrestrial contact through electromagnetic waves would probably be quite small, especially at first. However, if the message contains {{a large amount of}} information, deciphering it could give humans access to a galactic heritage perhaps predating the human species itself, which may greatly advance our technology and science. A possible negative effect could be to demoralize research scientists as they <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that what they are researching may already be known to another civilization.|$|E

5|$|Clement {{argues for}} the {{equality}} of sexes, {{on the grounds that}} salvation is extended to all of mankind equally. Unusually, he suggests that Christ is neither male or female, and that God the Father has both male and female aspects: the eucharist is described as milk from the breast (Christ) of the Father. He is supportive of women playing {{an active role in the}} leadership of the church, and provides a list of women he considers inspirational, which includes both Biblical and Classical Greek figures. It has been suggested that Clement's progressive views on gender as set out in the Paedagogus were influenced by Gnosticism. However, later in the work, he argues against the Gnostics that faith, not esoteric knowledge , is required for salvation. According to Clement, it is through faith in Christ that we are enlightened and <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> God.|$|E

50|$|The film borrows {{heavily from}} Yash Chopra's classic movie Trishul with Amitabh Bachchan. Jackie Shroff, Rajinikanth and Kulbhushan Kharbanda play the {{respective}} roles of Amitabh Bachchan, Shashi Kapoor and Sanjeev Kumar in Trishul. Subhash Ghai has assisted in filming this. At {{the time of}} his mother's death, Raja <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that his father is still alive and living a wealthy life. Raja now befriends Shankran, his step-brother and steals his girlfriend Chanda (played by Madhuri Dixit). He also fraudulently takes signatures of Shankran on certain property papers. However, Shankran's mother is a very intelligent lady and catches Raja red-handed. However, she does not hand him over the police when she <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that he is her step son. Meanwhile, Shankran is unable to handle Chanda's rejection and is in grief. However, he too excuses Raja after he <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that he is his step brother. Meanwhile, their father Krishnakant (played by Kulbhushan Kharbanda) returns from abroad and when he <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about this, he is very upset. He is about to take action against Raja but excuses him after he <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that he is his elder son. All's well that ends well.|$|R

5|$|Smith {{was born}} as Frank Wenham in Tonbridge, Kent, on 9 June 1885. He was the illegitimate son of Oswald Cox, {{a member of}} a {{prominent}} local family who resided at Marl Field House, and one of his domestic servants, Minnie Wenham, whom Frank would never <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> Considered an embarrassment by the wealthy Cox family, from an early age he was sent away to live with relatives, and aged four sent to a boarding school where he was physically abused by staff before being removed from the institution by his paternal grandmother, who took him for a year in Switzerland. From 1899 to 1901, he studied at Bedales School, where he developed his lifelong hobby of book binding, before becoming the apprentice to a cabinet maker in Kendal until 1906.|$|E
5|$|The fifth book {{returns to}} the subject of faith. Clement argues that truth, justice and {{goodness}} can be seen only by the mind, not the eye; faith is a way of accessing the unseeable. He stresses that knowledge of God can only be achieved through faith once one's moral faults have been corrected. This parallels Clement's earlier insistence that martyrdom can only be achieved by those who practice their faith in Christ through good deeds, not those who simply profess their faith. God transcends matter entirely, and thus the materialist cannot truly <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> God. Although Christ was God incarnate, it is our spiritual, not physical comprehension of him which is important.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} where The Immortals of Meluha ended. Shiva, the fabled {{savior of the}} land of Meluha, rushes to save his wife Sati from the Naga, the {{supposed}} killer of Shiva's friend Brahaspati. The Naga escapes, leaving behind coins with strange engravings. After consulting with Sati's father Daksha and Dilipa, the king of Ayodhya, they <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that the coin belongs to King Chandraketu, the ruler {{of the land of}} Branga in eastern India. Shiva and Sati travel to Kashi, where a community of Brangas inhabit, in order to get more information on the Nagas. They are accompanied in their journey by Shiva's General Parvateshwar, his associates Nandi and Veerbhadra, Ayurvati the doctor, and Bhagirath and Anandamayi, the prince and princess of Ayodhya. At Kashi, Parvateshwar gets mortally injured while trying to pacify a riot at the Branga community. The Branga leader Divodas administers a medicine on Parvateshwar; it works and the General is healed, but Shiva comes to know from Ayurvati that it contains herbs which is only available at Panchavati, the capital of the Nagas. He consults with Divodas and comes to know that Branga suffers from a mortal plague, which has led them to ally with the Nagas, in return for benefits. Shiva decides to travel to Branga but Divodas informs him that to reach there special ships need to be made, which would take about six months.|$|E

25|$|The incomprehensible God {{is known}} through Christ, by faith, {{rather than by}} {{philosophical}} speculations. He manifests God to us, being the expression of His very being, and through him alone, God can be known.

25|$|According to constructivists, {{the world}} is {{independent}} of human minds, but knowledge of {{the world is}} always a human and social construction.

25|$|The ancient Greek {{philosophers}} took {{such questions}} very seriously. Indeed, {{many of their}} general philosophical discussions were carried on with extensive reference to geometry and arithmetic. Plato (424/423BC 348/347BC) insisted that mathematical objects, like other platonic Ideas (forms or essences), must be perfectly abstract and have a separate, non-material kind of existence, {{in a world of}} mathematical objects independent of humans. He believed that the truths about these objects also exist independently of the human mind, but is discovered by humans. In the Meno Plato's teacher Socrates asserts {{that it is possible to}} <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> this truth by a process akin to memory retrieval.|$|E

25|$|Kept {{a closely}} guarded secret for many years, in 2017 Brokaw wrote {{of having been}} offered – and having {{promptly}} turned down – the press secretary position in the Nixon White House in 1969. Brokaw had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> members of the Nixon team, including most particularly H. R.

25|$|Eventually Edmund, Lucy, Eustace, and Reepicheep {{the mouse}} reach the world's end, where Aslan {{appears as a}} lamb before {{transforming}} into a lion (a scene that refers to John 21:12, where Jesus appears after his resurrection and makes a breakfast of fish for his disciples). He shows Reepicheep {{the way to his}} country and helps the children return home. He tells Edmund and Lucy that, like Peter and Susan, they have become too old to return to Narnia, and that they must instead <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> him in their world—a relatively direct reference to the Christian theme of the series. He does not say whether Eustace will return to Narnia.|$|E
25|$|Everything {{that has}} {{happened}} since has therefore been planned by God to help humanity overcome this initial mishap and achieve spiritual maturity. The world has been intentionally designed by God as a difficult place, where human beings are forced to make moral decisions, as only in this way can they mature as moral agents. Irenaeus likens death to the big fish that swallowed Jonah: {{it was only in}} the depths of the whale's belly that Jonah could turn to God and act according to the divine will. Similarly, death and suffering appear as evils, but without them we could never <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> God.|$|E
