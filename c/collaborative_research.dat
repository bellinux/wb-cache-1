5|$|Thanks to the HDF, {{the ongoing}} US-Venezuela Huntington's Disease <b>Collaborative</b> <b>Research</b> Project {{was started in}} 1979, and {{reported}} a major breakthrough in 1983 {{with the discovery of}} the approximate location of a causal gene. This was the result of an extensive study focusing on the populations of two isolated Venezuelan villages, Barranquitas and Lagunetas, where there was an unusually high prevalence of the disease. It involved over 18,000 people—mostly from a single extended family.|$|E
5|$|The {{search for}} the cause of this {{condition}} was enhanced considerably in 1968, when the Hereditary Disease Foundation (HDF) was created by Milton Wexler, a psychoanalyst based in Los Angeles, California, whose wife Leonore Sabin had been diagnosed earlier that year with Huntington's disease. The three brothers of Wexler's wife also suffered from this disease. The foundation was involved in the recruitment of over 100 scientists in the Huntington's Disease <b>Collaborative</b> <b>Research</b> Project who over a 10-year period worked to locate the responsible gene.|$|E
