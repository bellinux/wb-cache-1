As the Army sought to open a local base at the site of McCarran Field, Clark County purchased Alamo Field from Crockett in order to relocate <b>commercial</b> <b>air</b> <b>traffic.</b> Alamo Field became the new McCarran Field on December 19, 1948. The opening of this new airfield broke Western Air Express' monopoly on flights to Las Vegas, allowing other airlines to serve the market.

40|$|Although {{there are}} {{hundreds}} of airports that support <b>commercial</b> <b>air</b> passenger <b>traffic</b> in the United States (US), not all areas are equivalently served by the <b>commercial</b> <b>air</b> transportation system. Locations in the US differ with respect to their level of access to the <b>commercial</b> <b>air</b> network and their overall accessibility within the system. Given the complexity of the domestic <b>commercial</b> <b>air</b> passenger network and supporting infrastructure, past research has only been able to provide a limited assessment of locational accessibility within the United States. To address these complexities, this paper proposes a new metric that incorporates measures of access to air transport as well as accessibility within air transportation networks. Using a comprehensive dataset on scheduled airline service, the developed approach is then applied to the US domestic <b>commercial</b> passenger <b>air</b> transportation network to explore geographic differentials in accessibility.

40|$|System wide {{information}} management (SWIM) – as {{envisioned by the}} Single European Sky <b>Air</b> <b>Traffic</b> Management Research (SESAR) program – is the application of service oriented architectures to the <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> management domain. Service oriented architectures are widely deployed in business and finance but usually tied to one specific technological implementation. SWIM goes one step further by defining only the semantic layer of the application integration and leaving {{the implementation of the}} communication layer open to the implementer. The shift from legacy communication patterns to SWIM is fundamental for the expected evolution of <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> management in the next decades. However, the <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> management simulators currently in use do not reflect this, yet. SWIM compliance is defined by semantic compatibility to the <b>Air</b> <b>traffic</b> management Information Reference Model (AIRM) and a SWIM service may implement one or more communication profiles, which specify a communication layer implementation. This work proposes a SWIM-compliant communication profile suitable to integrate SWIM-compliant tools into human-in-the-loop simulations for <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> management research. We achieve this objective by implementing a SWIM communication profile using XML-based multicast messaging, and extending the message format to support distributed human-in-the-loop simulations.

This proposal would introduce cost-based charges for <b>commercial</b> users of <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control services, eliminate many current taxes, substantially raise fuel taxes for general aviation users to pay for their use of <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control services, and charge commercial and general aviation users a fuel tax to pay primarily for airport capital improvements. In January 2007, FAA released the results of a recently completed cost allocation study in support of the administration's proposal for transitioning to user fees.

40|$|Description of the Proposed Action As {{a result}} of {{increased}} <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> flow into the Salt Lake City area, the Air Force proposes to modify the aircraft departure routes at Hill Air Force Base (AFB). The new departure routes would improve military readiness without increasing costs, while allowing for efficient management of increased <b>commercial</b> and military <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> within the Wasatch Front region. Military readiness would improve as {{a result of}} increased training opportunities due to reduced transit time to the Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR) and additional departure route flexibility. The efficiency of <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> management would improve {{as a result of}} increased separation between military and commercial aircraft. Increased aircraft separation would result in expedited releases from Hill AFB, reduced <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> controller workload, and increased capacity at the Salt Lake City International Airport (SLCIA). Four alternative actions were evaluated in this environmental assessment (EA). The Proposed Action would modify the current Devlin Departure route and add the south Wasatch Departure route. Alternative 1 would modify the current Devlin Departure route and would not add the Wasatch Departure route. Under Alternative 2, the current Devlin Departure route wold remain unchanged, but the Wasatch Departure route would be added. The No-Action Alternative would maintain the current Devlin Departure route. For each alternative, the maximum mission scenario was evaluated, i. e., approximately 127, 000 aircraft operations and all available aircraft parking spaces were assumed for the modeling effort.

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>traffic</b> control (ATC) radar {{has been}} the main sensor for the {{detection}} and monitoring of <b>commercial</b> aircrafts for <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> management. Typical modern ATC radar consists of a primary radar and secondary radar. The primary radar locates aircrafts based on the time-delay between the transmit pulses and the returns off the aircrafts. Since only location is provided, the secondary radar receives identification and flight parameters based on mode A, C or S by interrogating the transponder on board incoming aircrafts. Extensive use of radar is limited by high acquisition, installation and maintenance cost. Also, the coverage is limited by blockage due to obstacles such as buildings and mountains. Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) system is the next generation locating system to complement existing ATC radar system. The proposed project looks into the design of an optimum receiver to decode both ADS-B and mode S secondary radar signal.

40|$|Commercial {{space is}} {{expected}} to significantly {{reduce the cost of}} transporting people and payload into orbit. In addition to conventional launchers, novel launch concepts include suborbital aircraft, high altitude balloons or flying launch platforms. As a result, new mission profiles, usage concepts and an increased need for launch capacity are leading to a growing interest in expanding space activities and making their operation possible from locations all over the world. The dynamics of this process can be seen in an already rapidly growing number of <b>commercial</b> launches. <b>Air</b> <b>Traffic</b> Management (ATM) is challenged to integrate those vehicles in safe and efficient ways. The ATM integration concept must follow a common approach that can accommodate all different types of commercial spacecraft operations. Its goal must be to allow for a sustainable development of both, <b>commercial</b> <b>air</b> and space transportation. Therefore, harmonization and global interoperability is key, as it ensures seamless operation between systems, an accepted set of common technical and operational standards and minimized costs through identified synergies. This paper describes the necessary evolution of commercial space ATM integration towards a concept that is addressing as well interoperability issues between the aviation and space domains as between the ATM systems of different world regions. Based on an approach that accommodates key elements of the future Single European Sky (SES) and the US Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), its backbone is a dedicated CST service for the System Wide Information Management (SWIM). It is designed to facilitate on-time availability of required information to plan, monitor and accommodate space flights within the airspace system at all relevant stakeholder levels. The provision of adequate flight planning information and updates together with continuous surveillance data during all flight phases relevant for ATM is essential to enable the developed solution.
