5|$|Every year of its 17-year run on CBS, Lassie placed {{first in}} its time slot, Sunday 7:00 P.M. EST, and often {{ranked among the}} top 25 shows on television. The show's highest ranking years in the Nielsen ratings were the Martin years when the show placed #24 in 1957, #22 in 1958, #15 in 1959, #15 in 1961, #21 in 1962, #13 in 1963, and #17 in 1964. The only Martin year Lassie did not <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> top twenty-five was 1960, when it ran {{opposite}} Walt Disney Presents on ABC and Shirley Temple Theater on NBC. However, Lassie still ran opposite Disney when the Disney anthology television series moved to NBC in 1961, and still managed to <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Top 25. With {{the advent of the}} Forest Service seasons, the show began a steady decline in ratings.|$|E
5|$|Soaring {{related to}} wind shear, also called dynamic soaring, is a {{technique}} used by soaring birds like albatrosses, who can maintain flight without wing flapping. If the wind shear is of sufficient magnitude, a bird can <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wind gradient, trading ground speed for height, while maintaining airspeed. By then turning downwind, and diving through the wind gradient, they can also gain energy. It has also been used by glider pilots on rare occasions.|$|E
5|$|Feit {{initially}} denied hearing Garza's confession in the rectory, but {{he later}} {{admitted to having}} done so. He accounted for his absence from the sanctuary by explaining that he had broken his glasses that night; {{he said that he}} often played with his glasses nervously as he listened to confession. Feit said that he had driven back to the pastoral house to get another pair of glasses, and when he arrived he had no key, so he had to <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> house on the second floor. He said that he sustained the scratches on his hands as was climbing the outside of the brick structure.|$|E

5|$|The first-ever Queen of the Cage {{match for}} number one contendership to the TNA Women's Knockout Championship was next. The {{participants}} in the encounter were Angelina Love, Christy Hemme, Jackie Moore, Rhaka Khan, Roxxi Laveaux, Salinas, Traci Brooks, and Velvet Sky. In this match, the participants fought {{on the outside of}} the ring to <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cage. The first two to do so had a standard wrestling match, with the winner determined by pinfall or submission. It lasted 5 minutes and 30 seconds. Laveaux and Love were the first to enter the cage, with Laveaux gaining the pinfall after her signature Voodoo Drop maneuver to become the first-ever Queen of the Cage and become number one contender to the TNA Women's Knockout Championship.|$|E
5|$|The first {{lifeboat}} launched was Lifeboat 7 on {{the starboard}} side with 28 people on board out of a capacity of 65. It was lowered at around 12:45am as believed by the British Inquiry. Collapsible Boat D was the last lifeboat to be launched, at 2:05. Two more lifeboats, Collapsible Boats A and B, {{were in the process}} of being removed from their location on the roof of the officer's house but could not be properly launched. Collapsible B floated away from the ship upside down, while Collapsible A became half-filled with water after the supports for its canvas sides were broken in the fall from the roof of the officers' quarters. There were arguments in some of the lifeboats about going back to pick up people in the water, but many survivors were afraid of being swamped by people trying to <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lifeboat or being pulled down by the suction from the sinking Titanic, though it turned out that there had been very little suction. At 2:20am, Titanic herself sank. A small number of passengers and crew were able to make their way to the two unlaunched collapsible boats, surviving for several hours (some still clinging to the overturned Collapsible B) until they were rescued by Fifth Officer Harold Lowe.|$|E

25|$|Wind {{gradient}} soaring, {{also called}} dynamic soaring, {{is a technique}} used by soaring birds including albatrosses.

By then turning downwind, and diving through the wind gradient, they can also gain energy.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the city}} lies on land {{reclaimed}} from the Gulf of Paria, the calm sheltered bay separating Trinidad from Venezuela, while other parts <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hills above the city. Geographically, the Port of Port of Spain is ideal for maritime traffic, providing a natural harbour on Trinidad’s north-western coasts where adverse weather conditions are extremely rare.|$|E
25|$|From 2003, Sharapova {{played a}} full season and made a rapid <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> top 50 {{by the end of}} the year. She made her debuts at both the Australian Open and the French Open, but failed to win a match in either. Then, as a {{wildcard}} at Wimbledon, she defeated 11th seed Jelena Dokić, her first win over a top-20 player, to reach the fourth round, where she lost in three sets to Svetlana Kuznetsova.|$|E

25|$|The highest rankings in the Nielsen {{ratings for}} Lassie were the Martin family years: #24 in 1957, #22 in 1958, #15 in 1959, #15 in 1961, #21 in 1962, #13 in 1963, and #17 in 1964. The only year the show did not <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> top twenty-five was 1960, when it ran {{opposite}} Walt Disney Presents on ABC and Shirley Temple Theatre on NBC.

25|$|By {{the time}} they got to the beach, Kalaniʻōpuʻu's two {{youngest}} sons, who had been following their father believing they were being invited to visit the ship again with the ruler, began to <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> boats that were waiting at the shore. Kānekapōlei shouted to them {{to get out of the}} boat and pleaded with her husband to stop. The ruler then realized that Cook and his men were not asking him to visit the ship, but forcing him. At this point he stopped and sat down.|$|E
25|$|Things {{changed in}} early 2007, with new National leader John Key {{improving}} on Brash's preferred Prime Minister rating by ten points, and overtaking Clark as preferred Prime Minister in May; {{at the same}} time National jumped out to a sizeable lead over Labour ranging from between eight and eighteen points, spending most of 2007 and 2008 with support from around fifty percent of the electorate. Labour's popularity slumped, hitting its lowest point in the winter of 2008, before beginning a slow <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> high thirties in August and September.|$|E

25|$|On {{a trip to}} New York City, Rogers was at Madison Square Garden when a wild steer {{broke out}} of the arena and began to <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> viewing stands. Rogers roped the steer {{to the delight of}} the crowd. The feat got front page {{attention}} from the newspapers, giving him valuable publicity and an audience eager to see more. Willie Hammerstein saw his vaudeville act, and signed Rogers to appear on the Victoria Roof—which was literally on a rooftop—with his pony. For the next decade, Rogers estimated he worked for fifty weeks a year at the Roof and at the city's myriad vaudeville theaters.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} fictional Star Wars settings, several {{real-world}} filming locations {{have been used}} to create the Yavin Moon location. For the original 1977 film, Guatemala was chosen for second unit filming to create establishing shots for the Yavin base, and in March 1977, a crew led by Richard Edlund travelled to Guatemala. The exterior panoramic shots featuring the scenery of Yavin 4 were filmed overlooking the ancient Mayan pyramid complex of Tikal amid a dense rainforest. The Rebel outlook post was built from trash cans glued together and mounted on a pole; the special effects artist Lorne Peterson was persuaded to <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> precarious structure to pose in Rebel uniform for the shot.|$|E
25|$|It {{begins to}} <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hills east of this exit, passing through some rock {{cuts in the}} four miles (6km) to the Lime Kiln Road exit, which allows easy access to a nearby former IBM {{facility}} now known as Hudson Valley Research Park. From there it descends gently over two miles (3km), with Hosner Mountain looming to the east, to the sprawling interchange with the Taconic State Parkway. It ascends again afterwards, passing scenic overlooks on either side that allow views of the valley and the Catskills to the northwest. At the crest, near where the Appalachian Trail crosses over, signs indicate the road has once again reached 1,000 feet (305 m) in elevation.|$|E

25|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War II, the War Department took over the Stadium in 1940, where for a while POWs (Prisoners of War) were housed in huts placed on the pitch, for this the club received compensation of £4,570 in 1945. World War II affected Swindon Town more than most other football clubs and the club was almost disbanded, the club needed {{a large amount of}} time to recover and for this reason it failed to make any real impression in the league and would not <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> second division until 1963 when they finished runners up to Northampton Town. The club was relegated back into Division Three in 1965 but it was about to create a sensation.|$|E
25|$|Hoping to {{accomplish}} this, Martin Schenck devised a scheme {{through which he}} would take Nijmegen and enhance his own treasury. On the evening of 10nbsp&August 1589, Schenck and 20nbsp&barges of men—approximately 200nbsp&soldiers—made {{their way down the}} Waal to Nijmegen. Schenck's plan was simple: they would find a house with open windows. Using scaling hooks and ropes, they would <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> house and overpower the inhabitants, who should be sleeping at that hour. Once the house was secured, they would quietly find the city gate, and open it {{to the rest of the}} force, which would be waiting on the river landing. They could then overpower the small local garrison and any citizens who felt resistance was necessary. Not only would they reinforce the city, but there would be opportunity for plunder as well.|$|E
25|$|Franklin {{played his}} 250th game in round 3, kicking three behinds in a one-point loss to Collingwood at the SCG. Two weeks later, Franklin kicked his 800th career goal {{with the last}} of his three goals in the Swans' 42-point loss to Greater Western Sydney; this was Sydney's fifth of six-straight losses to start the season, which was their worst start to a season since 1993. The Swans' losing streak came to an end when Franklin kicked eight goals in a 54-point win against the Brisbane Lions in round 7. In round 10, for Indigenous Round, Franklin was among a number of players who wore the number 67 on their guernseys to commemorate the 1967 Australian {{referendum}} which recognised Indigenous Australians in the census. Franklin went on to kick five goals in the six-point loss to Hawthorn, overtaking Bernie Quinlan to <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> top ten highest goalkickers in VFL/AFL history.|$|E
