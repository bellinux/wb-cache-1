40|$|The name trawl {{is derived}} from the manner of {{operating}} the net rather than from any peculiarity of the net itself. The net is essentially a flattened bag which is towed or trawled over the ocean floor and this manner of fishing has shown itself to be very efficient in taking deep water fishes in large quantity at low operating cost. The capture of demersel fishes by means of hand lines, set or long lines and submerged gill or trammel nets requires more men, working longer hours for a smaller catch than does the dragging of a bag net along the ocean bottom. Another factor contributed to the success of trawling as a method of fishing. The dragging of a deeply submerged net could be continued after the weather became too rough to permit fishing operations by setliners or trammel netters. Trawling vessels averaged larger than set line boats and put to sea in weather that kept smaller <b>craft</b> <b>port</b> bound. Thus in spells of bad weather it frequently happened that no fish was delivered except the trawl-caught fares which benefited from any upward price fluctuation due to bad-weather scarcity of fish. However, trawling was not dependent upon favorable sale price. Quite the contrary, trawling was profitable at low price because of the quantity production at low operating cost. Consequently price to small-boat fishermen usually sagged when trawlers operated in an area. This pinched the small operators and often drove them into some other type of fishing. Although there are many variations in the construction of trawl nets, there are three basic types determined by the device employed to keep the mouth of the bag open. The simplest method is to attach the net to a rigid horizontal pole or beam. This is the beam trawl. Another method is to employ two towing lines, each line towed by a separate vessel. The two vessels follow parallel courses but at sufficient distance apart so that the diverging tow lines pull outward and keep the net mouth spread open. This is the two-boat or paranzella type. The outward pull on the net mouth may be accomplished by a pair of kite-like boards, one at each side of the net, so hung at an angle that the boards tend to diverge or kite outward which keeps the mouth of the net open. This is the otter trawl...|$|E

50|$|A {{highlight}} of Whidbey's {{first year in}} commission occurred shortly before Christmas of 1947. At 0945 on 22 December, the ship began doubling up all lines in anticipation of an approaching storm, while she was moored alongside the district oiler, YO-104, at Tomil Harbor, Yap Island; and at 1605 got underway for Guam, standing out to sea as the wind and sea began to rise menacingly. By 2200, the ship was maneuvering at various courses and speeds to keep headed into the wind; by 2330 the situation looked critical—all hands were ordered to don life jackets! Whidbey fought the sea into the next morning. At 0042, a fire {{broke out in the}} bilges. Shutting down the port main engine, the auxiliary's crew battled the small fire for only a short time before they succeeded in putting it out, while, topside, heavy seas carried away one of the snip's lifeboats.

By 0413, heavy waves were breaking over the port and starboard sides of the ship; changing course at that instant, Whidbey suddenly ground onto a reef at 0418. All hands manned their abandon ship stations to prepare for any eventuality should the ship have foundered; but soundings were taken, and it looked as if the ship was on an even keel and not taking any water.|$|R
