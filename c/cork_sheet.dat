50|$|Unlike tiles {{which are}} made of minerals, {{resilient}} flooring is made of materials that have some elasticity, giving the flooring a degree of flexibility called resilience. The flooring is available in large sheets or pre-cut tiles, and either comes with pre-applied adhesive for peel-and-stick installation or requires adhesive to be troweled on to the substrate. Resilient flooring includes many different manufactured products including linoleum, sheet vinyl, vinyl composition tile (VCT), <b>cork</b> (<b>sheet</b> or tile), and rubber. Performance surfaces used for dance or athletics are usually made of wood or resilient flooring.The two basic categories of vinyl floor tiles are solid vinyl and vinyl composition, and the three basic categories of vinyl sheet flooring are homogeneous, inlaid, and layered composite. These types of vinyl flooring differ in manufacturing process and content, ranging in vinyl (polyvinyl chloride) content from 11% to 55%.|$|E

5000|$|The Lignel 46 was {{the last}} {{aircraft}} produced by Société Française de Construction Aéronautique (SFCA). It was a cantilever low wing monoplane, seating four in two side-by-side rows under a multipart glazed canopy. [...] The two main transparencies opened {{away from each other}} on vertical, forward hinges for cabin access. There was a [...] Mathis G8R or Mathis G8 20 inverted V-8 engine, driving an automatic variable pitch propeller in the nose; behind the cabin the fuselage tapered linearly from the full cabin depth. The Lignel 46 was a wooden aircraft and its monocoque fuselage was built using a composite shell composed of perforated <b>cork</b> <b>sheets</b> between inner and outer shaped plywood layers, a method patented by Jean Broudeau and one that SFCA had explored before World War II.|$|R
40|$|Artículos en revistasCork {{is one of}} {{the finest}} natural {{materials}} with high acoustic insulation properties due to its porous structure. In addition, cork presents high water resistance due to its hydrophobic nature. In many applications, cork panels need to be bonded to other materials for manufacturing composite materials or agglomerated <b>cork</b> <b>sheets.</b> In this case, its lack of wettability becomes an important disadvantage. This paper aims to improve the wettability of cork by silanization, atmospheric plasma treatment, and vacuum plasma treatment. The processing conditions of the three treatments were optimized. The surface characterization was performed by surface energy, roughness, and attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy measurements. Pull-off adherence and peel tests were carried out to evaluate the performance of the treatments with an epoxy adhesive. Plasma treatment of cork plates could be a useful tool to enhance adhesion properties in the manufacturing process of cork sandwich panels or other applications where it could be joined to any material. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
5000|$|... 1995 was {{to prove}} another {{personal}} milestone in the football career of O'Leary. Dublin easily beat Meath in the Leinster final by 1-18 to 1-08 which {{paved the way}} for a semi final showdown with <b>Cork.</b> A clean <b>sheet</b> for O'Leary in the semi final gave Dublin the win over Cork with great performance by Mick Galvin and Jason Sherlock. Dublin finally managed to beat Ulster opposition in the all-Ireland phase of the championship by beating Tyrone by 1-10 to 0-12. This was Dublin and O'Learys first all-Ireland since 1983 and being captain made it all the more special for him. He was then awarded his fifth and final all-star award for his performance with Dublin, most notably clean sheets in the semi-final and the final at Croke Park.|$|R
40|$|The four {{solid rocket}} booster (SRB) {{hold-down}} posts are {{fastened to the}} mobile launch platform (MLP) with four large nuts. At liftoff the nuts are split with explosive changes to release the SRB/Shuttle. A blast container is placed over the nuts to protect the vehicle from flying debris. The blast container is a reusable part {{and has to be}} protected from aerodynamic heating during flight. The thermal protection system (TPS) used to protect these blast containers is cork. Fitting the flat <b>cork</b> <b>sheet</b> to this hemispherical shaped blast container is both time consuming and expensive. Another problem is removing the charred cork and epoxy glue from the blast containers. Replacements of this cork with another TPS material such as MTA- 2 was examined. Heating rates along the centerline of the forward facing areas of the blast container were determined. The feasibility of using 1 / 2 in. MTA- 2 on the SRB blast containers for protection from ascent, plume impingement and reentry heating is demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sheet</b> <b>cork</b> and cork filled epoxy provide {{external}} insulation for the Reusable Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM) on the Nation's Space Transportation System (STS). Interest in {{the reliability of}} the {{external insulation}} bonds has increased since the Columbia incident. A non-destructive test (NDT) method that will provide the best inspection for these bonds has been under evaluation. Electronic Shearography has been selected as the primary NDT method for inspection of these bond lines in the RSRM production flow. ATK Launch Systems Group has purchased an electronic shearography system that includes a vacuum chamber that is used for evaluation of test parts and custom vacuum windows for inspection of full-scale motors. Although the electronic shearography technology has been selected as the primary method for inspection of the external bonds, other technologies that exist continue to be investigated. The NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) NDT department has inspected several samples for comparison with electronic shearography with various inspections systems in their laboratory. The systems that were evaluated are X-ray backscatter, terahertz imaging, and microwave imaging. The samples tested have some programmed flaws as well as some flaws that occurred naturally during the sample making process. These samples provide sufficient flaw variation for the evaluation of the different inspection systems. This paper will describe and compare the basic functionality, test method and test results including dissection for each inspection technology...|$|R
