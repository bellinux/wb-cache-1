The proposed design is veri-fied using an 8 -bit, 3. 3 V, 10 MS/s Asynchronous SAR A/D Converter by integrating the calibration scheme into the A/D Converter. The 8 -bit Asynchronous SAR A/D Converter consists of a track-and-hold followed by a two-step conversion process. The two-step architecture consists of a 1 -bit course and a 7 -bit fine converter. The 1 -bit coarse converter is implemented using the SAR-CC principle and the 7 -bit fine converter is implemented using the CABS principle. The 7 -bit CABS sub-A/D converter consists of 127 comparators with differ-ent threshold voltages. All these 127 comparators with different threshold voltages are calibrated using a calibration technique in which the thresholds are adjusted to the desired value by tuning the total current flowing through the differential pair in the comparator circuit. The calibration technique and the A/D converter have been designed in 0. 18 mm CMOS technology with a supply voltage of 3. 3 V.

40|$|This {{letter is}} focused on the modeling, analysis, and {{applications}} of microstrip lines loaded with pairs of electrically coupled complementary split-ring resonators (CSRRs). Typically, these epsilon-negative (ENG) metamaterial transmission lines are implemented by loading the line with a single CSRR (etched beneath the conductor strip) in the unit cell. This provides a stopband {{in the vicinity of the}} CSRR resonance. However, by loading the line with a pair of CSRRs per unit cell, it is possible to either implement a dual-band ENG transmission line (useful, for instance, as a dual-band notch filter), provided the CSRRs are tuned at different frequencies, or to design microwave sensors and <b>comparators</b> <b>based</b> on symmetry disruption (in this case by using identical CSRRs and by truncating symmetry by different means, e. g., asymmetric dielectric loading).
