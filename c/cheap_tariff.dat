30|$|Customers have {{to choose}} one tariff out of those offered from their local utilities. In order to select the optimal tariff, i.e., the one fitting their {{electricity}} consumption at a given time, customers need to match their current usage habits to the offered pricing schemes. As an example, consider an energy provider which is interested in moving energy consumption away from times with high demand because this decreases the amount of immediately available but expensive energy resources. In order to encourage customers to use energy at off-peak times, the provider could offer better tariffs for load profiles that are dissimilar to normal consumption profiles by, e.g., lowering a fixed-price tariff from 23 cents/kWh to 17 cents/kWh. As another example, in order to stimulate people loading their cars during the night instead of during the day, a load profile with high values during night might be associated with another <b>cheap</b> <b>tariff.</b> A convenient way to perform the matching of current and desired consumption profiles is for the customer to provide a current load profile, i.e., a recent energy usage record, to different energy providers or to a third party providing a matchmaking service for tariffs offered by various energy providers.|$|E

40|$|In South Africa, where 75 % of {{the worlds}} {{platinum}} is produced, electricity tariffs have increased significantly over recent years. This introduces challenges to the energy intensive mineral processing industry. Within the mineral processing chain, run-of-mine ore milling circuits are the most energy-intensive unit processes. Opportunities to reduce the operating costs associated with power consumption through process control are explored in this work. In order to reduce operating costs, demand side management was implemented on a milling circuit using load shifting. Time-of-use tariffs were exploited by shifting power consumption of the milling circuit from more expensive to <b>cheaper</b> <b>tariff</b> periods {{in order to reduce}} overall costs associated with electricity consumption. Reduced throughput during high tariff periods was recovered during low tariff periods in order to maintain milling circuit throughput over a week long horizon. In order to implement and evaluate demand side management through process control, a load shifting controller was developed for the non-linear Hulbert model. Implementation of the load shifting controller was achieved through a multi-layered control approach. A regulatory linear MPC controller was developed to address technical control requirements such as milling circuit stability. A supervisory real-time optimizer was developed to meet economic control requirements such as reducing electricity costs while maintaining throughput. Scenarios, designed to evaluate the sensitivities of the load shifting controller, showed interesting results. Mill power set-point optimization was found to be proportionally related to the mineral price. Set-points were not sensitive to absolute electricity costs but rather to the relationships between peak, standard, and off-peak electricity costs. The load shifting controller was most effective at controlling the milling circuit where weekly throughput was between approximately 90 % and 100 % of the maximum throughput capacity. From an economic point of view, it is shown that for milling circuits that are not throughput constrained, load shifting can reduce operating costs associated with electricity consumption. Simulations performed indicate that realizable cost savings are between R 16. 51 and R 20. 78 per gram of unrefined platinum processed by the milling circuit. This amounts to a potential annual cost saving of up to R 1. 89 m for a milling circuit that processes 90 t/h at a head grade of 3 g/t. Dissertation (MEng) [...] University of Pretoria, 2015.

In March 1874, en route from Knysna to Cape Town and under captain Knud Thomasen, she struck a reef off Cape Agulhas and went down. The {{passengers}} and crew were stranded for three days on Dyer Island before being rescued by local fishermen and then travelling by wagon to Caledon. The Thesens' next vessel was the 191-ton brig Ambulant which, in 1883, was the first ship to take on cargo at the new Government Wharf off Thesen's Island, the cargo consisting of 3 000 railway sleepers to Cape Town. Competition from the Castle and Union Lines forced Thesen's to shut down this route and Ambulant was sold off in 1884. This was followed in 1895 by the 427-ton mail packet Agnar, a steamship nicknamed 'Agony' by the local school children she regularly carried to boarding schools in Cape Town. She stayed in service for some 40 years, as troop carrier for the British colonial government in the Boer War (1899-1902) and for the German government in the Herero Wars in German South-West Africa (1904-1907). She {{was taken over by}} a business in Madagascar in 1934 and was lost in a cyclone off Mauritius in 1938. The 706-ton Ingerid was taken into service in 1901 and the 600-ton Karatara in 1913. The 1019-ton Outeniqua joined the fleet in 1915, the 139-ton Clara converted from a sand barge and suction dredger and the 216-ton Nautilus in 1917. The Outeniqua was the company's flagship, could accommodate fifty passengers and remained in service until 1945. In 1916 the Thesen Line became the Thesen's Steamship Company, but the coastal shipping trade was languishing. Vessels which had been conscripted during World War I were free to ply commercial routes after the War, leading to keen competition. Improvements in the road and rail infrastructure, particularly the opening of the George-Knysna railway line in 1928, led to <b>cheaper</b> <b>tariffs</b> for travel by land. The Thesen family sold off four of its eight vessels, and in 1921 the entire company with the remaining Agnar, Ingerid, Outeniqua and Clara.

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesHistorically, South Africans {{have benefited}} from {{relatively}} <b>cheap</b> electricity where <b>tariffs</b> have not been cost reflective and kept below inflation. Tariff structures have not fully accounted {{for the cost of}} investing in new infrastructure for generating, transmitting and finally distributing electricity to the end user. This has partly contributed to an inadequate and constrained electricity supply that is insufficient to meet the growing energy demand in South Africa e. g. the 2008 rolling blackouts (Tait 2011). Since 2004 the average electricity tariff has however increased above inflation to be able to invest in Eskom’s New Build Programme. The increases between 2008 and 2011 were particularly high, in the range of 16 – 22 in real terms. The National Electricity Regulator of South Africa approved an ‘above inflation’ annual average increase of 8 on the 1 April 2013 for Eskom customers and 1 July for municipal customers (NERSA 2013). The sectors however, do not experience the same degree of increase. This study aims to measure the increases experienced by urban poor households and determine the effect of the increases on their energy choices. It was initiated mainly to address concerns that Eskom’s tariff increases may affect the access and longterm affordability of electricity for the poor. Electricity is foundational to society’s ability to function well and without it essential services such as lighting, cooking and virtually anything electronic, will be negatively affected. Thus, any threat to service delivery {{on the side of the}} utility and affordability on the side of the customer should both be addressed by pro-poor policies. Eberhard and PDG (2010 : 2) made a compelling argument that if Eskom cannot extend their generation capacity, which is partly financed through a tariff, then this is not pro-poor. Increasing tariffs so that it is more cost reflective is essential to achieve the objective of meeting the growing electricity demand in the face of an ageing electricity network and a historically <b>cheap</b> electricity price. <b>Tariff</b> increases are inevitable. The real question therefore is how to balance the needs of the utility and the customer; the price of service delivery and the level of affordability, especially for the poor...|$|R

The UK domestic sector {{accounts for more than}} a quarter of total energy use. This energy use can be reduced through more efficient building operations. The energy efficiency can be improved through better control of heating in houses, which account for a large portion of total energy consumption. The energy consumption can be lowered by using renewable energy systems, which will also help the UK government to meet its targets towards reduction in carbon emissions and generation of clean energy. Building control has gained considerable interest from researchers and much improved ways of control strategies for heating and hot water systems have been investigated. This intensified research is because heating systems represent a significant share of our primary energy consumption to meet thermal comfort and indoor air quality criteria. Advances in computing control and research in advanced control theory have made it possible to implement advanced controllers in building control applications. Heating control system is a difficult problem because of the non-linearities in the system and the wide range of operating conditions under which the system must function. A model of a two zone building was developed in this research to assess the performance of different control strategies. Two conventional (On-Off and proportional integral controllers) and one advanced control strategies (model predictive controller) were applied to a solar heating system combined with a heat pump. The building was modelled by using a lumped approach and different methods were deployed to obtain a suitable model for an air source heat pump. The control objectives were to reduce electricity costs by optimizing the operation of the heat pump, integrating the available solar energy, shifting electricity consumption to the <b>cheaper</b> night-time <b>tariff</b> and providing better thermal comfort to the occupants. Different climatic conditions were simulated to test the mentioned controllers. Both on-off and PI controllers were able to maintain the tank and room temperatures to the desired set-point temperatures however they did not make use of night-time electricity. PI controller and Model Predictive Controller (MPC) based on thermal comfort are developed in this thesis. Predicted mean vote (PMV) was used for controlling purposes and it was modelled by using room air and radiant temperatures as the varying parameters while assuming other parameters as constants. The MPC dealt well with the disturbances and occupancy patterns. Heat energy was also stored into the fabric by using lower night-time electricity tariffs. This research also investigated the issue of model mismatch and its effect on the prediction results of MPC. MPC performed well when there was no mismatch in the MPC model and simulation model but it struggled when there was a mismatch. A genetic algorithm (GA) known as a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA II) was used to solve two different objective functions, and the mixed objective from the application domain led to slightly superior results. Overall results showed that the MPC performed best by providing better thermal comfort, consuming less electric energy and making better use of cheap night-time electricity by load shifting and storing heat energy in the heating tank. The energy cost was reduced after using the model predictive controller...|$|R
40|$|This report {{recommends}} a {{change to the}} way consumers pay for the network that carries electricity from generators to homes, so that it better reflects the cost of running the network. Overview Australians are paying too much for power. In the five years to 2013, the average household power bill rose 70 per cent: from $ 970 to $ 1660 a year. The prices we pay are also unfair: some people are paying more than their fair share. These consumers are paying on average about $ 150 a year more than they should to subsidise other consumers. To get fairer and <b>cheaper</b> prices, network <b>tariffs</b> need urgent reform. Electricity networks transport power from generators to our homes and businesses. Like roads and freeways, they are built at a size to keep electricity moving at times of maximum demand – peak hour. Yet the price we pay to use electricity networks is the same whatever {{the time of day}} or season. The price therefore provides no incentive to use the network efficiently by avoiding peak times. It also provides little incentive for network owners to invest efficiently because it is unrelated to their main cost: building enough infrastructure to meet peak demand and avoid blackouts. Network owners spent $ 17. 6 billion on expanding power networks between 2009 and 2013. If prices had encouraged consumers to use less power in periods of peak demand, $ 7. 8 billion of this investment could have been avoided and the savings passed on as lower power bills. It is widely agreed that reform is needed. Yet {{there is a lack of}} specific proposals to improve the structure and operation of network tariffs. This report, the third in a series of Grattan reports on the excessive cost of electricity, fills that gap. It proposes two major reforms to the way network companies charge customers for the cost of carrying power to homes and small businesses. First, the 43 per cent of the consumer bill that goes to fund the network should no longer be based on total energy use. Instead, consumers should pay for the maximum load they put on the network. This tariff is called a capacity-based charge because it is based on the capacity of the infrastructure that must be built to carry this maximum load. A capacity charge far better reflects the cost of building and running the network. Yet this reform alone may not reduce peak demand in areas where the network is under pressure. Therefore the report also proposes the introduction of a new tariff in areas that - in the absence of prices that better reflect the cost of running the network - will require expensive infrastructure upgrades. Under this tariff, consumers will be charged more for use during times (usually in summer) when the network is under most strain. Because these periods drive total investment in infrastructure, reducing peak demand levels ultimately leads to lower prices. These reforms will give all consumers incentives to use electricity more efficiently. When they do, the pressure on network companies to invest in infrastructure will fall, and power prices with it. But governments must commit to these reforms and carefully explain their benefits. Advanced electricity meters will need to be installed on most Australian homes, at material shortterm cost. Politicians may decide it is too hard. But if they do, they will miss an opportunity to deliver cheaper and fairer power prices.  ...|$|R
