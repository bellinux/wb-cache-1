5000|$|.....It is an {{unrecorded}} {{part of my}} father’s {{work that}} he had the whole picture of the river channel so fully in his mind, with his almost day to day information as to what the mighty Mississippi was about that he felt himself able, where other men would be in doubt, to take the wheel of the big passenger and <b>cargo</b> <b>boats,</b> <b>carrying</b> several hundred people, and pilot them himself down through some treacherous reach of the channel, often rising from his bed at night to do so. He was accepted as a welcome aide by the regular pilots who must know the long stretches of the river but could sometimes not be quite sure in the particularly difficult and rapidly changing channel." ...|$|R
50|$|The hooker {{refers to}} four classes of boats. All are named in Irish. The Bád Mór (big boats) ranges in length from 10.5 to 13.5 metres (35 to 44 feet). The smaller Leathbhád (half boat) is about 10 metres (28 feet) in length. Both the Bád Mór and Leathbhád were decked {{forward of the}} mast. These boats were used to carry turf {{to be used as}} fuel across Galway Bay from Connemara and County Mayo to the Aran Islands and the Burren. The boats often brought {{limestone}} on the return journeys, to neutralise the acid soils of Connemara and Mayo. The Gleoiteog ranges in length from 7 to 9 metres (24 to 28 feet) and has the same sails and rigging as the larger boats. They were used for fishing and <b>carrying</b> <b>cargo.</b> Another <b>boat,</b> the Púcán, is similar in size to the Gleoiteog but has a lug mainsail and a foresail. These smaller boats were entirely open.|$|R
40|$|AbstractPrediction of <b>cargo</b> <b>carrying</b> {{capacity}} {{provides a}} base for planning railway networks, decision-making about the operations of railway freight companies, and development of transport scheme. The application of system dynamics assists in the predication of railway <b>cargo</b> <b>carrying</b> capacity. Through {{the analysis of the}} key factors that influence <b>cargo</b> <b>carrying</b> capacity in the railway freight system, the boundary for railway <b>cargo</b> <b>carrying</b> capacity system is determined; the system cause-effect relationship containing six feedback loops is determined; the system flow and simulation formula is constructed; the model for the development of system dynamics-based railway <b>cargo</b> <b>carrying</b> capacity is constructed. With the statistical data about railway freight in China from 1900 to 2009, simulation tests are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the application of system dynamics model in the prediction of railway freight. The railway <b>cargo</b> <b>carrying</b> capacity is predicted from the time from 2011 to 2015. In 2015, it is predicted to reach 5. 40486 billion tons. The error analyses indicate that the maximum error of system prediction is 2. 66 %...|$|R
