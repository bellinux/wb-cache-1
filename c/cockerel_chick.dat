40|$|ABSTRACT In Experiment 1, {{two types}} of {{hatchery}} wastes, including <b>cockerel</b> <b>chicks</b> (CC), and shell waste (SW) blended with CC (60 : 40 CC:SW), were ground and mixed with a by-product carbohydrate (5, 10, and 15 % wt/wt) {{with or without a}} bacterial culture and fer-mented for a period of 21 d. <b>Cockerel</b> <b>chicks</b> fermented with 15 % carbohydrate and the culture had a pleasant smell and little H 2 S production. Elevated H 2 S concentra-tions were recorded for CC:SW samples at all carbohy-drate levels when the culture was not added. No NH 3 was detected from any treatments during fermentation. The addition of culture to the CC and CC:SW by-products resulted in pH values lower (P < 0. 05) than those without culture on Day 21, and the 15 % carbohy-drate treatment significantly reduced pH beyond the 5 % carbohydrate. Final proximate composition of CC and CC:SW samples with culture were not significantly different from those without culture added. In Experiment 2, carbohydrate was added at 10. 0, 13. 3, 16. 7, and 20. 0 % wt/wt to CC and CC:SW {{in the presence of the}} bacterial culture. Shell waste alone was fermented with 15, 20, and 25 % carbohydrate and the culture. Moisture level in this experiment was adjusted to approximately 70 % for all treatments. The lowest pH for the CC and CC:SW treatments was observed at the 16. 7 % carbohydrate level. Shell waste pH was better maintained at the 20 and 25 % carbohydrate levels.

40|$|In {{a series}} of polybrominated {{biphenyl}} (PBB) feeding trials in White Leghorn <b>cockerel</b> <b>chicks,</b> the effects of PBB on various physiological parameters and organ weights were determined. These measurements included: growth, thyroid function, ECG, cardiac output, blood pressure, hematocrit, erythropoietin levels, and spleen, bursa of Fabricius, thyroid, testes, comb, liver weights. In addition, tissues were histologically examined. PBB, in the commercial grade form of hexabromobiphenyl, was administered continuously in the diet at levels ranging from 50 to 250 ppm. Pair-feeding studies were conducted to ascertain {{the effects of the}} drug per se since preliminary trials indicated that PBB administration resulted in decreased feed intake. Chronic administration resulted in depressed body weight as a result of decreased feed intake; decreased comb, testes, spleen, and bursa weights; increased liver and thyroid weight; hydropericardium and ascites; decreased hematological values due to depressed plasma erythropietin levels; decreased heart rate, packed cell volume, hemoglobin and cardiac output; decreased voltage amplitude of the ECG and a shift in the mean electrical axis.

40|$|Toxicity to <b>cockerel</b> <b>chicks</b> of raw full-fat neem seed kernel (RFK) was tested. Graded {{doses of}} 0, 75, 150, 225 and 300 g RFK/kg diet {{replaced}} similar levels of peanut. Each diet was offered to 30 chicks ad libitum for 35 days. The RFK depressed (P< 0. 05) appetite and severely (P< 0. 01) decreased mass gain of chicks {{independent of the}} doses used. It also induced haemorrhagic anaemia (P< 0. 01) and leucocytosis (P< 0. 05) at 150 g or more RFK/kg diet. The leucocytosis largely resulted from heterophilia. At an inclusion rate of 150 g or more RFK/kg, aspartate aminotransferase activity was elevated (P< 0. 05) while cholesterol concentration was lowered (P< 0. 05). However, activity of alanine aminotransferase and concentrations of bilirubin, creatinine and uric acid {{did not differ significantly}} among the cockerels. Lesions associated with RFK included emaciation and paleness of carcasses, kidney congestion and mucous enteritis. Microscopically, there was coagulative necrosis of mucosal cells involving the submucosal glands and sloughing of intestinal villi, focal hepatocytic drop-out and haemorrhagic and oedematous nephritis.

The chicks displayed significantly lower retention levels than control birds that had been injected with antisera to carbonic anhydrase, or with saline (p <. 01). S- 100 α antisera had an amnestic effect when injected between 0 and 20 min after training, with memory deficits occurring from 30 min post-learning, at the point of transition between the A and the B phases of the Gibbs-Ng intermediate memory stage. By contrast, the S- 100 β antisera needed to be injected either 5 min before or immediately after training and produced amnesia 10 min earlier, {{at the start of the}} A phase of the intermediate memory stage.

40|$|The {{effects of}} dietary levels of {{manganese}} (Mn) in inorganic (MnO) and organic (Mn fumarate) forms were evaluated on <b>cockerel</b> <b>chicks.</b> A basal corn-soybean diet with 23 mg/kg Mn {{was supplemented with}} levels of 0, 30, 60 and 240 ppm Mn from both Mn sources. Each treatment was replicated in five pens of 10 chicks. The chicks were fed diets ad libitum from 14 to 49 days of age, after which five birds per treatment were sacrificed for pathomorphological examinations and analysis. The treatments did not exert significant effects on the body weight (BW), the feed/gain (F/G) ratio or the mortality rate. According to the necropsy findings, no growth retardation or emaciation occurred in either of the groups and {{the differences in the}} average absolute and relative organ weights were not significant (P ? 0. 05). Tissue analysis indicated that the tibia showed the greatest response to Mn, followed by the liver and kidney. Accumulation in the tibia was higher (P < 0. 05) with supplements of 30, 60 and 240 mg/kg from both Mn sources (3. 71, 3. 78, 4. 44, and 3. 68, 4. 00, 4. 36 mg/kg DM, MnO and Mn fumarate, respectively) compared to the control group (3. 21 mg/kg). Accumulation in the liver increased significantly (P < 0. 05) only with supplements of 60 and 240 ppm independently of the Mn source (12. 7, 14. 2, and 14. 0, 14. 9 mg/kg, respectively) compared to the control (9. 8 mg/kg).

40|$|The {{influence}} of delayed feeding on the performance, development and response of {{immune system to}} Newcastle disease vaccination were investigated. 72 day old <b>cockerel</b> <b>chicks</b> purchased from a local hatchery were used. These were at the onset {{divided into two groups}} A and B of equal numbers (n = 36) and housed separately. Group A was provided with a diet containing 25 % crude protein and 2800 Kcal of metabolizable energy from the day of hatch while group B was deprived of feed for the first 72 h post hatch (ph) after which they were introduced to feed and thereafter maintained on same diet as group A. Once feeding is commenced in each of the groups, same regimen was maintained till the end of the study. Other brooding arrangements were common to the groups. 21 days ph 12 chicks were randomly selected per group, weighed, sacrificed after which two blood samples were collected for general haematology and serum biochemistry respectively. They were then necropsied and lymphoid organs as bursa of fabricius, spleen and caecal tonsil as well as liver harvested weighed and their relative weights calculated. The remaining 24 chicks per group were then vaccinated with Newcastle Disease (ND) vaccine lasota R. Five days later, 12 chicks were again randomly elected per group and same operations as on day 21 carried out on the chicks. On day 42 ph, all the remaining chicks in each of the groups were vaccinated against ND using ND vaccine komarov R and 5 days later, they were sacrificed and again all the activities of day 21 repeated. Our results showed that delaying feeding for up to 72 h ph does not significantly affect the growth, development and function of some organs of the immune system. Moreover, it also produced no effect on Packed Cell Volume early in life as significant variation between the two groups (p< 0. 05) was only observed on day 47 ph. However, our finding showed that early feeding significantly improved early response to vaccinations (p< 0. 05) shown by higher geometric mean antibody titre. There were no differences in organ morphology and histopathology between the two groups. The study demonstrated that early feeding could be beneficial in the response of chicks to early vaccinations but does not confer other productive advantage...|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} 72 day old <b>cockerel</b> Harco <b>chicks</b> {{purchased}} {{from a local}} hatchery were used to investigate the effect of feed quality on the development and function of immune system in chicken. Upon procurement, they were divided into 3 equal groups (n = 24) and brooded separately in three mini deep litter brooder pens with adequate brooding requirement Three diets with crude protein contents of 26, 22 and 17 % were prepared and from day zero of hatch till day 26, chicks in group A were fed 26 while groups B and C were fed 22 and 17 % respectively. During and after brooding, signs of ill health such as diarrhoea, anorexia, huddling, drooping of wings, coughing and mortality were carefully monitored. Post brooding, each group retained its pen but all the groups were maintained on one diet, lpd on which they were fed {{till the end of}} the study. On day 21 Post Hatch (PH), 8 chicks per group were randomly selected, weighed individually and their group means and standard deviation calculated. They were subsequently sacrificed and through jugular venipunture, 2 ml of blood was collected into an anticoagulant bottle for general haematology while 5 mls was collected into a non anticoagulant containing bottle for serum biochemistry and serology. This was followed by necropsy of all the chicks after which some lymphoid organs and the liver were harvested and their weights determined followed by that of their relative weights. The remaining birds in each group were vaccinated with ND vaccine lasota R. Five days later, all the operations of day 21 were repeated. The remaining chicks in the group were hereafter maintained on 17 % CP till day 42 PH when they were vaccinated with ND Komarov R vaccine. Five days later, all the operations of day 21 were repeated.

40|$|The {{influence}} of fish oil (highly unsaturated) and beef tallow (highly saturated) with vitamin E (100 IU/kg) supplementation on the antioxidant status of broiler chicken <b>cockerels</b> was investigated. <b>Chicks</b> were fed a control diet with no added fat, 40 g/kg each of fish oil and beef tallow diets, respectively, from 11 to 42 days of age. Tocopherol concentration {{and the rate}} of lipid peroxidation, thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) in liver, fatty acid composition of the liver lipids, blood serum total antioxidant status (TAS), and reduced glutathione (GSH) content were determined. Vitamin E supplementation of the diet increased liver ?-tocopherol content in chicks regardless of the type of dietary fat. Fish oil diet resulted in higher liver TBARS value while beef tallow diet showed lower values compared to the control diet. Vitamin E supplementation reduced liver TBARS as well as serum GSH, and raised serum TAS for all diets. Serum GSH was the same for vitamin E supplemented diets regardless of the fat supplement. Fish oil diets resulted in a significant increase in hepatic lipid n- 3 PUFA content. A significant positive correlation was found between liver TBARS and n- 3 PUFA content. No relationships were established, however, between liver TBARS and n- 6 PUFA or saturated fatty acids. The results suggest that feeding oils rich in n- 3 PUFA increases tissue concentration of these fatty acids, consequently increasing tissue lipid peroxidation and reducing the antioxidative status of broiler chickens. Supplementing high levels of vitamin E with such oils may increase tissue oxidative stability. Serum TAS or GSH may be used as a measure of antioxidative status in chickens. ...|$|R
