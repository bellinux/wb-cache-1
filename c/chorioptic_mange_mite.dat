A random number table was used to allocate subjects to receive doramectin (group D, eight animals) or fipronil (group F, nine animals).

A total of 810 animals from both species (384 sheep and 421 goats) were sampled using the formula of [1]. The study showed that the prevalence of <b>mange</b> <b>mite</b> in sheep and goats was 3. 34 % and 5. 94 %, respectively. From 197 and 613, young and adult small ruminants examined for <b>mange</b> <b>mites</b> the recorded prevalence rate was 6. 09 % and 4. 61 %, respectively whereas among 373 and 437, male and female small ruminants examined for <b>mange</b> <b>mites</b> the prevalence rate of 4. 02 and 5. 26 % was recorded, respectively. The prevalence rate recorded in lowland and midland was 4. 22 % and 2. 77 %, respectively. No statistically significant association was observed between the prevalence rate and different species, age and sex of the animals (p> 0. 05). However, there was statistically significant association between the prevalence rate of mange infestation and agro-ecological zones (p< 0. 05). The major species of mites identified were sarcoptes spp, psoroptes spp and demodex spp in goat and only psoroptes spp in sheep. From the <b>mange</b> <b>mite</b> species-affecting goats, sarcoptes scabies was the most prevalent species observed on 4. 28 % of the goats followed by psoroptes ovis (0. 95 %) and demodex caprae (0. 71 %).

40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} carried out in order to {{determine}} the prevalence of <b>mange</b> <b>mite</b> of goats, their species composition and associated risk factors in and around Kombolcha, Northeastern Ethiopia. Both questionnaire and cross-sectional study were employed. The result of the questionnaire survey indicated that goats were the main species of animals owned by the farmers and mange was a known and considered as an important disease by small ruminant holders. The cross sectional study {{was carried out}} on 350 goats (238 female and 112 male). Accordingly the overall infestation rate of <b>mange</b> <b>mites</b> was 11. 7 % (41 of 350). Prevalence of 5. 1 % and 6. 6 % was observed in and around Kombolcha, respectively; however, there was insignificant difference (P> 0. 05) in the two study areas. The highest level of infestation was observed in female adult goats (9. 1 %) than in male adult goats (2. 6 %). However, there was no statistically significant difference (P> 0. 05) between the different age and sex groups. On the other hand, the prevalence of <b>mange</b> <b>mites</b> in poor body conditioned (7. 4 %) animals was significantly higher than (P< 0. 05) those of the good body condition (3. 1 %) animals. With regard to species composition Sarcoptes sp. and Demodex sp. were identified with the prevalence of 10. 6 % and 1. 1 %, respectively. Demodex sp. was not observed on good body conditioned and young goats, whereas, Sarcoptes sp. were found on both poor and good body condition as well as in different age groups. In conclusion, <b>mange</b> <b>mite</b> of goats had been observed to decrease in its extent of infestation problem because of the endeavors on disease control launched in the study area. Therefore, it was the suggestion of this study to further strengthen the efforts to put the disease under control...|$|R

40|$|Mites in {{the genus}} Chorioptes cause a mild form of skin disease in both {{domestic}} and wild ruminants. In July 2006, dermatitis characterized by alopecia, marked lichenification, accumulation of crust, and fissuring was recognized in 14 out of 200 Holstein dairy cattle raised in the cattle farm of the National Institute of Animal Science in Cheonan, Republic of Korea. Skin lesions were distributed mainly over the tail base, and sacral and perineal regions. Microscopic examinations of skin scraping samples from severely affected areas revealed numerous mites of all developmental stages. Morphologically, pedicels of the mites were short and unjointed. The tarsal suckers occurred on the pedicels of all the legs in the male worm and on the first, second, and fourth pair of legs in the adult female worm. A single long seta at the tarsus of legs III {{and the length of}} legs II being about twice as long as legs IV in adult male mites were observed. Arising anterior to the inner-most spatulate seta was a short seta with an average of 26. 4 ± 5. 8 µm in length. Also, the length of setae # 4 on the opisthosomal lobes was relatively short. Based on these observations, the mites were identified as Choriptes texanus.

40|$|This {{review article}} summarises the many {{reports in the}} literature, {{confirming}} that, in sheep, parasitic infections can adversely affect reproductive efficiency; examples, which refer to {{all parts of the}} reproductive cycle of sheep, are as follows: trichostrongylosis in ewe-lambs (which can lead to delayed attainment of puberty), myiosis of the prepuce (which can cause impediment of mating), <b>chorioptic</b> <b>mange</b> or trypanosomosis in rams (which can lead to testicular degeneration or azoospermia, respectively), trypanosomosis or sarcoptic mange in pre-conceptual ewes (which can lead to poor conception rates or reduced number of ovulations, respectively), toxoplasmosis or neosporosis in pregnant ewes (which are causes of abortion), trichostrongylosis or trematode infections in lactating ewes (which can cause reduction of milk yield and can be a risk factor for mastitis, respectively), cryptosporidiosis in newborn lambs (which can be a cause of deaths), coccidiosis in growing pre-weaned lambs (which can cause suboptimal growth rate). In other cases, the reproductive status of the animal can influence the parasitic infection; examples are as follows: the increase in faecal parasitic output during the peri-parturient period (as a consequence of the peri-parturient relaxation of immunity), the heavier trichostrongylid infections of twin lambs compared to lambs from single parities (as a consequence of developmental origin issues in twin lambs). All the above examples support the idea of presence of interactions between parasitic infections and reproductive efficiency in sheep. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
